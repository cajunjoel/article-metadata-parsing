(Actitus macularia)
By Ryan B. Walden (Supervisor, Live Animal Programme), and
John R. Quinn (Staff Artist), Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, Penna, U.S.A.
The Spotted Sandpiper is one of the most common and generally
distributed of the summer-resident shore birds. The breeding range is
from Newfoundland, west to northern Alaska, and south to northern
South Carolina and southern California. With such a wide breeding range
it is of little wonder that the " Teeter Snipe ", as it is sometimes called,
is found in abundance on the small islands and sand-bars in the Delaware
River of eastern Pennsylvania.
Both parent birds work at the excavation of the nest, which is little more
than a hollow in the sand and gravel. The nest may be lined with bits
of grass, leaves or bark which help to hide the four pale, buffy-white eggs.
Incubation is often begun as soon as the first egg is laid ; therefore, it is
common for the last chick to hatch two days after the first chick hatches.
Nesting activity usually begins in mid- and late May ; but when the nest
is located on the sand-bars and islands, it is not unusual for the first nesting
attempt to be flooded out and a second nest begun in mid-June.
Shore birds often assemble in flocks, but it is rare to see more than one
or two Spotted Sandpipers in the same area. Flocks of more than one
family group are unusual even during migration. Another interesting
characteristic of this sand-piper is the strange way it balances its body on
its legs. The legs are slightly bent, the head and fore-part of the body
is lowered a little, and with clockwork regularity, the rump and tail are
raised and lowered in a curious jerking motion. Due to this strange
mannerism the Spotted Sandpiper is often called the " Tip-up " or
" Teeter-tail ". Young birds only a few hours old display the same
movements as the adults.
The Spotted Sandpiper can swim and dive, so if a chick is cornered
near the water, it will not hesitate to swim. The adults have been known
to dive below the surface of the water when chased by a hawk.

2 R. B. WALDEN AND J. R. QUINN--REARING THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER
On the 19th June, 1966, while observing the movements of several
types of birds on one of the islands in the Delaware River, we disturbed a
pair of Spotted Sandpipers. In the hope of finding the nest or young,
we remained quiet until the adults settled down. In a short while the
adults changed from the alarm call to one of lesser excitement, and three
young birds were observed materializing from the pebbles and grasses, j
about ten feet away from us. It was decided that an attempt would be
made to capture the chicks, so that a comparison in growth and develop- j
ment rates could be made with three Piping Plover chicks which had been 1
incubated in captivity. The moment we began to move, the young birds
froze and seemed to disappear. The location of each bird was marked,
but due to the excellent protective coloration and the fading sunlight,
only one bird was captured. It was our desire to catch all three birds so
that age and growth data could be gained, and only the youngest kept to
be placed with the two-day old plovers. 1
After carefully checking, it was decided that the bird which had been
captured was about three days old. As soon as the sandpiper was put in
with the plovers, it began to feed. The chick was given a balanced ration
of Purina Game Bird Starter, egg yolk, small mealworms and chopped
greens. The rate of growth was quite rapid, and within ten days the
sandpiper could fly very well. The only problem encountered in raising
this bird was that the plovers started to pick at its toes ; but with an
increase in the amount of mealworms fed, the toe-picking stopped as f
quickly as it began.
The propagation of captive shore-birds is yet an infant endeavour,
although few forms have been bred successfully in zoological parks. One ;
must understand, though, that as man and his works push inexorably
north to the great tundra nurseries of this family, shore-bird aviculture
will cease its role as an interesting pastime and become a dire necessity. ;
Let us begin to explore the problems now, while time is still with us.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
This has been a year of transition at Cleres. After the long illness and
subsequent passing away of Frank Fooks, who had run things there so
long and so well, a complete reorganization had become necessary. It
has now been successfully effected, but it took time, and it was not too
easy to give young birds all the attention they needed during the last season.
Also the unexpected cold weather in April and May, after an unusually
mild winter, caused the infertility of many clutches, particularly among the
geese.
We have to contend with all sorts of parasites and virus diseases as
is the case on all grounds where birds have been introduced and kept for a
long time, coming from all parts of the world. Young birds have often
to be treated if losses are to be kept at a minimum. Fortunately Dr.
Ciarpaglini is highly competent in such matters. But it means a lot of
work. There is little doubt that better rearing accommodation, particu-
larly for waterfowl and game birds, will result in greater success in 1968.
There were, however, some satisfactory hatchings during the last breeding
season.
For the first time in many years, two young Emus were hatched and
raised. We had lost hope of ever obtaining young from our pair. The
! male sat every winter on a nest of clear eggs, and he still did so last Feb-
ruary. But the hen laid four mpre eggs in March, and, to our astonish-
ment, two proved fertile. One hatched under the male, who kicked it
out at once. Found stiff and cold outside the nest, it was fortunately
revived, while the second egg was removed and hatched in an incubator.
The two Emus were successfully reared, although they were infected by
the species of gape worms affecting geese and cranes, at the age of two
months.
Over twenty Rheas, both grey and white, were reared. We allow the
males to incubate as much as we can, but remove the eggs on the eve of
hatching to avoid accidents, the chicks being raised in a heated shed.
They have to be carefully fed : coarse green food often causes intestinal
obstruction, while an excess of protein produces leg deformation and
weakness, as the birds develop too fast.
We had no young cranes ; several pairs of Demoiselles sat on infertile
clutches. Our old breeding pair of Stanleys met with a tragic end,
being killed and carried away, as well as several geese, in the deer park
across the road. We naturally thought that it was the work of a fox, but
the trap we set caught a genuine European Wild Cat, a female weighing
11 lbs. It was an almost incredible record, as the species had not been
found in Normandy for over a hundred years.
Dr. Ciarpaglini, who has been very successful in rearing Flamingoes at
the Paris Zoo for the last six years, wants to try with those at Cleres.

The three large species (Central American, Chilean and European) have
been transferred to the lake, a more suitable breeding location. James's
Andeans are doing well on the clear, cold water of the river, which however
proved unsuitable to the tropical Lesser Flamingoes. These have to be
kept on more stagnant, warmer pools.
Black and Black-necked Swans nested successfully after having pro-
duced infertile clutches in April. This had never happened before.
Very few geese were reared, the best being four Orinoces and five
Andeans. There were common, South African and Ruddy Shelducks ;
two dozen Fulvous Whistling Ducks ; Philippine, Lesser Grey, Falcated,
Laysan and Red-billed Ducks ; Chestnut, Cape, Marbled and Puna Teal ;
New Zealand Scaups, White-eyes, Red-crested Pochards, Carolina
and Mandarins in numbers. We failed to rear a brood of eight Hooded
Mergansers, although we tried force feeding.
Among the game birds we had young Malayan Firebacks, Hume's,
Cheer and Grey Peacock Pheasants, Red and Ceylon Junglefowls, and
many peafowls.
Brush Turkey, at liberty in the park, did well. We started with a cock
and two hens (one of which died in the summer by accident). There was
also an old male in the Emus' enclosure, but he was killed by these un-
predictable big birds after living with them for two years. The male in the
park first built a large mound close to the clutch, along the fence. There
was plenty of dead leaves and humus, which we supplemented with fresh
lawn clippings. He worked hard and we caught four chicks in the neigh-
bourhood in August. Before that time he had started another mound
high up in the park, in a wood, about 800 feet away, and for over a month
he worked at both nests, running from one to the other several times each
day. We later caught four more chicks in the wood, and there may be
more of them in the park. We place the chicks we catch in a large,
planted aviary containing many other birds, including Peacock pheasants,
where they grow without difficulty. When first hatched, they are as
large and strong as ordinary three week old chickens. They never fight,
but they pay no attention to one another, and they perch up most of the day.
A number of California and Painted Quails, Pigeons, Doves, Parrakeets
and some green Cardinals were reared, the best being Wongas, Brush and
Common Bronzewings and Grey-headed Doves. An Olive Pigeon and an
Australian Pheasant tailed Dove left the nest, but both drowned in a near-
by pool, which will be duly altered to avoid such accidents.
Our collection of cage and aviary birds still is large. Part of the indoor
ones will be shown next year to better advantage, as we plan to change the
largest hall of the chateau (ruined by fire in 1939) into a " Jewel Room "
like the one I established at the New York Zoo in 1942. There will be
a dark gallery, 10 feet wide and 50 feet long, with twenty-four windows
opening on cages 3 feet by 3 feet, with proper lighting and service at the
back. This should be an important improvement.

(Steganura paradisea)
By Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Weeks (Krugersdorp, South Africa)
On entering Aviary No. 1 on the evening of 15th February, 1967, I saw
what I thought was a young Melba Finch fly out from under the shelter.
The following evening I saw the bird again and noticed no red on the tail
feathers or green on the back like a normal young Melba finch. This bird
was a dull grey all over.
No. 1 aviary is 47 feet by 12 feet by 7 feet high with a covered shelter on
the south (cold) side, a brick wall on the east and north sides, wire netting
on the west side, and planted with flowering shrubs and three peach trees,
which were there before the aviaries were built. It houses a mixed collec-
tion of some forty to fifty birds including Violet-ears, Stars, Melodious
Cubans, Fire Finches, Cordon-bleus, Shaft-tails (Queen Whydah), Melba
Finches and a pair of Paradise Whydah birds.
On the 18th February, while feeding the birds I saw the Melba cock
feeding two young Paradise Whydahs. I never disturb any nests so I
cannot describe the eggs but presume them to be identical to the Melbas.
In the meantime the hen Melba had gone to nest again in a red cestrum
bush. The Paradise Whydah hen was very interested in the new nest.
On the 19th the hen Whydah was observed flying from a perch fastened to
the top of the aviary and into the red cestrum in front of the nest and back
to the perch again. The hen Melba refused to budge from the nest. The
same day we phoned the Treasurer of the West Rand Bird Club who with
his son came to inspect the two young Whydahs. While they were there
they also observed the young begging for food from the Melba Finches.
On the 22nd three committee members from the West Rand Wild Bird
Club came to inspect the young birds which are now big, strong and
healthy and flying well.
I am now hoping for some youngsters from the second Melba nest.
Thanks to our loyal servants Martha and Simon, who place termites
(white ants) in the aviary for the birds while my wife and I are at work,
the chances of the birds living were excellent.
A Senior Inspector of Flora and Fauna has since been to see the young
birds and is satisfied that they were bred in captivity and that this is the
first time that this species has been bred in South Africa.
On Saturday, 4th March, I inspected the Melba's nest. There were
nine eggs--five smaller than the other four eggs. One egg had a small
hole in it which I enlarged with my finger nail. The baby bird was alive.
I later observed sitting on the nest a Melba Finch. On the 5th day both
birds were sitting during the day. On the 6th March after returning
from work it was observed that the nest had been completely destroyed
with no trace of eggs.

On 8th March I discussed the destroying of the eggs and nest with Mr.
Hindly from Flora and Fauna. He said he thought the hen Whydah was
the culprit as they have a tendency to eat eggs.
On Monday, 8th May, 1967, two more young Paradise Whydahs were I
seen in Aviary No. 1. The following evening both birds were seen being
fed by the Melba cock ; at no time did I notice the Melba hen near, or
feeding the young birds. It takes about two to three months for the young
to moult from their juvenile feathers to the adult plumage of the hen
Whydah. It is going to be very interesting to see how long it will take to
moult into the adult plumage of the cock birds, if there are any at all in
the young that I have bred. I hope to have bred at least one cock.
Note. January, 1968. Out of the four young birds bred we now have two !
hens and two cocks. These birds are in full adult plumage and the young
cocks are beautiful specimens.

This unique breeding took place in March, 1967, in Aviary No. 13. The
size of the aviary is 50 feet by 20 feet by 7 feet, with a covered shelter on
the south, and brick wall on the west and north, and wire netting on the
east side. Planted in the aviary are four fig trees, three peach trees,
ornamental and flowering shrubs, and well grassed on the ground with a
shallow drinking pond and running water.
On entering the aviary on the evening of the 2nd March I noticed in a
small cotoniaster shrub situated near the door three young birds which
appeared to be young Violet-eared Waxbills (Granatina granitina) and
on having a closer look I noticed that one young bird had no blue on the
rump as common in a young Violet-ear.
On the following evening three members of the West Rand Cage Bird
Club came to inspect the birds and verified them to be a young Shaft-tail
and two Violet-ears.
The following day a senior inspector from Flora and Fauna, Transvaal,
Mr. J. G. Hindly, verified the breeding to be a young Shaft-tail and two
Violet-ears.
On Sunday, 5th March, while watching the birds I saw two young birds
in the cotoniaster, a pair of Violet-ears flew into the shrub followed by
three young birds and the parents then commenced to feed all five young
birds.
We then realized that there were three Shaft-tails and two Violet-ears
from the one clutch. We reported this immediately to Flora and Funa
and I have in our possession a certificate of this wonderful breeding.

I am hoping that this is a first breeding of a Shaft-tail in captivity. The
birds in this aviary number between forty and fifty including Black-cheeks,
Black-throated Canaries, Peters' Twinspots, Lavender Finches, Star
Finches, Diamond Doves, Chinese Painted Quails, Quail Finches,
Namaqua Doves, one pair of Shaft-tails and three pairs of Violet-ears.
These birds are given white ants (termites) three times a day which I
collect in the veldt near my home. I keep them in buckets in my aviaries.
Note. January, 1968. Out of the three young birds bred there are two
hens and one cock. The young cock is now in full adult plumage; the old
cock bird has six long feathers and the young cock has four. The two
young Violet-ears turned out to be a pair and are now in full adult
plumage.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
During June and July, 1967 ,1 was able to make intermittent observations
on the nesting of a pair of Painted Quail (Excalfactoria chinensis) in an
inner aviary constructed in a greenhouse. The birds had been put into
the aviary in the spring and the hen had laid several eggs but ignored
them. Later I observed copulation on several occasions. As seems to
be the case with many species in which the pair remain together for a
long period, there was relatively little in the way of display. Any indica-
tion of readiness on the part of the female must have been of a fairly subtle
nature and passed unobserved. The male would follow close behind
her, drawn up tall with the ventral feathers fluffed, and then mount with
little ceremony, usually uttering a brief nasal note as they separated.
As in most aviary nestings the female laid her eggs in a variety of places.
As I have previously stated (Harrison, Restall, and Trollope, 1965) I do
not believe that this is typical of the species in its native habitat and I
suspect it to be related to a lack of a really satisfactory site. Since,
however, some game birds will desert a nest where they have been once
disturbed there is an alternative possibility that the various scattered eggs
might represent potential sites at which the hen has suffered some
disturbance subsequent to the laying of an egg. Nor do I believe the
statement, often repeated, that the female quail lays eggs in the vicinity
of the nest in order that these may decay and provide flies for the young
quail to feed on when they hatch. This story may have had a long life,
since Darwin mentions a similar explanation used by the South Americans
to account for odd eggs around the nests of Rheas; but there are a number
of reasons for doubting it. To begin with, the quails once they have

settled on a site will roll in any nearby eggs. Secondly, such eggs if left
do not get flyblown but stay complete and finally explode, as an aviculturist
friend recently discovered. Thirdly, even if such eggs were broken and
attacked by flies the maggots would have pupated and the flies flown long
before the end of the three-week incubation period. Finally, it has been
shown by experiment with other birds that eggs left lying around are
quickly taken by predators and that their presence causes the predators to
search in the vicinity and increases the likelihood that the nest will come
to grief.
The first two eggs of the pair under observation were laid in a bare
hollow in a corner, in spite of the fact that I had put in some grass-tufts.
The third egg was laid in the middle of the aviary. I moved the first two
to join it and the fourth was laid with these. The female then switched
to a new site on a flat open space covered with a layer of seed-husk, sand,
and dead grass-stems in which she made a shallow hollow and laid the
fifth and sixth eggs. I added the first four to these and the site was used for
subsequent eggs. The female began to incubate after she had laid the
tenth egg, but since the hollow finally held thirteen, three of these must
have been laid after incubation commenced.
On the first day of incubation a glance into the aviary at midday revealed
no sign of the female but a closer inspection showed that all the dead
grass-stems lying in the vicinity of the nest had been pulled over it until it
was completely concealed and formed a low mound from which the female's
head emerged at any unexpected noise. For the first three days of incuba-
tion the female quail continued this habit of completely concealing the
nest and herself beneath a mass of stems, but subsequently she discon-
tinued this and when she left the nest the cavity with its eggs would be
visible. This behaviour during the first few days of incubation would be
advantageous under natural conditions since the nest is usually in grass
and the hens action would result in the adjacent stems being pulled over
the nest to form a roof concealing the cavity. Similar behaviour occurs
in waders such as Redshank and Snipe, which nest in grasses and conceal
the nest-cup in this fashion.
Normally such behaviour would not be necessary after the first few
days, by which time the surrounding grasses would stay in place, but in the
rather bare aviary the nest was subsequently exposed when the female left
the eggs, apparently twice a day, for food and water. There may have
been some attempt to cover the eggs during this later period. I was not
sure since I never saw her actually leaving the nest, but the eggs towards
the edge of the nest would be partly concealed by material which could
have been either pulled over by the female, or pulled up against her while
she was sitting and have fallen when she moved away. When she returned
she would stand in the cup and, lowering her head, push back these grasses
with the forehead and culmen of the bill, rotating gradually and pushing
them back all round the cup before settling to incubate.

During the period of incubation the male visited her and sat with her
once or twice, but always roosted by himself well away from the nest, in
marked contrast to the normal conditions when the pair roosted together
in a tight huddle. The eggs hatched after about twenty-one days, the
female being found one morning with several newly-hatched chicks
around her. Only five eggs hatched, and one chick was found dead on
the nest. By midday the female was walking around the aviary with the
four young staggering after her. Although both birds tended the young
they showed no hesitation in climbing to low shelves or ledges where the
chicks had great difficulty in following, and twice I saw chicks that were in
the path of the parent casually trodden on.
There was a marked change in the behaviour and calls of the female.
Hitherto she had been subdued and secretive, using only the faint high-
pitched piping contact call. Now she used a loud mellow clucking note,
apparently in answer to the constant shrill piping of the chicks. For a
period after the hatching she became very excited when anyone approached
the aviary, and on several such occasions she uttered a crow exactly like
that of the cock but pitched about an octave lower. At other times she
was heard to use a shorter, modified version of the crow. If anyone
entered the aviary she would draw herself up as tall as possible, fluff
up all the body feathers (but not those of head and neck) until they were
erected almost into separate tracts and she appeared twice her normal
size, and droop and partly spread her wings. In this posture she would
rush towards the intruder in what appeared to be a threatening manner,
and which might effectively have frightened off some small animal.
Faced with a larger intruder who did not withdraw she would begin to
run about in a crazy manner, and had sufficient space been available
would almost certainly have performed a distraction display.
When the chicks became too large to brood they roosted clumped
together with the parents. On the occasions that this was observed the
chicks were grouped together between the parents. Two weeks after the
brood hatched the female began to lay again, but unfortunately died about
a week later from egg-binding. One young one was lost during my
absence. The remaining three consisted of two females and a male.
The young male began to show the adult plumage characters immediately,
passing from down to full adult plumage. The patterned throat and
chestnut-red tail coverts were apparent at an early stage in the feathering.
By the fifth week the three young and the male were roosting individually,
scattered a little apart from each other. By the end of the seventh week
the older male was beginning to crow frequently and after a day or two
was seen to attack the young male. They were separated, and it was then
noted that one hen was bullying another and it became necessary to
separate them also.
In an earlier article (Harrison, 1965) I described many of the more
typical calls and postures of these birds, and further observations have

IO C. J. O. HARRISON--NOTES ON BEHAVIOUR OF NESTING PAINTED QUAIL
enabled me to make a few supplementary notes on what seems to be a very
full vocabulary. The lower-pitched version of the male's crow as used
by the female during the first few days after the young were hatched was
heard again later in a different context. A different female of a young
pair was caught up and temporarily transferred to a cage within about
twelve feet of the enclosure where her partner was, with each bird out of !
sight of the other. When the male crowed it was immediately answered
by this lower-pitched crow from the female.
When the older male that had lost its mate was caged alone in an en-
closure next to the young pair, he changed his crow. When paired he
had used the high-pitched, usually triple-noted, " quee-kee-kew " call,
which was also used by the young male of the other pair. Once solitary
the male began to utter a note which in volume and pitch sounded like
the initial note of the three-note call but was long-drawn with a slight
dying fall to it. I noted it down as " queer ". This note has been
continually used, apparently in place of the other, while the bird has been
alone. If the triple-note call is the advertisement call of a mated male
and announces to nearby birds that can hear but not see him that he is
present, in possession of the area, and mated ; then it would be advan-
tageous, in the thick grass cover that these birds inhabit in the wilds, for
the solitary male to be able to announce to any stray female by use of a
different call that he was present, in possession of the area, and unmated.
There is yet another call-note which I heard on earlier occasions and
concerning the function of which I was a little uncertain. In view of the
occasions on which it has been elicited recently I suspect it to refer to the
sudden appearance of potential danger overhead, and therefore probably
functioning as an alarm call indicating the presence of a hawk or some other
flying predator. The bird uttering it crouches slightly, remaining still,
and gives a rapid and fairly loud ticking note. This persistent " tic, tic, ;
tic, tic, tic, ..." runs on in a long sequence and is uttered rather rapidly
but with a variable speed so that it alternately slows and accelerates.
This might be an accidental effect due to the strength of the bird's reaction,
but it produces a sound rather like some small machine driven by a rather
erratically-functioning motor.

Excalfactoria chinensis is well known to the aviculturist and a great deal
of material has been published on their husbandry. Ethologically they
are most interesting birds. Some aspects of their behaviour have been
recorded and discussed by Harrison (1965).
During the winter of 1962-3, I had, in a heated room, a box cage
containing four small estrildines and a cock E. chinensis. One of the
estrildines a cock L. senegala was frequently seen to preen the quail,
sometimes perching on his back while preening the head. The quail sat
in a passive " fluffed out " manner, turning his head to facilitate the
firefinch's preening. This pattern was varied by the firefinch standing
near the quail and during these periods the preening was usually mutual.
When a hen quail was added to the " collection " the firefinch-quail
interaction stopped.
I thought this behaviour curious and wrote a letter to the editor of the
Avicultural Magazine, hoping someone might have further information.
No interest was shown and other attempts to find " records " of this
behaviour were unsuccessful. Thinking it an isolated incident, I almost
dismissed it, until I made a number of visits to a Municipal aviary in 1965.
This behaviour was again noted in an outside flight housing about forty
passerines and a single E. chinensis cock. The table shows which species
were seen to clump and mutually preen with the quail. When these visits
were repeated in 1966, a hen quail had been added to the collection and
no further cases of quail-passerine interaction were observed.

12 JEFFREY TROLLOPE--THE PAINTED QUAIL, A BEHAVIOURAL NOTE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999190592592593" page_id="56364290"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
On reading the News and Views column of this Magazine (1966) I
noticed an interesting extract from a letter by Mrs. Grace Wheatley,
who describes what would appear to be clumping and mutual preening
between a hen Yellow-breasted Waxbill and a single E. chinensis cock.
It would seem that the quail also " tit-bitted " the waxbill.
To summarize these notes, it would appear that single E. chinensis cocks
provide a " stimulus " for certain other birds. It would be considered
that the plumage pattern of the cock, which plays an important part in
social interactions (Harrison), could provide this " stimulus " for other
species. However, this could only be valid in the tit-bitting posture,
during locomotion, etc. In the clumped position only the black and
white facial mask of the conspicuous plumage would be fully visual to
other birds. The facial masks of the Harlequin Quail ( Coturnix
delegorguei) and the Rain Quail (C. coromadelica) are similar to E. chinensis
and equally striking. I have kept single cocks of these Coturnix species
with passerines and hemipodes as " test " cases, so far the only interaction
has been a single incident of a cock C. delegorguei tit-bitting a hen
Hemipode.
The possibility that smaller birds clump with cock E. chinensis " because
they are larger " would seem unlikely as the slightly larger Rain Quail and
much larger Harlequin Quail are apparently ignored. Limited informa-
tion available seems to indicate they do not clump with quail " because
they are cold ". The fact that some of the birds clumping with the quail
are paired with conspecifics would seem to have little effect. It would be
interesting to know whether, when a hen quail is added, the normal quail
pair bond is assumed in a passive manner, or, if any aggression on the
quail's part breaks any " alien " relationship.

By Clifford Smith (Denholme, Yorks., England)
When determining the age for breeding, time for settlement, bringing
into condition and matching, the circumstances in which I acquired my
two breeding pairs of Greys should be of some help.
My first Grey was purchased from a well-known pet store in the early
summer of 1962. It was a young bird still not showing the yellow eye
of the adult, but certainly changing from the baby stage of black. Though
sold to me as a pet I, like all aviculturists, thought of breeding when I saw
another Grey in a local pet shop. This bird to me looked like a cock
although none of my literature on Greys helped me with sexing them.
This particular Grey had a bold, fearless look, was certainly darker in
colour, screeched when anyone went near it, and was larger than average
size. I was informed by the pet shop that the bird had been purchased
with the intention of being sold as a pet but the bird's " growling " was
making a sale difficult. The final blow came when the Grey began to
pluck itself, and having visions of a featherless bird, with even less chance
of a sale, the pet shop was pleased to exchange the bird for half a dozen
canaries.
The two Greys were put in adjoining flights and, after a week of head
scratching and perching close to the wire alongside each other, they were
put in the same aviary and both showed their pleasure by whistles and
coos, head scratching and beak rubbing. Within a few weeks the cock,
as it proved to be, had given up plucking and they moulted
out into two lovely birds. A nest-box was introduced in spring, 1964,
and although no attempt was made to nest, the cock was feeding its mate
and I was convinced I had a pair. In spring, 1965, I assumed by the
amount of peat being thrown from the entrance to the box, that the birds
were furnishing a nest. During May mating was observed on several
occasions so when, in the second week of June, the hen was missing for
long periods I hoped the eggs were being produced. As the hen was quite
steady I looked in the nest-box while she was feeding in the shelter.
There I found two eggs. I did not look again for fear of disturbing the
birds. Early in July I heard the unmistakable sound of young birds
being fed and from then onwards the intake of food was gradually
increased.
All went well, until September, with the hen and cock both visiting
the box and feeding, but one morning I found the cock Grey dead in the
shelter and heard no sounds from the nest-box although the hen was still
going in. On investigation I found one fully grown, nearly fully feathered
young dead in the nest. As the cock had shown no sign of illness I pre-
sumed that he had picked up some contaminated food and also passed it
into the chick. Success being so near I obviously had to find another cock.
As luck would have it Mrs. E. Wicks, of St. Leonards, advertised a cock

Grey for sale. After seeing it I was sure it was a cock, although Mrs. Wicks
had proved it, he was a large bird in excellent condition. I bought the
cock and went through the same stages of introduction as before. The
pair seemed to agree and in May, 1966, mating was observed. At the end
of June they began shaping a nest and on 16th July the first egg was laid.
On 30th July, whilst the hen was off, I saw three eggs in the nest-box.
I heard the young being fed in the nest-box on 24th August and the food
supply was increased. This time all went well and two fine young birds
left the nest on the 12th and 14th of November, being approximately
eighty days in the nest-box.
My second two adult birds were bought from a fancier/dealer in 1966,
who assured me they were a true pair. As they had clipped wings and 1
were very wild I assumed they were new imports and did not expect any
chance of breeding until they had settled down. Therefore, when I
bought a similar bird from the same fancier/dealer, also claimed to be a
cock, I did not hesitate to put all three birds together. Within a few days
the latest bird was feeding the bird sold to me as a cock of the pair. I
gave them a separate aviary with a nest-box and within five minutes they
were in it.
Over the next few weeks I hardly ever saw the birds as they were very
wild and dived into the nest-box if anyone approached within thirty yards.
At the end of August I heard the sound of young being fed, but I could
not look into the box due to the birds' nervousness. The end of November
brought a very cold spell, so realizing that the young must now be fully
feathered I decided to look into the nest-box knowing the adults would
not encourage the chicks to leave the nest.
I found one fully feathered chick which I took from the nest and had no
trouble in hand-rearing it to independence.
At the time of writing, September, 1967, the first pair again have two
youngsters five weeks old, and the wild pair have two young ready for
leaving the nest. Both pairs of birds are housed in flights 10 feet long by
5 feet wide by 6 feet high. They have a shelter 5 feet wide by 3 feet deep
in the adjoining bird room. The nest-boxes are grandfather clock type
6 feet high by 12 inches by 10 inches with a 4 inch entrance hole about
9 inches from the top. The boxes are filled with chopped turves and peat
moss to about 18 inches down from the hole and a wire ladder fixed down
the inside. The nest-boxes are in the outside flight facing north and
with no overhead cover.
The birds were fed on sunflower, canary, millet, hemp, safflower, wheat,
oats and peanuts.
When the young were being reared all the seed was soaked and this was
taken in preference to the dry seed. At least a bucketful of green food
was taken each day by the birds and this consisted of chickweed and
groundsel. Safflower and hemp seemed to be favourite so it was given
in abundance. Apple seemed to be ignored once the chicks had hatched,

and so to a smaller extent were the peanuts.
All the incubating was done by the hen, the cock feeding the hen
either at the nest-box entrance or in the flight. Within a week of the eggs
hatching the cock was entering the box and feeding the young. After
about four weeks both the hen and the cock were continually in and out
of the box.
The hen broods the chicks at night for at least two months after hatching.
When the young leave the nest they are almost identical in appearance to
the parents except that the eyes are entirely black, the tail feathers are not
as vivid a red as the adults and the general appearance is a darker but
softer grey than the adults. Within fourteen days the young were picking
up seed.
As my aviaries are in a very exposed and bleak part of the country with
no trees for shelter, and as the Greys seem to be late nesters by length of
time spent in the nest-box, I shall take the young away from the parents
when they are ready to leave the nest, as I do not think Greys are as hardy
as Australian parrakeets.
This is confirmed by the way in which the adults always sleep in the
shelter at the first sign of any bad weather whereas the cockatoos and
parrakeets often sleep out on really bad nights.
If any members are interested in Greys and seeing the pairs would help
them in sexing, I should be pleased to welcome them.

THE BREEDING OF A YOUNG UMBRELLA

The pair was received three years ago from Gerald Kirkham, who I
believe had imported them direct from abroad and had had them for a
year or two.
Unlike most cockatoos, which nearly always get used to people, this
pair have remained wild and shy and dive into their barrel on the approach
of myself or the keepers who they know can enter their aviary.
The sexes are alike except for the eye-colour---jet black in the cock, dark
brown in the hen. This is quite distinct even at a distance of several
yards.
The first year we had them at the Tropical Bird Gardens they were
housed away from the public in a 20 foot flight and given a barrel in
which they spent a lot of time like lovebirds, but no attempt was made to
breed.

D. H. S. RISDON--BREEDING A YOUNG UMBRELLA COCKATOO
The second year they were moved into a public aviary which they
shared with two Sulphur-Crested Cockatoos. As we were short of room
at the time they were not given an opportunity to breed.
This the third year we removed the Sulphur-Crests and gave them
the aviary to themselves. The size of this is approximately 14 feet long,
7 feet wide, and 8 feet high. It is constructed entirely of 2 inch weld
mesh on a framework of tubular steel. The back, ends, and part of the
roof at each end are boarded over to give shelter.
This spring (1967) the pair were given a wooden barrel about 16 inches
in diameter and 20 inches tall with a hole cut in one side near the top.
This was filled to about a quarter of its depth with the usual mixture of
rotten wood and peat and fixed as high as possible in one corner at the back
of the aviary. They took to the barrel almost at once, but nothing much
was thought of this as they had done it before and we thought they were
just using it as a refuge.
However, at the end of June it was noticed that only one bird appeared
at a time during the day so, on 7th July my assistant, Michael Curzon,
decided to investigate and reported that there was an egg in the barrel.
It was difficult to see what was going on because immediately one entered
the aviary both birds dived into the barrel, so times of laying and hatching
are only approximate. On 30th July sounds of a young one being fed
were heard. These were much the same as those made by young Cocka-
tiels or Galahs being fed.
From time to time during the following weeks feeding noises were
heard indicating that all was well and, on one occasion, Michael Curzon
managed to have a peep and saw a large well-feathered chick at the bottom
of the barrel. The baby left the nest on 1st October fully feathered and
identical to its parents except for being a bit smaller. It is steadier than
they are and does not mind being looked at.
The interesting thing is that, although the pair are so nervous, they
bred in an aviary which is on public exhibition and has had a stream of
hundreds of visitors passing it daily throughout the summer.
In addition to the usual seed mixture of sunflower, peanuts, and maize,
the food throughout the rearing period was a mixture of soaked bread and
chopped-up fruit in the morning and brown bread liberally smeared with
butter sprinkled with " Vitmin " in the evening. Very little green-
food was taken and strangely cuttlefish bone was ignored.
As described above, the Umbrella Cockatoo (Kakatoe alba) has been
bred at The Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode. It is believed this may be a
first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

The King Vulture which was born here on 28th July, 1966, is,
fortunately, still in good health and is growing normally and well. He
has completely lost his baby-feathers, and now he is totally anthracite
black. Even his head is black and also the " caruncola ". On the back
he has some white feathers and the legs are dark grey.
This is the second King Vulture to be born at the Zoo from the same
pair. The first one was born on 26th February, 1966, but only lived
twenty days. He was never found, dead or alive. We think that it was
killed and taken away by rats.
In one of the two accompanying illustrations of the young King
Vulture the mother is also shown. Unfortunately we lost her through a
kind of intestine cancer, when the young one was only four and a half
months old.

BREEDING OF THE JAVAN FISH-OWL AT THE

In May, 1945, a Javan (or Malayan) Fish-Owl was received in Regent's
Park from the late Mr. Spedan Lewis's collection at Leckford. Its age
at the time of arrival was not known, but it would presumably have been
added to the Leckford collection at some time before the outbreak of war
in 1939, so that it may be more than thirty years of age now. In 1954
Dr. Searle presented us with another of the same species and after some
unsuccessful nestings and egg-laying difficulties earlier, one chick was
hatched during February, 1967, but it did not survive. The parents
nested again and one chick, now indistinguishable from the parents but
for the ring that it wears, was reared.
The nest was made in a thick layer of peat moss that covers the aviary
shelter floor and was, of course, just a scraped out hollow ; the nest was
concealed from public view by a sheet of hardboard, so it would have
been impossible, without causing disturbance, to observe what went on
behind the scenes.
It is not known how many eggs were laid, but while Stuart Baker reports
clutches of two and three, Jackson says that in west Sumatra a single egg is
the normal clutch ; a report on a nest in north Tenasserim also speaks of a
single egg and so does Kuroda in " Birds of the Island of Java ". The
closely related Ceylon Fish-Owl ( K . zeylonensis) is said by Whistler to lay

the year and it was only in 1967 that a second attempt at a more favourable
season was made. The natural foods are said to be small mammals, birds,
fish, frogs, crustaceans and large water-bugs. Our birds have been
offered fish at times, but have refused it : their diet consists of raw lean
meat, rats, mice and day-old chicks.

(Platycercus zonarius macgillimayi)
By J. J. Yealland
Among a collection of mammals and birds presented to the Society
early in 1963 by Sir Edward Hallstrom, Taronga Park, Adelaide Zoo and
the Tasmanian Protection Board (as reported in the Avi cultural
Magazine, Vol. lxix, pp. 170, 171) was a pair of Cloncurry Parrakeets
which, after being exhibited at Whipsnade for that summer, came to
Regent's Park together with some of the other mammals and birds. At
first it seemed that the birds were both females, for there was no observed
evidence of courtship display and no sign of nesting in either 1964 or 1965,
but in 1966 two eggs were laid, the mother becoming egg-bound with the
second. In the summer of 1967 nesting again took place in a box hung
high up in the aviary shelter and a single chick was hatched and success-
fully reared. It appears to be a male and when it left the nest its chance of
survival seemed poor, for it could not fly and its plumage had been plucked
by one or both parents. However, they cared for it and did no further
damage to the plumage so that in due course it became quite presentable
and a strong flyer. It is now quite independent and is separated from the
parents.
In addition to the seed mixture and fruit, the birds are given lettuce,
sprouted wheat and, while they were rearing the chick, some watercress,
green peas in the pod when available, sometimes green lucerne and some
bread soaked in the Complan mixture that is fed to the Lorikeets. The
male sometimes ate a little of the grass growing in the flight and, of course,
cuttle-fish " bone " and limestone grit are always available to them. I
think it correct to say that the only previous importation of the Cloncurry
Parrakeet into this country was that of a pair received in 1939 by the late
Duke of Bedford, but presumably they died in the course of the wartime
period. This parrakeet is now considered to be conspecific with, among
other races, the Barnard's, Bauer's and Yellow-naped (Twenty-eight) and
though in general appearance seems nearest to the Barnard's. Dr. Lendon
(Avicultural Magazine, 1939, pp. 375-378) said that he thought it
possibly nearer to the Port Lincoln (Bauer's).

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
Although we in Western Europe tend to worry about the possibility of
the extinction of some of our birds as their range and numbers shrink
with the continuing spread of humanity, a general survey of the species
already lost in the world as a whole, suggests that the birds which are
most vulnerable are populations which occupy very limited habitats,
such as those on small islands, or in limited areas of forest which are
islands in otherwise open country. In such cases the habitat can be
rapidly destroyed or drastically reduced and the birds have no alternative
place into which to move. Although such species may be relatively
plentiful in the places where they are found, a change in surroundings or a
concerted attack upon them can quickly reduce them beyond the point
of no return ; and there are no small remnants, concealed in more in-
accessible places, which can survive.
A bird which has aroused some anxiety in recent times is Leucopsar
rothschildi , variously known as Rothschild's Mynah, Rothschild's Starling
and Rothschild's Grackle. The last name is the one most frequently
used by aviculturists, but since this is a mynah, and since the other
grackles are a group of the American troupials (Icteridae) the first name
seems preferable. This species is limited to a small area on the northern
coast of the Island of Bali in Indonesia. Bali is well known as a rather
small island as heavily populated as Britain or Japan. Its natural resources
are sorely strained, but a few years ago it was said that Rothschild's
Mynah, although very restricted in its distribution, was present in fair
numbers. About six or seven years ago, however, there were sudden
large importations of this species into Europe where hitherto it had been
very rare. One British dealer was said to have had a consignment of
fifty. In view of the political situation in Indonesia it was impossible to
find out what was happening, but some alarm was felt for the safety of the
species.
Dr. Lee-Talbot who visited the island in 1964 commented that the
forest which afforded nesting sites for the species was being felled and
that he saw few birds in the wilds and rather more in cages. It is not
possible to tell whether the exports were due to large numbers being
present, or to the birds being more concentrated in distribution and more
easily caught as their habitat was being destroyed. There have been
some efforts to preserve the species by the Indonesians. The bird is now
on the protected list and a recently created reserve in the area is said to
have a population of it, but there is no recent information on its status.
It would not be difficult for such a species to become extinct. The
Mascarene Islands of the Indian Ocean had three such mynahs which
were lost during historic times. One of these, the Crested Bourbon

Starling (Fregilupus varius) with a slender decurved bill and flattened
crest giving it a hoopoe-like appearance, was common on one of the
islands and was kept in cages by early settlers who stated that it " ate
anything " but the nesting habitat was steadily destroyed by human
settlement and the bird is now known only by a few skins and skeletons
in museums.
In view of the doubts about the future of Rothschild's Mynah it seems
sensible to suggest that we should attempt to conserve and perpetuate the
population now in the hands of aviculturists, so that if it should be dis-
covered that the wild population is disappearing then there will still be an
aviary population of this species to turn to. When this matter was raised
in the Council of the Avicultural Society it was suggested that no one had
succeeded in maintaining a viable population of any " softbill " under
aviary conditions. We recognise the difficulties involved, but the estab-
lishment of aviary populations of any species involves difficulties. Usually
there is evidence after a few years have passed that fertility is decreasing.
This has occurred in ornamental pheasants, and there is evidence of it
in the latest data on the breeding of the Ne-ne Goose, and it is said to be
appearing in populations of Australian parrakeets in aviaries. Another
difficulty usually arises if a rare species does breed well in captivity, since
both Zoos and private aviculturists tend to become bored with their
success and give the birds less opportunity to breed, apparently on the
assumption that they can always begin if the necessity arises ; but it is far
more likely that the species will be found to have disappeared without
its loss having been noted. It is a sobering thought that at one time both
Zoos and private aviculturists were breeding the Passenger Pigeon and
thinking little of it. In spite of the apparent difficulties, a co-ordinated
effort to maintain captive populations of some species seems worthwhile,
and we would ask all those fortunate enough to possess Rothschild's
Mynah to co-operate in this.
To begin with we must compile a register of the birds and need to know
the location of various pairs and individuals, what success has been
experienced in the breeding of them, and what losses ; and also what
conditions seem to be most conducive to successful breeding.
Mr. W. R. Partridge, who owns several pairs of this species, has agreed
to assemble and collate this information, and we would begin by appealing
for those who have these birds, or who know friends who possess them
and are unlikely to read this, to send in the information to Mr. W. R.
Partridge at Lower Haselor, near Evesham, Worcestershire.
At this stage we would like to know the number of birds of this species
now in the hands of any particular aviculturist ; the number bred or lost
during the past season ; and also whether the birds will be given the
opportunity to breed in the coming year.

During the Spring of 1967 two pairs of the Purple or Yellow-legged
Honey creeper were received from the Trinidad Zoo and they were,
presumably, of the race longirostris that occurs on that island. They were
put into the Tropical House where another of the same species already
lived. This house is some 45 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 11 feet to
the roof of nylon netting ; it is planted with a variety of tropical plants
except for a paved central area where people walk through.
The pair of honeycreepers nested in a small wicker basket, with a side
entrance, hung high up near the roof : it is not known how many eggs
were laid, but one chick was reared and when it left the nest a dried egg
measuring 17 mm. by 13 mm. was found in the nest. The ground colour
of the shell was a very pale pinkish-buff and it was profusely covered with
spots and blotches of pale chestnut-buff, more heavily marked at the larger
end.
The favourite food taken to the chick by its parents was house flies :
other foods provided in this house are a liquid food based on Complan
with liver extract by day, sugar and water with the liver extract and vitamin
compound from late afternoon until early morning, fruit flies, mealworms,
substitute insectile mixture and fruit. When first out of the nest the
chick was the subject of some curiosity on the part of the other birds,
but it quickly gained assurance and for some time now has been flying
strongly and feeding itself. On leaving the nest the chick could easily be
distinguished from its mother by, of course, its shorter beak ; it also had
conspicuous yellow skin at the gape and a greyish throat.
The Red-legged, Blue or Yellow-winged Honeycreeper or Sugarbird
(C. cyaneus ) has been bred in this country on more than one occasion,
but I believe that this is the first of C. caeruleus to be bred here.

CHARLES LECK--NOTES ON THE PURPLE HONEYCREEPER
NOTES ON THE PURPLE HONEYCREEPER
AS A CAGE BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98538535" page_id="56364302"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
By Charles Leck (Ithaca, N.Y., U.S.A.)
Each year, as a student living in a rented room, I have only a small space
for cage birds. However, certain birds can do well in a minimum area,
and such birds are ideal for persons who have limited facilities. Thus,
last fall I successfully raised two broods of Zebra Finches in a small cage on
my bookshelf. This species is, of course, well known for its general hardy
nature and ease of breeding. Nevertheless, there are probably many other
species which will also quickly adapt to such restricted space, and which
will make enjoyable pets for the amateur aviculturist or student of avian
behaviour. In the following account, it will be seen that the Purple
Honeycreeper (Cyanerpes caeruleus ) is one such species.
The Honeycreepers (family Coerebidae), which are also known as Sugar-
birds, are fairly small, often blue or green, and neo-tropical. The Purple
Honeycreeper is, for example, confined to the countries of northern South
America. In the wild, their food would include nectar and soft fruits, as
well as small insects. In fact, I have observed Honeycreepers feeding on
berries in Costa Rica.
My bird, an attractive male, has been maintained in good health with
such easily available foods as bread and milk, oranges, bananas, and grapes.
In addition, clean water and insect food are supplied regularly. I found
Drosophila fruit flies (obtained from any Genetics Laboratory) a convenient
source of protein for the bird. Fortunately, the fruit, by attracting the
flies, generally restricts them to the cage, where they can be easily captured
by the Honeycreeper. Thus, the insect food, in addition to being valuable
from a nutritional point of view, also evokes a variety of interesting
behaviour patterns from the Honeycreeper. It will readily catch up to
twenty fruit flies in succession, whether they be in flight or on the fruit.
Each capture is a rapid sequence of events, which includes the approach,
quick snap of the bill, and ingestion. The speed and agility with which the
bird moves during such feeding is most remarkable. And the positions
it uses in stretching out from the perch while catching insects indicate that
its legs are strong and muscular. Indeed, the observation of the feeding
behaviour is a most interesting and enjoyable experience.
The Purple Honeycreeper also " sings " occasionally. I use quotation
marks because singing as such seems to be unknown from Honeycreepers.
Nevertheless, my bird will infrequently give a curious warble which may
last for several seconds, and be repeated several times. In general, the
sound is similar to that of the song of the Purple Finch (Carpodacus
purpureus ) of North America, but softer. Other vocalizations include
high pitched notes that are common to other species in the family.

Finally, it should be mentioned that the Purple Honeycreeper's close
relative, the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird (Cyanerpes cyaneus ), has nested
successfully and raised young indoors, in a small cage, when supplied with
sufficient mealworms. Thus, the Purple Honeycreeper, which in itself
is to be recommended as an interesting small cage bird, is also to be
recommended as a species which can probably be bred in captivity with
a few modest requirements.

Due to the warm and dry summer weather, breeding results in May,
June, July and August, 1967, were very good. Worth mentioning are
thirty-four young Rheas; two of them died, but the others so far are doing
well. After the good results we had last year with the hand-rearing of a
hybrid Pelican (P. rufescens x P. crispus ) we again decided to put an egg
into the incubator. This time, a White Pelican hatched and is now being
hand-reared as his predecessor. In the meantime, he has grown up to
the size of a large duck.
In our Flamingo colony, consisting of seventy-seven specimens, five
European Flamingos hatched in May. One disappeared, however, and
another was killed in a thunderstorm. The remaining three have grown
considerably and are well fed by the adults. The Chilean Flamingos
reared one chick.
The following waterfowl hatched and are likely to be reared: 1 Cuban

It is now over ten years since Mr. L. W, Hill purchased an estate at
Bourton-on-the-Water to fulfill a dream he had had ever since he was a
small boy who lived next door. After having carefully developed the
grounds as a beautiful garden with comfortable quarters for birds Mr.
Hill opened the gardens to the public in 1958 as " Birdland "--a title
which he has fully maintained. From the beginning it was his aim to
show the birds to their best advantage and to give them as much freedom
as possible--his pet African Grey Parrot " Juno " flying unconcernedly
among the big trees and coming back to the house as he pleased was
followed by free-flying Macaws. Soon a Trumpeter was walking con-
fidently among the visitors, Pheasants pecked about in the undergrowth
and gradually the number of free-ranging birds was increased until the
impression gained is that the majority of the inhabitants of Birdland are
wandering about at will. Mr. Hill has a great gift for taming birds and |
giving them confidence and it is a revelation to walk round the gardens j
with him and to see the welcome he receives from birds which by nature
are by no means trustful.
Gradually more enclosures and aviaries were constructed, pools and
streams made, and the number and variety of species of birds increased.
But all the development was motivated by the fundamental idea of pro-
viding the best possible setting for the birds and this was achieved with
that sense of beauty which in Mr. Hill is innate. Birdland has now be-
come world-famous and is a tangible example of dedication and happy
co-operation, for the success is due to the fact that Mr. Hill has been
supported and helped by Mrs. Hill and their family, each taking a part
in the management and running of the gardens.
Mr. Hill has always made a point of using the gardens as a means of
giving pleasure to those who are not so fortunate. Numerous parties of
handicapped children have been entertained and from the beginning
old-age pensioners were admitted free ; as a result they felt a personal
pride in the gardens and constituted themselves honorary wardens,
keeping a sharp eye for anyone who might harm the birds or plants.
Money has been collected for a number of good causes including substantial
amounts for the World Wildlife Fund.

A great landmark in the history of Birdland was the construction in
1965 of a new tropical house, a building of great beauty in which ideal
conditions for tropical birds have been achieved. It is very simple in
design with a convex roof measuring 40 by 60 feet made of Filon glass
fibre reinforced polyester sheeting ; thus there is a minimum loss of heat
while the maximum natural light into the building is obtained. The
material, however, is sufficiently opaque to obviate the birds dashing
themselves against it ; it is also tough and weatherproof. The roof is
supported by an unobtrusive light aluminium frame which the birds use
for perching purposes. The main hall is well planted with trees, shrubs
and flowering plants, a stream and waterfall ensure humidity and the whole
forms a perfect setting for the tropical birds, all of which are free-flying.
In the outer hall are the " Jewel enclosures " housing several species of
beautiful Humming Birds ; these enclosures are based on the design of the
late Captain de Quincey, that great expert in the keeping of Humming
Birds.
Mr. Hill supplied the following notes on his birds in July, 1967 :
" The new tropical house is now really settling down and is approaching
the end of its second year. Spur-winged Plover are nesting and are now
sitting on eggs, but the most pleasing thing of all is that within a few
weeks of arrival the Snowy-headed Robin Chats ( Cossypha niveicapilla )
built a nest and reared one youngster, but unfortunately it had a deformed
beak and leg. Since then they have built two more nests and have now
commenced a fourth, having reared three young in all. The nesting
habits seem to be similar to those of the White-browed Robin Chats which
now have their fourth nest with two strong youngsters, five days old. I
would say that the only marked thing I have noticed is that the Snowy-
headed are far more shy that the White-browed for the latter nested
within a foot of the door jamb to my house entrance. Most of the nests
are not more than 5 feet from the ground, one exception being the first
which was made in a large hanging basket of Medinilla, but the youngsters
plummeted down on to the pathway to their deaths. It took not more
than five days to build the nest of wet, rough vegetation lined with dry,
fine hair and sisal type strands from the stems of Banana trees. The two
eggs are a rich brown coffee-bean colour, very beautiful with a lovely polish.
The White-browed Robin Chats successfully reared nine youngsters.
Unfortunately the eggs of the Humming Birds were clear and the
Violet-backed Tanagers deserted fertile eggs after six days.
The following species inhabit this house : Blue-throated Sylph

brevirostris), Blue-grey Tanager ( Thraupis virens nesophila).
In the tropical house at the main entrance, which measures 60 by
16 feet the Bleeding-heart Pigeons ( Gallicolumba luzonica) reared three
youngsters in their three broods. Other birds in this house are the
Black-headed Sugar Bird ( Chlorophanes spiza), Grey-headed Kingfisher
( Halcyon leucocephala ), Green-crowned, Brilliant or Amethyst Flying
Dolphin ( Heliodoxa jacula ), White-breasted Waterhen ( Amaurornis
phoenicurus) and Roulroul Partridge ( Rollulus roulroul).
The hen Giant Hornbill was in a nest from 7th March to 3rd May but
nothing materialized. In the large aviary the Bower Bird started building
a bower on 25th March and completed it in ten days, but repairs it daily
and thickens it, decorating it every morning with approximately five pieces
of small green leaves off clover, with grass.
This bird has a special liking for flies, large house-flies, moths, etc.
I purchased a special moth-trap and collected large quantities of moths,
carefully culling them and releasing the rare species and then feeding the
residue to the Chats. The Minivets also enjoyed them. I got quite
friendly with two frogs which, when I emptied my trap just before dawn,
were always waiting for the ones which dropped through the night ; these
two were quite content, their backs to the sodium light, picking off any
strays.
In the Penguin enclosure the King Penguin has one young and one
bird is sitting ; unfortunately one pair had their egg stolen five days
before it was due to hatch. Humboldt's and Jackass Penguins are sitting.
The Spreo Starlings have two lovely youngsters, Swainson's Lorikeets
have one pair of youngsters and are now sitting again ; Purple-capped
Lories, which have managed to raise a brood each year for the past three
years, are sitting and the Black-capped Lory is also sitting. The Eclectus
Parrot is sitting and the Hahn's Macaws have a nest full of youngsters
again ".
In July, 1967, yet another innovation was introduced to Birdland
with the establishment of a Lecture Hall which was formally opened by
Peter Scott in the presence of leading aviculturists and naturalists from
all over the British Isles. A mural of a view in the neighbourhood of
Bourton-on-the-Water depicting a flight of duck rising over a stream,
executed by Peter Scott, was unveiled by Jean Delacour on the same
occasion and both paid tribute to the achievements of Mr. Hill and his
family. The hall will be used for meetings and films on natural history
will be shown, and thus the educational value of Birdland will be even more
enhanced.

The pair of Neorhynchus peruvianas about which Mr. Restall wrote in
the May/June Avicultural Magazine were received from him during
October and they are the first to be exhibited here. They appear to be
the Ecuadorian race, dewonis , also known as the Ecuadorian Neorhynchus
or Verreaux's Brown Grosbeak.
Dr. K. C. Searle has presented four Green-winged Doves, two Chinese
Starlings and six Chinese Crested Mynas (Acridotheres c. cristatellus), and
other presentations include a Gannet, a Goshawk, a Red-headed Kestrel
or Merlin, a Ruff and a pair of Petz's Conures. Other noteworthy arrivals
include six Black-footed Penguins, two Straw-necked Ibises, two Harle-
quin Quail, two Tasmanian Waterhens, two Hyacinthine Macaws, a
Long-tailed or Streamer-tailed Humming Bird and a Pied Crow. During
the autumn another Sacred Ibis, a Speckled Pigeon and a Crested Pigeon
have been bred in the Gardens.
A Yellow-billed Oxpecker received in November, 1955, has died.

During the 1914-1918 War it was customary for troops stationed at
Bulford, Wiltshire, to carve their regimental badges in a chalk hillside of
Salisbury Plain. New Zealand troops carved a Kiwi, with the letters
N.Z., which with the passing of time had become overgrown. As a
parting gesture before leaving Kiwi Barracks for Gibraltar the 1st Bn.
Royal Ulster Rifles renovated the carving.

One would not have thought it necessary to draw attention to the fact
that the Society's waterfowl rings are intended for use on waterfowl, and
on waterfowl only. A ring just recovered was worn by a (? Collared)
Turtle Dove ! It is, of course, just possible that the ring was taken off a
dead bird by someone and placed on the dove. But we did have a very
similar occurrence some years ago--same suspected ringer, same recovery
area.

season was rather poor where the larger species of parrakeets were con-

of Yellow-fronted Kakarikis had nests of seven and seven, and now (mid-

however, that from a second pair of Yellow-fronted and from three pairs

Longevity. The name of the premises now occupied by the Bombay
Natural History Society is " Hornbill House ". This name pleasingly
perpetuates the memory of a Great Indian Hornbill. " William " lived
in a large cage in offices formerly occupied by the B.N.H.S. and was the
pet and mascot of the staff for twenty-six years. He " died through
misadventure by overeating the wire of his cage " William " is now
exhibited as a mounted specimen in the hornbill group in the bird gallery
of the Prince of Wales Museum.
Before the very severe winter of 1962-63, Kent Brook, which adjoins
our property, was locally well known as a haunt of Kingfishers. Fortun-
ately they have recovered to such an extent that we have an occasional
visitor to one of our three ponds. The pleasure of seeing them is perhaps
tempered by the knowledge that they are taking some of the smaller fish,
probably up to about three inches. I do not know how large a fish a King-
fisher can take but Witherby records a young Pike of nearly five inches.

Guy Detry, Wavre, Belgium, writes: " In late August one of my two
pairs of Malachite Kingfishers ( Corythornis cristata) tunnelled in a bank
erected in my outside aviary. Six eggs were laid and incubated during
five weeks. But, probably due to the fact that the male was not in perfect
breeding condition, none of them proved to be fertile. I had two wonder-
ful Cameroon Shining-blue Kingfishers ( Alcedo quadribrachys guentheri ),
purely fish-eaters. I kept them in tip-top condition for more than a year,
but I had eventually to dispose of them (they went to the Antwerp Zoo),

A peg-leg crane. A modern equivalent to the Balearian Crane with
" a wooden or boxen leg and thigh " formerly in St. James's Park (1967 :

A. W. Bowden, Haverhill, has recently bred the Pagoda Myna ( Temenu -
chus pagodarum). One young one was successfully reared in the first
nest ; but in the second the three young had to be destroyed after leaving
the nest as they were severely affected by rickets.
Breeding records are few. The Society's Medal was awarded to the
Rev. C. D. Farrar in 1901, three young being reared. As this breeder was
successful with Malabar, Andaman and Pagoda in little over a year his
results were by some just a little suspect. But as printed the records seem
definite enough. Two young were reared at the London Zoo in 1923.
Three young were fully reared with J. H. Gurney, in 1931 ; two were
still alive when the collection was dispersed in 1934.

" I have also reared nineteen Hooded and five Brown's Parrots. I

The 89 th Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society of South
Australia records that the number of bird species bred at the Adelaide
Zoo during the 1966-67 season was not as many as in the previous year.
One hundred and twenty-nine birds of forty-four species and varieties were
bred, including three Razor-billed Curassows, two Southern Stone
Curlews, two Nicobar Pigeons, and one Red-tailed Black Cockatoo.
The standard and variety of exhibits were well maintained and a good
selection, particularly of Australian species, was on display. The variety
of exotic species that can be exhibited is, however, restricted by the limita-
tions imposed by the Australian quarantine regulations--these regulations
forbid the importation of birds into Australia from any country except
New Zealand.
The Report mentions two notable events : " For the first time in twenty
years six Brush-Turkeys were bred naturally in a mound and, thanks to
the State Department of Fauna Conservation who gave us permission to
collect some eggs, three young Mallee-Fowls were successfully hatched in
an artificial incubator and reared

CAGE AND AVIARY BIRDS. By D. H. S. Risdon. Faber &amp; Faber,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991657925" page_id="56364316"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
London, 1967. Price 285.
One's first impression on seeing this book is that it is "just another
run-of-the mill " book on bird-keeping for beginners. In a sense this is
so, but it is decidedly better than most of its kind, or at least than most of
those I have seen. A main reason for this is, clearly, the author's fondness
for, and interest in, birds which those who have read his various papers in
our Magazine (and for those who haven't I suggest they obtain, at least the
issues of the late forties wherein he gave graphic accounts of his experiences
with various species in really large aviaries) will be well aware of.
Mr. Risdon stresses the fact that cages for pet birds cannot be too big
and that one should buy the largest cage one can afford. In a small and
comprehensive book it is impossible to give the fullest possible information
about the care of every species mentioned but more specific and detailed
directions are given than in most similar books.
The author states that he has made no attempt at scientific grouping,
but he has at least given us the scientific names. I think that even in
a book for beginners it would not have been flirting too dangerously with
Science to have pointed out that the term " finch ", as used in aviculture,
includes both carduelines and estrildines, and that the " whydahs " here
described belong to different groups within the weaver family, one the
parasitic whydahs and the other, a group of long-tailed bishops.
Since I have kept only a minority of the species mentioned I can only
say of the advice as to care and feeding given that it seems to be pretty
sound. I noted for example that, unlike most who give advice to beginners
on feeding the Corvidae, Mr. Risdon, rightly, points out that the Magpie
is best given more animal food than is needed by a Jay. I am, however,
sceptical as to what percentage of Cordon-blues or Blue-breasted Waxbills
will survive the British winter outdoors even with a " snug " shelter
and I certainly think that no one should attempt to winter any waxbills
in an unheated aviary or bird room. There is considerable difference
between Mr. Risdon's advice not to let the temperature of a room in
which Gouldian Finches are kept fall below 7 0 centigrade and that of
Ziegler who, in his monograph on the Gouldian Finch and its care and
breeding, states that Gouldians begin to " vegetate " with cold at 12 0
centigrade, begin to live at 18 0 , become lively at 21 0 and feel really happy
at 24 0 .
The book is illustrated with numerous black and white photographs and
sketches and a coloured frontispiece (repeated on the cover) of the author
with a Red and Yellow Macaw.

HUMMING BIRDS--FLYING JEWELS. By Walter Scheithauer.
Translated from the original German by Gwynne Vevers. Arthur
Barker Ltd., London, 1967. Price 45s.
Buffon very aptly remarks " Of all animated beings, the Humming
Bird is the most elegant in form and the most brilliant in colour. Stones
and metals polished by art are not comparable to this gem of nature ".
It is evidence of the growing interest in these lovely birds to have yet
another book which illustrates in seventy-six coloured photographs
typical examples and also gives information as to how they may be kept
in captivity, which species to choose, and how they may be fed. The
first live Humming Bird to arrive in Europe was a Sparkling Violet-ear
(Colibri coruscans) which was exhibited at the London Zoo in 1905, but
only survived fourteen days. In the past sixty years much has been
learnt about their proper care, which depends primarily on correct
feeding and the author gives an account of his own experience and also
that of European Zoos. He considers that he has solved this problem
of diet and has used the following basic recipe for some months with
great success: 800 gm. water, 121 gm. honey and 38 gm. Nektar-Mill II
(a ready-mixed baby food). With this mixture it was not necessary to
change the food in the evening when the need for food is particularly
great. The habits of the birds are described in detail and methods of
keeping them. Finally there is a section on how to photograph Humming
Birds in flight and the necessary technical equipment. The results are
shown in the coloured illustrations and depict the wonderful variety in
colour and form displayed by these very interesting birds. It may be the
reviewer's prejudice, however, but the colours, striking as they are, fail to
give such an accurate impression of the living bird as paintings by artists
such as Audubon, Gould, and many others.

birds of prey. About iiooo B.C. the climate improved and for some
millenia the country became covered with an open birch forest with a
little pine and the original avifauna was replaced by different species of
birds. Then followed the pine forest period succeeded by the oak mixed
forest period and their avifaunas are identified from remains in the
deposits of human inhabitants. About the middle of the last millenium
B.C. there was a climatic depression and the inhabitants were obliged to
protect their domestic animals in the winter. Human settlements
became more permanent and more land was reclaimed from the forest.
Then followed historical times down to 1750 A.D., but without any
reliable ornithological literature. Since this period the landscape of
Denmark has changed considerably and also its bird fauna.
The 282 species of birds now breeding in Denmark are allotted to a
number of faunal types based on ecological and zoogeographical zonation.
This total for various reasons is reduced by fourteen, leaving 268 species
most of which are known to breed or to have bred in the country. These
are classified into six main geographical divisions with sixteen sub-
divisions; there is also a list of species dependent on cultivated areas.
The list of Danish birds throughout the ages includes notes on the
evolution of Danish ornithology from the middle of the 18th century,
the first known contributors being E. Pontoppidan (1698-1764) and
M. T. Briinnich (1737-1827) and especially J. D. Petersen (1717-1787).
Finally, there is a systematic list of species of birds included in the
material with notes on their occurrence and the dates they were first
known in Denmark.

FIRST BREEDING OF MEYER'S PARROT
(Poicethalus meyeri)
I read with great interest the article by Mr. Kenneth W. Greenway on page 195

<bodyText confidence="0.985281411764706" page_id="56364318"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
of the Nov./Dec. issue of our Magazine.
I am sorry to disappoint Mr. Greenway, but I must tell you that after two
unsuccessful attempts in previous years (in the first year, 1964, the eggs were
infertile and in the second year, the two young died before maturity) I bred to
maturity in 1966 three young Meyers which I still have.
I bred three more from the same pair early in 1967 and I now have two in the
nest--my pair were double brooded that year.
As a matter of interest, our mutual friend, Mr. Raymond Sawyer, visited my
aviaries during the early part of last summer and saw the three young 1966 Meyers
flying with their parents.
He suggested it might be a " first breeding " but I replied that I was definitely
under the impression (and I still am) that a " first breeding " of Meyer's was
reported a few years ago either in the Avicultural Magazine or in the Foreign
Birds League Magazine.
I am sure Mr. Raymond Sawyer will recall his visit. I mentioned to Mr. Sawyer
then that I thought the hen was going to nest again and that I intended to take
away the 1966 youngsters.

At the moment I am the proud possessor of ten Meyer's, viz., my adult pair,
three 1966 birds (one cock and two hens) which are flying in a small aviary by
themselves, two 1967 youngsters (believed one cock and one hen) flying with their
parents, a third, believed a cock, of the same hatch in my bird room which I am
trying to train for a pet, and two further young in the nest. I looked at the latter
this morning (Dec. 16th) and they are fully feathered and will be out of the nest-box
at any moment. In point of fact, there were three, but during the recent snow-
storm about ten days ago, I found the third lying in the snow having died from cold
and exposure.
I had one other interesting breeding this season, namely a Redrump X Many
Coloured. As I had failed for two years to obtain a mate for my hen Many Coloured
and she took a fancy to a cock Redrump in the next aviary I put them together and
they went to nest quite quickly.
Four eggs were laid but only two hatched and in point of fact, two young hybrids
were in the nest-box when Mr. Raymond Sawyer visited me and I took them out
and showed them to him although, of course, they were only partly fledged. Both
reached maturity and the hen looked just like a Redrump but the cock bird has
the distinct characteristics of both parents. The hen died during the recent storm
but I still have the cock and intend to mate him back to his mother in the spring 1968.
My pair of Roseates completed the hat trick for me having bred to maturity
three youngsters in 1965, three in 1966 and one in 1967 (there were two, but one
died).
I understand that hybrids do not qualify for a claim to " first breeding " and
it is for that reason that I have not mentioned the Redrump X Many Coloured
before.

PELICANS

Since the virtual disappearance of the Brown Pelican (Pelicanus occidentalis ) as a
breeding bird along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, we in Louisiana have
been greatly concerned over the loss of our state bird from our area.
It is probably much too late to ascertain which of the many theories, if any of
them, represents the true reason or reasons for the loss of this spectacular bird
from our region. However, we are now interested in the possibility of re-establish-
ment and are trying to locate anyone who has had any success in breeding these
birds in captivity.
We are considering the possibility that locally reared birds might be suitable for
the re-establishment of a breeding colony on the coastal islands.
In order to do anything along this line a great deal of information is necessary
and we would very much appreciate learning of anyone who has had any experience
at all in breeding or keeping pelicans.
We would be very grateful indeed if any individuals or institutions in England
or on the continent who might have had some success in keeping or rearing pelicans
would send us information.

The breeding and successful rearing of Colibri coruscans by Mrs. K. M. Scamell
is one of the true pinnacles in British avicultural achievement, and I am sure that
the council of the Avicultural Society, on behalf of the members, will recognize it as
such.
Mrs. Scamell's ability to breed insectivorous, fruit, and nectar feeding species
marks her as an outstanding aviculturist by any standards.
In this country the near success of the late Captain R. S. de Quincey with
Trochilus polytmus, and Mrs. ScamelPs complete success with Colibri coruscans ,
both occurred in heated glass houses with access to outside flights. It is not
likely that the more varied insect fare available and the lack of competition from
other species in the same flights brought the ultimate success, rather than the
reliance on a particular artificial nectar?
Further to this, do we, as aviculturists, rely too much upon the so-called complete
foods, maggots, mealworms, seed mixtures, vitamin, and trace-elements preparations
that are available commercially ?
With these aids we can keep large collections, but do we not cut the percentage of
our breeding achievements by taking the easy path ?

NUTRITION OF NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999506111111111" page_id="56364320"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
In view of Mr. Hastings' slightly misleading comments on nutrition in the
May-June number, 1967, of the Magazine and elsewhere, it seems advisable to
point out one or two facts of basic nutrition in order to balance the picture. Firstly,
birds need a source of food to build and maintain body structure, and find this in
protein. The most readily available source of protein is animals and small
organisms, and most birds utilize insects or similar creatures to feed the young at
a period when growth is occurring, although they themselves may normally eat
other things ; and will take small quantities of protein in the form of live
food, soft foods, or seeds to maintain themselves and supply their own needs.
The other principal need is for a source of energy in order to maintain activity
and this is supplied either directly by sugars in some form, or by more complex
compounds such as starches which are broken down into sugars during digestion.
Sugar is, in fact, the source of energy for them all.
In addition vitamins are needed. These do not nourish the bird directly but
ensure correct bodily functioning, and are normally only needed in minute quanti-
ties, often mere traces. Minerals of various kinds are also needed in varying
quantities, again often as mere traces ; and with both vitamins and minerals an
excess may be as harmful as a deficiency.

A nectar-feeding bird lives mainly on sugar, and the type of sugar used must
necessarily be a matter for experiment. The only obvious objection to cane sugar
is that it is one of the more complex sugar molecules and slightly more digestion is
needed in order to break it down for absorption. This will apply equally to white
sugar, brown sugar, syrup and molasses. The fulminations by late 19th and early
20th century physicians against white sugar, which Mr. Hastings has at times
quoted, were based on the fact that the poor of the period relied for nourishment
upon white sugar and white flour. Their diet therefore lacked sufficient vitamins
and minerals. In circumstances where both vitamins and minerals are added to a
diet such comments cease to be valid.
Protein in some form is, of course, also necessary for nectar-feeders ; and large
quantities will be necessary when young are being reared. Ultimately the real
test for any diet is the results which it yields in terms of the life-span of the bird
and its ability to breed ; although we must remember that other factors will also
affect these results where captive birds are concerned.

NUTRITION OF HUMMING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995930391304348" page_id="56364321"  page_num="37" year="" vol="">
I trust you will give me some space in the Magazine to make a rather belated
reply to Mrs. Scamell's comments on my letter on the nutrition of Humming
Birds which appeared in the May/June issue, 1967. First I would ask Mrs.
Scamell two questions: Where did she obtain her Humming Birds, as she says for
17 years, and why did she not exhibit them before 1962, being one of the leading
exhibitors and when any Humming Bird was a winner ? Secondly, if she had a
breeding pair of these birds in 1964, why did she buy a hen (my selection) from me
in the fall of 1965 ? I suspect that it is the hen she purchased from me that she
bred from.
The articles that appeared in Cage and Aviary Birds proved nothing other than
the ignorance of the writers of the subject in question, nutrition and vitamins.
Mrs. Scamell in her article in the July/August issue, states that her food contains
vitamins A, D (by yeast) where in fact the former are fat-soluble and yeast contains
only the Vitamin B group which are water-soluble.
Let us examine in detail the food recommended, the main ingredient being white
sugar, which the great scientist who discovered Insulin, Dr. F. G. Banting, called
" The scourge of civilisation To produce white sugar, which is pure carbo-
hydrates, the cane is crushed, the first of which is like squelchy mud ; this is
processed and processed until we get, on the one hand white crystals of sugar, on
the other, a black thick
syrupy mixture called molasses.
I now give the analysis
of both, side by side:

The above scientific information substantiates my statement that sugar has
" no food value " in the nutritional sense and supplies energy only. Now to this !
Mrs. Scamell adds one quarter of an ounce of Gerval, the analysis given on the
container as follows: protein, by Soya bean, 65 %, Carbohydrates (by difference), ,
22-45%, Ash 6-6%, moisture 5%, Fiber o-6% and Fat 0-24%, so taking out the
Soya, which sinks to the bottom and the carbohydrates (being sugar) this leaves
about 13% of one quarter of an ounce of synthetic vitamins, distributed in pints
of water. Does Mrs. Scamell seriously claim that this concoction comprises a
completely nutritional food for nectar-feeding birds, which cover Humming Birds
to Lories. I maintain that it will not and I am willing to back my statement.
In her own words she says this food is the best she has ever used, and the Hum-
ming Bird she has reared to be as strong as any bird she has. A perfect combination
for a practical test. So I challenge this lady to place her bird with the zoological
department of one of our leading universities with instructions that the bird is fed
solely on her food as given. I will say that the bird will have a short life, and that
post-mortem will almost certainly show a chronic disease of the liver, possibly
with cancerous conditions, or distentions or perforated, with acute inflamation of
the mouth, tongue and gullet and severe dehydration of the body, etc. If Mrs.
Scamell will accept this challenge I am willing to wager #200 (more if she likes)
that I am correct in this statement. Also, to take a further step, with a similar
wager, a similar test with twelve freshly trapped Humming Birds to be equally split
between two separate universities, one lot to be fed on Mrs. Scamell's food and one
lot to be fed on Stimulite Nectar Food, purchased from any food stores; feeding and
symptoms to be strictly recorded daily, and I will maintain that the group fed on
Stimulite will come out of the test best in every way.
To comment further on Mrs. Scammell's claim of the vitamins her food contains
I would like an explanation of how such vitamins can be in this mixture in view
of the comments above. To comment on the breeding, I cannot see any claim
by anyone about the birds being " easy to breed ". The reason is simple; the
keeping of these birds is the " infant " of aviculture. There is no personal
accomplishment in breeding--give the birds, or anything, facilities to breed and
they will follow nature's instincts. This is illustrated by the fact that within a few
months of the late Capt. R. S. de Quincey completing his new tropical bird house,
his Streamer-tail Hummers went to nest and had two babies, which lived for
about thirteen days. Then again, the very first season Mrs. Scamell provides her
birds with similar facilities, an aviary, they at once go to the job. Her success, if
any, in rearing, is obviously not due to the food, but to the fact that the birds have
access to unlimited numbers of fruit flies and similar insects, gnats, etc., drawn to
the aviary by the food and conditions.
P. H. Hastings.

THE HAWK-HEADED PARROT

{Deroptyus accipitrinus)
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent)
The Hawk-headed Parrot was named Psittacus accipitrinus by Linnaeus
in 1758, presumably on account of a fancied hawk-like appearance.
In 1832 Wagler established the monotypic genus Deroptyus , meaning
" neck (and) fan ", in allusion to the erectile ruff.
Peters lists two races: accipitrinus (Linnaeus), tropical northern South
America from eastern Venezuela and the Guianas south to eastern Ecuador
(?) and the north bank of the lower Amazon; and fuscifrons Hellmayr,
south bank of the lower Amazon from the Tapajoz to Para (city) and
probably to Maranhao.
Specimens from Ecuador and Maranhao are larger and apparently
subspecifically distinct. Authorities are, however, divided on this point.
Whereas Bangs and Penard suggest that fuscifrons may be the immature
of accipitrinus , Griscom and Greenway regard them as two very distinct
races. Cory says that fuscifrons is: "Like D. a. accipitrinus (Linn.),
but differs in lacking the coppery or rosy-red patches on the base of the
outer tail feathers and in having the whole forehead and crown uniformly
dusky or only slightly mottled with brownish white. The ground color
of the sides of the head is darker brown ".
One could give English names to the two races by referring to them as
Guiana and Brazilian respectively.
Very little appears to have been written about this parrot in the natural
state, and the little is usually of the most commonplace. We are merely
told that it is less numerous than many other species, it lives in dense
forests, in pairs or more rarely in small companies, nests in holes in trees,
lays two to four white eggs, erects its ruff when angered, etc., etc.
Dr. Emil A. Goeldi is, however, original. He visited the coast region
of South Guyana in 1895, and writes: " Descending the river [Counany]
next morning I was much pleased with a flight of Deroptyus accipitrinus ,
the Collar-Parrot, called 'Anaca ', one of the most aberrant of the New-
World psittacine forms, reminding one of an Australian Cockatoo.
Everything is aberrant in this bird, even its cry, which is a loud Kia-kia-
kia-gui-giii-gui, and different from that of any other neotropical Parrot.
I believe it is the first time that this species has been noted in the South

RALPH C. SMALL--HAND-REARING THE HAWK-HEADED PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998830571428572" page_id="56364340"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
The Hawk-headed Parrot has been known for several hundred years:
Clusius described it under the name Psittacus elegans as early as 1605;
Edwards depicted it in 1751; and Brisson described it as Psittacus varius
indicus from a living bird in the possession of the Marquise de Pompadour,
in 1760. The Zoological Society of London received its first example in
1856, since when it has frequently been represented in the Collection.
The Ruffed Parrot, to give it its alternative and perhaps more appropriate
name (Dorothy Snyder's Red-Fan Parrot can quite reasonably be dis-
regarded) has always been rather rarely imported. Consequently only a
few aviculturists have had the pleasure of possessing even one, let alone a
pair with the attendant possibility of breeding.
The only records of complete success appear to be to the credit of the
Chicago Zoological Park, three single young ones reared in 1965, and one
hand-reared in 1966 (see R. C. Small).

HAND-REARING THE HAWK-HEADED PARROT
(Deroptyus accipitrinus)
By Ralph C. Small (Parrot Keeper, Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield,
Illinois, U.S.A.)

It was decided to remove nest-box because of work being done on the
cages the Hawk-heads were in. On removing nest-box, there was a three
to seven-day-old baby found along with one infertile egg. The decision
was made to hand-feed the baby and hope for the best. This was the
fourth successful nest for this pair. Three babies were raised in 1965.
The baby Hawk-head was placed in a thermostatically controlled box.
The temperature was placed at 95 0 F, and as it grew, the temperature was ,
gradually lowered to 75 0 when pin feathers were completely opened. On
the bottom of the box were used paper towels or paper sanitary handker-
chiefs at first. Later we used sawdust. ,

Feedings were given by spoon. We started with a small demitasse
spoon and worked it up to a tablespoon as it grew bigger. These spoons
were bent in a vice to make a funnel shape at the end of the spoon, so it
was easy to pour the food into the bill. It usually takes one or two
feedings with a spoon before they really take to it. Most important, the
food must be warm at all times. This was done by keeping the food
holder in hot water throughout feeding. The feeding formula we used
was as follows:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9757022">
2 tablespoons raw peanuts J
1 tablespoon dog chow
1 tablespoon rabbit pellets
1 tablespoon mynah pellets
1 tablespoon mixed pablum cereal
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.964070533333333" page_id="56364341"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
\ teaspoon vitamin mineral supplement
J teaspoon Di-calcium.
All of this was placed in a blender and ground into a fine powder and
stored in a can for use. About a tablespoon of this mixture is mixed in a
small container with hot water and then left until it is entirely soaked with
water. This is made into a thin porridge into which is put a few drops
of a very good liquid vitamin. This container we keep in hot water for
the whole feeding to keep it warm.
I have always used a fresh mixture for each feeding. If kept over a
long period of time, it might sour and cause trouble. The formula has
to be wet enough to supply all the moisture needed for all its requirements.
If the crop becomes a little hard to feel, give a little warm water and
squeeze crop gently until it is again quite soft. Do not feed again until
crop is empty.
About every ten days give a little gravel in its food, and if you notice
the baby is taking less food than normal, try a little gravel and it usually
goes back to full feedings.
This has been the best baby I have ever hand-raised. The formula
would hold a full eight hours. As it grew older, the time between feedings
became less. Most babies, the food only holds them two to four hours,
and that means getting up at night for the first few weeks.
The baby grew quite rapidly. At twelve days, could see eye movement
under the skin. Slits were starting to show where eyes should be. At
fourteen days, one eye was partially open, and the second eye opened two
days later. Pin feathers were also starting to open at this time. At
twenty-two days, I noticed that it could see movement. At twenty-eight
days, started holding food in mouth and chewing on it. Also at this time
was when fresh fruit, such as grapes, oranges, apples, carrots, bananas,
and soaked raisins, was given. Sunflower, millet, canary, and raw
peanuts were also started. Raw peanuts the baby still plays with, but

eats very little. In fact, this baby lives almost entirely on fruit. The
parents also live almost entirely on fruit, but they do like peanuts in the shell.
In the baby's water is put a good liquid vitamin and a little Di-calcium.
At thirty days, I noticed it preening its feathers for the first time. At
fifty-four days, it started to fly. This is when our trouble started. It was
quite hard to keep him from trying to roost on the back of a two-year-old
pet Macaw, and it would fly into the middle of three baby Macaws that
we were still hand-feeding. This baby is afraid of nothing.
The parents of this baby are also fearless. The male got out one time
and attacked a male Red and Yellow Macaw that had young. The only
thing that saved the Hawk-headed Parrot was its speed. I think the
Macaw was so surprised that it didn't think of attacking. At the time I
thought it would be one dead male Hawk-headed Parrot.
If ever you have a chance to hand-feed one of these babies, I am sure
it will prove to be a very enjoyable experience. This has been the nicest
of all the parrot-type birds I have hand-raised so far. It has turned out ;
to be a real lovable pet, or should I say pest.

The Festive Tanager is also known as the Blue-headed Tanager and
the Red-necked Tanager. It is found in South-east Brazil and is rarely
imported into the U.K. In the male the upper neck is red which faded
to a duller orange red after the first moult with us. The throat and head
is a brilliant blue. The general body colour is green with the mantle
jet-black and the belly yellowish. The wings and tail have black markings
and a small black area surrounds the beak. The ear-coverts are green !
and a narrow yellow bar is seen at the shoulder. The female is duller
generally and is easily sexed by the mantle which carries a dull black
pattern, whereas the mantle of the male is jet black all over.
In July, 1966, a friend of ours, the well-known aviculturist Dr. Beraut,
of Rio de Janeiro, was paying a visit to this country and presented us with,
among other rare birds, the pair of Festive Tanagers we now have. I am
not sure of the history of this pair but they were very tame and I seem to
recall they had been in Dr. Beraut's aviaries for some time. We accom-
modated the pair in a compartment in our conservatory which is normally
given over to Humming Birds. The compartment had access through a
pop-hole to a newly planted outdoor flight measuring approximately
10 feet in length by 4 feet in width by 7 feet 6 inches high. These Tanagers
and three Manakins among the collection so kindly given us had been fed
in Brazil on a special food preparation plus diced fruit; we have continued
to feed these birds in the same way ever since and they seem to do well

on this diet. Before using this food preparation we had not been too
successful in over-wintering Manakins in garden aviaries with heated
shelters, but this problem seems to have been overcome, at least in two of
the species, the Military Manakin (Ilicura militaris ) and Azara's Long-
tailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata) which now withstand our very
(Variable climate. I give below the food formula as given to us by Dr.
Beraut:
Mix to a stiff paste--
i /3rd very finely minced Ox-heart
, 1 /3rd finely grated carrot
i/3rd cornflour paste.
To this paste which is fed to seven small birds, I add a teaspoonful of
Gevral-Protein Food and some finely cubed Edam cheese and diced
tomato. If desired the cheese and tomato can be fed separately. I
believe Dr. Beraut also adds a few drops of Scotts Emulsion but I dis-
continued this as I thought the contents of the smallest bottle I could buy
were going rancid before it could be used. I feed this food preparation
first thing each morning, removing all other food remains. At about
11 a.m. I provide finely diced fruit (apple, pear and grapes) and in warm
weather any remains of the meat preparation is removed late in the day.
With regard to the heart meat, I buy a pound or so at a time, de-fat and
very finely mince it and divide it into daily portions, wrap each portion
separately in polythene and hold the packets in the deep-freeze compart-
ment (o* F.) until required. Each packet takes less than an hour to
thaw out before mixing with the other ingredients. The cornflour paste
is prepared by pouring say not more than five or six days' requirement of
dry cornflour into a pan, mixing with it sufficient water to make a thick
paste which I bring to the boil, stirring all the time, and cook for about
five minutes when it should be very stiff. This is stored in a domestic
refrigerator and keeps five or six days. The finely grated carrots are
prepared fresh daily.
The Festive Tanagers quickly settled down, spending most of the
daylight hours in the flight searching for insects in the grass and low
shrubs. A half-open fronted nest-box was fixed about 6 feet up in the
flight facing north and a round wicker basket in the shelter compartment.
In the autumn (which would have been spring in S.E. Brazil) quantities
of leaves and grasses were carried into the shelter and though this was
continued for many weeks, no actual nest was built in 1966. Throughout
the winter they were let out in the flight each day unless it was freezing
and the pair were shown at the Foreign Birds League Show at Nottingham
and also at the National at Olympia, being awarded, if I remember rightly,
a first and second in their class.
During late March and April, 1967, the Festive Tanagers again collected
large quantities of leaves, grasses and even cotton wool and laid these
materials on the shelter floor. We partly filled the outside nest-box with

grasses in the hope they would select this as a nesting site, but continued
to shut the birds in their shelter at night as frosts were still occurring and
we were not sure how the pair would stand up to a night frost. Some
interest was at last being shown in the outside box, but on 22nd May a
broken egg was found in the shelter. The egg fragments were whitish
in colour with brown splashes more numerous at the round end. From
this day we ceased to shut them in at night and the birds now began to
build a nest in the box in the flight. On the 29th May there was one egg
in a deeply cupped nest in this box and the material used was entirely
grasses, no leaves could be seen or felt.
There was a second egg the next day. I did not check on the 31st May,
and on the 1st June the hen was incubating. A check when she was in
the shelter feeding two days later disclosed a third. The nest-cup was
very deep and no attempt was made to lift the eggs so I cannot add any
more to the coloration than I mentioned earlier. Incubation was normal
and was carried out as far as we know by the hen alone. In fact, late
some evenings one could observe the cock roosting alone in the shelter.
Three chicks were hatched either late on the 12th June or early on the
13th June, the 12th or 13th day after incubation commenced. I fed
sponge-cake soaked in nectar (which they ignored) fruit, the usual meat
preparation and small gentles. This live food had been supplied to them
daily after incubation had commenced and was the first live food given
them by us. The food was consumed in increasing quantities and was
fed to the young by both parents in turn. There were some heavy
thunderstorms on the 25th and 26th June and it was feared that the rain
would get into the nest-box, but a check disclosed what I thought was
two young birds fully fledged and quite dry in the deep cup, well to the
back of the box. I was very glad we had sited the open front to the north.
In the early afternoon of the 28th June just as we were going out I
spotted a young Festive Tanager perched on a shrub in the flight. It was
a bluish colour with dark markings on the wings and back. The weather
was fine and warm and as we watched a second young bird appeared on
the edge of the nest-box and dived for cover with the parents making
quite a commotion. As we did not expect to be back until after dark it
was thought that the best thing to do was to catch the two young birds
and shut them safely in the shelter with their parents. Before doing this
I checked the nest and out flew a third bird, smaller than the other two,
but fully fledged. This was the 15th or 16th day after hatching. We
kept the family in the shelter for two days and on the 30th June, in fine
and warm weather, we opened the pop-hole door and from that day for
some time they slept in the flight, each taking up a position in one or other
of the shrubs. They would settle down before dusk and were so motion-
less it was difficult at times to see them at all.
About this time we added soft skinned mealworms to the diet, but they
still continued to consume gentles, the meat preparation and two dishes a

day of diced fruit. It was amusing to see them lining up on a perch
calling for food. After a while both parents would commence to feed
them until they ceased to gape. Though the young birds were in fine
condition and could fly strongly from the moment they left the nest, they
made no attempt to feed themselves so far as we had time to observe.
However, on the 23rd July (the 25th day after leaving the nest) a change
came over the situation. The parents suddenly started carrying nesting
material and ignored the young birds demands for food. In the afternoon
the parents started to attack the young birds so we thought it was time to
catch up the youngsters and cage them. They were very wild at first
but soon steadied down and were quite able to feed themselves. We
quickly ceased feeding live food.
The parents carried nesting material for months afterwards and though
we put up two more nest-boxes in the flight and at different heights they
never went to nest again in 1967. This was very disappointing, but I
think we left the young birds with them too long and the parents did not
come into the peak of breeding condition again that year. We disposed
of the young birds to friends and as far as I know two were cocks and
one a hen.
At the time of writing (January, 1968), the parents have moulted out
again and daily bring into the shelter masses of leaves and grasses. I have
put up a nest-box in the shelter, just like the one they used in the flight
last summer, but they ignore it and first thing each morning when the
pop-hole to the flight is opened they are outside fussing around the three
nest-boxes. In these boxes they also hoard cut up grapes from the
previous day and these tit-bits are consumed in advance of the dish of
fruit they will receive later! The species seem able to stand a lot of
cold weather, any amount of rain, and I would term them better than
half-hardy. If we get a decent spring I shall leave them out at night a
little earlier this year and hope that they will breed again.

By Paolo Bertagnolio (Rome, Italy)
In August, 1967, Mr. Teresio Zucca, a keen softbills keeper of Rivoli
(Torino) paid me a visit. He came to Rome on purpose to see a collection
of about two hundred Tanagers, Euphonias, Chlorophonias, Honey-
creepers, etc., which I had freshly imported from Brazil through my good
friend Prof. Giuseppe Rossi della Riva of Sao Paulo.
In the course of our talk Mr. Zucca told me (without apparently
attaching great importance to it) that he had just obtained two chicks
by the pairing of two Tanagers of different species. As hybrids between
Tanagers are decidedly uncommon I asked Mr. Zucca for more particulars
in order to write a brief article for this Magazine.
With the aid of some colour slides subsequently received it was possible
to identify the male as a Blue-necked Tanager ( Tangara cyanicollis ) of the
sub-species granadensis (or perhaps cyanicollis ), while the female no doubt
was a Golden-masked Tanager ( Tangara nigro cincta larvata). The male
had been purchased during 1966, and the female had been in the possession
of Mr. Zucca since 1961.
About the end of the spring of 1967 the two birds were released in a
well-planted aviary 17 feet long, 10 feet wide and 7 feet high, together with
other softbills (mostly males) namely: Rufous-bellied Niltavas, Violaceous
Euphonias, Blue-naped Chlorophonias, Red-necked Tanagers, Paradise
Tanagers, Yellow-winged Sugarbirds, Indigo Buntings, Rainbow Buntings
and Gouldian Finches.
Soon a Blue-necked Tanager male was observed passing food to the
Golden-masked female. The latter, at the end of June, began to collect
dead bamboo leaves, grasses and wood wool, carrying them to a wire nest
(of the type commonly employed for Canaries) attached to the wall in the
covered portion of the flight.
A rough structure was completed in three or four days and immediately
after two eggs were laid on two consecutive days. Their colour was
whitish, spotted with brown, especially on the large end.
Incubation was carried out by the female, assiduously fed on the nest by
her mate. The latter, towards the tenth day, was seen on a few occasions
incubating for very short periods, of two or three minutes each time.
Two chicks hatched out after twelve or thirteen days. They grew
rapidly, fed by both parents who consumed large quantities of mealworms
and bread and milk. They left the nest at the age of fifteen days and ten
days later they were perfectly able to control their flight.
At this time they were mainly fed by their father who now also made
use of small pieces of apple and grapes.
The predominant colour of the hybrids was grey-brown, lighter on the
breast and darker on the head and neck.

At present the rump and the upper tail-coverts are turning to green
(the fact cannot surprise if we bear in mind that the male has a yellow
rump and upper tail-coverts, while in the same areas the female light
blue), while head and neck show a mixture of yellow and light blue feathers.
To conclude, I wish to point out that during all the phases of the breeding
there were no quarrels with other inhabitants of the flight, even when some
of them, by chance, passed near the nest.

PYRRHURA CONURES AND OTHERS
By Rosemary Low
My Pearly Conures (Pyrrhura perlata) have once again hatched three
youngsters (see Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 73, No. 1). They were
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.965826181818182" page_id="56364347"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
even later breeding in 1967 and at the time of writing (21st October) the
youngsters are still in the nest-box. The first egg was laid on the 24th
August. When I inspected the box on the 16th September there was
one youngster; by the 23rd three had hatched. As in the previous year,
four eggs were laid, the first presumably being clear. The youngsters
are now feathering up nicely but as these birds spend nearly eight weeks
in the nest-box, I do not expect them to emerge until the second week in
November.
Last year's three young Pearlies form part of a small colony of Pyrrhuras
with an adult Pearly, a single Red-bellied Conure (I also have a pair) and
a pair of Black-tailed (sometimes called Maroon-tailed) Conures (Pyrrhura
melanura) and live fairly amicably with a pair of Cockatiels and a
hen Malayan Long-tailed Parrakeet. It is fascinating to observe the
behaviour of a small colony of similar species; the " pecking order " is
most pronounced.
I cannot imagine that there is a more colourful species of Conure than
the Scarlet-bellied (Pyrrhura rhodogaster). A pair of these birds were
seen at the World Show of the C.O.M. held in Rotterdam in 1965, having
been brought from Brazil. They were greatly admired by everyone w T ho
saw them--but the numbers of their admirers decreased rapidly on learning
their price, which ran into three figures! I often wondered what became
of these birds until I visited Amsterdam Zoo in May, 1967, and saw what
appeared to be the same pair of birds.
The colouring of this species really is breathtaking! The whole of the
underparts from the upper chest to the vent are brilliant scarlet, in contrast
to the dark green upper parts. The cheeks are yellowish-green, the
scaled markings typical of the genus are whitish below the throat and
blue, black and white at the back of the head. The thighs and part of
the wings are blue and there is some blue on the cheeks. The under
tail-coverts are black, the upper tail-coverts maroon. The underwing
coverts are scarlet.*
* A coloured plate of this species appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for
June 1928.

I hope that Amsterdam Zoo are successful in breeding from these
lovely birds.
I have recently purchased a pair of young Aubrey's Parrots ( Poicephalus
gulielmi aubreyanus). This is a sub-species of the Jardine's Parrot which
it closely resembles. As the birds are in immature plumage, the beak is
apparently the only means of identification. According to the late Duke
of Bedford, the upper mandible is whitish, the lower one black, while in
the Jardine's it is black with a pale mark near the base of the upper
mandible.
The plumage is at present dark green with the exception of the wings
which are black scalloped with dark green. The forehead is also black
with two or three orange feathers beginning to appear. A few more
orange feathers are showing on the thighs, at the bend of the wing and
on the inside edge of the wing. The tail is black. In adult plumage
they will show much more orange on the head, thighs and wings.
I feel certain that I have a true pair as there is a very pronounced
difference in the upper mandibles. The " cock " has a flat ridge running
down the centre of the mandible, twice as wide as that of the hen. His
beak is also more massive.
They have a very soft call note: " Hoo "--more reminiscent of an owl
than a parrot!--besides some quiet chirping call notes. They feed
mainly on sunflower seed, apple and grapes.
I was extremely pleased to acquire these birds which are very rarely
imported. I had long admired a tame specimen at the London Zoo.

In the May-June, 1967, number of Avicultural Magazine Robin
L. Restall has a very interesting article about the Brown Grosbeak
(Neorhynchus peruvianus).
In 1964 I bred the first young in Denmark and I too, have studied the
literature.
In " Stuefuglene," May, 1962, the Danish Avicultural Magazine , the
editor, Albrecht-Moller, who since 1931 bred eight species of Sporophila ,
and in all has possessed eighteen species, gave a description and informa-
tion about N. peruvianus.
The first firm to import these birds to Europe was Schonlube, Berlin.
A collection of them arrived in 1927, as usual with Sporophila , mostly
males, but Berlin Zoo obtained one pair, and Karl Neunzig gave an
illustration in " Gefiederte Welt ", not a very good one. After Rudolf
Neunzig had found out the species, the German name was given as

to me very fit and the translation is used in Denmark. In Liibeck,
Germany, there were six on exhibition on nth-i2th December, 1927,
and it was regarded as a sensation. On 23rd February, 1938, Otto
Steinhagen wrote in " Gefiederte Welt ", that he had a female laying eggs
but with no mention of young. A label on a skin in the Berlin Museum
says that a Mr. Stefani bred this bird in 1927-32.
In January, 1931, there were again some on the German market and in
1932 Rudolf Neunzig reports that he bought two pairs in Copenhagen,
where they had been for nine months. This must have been in 1930,
when Karl and Rudolf Neunzig visited the town as judges at an exhibition.
In i960 Albrecht-Moller bought a male, and in 1962 he bought a pair.
In " Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia ",
de Schaunsee, in a revision of the genus Sporophila , writes, that N.
peruvianus and Sp. simplex inhabit the arid Pacific littoral of Ecuador and
Peru. N. peruvianus has a strongly curved, parrot-like maxilla, and the
female of this species is nothing but a giant relation of Sp. simplex , a
hen-plumaged species. He altered the name to Sp. peruviana. Females
of both have exactly the same colour pattern on the wing and are very
similar in general coloration. There are two races. The Peruvian race
is the larger and the following measurements are given:
Sp. peruviana peruviana:
male: wing 62-65.5 mm. tail 42-44 mm. culmen 11-5-12*5 mm.
female: , 57-61 , , 39-43 , , 11*5
Sp. peruviana devronis:
male: , 55-5-59 , , 39-42 , , 10-10-5 ,
female: , 52-5 , , 39 , , 11
Chapman: " The Distribution of Bird Life in Ecuador ( Bulletin of
American Museum of Natural History , Vol. 55, 1926): " Neorhynchus
lives in the arid, tropical Zone of Ecuador ", and this Zone is in the south-
western part of Ecuador, not in the north-eastern, where it is humid
tropical.
As for my own experience with the species, I obtained the first specimens
in 1963, one male and two females. From Ecuador, 1964, a pair was
released in an outdoor aviary, 150 cm. by 250 cm. by 200 cm. in height,
with some ten other seed-eating birds of the same size. There were
plenty of pine-branches in the aviary, and on 18th July I unexpectedly
saw a fledgling of Sp. peruviana. It had a short tail and its general
appearance was much like the female. The young thrived well, but about
the 1 st September the male suddenly began chasing the offspring, which
already had some wounds when I got it out of the aviary.
2nd September--I found a nest, very flimsy, woven from coco-fibre.
The three eggs were greenish-white with some brown spots.
10th September--There were three nestlings, the skin very light with
some dark down.
16th September--One was found dead on the floor.

21 st September--The remaining two nestlings left the nest.
25th September--One of them was found dead.
30th November--One young was killed by a cat, so I was left with only
one, which a month later proved to be a male.
About 24th July, 1964, Albrecht-Moller had one young from his pair.
The young male was, with an imported female, given to a friend, and in
1965 they bred one young.
The group of Sporophila is a very interesting one, with thirty-seven
species and about thirty-three sub-species, of different size, with very
great difference in bill-size and form. Of the more seldom imported
species I have at present Sp. telasco , which nested January, 1966;
the nest with four eggs unfortunately destroyed by some other inhabitant
of the indoor aviary. The female died later, and now there are two males
and a female left. Furthermore, I have obtained three Sp. ohscura obscura,
also imported from Ecuador.
All Sporophila are very aggressive towards each other, especially at
breeding times; they even go so far as to kill each other. Therefore
only one pair in each aviary.

THE ROLE OF SENTIMENT IN AVICULTURE

Here is a fascinating subject on which entire books could have been
and no doubt have been written. One of my dictionaries defines
" sentiment " as a " general emotional attitude ", also " a tendency to be
influenced by emotion, not reason ". Both definitions apply with more
or less emphasis to the aviculturists I know from long years of personal
experience.
First of all, nine out of ten bird-hobbyists maintain a quite pronounced
emotional (feeling) attitude to their birds, of whatever species these may
happen to be. As a matter of fact, the liking they manifested at first
for their feathered charges soon grew into fondness as a result of familiarity,
daily familiarity with their more or less appealing ways and individual
behaviour, and ultimately matured in pronounced affection for given
individuals, not infrequently called " pets ". This liking I have found
even among pet-shop keepers, principally women, who are supposed to
be in business solely for the sake of the " almighty dollar ", and not for
sentimental reasons. However, there exists a certain affinity between
man and birds, which seems to be irresistible on both sides.
It is perhaps no exaggeration to aver that most species of birds kept in
confinement make a definite emotional appeal to their keepers by various
means. First of all, there is plumage colour: the more striking it happens
to be, the more " ohs " and " ahs " it is likely to elicit from the bird-keepers
and their friends. These excited, even joyous exclamations, oft repeated,
make such a deep impression on the former, who are daily, if not hourly,

affected by this display of colour that they themselves cannot help exclaim
over its magnificence whenever they feel like showing their birds off to
visitors and friends. These oft-repeated exclamations tend, of course,
to deepen their affection for their birds, a highly personal and individual
feeling, the expression of which, whether voiced or unvoiced, affords these
bird-men and women considerable satisfaction, if not actual happiness.
Next to plumage colour, aviary birds make a pronounced emotional
appeal to their keepers by means of their voices. Many an aviculturist
" specializes " so to say, this writer included, in keeping birds mainly
for the sake of their singing capabilities. This " captive " bird music
expressed in its natural, instinctive form, especially when emanating from
the throats of highly accomplished avian performers, such as the Nightin-
gale, Blackbird, Oriole, et al ., has been known to " lift " the listener into
a near-trance, from which he is reluctant to be awakened. The appeal
made by such bird music is almost 100% emotional, reasoning having no
place whatever in it.
When the voices of birds either by natural or artificial means can be
made to resemble, even in the slightest degree, those of human beings,
their emotional effect is almost 100% plus! In partial proof I need only
cite the relationship of keepers of parrot-like birds, who in a great many
instances maintain very close, if not intimate, connections with their
feathered friends day in and day out, bestowing most conscientious care
and tenderest " love " on them, going at times to the extreme of kissing
them. Especially is this the case of parrots raised by hand, who seem to
thrive on such " personal " relationships with their owners and keepers.
Of course, their usually colourful plumage also plays an important part
in the affection with which their keeper regards them.
To a considerably lesser extent, specific behaviour of certain species of
birds, such as grace of movement, dexterity in flight, fearlessness of human
beings, and many other aspects peculiar to this or that species may call
forth a strong feeling reaction, usually one of liking and admiration, in
the beholder.
So, our aviculturists, at least the ones I have known for the past twenty-
five years, are creatures of emotion when it is a matter of their hobby,
which only in rare cases is combined with making money. The very
enjoyment of their pastime is for them pure joy and great personal
satisfaction most of the time. And why shouldn't it so be? The majority
of them are but little concerned with the so-called objective, semi-
scientific behaviour of their birds: their relationship to ornithology is
indeed not only fragile, but in most cases unintentional; and this despite
the fact that through his intimate relationship with his birds, many an
aviculturist gathers over the years a truly large amount of worthwhile
information relating to the behaviour of his birds--information often
unknown to students of bird life, and which, if properly analysed and
classified, as well as promptly reported, would add appreciably to the
general fund of bird knowledge.

THE 1967 BREEDING SEASON AT LECKFORD
By Terry Jones (Stockbridge, Hants, England)
The 1967 breeding season at Leckford, like all seasons in a large
collection, was partly good and partly disappointing. I would like just
once to have a season which was without failures.
Black and Black-necked Swans bred well as they generally do, the former
of which we have three breeding pairs, are nesting all the year round.
The latest broods are two of six cygnets each, one brood hatched mid-
November and the other on the ist December. The cygnets are perhaps
the hardiest of all baby waterfowl and are indifferent to frost and snow as
long as they have always plenty of food and swimming water. It is
strange that this species which in a natural state must never meet iced
conditions and nearly always lives in high temperatures should be so
hardy.
We have at last reared Coscoroba Swans. We have had a laying
female, bred in Philadelphia Zoo, who has laid several clutches annually
for a number of years. But first of all every mate we bought her, when
sent over from Holland, proved to be another female. I think we bought
four such one after the other. Finally we got a magnificent male, but
each year the eggs were clear. About three years ago when Mr. Peter
Kooy, Sr., was here I asked him if he would try and find me a male from
their dealers' importations. This he kindly did and the male arrived, a
much smaller bird than the original, in fact about the same size as the
female. This year he was put with her and her original mate put with a
wild-caught female who has never laid. The old lady accepted him, but
when spring arrived the old male was in marvellous fettle charging up and
even attacking when we went to feed him while the Kooy male swam about
quietly with the female. And I, poor mutt, was sure the original male
had finally got orientated to our seasons while the new male was not,
so I swopped them over and the old lady laid six clear eggs! Back they
were changed, the result four fertile eggs which we took after the female
had sat about half time and put them under a Sumatra game hen. Four
cygnets hatched and were reared, three females and one male. The
cygnets, as is well known, are marked rather like young Fulvous Tree Ducks
and have the tree ducklings head band.
We reared our first Eytons Tree ducks, the first bred in this country,
but we had a hand-reared female bred by Mr. Kooy. The eggs rather
small and more pointed than other Tree Ducks. The ducklings are
sandy coloured and the flank stripe is continuous from the trailing edge
of the wing to the stern and not broken into blotches. We also reared
Whitefaced and Fulvous ducklings but unfortunately only four of the
latter as the drake got caught by a stoat which injured his neck and though
his two wives laid as usual two or three clutches each all the subsequent
eggs were clear.

We bred a good number of Ross's and Bar-head, but the Red-breasted
were a sad blow. We had procured some wild-caught ganders which
apparently had not become thoroughly at home, the result completely
clear clutches, only one goose paired to a hand-reared gander produced
any fertile eggs.
The Cackling gander fell for a domestic cock and his mate consoled
herself with a Lesser White-fronted gander when her mate was not
looking; the result three goslings which looked like minute dusky Canadas.
They were exceptionally tame and were given to friends into whose house
they march for tea, two little geese and a gander, Illy, Jitty and Mate.
The star performer amongst the geese was the female Abyssinian Blue-
wing who laid five clutches, after hatching eight out of eight from her
fourth; we were so overloaded with Abyssinians that we ate the fifth!
We reared broods from all the Shelduck except the Radjah and the
European. Of the former we have an imported pair of the New Guinea
race of which the female lost a foot in the hard winter of 1963. I thought
she was going to lay this spring. She chose a box, was very noisy and
just did not make it. Perhaps next spring.
We deliberately didn't hatch any eggs from a number of the commoner
species and from those for which there is little or no demand such as
Laysan, Philippine and Chestnut-breasted Teal. The trouble with the
Mallards is that with the exception of the Northern, they are dull coloured.
I like them. I think Yellowbills and Philippines are elegant and the
Laysan delightfully tame, but they all breed like rabbits and no one
seems to want them so we set none of these eggs. No one since the late
Lord Lilford, so far as I know, has made a collection of the Mallards.
He had a curator, whom most of us knew only as an old man, Arthur
Moody, and he had an expression when showing off the more unusual
members of the Mallard family which has passed into the language of
breeders today: "Not showy but rare ".
We obtained wild-caught Puna Teal drakes so had the first new blood
in this species which we have kept going from a single pair imported in
1938 or 39. Four New Zealand Brown Teal were hatched and reared,
easily reared, but difficult because they would bite each other's eyes and
one or other continually had a torn lid.
Tom Spence sent us his pair of White-naped Cranes before he went to
Australia. I did not really expect them to breed as they had little time to
settle down. They did lay, however, one egg hatched and the other had a
fully formed chick. The chick was reared exactly as the Sarus chick
about which I wrote in detail. As a little chick it was nothing like so
tame as the baby Sarus, would not take food from one's fingers and never
had the dual affection for us and for the hen foster mother as the Sarus
had. But after it grew up it became very tame and likes human company
--provided it knows the humans.

TERRY JONES--THE 1 967 BREEDING SEASON AT LECKFORD
The Parrakeets were not so good as usual. Our two old pairs of
Stanleys produced three each instead of six each as last year. The third
pair, a young home-bred hen and a cock lent by Sir Crawford McCullagh,
had six clear eggs. The very old pair of Princess of Wales have gone to
Mr. Dolton. The No. 2 pair, about six years old which have bred
regularly, never laid. I suspect I gave them the wrong box; one should
number nest-boxes if they are removed in winter so they can be replaced
as before. Two pairs of Pennant's produced seven young, but four
cracked their skulls in night panics. This is something that happens
annually here and I think it is probably due to the width of our aviaries.
They are 8 feet wide and 35 feet long. Most breeders' aviaries are quite
narrow so if youngsters panic in the night as they fly in the dark, one or
other wing is almost bound to hit the wire bringing them to the ground
while our birds must quite often go to the whole way hitting either the
end wire or the house at full speed.
The late Duke of Bedford, when Marquess of Tavistock, used to write
most amusing and interesting articles on his birds and he invented a
sinister character called Mr. X who brought on sudden and unexpected
tragedies just when everything seemed to be going fine. Like the Marquess,
Mr. X seems particularly interested in the parrot families and people who
keep them have fairly regular visits from him. Pie generally looks at our
birds at night, but this year he took a peep at a brood of Princess of Wales
in the nest and forgot to shut the box again so I found four quilled babies
dead on the flight floor; it had been raining steadily. Provided things
appear normal I don't look in the boxes nor go into the flights. This
aviary contained two pairs consisting of three 1966 birds, two hens and a
cock and an adult cock. The old cock and a hen had this brood. The
backs are kept closed by swivel fasteners. The birds, particularly Princess
of Wales, are always fooling around their boxes and I suspect someone
was trying to alight on the back and turned the button. I shall put bolts
on before next season. They laid again and produced a fine youngster,
a singleton. This later fractured its skull! The last pair of Princess of
Wales consisting of an Australian-bred cock and a home-bred hen, who
had bred normally the two previous seasons. The hen laid and ate her
first three clutches and then sat on her fourth and reared three nice
youngsters. Finally the pair of Rock Peplars, which belong to Peter
Paris, laid four clear eggs. Perhaps next year . . .!

By M. Peaker and Stephanie J. Peaker (Hong Kong)
In recent months a controversy has developed amongst aviculturists on
the composition of food for maintaining Humming Birds in captivity.
Articles and letters have appeared in Avicultural Magazine and in
Cage and Aviary Birds. In general, the well-known importer and dealer,
Mr. P. H. Hastings has criticized the use of foods other than his own
Stimulite brand by experienced and successful aviculturists. Unfor-
tunately, the basis for his arguments appear to be shrouded in serious
misinterpretations of what he calls " scientific facts ".
This controversy has prompted us to analyse the feeding of Humming
Birds on a reasoned physiological basis and to compare the underlying
principles of the formation of existing diets.
All diets for the maintenance of birds in captivity must take into account
the natural food of the animals in the wild. It has often been recorded
that Humming Birds feed on nectar together with insects and other small
invertebrates. Nectar is a solution consisting mainly of sugars--usually
glucose and fructose in approximately equal proportions and in some plants,
sucrose (see Spector, 1956). The live insects consist mainly (apart from
water) of protein together with fat, some carbohydrate, minerals and
certain other compounds. The sugar from the nectar is absorbed into
the body and used for all the bird's activities as a source of energy. Any
excess can be converted into glycogen, which acts only as an energy store
for use in an emergency or into fat. Complex carbohydrates ingested as
part of the insect or as sucrose in nectar are broken down into simple
sugars (glucose, fructose) in the intestine and dealt with in a similar
manner.
Fat taken into the body is used in the structural form of cells, as an
energy source or as an energy reserve in the form of fat deposits in some
animals.
Therefore, in the Humming Bird, the sugar from ingested nectar is the
main supply of energy for the processes of the body. The extremely high
metabolic rate of these birds necessitates an extremely large carbohydrate
intake.
Animal bodies consist, to a very great extent, of protein and, therefore,
substances containing protein must be ingested. The insect's body is
broken down in the alimentary canal of the bird and the protein into
amino-acids. These amino-acids are absorbed from the intestine and
built up into the bird's own protein. Amino-acids, if not required
immediately for protein synthesis, cannot be stored and are then in part
used to supply energy and in part excreted as uric acid in the urine.
In the wild, insects supply the necessary protein and it appears that a
variety of insects in large quantities and nectar could maintain a bird in

captivity. However, sufficient insects usually cannot be given so that the
basic sugar solution must be supplemented with substances that would
normally be present in the insect part of the diet. Knowing that protein
must be given, there is a choice of how this can be done--as complex
proteins, amino-acids or chains of amino-acids (polypeptides). In
whichever form it is given, it enters the bloodstream of the bird as amino-
acids (with a few exceptions that do not arise here).
All the amino-acids are utilized to build up the Humming Bird's own
protein and if one or several are missing in the diet, they can be synthesized
from others by a process known as transamination. However, higher
animals have lost the ability to construct certain amino-acids from those
already present and these must be included in the diet. One of the most
important misunderstandings in animal nutrition is the list of essential
amino-acids, i.e. those that have to be present in the dietary protein.
This list applies to the rat or man but not to birds, for, in general, more
amino-acids are essential in this group. Thus two additional ones are
required by the hen. The addition of the essential dietary amino-acids
to nectar is therefore by no means ensuring that the essential factors are
supplied to the Humming Bird. The hen's list is perhaps nearer but it
is impossible without many years of experimental work to determine a
Humming Bird's list. Therefore, to be safe, all the amino-acids should
be supplied and the best way to do this is by supplying animal protein or
polypeptide chains derived from animal protein. Whilst a partial mixture
of animo-acids may be sufficient, it may not since differences between
groups of animals have been recorded.
We understand that, as Mrs. K. M. Scamell suggests, Gevral Protein
supplies the need fully and can easily be suspended in the nectar whereas
the food supplied by Mr. Hastings probably contains the essential amino-
acids but may not. Moreover, we are in favour of supplying protein or
polypeptide chains to allow digestion to take place and to keep the digestive
enzymes working fully to deal with the solid (insect) part of protein intake.
Some fat may also be necessary and in the rat, two fatty-acids--linoleic
acid and linolenic acid are essential dietary factors.
One group of substances that receives a great deal of attention is the
vitamins. These play roles in the biochemical processes of the body.
It appears that, originally, vitamins could themselves be synthesized by
the animal from other materials. This ability has been lost in certain
animals and in the wild, dietary sources are usually adequate but in
confinement it must be ensured that these factors are present in the diet.
As with the essential amino-acids, it is not possible to fully extrapolate
the list of vitamins essential for one group to another. A well-known
example is vitamin C (ascorbic acid). This substance can be synthesized
by most animals but in man, other primates, the guinea-pig and the
dalmatian breed of dog, but not other breeds, vitamin C cannot be produced
and is therefore an essential dietary factor in these types.

M. PEAKER AND STEPHANIE J. PEAKER--FEEDING HUMMING BIRDS 57
Assuming that there is a need for vitamins, then these can easily be
supplied as an essential dietary factor or to supplement the bird's own
production. This does not mean to say that vitamins can be supplied
indiscriminately. Excess vitamins A and D are known to be injurious to
man and many other animals.
Although essential dietary factors must be taken into the animal, in
some cases they need not be ingested as part of the food since bacteria
in the intestine synthesize vitamins which are then absorbed by the bird
in the usual way. In many cases, these vitamins, usually of the B complex
need only be supplied when the balance between the bacteria and the
animal is disturbed, after oral antibiotic treatment, for example.
Minerals, some in " trace amounts " are essential and can easily be
supplied as a dietary additive that can be dissolved or suspended in the
nectar.
Finally, of course, water is necessary and this, in the wild, can be
obtained by drinking rain water collected in flowers, from nectar, from the
body-fluids of the insect prey and from the utilization of food substances
(metabolic water). The ingestion of strong sugar solutions could place a
severe osmotic stress on the bird so it might be beneficial to supply weaker
nectar as well as the usual mixture. Moreover, the latter should not
exceed the concentration of wild nectar. A too strong nectar could result
in dehydration of the tissues of the bird and could correspond to the
dehydration noted by Mr. Hastings which he states to be due to the
sugar. 1 We would question whether this is due to the sugar per se for
we think that the solution of sugar could have been too strong thus placing
the bird into a dire osmotic state. In fact, natural nectar exceeds the
strength of the body fluids so that the bird must rely upon absorption and
utilization of the sugar to leave free water. Absorption is often affected
in sick birds so that any nectar consumed serves to kill the animal by de-
hydration and this would show post mortem rather than a primary cause of
illness. The situation is similar to that of a man drinking sea water.
The sodium chloride cannot be removed by the body to leave osmotically-
free water. The ill bird cannot remove the sugar from a solution almost
as strong as sea water.
The food used by Mrs. Scamell in breeding Violet-eared Humming
Birds is worthy of comment. It consists of a 17% sucrose solution to
which is added Gevral Protein. This concentrated food contains proteins,
polypeptides and amino-acids in easily assimilable form plus vitamins and
1 We are not sure whether Mr. Hastings when writing of sugar is using it to
signify sucrose or all sugars. Mr. Hastings' interpretation is further complicated
by his advertisements (see Avicultural Magazine, 73, No. 2) in which Stimulite
is said to contain " Glucose, Dextrose, Hexose, Maltose, Sucrose ". Since
glucose is a hexose sugar and dextrose is the dextro-rotatory form of glucose (the
laevo- rotatory form is not biologically active), the first three ingredients are one
and the same substance, unless the hexose is another hexose like fructose in which
case it should be stated.

minerals. Although in part relatively insoluble, it can as Mrs. Scamell
suggests be added to the sugar solution in suspension and ingested
satisfactorily by the animals. The diet is supplemented with Drosophila.
Obviously this food is successful since a Humming Bird has been bred
and reared and theoretically it satisfies the nutritional requirements. We
would be tempted to modify it in one respect to include equal amounts of
glucose and fructose to make a 17% sugar solution rather than sucrose
since nectar contains these two simple sugars exclusively or to a greater
extent than sucrose. Although enzymes exist for sucrose to be broken
down in the alimentary canal, we would prefer to present the carbohydrate
in the form it is received in the wild.
It is very likely that Mr. Hastings' Stimnlite nectar food contains
sufficient nutriment but the extra protein provided by Mrs. ScameU's
diet may well be a deciding factor in its favour. Moreover, it should be
remembered that sufficient protein is necessary to allow " breeding
condition " to develop, for it is known that protein-deficiency results in
a decreased output of gonadotrophic hormones from the anterior lobe of
the pituitary gland and these hormones are the ones that induce breeding
in all its aspects. It is important that plenty of protein, in the nectar or
insects should be available at all times and not just when breeding.
Unfortunately, Mr. Hastings' advocacy of his food does not perhaps
match the value of this food. His advertisements and letters have revealed
serious misunderstandings of the physiological basis of nutrition. As we
have attempted to demonstrate, extrapolation from one species or group
to another is extremely difficult and the fact that a food for Humming
Birds is suitable for man does not make it suitable for Humming Birds.
One is tempted to dismiss Mr. Hastings' food on the grounds that the
reasoning on which it is based is open to very severe criticism but there
is no doubt that he has tried and succeeded in making a very acceptable
nectar food for Humming Birds as well as for adding to the food of other
birds. With plenty of Drosophila or other insects, it would, in all
probability, be fully adequate for breeding but if there is any doubt we
would use the Gevral Protein formula, although not exclusively. We are
firm believers in a varied diet to simulate changing feeding patterns in
the wild.
It is obvious that very great advances are now being made in keeping
and breeding Humming Birds. Much praise must go to the importers
who are using modern transport methods. A great deal of effort over
many years has resulted in a number of feeding methods being suitable
at least for their maintenance. What is now needed is a critical appraisal
of all aspects of Humming Bird care to try to elucidate the important
factors in their maintenance and breeding but such appraisals are com-
plicated enough without being the subject of dogmatic statements and
misquoted, ill-informed facts.

OBSERVATIONS OF A FULL YEAR'S BREEDING
BEHAVIOUR OF A PAIR OF KEY-WEST QUAIL
DOVES

Since coming into possession of this pair of Key-West Quail Doves
some five years ago, I have on several occasions reported their breeding
behaviour in this Magazine. Each year heretofore the pair has been
rather prolific, raising a number of youngsters to maturity. The young-
sters rarely breed before they are two years old. This fact has been
confirmed by the several fanciers to whom pairs of young, but reasonably
mature, specimens have been sold. It is interesting to note that whenever
two youngsters have been raised to maturity, they turn out to be male and
female, and they seem to become inseparable, staying together during the
day and roosting side by side at night, even though showing no sexual
tendencies, such as cooing or even mating, for the first six months.
Youngsters of Key-West Quail Doves may safely be left with the parent
birds for some months after leaving the nest, both parties getting along
splendidly, even in a rather small pen. The fact that this particular
species, at least my breeding pair, is extremely tame has greatly facilitated
my observations of their various activities. The breeding pair now under
consideration has not been kept with any other kind of doves, sharing a
pen with a few medium-sized softbills, of which I keep quite a number.
In appraising these birds' behaviour, one should keep in mind that they
live in a rather mild climate, which may, at least in part, be responsible

Both male and female are sitting in an open-top nest-box side
by side, having built a very flimsy nest, as is usual with
most doves.
Laid only one egg, which they left after two days of brooding.
Laid another egg, but would not sit on it.
Both birds are inspecting various nesting sites.
New nesting site, another open-top box, adopted. No eggs
laid as yet.
Both male and female mainly on the floor of the aviary; no
eggs laid as yet.

Laid one egg; deserted after two days' brooding.
I separated the sexes, keeping them far apart from each other,

It is likely that the " erratic " behaviour of this pair of doves in frequently
deserting nest and eggs soon after laying, and also in laying but one egg
to a setting quite often, is due to age or to continual breeding, even though
rest periods were given on several occasions. It is worthwhile noting
that this pair has been in continuous breeding condition while under
observation, the male bird flitting his wingtips and cooing and displaying
before his mate, and both birds being almost constantly in or about the
nesting-box. The food given them has not varied during the entire
period, the birds showing a preference for popcorn and diced longhorn
cheese, taking but little millet, milo, and various mixed grass-seeds.
No mealworms were eaten. It is, of course, difficult to say to what extent
climatic conditions have affected their behaviour.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS
IN ZURICH ZOO, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE
TO BREEDING ACTIVITIES
</sectionHeader>

By Christian R. Schmidt (Zoological Garden of Zurich, Switzerland.
Director: Professor Dr. H. Hediger)
We had great hopes that 1967 would be as successful as 1966, which
was so far the best year for the bird department of the Zurich Zoo. This
proved to be true, despite some disappointments.
The first open-fronted flight aviary of Europe was built in 1954 at the
Zurich Zoo. Some sixty birds representing twenty-one different species
from all the continents are living there.
One of the most interesting species is the Tinamou (Rhynchotus
rufescens). Unfortunately we received only a single specimen. However
it joined a lonely European Curlew (Numenius arquata , already living
sixteen years in Zurich Zoo), which--for human eyes--resembles it most
of all the birds living in that aviary. The Tinamou followed the Curlew
everywhere for some weeks. Since the Curlew didn't show any reactions
towards it, the Tinamou ceased to be interested in the Curlew.
The Tinamou laid eggs scattered around in the aviary on 30th March,

average measurement is 57 by 46 millimetres, the largest measuring
59 by 47 millimetres, and the smallest measuring 54 by 45 millimetres.
Another lonesome bird in the same aviary is a male Carolina Dove
(Zenaida m. macroura). It carries out its courtship display (cooing, see
Goodwin, 1966) often some fifteen centimetres in front of the female
Tinamou. It was even once observed mounting on the Tinamou's back
and trying to copulate with the much larger Tinamou!
A group of Common Rheas ( Rhea americana) is kept in a grassy enclosure
all the year round. Some trees just outside the yard cannot be reached
by the Rheas because the twigs are too high. However, one female Rhea
was seen several times jumping off the ground some twenty centimetres
(leaving the ground with both feet simultaneous) to browse.
The European White Storks ( Ciconia ciconia ) reared young for the
first time for many years. One pair laid five eggs on 26th, 28th, 30th 1
March, 1st and 4th April, 1967, respectively. Two young ones hatched !
on 7th May, a third on 8th May and a fourth on 9th May. The latter--
which was weak--died three days later. The others were raised success-
fully. Another pair laid eggs on 2nd and 4th April. By 9th April there
were four eggs in the nest and on 1 ith April a fifth was laid. Four young
from this clutch hatched on 15th May, and all were raised.
When anyone approached the nest at two weeks the young Storks |
showed immobility. Wackernagel (1967) observed the same phenomen j
at an age of four weeks. When the Storks were three weeks old they 1
started standing on their legs. At the age of three-and a-half weeks they
left the nest for the first time together with their parents.
In our colony of Cattle Egrets ( Bubulcus i. ibis) --which is kept with
rhinos and hippos in the Africa-house (Schmidt, 1967)--we noted eggs
from 1 st February until 26th August, 1967. In March and May three
young hatched. However, they disappeared after some days as also did
many of the eggs. The reason for this is not clear. We failed to raise
artificially a young Egret hatched on 7th May.
We are keeping one male and two female White Ibises ( Eudocimus albus)
in the open-fronted flight aviary. We supplement their food with
Canthaxantin (F. Hoffmann la Roche &amp; Co. Ltd., Basle, Switzerland)
because two Scarlet Ibises (E. ruber) and two male Orange Cocks-of-the-
Rock are living in the same aviary. The male White Ibis showed a
reaction to that carotinoid as it became pinkish while (Kornerup and
Wanscher, 1961, colour A 2 of plate 7 ). It arrived in 1964 in brown
youth plumage and now still has some dark feathers on the head. During
April and the first half of May, 1967, all five Ibises developed for the first
time a full skin-sac below the base of the bill. It was much larger in the
male White Ibis (Illustration 1) than in the other specimens. During the
same time it showed some nesting activity, but was disturbed by the
two scarlet specimens. The sac became empty in the middle of May,
but was still visible until it disappeared in July.

The same pair of Screamers ( Chauna torquata) mentioned by Hediger
and Bucher (1964) bred again in 1964. Eggs were deposited in the same
nest on an islet as in 1963 on 5th May, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th July, 1964,
respectively. On 20th August two chicks hatched. They swam to the
shore for the first time on their fourth day. Up to September they spent
the nights on the islet. One of the chicks died on 2nd October of acute
pneumonia. Its weight was 650 grammes. The other one died some
days earlier. In 1965 the same pair laid the first egg on 5th April--still
in the heated winter quarter. Further eggs were noted on nth April,
1965, 25th and 26th May, 1966, on the same site as in the previous years.
All these eggs proved to be infertile as well as an especially small one laid
on 6th June, 1967. It might be that this pair is now too old for breeding.
In East Africa one can often observe Egyptian Geese ( Alopochen
aegyptiacus ) and River Hippos ( Hippopotamus amphibius ) living closely
together, side by side, in the same lakes. We therefore tried to introduce
a pair of Egyptian Geese--long residents of the zoo--into the outside
hippo-enclosure. However, the young adult, zoo-born, female Hippo
killed the female goose immediately after introduction. The gander was
then removed from the enclosure.
Two pairs of Griffon Vultures ( Gyps fulvus) produced eggs on 23rd
January and 6th February, 1967, respectively. The first pair incubated
the egg for forty-six days. Then the egg vanished. Another egg was
laid thirty-three days later on 23rd April. It was placed in the electric
incubator, but proved to be infertile. The egg of the other pair dis-
appeared after an incubation period of twenty days. A second egg was
laid thirty-six days later, on 3rd April, which again was infertile. Both
parents shared in brooding. According to Jonch (1966) the incubation
period for this species in Barcelona Zoo was sixty days, and eggs were
laid in January.
A pair of Golden Eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos) produced two eggs by 24th
March, 1966, which disappeared some days later. In 1967 two eggs were
observed on 2nd April which were incubated until 28th May when we
found only some portions of the eggshell.
In 1965 Zurich Zoo bought a pair of Satyr Tragopan ( Tragopan satyr a)
bred the same year in Germany. In the first half of April, 1967, the
cock showed for the first time its beautiful courtship display--only in the
morning not later than 9 a.m.
A pair of Demoiselle Cranes (Anthropoides virgo) produced infertile
eggs on 9th and 12th May, 1967. They were incubated for forty-three
days; that is quite remarkable because the normal incubation time lasts
only twenty-seven to twenty-eight days (Moody cited by Makatsch, 1959).
A female Red and Green Macaw (Ara chloroptera ) paired with a Blue
and Yellow Macaw [Ara ararauna ) laid two eggs, 3rd and 5th May, 1967,
in a barrel. They were crushed four days later. Hybridization between
these two species is quite common in zoos (Hill, 1947; Lang and Stamm,
1956; Haas 1964, 1965; Muller, 1966, 1967).

In 1962 we purchased one male and three female Snowy Owls (Nyctea
scandiaca). Two of the females--bred the same year (Poulsen, 1963)--
were kindly donated by the Copenhagen Zoo. The first two eggs were
noted 25th May, 1965. Five eggs were laid in May, 1966. Two females
crouched in sandy depressions only half a metre apart. Both deserted
their nest-sites after heavy rain. No young ones hatched that year. In
1967 the females chose another nest-site on the highest part of the aviary.
All three were sitting side by side in close contact. Throughout the
month of May, 1967, many eggs were produced in two of the nest depres-
sions. However, in June one of the females was seen feeding on a broken
egg. Therefore, the remaining five eggs were put in the electric incubator.
Owlets hatched on 25th, 26th June (hatching weight 45 grammes), 3rd July
(hatching weight 45 grammes) and 7th July (hatching weight 40 grammes).
The three younger birds died after a few days. The first owlet was raised
artificially with great success. Its growth-rate is shown in Figure 1. It

was fed the first three days exclusively on bloody intestines and meat of
mice. Later its diet consisted of minced mice, ox-heart and liver
supplemented with Vionate (E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, New York). The
owlet first opened its eyes at the age of six days--although it still kept
them closed much of the time. The first pellet was regurgitated one day
later. At an age of ten days it took some pieces of meat by itself for the
first time. The change of the dark-spotted youth plumage into the pure
white male plumage started on the head and throat at the end of Septem-
ber, 1967. At the end of November its belly, wings and tail were still
spotted.

We obtained two pairs of Striated Colies (Colius striatus ) from the well-
known specialist Dr. H. Schifter, Vienna. They were kept for some years
in a small inside aviary (2 by 1*5 metres by i*8 metres high) where they
showed no attempt to breed. However, after being released into the large
open-fronted flight aviary both pairs reared altogether six young ones in
April, July and October, 1967. One pair chose as nest-site a wire basket
attached on the ceiling below a ventilation hole. The brooding Coly held
its long tail straight upwards because that nest was so small. Compre-
hensive studies on the reproductive behaviour of Colies were undertaken
by Lint (1963) and Schifter (1963, 1965).
A pair of Kookaburras (Dacelo gigas) was purchased in 1957. Eggs
were laid on 15th April, 1963, nth March, 1964, February, 1st, 2nd and
5th April, and August, 1965. All these eggs were infertile or the embryos
died in the egg.
Copulation was observed on 16th January, 1966. Eggs were laid on
29th and 31st January into a hollow tree placed high in a corner of the
inside aviary. A young one hatched on 24th February. It was killed
the next day by the inexperienced male. It obviously regarded its
young as prey and hit it as these birds do with mice. Wackernagel (1963)
reports that the same happened in an inexperienced pair with their first
offspring in Basel Zoo. Further eggs were laid in the same box on 12th
and 14th March. One young hatched on 5th April, 1966. However,
it broke its legs which was not noted. It was euthanized because the
fracture healed incorrectly. Three more eggs were noted by 7th June.
They turned out to be infertile.
Next egg-laying took place on 7th, 8th and 10th February, 1967,
respectively. Three young ones hatched after an incubation period of
twenty-four days for each young one. Both parents fed them with baby
mice. Two of the young birds weighed 250 and 330 grammes respectively
on 21 st March (Illustration No. 2). They were not able to do any sound
until an age of twenty-five days. The weight of one was then 400 grammes
in comparison to 320 grammes of the Basel chick at about the same age
(Wackernagel, op. cit.). At the age of thirty-two days one still weighed
400 grammes and produced already some kind of " laughing ". The young
Kookaburra in the Basel Zoo " laughed " for the first time when it was
introduced to the bird house at an age of forty days (Wackernagel, op. cit.).
It might be that this artificially-raised bird had no opportunity to hear
the " laughing " of adults and therefore wasn't able to learn these sounds
earlier. The oldest of our three young ones left the nest-box for the
first time at an age of thirty-five days. On 9th April two of the young
Laughing Jackass left the nesting-tree. Already on nth, 13th and 15th
April, respectively, the next clutch of eggs--though infertile--was laid.
The three young ones were removed from the aviary in May because they
were chased by their parents. On 19th and 20th July the second brood
hatched in the same hollow tree. They opened their eyes at an age of

fifteen days which is nearly the same as the two weeks recorded in the
Basel chick (Wackernagel, op. cit.). They left the nest-box when they
were thirty-five days old. Afterwards the adult pair and one offspring
were sleeping in close contact on the same branch every night. The other
young one was sleeping somewhere apart. The adult female started to
attack the male quite severely in the middle of October. Therefore the
two young ones were removed. The female continued its attacks on the
male until they were separated.
The partners of our breeding pair have different coloured eyes: the male
having brown and the female greyish eyes. All three young of the first
and one of the second clutch also have brown eyes. However, the other
specimen of the second clutch has the same greyish-eyes as its mother.
One should know more material to be sure that this is actually a sexual
and not an individual difference.
Breeding data of the Kookaburra in captivity is quite well known from
observations made in the Zoological Gardens of Basel (Wackernagel,
1963), San Diego (Lint, 1962), Washington (Widman and Vorous, 1962)
and Zurich. In these four zoos of the Northern hemisphere egg-laying
took place in every month from January until August. We can conclude
from the papers mentioned above and from my own observations that the
usual clutch consists of two to three eggs laid on successive days or at
intervals of one to three days. Incubation period varies from twenty-three
(San Diego) to twenty-six days (Basel). Fledglings leave the nest-box at
the earliest in thirty days (San Diego) and at the latest in thirty-six days
(Basel).
Literally nothing seems to have been published on the breeding of the
Rothschild's Mynah (Leucopsar rothschildi). In the years of 1963 and
1964 we got three males and one female of this beautiful white starling
from the Island of Bali. They were always kept together, first in an
outside aviary and later in the open-fronted flight aviary.
Three young ones hatched after an incubation period of twelve days on
15th April, 1965. However, they all died as well as those hatched in
June of the same year, perhaps due to insufficient feeding. On 4th May,
1966, two young hatched in a nest-box. They left it for the first time at
an age of twenty-eight days and were eventually sold to another zoo.
Four young hatched on 19th July and on 7th September (after an incuba-
tion period of only ten days), respectively. Two of both broods dis-
appeared some days after hatching. One of two fledglings hatched on
17th February, 1967, was still being fed by its parents when again four
chicks hatched on 7th April. They all died although the older fledgling
was removed. Another clutch of four eggs was laid on 4th June by the
same female but they failed to hatch and no more breeding activity was
seen since--except the courtship display which can be observed every
day (see illustrations). It seems that the clutch of the Rothschild's
Mynah is normally composed of four eggs, however, usually only two of
the nestlings are raised successfully.

For several years we had tried to obtain the Australian Brolga Crane
(Grus rubicunda) but in spite of all our efforts it was only in October, 1967,
that we succeeded in getting a pair of this species which is seldom seen
in European Zoos. After having purchased six Hooded Cranes (Grus
monacha ) in March, we were able to buy another six of these rare birds.
They all share a vast enclosure with a group of Lesser Sandhill Cranes
and make a wonderful exhibit. In December we acquired in exchange a
fine female White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) as a mate for our single male.
In our crane collection now only two species of fourteen are lacking:
the Whooping Crane and the Black-necked Crane. In order to facilitate
the breeding of cranes we have begun to construct special breeding
enclosures. They are situated in a part of the Zoo which is not very
much frequented by the public, and will be densely planted with bushes
so that the birds will be undisturbed.
Four Guanay Cormorants were released in the enclosure of our huge
male Elephant Seal. At the very beginning they were somewhat afraid
of their neighbour but now they are getting accustomed to him. The
seal so far never tried to disturb the birds.
During the last four months of 1967, the following birds were purchased:

The Zoo was closed to the public from 25th November, 1967, to 3rd
February, 1968, due to the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic which has
been prevalent in this area. Due to the closure we restricted the move-
ment of birds and therefore no new arrivals were received during this
period. Since re-opening, we have been presented with a Senegal and
an African Grey Parrot.
On 31st December, 1967, the Bird Stocktake was completed. This is
rather difficult in the Tropical House, where the birds hide in the thick

Many additions were counted among the Cordon Bleus and Orange-
cheeked Waxbills; it was obvious that they had bred but due to the size
of the building, their nesting activities had gone unobserved. At the
Stocktaking we accounted for 924 birds of 261 species--a slight increase
in numbers but a slight drop in species, compared with last year's figures.
During 1967 a number of species have bred, notably Sclater's Crested

caledonicus manillevsis ), a Philippine Rail ( Rallus t. torquatus) and a
White-throated Kingfisher ( Halcyon smyrnensis gularis) brought from
Manila by Mrs. J. Laloe who also brought a Philippine Oriole ( Oriolus c.

Eagle, two female Capercaillie, a pair of Rose-crested or Moluccan
Cockatoos and a Lady Ross's Turaco.
The cockatoos are not tame and are devoted to one another, so there
should be a good chance of breeding from them.
Black-footed Penguins, Cereopsis Geese and Javan Fish-Owls are
nesting and another Speckled Pigeon has been bred. The pair of Pigmy
Falcons that nested last spring (one egg being seen in the nest) appear to
be nesting again now.

compared with the forty-three that flew north to their breeding grounds
in the Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, in the spring. This means 1
that there were nine young birds of the year. A recent report says that
one of the Aransas birds has died from gun-shot wounds. Six eggs were

Carter Bundy conceived the idea of establishing the Scarlet Ibis
(Eudocimus ruber) in Florida. If the White E. albus could live there, why
not the closely related Scarlet? Surely it was just a matter of taking a
few fertile eggs from one of the South American nesting sites and putting
them under brooding Whites? And so, with the co-operation of David
Moore, then Conservator of Forests and Chief Game Warden of Trinidad,
twenty-four Scarlet Ibis eggs were sent to him in North Miami Beach,
in July, 1961. Carter Bundy substituted them for an equal number of
White Ibis eggs in eleven nests in Greynolds Park. Within two weeks
seventeen of the Trinidad eggs hatched--at least four young ones survived.
In 1963, two of the Scarlets mated but hatched no young. Later, all
four mated with Whites and, eventually, two Scarlet-White pairs produced
a total of three young. The following year three nestings occurred. One
involved paired Scarlet birds and two involved Scarlet-White pairs.
Only two young from these matings survived the summer, and they
disappeared before it was possible to see what colour they became. In
1965 there were three Scarlet-White nestings and one Scarlet-Scarlet,
with a total production of six young. Then in the spring, 1966, a pink
Ibis was seen to be building a nest with a White mate: and a few days
later a richly salmon-coloured bird, also mated to a White one, appeared
in another part of the rookery: " The two were not immature; pink and
salmon were their permanent adult colors ". In 1967 one of the hybrids
mated with a White and two chicks were produced. The experiment has
been an undoubted success and Carter Bundy intends repeating it, if
possible on a larger scale. The foregoing is condensed from " New

volumes. Dover Publications, New York, 1967. Price $2.50 per
volume.
It is nearly a century since the last of the octavo editions of Audubon's
great work appeared in 1871, and all interested in ornithology and avicul-
ture will welcome the appearance of this new edition and at such a reason-
able price. The original edition of Birds of America, known as the elephant
folio edition, was described by Baron Cuvier as "the greatest monument ever
erected by Man to Nature ", and with its wonderful illustrations and very
limited edition of less than two hundred copies it is a valuable treasure
only to be seen in the larger museums and libraries. But even the black
and white illustrations to Audubon's original text emphasize the superiority
of art in giving a living impression of the birds he describes. Audubon's
literary style eventually became as animated and picturesque as his
illustrations, but as Dean Amadon remarks his memory occasionally
played him false in writing years later without the specimen before him.
The introduction to this Dover edition is written by Dean Amadon,
Lamont Curator of Birds, American Museum of Natural History, and
new indices have been specially compiled for this by John Bull, also of the
American Museum of Natural History. The common, and also the
scientific names of many of the birds have changed since Audubon
completed his work and these two new indices will be of great assistance
to the reader. In the first index the birds are arranged alphabetically by
the common name used by Audubon followed by the scientific name he
used and then, within brackets, the current common and scientific names.
In the second index the birds are arranged alphabetically by their current
common names, followed by their current scientific names and then,
within brackets, the corresponding names used by Audubon. The indices
will greatly help the reader of this new reprint of Audubon's important
text which is likely to remain the standard work on the subject for many
a long day.

NUTRITION OF HUMMING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998842357142857" page_id="56364380"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
I read with much interest the three letters in the January/February number of |
the Magazine on Humming Birds and nectar-drinkers and I would like to thank
Mr. Spilsbury for his very kind comments. How I wish I could condense my
views on nutrition in such a balanced and unbiassed way as Mr. Harrison! How- j
ever it seems from Mr. Hasting's letter that I am asked to answer so many questions
on so many matters that I hope you will allow me the space to do so. j
Regarding the first two questions raised (where did I obtain my first Humming
Birds and why did I not exhibit Humming Birds before 1962) like several other
aviculturists and bird fanciers since the War, I bought my first Humming Birds
from other dealers (Kingston's of Springfield Ltd. for one) and from private
sources via the Continent in the early 1950's before Mr. Hastings re-opened his
business. This I believe, was in 1953 and before he again advertised Humming
Birds for sale, which I think was in 1954. I kept Humming Birds some time before
I exhibited them but reference to the National Exhibition of Cage Birds Show
Catalogue for 1952 (ten years earlier than the date Mr. Hastings mentions in his
letter) will disclose that four Humming Birds were entered that year including
one of mine. I also showed a Humming Bird in other shows in 1952 including,
I recall, Beccles and Great Yarmouth where I was living at the time. I entered
Humming Birds in five other National Shows prior to 1962 and in many other
shows. In 1953 in particular I exhibited these birds at Felixstowe, Ipswich,
Norwich and Scunthorpe. Humming Birds are not the easiest of birds to take to
bird shows, particularly if these are any distance and I restricted my exhibits of
these birds to a few shows only in any year.
Mr. Hastings is again mistaken in suggesting I purchased a hen Violet-eared
Humming Bird from him " in the fall of 1965 " and that I bred from it. The
only Violet-eared Humming Bird I ever bought from him was on the 17th June,
1962. We tried to pair this bird with a cock of ours of the same species, but the
male would not tolerate it and we had to separate them before the newcomer was
injured. We sold this presumed hen to a friend very shortly afterwards. It
would have been a very old Humming Bird to have bred five years later!
On the matter of nutrition, I don't profess to be an expert. I stated the food I
find the most suitable for nectar-drinkers kept under the outdoor conditions
described in my previous letter. I am fully aware that no Humming Bird will live
on sugar alone for very long and that they require vitamins, minerals and proteins
to help balance their diet. In the case of my Humming Birds and other nectar-
drinkers (except lories which I have never kept) the vitamins, minerals and proteins
are supplied by the Gevral-Protein plus whatever fruit flies and other minute
insects they can catch on the wing and these are precious few in the winter months.
It is no good, therefore, belittling the nutritional value of the Gevral-Protein food
supplied and as Mr. Hastings has set out the analysis of molasses (which I presume
is one of the main ingredients in Stimulite Nectar Food), I hope I shall be allowed
to give a similar fair hearing to Gevral-Protein. My container label reads:

Whether the above vitamins, minerals and proteins exactly meet the needs of all
species of Humming Birds, I don't know. The nectar formula is not mine and
was prepared by a scientist who has kept Humming Birds for about 40 years and
has spent much of that time studying the nutritional requirements of these birds.
He assured me only a few months ago that at the moment, in his opinion, the nectar
formula I am using is the best available and from the general results I am getting,
I am quite satisfied.
Unfortunately, in December last, I lost the young Violet-eared Humming Bird
bred last March; it was almost 9 months old but had been in full breeding condition
for some time. I thought I would try and breed from it and placed within its
sight and hearing a newly purchased bird which I think is a hen. It is, of course,
of the same species. Shortly afterwards I found the young bird dead on the grass
floor of its aviary. It had never a moment's illness in its short life and as I wanted
to find the cause of its sudden death, I sent it at once to a veterinary surgeon I
know for a post-mortem. His report from which I quote said: " He (the Violet-
eared Humming Bird) was in perfect condition and I could find no sign of injury.
The cause of death was rupture of the right atrium of the heart ". I have dis-
cussed this with several avicultural friends since and have been told it is not
unusual to have fatalities of this sort with certain species of birds when in full
breeding condition. We had a similar case with a cock Minivet two summers ago,
the bird which we had had two years without a hen died instantly when we did
introduce one to its aviary.
Finally, I would say I am not the slightest bit interested in wagers of any sort,
nor do I wish to get involved in the experiments Mr. Hastings suggests; my
avicultural interests are much simpler. However, if Mr. Hastings wants to have
feeding trials carried out, let him go ahead; I am sure no one wants to stop him!

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid.
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not heresay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

(Lophura swinhoei)
By Philip Wayre (The Ornamental Pheasant Trust, Norfolk, England.)
Two species of pheasant, the Mikado (Syrmaticus mikado) and Swinhoe's
{Lophura swinhoei) are unique to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) and
both are considered to be in danger of extinction in the wild.
Swinhoe's Pheasant was discovered in 1862 by the English naturalist
Robert Swinhoe, at one time Consul in Taiwan. Despite several hazardous
journeys into the interior of the Central Mountain range, Swinhoe did
not succeed in seeing this pheasant alive in its natural habitat, although
he obtained skins from the aborigines. At that time these people were
still taking human scalps and their presence added to the problems of
travelling in the extremely rugged, wild and steep jungle with frequent
torrential rainstorms. Conditions are no better today except that the
aborigines are no longer hostile.
In 1959 two pairs of Swinhoe's Pheasants which had recently been
imported from Taiwan were presented to the Ornamental Pheasant
Trust at Great Witchingham by Mr. Arthur Prestwich. They were
probably the first birds to reach Europe alive since the original importa-
tion in 1866 and they provided a welcome change of blood. Since then
over 150 Swinhoe's Pheasants have been bred by the Trust, and in 1963
negotiations were started with the Government of Taiwan for sending a
number of birds for release in their native habitat to reinforce the depleted
wild population.
Preliminary arrangements for sending the first consignment of 30 birds
were made on behalf of the Trust by the British Section of the International
Council for Bird Preservation. Six pairs were to be released in a suitable
area of the Central Mountain range where this species still occurs in the
wild and the remainder were to be retained in captivity to form the
nucleus of the island's own captive breeding programme.
The birds were flown to Taiwan in April 1967, with the help of a
generous grant from the World Wildlife Fund and from two other
organizations. My wife and I arrived in Taipei at the same time to super-
vise their release and advise the Taiwan authorities on the captive breed-
ing programme so that further young birds would become available for
release to reinforce the wild population.

The pheasants were transferred from Taipei to the release pen, but as
they would need at least three weeks to become accustomed to their new
surroundings before it would be safe to set them free, we continued our
wildlife investigations. One of the first places we visited was the tourist
resort of Sun Moon Lake; many of the shops were full of stuffed birds
and mammals since these are popular household ornaments both in Japan
and in Taiwan. Animals caught all over the island are sent to Taipei for i
mounting but the majority end up for sale at Sun Moon Lake. Here the i
visitor can take his pick from mounted Barking Deer (Muntjac), Giant !
Red Flying Squirrels, White-headed Flying Squirrels, Ferret Badgers,
Pangolins and a wide variety of birds, including colourful Minivets, i
Orioles, Fairy Pittas, Blue Pies, Bulbuls, Barbets, White-throated
Laughing Thrushes, Shrikes, Sibias, Grass Owls, Serpent Eagles and
even a few Swinhoe's Pheasants. The volume of the slaughter is horrible i
to contemplate and this trade is clearly an unnecessary drain on the
wildlife of Taiwan.
Much of the island's wildlife ends up in the medicine shops of the
cities, because the Chinese believe in the medicinal or aphrodisiac qualities
of many species. Pangolins or Scaly Anteaters are hunted for their
scales, dried Sea Horses and Turtles are also in demand, other " remedies "
include the dried foetus of the Sambar, while the antler of the Sambar,
sawn off whilst in velvet, is a valued aphrodisiac though not considered
as effective as Rhino horn.
No European had ever seen Swinhoe's Pheasant in the wild and our
search for this bird finally took us to the aborigine village of Chulu,
where the chief promised to take me to a remote part of the mountain
behind his village to look for the pheasants.
On 18th May I met Chief Ho an hour before dawn and accompanied
by two of his men and three small hunting dogs we set off into the
mountains. All the men had guns, one of them home-made and the
others manufactured in Taiwan. They were single barelled, smooth bore
and about 20 gauge taking brass cartridges which could be re-loaded by
the hunters. The charge was lead shot of various sizes and the wadding
was rammed newspaper. In addition one of the men carried three large
steel traps for deer while the Chief had a bag containing some 200 snares
for pheasants. Normally a hunting trip of this kind lasts several days
and the men bivouac at night beneath rough bamboo shelters.
The jungle was dense with rich sub-tropical vegetation, creepers, tree
ferns and lily-like plants with huge glaucous leaves. The climb was very
steep and for some way the path, little more than J metre wide, ran along
the edge of a gorge with a sheer drop of over 100 metres to the river
below. There was considerable precipitation on the vegetation and the
path was often wet and slippery. Leeches were numerous and we stopped
every twenty minutes to pull them off our legs; the aborigines scraped
theirs off with sharp panga-type knives which they used to cut their way

through the vegetation. Our goal was a certain area where the Chief
said we ought to find Swinhoe's Pheasant and, after a gruelling six hour
climb we reached it. A huge fallen tree covered with spongey moss lay
I across the path, the undergrowth was waist high, but less impenetrable,
i and a green light filtered through the tree canopy overhead. We were
steaming hot and soaked to the skin with sweat and water which dripped
off the trees and bushes. The three little hunting dogs began to work
the mountainside and within half an hour had flushed seven Swinhoe's
Pheasants, which were probably members of one family group as they
, were all found in a comparatively small area. Chief Ho explained that
, the pheasants came here at this time of year to feed on the nut-like fruits
i of a certain tree.
None of the aborigines was able to get a shot at the pheasants as they
hurtled downhill between the trees and despite all the efforts of the little
dogs, no more were seen. The altitude was approximately 800 metres.
Other mammals seen were the Formosan Red-bellied Tree Squirrel
(Callosciurus erythraeus centralis ), Formosan Macaque ( Macaca cyclopis)
and Formosan Muntjac ( Muntiacus reevesi micrurus). Birds included the
1 Formosan Serpent Eagle (Spilornis cheela hoy a), Formosan Lesser Coucal
(Centropus bengalensis lignator ), Formosan Tree-pie ( Crypsirina formosae
formosae) and the Formosan Bamboo Partridge (. Bambusicola thoracica
! sonorivox), the latter at 200 metres in a bamboo grove.
The steel traps used for catching deer are also used by the aborigines
for taking monkeys which they eat. The men showed us a rocky cliff
across the gorge where they told us they trapped the monkeys (Formosan
Macaques) which gather here during the rains. In a nearby village we
saw a Macaque chained to a tree outside a shop, one front leg had been
amputated at the elbow, presumably in a similar trap.
The snares used by the aborigines to catch pheasants and partridges are
simple but effective. The noose is made of thin cord and is held open
by a sliver of bamboo (17 cms. long for partridges, 23 cms. long for
pheasants) to one end of which the noose is tied, the loop then passes
through a notch in the other end of the sliver and hangs beneath it. The
bamboo is also the trigger, for it is attached to a strong sapling bent over
to act as a spring holding the sliver in place beneath a notch cut in a peg
which has been hammered into the ground. The snare is almost invisible
when set across a pheasant run and when a bird puts its head through
the noose it dislodges the bamboo sliver and the sapling then whips it up
into the air, where it hangs by its neck. Needless to say, most of the
pheasants caught by this method are dead by the time the hunters find
them.
From our enquiries, it appears that Swinhoe's Pheasant is generally,
but thinly, distributed in the central mountain range behind Taitung.
This is a very large area, much of which is almost inaccessible. If the
aborigines could be prevented from shooting or snaring it the future of

this species would seem to be reasonably secure, unless the human
population increases to such an extent that the habitat is destroyed by
felling and clearing the jungle.
On our return to Hsitou to supervise the release of the pheasants we
were told that following our conversations with Governor Huang Cheh
he had decided to ask the Government to pass a new law giving full
protection to the Swinhoe's Pheasant. Even if this results only in stop-
ping the trade in skins and live birds it will do much to safeguard the
species in its remote mountain home.
The latest news from Taiwan is that the Government has recently I
extended legal protection to more than forty species of mammals and
birds in the island, including the Swinhoe's Pheasant. Meanwhile our
birds have settled down well in their new home and the operation appears
to have every chance of success. Plans are being made to send a second
consignment of young Swinhoe's for release in the same area in the near :
future.
The Trust is at present working on a similar project to reinforce the &apos;
small wild population of the very rare Mikado Pheasant in Taiwan. Work
has also begun on a scheme to reintroduce the Cheer Pheasant to its
original range in the N.W. Himalayas, where, it too, is threatened with &apos;
extinction. Preliminary negotiations with the Government of Himachal
Pradesh are already under way and it is hoped to send the first consign-
ment of young birds within the next two years.
The immediate practical results of these operations demonstrate the
value of aviculture in helping to save threatened species. However, it
may well be that the side effects are of even greater importance if they |
succeed in calling the attention of governments concerned to the plight 1
of their native wildlife and thus cause them to take action, as has already
been done in the case of Taiwan. In some cases legislation, even if it i
becomes law, may be difficult to enforce, but it is a step in the right
direction and one which will ultimately determine the future of much of
the world's wildlife.

By J. R. Hodges (Pinner, Middlesex, England)
Of the four species of the genus Cyanoramphus two have recently
become well known to European aviculturists. These are the Red-
fronted or Red-crowned New Zealand Parrakeet ( Cyanoramphus
novaezelandiae) and the smaller Yellow-fronted or Yellow-crowned
, species (C. auriceps).
The Yellow-fronted species was represented in some of the larger
collections in Europe before the war. It was reputed to be a prolific
, breeder but not very long lived in captivity. Many years previously the
Red-fronted Parrakeet was a comparatively common aviary bird but it is
i doubtful if there were any specimens at all in Europe from 1914 until a
year or two ago. At one time both species were common New Zealand
wild birds, but their unpopularity with farmers led to their relentless
j persecution almost to the point of extinction. Recently the position has
; improved and now the Red-fronted species is well established on many
New Zealand coastal and outlying islands, where it breeds in hollow trees
j and some times in rock crevices. The Yellow-fronted species occurs in
fair numbers on the mainland in both the North and South Islands. For
many years it was an offence in New Zealand to keep any species of native
bird in captivity but about ten years ago the authorities recognised the
\ part that aviculture could play in conserving species threatened with
extinction. Accordingly the Department of Internal Affairs issued to
j several individuals permits to keep C. auriceps and C. novaezelandiae
provided that their aviaries were considered satisfactory and of suitable
size and were open to occasional inspection. The experiment has been a
; great success and during the past ten years rapidly increasing numbers
of both species have been bred annually. Some of the progeny found
their way to Australian aviaries where they also became firmly established
and presumably it is from this source that most of the specimens now in
Europe have originated.
I obtained a magnificent pair of Red-fronted Parrakeets in June 1967.
They are much bigger than I expected, the cock being larger than an
average sized Rosella Parrakeet and the hen not much smaller. Their
general colour is a lovely deep shade of green. The forehead, crown and
a stripe from the forehead extending to a patch behind the eye are crimson.
There is also a patch of the same colour on each side of the rump. The
primaries are violet-blue. The upper and lower mandibles are bluish-
grey, darker at the tips. They have long sturdy legs and feet which they
use with great dexterity for scratching, holding and running. They are
extremely active and have a direct and rapid flight. They look partic-
ularly attractive when, with their tails spread like a fan, they swoop up
from the ground to alight on a perch.

82 J. R. HODGES-THE RED-FRONTED NEW ZEALAND PARRAKEET
After a short quarantine period the pair were placed in one of the out-
door aviaries of a friend with whom I share my small collection of parra-
keets. The aviary is a conventional one consisting of an enclosed shelter,
a covered and an open flight. The length of the flight is only eight feet
and I felt that the aviary, which was intended for Grass Parrakeets, was
too small. However, the Cyanoramphus parrakeets are constantly on the
move and are so active that they appear to get adequate exercise in a
comparatively confined space.
Since the birds were recently imported and had been placed outside
only late in the summer it was intended not to allow them to breed until the
following year. However, they had other ideas and the hen began to lay
numerous eggs on the floor of the aviary shelter. A hastily constructed
nest-box about i ft. high x 9 in. wide x 9 in. deep was hung in the open
flight. This was adopted immediately and the hen laid ten eggs, usually
on alternate days, on a few handfuls of rotten wood in the bottom of the
box. Incubation commenced after the third egg had been laid and six
chicks were hatched about three weeks later. The chicks which were
covered with grey down grew rapidly. All six were fully reared and they
left the nest about six weeks after hatching. Both parents fed the young-
sters in the nest-box and after they had learnt to fly and although the
young were capable of looking after themselves within a fortnight of
leaving the nest, the parents continued to feed them occasionally for
several weeks more. The family group was left together for a couple of
months without the youngsters coming to any harm. They became very
tame and steady and were, from their shape of head and breadth of beak,
quite obviously three cocks and three hens.
In their natural habitat Red-fronted Parrakeets are known to feed on
the seeds, flowers and leaves of many wild plants. They also eat small
grubs and insects. In captivity they appear to do well on a mixture of
canary, millet, white and small striped sunflower seeds to which has been
added a little hemp. They are very fond of fruit and green food and ours
are given apples and green food (if available) every day. They particularly
like fresh turves of which they eat the stalks and roots of grass and pre-
sumably all the insects they can find. One turf keeps them fully occupied
until it is completely demolished.
When the pair were feeding their chicks they ate enormous quantities of
plain canary seed but completely ignored millet sprays and the millet
in their seed mixture. They also ate soaked sunflower seeds, one large
slice of white bread soaked in milk daily and considerable amounts of
groundsel of which they consumed the leaves, stalks and flowers and which
they preferred to any other form of green food.
The Red-fronted Parrakeet is a delightful aviary inhabitant. In
addition to its beauty and attractive mannerisms it is hardy, easy to keep,
easy to breed and extremely intelligent. On one occasion the feeding
hatch of the aviary of the adult pair was accidently left open. Within

C. J. O. HARRISON--PAINTED QUAILS &amp; INTERSPECIFIC ALLOPREENING 83
seconds both the male and the female were apparently enjoying their new-
found freedom and exploring the neighbourhood. After about half an
hour's exercise during which they came off worse in an altercation with
the local Blackbirds, they flew back to the garden. They found their
aviary with no difficulty, even though it is one in a group of identical
compartments, and returned sedately through the feeding hatch.
Perhaps their over-anxiety to reproduce themselves can be a dis-
advantage as we discovered recently. The adult hen came into breeding
condition again early in January of this year, laid several eggs without
apparent difficulty but was picked up dead one morning after the tempera-
ture had fallen during the night to 20 *F. Post-mortem examination
showed, as was expected, that death was caused by egg binding. It is
easy to be wise after the event but the female should have been taken in for
the remainder of the winter when it became so anxious to nest in the
worst possible weather conditions. Another tragedy occurred with the
sudden development of paralysis of the legs and wings of one of the young
cocks. This bird, which weighed no gm., died within 24 hours, but the
cause of death was not apparent at autopsy. The other youngsters are
now six months old and hardly distinguishable from their parents.
There were, in this country, other breeding successes with this species
in 1967. Mr. A. V. Marques raised several and two more were reared in
Lady Baillie's aviaries. Other successful breedings have probably
occurred and it may not be long before this species is more readily obtain-
able. It certainly makes a charming addition to any parrakeet collection.

PAINTED QUAILS AND INTERSPECIFIC
ALLOPREENING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996128" page_id="56364403"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
In a recent note J. Trollope (1968) has described interspecific allopreen-
ing ( = " mutual" preening) between Painted Quails {Excalfactoria
chinensis) and other species of birds. He examined the possibility that
pattern might provide the stimulus for the behaviour but concluded that
it did not, and thought that the clumping together which also occurred
was not due to a need for warmth.
The probable explanation for this type of behaviour has been given by
D. Morris (1956) in a paper on feather postures. Morris was intrigued
by the persistence with which Java Sparrows ( Padda oryzivora) would
clump with, and allopreen, resting Barbary Doves (Streptopelia
roseogrisea ), a fact also noted by D. Goodwin (1952). After examining
the evidence Morris came to the conclusion that the stimulus which
elicited clumping and allopreening behaviour from birds in general was
the sight of a bird in a fluffed and immobile posture. The doves, by
adopting such a posture when resting, and by virtue of the fact that their

size made them a much more obvious signal, provided a supernormal
stimulus and were preened by some of the Java Sparrows in preference to
members of their own species.
In aviaries the Painted Quail provides just the same kind of supernormal
stimulus for smaller birds, particularly solitary ones which are accustomed
to reciprocal allopreening as a part of their normal social behaviour, but
which lack suitable mates and are therefore more likely to respond to
such a stimulus. For this type of association to occur the second in-
dividual should be of another species in which allopreening naturally
occurs and, as far as is known (Harrison 1965), the Painted Quail is the
only member of the Phasianidae that regularly shows this behaviour.
Since Morris found that Java Sparrows would also try to clump with much
larger pigeons, the fact that Trollope's birds ignored the larger Quail
suggests that they had learned to do so after receiving an adverse response
from a member of a species that would not normally recognise this
attention. It is possible, however, that the supernormal visual signal to
which a bird will react has an optimum size in relation to the size of the
bird responding to it, and that Harlequin Quail, (Coturnix delagorgei ) and
Rain Quail (C. coromandelica) are too large in relation to waxbills.
The Painted Quail not only permits other birds to preen it but will also
preen in return. My own records of interspecific preening by this
species refer to a solitary male in an aviary at the London Zoo which was
seen to preen the head of a resting Rain Quail that appeared too drowsy
to protest; and also to preen the throat of a solitary White-eared Bulbul
(Pycnonotus leucogenys ). The last individual had also been observed
soliciting preening from various other birds in the aviary without success.

The Queen Carola's Parotia {Parotia carolae [Meyer]) is a Bird-of-
Paradise that lives in Central New Guinea from Weyland to Sepik Moun-
tains, from 4,000 to 6,ooo ft. (Rand and Gilliard 1967). The male is
predominately velvety-black with an area of white and buff on the flanks.
These lighter areas are, however, not easily seen unless the bird is in
flight or displaying. The feathering about the head, throat and chest is
both colourful and intricate and is best described by the illustrations.

parts, with pale ochaceous underparts barred with black. A broad
greyish-white stripe is conspicuous above and below the eye. When
directly behind the hen peculiar " ear tufts " were noticed. These are
elongated feathers behind the eye which are erected now and then.
A male and female were observed for two full days the ist and 2nd of
October 1967 at Chester Zoo, Cheshire. The birds were in an indoor
aviary approximately 7 ft. x 14 ft. x 8 ft., the rear third of which formed
the shelter. The floor of both shelter and flight was covered with a thick
carpet of peat, there were ample perches and foliage. The house was
heated and no artificial light was used.
I started my observations at about 10 a.m. At this time both birds
were preening themselves, occasionally flying down to feed. After
feeding intense bill wiping was performed and preening continued.
Both birds were seen to clean their feet and toes by running the mandibles
either side of them and picking between the toes. Scratching of the nape
and ear-coverts was performed by the " overwing method " but the male
was seen to scratch the throat directly.
Shortly after midday the cock began singing. First notes to be heard
were soft twitterings and clucking uttered when he was close to the female.
These calls were soon interrupted by an extremely loud and resounding
" Kuck Kurrk " repeated two or three times. During this call the bill
was lifted upward and the neck stretched, (Fig. 2) the crest was slightly
erected.
Fig. 2.--During the call the bill is lifted upward and the neck stretched.
At approximately 1 p.m. the male started displaying, beginning with
rather simple performances which became progressively complicated. I
shall describe the displays in the sequence in which they appeared, a
similar pattern being observed on both days. All displays took place
with both birds on specific horizontal perches the male 5 ft. from the
ground, the female 18 in. above him at " 2 o'clock ".
The first display was performed twice, lasting about 15 seconds on each
occasion. The male flew to his display perch, turned away from the hen
and crouched, displaying the white flank plumes by lifting them over the

primaries. After this display several minutes passed, both birds remaining
on their perches and preening. The male then performed a second type
of display, repeated at short intervals. Hopping up opposite the female
and " sideways facing " changing from one position to the other very
rapidly the feet leaving the perch each time the position was changed.
(Fig- 3 )-
Fig. 3. --Sideways facing display.
Approximately ten minutes of preening followed the second display
and then the male appeared to prepare himself on his perch below the
female, watching her intently and making slight intention movements.
Suddenly he broke into another display. Head up and back toward the
female he swayed rhythmically from side to side and fluttered his wings
only slightly but very rapidly (Fig. 4). During this performance the
silver crests were parted and the golden-bronze feathers erected between
them, lowered again and the outside crests closed. This movement of
the head feathers was continuously and rapidly repeated, flashing silver,
gold, silver, gold, in quick succession.

Another short preening period followed and then display, somewhat
similar to the last, was given. Back once again to the hen the cock
bobbed vigorously up and down, stretching the body upward with stiff
legs then crouching, then up again. The wings were fluttered as in the
previous display, but they were occasionally opened to their full extent
at the stretching position. (Fig. 5). During this performance, as in the
last, the crests were moved as previously described.
%
Fig. 5.--$ = Position from which female observed display.
Almost ten minutes of intense preening by the male then took place,
both birds remaining on their perches. The male then performed a very
quick " intention bob " and broke into what I assume to be typical high
intensity display.
The pre-display bob was a quick jerk, the bill pointing downward and
the tail flicked upward the wings were flicked very slightly and the flank
plumes were brought out. The bird then raised himself to an upright
stance and put all his display feathering to use. The elongated breast
and flank feathers were raised, over the wings, to form a complete skirt
meeting over the centre of the back. Crest feathering was in continuous
movement as in previous displays, but the six wires were raised, separated
and held in front of the bird (Fig. 6). The throat feathers were flickering
continuously, these and the crests being the only parts to move once the
display posture was attained. This display lasted 90 seconds, during which ,
time the birds did not move on their perches. The display ended as
suddenly as it started, with the wires, crests and skirt all flicked back to
the normal positions.
Once again a period of preening, by the male, followed, but this time
he continuously moved the crest as in the displays. The last described

display was once again performed this time lasting only 20 seconds at the
end of which the female flew down beside the male, hung upside down,
looked at him and fluttered to the ground.
This short display was followed by fifteen minutes of disturbance
between the birds. The male would prepare himself for display below
the hen, the hen fly off her perch and the cock chase her about until she
returned to it. Then the male displayed once again. This by the
performance was very short lasting only 9 or 10 seconds, but was observed,
female from between her legs (Fig. 7).

The final display I witnessed took place at about 5 p.m., six minutes
after the preceding one. This was a very long and intense display,
(almost five minutes) the first half of which was watched by the hen from
between her legs and the rest from an upright position. Once again
the " pre-display bob " then the display. This time the male moved
whilst in full display side-stepping along his perch and up the adjoining
branch, and back again, covering some 2^-3 ft. in all. When back at the
original point he flew up to the hen, stretched over her and gave the
resounding call.

It is worthy of note that what was observed was a series of displays
becoming progressively more intricate as the afternoon continued. I can
find no detailed account of this species displaying in the wild. However
there are several accounts of the other members of this genus, but only
displays similar to the final one (Fig. 6) were seen performed to the female.
It is possible that in the wild, the preceding displays that I observed
are either territorial, or pre-breeding season displays.
It is generally stated that the parotias clear a display area and perform on
the forest floor, only occasionally displaying on a perch. However the
cock bird observed rarely alighted on the ground and certainly did not
remove debris. In contrast the male Lawe's Six-wired Parotia (P. lawesi)
in the adjoining aviary was continuously clearing an area of tiny particles.
As my observations suggest that this species displays above ground,
not on it, it seems pertinent to mention here the only apparent evidence
to the contrary. Gilliard (1961) was shown what he assumed to be the
" bower " of this species. He did not see the bird at the discovered
bower but observed an adult male which flew into the area in response to
the distress calls of a Cuckoo-Shrike. Later, however, he saw this bird
displaying on the ground beneath a bush in an aviary at Honolulu, where
he had sent it. Thus the question of whether this bird clears a display
place and displays on the ground in a wild state is still open. It is possible
that either the male I observed, or Gilliard's injured specimen, might have
chosen an unnatural or unusual display level owing to some adverse
factor(s) of their captivity.

The Indus is one of the great rivers of India, rising in the Himalayas
it flows over the great alluvial plains of Upper India, over the desert sands
of Sind until it reaches the Sukkur Gorge. Here its waters are held, but
not impounded, by the Sukkur Barrage and thence, led by great canals
which flow to left and right, by ever lessening channels until the life-giving
waters reach the cultivated fields so that verily the desert blossoms like
the rose. Along its length the water attracts the birds so that for the
bird-lover the scene is one of ever changing interest. The great Black
and White Kingfisher is ever conspicuous as with fast-beating wings it
hovers over the water until it dives and retrieves its fish. The attractive
little sandpipers run ever before one, teal fly suddenly from the reed beds
and turtles bask in the sun upon small floating logs.
When in the Monsoon, say from June to October, the great river is in
flood; its waters, swollen by the heavy monsoon rains and the melting
Himalayan snows; if the canal embankments hold, the waters spread over
the desert sands and receding leave great lakes of shallow water which we
call dhands. Then the Mohanos, a caste of fine men and women, the
fishermen of the rivers, erect their large reed huts by the edges of the
dhands, now full of tiny fish which they feed to the white Egrets which
they have domesticated, much as the South African farmers have domesti-
cated the Ostrich, and for much the same purpose, the harvest of the
plumes. The Mohanos, like many other fishermen, are poor and the sale
of the plumes enabled them to add materially to their meagre incomes
and helped to mitigate the rigours of their hard lives.
There was no cruelty in this. The procedure was as follows. In the
large reed huts which served as spacious cages or pens the ground was
covered with rice straw gathered from the neighbouring irrigated fields.
The hen egrets would be placed in these pens and in very close company
they would make their simple nests of straw on the ground and lay their
eggs. The cocks were kept in sufficient numbers, outside the harem, to
fertilize the eggs. When hatched, the young birds would be taken and
reared by hand and in the following spring the nuptial plumes would be
gathered from these birds. So tame were the birds that on the beating
of an old enamel basin they would come running like so much poultry
to be fed. There is no cruelty in this. At the base of the neck whence
come these lovely plumes there is a small round patch of soft feathers.
These were plucked. The lovely nuptial plumes would come where these
soft feathers had been growing and I was told that if the birds were well
fed there could be two or three pluckings a year. One crop of nuptial
plumes would succeed another. The plumes must be ripe before plucking
and I was told that if there was one drop of blood the plucking would be
postponed. I was shown one bird which I was told was ten years old.

I could well believe it. This harmless and indeed beneficient trade was
now threatened.
It was a far cry from the reed huts by the Indus to the forests and
mountains of New Guinea and the forests and rivers of South America
but soon all were to be linked in a common fate, the innocent with the !
guilty, the just with the unjust. For a time I had been hearing what they
call in India a " thick rumour " that the keeping of Egrets for the gathering
of their plumes was to be forbidden. It was indeed true but only
indirectly. I write of many years ago, in the years 1916-17 when as a
young district officer I had been posted to Upper Sind. At that time the
motor car had not invaded our remote country districts. Our proper
transport was the camel and the horse. Even now I remember how I
took my favourite riding camel, a fast and elegant beast, so light fawn as
to be near white. We called her Rebecca. I will not tell you why and
we made a great fuss of her and fed her on molasses and on rai, the yellow
mustard which was grown in great quantities as oil seed and the beauty of
its yellow flowers used in the spring to light up the whole countryside,
while from the cover of the young green wheat the migrant Quail on their
passage to the far north-west would repeatedly call. Such is the wonder
of migration. I did not take my driver with me for, good fellow as he
was, when he perspired there was a strong smell of the great unwashed.
Indeed, sometimes I used to think I would steal a few hairs from the
black curls at the nape of his neck and pop them in a test tube and when I
was homesick for Sind I would take out the cork and sniff. But I never did.
I was determined if I could, to save tame and farm-bred birds and the
small profit they yielded to our hard pressed Mohanos. So early one
morning I rode to one of the farms and photographed the hen birds sitting
on their eggs, the young being reared by hand, and the reed huts standing |
by the flood waters of the Indus. It would, I thought, be possible to
distinguish the plumes of the tame and farm-bred birds and the plumes of
the wild birds of the forests of South America slaughtered so mercilessly.
It was my idea that the farms might be licensed as also the exporters and j
importers. I sent copies of the photographs to the proper authorities but
all in vain. It may be difficult after the passage of all these years to 1
appreciate the scandalous proportions of this iniquitous traffic in bird skins
and feathers. Thousands of skins of the lovely Birds of Paradise were
exported and the birds brought close to extinction for the profit of the
trader and for the adornment of one of the most extraordinary of human
inventions--the woman's hat. I heard that those in authority, and they
may well have been right, were of the opinion to license our farms was
to open a loophole for the evasion of the ban. So the importation of
plumes was forbidden and the greater preservation and domestication of
one of our most lovely birds was by so much impeded and the Mohanos
lost the means of mitigating the harshness of their lives.
I have often been impressed by the close association of the Indian (now

also the Pakistani) with animal and bird life. Many a time as I have been
travelling in one of the flat bottomed boats along a canal the boatman
would draw out from under the wooden seat a tame pond heron which he
would feed with a few small fish he had brought for that purpose. On
the great river boats which were moored to the banks of the Indus at
Sukkur, I have seen the Grey Heron and the larger White Egret tethered
by the leg to a pole projecting from the sides of the boat, catching small
fish, as the river flowed by. In the well of one of these large boats I
would see at times a number of tethered otters quietly resting which would
later help the fishermen to take the fish driven by them into the nets,
stretched from one side to the other of one of the narrower canals. It
would never occur to anyone to chase and kill for sport one of these active
and intelligent animals. I have thought that there existed in this far
country a community of life between animal and man which civilization
in other countries has destroyed. We should indeed, I suppose, be
grateful that the elite of our young manhood does not ride forth on
Sundays on bicycles, clad in their most colourful garments, and suitably
or unsuitably armed, to do battle with Thrushes, Skylarks and Gold-
finches and other small song birds, whose gentle bodies after appropriate
preparation, they will devour. I have read, though I do not believe all
I read, even when it confirms my own prejudices, that the lovely little
Ortolan is netted and fattened and devoured by gourmets, who covering
their heads with table napkins (not the other variety) to keep in the
delicate aroma, devour these tender morsels, so exquisitely and expertly
prepared with wine. On the other hand the ceremonies of the 12th of
August may seem to some people quite remarkable.
The domestication of animals and birds has been a matter of great
antiquity and importance in the history of man. I find it a strange and
humbling thought that many of us rely for nourishment and support on
the mammalian products of the cow and the ovarian products of the hen
and of the slaughter house. The Canary and the Budgerigar comparatively
recently domesticated have given to many kind-hearted persons, surely a
sub-species of Homo sapiens , the great predator, to be encouraged, many
hours of simple and kindly pleasure. " The man who keeps Canaries is a
kindly sort of man Is there any reason why the domestication of
song birds under proper conditions should not be encouraged and succeed?
I have a much treasured book by a French Historian, Jules Michelet.
It is called simply " The Bird " and was published in 1895 in London by
Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons of Paternoster Row. It is for me, alas, dated by
a label appropriately decorated, on the inside cover, with a quaint citation
reciting that it is a prize awarded in June, 1901, "for good conduct,
diligence and attention to lessons ". Thus have the years fled, but on
page 307 of the book occurs a passage which for the elegance of its style
and thought, deserves repetition, "To recreate all the conditions of abode,
food, vegetable environment and the harmonies of every kind which shall

deceive the exile into forgetfulness of his country is not only a scientific
question but a task of ingenious invention. To determine the limit of
slavery, of freedom, of alliance and collaboration with ourselves, proper
for each individual creature, is one of the gravest subjects which can
occupy us. A new art is this nor shall you succeed in this without a moral
gravity, a refinement of appreciation which at present are scarcely under-
stood and shall exist, perhaps only, when Woman undertakes those
scientific studies from which she has hitherto been excluded. This art
suppose a tenderness unlimited in justice and wisdom ". Dated and
quaint this may be but it contains much truth. Witness the recent breed-
ing of a Humming Bird by one of our members of the requisite sex.
Indeed over the years I have found birds thrive best when they are &apos;
tame and cared for with the tenderness which is a compensation for their
captivity. I have written about the Grey Partridge or Francolin of India,
which when reared from a chick, often by a shepherd boy, will outvie in
confidence and tameness the domestic hen and will in its proper season
sit quietly on her nest in the corner of a room in the mudhouse where the
gardener takes his meals with his family; and the contentment of the
garden reigns all around. Indeed many birds, even if not so apt for
domestication as the Zebra finch or the Sharp-tailed or Striated Munia
from which that classic example of domestication from the Far East, the
Bengaleese, is descended, will thrive if not kept in too large a cage (and
the old fanciers knew much about this) away from draughts and properly
fed and in a proper temperature, which, if in these islands, will be the
temperature at which we humans feel comfortable; and with access to the
life-giving rays of the early morning sun. I have found in India and
indeed in this country, small finches thrive best in all-wire cages. An
Indian friend and I made many cages in the fashion of bamboo cages but
of wood and wire. Packing cases and rolls of galvanized wire were our
raw material and with these we made cages in which we bred Red Avadavats
and Green Avadavats and St. Helena Waxbills and others, ejusdem generis.
We were at a disadvantage with the native craftsman, and I use this
epithet with the greatest admiration and respect, because we could not
use our toes as fingers.

For what ever value it may have for those interested in the propagation
of shore birds, may I pass along my recent experiences with an injured
member of the above named species, alternately known as " red-back ",
and by the uncomplimentary name of " simpleton Discovered unable
to fly on the winter beach, the bird found itself an unwilling traveller in my
back-pack for the hike back to the jeep. Upon closer examination the
creature proved to be suffering from a broken wing, the result, I'm sure,
of gunners' shot.
Upon arrival home, the Dunlin was placed in a roomy observation cage,
well lit, but screened off with cardboard to eliminate disturbance, and
offered a pan of tepid water containing io drops of Avi-tron a vitamin
supplement. The close-to-constant observation of its' behaviour by my
wife Pat and I proved that the bird was not in shock. The eyes were
clear, and the bird alert, although some what emaciated. For lack of
anything else, a mixture of chopped raw beef, crab meal, and vitamins

was offered, from which the bird fed only with mild interest. Later,
maggots and live tubifex worms were fed in the water and the shore bird
then began to feed in ernest. The immediate feeding of live food is, in
my view, an essential part of the acclimating of wild adult shore birds.
In the following days, the ever-popular meal worm was added to the
diet for protein, and was readily accepted, and subsequent examination
showed the bird to be fattening up nicely. It began to bathe in the water
pan and take dust baths, and slowly regained limited use of the injured
wing. The broken member was not touched, as it remained in a near
natural position, even when the bird was captured.
The Dunlin appears to be a rather tame, confiding shore bird, and as
such would lend itself to captive propagation, should the need for these
studies arise. They have, in the United States, suffered great losses at
the hands of market gunners in the past, but are recovering in moderate
numbers. I am sure the bird is not often seen in captivity, even in zoos,
so much research is to be done regarding their habits. The most oft
displayed action on the part of this individual was a frequent pivoting and
a seeming displacement action of feeding on bill stabbing motions.
On the 2nd of February the bird was consigned to the Philadelphia Zoo,
8 days after its' capture. I submit this information in the event it may
assist anyone picking up a similar member of this family in distress.

MEYER'S PARROT

<bodyText confidence="0.9661445" page_id="56364416"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
By V. Dilwyn Jones (Llandrindod Wells, Wales)
For a number of years I have been keenly interested in the small
parrots and from time to time I have kept and tried to breed Senegals
[Poecephalus senegalus), Meyer's [Poecephalus meyeri) and Ruppell's
(Poecephalus ruppelli).
My Senegals laid on several occasions but the eggs were never fertile
and ultimately, when my acclimatized hen died, I gave them up.
I had a very nice pair of Ruppell's, but both died during a very hard
winter and I have never been able to replace them.
At the same time, I had a reputed pair of Meyer's, but nearly two years
passed without any result. The birds seemed quite friendly, but the
one which I then thought was a hen (but which I now think may have been
an immature cock bird) died and again I gave up hope of breeding results.
By a fortunate coincidence, within a couple of weeks I saw a Meyer's
hen advertised and I purchased her, although when she arrived I was
very disappointed. She was a rather miserable specimen and a more
than usual clumsy flier, but the red iris was quite distinctive and I there-
fore decided to put the birds together in one of my smallest aviaries.

This was in 1962, but by the Spring of 1964 the hen had very greatly
improved and when I saw my original cock bird feeding her I felt
heartened, as this indicated that at least I had a true pair.
By this time the birds were in a small outside unheated aviary, about
twelve feet by four feet and six feet high, built at the snug and sunny
corner of the north and west walls of my garden. The nesting-log was a
pseudo tree trunk, three feet six inches high and sixteen inches in diameter.
The hen went to nest shortly afterwards and laid four eggs, but all were
infertile.
In 1965 she laid four eggs again and this time two young were hatched,
but both died before leaving the nesting-log.
In the late Spring of 1966, the hen went to nest again, but for fear of
upsetting her I did not risk a " peep " for some weeks, and when I did
look into the log there were three chicks and one infertile egg. I had a
quick " peep " from time to time and all the youngsters seemed to be
progressing well.
They came out of the nesting-log at intervals of about three or four
days and were flying (albeit clumsily) with their parents until the Spring
of 1967, when I placed them together in the small aviary where they still
are--being, I am fairly sure, two cocks and a hen.
When they emerge, the youngsters are of a very attractive green brown
colour with plain dark brown heads. The shoulder patches are much
smaller than in adult birds.
Incidentally, it seems very hard to sex young Meyer's in their baby
plumage and it seems to me that they do not attain full maturity until
at least two years old. The youngest of the three has only now the
beginnings of head markings.
In 1967, I had an early hatch of three more youngsters (which are still
doing well) and the hen went to nest again in September of that year.
Three more youngsters were hatched, but all of these died during the
past winter, which has been very severe here--we are about seven hundred
and fifty feet above sea level.
I am now left with eight of these very nice little parrots--my original
pair, two cocks and one hen bred in 1966 and three of my first 1967 clutch,
believed to be two cocks and a hen.
I am keeping one of the 1967 cock (?) birds in a roomy cage in my bird
room, but I very much doubt whether it will make a good pet.
The incubation period seems to be about a month, but the chicks
remain in the nesting log for about six or seven weeks.
My Meyer's are fed on sunflower, hemp, canary, melon rind, sweet
apple, monkey nuts and green food of various kinds, including dandelion,
spinach etc. They are also very fond of the berries of Mountain Ash and
Hawthorn.
When there were chicks in the log, I gave the parents soaked bread
(squeezed nearly dry) sprinkled with Bemax.

BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES AMONG CAPTIVE
MALAYSIAN WREATHED HORNBILLS

Malaysian wreathed Hornbills (Aceros u. undulatus): males--black with
chestnut head and crest, blue-gray bare-skin throat patch, white tail,
wrinkled casque; females are all black with white tails.
Of the 19 specimens of Malaysian Wreathed Hornbills I have obtained
while collecting for zoos, eight were wild-caught adults and 11 were
obtained as nestlings and hand-raised. Without exception, the hand-
raised specimens were consistently gentle birds even into adulthood;
however, all but two (both males) of the wild-caught adult birds were
extremely aggressive. Four of the wild-caught adults were released
when they refused to eat for five consecutive days, and two died from
undetermined causes within 20 days of their capture. All of the nestlings
were reared and (to the best of my knowledge) are still alive.
Specimens were collected in Malaysia (the states of Sabah, Selangor,
Kedah, and Melaka) and Sumatra. They are not particularly common in
any of these areas, but are more frequently seen than the similar Blyth's
Wreathed Hornbill {Aceros plicatus subruficollis). One pair (male and
female) of the fairly rare Bushy-crested Hornbill {Anorrhinus galeritus
carinatus) was obtained from a young Malay who had shot the parents
for eating, and hand-raised the young birds as pets. (At least this was his
story). They were obtained in the north-western part of the Malaysian
state of Johore.
The hand-raised Wreathed Hornbills generally retained their desire
for being hand-fed until they attained the average age of seven months.
At this time they were mature appearing birds that would incessantly
gape for feeding. When they were housed more than one per enclosure,
they would line up on a perch and noisily wait to be fed. They did not
appear to take the same order each feeding, but each waited his turn.
By the time they were starting to eat on their own, they could consume
two mice, one or two bananas, and a half-pound of lumpy insectivorous
bird mixture each feeding. If mice or baby chicks were put in the cage,
the hornbills would sit on their perch watching and gaping, never attempt-
ing to go down and pick them up. Once a single bird had ventured down
to pick up its own food, the others would invariably start doing the same
within three to five days.
In my contact with these hand-raised birds I never had one deliberately
attack me, but in their eagerness to eat they would frequently (mistakenly?)
grasp my fingers. Their first reaction seemed to be to jerk, twist, and
make every effort to get that " stubborn extra tidbit " loose.

A disconcerting habit they developed was to scrap over who would ride
on their feeder's shoulder around the cage while he was cleaning. This
same process was followed no matter who cared for them. They
appeared to have no favourites and to exhibit no fear of any human.
The two adult male wild-caught specimens that readily adapted to
captivity were neither friendly nor aggressive. They approached their
caretaker with caution, but not with apparent fear or aggression. Their
curiosity was extraordinary, and they would readily stick their heads into
any pail or container in the enclosure apparently to see what it offered.
The last specimen I obtained was an adult male that had been hand-
raised as a pet by an elderly Chinese woman near Alor Star (Malaysia).
She also hand-raised numerous Hoopoes (Upopa e. epops) for several
animal collectors. This male was by far the most handsome of all the
specimens collected. (It is now at the Buffalo Zoo). At the same time
that this single specimen was obtained two half-feathered Great Hornbills
(Buceros bicornis) were acquired. They required constant attention and
feeding. The male Wreathed was housed with the two young Great
Hornbills and immediately started to feed the two young hornbills. When
food was placed in the enclosure, the adult Wreathed would feed the two
young Great Hornbills until they stopped gaping before he would swallow
any food himself.
The two Great Hornbills, which are now at the Oklahoma City Zoo,
were fed by the Wreathed Hornbill for over six months on my farm in the
United States before the adopted parent gradually changed them over to
eating on their own. Both young birds were in full adult plumage and
were capable of flying quite well before they ever picked up food on their
own. Young Great Hornbills have been observed in the field by Negri
Sembilan Game Warden Dara Singh, eating by themselves at what
appeared to be a much younger age than these captive specimens.
Wild-caught adult Wreathed Hornbills observed at five zoos in Asia
all displayed severe aggression to their keepers. Two captive-raised
females in the Melaka Zoo were docile and appeared to seek human as
well as other bird company. They were even housed with a pair of small
Philippine Tarictic Plornbills (Penelopides panini) and displayed no
aggression, apparently acting as a calming factor on the smaller hornbills.

SUMMARY

<bodyText confidence="0.968801" page_id="56364421"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
Captive-raised Malaysian Wreathed Hornbills displayed little to no aggression
towards humans. This applied to both males and females housed singly or
collectively. Wild-caught adult birds were aggressive and almost impossible to
acclimate. Two of eight wild-caught adult birds (both males) adapted readily to
captive life and displayed little aggression.

One Black-footed Penguin, two Cereopsis Geese and one Javan Fish-
Owl have been bred in the Gardens. Only one egg was laid by the
fish-owl and so far as is known one has constituted the clutch on previous
occasions, so this may be the normal clutch. This pair regularly nests
very early in the year and may, of course, nest again as happened last year,
though in that instance the first chick died at an early age. Other owls
incubating eggs are the Great, Kenya, Spotted and Magellan Eagle-Owls,
and perhaps the Barn Owls.
Pigmy Falcons failed to hatch anything from the first clutch; it is not
known how many eggs were laid, but, as before, only one was found in the
nest. These birds may be nesting again in a hollow tree trunk as before.
Three species new to the collection have been received; these are a
Luzon Hornbill, Buceros hydrocorax hydrocorax , two Acorn Woodpeckers,
Melanerpes formicivorus, that were bred by the brothers Callegari in their
aviaries at Ravenna and a Rustic Bunting, Emberiza rustica , that was
presented together with a Yellow-throated Bunting, E. elegans , by Mr.
R. L. Restall.
There are some seven or eight races of Melanerpes formicivorus ranging
from south-western parts of North America, through Central America to
parts of Colombia, the three occurring in the United States being known
as the California or Acorn, Mearns's and Ant-eating Woodpeckers and it
is not known to which of the races the Ravenna birds belong, for they are
still in the immature plumage.
Another presentation is a specimen of Kakatoe sulphurea that is unlike
either of the other two races ( sulphurea and parvula) that are already here,
for it is larger and the crest straighter. Possibly it is K.s. abbotti , the race
inhabiting the island of Solombo Besar in the Java Sea.

One Chukor and one Red-legged Partridge have been presented by
Mr. W. L. Newlands; two Sun Bitterns have been purchased and five
Kansu Babblers presented by Dr. K. C. Searle.
A pair of Sacred Ibises occupied one of last year's nests and two eggs
which later disappeared, were laid. In the spring and summer the flanks
of these ibises become a brownish-yellow and I believe that this is due to
the birds anointing these areas with oil from the preen gland, for this oil
is of exactly the same colour. In winter the flank feathers are white.
A Marabou Stork has died after 21J years in the Gardens.

Philip Wayre showed his colour film " Pheasants to Formosa ".
This film which was first shown in colour on BBC 2 on 26th September,
1967, tells the story of the return to Taiwan of some Swinhoe's Pheasants
bred by the Ornamental Pheasant Trust and released in their native land
to reinforce the wild population which is threatened with extinction.
The film also covers Philip and Pat Wayre's journey into the remote
interior of the island in search of wildlife, with particular reference to rare
species of birds and mammals believed to be threatened with extinction.
They spent some time with the aborigines in the Central Mountain Range
and are believed to have been the only Europeans to have seen Swinhoe's
Pheasant alive in the wild. A full report on their observations of the
wildlife of the island with suggestions for its conservation is being sent to
I. U.C.N. and to the authorities in Taiwan.

During the past two or three years the prices of Australian parrakeets

the Continent too, have by now become accustomed to seeing birds

A correspondent in " American Cage-bird Magazine ", November,
1967, 22, asks: " What is the best way to put a bird to sleep? " The
answer given is: " The best way for the average fancier, with no access
to a medical lab,, is the way I do it, I put the bird in a paper bag, start
the car up and then hold the bag to the exhaust pipe. It is all over in
seconds. I then bury the bird, bag and all, if I can put a shovel in the
ground. This way I do not even have to see the bird/' This is a problem
that must from time to time face innumerable bird-keepers. All do not
have access to chloroform; in its absence what really is the best means
of euthanasia?

Dr. Geoffrey McLachlan Tygerberg Zoo Park, Durbanville, South
Africa, writes: " Pressure of work developing the major exhibits of the
Zoo (Chimpanzees, Rhinoceroses, Lions, Tigers, etc.) has meant that
birds have so far been more or less neglected. We have, however, a fair
collection of ducks on view. We were successful in breeding the
Knob-billed Duck, Sarkidiornis melanotos , which hatched five eggs, but
only one young one survived.
More successful was the hybridization of the Red-billed Teal, Anas
erythrorhyncha and the Cape Teal, Anas capensis. Five young were
hatched and reared to maturity. Unfortunately, they flew off before
being pinioned. In colour they were exactly intermediate between the
adults; the cap of the Red-billed being somewhat paler in the young.
Another female failed to hatch her clutch.' 5

In the January-February number of the Magazine, Franco Cuneo
recorded the successful rearing of a King Vulture, Sarcoramphus papa,
hatched in the Naples Zoological Gardens, in 1966.
Dr. Heinz Heck, Director, Catskill Game Farm, New York, in recent
correspondence, says that a young one successfully reared there in i960
is flourishing; only last year, this bird lost its remaining dark, juvenile
feathers.
An egg was laid on 16th March and hatched on nth May. Another
young one was hatched on 31st March, 1961, but disappeared on 13th
April, apparently eaten by its parents. The incubation period was 56
days in i960 and 58 days in 1961.
This pair of King Vultures has laid on numerous occasions, but the
eggs either disappeared or were destroyed, presumably because they were
not fertile. (See D. Zoolog. Garten (NF), 1963, 295-297).

Curt af Enehjelm, Director, Hogholmens Djurgard, Helsingfors,
writes of 1967: " I had one of the worst breeding seasons I can remember,
due to the loss of some of my best breeding pairs, pairs split up through
death, clear eggs, etc. I suspect that oil was partly to blame. I have
been using sea sand and possibly there has been some oil in it.

Late in the autumn, 1966, I bred two Black-cheeked Waxbills, Estrilda
erythronotos , both are still doing well. I believe this to be a very rare
breeding in Europe, although it has been bred several times in South
Africa.
I am working on the genetics of the two Parson Finch sub-species,
Poephila c. cincta and P. c. atropygialis . I have a number of pure-bred
and crosses " both-ways I am sure the heredity rules should be the
same as with Bicheno's Finch, Stizoptera b. bichenovii and S. b. annulosa ,
where the white back is dominant over the black, but I have got some
unexpected " exceptions " so I must continue my experiments.
Regarding the owls in 1967. I bred only two Snowy, two Virginian
Eagle-Owls and, of course, Kenya Eagle-Owls, Bubo capensis macinderi.
The last are a very hard-working pair. They started sitting 13th Decem-
ber, 1965, three eggs, one chick hatched 16th January, 1966; another
chick was hatched on 23rd August, 1966. They again started sitting on

quite an extensive collection, but it came to a tragic and untimely end.
In those days blue flame burners and the excellent blue, pink and green
paraffins were unknown. We had to make do with heaters advertised
" as used by orchid growers ". Provided burners were decarbonized
daily they did not smell too much, but the paraffin was noisome in the
extreme and the very idea of using such would scare present day users
of this form of heat. This particular type of heater consisted, in the main,
of a flat wick, about five inches wide, surrounded by asbestos. The
heating element was mounted above two tanks, the lower containing
paraffin and the upper water (to feed the asbestos and keep it moist). By
some inexplicable mischance the aviary attendant filled both tanks
with paraffin, with the result that the heater smoked very badly indeed.
By next morning several of the lories were already dead and the remainder
covered with thick, oily soot. Every possible means was mobilized to
clean them, but all efforts were unavailing and they all eventually suc-
cumbed. After that extremely unfortunate experience I never had
another lory or lorikeet.
This note is prompted by the advertisement of a dealer in West
Germany. During the past two or three years a couple of our members,
Jack Rawlings and Bill Brown, have been very successful in breeding
lorikeets---three " firsts From this one might think that their breed-
ing was fairly easy, but I am quite sure it is not as easy as the advertise-
ment would lead one to believe. The following eight species of lories
and lorikeets are advertised as " bred in West Germany ": Violet-necked,

From time to time Charles Lucas, President, Avicultural Society of
Australia, sends me a news-letter. In one received early in January he
writes: " I have had quite a successful season with my parrots but not
much luck with the finches. Our difficulties during the breeding season
were greatly increased owing to the fact that we have had here in Victoria
probably the worst drought in our experience. The result was that
seeding grasses were only available for a matter of a few weeks when,
owing to the heat and lack of water, they all dried up. We were compelled
to go back to the good old stand-by of lettuce leaves for green feed.
I had six pairs of Princess paired off and five of these pairs produced
a total of fourteen young, which is the best result I have had with them
for some years. My old pair of Crimson-wings went to nest as usual
and produced three nice young ones, but the Smokers and Barrabands
did not do a thing and there were few Neophemas. I have a young
Elegant from one nest which is a bright canary yellow on the back and
partly into the wing-feathers. It is a very strong and healthy young bird,
so I may be able to make something of it by crossing it back to one of
the parents.
A few years ago we had the good fortune to get in from overseas a
number of Red-faced Parrot Finches. We, of course, had to pay a high
price for them but they proved excellent breeders for a few years.
They then began to lose their stamina. About two years ago I had twenty-
six in my finch aviary, but they have gradually dwindled until today I
have only about six left and they are unfortunately not breeding, so the
indications are that I will soon be without any of these most attractive
birds: other aviculturists have had the same experience."

Accordingly mention is made of many American birds and several photo-

of the misunderstanding that may arise with popular names, for across the
Atlantic the same bird may have a different name and different birds have
the same name.
There could be no more attractive introduction to the subject of bird
behaviour than this well-chosen summary of some of the more interesting
examples. The scope of the work may be gathered from the list of

PIGEONS AND DOVES OF THE WORLD. By Derek Goodwin.

A general book on the Columbidae, a family of birds which constitutes
alone the order Columbiformes, was sorely needed. There are very
numerous species, distributed all over the world, wherever suitable
conditions exist, and they have always been popular with man, often,
unfortunately, because they are edible; but they also have captivated his
imagination. The dove is famous as a symbol of peace, a regrettable
mistake, as they are among the most pugnacious and quarrelsome of
birds. Some species have even been domesticated: the Rock Pigeon and
the Ring-doves--others are being continually bred in captivity, such as
the Diamond Dove, while yet others have been acclimatized in parts
of the world where they did not exist before. Mr. Goodwin's book is
therefore most welcome, and I hasten to say that, within the limits of its
446 pages, it is excellent.
There are hundreds of species of Pigeons and Doves, and to deal in
detail with each of them and its subspecies would necessitate eight or ten
large volumes. However essential information can be found in this one
quarto.
The same can be said for the illustrations. There are three coloured
plates representing a number of striking species, sexual and age differences
--it would have been marvellous to have every form shown in colour--
but again it is practically impossible to accomplish it. There are, however,
many line drawings and maps which fill our requirements sufficiently.
They are done by Robert Gillmor, some after sketches by Mr. Goodwin
himself from living specimens, and they are quite adequate and useful.
The author's systematic treatment of the Columbiformes appears to
me very satisfactory. He has wisely lumped a number of unnecessary
genera. Perhaps a few of the species he recognizes could be described as
sub-species if more accurate data on the distribution were available. It
is to be deplored that a complete list and more details of sub-species
could not be provided, but lack of room did not allow it; some very well-
known and sharply characterized ones, such as Streptopelia bitorquata
dussumieri , of the Philippines, are not even mentioned. Also, biblio-
graphy has been omitted and references are reduced to the original
description, following the specific name, and to a very few references at
the end of the article. As far as aviculturists are concerned, it is regret-
table that there is no mention of captivity records. Mr. Goodwin is very
clever at keeping and rearing birds, and the observation of his caged

pigeons and doves has taught him a great deal--as it has many other
ornithologists.
As I have said before, all the above regrets, which are not criticisms,
are due to the fact that one cannot state everything pertaining to a large
group of birds within less than 500 pages.
There are very few faults to be found in the text. All I could locate is
that the map of Tver on vernans does not show the distributional area of
this Green Pigeon in Southern Indo-China; that Ducula pacifica breeds
in the Loyalty Islands and occasionally in New Caledonia, and that
Gallicolumba criniger always lays only one egg in a clutch, a puzzling
characteristic as the closely allied Bleeding-heart (G. luzonica) always lays
two.
After a highly sensible introduction, one finds excellent general chapters
on nomenclature, adaptation, coloration, plumage sequences, clutch and
egg colour, feeding habits, drinking, bathing, sunning, preening and
comfort movements, voice and other sounds signals, display and social
behaviour (this is a long and very interesting study), pairs formation and
relationship, nesting and parental care, escape and other anti-predator
movements.
The bulk of the volume consists of the listing of genera and species.
There is a full discussion of their positions for every genus. Then each
species is well described; field characters, distribution, feeding and
general habits, nesting, voice and displays, are given in an accurate and
fairly extensive way, as long as they are known. It is a good resume of
whatever is known at present. As I have said before, Mr. Goodwin's
nomenclature and classification does in my opinion represent an excellent
way of treating this large and well characterized order, and I hope it will
be accepted by the majority of ornithologists. He must be highly con-
gratulated for having achieved such a remarkable and condensed piece
of work.

This book makes the first major attempt to describe bird songs in
musical terms and includes a detailed description of the songs of 127
species occurring in the U.S.A. It is pointed out that success in identify-
ing birds' songs depends more upon the ability of the ear to discriminate
differences of rhythm than upon differences of tone, although some
authors entertain a contrary opinion. Modulation and fine shades of
" colour " together with melodious phrasing are said to take the place of
rhythm, but this may be a confusion of mechanical time with the rhythm
or metre.

A diagram is provided of the drum beat as the most obvious explanation
of a rhythmic beat. It is stated that any child would know what was being
represented if this was tapped out on a table, but the reviewer fails to
understand what it means! The author goes into considerable detail to
explain a musical key and on page xxxii (not xxii as erroneously stated in
the text) gives a diagram of note values, etc. The diagram on page xxxiv
shows the pitch of 21 bird songs relatively with the keyboard, and another
diagram shows the pitch of 15 bird songs relatively to the keyboard.
Then follows a description of the musical scales of the Thrushes, including
the most melodious of bird songs.
After this introductory chapter the author deals with the songs of 127
species of birds occurring in the U.S.A., in each case giving the musical
notation of the song, and descriptions of the syllables. Even Owls are
included in the list of songsters although the Screech Owl is not on the
" prohibitive " list of songbirds recognized by the State laws. In
addition to descriptions of the songs of the birds considered, the book
includes black and white illustrations of them and also six maps relating
to the migrations of birds. The text illustrations of this interesting
treatise are excellent but the half-tone plates of the birds themselves
might well have been omitted.

EGG EATING IN THE BUDGERIGAR (.Melopsittacus undulatus)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975558952380952" page_id="56364431"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
Recently in our laboratory, budgerigars were observed to devour an egg laid in
the open section of the cage by a budgerigar hen. The hen had been evicted from
a nest box prior to this by a dominant hen.
All budgerigars in the cage ate the egg (including the hen which laid it).
An egg which has been abandoned has little or no hope of survival as the young
bird must be fed by the parent for some weeks after hatching. If the abandoned
egg was not eaten, its high nutrient value would be lost to the colony, and in the
open arid areas to which the species is endemic this would indeed be unfortunate.
It would seem that budgerigars may have evolved this nutrient-saving mechanism
in their natural environment where food is scarce, and what at first is apparently
senseless cannibalism may be an ecological energy conserving action.
This hypothesis was based on a single observation, but I have never witnessed
nor heard reports of the eating of eggs in a nest box even when the hen was
temporarily absent. Other evidence now at hand supports this view, but is as yet
inconclusive.
To test this hypothesis we will have to observe the budgerigar in its natural state.
Meanwhile I would like to hear from breeders and fanciers who have observed
either:
Eggs abandoned in the open cage (stating whether eaten or uneaten), or eggs
eaten in the nest-box.

NfiNE BREEDING IN HAWAII

I had the pleasure of visiting the State breeding farm for Nene Geese on Hawaii,
at Pohakuloa, on 29th February, 1968. There are 24 pairs of breeding birds, each
one placed in a good sized grassy pen, covered with wire-netting. The results for
1968 are excellent; just over 100 young birds have been reared this season and
20 to 30 more are expected. After experimenting with muscovy ducks and
broody hens as foster mothers, also with incubators with greater or lesser
success, Mr. Ah. Fat Lee, who is in charge of the project, made a new experiment
in 1967. He has let each pair hatch their first clutch of eggs, then immediately
removed the goslings, which have been reared in brooders. The geese lay again
and they are allowed to rear the second brood.
A certain number of wild broods have been observed on the high volcanoes of
Hawaii, some on Maui--But it is not easy to count them accurately.
Mr. Lee should be warmly congratulated for his very successful handling of
the Nene.

FEMALE BLUE-CROWNED HANGING PARRAKEETS ASSUMING
MALE COLOURING

<bodyText confidence="0.984868545454545" page_id="56364432"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
In 1965 I brought some Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeets, and they proved to
be three males and two females. In 1966 one pair had three clutches, the other
pair two, unfortunately infertile except one egg, where the chick was dead at an
early stage. In the autumn of 1966 one of the females, after moulting, showed the
red gular patch of the male, but a little darker in colour. In 1967 there was only
one egg, infertile, but in the autumn the second hen got a red gular patch. This
hen died in January 1968.
On 10 January, 1968, I discovered three eggs in a box, and a few days later there
was at least one chick; the hen was in the box when I checked.
I would be very pleased to know if any of the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine have seen a similar case of male colouring in the female of this species.

DEFINITION OF THE WORD " AVICULTURE "
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9931108" page_id="56364432"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
It has taken us a while to get to writing to you in appreciation for the definition
of the word " aviculture " on page 178 of the September-October 1967 issue of
Avicultural Magazine.
When we started to become so very much involved in birds some 10 years ago
(this may not seem a long time to folk who have known and loved birds much, much
longer---like 30 years or more!) we wanted a name for ourselves that would explain
our hobby?
In one of our bird books we found the word aviculture and we believed this
meant us. In reading what A. A. Prestwich wrote, we were assured we were right
in taking this name.
We joined a bird club hoping to learn more about birds but the members were
bird-fanciers interested only in showing their birds and coming home with all the
trophies their arms could hold. We have kept our membership in this club just
for the contacts it gives us with bird folk, hoping always that somewhere, sometime
we will meet other aviculturists.

AVICULTURAL CONSERVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995706771929824" page_id="56364433"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
I find interesting the suggestion by Mr. E. Marshall Boehm (Avicultural
Magazine Vol. 73, No. 4) of establishing a world avicultural centre for the con-
servation of rare species, but question if the idea is feasible.
The Red Book, compiled by the International Council for Bird Preservation and
issued in conjunction with the International Union for Conservation of Nature,
lists the many species of birds which are considered to be in danger of becoming
extinct. Obviously some of these forms are at present beyond avicultural
assistance but perhaps one hundred species, or more, could be and in some cases
are being bred in confinement.
To house say six breeding pairs (a safety minimum) of one hundred rare species
and provide aviaries for acclimatization and young stock requirements would
really be a formidable project in view of the very limited funds available for the
conservation of Wild Life.
Thinking further of expense, a considerable scientific staff and skilled keepers
would be needed together with full research facilities and the establishing of a
complete dietary programme (bearing in mind the eventual re-introduction of
captive bred stock to the wild state) which would impose a strain on any foundation.
Unhappily it would not be possible, in my view, to offset the expenditure by
allowing the general public access to the centre for the disturbance caused thereby
would diminish the number of birds bred.
The risks of infection, fire, theft and acts of God to a single bank of rare avifauna
are too terrible to contemplate.
Perhaps as an aviculturist in a minute way, I think small but I doubt if a com-
plete programme involving acclimatization, general health, correct nutritional needs
for both breeding and re-establishment in the wild, could be organized for each
equally important species all at the same time.
If all countries had both the will to save its natural fauna and flora and the
resources of wealth and local experts the problem of conservation would in most
cases be largely concerned with maintaining a healthy balance.
In the topical case, competant aviculturists, registered with the appropriate
Government department, would be entrusted with pairs of the endangered species.
Numbers would build up in captivity and ornithologists would study the cause of
the species decline in the wild and erradicate or modify it. Suitable aviaries
would then be established in the right ecological sites for the important re-establish-
ment in the wild of the captive bred stock.
Alas in many (most?) countries this dream is unlikely to be realized. The
nearest to this utopia one can at present hope to reach is for all aviculturists, of
proven ability and who are interested in conservation work, to be registered with
Fauna conservation groups. The latter will surely not squander for ever the
opportunity of at least giving Aviculture the chance to prove its real value in
conservation work (greater longevity in adult breeding stock and greater survival
percentage in young reared in captive stock must mean swifter population growth).
Aviculture must improve its image and it should be the principal duty of the
Avicultural Society to do this. Greater encouragement should be given to the
establishment of aviary bred strains of Foreign and native species.
A register of species on the Red List kept by members and more important the
numbers of young bred from these species should be published in the Magazine
each year. This list should be submitted to leading ornithological and con-
servation journals with the request of publication.
Finally, many of our members no doubt contribute to the World Wildlife Fund;
could not these contributions be channelled via the Avicultural Society with the
particular request that rare avian species benefit?
I'm afraid I have used Mr. Marshall Boehm's idea to ride once again my hobby
horse of " Aviculture and Conservation " but I am sure that no one is more
equipped, if given the opportunity of breeding a rare species in confinement than
the owners of the Edward Marshall Boehm Aviaries.

BREEDING SPREO STARLINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992471314285714" page_id="56364434"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
Readers may be interested to know of the consistent success we have had in
breeding Spreo Starlings in the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust's aviaries. From
the avicultural point the aviaries are very far from ideal. The birds get quite a
considerable amount of disturbance, as the public has a passage-way through the
shelter portion, even dogs are allowed. It is quite exasperating to see parent birds,
on the point of feeding with live food, suddenly freeze, owing to a dog appearing
in front of their cage: or, perhaps, a party of school-children screaming, shouting,
waving flags, etc., enter the shelter part of the aviary.
The first Spreo, believed to be a cock, was purchased in 1948. In 1952 three
more, which proved to be a cock and two hens, were purchased. In 1954, one
young one was bred, and further young were bred each year up to 1964. I never
managed to rear more than one or two young in a nest. Most of the trouble was
that 5o%~75% of the young were lost a few weeks after leaving the nest, due to
gape-worms. One year I kept the parent birds shut in the shelter-shed, thinking
that gapes would'nt trouble them as the floor is concrete, but the young were
troubled just the same as before.
Mr. Tom Spence purchased a pair of Spreos from Foxwarren Park when the
collection was dispersed in 1955, and for several years successfully bred some
young ones. Almost four or five years ago I exchanged with him an aviary-bred
hen for an aviary-bred cock. In 1965 and 1966 I did'nt breed any young, having
lost the two hens I purchased in 1952. I tried putting together some of my others,
but it is often very difficult to know when one has a pair.
In 1967, from the cock I got from Tom Spence and a hen I bred in 1963, I
managed to rear a nest of three. I expected to lose one or two with gapes, but this
time, although they appeared to be affected, they all survived. Previously, the
young when troubled with gapes coughed and gasped in a distressing manner,
whereas on this occasion there was no gasping, only a great deal of coughing.
From time to time I have lost a few birds, due to accidents, fighting, escaping,
and unknown causes, but at present I have nine Spreos, all aviary-bred and, apart
from the cock (aviary-bred) I got from Tom Spence, I have never introduced any
others since I first started breeding them in 1954. I find that with our aviary-bred
birds, hens seem to be greatly in a minority.
I feel sure that had I been able to give the breeding pairs more privacy and
separate accommodation the results would have been very much better.

I have just had the misfortune to lose my Blue-cheeked Red-tailed Amazon
Parrot on 15th January, 1968, through old age and ill health, it lived for 10 years
with me and 2 or 3 years with its previous owner. I wish to thank Mr. Allen
Silver for helping me over it's feeding problems also it's periods of ill health, it
often used to fall off it's perch but it always recovered, till this last time. I have
just heard from Dr. Dean Amadon who is the Lamont Curator of birds in the
American Museum of Natural History, New York, U.S.A. There is a possibility
that it is rare owing to it's habitat being in the part of Brazil which is much cut
over and settled also, it is shy, but it is now regarded as conspecific with Amazona
duresiana Shaw which ranges all the way to the Guianas. I have never seen
another living specimen except my own bird though it has been kept in the
London Zoo along time ago, I have travelled over a great part of the world.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not heresay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

(Spreo superbus)
By Robin Restall (Copenhagen, Denmark)
The Spreo Starling was first imported into Britain as recently as 1923,
and Delacour (1925) probably writing in 1924 said of it, " . . . has just
been imported from East Africa; it is a gorgeous bird with bright greenish-
blue upperparts, orange-chestnut underparts, and a white bar across the
chest ". Even while he wrote, Alfred Ezra was busy in Surrey breeding
Spreo Starlings, and during 1924 his pair reared two broods, each of two
birds. (Ezra, 1924). He was subsequently awarded a first breeding
medal by the Avicultural Society.
However, Spreos were also bred at the Zoo in the same year, and other
successes were also recorded. So by the time that Delacour's words
appeared in print, they had a certain historical ring to them. By 1936,
D. H. Risdon was describing them as one of the easiest foreign softbills
to breed. I will leave to others to comment on the anachronistic nature
of my notes herewith, based on repeated unsuccessful breeding attempts
of Spreos I kept in 1966! But I do feel that if reports from members are
exclusively concerned with successful breedings--as most of them are--
then the literature must by sheer definition be incomplete and onesided.
For the reader who is not familiar with the natural history of the species,
I would like to preface my notes with some brief remarks:
Distribution
Restricted to East Africa, it ranges from central Ethiopia to the Somali
Republic, Southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (Praed and
Grant, i960).
Habitat
It is a common species, widely distributed and fairly ubiquitous in
habitat. It seems to be primarily a bird of Savannah and scrub.
Food
Fairly omnivorous, feeding mainly on small fruits and insect life.

A gregarious and tame bird, not particularly put off by man. It
feeds on the ground in small parties, and is obviously easy to trap at the
waterholes.
Nest and eggs
The nest is either a spherical ball of grass surrounded with thorny
twigs and lined with feathers, placed low in a thorn tree, or it may be in a
hole or an adapted suitable nest from another species (Praed and Grant).
The eggs are clean, greeny-blue, and usually there are four of them. I
have rarely been without Spreos over the past seven or eight years.
Most of the pairs I have had have been both cocks, and I have had several
odd cocks. In 1966, I received a very good pair, in breeding condition,
that had made several attempts to breed the previous year. Their
previous owner had been bitten by the parrot-like bug and was casting
softbills to the winds left, right and centre for the sake of various parrakeets.
The following notes, and illustrations are based on the entries concerning
this pair in my aviaries diary from 8th April, 1966, through to September
of the same year. Certain comments though are qualified by other
experiences with this species.
Arrival and early nesting behaviour
On the morning of 8th April, at 11.30, the Spreos were placed in an
outside flight, 12 ft. longx 3 ft. wide, (with a small shelter 3 ft. x 3 ft. x
3 ft. in the birdroom attached). The flight, which had previously
housed Redrumps was occupied by a pair of Red-crested Black Tanagers
(Tachyphonus coronatus ) and a cock Blue-grey Tanager ( Thraupis virens).
The Spreos had spent the winter, in a cage and were obviously terribly
excited, leaping about and flying to and fro screaming and screeching.
By 5 o'clock that afternoon the Spreos were carrying straw around in
their bills, and harrying the Tanagers seriously. They were removed.
I could not identify the sexes on sight then, but it became clear subse-
quently that it was the hen who was carrying the straw, and the cock who
was doing the harrying. By dusk that evening the floor of the house
chamber was strewn with dead leaves, twiglets and straw. On the
morning of the 10th, I hung up an old Cockateil nesting-box (measuring
about 9 in. x 8 in. x 12 in.) with a well-chewed entrance hole in the flight.
This caused much excitement and the birds started nest building
immediately. The floor of the flight was thick with grass, but I added
handfuls of thin bendy twigs, wood wool and straw. I am too cynical
by now to believe that any birds of mine are serious when they start nest
building, so I affected a calm lack of concern with their hysterics, and
left them alone for a week.

Identifying the sexes
It is perhaps apposite here to explain the difference between the sexes
of this pair (and most pairs of Spreos, I think), because the notes that
follow hinge on this factor. The male differed in being bolder looking,
more retiring in my presence, less tame and, visually, by having a notice-
ably wider breast bar. This is shown in Figure 1.
The nest construction
By 17th April, I looked into the nest-box (half expecting to see a brood
of lusty chicks!) but found the nest half-built (Fig. 2 a). The cavity on
one side was shaping up nicely, although the base was still the wood of the
box floor. There was a slight overlap at the top of the cavity. I recorded
surprise at the amount of material that the birds had used to produce
such unspectacular results, so I gave much more.

<bodyText confidence="0.999555153846154" page_id="56364452"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
A few days later I noticed the hen repeatedly sitting half in the box
with her tail outside, and made a sketch (Fig. 3). I thought she was
working on building the roof over the nest cavity, although there was ! ;
never any sign of movement. On the 21st, I listed the material which
had been given to the Spreos so far and this was:
thin twigs, scraps of wood wool, bits of spring, straw, a few odd
feathers, dead leaves, feathers, teased-out sisal string, carpet pickings
and fluff, a proprietary packet of canary nesting material, fluff from the
filter of the tumble-dryer, and a mass of long dogs hair.
On the 23rd, I examined the nest in some detail and was astounded at
its construction. There was a firm platform (the roof of the nesting
chamber) immediately below the entrance hole, then a short but distinct
tunnel twisted down and round into the nest cavity depression. It was
rather like a contorted retort. All of the material except the last in the
list above had been used, but in addition every nook and cranny had
been stuffed with grass to present a very warm and cosy snuggery. The
dogs hair had been used exclusively as a lining for the entire chamber and
had been so arranged as to present a smooth, silky surface (Fig. 2 b).
For the past week or so I had been watching these two very carefully
indeed and I am convinced that only the hen does any nest building at all.
Certainly the cock will pick up bits of material, but only so that he can
have something in his beak to sing about. It is soon dropped, or occa-
sionally passed to the hen. The hen collects as much as her bill will
hold before going to the box. However, on one occasion--a week later--
I did see the cock take a bit of straw into the nest. He was very reluctant
and shy. It was as if he was frightened rather than not knowing what to do.

My friend, Derek Goodwin, was visiting me on the 29th, and noticed
the hen soliciting to the cock, but no copulation was seen. A couple of
days later I noticed a similar sequence. I am afraid I have no detailed
notes of this at all, the hen bird simply leaned forward slightly, raised her
tail slightly and drooped her wings a little in a fluttering movement.
The whole thing was almost momentary.
Eggs and brooding
My entry for the 7th May reads, " Five very warm eggs. Turquoise.
Almost certainly being brooded. Could kick myself for not getting
laying dates." On the 17th I found the eggs stone cold, each contained
a well developed chick around 11 days old. In my rush to feed and
check the aviaries on the previous morning, I had shut the adults into
their shelter to avoid their predictable displays of distress while I inspec-
ted the eggs and changed the water in the trough. I forgot to let them
out in the flight again! Mistakes like that are only made once, and I
blush to recall it now. By the 20th the hen was actively working on the
nest again, reinforcing the structure with much fine grass. On the 23 rd
an egg was laid, on the 25th a second, and a third on the 26th. Two of
them hatched on Monday the 6th June, the third chick appeared on Wed-
nesday, the 8th, which is a difficult sum to work out, but anyway it gives
mean incubation of 12 days, with a possible variation of 11-14 days.
Later broods invariably hatched on a twelve/thirteen day basis.

I had scrupulously avoided entering the flight, and had only realised
that hatching had begun by noticing bits of eggshell on the ground at the
farthest possible point away from the nest. This proved to be the rule,
whatever aviary the birds were subsequently housed in.
One interesting point of behaviour is that the hen would frequently
get herself wet, in fact nearly soaking on all her underparts before entering
the nest to brood. Throughout the two years that I had this pair the
hen alone appeared to brood. She always had a good stretch (Fig. 4 )
after a spell in the nest.
Nestling period
From the start the parents appeared to be devoted and sound at their
job. The hen was much bolder at the feeding bowl than the cock, and,
in fact, did about 90% of the feeding. I very much wanted to release the
birds to forage for themselves at liberty. The risk of losing the male was
obvious, but I was sure I would keep the hen. However, I was dissuaded
by others, which I will always regret.
On the morning of the fourth day (the third chick was two days old)
all three were strong and begging vigorously. On the sixth day I made

the sketch for Figure 5. On the seventh day I examined each chick, and
they were clearly of different sizes. Their appetites were enormous, and
quite insatiable. The three chicks could always be found lying in an
arrowhead formation with all three beaks pointing in the same direction,
towards the tunnel. One day at around this time a grey squirrel was
playing around the aviaries and foraging in the thick grass around the
wire netting. Both Spreos clung to the wire alongside the animal and
seemed hypnotized by its presence. They alternately sung, whistled and
shrieked at it.
By the 8th day my mealworms had run out, and as every breeder will
know, the German breeders always go on strike or get diseased or some-

thing right in the middle of the season. (Thank heaven Mr. Coombes
is now breeding them in England!) So for a few days the birds were
restricted to maggots by the pint, and what else I could provide. My
office work suddenly became much greater and I had to rely on the
foraging abilities of the local children, but even 2 d. each failed to produce
more than a dozen spiders and grasshoppers. The next morning the
smallest of the three young birds was found dead on the ground beneath
the nest.

On the morning of the 10th day, I had to fly to Scotland, not returning
until the evening of the 12th. Not surprisingly, the entire stock of
maggots had been consumed and none were left. The next smallest
chick was also dead on the ground.
On the 14th day I took the remaining youngster from the nest and drew
it (Figs. 6 and 7). It seemed a fine, happy and healthy bird, with no sign
of rickets, malnutrition, or any deficiency or abnormality. By this time,
I was lucky to spend more than ten minutes a day with all my birds due
to pressure of work, and was having to rely on mealworms and maggots for
live food. It became apparent that less live food was being taken, and the
hen would come and inspect the bowl, select just a few mealworms and
then fly off to the box. The cock was not even interested in mealworms
(Fig. 8).
I renewed my bribes to the local children, and at 3 d. each found three
spiders! On the 17th day, the last youngster was found dead.
Nest sanitation
On one occasion I saw one of the adults fly from the nest with a faece
in its beak. It flew to a large stone at the end of the flight, stepped to
the ground and proceeded to tuck the bright white thing in amongst the
long grass at what turned out to be exactly the farthest point from the
nest. The nest was kept scrupulously clean always.

In my experience, with this pair of Spreos--seven unsuccessful attempts
in all, over two years--feeding was the critical factor. The parents
quickly became bored with mealworms and maggots, only fed the latter
in the absence of mealworms, and never gave the youngsters (up to 3 weeks
old anyway) anything but live food. All three young of the fourth
brood (the third to hatch) died suffering from malnutrition gained from
a diet consisting entirely of maggots and mealworms. By then it was
impossible to find live insects in significant quantities.
The basic diet, and the one preferred by the Spreos even now, is
mealworms, maggots--fresh and fat, and maggot pupae--fresh and red,
diced pears, diced soft apple and fresh Sluis universal soft food. While
breeding the Universal was enriched with the protein-rich Befkin. The
water in the shelter contained stimulite, while in the flight the shallow
trough contained rainwater. During the first week of the above saga,
I noted that I fed them with mealworms, and maggots and whatever live
food I could get. The hen always took the mealworm pupae in preference
to the larvae. She usually took just as many as she could carry (Fig. 9).
On one day the tally went: 5 spiders, 15 woodlice, 8 beetles, 1 millipede,
1 earwig. And on another day my notes read: " Fed about 150 small
caterpillars collected from a Euonymus japonica bush, 30 ant pupae and
big fat butterfly chrysalis. All went very quickly. The first lot of half
the caterpillars went in one beakful!! So did all the ant pupae. Hen
took them all, but cock did not even take one for himself. After all had
gone she then took some fresh mealworms. Very depressing. How am
I going to keep up this rate--and what about the other birds? " The
other birds made do with maggots.

When the Spreos were first introduced into their first aviary with the
three tanagers they certainly chased them a lot. Later on in the season
I moved them into a larger planted flight, 12 ft. x 9 ft. (with a 9 ft. x 3 ft.x
3 ft. shelter) w T hich they shared with the tanagers and some American
buntings, a pair of canaries and a few other odd birds. There was a
box screwed to the wall which I could not be bothered to remove, thinking

the Spreos were out of condition having had three broods (two of which
hatched and were reared to 21 days). However, they built a nest in this
which I only discovered after some weeks. It was a wider box, and the
nest chamber was rather more complicated as a result (see Fig. 2 c).
Nothing really came of this nest; two eggs were laid and hatched but
with a reduced fervour and enthusiasm, and despite lavish supplies of
mealworms and maggots, which were fed on high protein baby foods,
dusted with PYM, etc., the young died with rickets in a fortnight. How-
ever, shortly afterwards the hen started patching the nest up for a fifth
brood. The cock must have come back into condition for he became
more vociferous, and slaughtered a male Lazuli Bunting ( Passerina cyana).
It happened literally while my back was turned a few seconds during a bird
watching spell. All the Spreos I have kept have been mixed with other
species for most of the time; the above incident was the only death but
not the only example of unreliability.
In my experience single birds, or pairs of the same sex, are safe with
anything, even Quail Finches and other estrildines. A true pair are best
kept alone or with birds significantly larger than them unless the owner is
prepared to run the risk of damage. I have one odd Spreo cock at the
moment, and he is in a large aviary (17 ft. x 12 ft. flight, 9 ft. x 12 ft.
shelter) with a few other odd birds including a pair of Chinese Crested
Mynahs ( Acridotheres cristatellus) which are the same size as the Hill
Mynah ( Gracula religiosa). But when the food searching in the under-
growth or dead leaves seems to be going well the Spreo will see them off
just as a Blackbird sees off a sparrow from wanted food.
Diagnostic markings
The Spreo is distinguished by its snow-white vent and under tail-
coverts, and this area is frequently displayed after flight. The bird will

alight on a perch after a long flight and cock its tail up in the air the instant
after alighting--rather in the manner that a Blackbird will. The move-
ment is as slow, and seems quite deliberate. It is particularly noticeable
when a pair are together, but a single bird seems to do it much less
frequently, and the movement is refined and much less accented when
the bird is alarmed or apprehensive.
Song
The male Spreo will sing at great length, a loosely-strung series of
warbles, whistles and odd notes. The one I have at present has snatches
of Robin and Blackbird in his song, and some snatches of the canary's
trill. The natural song is actually more pleasant and is less incoherent.
Females appear to sing, but less often, and usually for the best reason the
male appears to have and that is when the crop is full and the sun is
shining. The bird settles down comfortably and warbles forth. I have
never seen the courtship display described by other writers.
Summary and conclusions
Superb Spreo Starlings are as willing to breed as their reputation
would have one believe. It is not easy to obtain a true pair as dealers
supply by the " each " method, and are not prepared to back their hunch
by an exchange or money back guarantee. Success is related primarily
to feeding, which must have variety in addition to quantity and quality.
The hen assumes most of the parental responsibilities, building the nest
and feeding the young. In the event of trouble no doubt she could be
relied upon to rear the young alone. It is suggested that the male could
be caged alongside the flight containing the nest, and the hen given liberty
to forage abroad for live food " on the hoof ". It is the author's intention
to try this on his return to the United Kingdom, in due course. Breeding
pairs are of uncertain temper and it is likely that the cock is the aggressive
one acting from a territory-defence stimulus rather than either or both
birds acting from a save-all-the-food-for-ourselves position. When not
breeding they are tractable, and odd birds, or numbers of the same sex,
are safe in mixed collections.

By A. H. Isenberg (Portola Valley, Calif., U.S.A.)
Seven years ago I had pairs of Hartlaub's and Knysna Touracos, then
about 1962 one of each pair died apparently in perfect condition. The
remaining two birds were in adjoining aviaries and I noticed much
" billing " between them a few days later. Upon allowing Hartlaub's in
with Knysna the two birds became very friendly and within a week were
building a nest. This aviary is about 10 ft. by 20 ft. and 8 ft. high plus
a shelter which extends approximately 5 ft. into a greenhouse. In this
shelter I fastened a flat-bottom basket some 6J ft. from the ground and this
the birds took to the next day adding only a few twigs. Soon one egg was
laid and in two days the second. Incubation was approximately 22 days
as best I could estimate as the adults sat very tightly. The young hatched
at two-day intervals and were rather grotesque little black " Dodo-like "
creatures with a little dark down. Both parents incubated, and tenderly
cared for their offspring, sitting very tightly to excess it seemed.
One young was perfect, but the other succumbed in five days with both
legs broken at the hips and the bird quite flattened out. The good one
also died a few days after leaving the nest.
During the next two years the pair had over 20 eggs, most of which
hatched, but the young always had their legs broken at the hip thus
becoming useless and dying time after time.
The pair was moved into a very large aviary (60 x40 x12 ft.) well
planted, but again the birds selected a basket in the large shelter room
about 10 ft. off the ground. Here again more of the same tragedy.
I thought the parents sat too long and too tightly on the young. After
the third failure here in 1965 I was fortunate in taking two young at
10 and 12 days old and rushed them over to the Eric Kinseys where
Mrs. Kinsey applied her most expert skill of rearing birds and did a
simply marvellous job of bringing these two Touracos to maturity. The
first hand-reared Touracos I have seen and both birds remained delight-
fully tame. Nestling Touracos are very " flabby ", absolutely limber and
feel rather boneless but yet quite heavy.
Two more attempts were made that year but with the same tragic
results.
The two young, after almost two years, are still very tame and when I
enter the aviary and in a high pitched voice say " Papayapapaya " they
become very excited and try coming through the wire to get their favourite
fruit. The two birds started fighting and had to be separated and I think
they are males.
In 1966 the adults were again moved into another large aviary
(60 x 20 x 10 ft.) without a heated shelter and here they were forced to

build their own nest which they did in short order. Touracos build a
rather loose nest of twigs similar to doves but somewhat larger.
In this aviary more young were hatched with the same tragic end
except for one young which they reared very well from the third nesting.
The same nest was used for these several broods. This was at last the
success I had hoped for.
In 1967 only two attempts were made and none hatched. Only two
eggs are laid for each nesting. The adults are still together and they
nested almost throughout the year even in December, January and
February, our coldest season, with temperature down to 28* F. at times
during night and early morning. Thousands of mealworms were taken
by the adults, especially by the male Hartlaub, which were fed to the young
by regurgitation. Some rainworms were also taken and the Hartlaub's
was seen many times on the ground searching for insects. The eggs and
young were rarely exposed as the parents would exchange duty immediately.
The birds had access to fruits at all times, grapes, apple, etc. The adults
also ate much of my hard-boiled egg mixture which consists of one part
each of bran and toasted wheat germ and three parts of hard-boiled egg
which is put through a coarse sieve and then gently mixed with the bran
and wheat germ. Pound cake is also relished and some soaked currants
and raisins; greens are also taken such as lettuce and grass. Blueberries
and papaya are a great treat.
The fully adult offspring of this hybrid look more like Hartlaub's than
Knysna, the crest being quite taller than Hartlaub's with white tips.
They also have the white spot above the bill as in Hartlaub's and the white
streak under the eye; the whole bird is greener and altogether if anything a
prettier bird than Hartlaub's.
I have not heard of this hybrid before and would be interested to know
how many other Touraco hybrids have occurred.

By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, England)
The opening paragraph of the preface to Walter Scheithauer's Humming-
birds (reviewed by " E. H." in the Magazine, 1968, p. 33) states: " The
first live humming bird to arrive in Europe was a Sparkling Violet-ear
(Colibri coruscans) which was exhibited in 1905 at the Zoological Gardens
in Regent's Park, London. For fourteen days it created a sensation and
the many visitors who saw it were filled with astonishment and wonder.
Then it died. It had presented more problems to science than any other
known bird. Practically nothing was understood about its care and
management; the correct food was certainly not known. Under these
circumstances it was not possible to keep this exceptionally beautiful bird
alive ". This statement needs correcting in that while a humming bird
was exhibited to the public in 1905, probably for the first time, it was not
the first to reach England alive. The following are the available reports,
in the main genuine, but two perhaps somewhat imaginary.
E. A. Porter (1906) tells us: " In the Library of the Zoological Society are
the original drawings by Hayes, with a manuscript title page as follows:
' Rare and Curious Birds accurately drawn and beautifully coloured from
specimens in the Menagerie at Osterly Park,' the size is folio and it is
dated 1782, although some of the drawings bear earlier dates than this,
and in it are figured three species of Humming Birds. The volume also
contains a few other birds not figured in his work of 1794."
William Hayes (1729-1799) was a zoological artist blessed with a very
large family, no less than twenty-one children. His drawings from the
Osterley Park Menagerie were made with the co-operation of his family--
seven of his children being involved in the project.
The Osterley Park Menagerie, Middlesex, was quite extensive. It was
owned by Robert Child, of banking fame. Hayes drew in the main from
living models, but one cannot help wondering whether one of his numerous
assistants did in fact produce the humming bird plate from skins.
The following account will surely be read with a mixture of amusement
and reserve. John Latham (1822), writing under the heading Mango
Humming-bird, says: " The circumstance of keeping Humming-Birds
alive in their own climate, by means of sugar and water, is well authenti-
cated, and the following fact is also well attested. A young Gentleman,
a few days before he sailed from Jamaica for England, met with a female
Humming-Bird sitting on the nest and eggs, and cutting off the twig,
he brought all together on board. The bird became sufficiently tame,
so as to suffer herself to be fed with honey and water during the passage,
and hatched two young ones. The mother, however, did not long survive,
but the young were brought to England, and continued for some time in
the possession of Lady Hamond. The late Sir H. Englefield, Bart, and
Hans Sloane Stanley, Esq. both witnesses of the circumstance, informed

me, that these little creatures readily took honey from the lips of Lady H.
with their bills; one of them did not live long, but the other survived at
least two months from the time of their arrival. I am not positive of its
being the precise species I have arranged it under, but am inclined to
think so, from the description of the parent bird, and especially as it
is the most common one found in that Island."
When we come to John Gould we are on firm ground. In 1857 he
imported a Ruby-throated. Gould (1861) says he " succeeded in bringing
a living pair within the confines of the British Islands, and a single indi-
vidual to London, where it lived two days ..."
In P.Z.S. (1857) there is a note to the effect that Mr. Gould gave details
of his observations on Trochilus in the United States. " When captured
it so speedily becomes tame that it will feed from the hand or mouth within
half an hour. Successful in keeping one alive during a long railway journey,
in a gauze bag attached to his breast button, for three days, during which
it readily fed from a small bottle filled with a syrup of brown sugar and
water, Mr. Gould determined to attempt the bringing of some living
examples to England, in which he succeeded, but unhappily they did not
long survive their arrival in London, and died on the second day: had they
lived, it was his intention to have sent them to the Society's Gardens,
where they would doubtless have been objects of great attraction ".
An account by Gould is reproduced in Cassell&apos;s Book of Birds (1869-
1873): "A Trochilus colibris captured for me by some friends pumped
the fluid from a little bottle whenever offered it, and in this manner it
lived with me a constant companion for several days, travelling in a
little, thin gauze bag, distended with whalebone, and suspended to a
button of my coat. It was only necessary for me to take the bottle in my
hand to induce it to thrust its spiny bill through the gauze, protrude its
lengthened tongue down the neck of the bottle, and pump up the fluid till
it was satiated; it would then fly to the bottom of its little home, preen its
tail and wing feathers, and seem quite content.
" The specimens I brought alive to this country were as docile and
fearless as a great moth under similar treatment. The little cage in
which they lived was twelve inches long, seven wide, and eight high. In
this was placed a diminutive twig, and suspended to the side a glass phial,
which I daily supplied with saccharine matter in the form of sugar or
honey and water, with the addition of the yolk of an unboiled egg. Upon
this food they appeared to thrive and be happy during the voyage along
the seaboard of America and across the Atlantic, until they arrived within
the influence of the climate of Europe. The vessel in which I made the
passage took a northern course, which carried us over the banks of New-
foundland, and although the cold was rather severe during part of the time,
the only effect it appeared to have upon my little pets was to induce a
kind of torpidity, from which they were rapidly aroused by placing them
in the sunshine, in the bosom, or near a fire. I do assure my readers that

I have seen these little creatures cold, stiff, and to all appearances dead, and
that from this state they were readily restored by a little attention and
removal into light and heat, when they would ' peck up ', flutter their
tiny wings, and feast away as if in the best state of health
David Seth-Smith (1906) writes: " . . . another record is reported by
Mr. Pocock in the Field of December 9th, 18* *. He writes: ' Since the
question of the importation of Humming Birds is under discussion it
seems a pity not to record the fact that in July, 1894, eleven specimens of
Trochilus cornutus , which I presume to be the Heliactin cornuta of Sclater
and Salvin's list, were brought over on the s.s. Nile and bought by Mr.
Arthur W. Arrowsmith, who sold them to the late Mr. Erskine Allon, of
Gray's Inn ".
Before proceeding to deal with Major Pam's several importations,
1905-1907, it might be as well to mention two or three other reports of
about that time.
David Seth-Smith (1906), following a report by the Rev. Hubert D.
Astley, had some correspondence with Miss Mary Cholmondeley regarding
a number of Humming Birds kept alive by her uncle Mr. Cholmondeley,
of Condover, Shropshire, " many years ago ". Miss Cholmondeley did
not herself see the birds which she says her uncle imported in large num-
bers, but her father, the Rev. R. H. Cholmondeley, and one of her sisters
remembered seeing them alive. Miss Cholmondeley wrote: " We believe
them to have been genuine Humming Birds--on this point we have never
had any doubt. They mostly either died on the journey or soon after
arrival. The great difficulty was the food. I have heard my uncle
speak of that difficulty, but not of how he solved it. But as, in spite of
repeated trials the birds always died, I fear he did not solve it."
The Rev. H. D. Astley (1906) also reported: " When paying a visit in
March [1906] to Professor Giacinto Martorelli, the head of the Natural
History Museum of Milan ... he told me that some few years ago several
Humming Birds were kept in Milan in captivity for several months, and
that they used to hover fearlessly round anyone's face and feed from the
hand. Professor Martorelli himself saw them, and described it as the
most lovely sight imaginable, adding that the beautiful little creatures
remained in perfect health for some considerable time ".
Publication of the foregoing induced Giulie Tommasi Baldelli (1906),
of Florence, Italy, to describe the visit of a lady a month or two previous.
He writes: " . . . her first exclamation was " How can you say that
Humming Birds cannot live in captivity? I have kept them for some
time." Naturally I plied her with questions and she told me that when
she lived in the Argentine Republic she found a nest of unfledged Hum-
ming Birds and placed it in a trap-cage. The mother fluttered round it
in despair till she found the entrance to it, when she soon settled on the
nest and was captured with her young. They were fed on sugar melted
in water, but the lady soon found out they needed insects, and hit upon an

ingenious device for cultivating small midges for them. She kept a
barrel of fruit in the room, and as the fruit fermented with the heat of the
room it gave birth to numberless midges, which the birds devoured.
The young ones flourished and grew till they could not be distinguished
from the parent bird, and lived happily for several months. She succeeded
in bringing them over to Milan, where they lived for two months more and
were quite tame. She showed me a series of photographs of the lovely
tiny creatures perched on her finger or hovering over a flower, and told
me how she had nursed them and how fearless and tame they were.
They could not stand the motion of a carriage, and she had to walk from
the ship to the Hotel, holding them in the hollow of her hand ". Baldelli
ends on a prophetic note: " Who knows but that in a few years time
Humming Birds may be not only brought over, but bred and reared in
Europe? "
Possibly just a few of our members will remember the excitement that
must have been caused by the series of importations by Captain (late Major)
Albert Pam, in 1905-1907. The arrival of a living Humming Bird at
the Zoological Gardens was an event of great avicultural interest and
importance. The bird, a Bolivian Violet-eared Petasophora iolata ,
arrived at the Gardens on 25th November, 1905. David Seth-Smith
(1906) has told us: " During the train journey from Southampton every
effort was made to keep the bird warm, by placing foot-warmers, etc. round
the cage, but in spite of all care, on arrival it was in a state of collapse
from the cold; but it immediately recovered when placed in a warm place
by the hot-water pipes in the Insect House. At a meeting of the Zoological
Society on November 28th, Captain Pam gave an interesting account of
his attempt to import living Humming Birds. They are caught by the
Natives with limed twigs, and many attempts have been made to keep them
in captivity in Venezuela, but with very limited success. Capt. Pam
fed his Humming Birds on sugar and water to which was added a certain
amount of extract of meat as a substitute for insects; and this treatment
succeeded well. He started from Venezuela with some half-dozen of
these birds, all of which had lived with him for some time before starting.
On arrival at Southampton one only survived. This bird lived for a
fortnight in the Insect House, but in spite of every attention, succumbed
during the recent damp, foggy weather ".
During June, 1906, Captain Pam brought home four more Humming
Birds, all of which died within a day or two of their arrival at the Zoological
Gardens.
On 27th May, 1907, the brothers Albert and Hugo Pam succeeded in
landing twenty Humming Birds which were deposited at the Zoological
Gardens. The last to survive, a Prevost's Mango, died on 3rd July. The
Pams (1907) state that " this bird was caught about a fortnight before it
left Venezuela, and the voyage took sixteen days, we can roughly state
that it was in captivity for about nine weeks." Thirty-three birds had

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
In keeping wild doves for avicultural purposes, there is too frequently
a strong temptation to take them more or less for granted--captive birds,
if possible to be bred successfully--and little more. Whether from lack
of interest or effort, or both, their keeper makes in many cases little or no
attempt to acquaint himself with his birds' behaviour in their native
haunts. He fails to realize that even a limited grasp of dependable
background information would render their keeping to him personally,
more interesting, more meaningful, and often also more resultful so far
as breeding is concerned. Such basic background data are usually
available in ornithological literature, past and present. I am tempted to
assert that obtaining and using such information is requisite for an
intelligent and enjoyable maintenance of wild doves (and other birds)
in captivity.
As an illustration, let us now consider some more or less essential and
interesting aspects in the natural life of the Western White-winged Dove,
which is, largely owing to its prolificness, seen frequently in aviaries.
This prolificness, combined with an unastonishing, somewhat plain, appear-
ance has prompted many a keeper to characterize this species as dull and
commonplace, hence hardly worth cultivating.
But there is a good deal in the behaviour of the Western White-winged
Dove, as revealed by its life in the wild, which if known to its keeper is
likely to make him or her more appreciative of its overall qualities as a
desirable aviary bird, one to be observed and perhaps even treasured.
Such information is bound to enhance the daily satisfaction of keeping this
handsome dove and greatly to enrich the owner's experience. Moreover,
its use will lift the species out of its often unjustly assumed commonplace-
ness, lending it the delightful individuality which it exhibits.
So far as size goes, the White-winged Dove, 11-12J in. long, is similar
to our Mourning Dove (Zenaidura macroura marginella ), but somewhat
heavier. This chiefly olive-brown bird with the bluish-grey rump, the
vinaceous purple top of head and neck, has what no other dove has, a
large, conspicuous white patch on the wing. Its rounded tail has a wide,
white band at the tip. Like the Mourning Dove, the White-wing has
brown dashes near the ears and on the sides of the neck. The glimmering
irridescence of the neck and the distinctive black-and-white tail-band lend
this dove a beauty all its own. Young white-wings in juvenal plumage,
while in general resembling their elders, are paler, with back and breast
greyer, and throat and sides of the head whiter.

The White-wing takes wing rather noisily, somewhat like a domestic
pigeon. Once airborne, however, its flight becomes soundless. Male i
birds have often been observed, as in the Arizona desert where this species
is plentiful, to join in spectacular display flights. Thus, a sizeable flock 1
leaving the tops of the mesquite trees, one of their favourite roosts, will
rise forty to fifty feet above the desert floor, then suddenly set their wings
and scale around in a wide circle, somewhat in the manner of starlings and
domestic pigeons. Quickly they will return to the mesquites, there to
emphasize their presence by singing. The Mexicans call the White-wing
Dove Paloma cantador , the Singing Dove, and they have been known to
cage it for its musical voice. Usually the dove sings with closed eyes, i
revealing a blue eye-lid, and with closed beak, in other words through the i
nose! The White-wing's song has been interpreted variously, and has :
been praised as being sonorous, pleasing, and musical. Some of the I
notes have been translated as " Who cooks for you? ", " Cooks for two ",
and " Cook-kara-coo ". No two observers interpret the song or songs;
alike. While singing, the male will throw his wings upward and forward!
above the head, at the same time spreading his tail slightly. He has two
more or less distinct songs: one rather harsh, the other soft and musical, I
and longer. Male White-wings do not sing in unison, but the final effect
of a large congregation voicing their joie de vivre is a single sound.
Alexander Wetmore, keen observer of this species, comments in part as i
follows on the song: "Although males did not coo in unison, the effect;
provided by hundreds of them calling at the same time was remarkable.;
Save for one or two birds nearby, their notes seemed to come from a i
distance, and were so blended that it was difficult to pick out individual
songs. In a large colony, the volume of sound was so profound that it |
carried readily for a distance of a mile, and yet the tone produced was so I
soft that it was not deafening when near at hand. On the contrary, thej
whole formed an undertone, continuous, and to my ear not unpleasing.!
The effect, as a whole, was most remarkable, and once experienced,
lingers long in one's memory."
The natural food of the White-wing Dove consists of berries, waste:
grain, weed seeds, mesquite beans, and some insects. Its favourite food;
in the Arizona desert with its wild, coarse splendours and lurking thirst, l
hunger, and other enemies, is the juicy, scarlet-skinned fruit which the
Indians call pitahaya. Moreover, in season the purple drupes of the
spiny shrub Condalia spathulata , as well as the fruits of the giant cactus 1
saguaro, which lifts its enormous branches more than thirty feet into the I
sun-drenched desert air, are very much to the White-wing's liking.;
Fields of barley and wheat, recently cut, attract this bird in immense 1
numbers, especially where the stubble was cut high, thus providing&apos;
shelter for the foraging doves. While feeding, they are alert to the
slightest movement round about. Comments Dr. Wetmore, well-known
authority: "At times I crawled up under the shelter of woods to watch

the White-wings at close range. If one of the feeding birds happened
to notice some slight motion, the heads of all were up in an instant and all
 |remained stockstill, while in a minute or so, they flew off hastily in sudden
alarm . . . When wheat was not threshed shortly after it was cut, these
doves often caused serious damage to the grain in the shock. This was
particularly true in the case of isolated fields that remained after the
surrounding crops had been harvested and removed. For this reason
the White-wings were in bad repute among many ranchers." For a time
their destruction by hunters and ranchers assumed such proportions as to
threaten extinction of this splendid species. Fortunately, it was saved
from this unhappy fate by the enactment of the Federal Migratory Bird
Law, which regulates the hunting season and otherwise protects this
dove. Being migratory, the White-wing is today kept by aviculturists
by special permit.
In nature, the White-wing Dove nests in shrubs and trees at an average
height of ten feet, exceptional cases ranging from four to twenty-five feet.
It prefers mesquite wherever available, but will use willow r and even
cottonwood trees. A brooding White-wing is extremely cautious, seldom
tolerating a man's approach as close as fifteen feet before taking sudden
flight. Grass, weed stems and sticks, and straws provide the nest materials.
Two eggs, varying in colour from a rich, creamy buff to a pale, creamy
white, or almost all-white, are incubated approximately eighteen days,
both parents apparently taking part in the incubation. The nestlings,
almost black and covered with long, straggling down, are fed by regurgita-
tion. At the age of only four days, they receive in addition to the pigeon
" milk " solid, undigested seeds. Usually they will leave the nest when
they are between three and four weeks old, perching for several days in
the thin shade of the mesquites, then gradually running about on the
sandy desert floor. They seem not to suffer from an often heavy infesta-
tion of ticks, which are rarely found on mature birds.
Once the young are well-grown, they will congregate with their elders
in large flocks; seven hundred and more have been observed in a single
flight, flying from the feeding grounds to the waterholes. At a steady
pace they will make a 6o-mile flight daily. It is claimed that no bird
except the Jacksnipe has so zigzagging a flight as the White-wing Dove,
which therefore is difficult to shoot.
In captivity, once accustomed to its keeper and surroundings, the
White-wing Dove, when treated with patience and consideration, will
breed quite readily. A variety of wild-grass seeds, as well as milo and
millet, with the addition of the usual bird grit, will keep this lively bird
in good health and breeding condition. It has been crossed successfully
with other doves.

Cliche though the title be, it has not been given without reason. Howj
it has come to be applied to the Crowned Hawk-Eagle Stephanoaetusl
coronatus in the first instance, or by whom, is probably not precisely!
known; but it is said to be a name certain African tribes have given to it.I
The Leopard is a sinister beast who hunts by stealth the monkeys and;
other animals on which it feeds and this species of eagle has a similar
reputation.
It is a bird that lives in well-wooded country, even heavy rain forest;!
but is seldom found in open savannah. There are other African eagles to
be found in this latter but these would not make their homes in such heavy !
bush or forest as the Crowned Eagle might choose. On the other hand:
it is quite easy to find country where any species can, and does establish ji
itself. In Kenya Mr. Leslie Brown has ideal opportunities to study!
several types of eagles, large and small as well as Peregrine Falcons all:
within moderately easy reach of each other. His book on eagles, and:
his writings on the Crowned Eagle in The Ibis make very interesting!
reading, for his careful observations have given him a wide knowledge!
of intimate details about the life of these birds.
It can be safely said that the species is to be found in any part of AfricaI
where the habitat is right. One must not expect to meet it in arid places!
or where intensive civilisation has taken control, but broadly speaking one!
can say that where there are monkeys of a tree-living type, there one may
well find the Crowned Eagle not too far away. This is not to say of course !
that the eagles must have monkeys, but it is a fact that monkeys and these
eagles prefer the same sort of country. Leslie Brown tells us that the
individuals with whom he is particularly familiar prefer suni--a small:
type of antelope--as their principal quarry. On the other hand the ones!
the writer has had under observation definitely kill more monkeys than
anything else, as far as one can see from remains at the nest.
The hunting behaviour of this bird in general terms is very similar to
that of a Goshawk. That is to say the bird will have a territory in which ;
there will be a number of favourite " stands " from which it can cover a
good deal of ground by observation. On each of these perches the eagle;
will spend time watching for movement. If there is nothing of interest
in sight after a period of patient, silent scrutiny it will fly on to another;
stand and try again, and so the round of its territory will be covered.
At some point there will be a sign for which the bird has waited, and the
turning of a dead leaf on the forest floor will show the patient watcher
that the prey for which it is looking is stirring underneath, unaware of the j
murderous predator's presence.

The eagle, if an old or incapacitated bird, or if it is inordinately hungry
will not always wait to identify the cause of the movement and will launch
its attack unwisely. I suspect that possibly quite a number of them meet
their end by attacking such a thing as the tip of a leopard's tail, or other
animal which can well prove too much for the bird. Eagles and other
predatory creatures do not as a rule die of old age: they die of accident,
poison, shot, trap, or are victims of their own indiscretions. For example,
the Martial Eagle, which is similar in size and strength to the Crowned
Eagle--although with a much greater wingspan, will sometimes interfere
with lions on a kill and " mob " the killer. The lion will not put up
with these attentions for very long and will spring into the air and strike
at its tormentor. If the eagle has misjudged its stoop and happens to
fall foul of one of those slashing blows it may fly away but in all probability
it will soon succumb to the injuries received and die. There is seldom
room for repentance of folly or mistake in Nature's book of rules.
A troop of monkeys in a tree are ever on the watch for the approach of
an enemy. So the eagle early learns the value of strategy in its use of
cover when flying to outwit the vigilance of its prey.
There was an occasion in Rhodesia when my own Crowned Eagle was
carried forth for what I hoped would be a day's sport early on in her career.
I and my three companions climbed one of those peculiar piles of vast
rounded boulders known as " kopjes " which are a feature of that splendid
country. We hoped to see some monkeys to give the eagle a good trial
over the kind of country where she might easily be hunting if she were a
wild bird. Sure enough a troop appeared on the other side of a vlei
in the tree-tops about a quarter of a mile away. Tiara saw them as soon
as she was unhooded and started from my fist in fine style. However, at
the first beat of her wings the monkeys hurriedly scrambled down the
trees and vanished from our sight. Tiara arrived on the scene a few
seconds too late and pitched on a dead bough which stood convenient to
her and we could see her clearly looking about her in a puzzled fashion.
She was at this time completely without experience.
I left her in her tree while we hastened down the kopje and ran as well
as we could across the intervening vlei to the kopje on which the trees
grew where the monkeys had lately been disporting themselves. I could
see Tiara still on her stand but there was neither sight nor sound of her
intended quarry. All had decamped, but where had they gone? This
clump of trees was somewhat isolated and their nearest neighbours were
a hundred yards away. I think those monkeys were probably all hiding
either in the rocks, or perhaps a hollow tree of which they had fore-
knowledge. Certainly they were " not at home ", so I called Tiara down
to the fist and carried on with our walk.
The passing of time showed her that she had to be much more subtle
in her approach to living wild things and she learned the importance of
" using the ground " to get the advantage of surprise in her attack.

One might ask how it is that she was so easily outwitted. The answer
lies in the fact that human training of a bird of prey falls very far short of
the training she would receive in the wild state from her parents. For one
thing, the adult birds keep on feeding their offspring for a much longer
period than would Golden Eagles and the young bird is not driven away
from the nest area possibly for as long as a year or more. A lot depends
on the readiness of a good food supply. If food becomes short for any
reason the young will not be fed by the parents as they feel the pinch
increasingly themselves. Consequently the young bird is earlier induced
to wander afield and forage for itself, thus speeding its own independence.
If food is plentiful the young tend to keep reliance on their parents.
This matter of food availability controls the breeding to the extent that if
prey is not easy to find, the adults will often not receive sufficient stimulus
to set about home-building at all.
If, however, nesting is completed and eggs are laid, usually only one of
two eaglets will survive for very long. The reason for this is that the
stronger will eat the weaker as soon as it is capable of carrying out the
necessary murder. Or, sometimes the parents themselves will kill one
chick in order to feed the other! Or one will die because the other is
more importunate in its demands for food than the first, and as this one
gets weaker from lack of sustenance, so it is more likely to get ignored at
feeding time. Nature does not concern herself with the weak or ailing:
she is only interested in the survival of the strong.
"To him that hath, shall be given more, so that he shall have abundance;
but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that he hath." The
inexorable law of life in the wild!
Crowned Eagles build a nest of branches and sticks high up in a big
tree. At first it may measure only about four feet in diameter but every
time it is used other material is added until the size reaches enormous
proportions over the years. It may not always be the home of Crowned
Eagles: in some years it may be borrowed by someone else and adapted
to serve their own family requirements. Certain well-known nests or
eyries have been regularly occupied for very many years by generations
of eagles of different kinds.
The nests with which I am acquainted are all situated in big trees
growing out of the banks of streams and are sited so that they are sheltered
from strong sunlight but overlook a wide area of country of fairly well-
wooded character. The immediate neighbourhood consists of riverine
vegetation: tall mountain acacia, brachystegia, various figs and a good thick
undergrowth of tangled thorn and long grass. Huge lianas twist and turn
about the forest floor and stretch up their tendrils into the foliage above
where they are used by all the arboreal people who might find them of use
as swings, perches or for any of a thousand purposes to suit their whim.
But I have never seen any of these lianas in the trees holding a Crowned
Eagle's nest. Moreover, all these trees are difficult to climb, and I wonder

if this is a feature taken into account when the nest site is decided. I do
not know. But I feel the density of foliage in the tree is of some
importance. None are thickly shaded, but all are covered well enough to
prevent the full glare of the sun from reaching the nest. Even in my
garden in England where Tiara lives on a ring perch I have to provide
shade in the summer from what passes for sunlight, or she very soon
shows signs of getting restive and uncomfortable.
In the wild state much of the heat of the day is spent sitting in a shady
tree and looking at the landscape. As appetite makes itself felt the eagle
turns its attention to the task of finding a meal. When conditions are
right and the first breeding urges stir, the pair will spend much time
soaring at a vast height together in the cool air. They indulge in much
aerial play by stooping at each other and rising again on a thermal current.
This behaviour may go on for several weeks before any serious attention is
paid to nesting. Then a few repairs are made to the nest and some new
green leaves brought to the site and the male starts presenting the female
with food at the nest. If all goes well, mating will take place and serious
family affairs proceed. If for any reason the sequence of events is
seriously disrupted it is likely that no breeding will take place until much
later in the year or even not at all.
But let us get acquainted with this very magnificent bird. In size it can
be compared with a Golden Eagle, but this statement has to be qualified.
The Golden Eagle's wing is longer, but it is much less broad. Its tail is
much shorter and its feet are not as powerful as those of the Crowned
Eagle. In weight the two are probably very similar, but in character,
mode of life and behaviour they are very different. The Crowned Eagle
is really best likened to an enormously overgrown Goshawk. All its
behaviour is like that of a Gos: it hunts and kills in just the same way and
it has the nervous temperament of a Gos. Unlike the Golden Eagle the
young bird is very different in appearance from the adult and in its first
year it is a very beautiful bird indeed.
The head is creamy white with a few dusky feathers on top; and pro-
truding from the crown and nape is a pronounced crest of broad, not
over-long feathers each with a black spot near the end. This crest is
raised at the slightest disturbance and becomes a lovely tiara when fully
spread. It serves as a means of any emotional expression whether excite-
ment, anger, fear or threat and is frequently accompanied by an extreme
belligerence in demeanour.
The mantle, scapulars, wings and tail are a beautiful grey with each
feather tipped with white and with a black subterminal patch. The tail
has five black bars and the primaries and secondaries also are similarly
marked.
The breast is creamy white with the centre of each feather warm buff.
This colour becomes stronger under the wings where the smaller coverts are
orange-chestnut. The larger underwing coverts are white with a black spot

in the terminal centre of each and the underside of the flight feathers
have a silvery quality between the black bars. The belly and undertail
coverts are creamy white with a few small dark markings, especially on the
flanks. The " trousers " are white with heavier dark markings.
The adult plumage compared with the glory of the first year bird is very
disappointing! It is acquired fully after three moults when the bird
is in its fourth year. The head is now dark brown, with the crest white
at the base and tip but otherwise appearing mainly black when not erect.
Then it is distinctly black and white. The sides of the head and throat
appear greyish dark brown. This deepens in colour until the breast and
back and all the wing-coverts on the upper side are glossy black. The
tail is still grey but the bars are now only four and much broader. The
primaries and secondaries are now mostly grey with black ends.
The belly is closely, heavily barred black and white with a suggestion
of rufous colouring on the pale parts. The feathers of the heavily
muscled, powerful legs are now closely spotted and barred with black and
white. Under the wings the coverts are now much deeper rufous in
colour, and the flight feathers are less heavily barred on their white
ground with black than are those of the juvenile. The bill is not long,
but strongly curved and black in colour. The eyes are pale greenish-ivory
colour and the gape and feet are rich bright yellow. Cere is black not yellow.
The toes are short and immensely powerful with fearsome talons that
perfectly set the bird off for the killer it is.
This, then, is a somewhat sketchy portrait of the lady I take up on my
fist every day. She is now nine years old and has been with me since the
February day in 1961 when I picked her up from underneath a bush.
She had thought to hide from unknown, discordant noises, and disturbing
happenings that had suddenly surrounded her lofty home in the great tree
by a dried up stream.
For some ten days previously strange things had occurred. She was
at an age when eagles take a keen interest in their environment. The
great birds she knew as her parents no longer spent much time in the
eyrie-tree, but she could see them as they circled in the air at a great height
and once or twice a day they came in and dropped the mangled corpse
of a monkey or a rock hyrax on the well-trodden platform of the nest
before taking to the air again. If their visit was in the evening they would
not fly far, but would go to one of their favourite look-out points across
the valley and spend a leisurely half-hour preening before retiring to their
roosting places.
But if they came at all in the morning it would be early, and then they
would fly away to spend the day either sitting in a leafy tree or soaring
together, watching the disturbing things that were happening in the
vicinity of their nest far below.
The eaglet also watched. Men were moving about near the tree and a
strange unwelcome shape began to rear its height not far away. However,

at this age eagles are philosophical birds and as matters appeared to settle
down again and the unwelcome noises stopped, so she ceased to feel any
alarm and returned to her routine of exercising her young, but nearly
full-grown wings. Much of her time was spent just gazing about her, or
in preening, or in ridiculous attempts to catch the hordes of flies that
covered the rotting carcase of a monkey brought the morning of the
previous day. Occasionally she would leave the nest and settle for a
while on a convenient branch in a nearby tree. Then she would indulge
in a fine exhilarating period of furious wing-flapping. This would be
followed by a time of sleep in the heat of the day and only the buzzing of
the insect hordes gave her any annoyance. So she passed her time and
continued to grow in strength and beauty.
The man who had built a pylon hide near the nest in order to photo-
graph the birds was puzzled because in several days of regular work in
his hide he had not had so much as a glimpse of the parent birds. He
badly wanted to see them because he was unable to identify the nestling,
and he felt that a good photograph of the adults would help to establish
the species. He himself was a keen photographer, but laid no claim to
ornithological knowledge.
At this time I was fortunate enough to enjoy the hospitality of the Queen
Victoria Museum and was living in a flat within the building. People
came to see me, and word got round of my interest in birds of prey and
falconry. Thus it transpired that a Mr. Nicholl of South Africa who was
taking a holiday in Rhodesia dropped in one day to tell me of a large nest
he had found and was trying to photograph.
" But ", he went on, " in about ten days of work in my pylon hide I
have not seen the adult birds at all! What do you make of it? "
Now it is a deplorable fact that birds of prey are regarded generally as
harmful by those who know little about them, and I had listened to many
sad tales of beautiful birds like a Honey Buzzard, who was shot at once
because " ... it was after our farm stock." A Honey Buzzard!--a bird
which eats wasps' grubs and scarcely ever kills anything bigger than a
mouse! (Incidentally this was only the second or third record of this
bird in Rhodesia.)
So, I concluded that whatever the species of Mr. Nicholl's birds, there
was a possibility of its being a case of " parents shot or trapped; youngster
starving in the nest."
I told my visitor that I would come out and collect the young bird as
soon as I could arrange transport. I was assured it would not be
easy as the tree was enormous and, in his opinion, unclimbable. But I had
heard this before about cliffs and trees and felt quite confident we could
get up without too much trouble.
A day or so later I managed to borrow a friend and his motor car to come
and help with the project. We travelled north a long way and through the
" bush to a farm where the nest was. A walk of about half-a-mile

from the farmer's house brought us to the dried up stream which drained
from the thickly wooded hills above. Then we came out to a grassy
valley floor, and there across the stream-bed stood the tree. A mighty
tree it was too! At the base, which as I have said grew from the bank of
the stream, the thickness of the bole was about eight or nine feet and
smooth. The first branches were at about sixty-five feet from the
ground and there in the crutch of these great limbs was a cartload of
branches and sticks. Protruding over the edge was a grey and black tail,
all we could see of the occupant of this arboreal castle.
I had purchased a rope and a ball of string that morning, and the idea
was that I would tie the string to a stone and throw this over one of the
branches. Then the end of the rope could be attached to the other end
of the string and hauled over the branch to provide a means of climbing
up the tree. This was a splendid idea--and utterly useless! Because the
grass was so long the string would not run and the stone could not be
thrown over the branch! A conference followed, and it was decided to
try other methods, but before we evolved a satisfactory plan of assault on
the fortress, the eaglet, now thoroughly alarmed, decided to leave the
scene of her own accord. She spread her broad wings and sailed away
across the valley to pitch on the ground under a thorn bush. Fortunately
Mr. Nicholl had seen her leave and shouted the news. We were able to
mark the exact spot where she pitched and walk up cautiously to her
hiding place. She made no attempt to defend her virginity other than to
open her beak and gape at me as I slipped a hand underneath her wing
and took a firm hold upon her legs. (It is a rule you may ignore at your
peril, that when handling a bird of prey that is unused to human usage,
it is well to get hold of the legs, well above the ankles. Confined thus she
cannot do any serious harm to the handler, and, what is far more important ,
she cannot seriously damage herself!)
It is an interesting thing about this species that the young do not
apparently try to strike out at intruders as would a nest of Goshawks or
Golden Eagles at a similar age. I found exactly the same behaviour in
another young bird of the same species some months later at a different
eyrie. Neither made any attempt to defend itself, but both flew away
when first disturbed and hid in long grass on the ground.
So my sensible precautions against those formidable feet being un-
necessary I wrapped her in a sack and conveyed her back to the farm-house.
There some temporary jesses were fitted on her legs and we prepared for
the long drive back to Salisbury.
Tiara soon named herself by raising her beautiful crest on the slightest
pretext. I was given facilities to keep her in a small secluded yard where
she could hear all that went on in the Museum grounds but was free from
interference. I obtained an old broken bed on top of which I piled a
nest of sticks and green leaves. Here she would sleep lying down, for

although she was all but full-grown she had not developed the art of
roosting on a perch.
Normally with a young bird of prey one would not attempt to start any
training until all the feathers are fully grown and, as we say, " hard-
penned." But to my astonishment on the morning after her first night
she jumped to my fist without any of the normal inducements of proffered
food, and stood on the glove like a veteran trained hawk! Nothing like
this had ever happened to me before in many years of experience in
handling hawks and eagles both young and wild-caught. I had brought
her some meat in my satchel, intending to tie it down on the " nest " for
her to investigate at her leisure, but now I produced it from the bag and
offered it to her on my fist. She fed well and with no hestitation. I felt
her breast-bone to see if she was thin and therefore inordinately hungry;
but no, she was full of flesh and had obviously been very well fed by her
parents. Here I must say the idea of her parents having been shot or
otherwise having come to grief was dispelled as soon as I had seen Tiara
properly after her capture. These eagles are very secretive in their habits,
and when their offspring becomes capable of tearing up food for itself,
they do not spend over much time at the nest. They deliver the goods and
decamp although they may be in the vicinity most of the time. I had
seen them soaring at a height while we were engaged in the taking of the
eaglet. My friend Mr. Nicholl had undoubtedly been watched carefully
by the eagles while he was building his hide and they knew whether he
was there or not, and chose the times of his absence to swoop in to the
nest, drop a monkey and leave. This is the reason for his not having
seen them during his ten days in the hide.
So I now possessed a young Crowned Hawk-Eagle very nearly full
grown and showing the most amazing readiness to co-operate with me.
I gave her five weeks to complete the growth of her feathers, with as
much good food as she wanted to eat, and then her serious training was
begun. It must be understood that she was intended to be used for falconry.
She was not to be a pet or something to be produced at exhibitions or
shows; she was to be taught how to live the normal life as far as possible
of a wild eagle. The shows, television appearances, lectures, etc., have
come into her life inevitably, but she is today fully competent to be taken
out and released in the wilds where she would have to look to her own
needs and safety. She is a killer who knows her own ability, and I have
carefully tended her over the years to make certain of her good health, and
welfare.
The only disappointment I have suffered lies in the fact that Britain is
becoming increasingly difficult as a country in which to fly a large eagle
regularly at wild quarry. Her opportunities are all too few, and the day
may well come when I shall have to take her back home, cut her jesses off
and whistle her down the wind. There has to be an end of all good things
and I simply trust the end need not be yet.

FEEDING BIRDS OF PREY (AND OTHERS)
IN CAPTIVITY

By Owen D. Long (Salisbury, Rhodesia)
There are probably as many ideas and diets for feeding birds of prey
as there are species, and whilst I do not train birds for falconry, and have
no argument with the food used by those who do, an article in a recent
issue of a bird magazine about a Kestrel being fed on minced meat leads
me to think that it is time something was said on this subject.
I have not had a vast number of years experience of rearing raptors,
but during the last five or six years I have cared for some 40 or so of these
birds, ranging in size from a Secretary-Bird, down to a Little Banded
Goshawk. All of these birds have been found in need of attention, some
with broken wings or legs, and some that have had rough treatment of
one sort or another. Some died as a direct result of their injuries, but
none has done so from malnutrition (with the one exception mentioned
later).
At this moment I have a Wahlberg's Eagle which was reared on minced
meat from the time it was taken from its nest by a misguided schoolboy.
It was then, so the story goes, only four or five days old, and finally when
I was asked if I could do something about it, it was about three months
old, and I was presented with a bundle of feathers that looked as much
like a bird as an egg does.
On enquiring as to when it had last eaten, I was told that it had taken
no food for at least three days. This seemed most odd, for its crop was
full, but upon opening its beak, the stench that came out was frightful.
I managed to get a finger down its throat and pulled out two golf-ball
size masses of putrifying minced meat. At this age the bird could not
stand, and was disinclined to move at all, so it was put into an open box
and fed about six times a day on fresh ox heart. I was tempted to put
it out of its misery, but decided to experiment with vitamins and minerals,
etc., just to see what could be done.
In this part of the world we are fortunate in having an excellent source
of minerals and vitamins for animal consumption. VETEREX is a
multi-vitamin and trace element complex, suitable for all birds and animals.
I cannot speak for the animals, but as far as the birds are concerned,
it is for me, indispensable. I would at this point like to make the usual
comment that I have no connection with the manufacturers of this concen-
trate. I am sure that equally effective products are made elsewhere, but
for comparison I give the listed components that make this " muti "
so efficient.
All my hawks, etc., are fed on raw ox-heart from which all traces of fat
have been removed. This, together with the Veterex keeps them in near
perfect condition, and I am sometimes fortunate enough to see those
that I have been able to release, after a period of several months, looking

none the worse for their enforced captivity. The Veterex is diluted with
water (about one part Veterex to ten/fifteen parts of water), and the
solution is injected into the meat.
Subjected to this somewhat monotonous diet, my Wahlberg started to
gain weight and strength, and after a month it was able to shuffle around
its enclosure, but was obviously going to be permanently grounded with a
severe dose of rickets in one wing. However, she is now three years old,
and can easily jump on to her perch, and from there, in zero wind con-
ditions can manage to fly fifteen feet or so, but alas, always in a downward
direction.
Finding that ox heart made such an efficient foodstuff, I decided to
see what would happen when fed to other birds. I would point out here
that I run, in a small way, a hospital for any bird that is found injured or
in need of attention, and in consequence I have the opportunity to
experiment with ox-heart on a variety of species. Needless to say, the
seed eaters are not included, but any bird which is known to include
" meat " in its diet, and which comes my way, is induced to try out
ox-heart. Indeed, one Hoopoe would eat nothing else, so much so that
when there was a temporary shortage of ox-heart a few months ago, I
could find nothing that it would eat, including its natural food, and I am
sorry to relate that it died of starvation. In this case, even forced feeding
ended in failure, for everything so fed was regurgitated in a matter of
minutes. Shrikes, Babblers, Bulbuls, and many others who are known
to include meat in their diet have been successfully fed on ox-heart and
released when mended.
Gold, Silver and Ring-neck Pheasants also appear to flourish when fed
a little finely grated ox-heart, and since trying out this food, the proportion
of fertile eggs has gone up, and in consequence more chicks have been
reared. This might, of course, be partly due to the Veterex which is
also included with the meat. As a basic food for some meat eaters, I
believe that only a natural diet can compete with ox-heart, and as an
additional item for other birds, I am sure it has many advantages.
One other point that may be made here is that the only casting which
my hawks get is in the form of grass that is eaten along with the meat.
No casting is given at all, neither fur nor feather. On this diet alone they
moult successfully, with no hunger traces in their feathers, and the only
indication that I can see in any of my birds is that the cere and sometimes
the feet lose a little colour, and though this may indicate that they are not
exactly 100%, they never complain.

BREEDING THE RED-BILLED HORNBILL AT
THE WINGED WORLD
(Tockus erythrorynchus)

A pair of Red-billed Hornbills was imported from East Africa in the
spring of 1966. After being housed in a large glass-fronted planted
compartment for a few weeks they were transferred to the free flight area,
which they have shared since then with other hornbill species, toucans,
fruit pigeons and other large softbills. Nesting activity was first noticed
towards the end of 1966, when attempts were made to plaster-up the
entrance holes of several of the larger nest-boxes provided for the toucans
and larger hornbills. As these attempts were unsuccessful they finally
selected a small plywood box about one foot square, which had a single
small entrance hole near the top. This box was situated about fifteen
feet from the ground, just below the false roof of wire netting. The hen
remained sealed inside this box for a total of seventeen weeks during
which time the cock bird fed her untiringly. On this occasion the six

<bodyText confidence="0.99751402173913" page_id="56364485"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
eggs proved to be clear. A most interesting feature was the use of
considerable amounts of nesting material such as palm fronds, leaves,
feathers, grass, etc., resulting in a well-formed nest inside the box, which
left a space of only 8 inches by 7 inches by four inches high for the hen.
The nest was completely free of droppings, but it was discovered that
another clutch of eggs had been laid nearer to the bottom of the nest-box
and had been well covered with nesting material before the second, incuba-
ted, clutch had been laid. It is likely, therefore, that the filling of the
nest-box with material to a depth far greater than would be necessary
for the hen to reach the hole with her bill is perhaps not normal practice.
On leaving the nest the hen bird was fully feathered and could fly
immediately.
Within several days of leaving the box attempts were again made to seal
the entrance holes of the larger toucan nest-boxes. They were again
unsuccessful and the birds eventually settled for a heavy wooden box
about two feet high by one foot square which had been suspended in
the apex of the roof, about twenty feet above floor level. Both birds
shared the task of sealing the entrance hole with the soil and peat mixture
which they gathered from the floor of the free flight. They were not
observed to use the clay which was provided for them. The material
removed from the box after their first attempt at nesting revealed that the
rock-hard dried mud contained numerous small pieces of grass and palm
fibre. Droppings were not observed to be used in the basic sealing of
the entrance hole to the stage where the hen could just squeeze in.
It was thought that egg-laying was completed prior to the hen being
sealed into the box for incubating the clutch, as for several days beforehand
she had entered the box for a short time daily. The final sealing of the
hole was completed by the hen from the inside, until a narrow slit
approximately two inches high by half an inch wide remained open. The
cock bird was again most conscientious, feeding the hen with the choicest
foods before he ate. The insectile and minced beef mixture used widely
in the Winged World and insects were favoured, fruit being fed very
sparingly. Droppings were ejected through the entrance hole.
From the strange behaviour of both the cock bird and the hen inside
the box, it was assumed that the eggs hatched thirty-four days after the
hen was sealed in. This was further confirmed by the increased demand
thereafter for live food.
The provision of ample live food was simplified due to the tameness of
the cock bird, and the attention of two members of the Winged World staff,
head-keeper Bryan Ward and Trevor Gibson. Several times daily the
cock hornbill flew down to a favourite perch to be hand-fed, and made
literally dozens of trips to the nest-box on each occasion. Locusts,
mealworms and crickets were fed in this manner, and the maggots provided
ad lib were not observed to be taken up to the nest in any quantity. After
several days the insectile and beef mixture was taken up also. The

normal method of feeding the hen was for the cock to insert the food
item just inside the entrance slit. Any rejected food was quickly pushed
out again.
The hen emerged after seventy-two days in the box, which was thirty- \
eight days after we believed the eggs had hatched. This time also she .!
was in perfect condition and could fly immediately. The enlarged hole
was quickly resealed from the outside by the parents, although the young j
were also observed to be assisting from inside the box. For six days both ]
parent birds took food to the young, which chipped away the hardened
mud and emerged on the seventh day. There were only two youngsters
and these were fully feathered and resembled the parents in every respect 1
other than in bill size, as these were shorter than that of the adult hen.
They could fly well immediately upon leaving the nest and flew directly :
to a branch some yards away. They were not seen to feed themselves for 1
some days after leaving the nest, but by the time they were five weeks old
they were completely independent of the parent birds.
The hen entered the nest-box again approximately six weeks after the
young had left it, and has been sealed in since that time---a period of
seventy-two days. From the noises emanating from the box it seems
likely that there are at least four young on this occasion.
It is interesting to note that from the time the hen entered the nest-box
to incubate her first clutch of eggs until the present day, she has been in
" solitary " for a period of two hundred and sixty-three days out of a total
of three hundred and ninety-three. During this time the only fluids
she received were derived from the moisture content of her solid food
intake, which is even more remarkable as this contained very little fruit.

Judging from the number of inquiries I receive from domestic pigeon
keepers, there is a keen demand for a green domestic breed, either all-green
or partially green. These men have seen the lovely green fruit pigeons
in zoos and in fanciers' aviaries, and also the Indian Greenwing Dove,
so frequently kept nowadays. However, they do not realize the practically
insurmountable difficulties in producing such a hybrid. Not knowing
the character and the habits of the Indian Greenwing or the various
Green Fruit Pigeons, they very naively jump to the conclusion that since
these foreigners are also called pigeons, they must of necessity " be willing :
and able " to cross with suitable domestic varieties. The main trouble
with these so-called fanciers is that they make no attempt to obtain factual
and authentic information explaining the real nature and behaviour of
wild doves and pigeons, whether seed eaters or fruit eaters. Some of

In March, 1968, three European Eagle-Owls hatched and were
successfully reared by the well-experienced breeding pair which we are
keeping since many years in our Zoo. Several of the young bred here
were given to the German Society for Protection of Nature which is trying
to re-introduce the Eagle-Owl in some parts of Bavaria. So far, these
experiences have been very successful, and the authorities interested in
this matter are preparing to release Eagle-Owls also in other parts of
Germany.
A remarkable addition to our collection of Ostriches, consisting of
Rheas, Emus, One-Wattled and Helmeted Cassowaries, and African
Ostriches were three fine specimens of the rare Darwin's Rhea (Pterocnemia
pennata ), hatched in captivity. This species which was kept in our Zoo
already in pre-war times is slightly smaller than their common relative,
its plumage is light brown spotted with white and its head appears to be
more " childish " that that of the Rhea.
So far, breeding activity in our Pelican group started only in summer
when the birds had left their winter quarters and were released on a pond.
This year, however, they began laying their eggs already at the end of
January in a part of the Antelope House where they had been spending
the cold months. Unfortunately, most of the eggs broke--due to fighting
of the birds, and one egg of the White Pelican put into an incubator proved
to contain an embryo which died a few days before hatching.

During the past few months many choice specimens have been added
to the collection, the most impressive being the group of eleven Blue-
collared Bee-eaters which were obtained from Mr. Guy Detry of Wavre,
Belgium. Several of these birds had been in his collection for a con-
siderable time and they quickly settled down at the Winged World.
Three species of Cotinga--the Scaly-breasted, Cherry-throated and
Orange-breasted, and the rarely seen White-headed Touraco have been
purchased.
Other species which have been acquired are pairs of Goulds Heavenly
Sylph Hummingbirds, Rufous-bellied Bulbuls, Red-headed Thrushes and
Lesser Green Broadbills; and a Whiskered Tanager, Moss-backed Tanager
and Streaked Spiderhunter. A small consignment of birds imported
from East Africa contained an immature cock Purple-throated Cuckoo
Shrike, and pairs of Temminck's Coursers, Gold-rumped Tinker Barbets
and Blacksmith Plovers.
Breeding has now commenced in earnest, and although the final
results so far have not been too successful they are still encouraging and
herald a promising future. Community aviaries do not of course provide
the most suitable conditions for breeding birds due to territorial disputes
and the need to frequently move birds to obtain compatible groups.
Also, many species have definite aggressive tendencies towards nestlings,
should breeding have reached that stage; and the provision of sufficient
live food when there is so much competition for it is always a problem.
In view of these problems we do not expect to achieve fantastic breeding
results.
The list of species which have commenced breeding, but have been
thwarted, already contains some interesting names however, particularly
as the Winged World was completed only two years ago. Needless to
say, in instances where the cause of the loss of young or eggs was known
remedial action has been taken. In the past twelve months pairs of White-
capped Redstarts and Black-spotted Barbets have each hatched two
clutches but failed to rear them. Southern Tree-Pies and Thailand
Hoopoes became egg-bound after laying two eggs each, but the Hoopoes
are sitting again. Roulrouls and Sun Bitterns lost their eggs to marauders,
but the Roulrouls have since produced more eggs which have been removed
for incubation. Violet Euphonias and Rothschild's Grackles have also
had two clutches but failed to rear them, and a Brown-throated Barbet
became ill with an eye infection whilst incubating five eggs.
On the credit side we have bred the Red-billed Hornbill and have a
second clutch almost ready to leave the nest, and the Green Wood-Hoopoes
have reared four young. Yellow-breasted Fruit Pigeons and the Andaman
Grackles are incubating eggs and the Sulphur-breasted Toucans are
showing great interest in a nest-box.

A Magellan Eagle-Owl, Bubo virginianus nacurutu , has been bred
in the Gardens, the parents being a bird received in 1948 and one collected
by Mr. David Attenborough on the B.B.C.'s Zoo Quest to Paraguay during
1958. This appears to be the first breeding in the British Isles of the
most southerly race of B. virginianus : in 1928 the northern B. v. virginianus ,
the Great Horned or Virginian Eagle-Owl was bred at Wargrave and the
Medal was awarded for this first success. Other owls bred are three
Kenya and one Spotted Eagle-Owls, and two Barn Owls. Great Eagle-
Owls, after one infertile clutch, now have young and a West African
Wood-Owl is incubating eggs.
Cormorants have bred again after four barren years and appear to have
two chicks. A pair of Rooks nested and hatched three chicks which
survived for only two or three days. Pigmy Falcons have nested yet
again, but so far as is known none of the eggs hatched. The Princess
Stephanie's Bird of Paradise which hatched two young ones last summer is
now incubating an egg after two failures, the egg in each case being broken.
There has been nest-building in Rufous, White-throated and Necklaced
Laughing-Thrushes, but nothing further so far.
A Spotted Morning Warbler, Cichladusa guttata , presented by G. H.
and J. R. Newmark represents a genus new to the collection. The
Morning Warblers are so named from their habit of being among the
earliest as well as the finest of the African songsters. C. guttata is said
to mimic the calls and songs of other birds and to sing for much of the
day and even at night. It is often about houses, becoming quite tame and
sometimes building its nest, mostly composed of mud, on rafters and
ledges of buildings.
A new subspecies is a Malayan Black-crested Bulbul, Pycnonotus
melanicterus caecilii , presented together with a pair of Javan Fruitsuckers,
Chloropsis sonnerati and a Formosan Blue Pie, Urocissa caerulea , by Dr.
K. C. Searle. A Long-tailed or Streamer-tailed Humming Bird (female)
has been presented by Mr. L. W. Hill and this makes a pair from which
hopes of breeding are entertained, for it is this species that first bred at the
Cleveland Zoo and later was so nearly successful in rearing a chick at
Capt. R. S. de Quincey's collection.
A Yellow-backed Lory, a Kingfisher, two Black-crowned Waxbills,
Estrilda n . nonnula , a Collared, two Violet-backed and a Beautiful Sunbird
are other arrivals of particular interest.

The Pygmy Parrots of the genus Micropsitta (olim Nasiterna) are
regarded as being the smallest parrots in the world. But which of the
six species and 13 subspecies listed by Peters is actually the smallest?
Salvadori, The Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum , vol. XX, gives
the measurements of nine species. The total length ranges from 3*1 in.
(pygmaea) to 4*3 in. ( finschi ). Canon H. B. Tristram (Ibis, 1891, p. 608)
gives the total length of a single female nanina as 2-8 in. Unless this is a
quite exceptional specimen it would appear to be the smallest member of
this diminutive genus. It is hoped that members having access to
museum specimens will examine them and make known the results.

In the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland Annual Report , 1967, p. 19,
there is a very interesting note: " Some years ago a consignment of Gentoo
Penguins bred in Edinburgh was sent to St. Louis Zoological Park, Missouri,
U.S.A., and the following account of a most unusual mating has been
received from its Zoological Board of Control. One of the Edinburgh
Gentoos proved to be a female, and in 1964 this bird mated with a male
Adelie Penguin, though the single egg was infertile. The same pair of
birds mated again in 1966, when two eggs were laid, one of which was
infertile; but the other, laid on 20th April, hatched on 25th May and the
chick was successfully reared, an interesting and no doubt unique record
of a cross between the more northerly Gentoo Penguin and the Adelie of
the true Polar regions ".

In 1957 the Council authorized a car badge. Sales were apparently i
quite good but the Society derived little benefit. The Member in charge
of sales stole silently away, taking with him the proceeds and stock. The
Society had the very doubtful pleasure of paying for the production, and
some Members never received the badges for which they had paid.
With this in mind one is perhaps a little chary of a second attempt.
Some replies to the recent Questionnaire do, however, tend to show that
there is a demand for a badge.
Design-minded Members are therefore asked to submit suggestions to
be laid before the Council in due course.
An interesting sidelight is shown in a recent note from Kumar Shri
Dharmakumarsinhji of Bhavnagar. He writes: " I have now lost two of
the Society's car badges, both being stolen by removal from amongst other
car badges which were untouched. This shows how popular and
impressive the Society's badges must be in this part of India. I doubt
whether the Bird of Paradise is recognised as such, but obviously the
design and colour of the badge are attractive ".

During the many years in which I maintained an extensive collection
of birds I never succeeded in breeding a Gouldian. This very attractive
finch, whether black-, red-, or yellow-headed is somewhat unpredictable
in its nesting behaviour. Many (or rather most, in my experience) never
show any sign of wishing to breed, but when they do start they are
seemingly often quite prolific.
In Great Britain the first to record success was Reginald Phillipps,
three young reared by a pair of red-headed, in 1891. Since then there
have, of course, been many records, but the majority are of just a few
in number. But Bernard Thomasset had 17 fully reared by a single pair
in 1915; the same hen had brought up 13 in the previous year. In more
recent years Herbert Whitley at Paignton and P. W. Teague in Hereford
bred them freely--the first in large and perfect aviaries, the latter under
less ideal conditions. Ralph Frayne succeeded in establishing a strain of
home-bred birds. It was his aim eventually to breed 100 in a year.
Whether he succeeded I do not know, but in 1935 he reported that he had
45 youngsters flying, with the expectation of more. Gouldians have been
regularly bred at Keston and Edward Boosey once reported that a
spectacular brood of nine young in a single nest had all been successfully
reared.

My best correspondent, by far, is Mrs. Lena Scamell, who keeps me
fully informed of the breeding events in her aviaries. Recent reports show:
Violet-eared Humming Bird, one young one hatched on 9th February but it
lived only two days. The temperature of the shelter was only 45 F.,
which was probably too cold. Rothchild's Grackle, three young hatched.

All three very fine chicks were gently deposited at the far end of the

Visitors to Foxwarren Park during 1925-1938 were greatly privileged,
had they but known it, to see some of the last survivors of what is now
generally believed to be an extinct species--the Indian Pink-headed Duck
Rhodonessa caryophyllacea.
Our late President Mr. Alfred Ezra, through the good offices of his
brother Sir David Ezra, of Calcutta, received five living specimens, three
drakes and two ducks, in July, 1925. One drake died as the result of an
accident and another, a month after arrival, of some affection of the eye.
In 1929 ten more ducks arrived, most of which were retained at Foxwarren
Park. By 1938 there was but a sole survivor. In 1941 Mr. Ezra recorded:
" At one time I had as many as ten of these birds, and some of them lived
over ten years" (Avicultural Magazine, 1941, p. 141). There was a
pair at Cleres in 1925, and a further two pairs reached there in 1929.
This duck has not been reliably reported in the wild since 1935, apart
from a correspondent in the August, 1966, number of the Journal of
the Bombay Natural History Society , who claims to have shot one of a
flock of six on 27th January, 1947, in Bihar; and to have seen five to eight
of them in 1948-49 on Lake Manroopa. An extensive two-year search
has just been concluded in Burma. No trace of this duck was found and
it must be regarded as definitely extinct there.

We are possessed by a Robin. Anyone who has not enjoyed a similar
experience can hardly be expected to appreciate what this means. " Fred "
was hatched and reared in a nest built on top of a cistern in an outhouse.
Needless to say the convenience was out of service for some weeks!
When the time came for the brood of four to leave the nest " Fred's "
fellow nestlings took to the woods. But not for " Fred " the vicissitudes
of woodlands, rather the prospect of a life of security and luxury: and so,
he took up residence in and around the stable-block. I say " he " but

the cover of bushes and undergrowth. " Fred's " appetite is prodigious
and truly omnivorous, nothing comes amiss--whether it be small seeds in
the dove and pheasant mixture, fragments of poultry layer pellets, soaked
hound meal, even tinned dog food--just about anything. It is generally
recognised that many birds are highly imitative in their feeding habits and
will soon learn to take unfamiliar foods if they see other birds doing so
first. With " Fred " as a guide the feeding-habits of the whole area could
be changed considerably! What, we wonder, will happen if in due
season " Fred " decides to seek a mate. Will we eventually be confronted
by a whole bevy of " Freds " and " Fredas ", all vying with each other as
scolds and " bossy-boots "? But, as yet, there is no indication of " Fred "
even considering taking on domestic duties--rather for him the life of an
avian sybarite. We have long since grown used to his scoldings and will
sadly miss him if, and when, he leaves us, even if only temporarily.

DUCKS, GEESE and SWANS. By John Welman. Instructions to
Young Ornithologists. VII. London: Museum Press, 1968. Price
20s.
On 124 pages, illustrated with schematic line drawings and 16 excellent
photographs, Mr. Welman, who writes well and wittily, has condensed
most of our present knowledge of the birds of the family Anatidae. All
species are mentioned, concisely described and the distribution is given.
It is all accurate, following the modern taxonomy and nomenclature
generally accepted today, and very suitable for young students of birds.
The author is a field naturalist and has observed waterfowl in Europe
and in Africa. He therefore has personal experience and ideas of his
own, which make interesting reading, particularly in the chapters on
general matters, especially on migrations and on " ways of life " to be
found in the middle of the book, between two descriptive parts, the first
of European species, the second of those of the rest of the world.
The first two chapters are devoted to generalities ("In Explanation ")
and family characters (" Birds of Distinction ").
Mr. Welman believes that waterfowl possess a sense of direction, not
yet known, to assist them in their flights to and from the breeding grounds,
and he is sceptical about the influence of the sun and stars on their travels.
He also thinks that birds in confinement, do not show completely their
behavioural peculiarities; he is therefore not in favour of captive collec-
tions. With such an opinion I happen to disagree as the greatest part of

our knowledge of the comportment of the Anatidae has been gained from
the observation of captive birds as proved by the classic studies of Konrad
Lorenz and others. In his great love for the ducks Mr. Welman has,
I am afraid, slight delusions in their goodness and their life habits!
There are very few mistakes in this excellent book. The only one I must
mention is on pp. 102-103, where the texts relating to the African Black
Duck and the African Yellowbill have been transposed. Altogether a
very good book for beginners. J. D.

AVIARY BIRDS. By Rosemary Low. London: Arco Publications,
1968. Price 36s.
This book seems intended as a fairly comprehensive guide to bird-
keeping for the beginner and it seems to me to be a good one. No book
dealing with so many different species can deal with them all in full detail,
but if anyone has bought a pair of birds on the impulse has also bought
this book, and consults it quickly, they will be more likely to thrive than
die. Although the title might not suggest it there is also considerable
emphasis and information on showing.
In her preface the author rightly stresses the desirability of building up
breeding stocks of both British and foreign species in captivity, although,
in my opinion, she overestimates both the threats to such of our native
species as can be bred readily in captivity and the abilities of aviculturists
to perpetuate them should they become rare or extinct in the wild. This
is followed by chapters on Feeding; Care and Treatment of Sick Birds;
British Birds; Foreign Seed-eaters; Foreign Soft-bills; Budgerigars;
Canaries; Bengalese and Zebra Finches; Mixed Collections and Ground
Species; and Exhibiting.
Under each of the " bird " headings listed above a general introduction
is followed by a list of species, each of which is individually described and
advice on its care given. It is clear that all possible species could not be
included in a book of this size and some people, particularly lovers of
foreign cardueline finches, may be disappointed at not finding many of
their favourites. I thought, however, that the author had made excellent
choice of a large number of better-known, more easily obtained and/or
more attractive species.
There are a few errors, the Red-eared Waxbill is not, for example,
" distributed widely over the African continent ", but most of those I
discovered are not of a kind likely to affect the book's value to the bird-
keeper. I would, however, take issue with the suggestion on page 68 that
its degree of tameness is the factor which decides whether a bird of the
crow kind (or any other kind for that matter) can safely be allowed to fly
at liberty. Other things being equal, absolutely tame birds are not more
likely to return than others that are not so tame; if anything they are more

likely to come to grief at human hands or make themselves a nuisance by
attacking people who annoy them! In a few points the author disagrees
with others, as when she recommends giving niger only in small quantities
to Goldfinches, whereas Nicolai, in his works on bird-keeping, is emphatic
that this species, and foreign cardueline finches with similar feeding
habits such as the Hooded Siskin, should be given niger ad lib.
The author's love of birds and willingness to take trouble with them
is very apparent. Indeed although (albeit in entire ignorance of medi-
cine) I feel doubtful of some of her recommended remedies; were I
stricken down, I should feel much happier being fed with syrup of buck-
thorn and painted with tincture of iodine (weak, of course) by her tender
hands than I should in some modern hospital with all the Marvels of
Modern Science and the surgeons waiting for the spare parts.

or at least the single hens I've kept with estrildines as " test cases ", arouse no
response as cocks seem to do? If this aspect is considered, it would seem a
possibility that optimum size plus plumage pattern (which to me did not seem valid)
could be the answer to this interaction.

any more of the apparently never ending drivel flowing between two of our senior
members of the Society. May I suggest that a duel be fought at 40 paces with
12-bore shotguns, cartridges to be loaded with if oz. of General Protein and
Stimulite Nectar Food respectively. Alternatively maroon both protagonists on a
desert island, each with cwt. of their favourite food, the survivor to be presented

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether if be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeeis, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not heresay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

(Serinus pusillus)
By Zdenek Veger (Zoological Garden, Prague, Czechoslovakia)
Lately, I have read several inquiries about this exceptionally lovely
bird, which has not been seen on the market for many years. There are
plenty of breeders who would like to have it and others who would like to
try to cross it with canaries in order to produce some of its wonderful
colours in a new hybrid. The Golden-fronted Finch is a relative of the
canary--which promises good fertility for cross-breeding. These
ambitious plans, of course, have to overcome many obstacles about which
I will inform the reader as I very often try to keep this bird myself.
First of all, general information. This bird is quite plentiful in the
mountain areas of the Caucasus and Central Asia (Turkmenia, Tadschiki-
stan, Kazachstan), in the mountain regions of Asia Minor, Iran, Afghani-
stan, Kashmir and Tibet.
Compared to all other species of Serins, it is unusually coloured. The
head, throat, breast and back part of the throat are black and on the crown
a brilliant red " cap ". The back is cinnamon with black stripes, the
rump orange, belly grey-yellow with dark patches on the flanks. Wing
and tail feathers are black-brown, edged with yellow. The beak and legs
are black.
The female has a reddish eyebrow and the rump is of an orange shade.
The rest of the plumage is rather dull. Up to one year of age its brow is
not red. On closer inspection we see the differences of an adult female
and a young male as not too striking. The young are cinnamon-headed.
The length of the male is about 128 mm., the female 125 mm.; the
wing of the male 74-6 mm., the female 71-4 mm.; and the tail is about
58-60 mm.
Mrs. Lukina of Leningrad described minutely the life-habits of these
birds. The Golden-fronted Finch mostly inhabits the middle range of
mountain regions, from where in winter it descends to the lower hill
areas of milder climate, with better prospects of finding food. Here the
birds live in flocks of about 20-30 individuals, sometimes in mixed
societies of Redpolls, Linnets and Goldfinches, of 200-300 birds, till
the onset of spring. As soon as the thaw on the south slopes sets in the
Golden-fronted Finches return to higher regions. Here they live in areas
with alternating thin birch and pine forests and mountain pastures grown

with rhododendrons. In May the pairs begin to nest close to one another.
The males, according to Beme, sing all day long, sitting on the top of a
hill, a birch or a boulder exactly as our Serins do, with their wings
drooping, turning in all directions.
Caban in Kazachstan used to observe these birds nesting, even in dense
forest growth as high as 2,000 m. above sea-level, on the ends of the pine
branches half-way up the tree, about 12-15 m. above ground. Many of
these birds ascend in the summer period above the upper range of the
forest, to 2,700-2,800 m. above sea-level, where they build their nests in
rock fissures or in dwarf pine bushes.
The tiny neat nest is made of grass, moss, thin roots and hairs. There
are 4-5 blue-white, cinnamon-speckled eggs, hatched by the female only,
the young being fed by both the parents. They nest twice a year and
then gather up again in flocks. Their food is mostly seeds of mountain
grass, birch trees and alders. While feeding the young they pick up small
insects.
The Golden-fronted Finch as it is, very easily gets accustomed to new
surroundings in the cage as well as to substitute food. Their behaviour
may be looked upon as identical with that of Serins. When fed on
birch seed, lettuce seed, poppy, niger, germed seeds, vegetables and fresh
ant pupae, they appear quite comfortable--but not for long.

I kept quite a number of Golden-fronted Finches in full health and singing
for more than a year, but up to now have not succeeded in keeping them any
longer. According to Lukina, the Golden-fronted Finches caught in the first
winter months died in spite of all care, mostly in March or April the next
year, due to absence of vitamin Bi. When administering 1% solution of
thiamin twice a week the symptoms of avitaminose decreased, but the
birds suffered from intestinal upsets.
I am sure that the cause of these failures is insufficient knowledge of
biology, mostly of the food regime of these birds in the wild. The fact
that most birds die in spring (that is, in the period when they go back to
high mountain regions) seems to indicate that they lack the mountain
climate or some of the food components therefrom. I think, however,
that the expert breeder will suceed in overcoming these difficulties.
Then at last, perhaps, we shall be able to enjoy the keeping of this lovely
bird of charming disposition in captivity.

HAND-REARING THE THAILAND HOOPOE
(Upupa epops longirostris)
By Wes Benson (Curator of Education, Consulting Bird Curator,
Oklahoma City Zoo, U.S.A.)

<bodyText confidence="0.888934714285714" page_id="56364513"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
As with most insectivorous birds, the hoopoe of South-east Asia
(Upupa epops longirostris # ) has presented many problems for both pro-
fessional and amateur aviculturists. Wild-caught adult birds are almost
impossible to get over to a captive diet of any type. Thus, the taking
and hand-rearing of nestlings seems to be the only real answer for success.
Taking nestlings from the parents can be justified provided it is done on
a very small scale and the process used for rearing the chicks is proven to
be at least 90% successful. It can only be considered as a crime by
ornithologists and naturalists if nestlings are continuously taken and rearing
is unsuccessful. Zoos and private collectors must constantly be aware of
their responsibilities to the broad conservation of all species. Robbing
nests for one's personal pleasure and not properly rearing the birds is a
practice frequently maligned by many naturalists--and justifiably so.
Several U.S. and European zoos had requested me to collect and accli-
mate hoopoes for them while I was collecting animals in southern Thailand
near Songkhla. Since the purpose of the zoos was to make an effort to
breed these beautiful birds in captivity, the conservation possibilities
seemed to be worth the risk of removing a few chicks from the wild
population.

An interpreter and I collected 23 chicks from holes in the banks of two
small rivers near our camp. The chicks were approximately one and a
half to two weeks of age and had begun to develop primaries. They
were immediately placed in a box measuring 2 ft. square and 18 in. high.
Loose fabric was placed in the box for the birds; this could be removed
two or three times a day to facilitate cleaning. A thin (cheesecloth-like)
material was placed over the box to keep it reasonably dark.
The box containing the chicks was placed in a draught-free room that was
not excessively hot. Feeding was done every three hours for the first 10
days and then every five hours for the next two weeks, after which the
chicks were fed three times a day until they had reached two months of
age. After two months they were fed twice a day until full weaning.
The following diet was given each feeding until the hatchlings stopped 1
gaping:
fresh, raw ground beef or goat meat;
calcium powder (Tri-basic Calcium Merck was used), 1 tsp./lb.,
meat;
cod liver oil or suitable source of vitamin D, 4 drps./lb. meat;
ground, hard-boiled egg (including shell), 1 egg/lb. meat.
Enough water was added to make the mixture the consistency of a very 1
thick soup. The water was eliminated after the first two weeks when the
birds were capable of drinking water in small but adequate amounts.
They were weaned to a high-protein, insectivore diet by using a few
live maggots on top of the food. Mealworms are not available in South-
east Asia, and cultures brought in do not seem to survive. Cleaned
maggots, however, were found to do quite well.
Birds reared in this fashion are now on exhibit at over 15 U.S. zoos, and
five exhibits have successfully reproduced in captivity.
For adult hoopoes, a dirt, sand, or peat floor covering has been found
best. Hoopoes apparently do not do very well on concrete or hard
surfaces. Hand-reared specimens follow the normal pattern of taking
dirt baths and continually prodding in the earth. This is to be encouraged,
and the introduction of a small number of mealworms in the dirt on the
floor will keep them prodding.
Out of a total of 78 nestlings collected, 74 survived to adulthood, and
several have now reached the age of five years in captivity. Nesting has
been observed in the second and third years of captive specimens, and one
pair nested four consecutive years, starting with their second summer.
Much of the work of hand-rearing the nestlings was accomplished by
an elderly Chinese woman who also aided me in hand-rearing three
species of kingfishers: Pelargopsis amauroptera, Halcyon smyrnensis fusca
and Halcyon chloris humil. Her home, which was on low stilts, was full
of boxes brimming with fledglings of various species. Her work, although
inglorious, has been a great aid to many zoos.

THE CHINESE CRESTED MYNAH
(Acridotheres cristatellus)

Earlier this year I had the opportunity of taking charge of a pair of
Chinese Crested Mynahs. Mr. Yealland kindly offered them to me in
exchange for some birds I had given to him, but in view of my planned
move to Denmark they were accepted strictly as a loan. Although I had
hoped to make some useful behavioural notes, in fact the demands on my
time over the few intervening months between the birds' arrival and my
departure were so many and from so many quarters that, in fact, my
ambition was not realized. However, I collected the following notes,
which were written while I still had the birds, and I hope are of interest
to members.
The Mynahs turned out to be an excellent pair, in sound condition and
full of bounce. Their travelling cage was put in the back of the car
where my two children could watch from the back seat. By the time I
had arrived home I had a fair idea of their vocabulary, for they chattered
away regularly and cheerfully. The best way to describe their noise is to
say that they sounded exactly like a cage full of Budgerigars with a pair of
Cockatiels added! Over the last couple of months it has become clear
that they were being considerate for my ear drums, and have since demon-
strated that they are capable of calling quite loudly. Their song has
developed somewhat too, although they are not as musical as the Spreo
Starling with whom they share their quarters.
Description
Although they are currently placed in the same genus as the Common
Mynah (Acridotheres tristis) they do seem to be very similar to the Hill
Mynahs in many ways, most strongly visually, being black all over with
white wing patches. They are quite large too, about the size of Jackdaws.
They are placed in the genus Aethiospar by early writers, the difference
being that Acridotheres had bare skin on their faces while Aethiospar were
fully feathered or tufted, but the two genera are now regarded as
synonymous.
The sexes appear to be more or less identical, and if my two are a pair
then I cannot yet discern any visual difference. The eyes are orange,
the bill is pale yellow, and the legs are a dull dark yellow. The feathers
of the crown, nape and sides of the head are narrow and lanceolate, but
they are not noticeably long as in the case of several allied species. The
feathers of the forehead and forecrown are twisted and brought forward
into a parody of a crest which my sketch shows much more clearly than
words can do. In fact, a better name for the species would be Tufted
Mynah, especially as some species have much better developed true

crests and are denied the luxury of such impressive titulage. However,
the " crest " is certainly more developed than in the allied species, the
Indian Jungle Mynah ( A.fuscus) with which readers may be more familiar.
The head is glossy black, with a slight bronzy green sheen. The rest
of the upper parts are black, but not glossy, and tinged with brown.
The tips of the primary coverts and the base of the primaries are white.

Fig. i.--D etail from author's sketch book.
Underneath, the bird is a dark grey-black, virtually pure black, and
there is a little dull white tipping to the undertail coverts. The tail
feathers are tipped with white, except the central pair. Immature birds
are duller and browner than adults, and the crest is less well developed.
On the ground the bird looks just like a dull black Mynah, devoid of
wattles or other points of interest--although the crest does give an interest-
ing profile to the head--and in the wild I imagine it would be very easy
to pass it by in favour of almost any other species. However, when it
flies the white wing patch becomes very noticeable, and the bird is quite
striking. When flying directly at the observer, they are reminiscent of a
black Mosquito plane, with white propellers, and from almost any angle
remind me of a black Spitfire with white roundels.
Distribution and Races
The Chinese Crested Mynah is a bird of southern China, ranging from
southern Yunnan to the Yangtse. It is also found in eastern Burma,
Luzon (from escapes or introduction), and it has been introduced into
Vancouver. In a conversation with Mr. Herbert Murray recently he
mentioned that he was familiar with the species, having seen some examples
from Formosa some years ago. This is a sub-species in fact (A. c .
formosanus ), which is distinguished by having a more developed crest.

, It would probably be listed as the Formosan Crested Mynah (after-
thought: wouldn't Taiwan be the correct nomenclature now?). A third
: race, called the Little Crested Mynah by some (they must be looking
through the wrong end of the binoculars), is found in Hainan and is
known as A. c. brempennis. It has a smaller and more slender bill, and
a shorter wing. It is not significantly smaller in body size. As far as I
can make out, the behaviour of the three races is the same.
Those readers who may have some of the pre-war bird literature on
China may find reference to A. c. grandis which is very similar, but is
separated as an independent species by modern systematists; Peters'
Checklist (Vol. XV, 1962) shows it as such. I will deal with this bird at
the end of the article.
Habitat and Habits
According to La Touche (1925), who studied them in the wild, and who
kept many examples as pets, the Crested Mynah is the characteristic
bird of the cultivated plains and lowlands of southern China. It is as
familiar a bird on the ploughed fields and tilled soil as Rooks and Black-
headed Gulls are in Britain, following the ploughman to devour leather-
jackets, etc. When the plains and plateaux are being ploughed these
Mynahs gather in considerable numbers to take the spoils of the land.
They are also devotees of the pasture land, when they will walk about in
the long grass around the cattle and grab any insect that may be disturbed
by the movements of the animals. They can frequently be seen perching
on the backs of the cattle, from which vantage point, no doubt, they can
get a better view of the field. It has been suggested that they may also
take ticks and other parasites from the backs of the animals, but I am sure
that any symbiosis that may exist is more of a fortuitous one, where the
mynahs share the same grazing ground, rather than a proper one of the
same kind of relationship that Oxpeckers have with herbivores.
Just now I likened A. cristatellus to the British Rook in its attachment
to the farmer; well it does, in fact, consort with Rooks and Jackdaws,
and also Starlings. At dusk fall, especially during the autumn and winter
months, it roosts with these birds. One can easily imagine an oriental
starling roost, with scores of these noisy birds crowding the upper reaches
of a large stand of bamboo, and sprinkled throughout would be the much
larger Crested Mynah adding its own cries and warbles to the chorus.
The thought of a Chinese Rookery, with the same admixture, seems
equally exotic.
Friendly as the Crested Mynah is to the ploughman, and even though
he can frequently be seen walking around villages and back doorsteps,
he is a wary and shy bird. If this seems anomalous, one has only to think
of the House Sparrow which is at once tame and shy. However, if
taken from the nest and hand-reared, it can become very tame and com-
panionable. It is a favourite cage bird in China, and the Chinese take

large numbers every season to be hand-reared and kept as pets. La
Touche, who kept many, said that they become docile and easy to teach,
and also become good talkers. Some writers have suggested that learning
to speak Chinese is a dubious quality, and I am sure that if the owner
were a non-Chinese speaking person he might regard it as being of
academic value only. I expect a young bird could easily master European
sounds.
Local Names
One local name for the bird is " Dollar wing ", deriving from the
outstanding wing spots, but the Chinese call them " Pako ". This
means " Eight brethren ", as they are said to fly in flocks of eight. These
are probably family groups.
Food
Like so many Starlings, the Crested Mynah is more or less omnivorous.
In the fields it devours worms, beetles, slugs, grubs, etc., and is no doubt
an extremely beneficial species, and it refrains from attacking the crops.
In the gardens, however, it is thought to take some fruit and vegetables.
Its diet is no doubt seasonal. The Caldwells concluded that in their
opinion it was a beneficial species to man. The Chinese bird fanciers
rear their young Crested Mynahs on bean curd (Ton-fu), but La Touche
was of the opinion that the best diet was bread and milk plus minced raw
meat.
When I received my pair, they were being fed on the Society's own
home-made softbill mixture together with chopped fruit and minced raw
meat. I have offered a variety of fruits, mostly in separate bowls, but
increasingly mixed in with the soft food. In order--roughly--of pre-
ference the fruits go: grapes, pear, sultanas, raisins, apple, banana,
orange and currants. The dried fruit is soaked for a while beforehand,
and it is interesting that, while the big juicy sultanas go quickly (California
Seedless Raisins are a real treat), so the currants are left until last. Soft
food is supplied in the joint form of Sluis Mynah Food, to which I some-
times add raisins to soak up any excess moisture, and one of the " Uni-
versal " grades of soft food. Both of the main brands tend to dry out
fairly quickly, especially if one buys in economic quantities, and I
moisturize this by mixing it with a little water in which some honey has
been dissolved. Sluis Universal mixed with minced beef and pre-soaked
raisins is positively devoured.
Mealworms are given daily, and a handful is placed in a bowl on the
feeding shelf. At least a handful is also scattered around the aviary,
both in the sawdust in the house where the quail scratch for them, and in
drifts of dead leaves among the shrubs. The birds are all forced to hunt
for their favourite food, and so one of their basic drives--that of seeking
food--is gratified. I believe that this is an essential consideration when

keeping wild birds, and certainly my birds seem to be very happy with
their current lot. They spend more time food-seeking and less time
getting on each other's nerves, pecking at growing shoots, etc. I regularly
turn the compost heap and take up a few dozen healthy red worms which
are mixed in with half-rotted leaves and scattered in the aviary shrubbery.
Other live food is supplied as available.
Nest
As with the Common Mynah, the Crested Mynah's nest is a collection
of rubbish--scraps of paper and cloth and tinfoil from around human
areas, and green leaves, twigs, the inevitable snake slough and anything
else which can be utilized. The criterion for selecting material seems to
be, " What any other, self-respecting species would ignore "! The nest
is placed, in a hole, inside a hollow tree, in a cavity in a house or a pagoda
under the eaves. The abandoned nests of magpies or kingfishers are
favourite sites, for which vying pairs will squabble and fight in a hilariously
noisy rough and tumble.
Fig. 3.--Nest-box with nest built by Crested Mynah.
In my aviary I noticed no nest-building intention behaviour which
was not surprising as there was no supply of nesting material nor any
nest-boxes. However, one day I cut all the grass of the lawn in the
aviary, and distributed the considerable amount of long grass collected in
a few piles amongst the bushy shrubs along the rear wall of the flight.
A few days later I noticed that a fair amount of the grass was strewn about
inside the house, and a small limp pile was placed on the top of a pillar by
a doorjamb. I realized that if they nested they would have to be returned
to the zoo before rearing any young, but still placed an old cockatiel box
in the house in the hope of recording any interesting behaviour.

A nest was rapidly built and after a few days completed. I had added
bamboo leaves, scraps of paper and iris leaves, but only grass was utilized,
and a fantastic amount was used in filling up the box. The nest was a
simple cup (see illustration) which enabled the bird inside to see out by
simply raising its head, or remain unseen if it sat tight, the bowl was that
near the level of the hole. I never saw either bird carrying grass, but one
of them (always the same one, for they had very different characters and
could be recognized by their behaviour) would sometimes hide in the box
if I stayed in the flight. No eggs were laid.
Eggs
The eggs number four, five or six (they ought to be six always to bear
out the " Eight Brothers " theory) and are a pale greenish-blue, smooth
and glossy. Nesting begins in April and most pairs are double-brooded.
Breeding
It has been bred in confinement, and in Hopkinson's Record of Birds
Bred in Captivity is the following passage:
" Butler (AGB, ii, 46): ' Russ states that Wiener bred sp. successfully
in 1875; but if he did, he has not mentioned the fact anywhere that
I am aware of. ' Neunzig, however, without any note of doubt says
' bred in 1875 by Wiener in London
Having whetted the reader's appetite, I am afraid I have no record at all
of a breeding, successful or otherwise, so I cannot offer any useful
historical information, other than the above quote from Hopkinson.
Fairly obviously, though, the species would take to a nest-box of the
kind that one would supply to other species of Starling and Mynah--that
is to say, an upright oblong box, measuring about 14 in. x 10 in. x 8 in.
from front to back. This would be adequate. However, it would need
a lot of nesting material and a couple of handfuls of straw would hardly
be a beginning. When rearing young, the adults would need large and
regular supplies of different live foods--mealworms and maggots are in
free supply now, but wild caught food ranging from leatherjackets obtained
by leaving soaking sacks on the lawn or meadow, to spiders, caterpillars,
and, of course, grasshoppers. In my experience, with birds of this kind,
the main obstacle to successful rearing is adequate food supply.

I have once observed the foot-wrestling display (frequently described
for the common Mynah, A. tristis) in which the two birds wrestle with each
other on the ground. There is a great deal of wing flapping--to preserve
some stability I suppose--and a great deal of loud and quite musical
garbling. When not actually engaged the two birds are leaping about
each other, wings flapping and obviously much excited. The male

Spreo was excited, too, and after hopping around excitedly, joined in,
but could not stand the pace and retired after a minute or two. It lasted
about five minutes, I would say, and was followed by some gentle chasing
of one bird by the other.
General Notes
They are peaceable birds, mixing amiably with birds more or less of
their own size. It would be senseless to add them to a mixed collection
containing small birds such as waxbills, for apart from the possibility
that the Mynahs might take a fancy to one (unlikely) or take eggs or callow
young (quite likely), these birds fly around a great deal and are very
active. This would keep any small bird in a state of nervous tension and
would not do any good at all. At the time of writing, my Chinese Crested
Mynahs are sharing an enclosure with a house measuring 11 ft. x 9 ft. x yft.
high at the peak, and a planted flight of 17 ft. x n ft. x 6 ft. high. This
is shared with a pair of California Quail, a male Spreo Starling, a pair of
Silver-eared Mesias, a hen Thai Glossy Starling and a pair of Roller
Canaries. Until a short while ago, there were also some Siberian
buntings. All are happy and co-habit without complication.
I do not know if the Mynahs are a true pair, and I will not be putting
up nest-boxes as I am about to move to Denmark for a couple of years,
and so will have to wrap up my bird-keeping activities in England.
I do not trust any birds when breeding, and am usually very watchful.
In the above collection the supplies of live food would have to be enough
to keep the other birds happy, as well as rear the Mynah young, if I were
to leave them all together safely. The biggest danger would be for any
newly hatched Quail chicks, which would probably be used to feed the
newly hatched Mynah chicks. Preserving such an artificial balance of
nature would not be to my taste.
That they are tough and hardy birds is certain, for mine have been
outside without heat for most of the winter. It is useful to remember
that winter in most parts of China is not very bright and warm, and in
many areas is positively unfriendly.
I do not regard it as a cage bird, but then I do not really regard the Hill
Mynahs as a cage bird either, and yet most people keep them in cages.
In China all the Crested Mynahs are kept in cages and they do become
tame and devoted to their owners. Perhaps, like most birds of prey and
parrots, they do not need free flight exercise to keep fit and healthy.
The Thai Crested Mynah
The Siamese or Thai Crested Mynah (A, grandis) ranges through
Malaysia, Thailand and the southern part of Viet-nam. It is slightly
smaller than the Chinese Crested Mynah, being as big as one of the smaller
Hill Mynahs. In appearance, it is very similar to A. cristatellus , being

black with white markings on the wings and tail. The beak and feet are a
stronger yellow than on A. cristatellus, and the crest is much better
developed. Another distinguishing feature is that the eyes are bright
reddish brown. Deignan says that it is abundant and is a permanent
resident in suitable territory in the northern lowlands of Thailand. It
would appear to be very similar in habit to the Chinese bird; wherever
man has pushed the jungle back and either put the land to the plough or
pasture, then the Crested Mynah will be found. As in China, it can
usually be seen on the backs of cattle or around their feet catching insects
disturbed in the grass. After the harvest, these Mynahs can be seen
gleaning the rice from the dry fields. I have not found any reference to
this in the Chinese literature and my birds appear not to take seed--no
doubt, they would if the succulent food was withheld.
During the rainy periods Deignan says it is a regular visitor to the
lawns of parks and gardens, feeding on the earthworms that have come to
the surface. It is a tame and fearless bird that will walk within a yard of
an observer, but when pursued will avoid capture by hopping, resorting
to the wing only when compelled to.
Obviously the differences between A. grandis and A. cristatellus are
marginal. I do not know if it has been bred in confinement at all; it
probably has, but I am not aware of any record in the U.K. I imagine
it would not present any difficulty, providing the keeper could maintain
adequate supplies of suitable food. I suggest that in all treatment it
should be prescribed for as the Chinese Crested Mynah.

By William H. Timmis (Curator of Birds and Mammals)
The Superb Bird of Paradise ( Lophorina superba ) is found over a wide
range of the mid-mountain forests and forest edges throughout New
Guinea, from 3,200 to 7,250 ft.
Eight sub-species are known, mostly distinguished by the females:
L. s. superba , L. s. niedda , L. s. feminina , L. s. pseudoparatia , L. s. latipennis ,
L. s. connectens , L. s. minor and L. s. sphinx. The species to which this
breeding refers is Lophorina superba feminina, from the Weyland and Snow
Mountains to Hindenburg, Victor Emanuel, Giluwe, Hagen, Kubor and
Bismark Mountains.
The adult male is a black bird with patches of iridescence, an elongated
cape on hind-neck and a shield on fore-breast; the upperparts are black
except for crown which is iridescent blue-green, violet gloss on central
tail feathers and bronzy gloss on dorsal cape which has lateral plumes up
to 130 mm. long, iris blackish; the bill is black, feet blackish-blue, inside
of mouth pale yellow.
The female has no ornamental plumes, the upperparts are greyish-
brown, crown dark brown with white flecks, an irregular whitish streak
from lores over eye to side of head and nape, a broad dark brown streak
through the eye, wings and tail are dull brown, wings have a broad
chestnut edge, the underparts greyish tinged with buff and with narrow
blackish-brown bars, iris dark brown, bill black, feet black.
Our pair of Superbs arrived in December 1966, along with several
other species of Birds of Paradise, as a gift from Sir Edward Hallstrom,
They were placed in aviaries inside the large Tropical House for the
winter and arrangements were made to plant and set up several outside
aviaries in order to attempt breeding.
On the 19th May 1967 the pair of Superbs were placed in an aviary
which measures some 8 ft. wide and 20 ft. long with an inside area about
8 ft. cube. At first the birds spent a great deal of time outside in all
weathers, especially the rain. They showed no signs of nesting until
early March 1968 when the male was observed feeding the hen and dis-
playing to her. The display took place in the top of a large fir branch;
he crouched low on his perch partially spreading his wings and expanded
his breast plate to its fullest extent. The cape was erected so that it
stood above the head like an enormous ruff; the long lateral feathers
practically met in front; he then danced very vaguely, and at regular
intervals gave a series of harsh screams with the mouth wide open, showing
bright yellow lining. In the Arfak mountains the Superb is known by
the native name of Niedda which is the perfect description of the harsh
cry.

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING OF THE SUPERB BIRD OF PARADISE 171
On the 19th March 1968 the female was observed carrying nesting
material into the top of the fir tree just a few inches from the roof netting.
The bird keepers were instructed to collect dry grasses and root fibres, etc.,
and an old blackbirds' nest was broken up and placed on the aviary floor.
On the 28th March the female was sitting on the nest all day and on the
30th one egg was laid. The nest itself was a deep firm cup composed
chiefly of dry grass and root fibres which had been bent and woven around
so as to make a rather neat structure. It rested on several small forking
branches, but on one side some of the stems forming the nest had been
carried around a small branch to anchor it more firmly in the bottom of
the nest. After the first layer of stems a considerable number of small
dead leaves had been laid flat and on top of this the hen had placed a
considerable quantity of dead fir needles. The male was not observed
helping in any way with the nest building.
The egg was brownish-buff in colour with spots, dots and longitudinal
markings of brown, reddish-brown and secondary greys. The egg is very
large in comparison with the size of the bird.
The female incubated until the 17th April, when egg-shell was found
under the nest and a chick was observed in the nest. Throughout the
incubation period the male spent most of his time perched directly
beneath the nest and when the female came off to feed and bathe he emitted
his harsh cry until she returned to the nest. On two occasions he was
observed offering mealworms to the female as she came off the nest prior
to the hatching of the egg. Large numbers of locust hoppers were
placed in the aviary along with wood lice and numerous other insects.
On the 21 st April the chick was found dead and had been killed by the
male; both legs had been ripped off and the abdomen had been damaged
severely. The chick was without a trace of down; its skin was blackish
flesh, paler below; bill greyish flesh, gape white, inside of mouth flesh,
feet greyish flesh.
It was decided that if the female made another attempt to nest, the male
would be removed as soon as an egg was laid. I should think that in the
wild the male Superbs have a common calling place in a definite tree where
they make their mating calls and displays. The females probably come
to these calling places only when they wish to be mated. After pairing,
the females withdraw and build their nests alone, lay eggs and feed their
young without any help from the male; he probably mates several females
during the breeding season.
On the 23rd April our hen started to build a new nest on top of the old
one; on the 29th one egg was laid and the male was separated immediately.
This egg was hatched on the 18th May and once again large quantities of
locust hoppers and insects were offered, along with the normal diet. The
development of the chick was very much like that of a Starling; eyes were
open at six days old. At eight days quills were showing down the centre

of the back and quills on the wings had begun to open. On the 10th
day the head, back and wings were feathered.
The chick came off the nest for about 20 minutes on the 5th June and
was off the nest all morning on the 6th. On the yth it was off the nest all
day returning at night. On the 10th it was making short flights from
three to five feet and by the 12th was able to fly rather clumsily the full
length of the aviary. The chick resembles the female in colouration,
except that the breast and lower parts are almost black with slight whitish
flecks. So far as I am aware this is the first time that this particular
species of Bird of Paradise has been bred in captivity.
As described by William H. Timmis, the Superb Bird of Paradise
(Lophorina superha) has been bred at Chester Zoo. It is believed that this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING OF THE WHITE-NAPED HONEY-
EATER (Melithreptus lunatus ) IN THE SAN DIEGO
ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN
By Kenton C. Lint (Curator of Birds, San Diego Zoological Garden,
San Diego, California, U.S.A.)
The Honeyeater family (Meliphagidae) is one of the dominant and most
characteristic families of Australia, New Zealand and the islands of the
South-west Pacific.

<bodyText confidence="0.9938118125" page_id="56364526"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
Brush-like tongues designed to sweep nectar from flowers characterize
the honeyeaters. Most of the 160 species are small birds--only a few
exceeding a jay in size. All have slender pointed bills and long extensible
tongues. Many are drably coloured in greenish-browns, greys and yellows.
All have ten primaries and rather pointed wings. The tail may be short
or long, as this group is so varied. The legs are short and strong. They
live in the forests and brushland and feed, as their name implies, on flower
nectar and insects.
The honeyeater's special form of food gathering, with the bird's
plumage constantly brushing on flowers, makes them " avian pollinators
They are thought to have evolved with the great eucalyptus forests of
Australia which, with other flowering trees, provide their food.
The White-naped Honeyeater, Mel-i-threp-tus-(GK, meli , honey;
Threptos, nourished): lu-na-tus-( L, lunatus , moon-shaped=markings),
also called the Lunuated Honeyeater and Blackcap, is usually seen in
small flocks throughout the coastal districts, timbered mountain ranges

and open forest country inland. I observed individuals in Queensland
and Victoria, but they also range to Western Australia and the Kent
Group (Bass Strait) in certain seasons. They are small birds 5 J in. in
length. The sexes are identical in colour, green above, white below,
with black heads and a white crescent band on the nape, giving them their
name.
We received four White-naped Honeyeaters on 9th September 1966 in
an exchange with the Melbourne Zoological Gardens, Australia, through
the co-operation of its fine director J. H. Sullivan. After the necessary
quarantine and observation period at our zoo hospital, the birds were
placed on exhibit in the Hummingbird Aviary. There the birds could
feed on the nectar formula of the hummingbirds and could also share the
Drosophila (fruit flies) and mealworms (Tenebrio molitor ), supplemental
insectivorous food of the tanagers, honey-creepers and bush-robins.
There the activities of the group afforded an excellent opportunity to
study them and to collect data on any nestling activities.
We believe honeyeaters do not mature until two to three years of age.
In our experience, this group showed no interest in nesting until this year.
Ernest Morrow, Bird Keeper in the Hummingbird Aviary, was en-
couraged to work with the honeyeaters, particularly to stimulate nesting
activities. Small welded wire containers holding coloured yarn, wool
fibre, dog hair, horse hair, grasses, fern fronds, feathers, cotton and
spider webs for nesting materials, were placed in several locations in the
aviary.
Their nesting habits are typical of most of the family in that they build
an open cup-shaped nest and lay two to three eggs.
On nth April 1968 we observed one pair of birds carrying grass fibres
and pieces of cotton to one of the hanging baskets of fuchsias in the aviary.
This beautiful fuchsia (Fuchsia autumnal ), with bronze, orange, yellow
and green leaves and small single red flowers, was selected with care as a
nesting site. Both male and female honeyeaters work in building the
nest. First a frame was woven of grass and plant fibres from one of the
wood branches. In two weeks this cotton and grass fibre nest was
completed. It measured 7 in. in length and 4 in. in diameter. It was
built 6 ft. above one of the ornamental foot bridges at the east end of the
aviary. This location was ideal for close observation.
Two eggs were laid, white in colour, spotted with reddish-brown at the
largest end. The first egg was laid on 2nd May with the second the
following day. The female proved to be a very stable individual, in-
cubating the eggs closely. Incubation began with the laying of the first
egg and was carried out entirely by the female. The male guarded the
nest and carried food to the female so she would not be forced to leave the
nest and eggs unattended. We were somewhat worried with the location
of the nest as it was vulnerable to the other miscellaneous birds living in
the same aviary.

One egg hatched on 15th May and the second egg did not hatch. The
first egg shell was immediately removed from the nest and dropped to the
ground. An incubation period of 13 days was recorded for the hatching
of our first Honeyeater chick.
The young, when hatched, are nidicolous, as is said of birds whose
young remain in the nest for some time after hatching. A white sparse
down covers the nestling.
Honeyeater nestlings are fed only small insects and nectar during the ,
first few weeks of their lives. Later they will welcome mealworms,
blueberries, raisins, currants, cotoneaster, pyracantha berries, diced |
apple, banana, egg yolk, bread and milk, the staple diet of frugivorous and
insectivorous birds. Live food in the form of fruit flies ( Drosophila
melanogaster) were seen to be fed for the first six days. We observed j
both male and female feeding the nestling after capturing and swallowing
10 to 12 drosophila before returning to the nest.
When the containers were placed in the aviary with live Drosophila the
parent honeyeaters would come to the containers and catch the fruit flies
as they crawled along the sides of the container to reach the top before
flying. Twenty fruit flies per feeding appeared to make a meal for the
nestling. We provided fruit flies three times daily for the parents, at
9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 6 p.m.
The chick grew rapidly and as we wished to record the age at which the
eyes first opened we carefully watched the growth process. The eyes
began opening on the seventh day and were completely open on the follow-
ing day.
Mealworms ( Tenehrio molitor) were accepted by the nestling from the
parent birds at the age of seven days. Two mealworms, one from each
parent, were eagerly swallowed by the chick with the Drosophila at the
regular feeding times.
No other food was taken by the nestling until the twelfth day. A
small amount of bread and milk was carried from one of the feeding pans
by the male bird and accepted by the nestling on this day. Later,
blueberries, soaked raisins and diced banana were fed to the nestling as
he grew in size.
We are pleased that the White-naped Honeyeater has successfully bred
in captivity in the Zoological Gardens of San Diego. We realize the data
collected is fragmentary in the interesting family Meliphagidae, but hope
we have stimulated interest in this unusual group of birds. There is a
definite need for more detailed observations of both wild and aviary birds
in this interesting family of Australian birds.

By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
The Great Eagle-Owl is a favourite exhibit in Zoological Gardens and
there can be but few in Europe that have not had it on display at one time
or another. And many have successfully bred it, too.
The subjoined table does not profess to be complete, not all zoos
publish their breeding results. It does, however, give some indication
of the frequency of the breeding of this species. It will be seen that
during the period 1959-1967 success was recorded by no less than 30
zoos. It would seem that given the right accommodation a pair wishful
to breed will do so, despite the presence of the public.

It is not, however, the present intention to deal with successes obtained
mainly in zoos, but to give a chronological and narrative account of events
in the aviaries of private aviculturists in Great Britain, with but passing
mention of zoos.
Before passing on, mention should be made of the chief sources of
increase at the present time in this country. The Zoological Society of

recorded many successful events. Nowadays young are reared almost
annually, with monotonous regularity. The Chester Zoo is also very
successful: the same pair have reared young every year since 1962, 25
young in seven years. The Norfolk Wildlife Park, co-operating with
the Swedish authorities at Skansen in their endeavour to re-establish this
species in the wild in Sweden, has sent six pairs of young owls to Sweden
since 1964. And mention should perhaps be made of the breeding
pair at Dudley Zoo that reared young regularly up to 1958 and possibly
later.
Bubo bubo bubo. Could any scientific name be more euphonious?
But what does Bubo mean? The name has long been in use. Pliny
used it nearly two thousand years ago when he wrote, rather unkindly:
" The Bubo is a fatal bird, of evil omen beyond other sorts, especially
at public auguries; it lives in desert places, and not merely those that
are unpeopled, but those also hard of access: monster of the night it
utters not a song, but only a groan. It never flies where it intends,
but is borne off aslant."
Bubo is a word in general use medically, but it has an alternative meaning
more appropriately applied to this owl, " to cry like a bittern
Edward Fountaine bred Eagle-Owls at Easton, Norfolk, for some
twenty-five years. Fountaine gave a full account of the period 1849-1859.
The female had been in confinement twenty years before Fountaine
procured her, but the male was said to be only one year old. They were
housed in a large cage, about 8 ft. square and about the same height.

egg-bound; and when I was myself from home, there was no one who
understood how to take them out of the shell. I could have saved the
young bird this year if I had been at home. I found on one occasion a
young bird egg-bound, which it took me three days to take from the shell.
This bird lived and was brought up."
A little later Fountaine wrote: " A pair of Eagle Owls bred by me in
confinement have lately laid three eggs and hatched one young bird.
This is the first instance that any of the eggs of my birds, produced by
individuals bred themselves in confinement, have proved fertile. The
female which laid these eggs is ten years old, the cock about half that
age." In the account previously quoted he had written: " Three pairs
of the Owls which I brought up in confinement have at different times
laid eggs and sat on them, but the eggs have never proved good."
From i860 to 1864 the story is continued by Henry Stevenson in his
Birds of Norfolk. After dealing with the earlier successes, he writes:
" In i860, a pair of young birds brought up one nestling, but there were
none from the old pair. In 1861, two young ones were brought up by
the old pair only. In 1862, an old blind female, presented to Mr.
Fountaine some time ago, paired off with a male hatched in 1850, and two
young birds were brought up. In the same year a young pair also had
one nestling, but which was instantly devoured by its unnatural parent,
in consequence, says Mr. Fountaine, ' of my putting a hen's egg under her
to keep her on the nest until she was inclined to sit, and as I forgot to take
away the hen's egg she hatched it and ate it, and served her own young
one the same '*. No young that year from the original pair. In 1863
the blind bird laid, but her eggs proved of no use. The old pair brought
up one nestling, and the young pair also had one young one, but the hen
bird pulled its head off when about two weeks old, in consequence, it is
supposed, of her being alarmed one night by the light of a lantern. In
1864, another young pair nested towards the end of February, and laid
three eggs, but from the severity of the weather and high winds all the
time there was not sufficient warmth to hatch them. Neither the original
pair, nor the blind female, did anything this year, but another young pair
had three good eggs, which should have been hatched in the end of April,
but, in Mr. Fountaine's absence, these were unfortunately taken away
under the impression they were bad. In spite of all these disappointments,
however, Mr. Fountaine has now in his possession twenty-six of these
noble birds, and has given away thirteen others at different times. They
* A somewhat similar incident is described in the Bull. B.O.C., xxxiii, vol. v,
p. xxi, and Ibis, 1896: 261: "Mr H. M. Wallis exhibited three eggs laid by a
Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetus ), which had been about thirty years in confinement,
and began to lay eggs about fifteen years ago. The eggs having been taken and
those of a Domestic Fowl substituted, the Eagle hatched three of the latter and
reared three fine birds, feeding them principally on the flesh of rats. One of these
fowls, a cockerel, was slain by his foster-mother, but the others had thriven. A
photograph was exhibited, showing the Eagle and the fowls."

are fed on rats, rabbits, and small birds. A young pair of these owls
in Mr. Gurney's aviary at Catton, the offspring of Mr. Fountaine's old
pair, also hatched for the first time in i860, when they brought up two
young ones; in 1861, two more, and in 1862, three young ones. In 1863,
three were hatched and two brought up; and, in 1864, two were reared
and presented to Mr. Fountaine, to supply his losses." According to
J. H. Gurney, Fountaine was still breeding them in 1875.
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo writes: " Our first nest this year [1899] was
that of the old Eagle Owls, who hatched two young ones on April 3rd--
this is fully a month later than usual. Both young were reared: which
make ninety-seven reared during my lifetime. Hardly any eggs have
been laid but what have been hatched, and no young one has ever died,
with the exception of one that was choked; the old pair going on year after
year having their two or three young as regular as clockwork." J. H.
Gurney (1899) says Meade-Waldo's owls " have bred regularly since
1864, namely 32 years, having in that time reared no less than 93 young
ones ", by which time the old parents were 68 and 53 years old.
Major S. S. Flower says: " Meade-Waldo told me that the female,
mentioned by Gurney in 1899 as being still alive at the age of 68 years,
died at that age, and that two, presented to the London Z.G., 20.3.1927,
had both been bred in the Meade-Waldo aviaries, one in 1882, the other
in 1899, the parents in each case being the old pair that had belonged to
Meade-Waldo's father."
An early report is in The Field , 4th May, 1872, p. 398, where we read:
" At a meeting of the Croydon Microscopical Club, held on the 17th ult.,
a paper was read by Mr. N. L. Austen, F.L.S., on the nesting of the
Eagle Owl at Croydon." In 1871 two young, a male and a female, were
fully reared. The young female " choked herself in November last with
a rabbit-bone while feeding ". The parents nested unsuccessfully in
early spring, 1872.
J. L. Bonhote (1910) writes: "the only young one I have reared is
seven years old and still alive and well. . . The old pair . . . persistently
refuse to feed their young. In 1904 she had three nests and hatched
eight young."
Miss E. F. Chawner reared one young one in 1913 from birds bred by
Meade-Waldo. The young one passed into the possession of Sir G.
Tyrwhitt-Drake. For the five years previous the hen had laid two clutches
and incubated them without result. A later young one is mentioned,
but there is no confirmation of its being reared. In 1915, however,
another young one was fully reared.
Miss Chawner, recording the results for 1928 in the Spedan Lewis
Owlery, writes: "Three eggs laid and all hatched; the third nearly a
week after the others. All went well for six weeks and a plentiful supply
of rabbit was given twice daily. But just as the nestlings had begun to
feather and were using their wings they all ' went light ' and died in a

Herbert Whitley had a successful breeding pair, 1929, three; 1930,
two; 1931, " The hen is sitting on half-grown young."
A. F. Moody says the species " appears to be a free breeder, very hardy,
and long-lived in captivity "; that a pair was bred at Lilford in 1931, and
that they " reared their young " in 1932.
J. F. M. Floyd gives a graphic account of his success with this owl.
In 1938 or 1939(F) three young were hatched and reared. They were
possibly a female and two males: the former eventually decapitated the
latter. The following year three more were hatched, but disappeared in
the downy stage.
Reference have been kept to a minimum. Much of the foregoing has
previously been published in the special Birds of Prey number of the
Magazine, May-June 1949, and " Records of Birds of Prey Bred in
Captivity ", 1955, and full references may be found there.

HILL MYNAHS BREEDING IN ARTIFICIAL
NESTS IN THE GARO HILLS DISTRICT OF
ASSAM, INDIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999301375" page_id="56364536"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">

The Indian Hill Mynah or Grackle (Gracula religiosa) is a wary arboreal
bird in the wild state in its evergreen forest habitats in south-west and
north-east India. It is widely known for its prowess as a talking bird
when in captivity, for it surpasses even the parrots in the accuracy of its
imitations. A Hill Mynah will learn to talk well only if it has been taken
from the nest while young, and since they are wary birds and nest usually
in inaccessible holes in trees, the taking of their young is often a difficult
problem. The difficulty is reduced in the Garo Hills District of Assam
where the Hill Mynahs are persuaded to breed in artificial nests. Such
a nest consists of a framework of split bamboo about 5 ft. long and 1 ft.
wide at the middle, tapering towards each end; this is thickly covered on
the outside with thatching straw tied tightly down onto the framework.
A hole is cut about two-thirds of the way from the slightly thicker lower
end of the nest, which is then attached to the branches of a tree at an angle
of about 45 0 , with the hole at the higher end and facing downwards. The
trees chosen are usually tall, and are situated in or at the edge of clearings
in the forest, or at the edge of a small village; the artificial nests are placed
at or near the tops of the trees. A Garo may have four or five of these
nests, in different trees, and by observation he can tell when there are
young birds in the nest. Usually he does not want to run the risk of
their fledging and escaping, and so he takes the young from the nest
earlier than is desirable, feeds them on a barely adequate diet of moistened
gram-powder made into large plugs and pushed into the gaping throat,
and then sells them at the weekly village market at prices usually between
10s. and # 1. Dealers then take them on via Goalpara to Calcutta.
The practice of putting up these artificial nests in the Garo Hills is an
old one, certainly much older than the recent huge demand for young Hill
Mynahs for export. It is not done in other parts of India for the catching
of Hill Mynahs; possibly it arose as a simple way of catching birds,
indiscriminately of species, in order to eat them. As do the hill people of
Orissa and Nepal, the Garos also catch the young of any Hill Mynahs they
find nesting naturally in holes in trees, but the majority of young Hill
Mynahs leaving Assam for a life in captivity have probably been hatched
in these artificial basket nests. The advantages to the Garo are obvious:
he has a good source of revenue, collected with little difficulty since the
nests are reasonably accessible (to a Garo!); he can observe the nests
easily and can take the young before they fledge; and having the nests
often near his hut he can prevent the young birds from being taken by his
neighbour--it is obvious to whom they belong. But what makes the Hill

Mynahs, which usually nest only in tree holes, make use of bamboo-and-
grass baskets is difficult to understand; obviously there may be many
possible reasons for it. But since birds which nest in these baskets
rarely succeed in rearing any young, there must be very strong selection
pressure against the habit; perhaps in a couple of decades they will scarcely
do so any more.
A few thousand young Hill Mynahs are taken out of Assam each year,
largely for export. This represents quite a large drain, but it is less
serious than it would appear for two reasons: first, that if the young birds
are taken from the nest, the parents usually nest again, and second, that
the taking of young Hill Mynahs from Assam is at present largely confined
to the Garo Hills District only. Control measures would be easy to
apply in theory, but are probably not yet necessary; they may well become
necessary if the trade in these birds continues to expand.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF CASSOWARIES AT

(Casuarius casuarius) arrived in 1963, when the birds were still in immature
plumage and approximately 18 months old.
They first mated in 1965, when five eggs, subsequently proved to be
fertile, were destroyed after five weeks of incubation due to an unfortunate
fight between the parents. Inquiries had revealed a difference of opinion
as to whether Cassowaries mated only once before the laying of a clutch,
or whether copulation was necessary between the laying of each egg, and
assuming the former as well as to prevent the possibility of further
accident the birds were separated after the first egg had been laid in 1966.
Two other eggs were laid at six-day intervals, which were then given to
the male who undertakes the entire duties of incubation and tending of the
chicks, but eventually only one egg hatched, the other two being infertile.
It is regretted that the first egg had not been marked for identification,
but it is confidently assumed that it was the first to be laid, following
mating by the parents, and that it is essential for Cassowaries to copulate
between the laying of each egg. The male showed no interest in this
solitary chick, and although hand-feeding was continually tried it died in
four days.
During 1965 and 1966 it had been noted that the smaller male bird was
inclined to scrape and scatter the nesting material placed in one corner of
his half of the hut, so in preparation for 1967 breeding the floor was covered
with a 5 in. layer of peat-moss; also, to facilitate feeding with least

disturbance, the bottom of the gate in the weldmesh partition was raised
4 in. from the floor, enabling food and water trays to be slipped underneath.
To ensure fertilization of all the eggs in 1967, but to reduce the risk of
accident to a minimum, it was decided to separate the birds when the full
clutch had been deposited, but in the end this was not done until the
second chick had hatched.
The Cassowaries started mating in mid-March 1967, approximately the
same time as in the two previous years, continuing for two weeks during
which numerous acts of copulation were observed. Then on 13th April
the female laid her first egg on the peat moss in a corner of the male's
compartment of the hut, and this was immediately accepted and brooded
by her mate. The second egg was laid on 18th April, and the third and
final egg on 22nd April. Mating was again observed between the laying
of these eggs. Though continuing to sit closely, the male frequently
cohabited with the female, feeding alongside her and even accompanying
her on brief visits into the enclosure. It would appear, therefore, that the
fight of 1965 occurred due to the female having become frightened, and
irritating the brooding male by racing into the hut.
The first chick hatched on 5th June, and it was observed that its first
meal consisted of portions of the shell from which it emerged, this being
broken into small fragments by the male. The second chick hatched on
6th June, and at this stage the partition gate separating the parent birds
was closed. The third chick hatched on 8th June but was accidentally
crushed by the male as it

In comparison with the above times it is interesting to note that the five
eggs of 1965 were laid at six-day intervals, and that the incubation period
of the chick hatched in 1966 was eight weeks.
During the first six days the chicks were disappointing feeders, and the
male bird was not taking his usual meals. The start of more serious
feeding was, perhaps, due to a chance act on the part of the keeper. It
had been thought advisable to break down the various ingredients of the
diet into small particles, but although the male examined these, with the
two chicks running round his bill, there was no serious attempt at inducing
them to feed. One day, however, while crumbling wholemeal bread,
the keeper accidentally tossed a large piece of loaf into the paddock. The
male immediately became excited, broke it down with his bill, and called
to the chicks as he dropped the crumbs in front of them. Both chicks
then began feeding voraciously. Other ingredients of the diet (tomatoes,
bananas, etc.) were then offered in larger portions, and each was accepted

by the chicks after it had been broken down by the parent. Once feeding
freely, however, both male and chicks accepted food as it was offered,
and a finely chopped mixture was prepared including wholemeal bread,
bananas, pears, apples, grapes, tomatoes, carrots, chick crumbs, grass meal,
bone meal, horse meat and calcium; in addition the chicks accepted grit,
chiefly limestone and medium oyster shell. When finely chopped, the
fruit juices formed the dry ingredients into a stiff paste which the male
broke and scattered, but the chicks quickly learned to take it for them-
selves. For the first two weeks the male bird and chicks consumed only
4 lb. of the mixture daily; by the time the chicks were three weeks old,
however, they and the male were taking 16 lb. daily, and this had increased
to 25 lb. when the chicks were five weeks old. By comparison, at this
time, the female Cassowary was eating 12 lb. per day of a simpler diet.
The paddock supplied a certain amount of natural food. The chicks
were seen chasing and capturing insects, and the male plucked and offered
them grass which frequently seemed to pass through them without being
digested. That their digestion was remarkable, however, was demonstrated
when the male was observed to kill an immature starling which had flown
into the paddock. This he tore to pieces and offered to the chicks.
Considerable anxiety was experienced as one chick was seen endeavouring
to swallow an entire wing, starting with the base, and wandering round the
paddock, gulping, with the primary feathers protruding from its bill; but
everything eventually disappeared, nor were there any injurious after-
effects though the chick at the time was only three weeks old. This
experience prompted the offering of dead mice which were, and still are,
accepted.
All this while the female showed no signs of irritation at being isolated,
nor did she exhibit any interest in the chicks when they approached the
foot of the chainlink fencing dividing the paddocks. This lack of interest
was remarkably demonstrated shortly after the chicks first ventured out-
of-doors, when they both slipped through the 3 in. diamond mesh into the
passage-way leading from the female's half of the hut to her enclosure. It
was a possibility which had not been foreseen, and the writer, who was
present at the time, watched the female step carefully over the chicks
without evincing further interest in them. The male bird, however,
became frantic, and when the writer entered the passage-way, and passed
him one chick after another through the mesh, it was doubtless his relief
at their return that prevented the ferocious attack on the fence with
which he invariably opposed the approach, not only of strangers, but of
the keeper in charge. The writer had no sooner left the passage-way,
and was speaking to some onlookers as he re-locked the gate, than the
chicks re-entered the passage, crossed it, and then slipped through the
outer fence to the public path. The visitors were amused as they watched
the chicks being picked up, carried across the passage-way, and again
presented to the male bird who this time led them out into the paddock.

It was an unanticipated event which might have had serious consequences
under other conditions, and the Park's Works Department was hurriedly
summoned to prevent its repetition by fixing a skirting of fine-gauge
netting round the foot of the chicks' paddock fencing.
As the small paddock eventually became fouled, and no longer offered a
supply of fresh grass, it was extended by taking in a portion of the main
Cassowary enclosure. The nursery paddock was then cleaned and sanded,
and in this domain the two chicks have grown up into sturdy young
immature Cassowaries. When first hatched they were clad in attractively
camouflaged down of sepia and gold stripes; then the dark brown gradually
faded till the chicks had assumed a uniform honey colour; and this is
slowly darkening till, if all continues well, it will assume the rich deep
brown plumage in which their parents were clad when they first came to
the Park. The Cassowary chicks represent the most interesting birth in
the Park since the first King Penguin to be reared in captivity was hatched
in 1919.
As described by G. D. Fisher, the Cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) has
been bred at the Scottish National Zoological Park. It is believed that
this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE GREEN WOOD HOOPOE AT THE

It was in the spring of 1967, just one year after the Winged World was
opened, that the opportunity arose to obtain a pair of Green Wood
Hoopoes (Phoeniculus purpureus) from Messrs. David Roberts Wildlife in
East Africa. We assumed from the outset that the birds were a true pair
as there was a definite difference in size, the cock bird being slightly
larger and having a longer bill. The hen appeared to be immature as
her bill was still basically black, but this changed to the adult red colouring
soon after arrival.
They were housed in a glass-fronted planted aviary in company with a
White-headed Wood Hoopoe and many other softbills including Red-
fronted Barbets, Blue-winged Pittas, Grey-hooded Kingfishers and Snowy-
headed and White-browed Robin Chats. They never showed any signs
of aggression towards these birds, and in fact seemed to enjoy the company
of the other Wood Hoopoe.

Several large rotten tree-trunks were provided for them, and within
these nesting cavities had been chiselled out from the back and then
covered, leaving only a small access hole visible in the front of the trunk.
Like all the barbets and tits for which this had been done elsewhere,
however, they scorned these " natural " nest holes and settled for a small
plywood box approximately 10 in. square, which had been suspended
from the roof of the compartment. Although the tree trunks were not
used for nesting the Wood Hoopoes certainly made good use of them,
clambering around searching the crevices for insects, using their tails in
the manner of the Woodpeckers.
They used the nest-box regularly for roosting in, and until they had
settled down, which took several weeks, they sought refuge in it whenever
their compartment was entered. Their diet consisted of our home-made
insectile mixture which is mixed with raw minced beef and is the standard
fare for practically all our frugivorous, omnivorous and insectivorous
species. They also received maggots, mealworms, crickets and blowflies,
and also raw shrimps which were provided for the Kingfishers.
As far as we could tell only the hen incubated the eggs, and she com-
menced sitting on 8th April of this year. Due to the position of the nest-
box and the smallness of the entrance hole it was impossible to see inside
without disturbing the birds. After 17 days it was apparent that some
eggs had hatched, as the hen appeared more frequently and both birds
began regular trips to the box with live food. Maggots, mealworms,
crickets and a few small locusts were fed for the first week and the raw
meat mixture was included thereafter.
Sixteen days later fully fledged chicks began appearing at the entrance
hole and ventured out two days later. There were four chicks and they
were about half the size of the adults. They had short, straight black
bills and lacked the glossiness and long tails of the parent birds, but
otherwise were similarly coloured except for having a definite brownish
throat. They were fed by both parent birds for just over three weeks, by
which time they seemed to be completely independent.
As described by Clive Roots, the Green Wood Hoopoe (Phoeniculus
purpureus) has been bred at Winged World, Heysham. It is believed
that this may be a first success.

By Clive Roots (Winged World, Heysham, Lancs., England)
We regularly read about the problems arising from feeding maggots
and mealworms to soft-billed birds. Problems which occur when these
larvae form the sole items of diet of nestlings, at least for the first week or
so; and of Bee-eaters and other exacting hawking species which are loathe
to accept inanimate foods. Almost as frequently we hear of attempts to
" improve " the quality of both maggots and mealworms by the addition
of certain items to their diet, or by dusting them with a supplement
before they are fed, without really knowing what food components are
lacking and need to be increased.
In an effort to throw some light upon this very important aspect of
aviculture, rather than rely upon assumption, samples of maggots and
mealworms have been submitted for analysis, and the results have proved
very interesting to say the least. In order to fully appreciate the notes
which follow, the results of the analyses will be given first. Only freshly
killed insects were analysed.

From these analyses it will be seen that the calcium and phosphorus
content of both forms of larvae is minute, and is certainly insufficient to
rear young birds. It is known that an adult bird can mobilize 25% of the
calcium required for egg-shell deposition from its body, and whilst it
would probably survive for a number of years upon a diet so low in calcium
and phosphorus, it is doubtful if such an intake would contribute sufficient
for the bird to be able to produce eggs. We know that Softbills seldom
become egg-bound, yet there have been two instances recently at the
Winged World when a Thailand Hoopoe became egg-bound after laying
two perfect eggs in each clutch. All other conditions were perfect and
were not thought to have contributed to that ailment. Due to the fact
that these birds were in a community aviary where maggots and mealworms
were available all day for the more exacting species, the Hoopoes had
concentrated their attentions upon these and had ignored the insectile
mixture which would have provided a balanced diet. Needless to say this
pair have now been moved to quarters where they can receive a more

balanced diet, and the indications are that we may be more successful in
the future.
The relative lack of calcium and phosphorus in these larvae could have
been foreseen anyway of course, as they do not possess the skeletal system
which contains the majority of the ash content of the vertebrate body.
The skeletal deformities and other symptoms which nestling insectivorous
birds often show in captivity are certainly due to the lack of calcium and
phosphorus in their diet, and possibly to the fact that the small quantities
of each are present in the wrong ratio, as much more calcium than
phosphorus is required to build bones. The vitamin requirements,
where the formation of bones is concerned, will be discussed later, as also
will the means of administering supplements to purely insect feeders.
The deficiency symptoms shown by nestlings which were reared or
almost reared upon these larvae alone have mainly been associated with
the feet or legs, although perhaps it would be truer to say that it was most
obvious there, as they were twisted, weak and useless. Beaks, too, have
failed to harden and take their correct shape.
It will also be seen from the analyses that the fat content of mealworms
is higher than that of maggots. The same applies to the protein and
carbohydrate content. Rather than compare the content of each of these
food nutrients separately, but as a total calorific content, it is necessary to
understand a little about the calorie values of foodstuffs. This is an
aspect of nutrition which to date seems to have been applied only to human,
and not to bird diets.
There are approximately four calories per gram of protein, just under
four in every gram of carbohydrate, and over double the quantity, just
over nine calories, in each gram of fat. When the composition of a diet
is known it is a simple matter to multiply the percentage of protein in
every 100 grams of food by four, and so on. On this basis the calory
content of mealworms is 204 and maggots 150 per 100 grams (approxi-
mately 4 oz.). Whilst not being the ideal ratio of fat and carbohydrate,
as birds can assimilate the latter easier, insectivorous species have survived
for several years upon maggots and mealworms alone. This life-span
would no doubt be extended if vitamins and mineral salts could somehow
be added to the diet.
Often we hear how " rich " mealworms are, and how sparingly they
should be fed, the inference being that this applies to all birds. Where
the insectivorous species are concerned the only thing rich about meal-
worms is the fantastic price they command. It is my contention that a
diet of a normal insectile mixture which has been moistened with fats or
oils, plus a few maggots daily, will provide a food intake far richer in fat,
and therefore more likely to cause obesity, than a diet of mealworms
alone.
Where frugivorous and omnivorous species are concerned it is a different
matter, of course, as they definitely require a lower intake of calories than

<bodyText confidence="0.998292288888889" page_id="56364548"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
the insectivorous species. The addition of too many mealworms to a
diet already containing fruits rich in carbohydrate and fatty insectile
mixtures could just tip the scales in favour of obesity. Also, there is the
over-stimulating effect which mealworms have upon many species,
particularly amongst the omnivorous softbills.
The moisture content of these larvae is very high, being well over half
the content of the mealworm and almost three-quarters of the blowfly
maggot. It is not really surprising therefore that the Bee-eaters, and other
species which are not known to drink, can derive enough moisture from
their insect diet, which without doubt they do in captivity.
Unfortunately, analysing maggots and mealworms for their vitamin
content has not yet been undertaken, as this entails a far more costly
operation. At this stage it seems reasonable to assume that a deficiency
of vitamin D is also associated with the leg and feet deformities already
mentioned. Even if there were sufficient calcium and phosphorus in
the diet to form bones, this could not be done unless vitamin D was pre-
sent to assist in the metabolization of the minerals. In adult birds
vitamin D is manufactured by exposure of the skin to sunlight.
The vitamin which is definitely absent from both larvae, or at least
present in the most minute quantities, is vitamin A. We have heard of
cases of half-closed, watering eyes, followed by asthmatic breathing and
eventual blindness and death, of Bee-eaters fed for months solely upon
maggots and mealworms. Also of similar symptoms and losses amongst
newly imported Flycatchers, often so dependent upon live food for many
weeks. Frequently I have heard it said that this is " due to something in
the maggots, probably not cleaned properly ". On the contrary, it is not
something in the maggots, but something they are lacking. This has been
proved conclusively where the exacting East African Wattle-eyed and
Puff-backed Flycatchers are concerned. A few which were imported on a
diet of locusts and mealworms defied all attempts at meating off, and were
restricted to a diet of maggots and mealworms as they would not even
accept crickets and blowflies. Obviously they could not be released,
which is the normal procedure in the field with newly trapped birds
which will not accept inanimate foods. In a desperate attempt to save
the surviving members of the group a liberal dose of Abidec (rich in
vitamins A and D) was administered direct into the beak and within two
days the symptoms of watering eyes, dejection and heavy breathing,
had cleared up. The mistake was then made of adding the water soluble
Abidec to their drinking water, and soon afterwards it became necessary
to again adminster drops directly into their beaks. It soon became
obvious that these Flycatchers, like the Bee-eaters, did not drink, and we
have since added the vitamin A to the live food. We now use the oil
form of vitamin supplement, as this adheres to the larvae better, and since
commencing this treatment the symptoms mentioned earlier, which are
characteristic of vitamin A deficiency in other animals, have not recurred.

Several methods of administering supplements to birds which are
feeding solely upon maggots and mealworms have been tried, from all
accounts. Often though these appear to have been supplements which
were intended to increase the protein content of the diet rather than the
vitamin and mineral content. As we have seen from the analyses protein
is present in sufficient quantity, and it is the minerals which need to be
added, plus vitamin A. Adding all the other available vitamins can do no
harm either. The administering of baby or invalid foods to the larvae,
both internally and externally, is not really solving the problem, as the
food items which are needed will be reduced to infinitesimal quantities
due to the small amount of the foodstuff which is ingested anyway.
The answer lies in providing purely a vitamin and mineral supplement
in a highly concentrated form, but once again administering this is not a
simple matter. There appears to be no evidence that vitamins and
minerals can be stored or retained in the body tissues of maggots and meal-
worms. Therefore if these larvae are fed upon highly enriched foods,
the small amounts present in their gut when they are eaten is all that
birds will receive. Maggots are unsuitable for this method anyway, as
their foodstuffs will be in varying stages of fermentation or decomposition
if the temperature at which they are kept is high enough to stimulate
feeding. The maggots should then be cleaned before they are fed to the
birds, which of course defeats the object of the exercise. A supplement
can certainly be added to the mealworms food, but this must be in a
highly concentrated, finely powdered form.
Maggots are more suitable than mealworms if it is intended to add the
supplement externally to the larvae, as they remain alive for some time
even when liberally coated with honey and powdered with the supplement.
Mealworms, not being adapted for a semi-fluid existence, do not survive
such treatment and are then not as readily accepted. Where vitamins are
concerned the best method seems to be the addition of a few drops of
highly concentrated vitamin oil, which adheres to the larvae, and does
not dry out as rapidly as the water bound form. Minerals in very finely
powdered form stick quite well to these moistened larvae.
Alternatively the larva can be injected with liquid calcium, e.g. Collo-
cal-D, and liquid vitamins if a very fine needle is used. Naturally the
amounts injected are minute, but as the additives will be in highly con-
centrated form this should be sufficient to rear healthy youngsters, and
will certainly fill the requirements of adult non-breeding birds. In which
case such a messy and tiresome task will have been well worth while.

As mentioned in the article by W. H. Timmis, the most outstanding
hatching during the year was a Superb Bird of Paradise. We are pleased
to report that the youngster is doing extremely well.
Other breeding rarities are Kookaburra chicks, which are still in their
nesting log in one of the aviaries in the Temperate Bird House. These
youngsters are thriving and we hope that we will be successful in rearing
them to maturity. At the time of writing the chicks are three weeks old;
they are by no means properly feathered yet and are of a rather ugly
appearance.
The Geese have done particularly well this year with 4 Barnacles, 2
Emperors, 4 Bar-headed and 1 Canada Goose hatched. Other species
which were hatched were Silver Pheasants, Peacocks, Bob-White Quails, a
Turquoisine Parrakeet, Great Eagle-Owls and a single Sclater's Crested
Curassow chick.
A newly arrived Sulphur-breasted Toucan (Rhamphastos sulphuratus)
has been accommodated in one of the aviaries at the top of the ramp in
the Tropical House. A Red-billed and a Laminated Hill Toucan are at
liberty within the confines of the Tropical House, but the latest arrival
will remain in the aviary for the time being.
A pair of Red-billed Pintails (Anas erythrorhyncha) have been accom-
modated on the Small Mammal House Pond. This is the first time that
this species, which closely resembles the Bahama Pintail, has been ex-
hibited at Chester Zoo. A pair of Mandarin Ducks arrived at the same
time and have also been released on the Mammal House Pond.
The Rockhopper Penguins have been transferred from the pool which
they shared with Jackass and Humboldt's Penguins to new quarters in the
Otter and Penguin area. They can now be viewed whilst swimming
underwater in specially designed glass-fronted viewing tanks. When
they leave the tank they develop enough speed to jump from the water
and land upright on the bank, just as they do in the wild state when they
jump from the sea on to a rocky foreshore. In addition to the viewing
tank which holds 1,000 gallons of water, accommodation comprises a
large open-air pool, rockwork caves and walks and a water slide from the
viewing tank to the main pool.

Four West African Wood-Owls ( Ciccaba woodfordii nuchalis) live
together in one of the compartments of the Owls' Aviary during summer,
being brought in for the winter, and this summer a pair of them nested,
making a scrape in the peat moss on the shelter floor, and hatched one chick
which is now flying and sitting on the perches among the others. The
two non-breeding birds, so far as is known, paid no attention to the pro-
ceedings, and the presumed father (for he seemed to take a proprietorial
interest in the nest and was sometimes standing by it) is a tame bird that
flies to the wire front on being called. The young bird is of a pale
greyish-buff on the head and under-side, faintly barred with darker
brownish; darker on the back with pale whitish spots, much like the
adults but not so dark a brown. This appears to be the first breeding in
this country. The usual clutch size is said to be one egg, and so far as is
known only one was laid on this occasion. In i960 two Wood-Owls
nested here, but as the egg was infertile they were given one from Snowy
Owls which was hatched and the chick reared by them.
An Abyssinian Eagle-Owl has also been bred, but this may not be a
first success, for there is some evidence that this race bred at Leckford (see
Prestwich (1955), Records of Birds of Prey Bred in Captivity , p. 24).
Only one Great Eagle-Owl has been bred here this year; Barn Owls have
a second brood after rearing two young in the first nest. Other breedings
include one Cattle Egret, five more Sonnerat's Jungle fowl, seven Cheer
Pheasants, two Great Black-backed, two Herring and three Silver Gulls,
four Grey-headed Gallinules and four Grey-backed Thrushes. Two
Sams Cranes have been hatched and the Grey-backed Thrushes have
young--actually their third family, for the second brood did not survive.
All three families were hatched in the original nest built on a window
ledge, and this is also believed to be a first breeding in this country.
Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise, at the third attempt this year,
hatched a chick, but it lived for only two days. She is now incubating a
fourth egg.
Azure-winged Magpies (one is of one of the Japanese races and the other
the Iberian Cyanopica cyana cooki) nested and hatched chicks which did
not survive.
A Rufous Tinamou ( Rhynchotus rufescens ), an Abdim's Stork, a Crested
Guineafowl (Guttera edouardi ) and two Livingstone's Turacos are new
arrivals of particular interest. Mr. Robin Restall brought a male
Californian Quail and four chicks. Following the death of the mother
this bird continued the incubation of the eggs and cared for the chicks.
Parrakeets received in exchange from the Melbourne Zoological
Gardens are King, Rock Peplar, Pileated and Pennant's, together with
four Black Swans. A Banksian Cockatoo received in 1934 has died.

According to a census made last year by the London Natural History
Society, for the British Trust for Ornithology, there was a marked increase
in the number of Wrens in the London area. In 413 acres of woodland
there were 130 pairs, an increase of 50 pairs on 1966; and the number in
729 acres of farmland was nearly doubled.
The Bullfinch showed a rise in number, but the Chaffinch, Greenfinch,
Goldfinch and Linnet all fell.
The three most numerous birds in woodland were Robin, Wren,
Blackbird; and in farmland Blackbird, Robin, Dunnock.

Sotheby's sale on 9th July. Included in the sale were more than a

Durham. The highest price paid was #110 for a Snowy Owl mounted
in i860. A Bearded Tit, shot in London in 1794, was bought by the
Ulster Museum for #32; a Great Bustard went to David Attenborough
for #42; and a Golden Eagle with outstretched wings fetched #14. The
total realized was #2,268. But lest anyone should think that stuffed birds
are back in fashion and be misguided enough to think there is easy money
to be made, Peter Conder points out that anyone offering for sale the skin
or plumage of a dead bird may be committing an offence against the

One of the most eagerly awaited events of the year is the return of the
House Martins. It has always been a matter of disappointment and
surprise that they fail to nest with us--that is until this year. In the days
when we were trying to induce our colony of Red-faced Lovebirds to
breed we imported a dozen artificial House Martin nests from Germany.
The Lovebirds totally ignored them and, now that they are hung under
the eaves of the stables, they have likewise failed to have any impression
on the House Martins. On the other hand, they have proved very
acceptable to the House Sparrows. But this year a pair of House Martins
did decide to nest, but in a rather inconvenient position--immediately
above the front door. This has meant that the door has had to remain
closed for several weeks. Fortunately, the majority of our visitors share
and understand our interest in birds, and are only too willing to co-
operate by using other entrances. The opportunity to study them at
such close quarters has been very rewarding. It is a pity, however, that
they have made rather a mess. They are now preparing to nest a second
time.

morning appearance. As the day progressed his absence became more
noticeable and when he had not appeared by nightfall we thought that
he must surely have fallen victim to a predator. Or was Fred really a
" she " and had gone to nest? Day followed day without any sign and we
had given him up for lost when, after nearly three weeks, he reappeared.
But how his appearance had changed! Gone was the sleek, well-groomed
bird we knew; now, in his stead, we had a very disreputable little character,
minus tail except for a single broken feather. His behaviour was exactly
as though he had never been absent. His appetite was really amazing,
and as he was seen to be canying small caterpillars, the obvious conclusion
was that he had in fact been nesting and was now feeding young ones.
Despite careful observation we have failed to find the nest. Judging by
Fred's appearance it must have been built in a very cramped situation.
There can now be little doubt that Fred should really be referred to as
Freda, but I am pretty certain that we shall continue to call " it " Fred.

Last year Donald and Betty Risdon went on a fairly comprehensive
safari in East Africa; they have recently returned from a second. After
both, they said they were sure that members would have greatly enjoyed
such an experience. During February this year they spent five days on a
luxury, tented safari run by friends. They were delighted with this and
were able to spend a lot of time, either on foot or in the Land Rover,
taking photographs or just watching birds, elephants, giraffes, lions,
buffalos, various antelopes, hippos, etc., at very close range. Later,
Betty Risdon stayed on to join a rhino-catching trip with Carr Hartley and

his sons, west of the Serengeti. The Hartleys are mainly concerned
with the catching of animals that are becoming rare, for the Island of
Rubondo, in Lake Victoria. They were unlucky with rhino on this trip
as they had been poached in that area, but they did catch Roan and Topi.
It has occurred to the Risdons that some members of the Society might
like the opportunity of going on a safari during the winter months. They
feel that anyone who has not yet been to East Africa should take the chance
of seeing some of the birds and animals in the wild before it is too late--
already there are wide expanses that are bare of game. They are prepared
to arrange such a trip if sufficient support is forthcoming. Their experi-
ence has been that far more is to be seen at the leisurely pace of a tented
safari than rushing through the parks in a mini-bus to get to the lodges on
time. Carr Hartley is willing to take out a party when they are catching
animals, but he will not be available in November and December.
The Risdons have many transparencies of their trips which they would
be pleased to show to anyone at Rode. They have prepared a question-
naire, but the choice of type of safari, cost and time away would be up to
any members who might be interested. The suggested number for a
safari would be between 15 and 21. Members should get in touch with
the Risdons at the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, near Bath.

This is the second edition of a Dover publication which first appeared
in 1967. That was a revised republication of the work originally published
in 1958 by the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection
as Special Publication No. 13. It is reprinted by special arrangement
with that Committee.
The difficulty of preparing a list of this nature is exemplified in the
present edition, for six species which were thought to be extinct in 1958
have subsequently been found to be still in existence. On the other hand
in the same period one species and four subspecies have almost certainly
become extinct. The author has taken great care in bringing the informa-
tion up to date but obviously the position is constantly changing. The
Foreword by Jean Delacour, President-Emeritus of the International
Council for Bird Preservation stresses the threat to the existence of many
forms of wild life, and especially birds, resulting from the increase in

human population and the development of toxic substances for use in the
control of animal pests. There is also the gradual diminution in the area
of undeveloped parts of the earth's surface which often serve as refuges for
birds and other forms of life. Mr. Greenway has been faced with a
difficult task in preparing the list of vanishing birds but has restricted it to
those which are considered definitely and immediately threatened. The
author confines his list of extinct forms to those which have disappeared
within the past 280 years, comprising 42 species and 44 subspecies
known by their representative types in museums and with well documented
histories. There is also a list of birds known only from recent osseous
remains and finally a number of hypothetical forms known only by
pictures and the descriptions of travellers of long ago.
The fifth and longest list contains the names of small populations
which because of special circumstances connected with human inter-
ference are considered to be in danger of extinction. Finally there are
notes on some rare birds probably not in immediate danger.
There is an interesting chapter on the geography of extinction with
the rather surprising information that there is no account of extinction of
any species of birds on the continent of Europe with the exception of
Ostriches and the Great Auk. The area-by-area survey of important lost
and disappearing birds serves as a warning about the steps to be taken to
prevent the total disappearance of threatened species.
The main part of the book, however, is devoted to a discussion of each
species and subspecies, with detailed information on nomenclature, last
sightings, range, description, habits and similar material, including 86
text-figures of birds and a coloured cover illustration of two Cyanoramphus
parrots and the Dodo (Raphus cucullatus), by D. M. Reid Henry. There
is also a bibliography of 47 pages.
The book can be thoroughly recommended to all interested in
ornithology, and especially bird preservation. E. H.

'STIMULATE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxin(c), Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not hearsay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

373 pages, 63 pages of coloured photographs of parrots plus 26 pages in
colour on budgerigars. This book must be considered to be the finest
reference work available to the parrot fancier today. The book not only
identifies and provides you with all the necessary data about the many
birds and related species, but it also guides you through all the stages
of parrot care, feeding and breeding, from the selection of the cage down to
commercial breeding. There are hundreds of black and white and true
colour photographs of almost all known varieties from the budgerigar
to the unusual and exotic parrots of Africa, S. America, Australia, the
Philippines, India and the Pacific Islands.
The authors discuss the special characteristics of each species and
advise on special requirements if these are needed.
The authors are America's foremost authorities on parrots and they
have at their Palos Verdes Bird Farm for more than twenty years reared
these birds and have bred many birds which previously had never been

THE BRONZE-WINGED MANNIKIN
{Spermestes cucullatus)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.996444057142857" page_id="56364573"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Bronze-winged Mannikin, Spermestes cucullatus , is a small African
mannikin widely distributed over most of that continent south of the
Sahara. It occurs in large flocks and is imported as a cagebird in relatively
large numbers, its low price and relatively dull colouring making it of little
account to most aviculturists. The genus Spermestes has only four (or
three) species, the larger and big-billed Magpie Mannikin, Spermestes
fringilloides , the black-backed Black and White Mannikin, S. poensis and
the chestnut-backed Rufous-backed Mannikin, S. nigriceps y being the
other members of it. The last two, one in the central Congo Basin region
and the other in the east, are often regarded as two forms of a single species.
They are similar in size to the Bronze-winged Mannikin but prefer wood-
land or the vicinity of water rather than open grassland. All these species
are characterised by green or blue gloss on parts of the plumage but other-
wise seem to differ little from the typical mannikins ( Lonchura species)
with which they are often grouped by taxonomists, save that the Bronze-
winged Mannikin at least has a special posture during squabbles, raising
the wing that is furthest from the other bird high above its back like a
banner.
The Bronze-winged Mannikins are grassland birds, feeding on seed
taken from the grasses themselves or from the ground. They are highly
sociable, rarely seen alone, and usually occur in large flocks where grasses
or millet crops are ripe. In the wilds breeding is linked with the rainy
season and they may have several broods a year. This control of breeding
by the availability of water enables them to breed at almost any time of
year in captivity; and in the possession of this controlling factor they
resemble the Budgerigar and Zebra Finch which also show a prolonged
breeding season in aviaries. In spite of their strong sociable tendencies
these little mannikins are relatively aggressive, tending to squabble fre-
quently among themselves; and this may make them a nuisance if they are
kept with other birds such as smaller waxbills or less aggressive seed-eaters.
They nest readily, taking to a variety of sites. When not nesting they
build a communal roosting nest which as many as can will squeeze into at
nightfall. Desmond Morris, who made a detailed study of the behaviour
of this species ( Behaviour n (1957); 156-201), pointed out that unless a
pair were prepared to aggressively defend their nest and eject all comers

<bodyText confidence="0.999642666666667" page_id="56364574"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
they were liable to find that their nest had become a communal roost site by
dusk. Once a whole flock has paired up and started to nest the birds sleep
in their own nests. They may build very close to one another and at times
clustered nests have been recorded. They are not above utilising old
weaver bird nests in the wilds, a habit which they share with a number of
widely diverse African species, including starlings and lovebirds. They
also show the curious habit of nesting at times in close association with
wasps or hornets. This is usually cited as an example of recognition of
the protective value of the latter, but I sometimes wonder whether it might
not be that the wasps' nest, as a lump in a bush, suggests the beginnings of
a waxbill's nest and the likelihood that this is a potentially suitable site, and
so triggers off in the more sociable species the already present urge to build.
As in most of these species the young are unlike the adults, having a dull
brown plumage and a dark bill lacking the distinctive white of the lower
mandible of the adults. In the absence of such specific markings the
antagonism of the adults is not aroused and the young birds may move
about freely, usually sleeping at night in the parental nest. They mature
rapidly, and are ready to breed within a few months.

THE BREEDING OF RED LORIES AT PAIGNTON
ZOO
(Eos bornea)

Our pair of Red Lories was received by the Zoo in December 1966 and
immediately placed in a cage in the Parrot House. This particular cage
was remarkably small for breeding quarters, measuring only 58m. high by
37m. deep by 67m. wide, and it came as a surprise to everybody when
first of all two eggs were laid and later two fine chicks reared.
The nest-box provided was of normal design for smaller Parrakeets and
Lories measuring i6in. high by ioin. wide by 6in. deep with the entrance
hole, which was 4^in. square, in the top left hand corner. This was
placed in the cage in the April of 1967 at the highest possible point.
Little or no interest was shown in the nest-box at all until September,
when both of the birds began to disappear into the box for hours upon end,
but it was not until December, however, that it became apparent that there
was something present in it. Upon inspection it was found to contain two
eggs, which were difficult to see distinctly because of the position of the
box in relation to the roof of the cage. Because of the small size of the
cage, and the great risk of disturbing the birds, the eggs were not checked
at all to find out the date of hatching.

The first sign we had that the eggs had possibly hatched was when the
female was seen frequently coming out of the box to feed. This was at the
end of December 1967. By the end of the first week in January 1968 our
suspicions were confirmed when a shrill squeaking was heard coming from
the box while the female was feeding. By this time the male was also
I visiting the nest-box after having fed, presumably to feed the youngsters.

two chicks, because the nest-box had not been checked since the middle of

The young birds differed from their parents, being a much duller red,
having black beaks instead of mellow orange ones and black wing flashes
instead of blue. At the time of writing, which is seven months after
hatching, the young birds have still not developed the blue wing flashes, or
the bright scarlet plumage, but their beaks have toned to the same colour
as their parents. Also at this time the four birds are still kept together,
but preparations are now under way to remove the youngsters to an
adjacent cage.

(Certhia familiar is)
By F. Meaden (Cheshunt, Herts., England)
Three Treecreepers, Certhia familiar is, sexed on bill-length as a male
and two females, were given me by an old friend now deceased. They are
thought, originally, to have been rescued from a badly disturbed nest and
would now be in their fifth year. During the last winter they were kept in
a birdroom in a large cage which had the back and ends lined with natural
bark. The birdroom was warmed, the temperature ranging from 60 to
75* F. gradually being dropped to that which prevailed outdoors in March.
In April they were transferred to an outdoor flight 8ft. long x 4ft. wide
x 6ft. high. This adjoins the birdroom which shelters one side of it, the
roof overhanging the aviary by a distance of one foot. At the back of the
flight is a woven wattle fence, and the remainder of it is of wire. The
front has a feeding hatch about three feet from the ground, giving access to
a small shelf protected from the weather by a hood. Slabs of bark are
fixed against the inside of the flight along the birdroom side and at the end,
and along the top of the aviary about five inches below the birdroom over-
hang, a barked-covered shelf is fixed, projecting from the wall at an angle
of about 45 degrees.
The birds are fed on fresh daily supplies of Avi-vite, and finely chopped
green food; while twice daily grated cheese and maggots powdered with a
yeast preparation are provided. The latter we obtain while small and
fatten on a special diet. A multivitamin concentrate is given once weekly
on the maggots, and on this occasion the yeast is omitted. Greater Wax-
moth larvae are a favourite food and when available in quantity are given
freely. One daily item of which these birds seem to partake as freely as
anything else is " Farex " baby food mixed with milk.
In the flight, the birds selected individual roostsites in hollows in the
bark at widely separated points in the aviary. When not active they often
rested in the narrow space between the shelf and the roof, retiring there
also in bad weather. They shared the flight with one male and two female
Long-tailed Tits, Aegithalos caudatus , and a pair of Wrens, T. troglodytes ,
the three species being kept together because of their similar feeding
requirements. Nesting had not been anticipated in the aviary, but during
the latter part of April one of the females was seen carrying dry grass and
fine hair to a site behind the high shelf at the end nearer the back of the
flight. There was no definite evidence of nesting, but the birds had
various places where they could conceal themselves and tended to keep
still and become more difficult to locate when not active.
On 18th and 19th of May, a female was seen carrying a wax-moth larva
to and fro, but not swallowing it. Although a watch was kept the bird
made no effort to visit the site while under observation and there was no
sound of young birds. On 25th May, nestlings were heard for the first

time from a distance, but when anyone approached the aviary the birds
immediately became quiet, probably silenced by the parents, although no
warning had been heard. The secretiveness of the birds dashed any hopes
of discovering what role the second female played in all this. Certainly
the other two were not aggressive towards her. On 2nd June, from midday
onwards, an intermittent watch was kept to try to establish if the second
female was also feeding the young, but in fact the three adults rested in
different parts of the flight and showed very little activity. There seemed
no evidence of birds visiting the nest and nothing was heard of the young.
It was thought that they had died and so, at 8 p.m. the nest-site was
investigated.
To my surprise, several fully-feathered young scattered from it in all
directions, running like spiders along the bark, while the parents dashed
around calling loudly. The fouled nest contained three dried and
flattened young stuck to the nest-cup, and from the size of the feet I
estimated these to have died at 2-3 days old. The nest was lined with
grass (no moss being used although this was available), the outer coarse
structure being old dried fine strips of skin (bark) from honeysuckle
branches growing in their flight, wood shavings (some about 4m. x Jin. x
-^in.), feathers, and a little fine white dog-hair and cotton wool.
The three young that had emerged were quite tame when handled, but
when in the flight were made more alarmed by the nervous behaviour of
the parents.
At this period, the Wrens had also built a nest in a low nest-box and laid,
and the Long-tailed Tits were showing signs of activity. After about a
week, it would appear that fighting broke out as a hen Wren and the two
hen Tits were found dead, all within two days, severely pecked about the
head.
It is not certain what had happened and the birds were not seen to
disagree.
The Treecreepers had always been most amicable towards other birds,
but since this occurred when the young ones were moving a little uncertainly
about the flight, there is some reason to suspect that they might have been
involved.
It was felt to be necessary to catch up the other two odd male birds and
to remove them. While this was being done, the young Treecreepers were
also caught up and separated from the adults for several hours, during
which time attempts were made to hand-feed them, after the usual initial
forcing and upon becoming hungry, they gaped readily. They were,
however, restored to the parents who continued to care for them, but this
momentary association with human beings had a sequel when, after the
young had been out of the nest about a fortnight, the parents ceased to feed
them. The young were well able to feed themselves now, but still
preferred to beg, and when anyone approached the flight, the youngsters
would run about like small mice on the wire just in front of the visitor's face

pushing their bills through and squeaking to be fed. At this period it was
found that they were very reluctant to descend for food even though the i
parents did so, but would happily take it at a higher level, from a ledge or
when adhering to the wire. This is probably correlated with the fact that !
in the wild, young Treecreepers newly emerged from the nest are less
agile on the wing than the adults and tend to keep well up in the trees where
they are out of harm's way and less likely to be grounded in a flight from
one tree to another.
All three young have been reared to maturity, although one of them
recently discovered a tiny aperture in the structure of the flight door and
opted for total independence.
As described, F. Meaden has bred the Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris).
It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE CRIMSON-BACKED TANAGER
(Rhamphocelus dimidiatus)

opinion, one of the loveliest of all birds. It is a close relative of the Silver-
Beaked Tanager, (or Maroon Tanager as it is more generally known).
The coloration of the cock is a lovely dark crimson and black, and the hen
is similar but duller. The cock has a bright silver patch on his beak, and
the hen has a similar patch but much duller. These patches are not
visible in young birds.
Some years ago I imported a few of these birds from Colombia, and they
were in very beautiful condition when they arrived. I kept two for myself
which at the time I was pretty sure were a pair, but although they always
looked different I feel quite sure now were two cocks.
I kept these birds for some time, but they were rather spiteful and I got
rid of them. Last year Mr. L. R. Cousins of Manor Park told me that he
still had the pair that he had had from me. He was sure that they were a
true pair, but he could not get them to nest successfully, and would I like
to have another try? I agreed, and when the birds came down they were
very fit and were soon bosses of the large aviary into which they were put.
I suspect them of murder, but cannot be sure.
These birds are the swiftest thing that I have ever known, and they can
fly so fast that they appear to be a scarlet flash. They went to nest at once
and built a flimsy nest in gorse. The nest was built of dried strips of bark
pulled off perches. The eggs, two in number, were a very bright blue with

reddish brown markings. They hatched in 14 days, but the parents would
feed nothing other than mealworms, and after about a week the young
were thrown out and the whole business started all over again. I suspect
but cannot be sure that the young were alive when thrown out. I think
the cock did this.
I had five nests from these birds in 1967, but did not succeed in rearing a
single young one. This was a great disappointment apart from being a
financial disaster as the quantity of mealworms they consumed was
immense.
After thinking over the matter during the winter I decided that in 1968
I would try to breed them in a small individual aviary and so, when the
spring arrived, I put the birds in a summer aviary intending that, if the
birds bred I would separate the cock. The aviary was nice and secluded,
about 8ft. by 4ft. and about 7ft. high. The birds, however, like all my
birds, had different ideas, refused to build a nest, and laid their eggs off the
perches. So in desperation I put them back in their large flight--albeit
with some trepidation---and they went to nest at once, and in due course
one youngster flew. It was a nice strong little fellow, but he got caught in
one of the terrific rainstorms of the summer and disappeared.
By this time I was getting a bit tired of trying to breed these birds, but
they went to nest again, and again a young one flew. In spite of constant
danger from storms I managed to rear him and he is now quite self-suppor-
ting, although even after six weeks flying and with further young in the
nest the old birds will still sometimes feed him. Like all the other
Tanagers I have bred, there is no attempt to drive him away. The cock
bird is a lot quieter this year, and this seems to help a lot, but the parents
are so shy and active, that I have never seen the hen bird on the nest.
As I said before, these are most beautiful active, and self reliant birds
and the best way of breeding them would undoubtedly be the semi-freedom
principle, but here again it would not be easy to get them to nest in a small
aviary before giving them their liberty.
The only call I have ever heard them give is a very sparrow-like chirp.
They have a habit of stropping their beaks for a number of times before
feeding the young, but this is not done very regularly.
Careful observation of the behaviour of the young of the first brood to
the second brood shows that the younger birds are fed and looked after by
the birds from earlier broods even more carefully than by the parents.
The young are fed and preened, and any frightening of the young is
accompanied by protests from the earlier hatched birds.
In view of the intolerance of Tanagers for adult birds of the same race, it
is rather strange that they make no attempt to drive the young away, but I
make the following suggestion which may provide a possible answer.
Large Tanagers seem to have an extended breeding season, over here
usually from April until September, but these birds always have small
broods. The size of the average clutch is two eggs, and only occasionally
are three eggs found in a clutch.

S. B. KENDALL--AVIARY HYGIENE
As brood follows brood rapidly, and as the young are fed for a month to
six weeks after flying, this feeding behaviour of the older birds would
greatly assist the parents.
When the breeding season is over the young birds remain with their
parents for the winter, and indeed in their native haunts may easily flock
like finches do here. In the spring fighting starts for mates and territory,
and the birds usually have to be separated by February or March.
As described, Herbert Murray has bred the Crimson-backed Tanager
(Rhamphocelus dimidiatus). It is believed this may be a first success.

By S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England)
Our Secretary has asked me to supply a note on the after-treatment of
aviaries that have contained birds suffering from infectious or contagious
disease. An initial brief word on avoiding infection and limiting its spread
seems appropriate.
New birds are of course the danger and the more you buy the more risk
you run. The golden rule is to quarantine every new arrival, regardless of
its origin, and it is best for each to be confined in a separate cage. I use all-
wire cages made quite simply and cheaply of welded mesh, supported on
angle iron over a concrete floor covered with newspaper which can be
folded up each day and burnt. Feed and water the new arrivals after the
rest of your stock and don't interchange equipment. With established
stock remember that young birds are much more susceptible to disease
than are adults and that the best way of limiting trouble from disease is to
keep the family unit together as a group: the best way of promoting an
epidemic is to aggregate successive groups of young birds throughout the
season.
Measures to avoid infection, limit disease and to make premises safe after
disease will obviously vary greatly according to the circumstances and the
disease organisms that have caused the trouble. For example, a virus, as
recent experience with foot and mouth disease has shown, may readily be
transmitted from one set of premises to another, even by the wind. But
on the other hand most viruses under normal conditions are delicate organ-
isms which are readily destroyed by ordinary environmental conditions--
particularly direct sunshine. Infected animals may be excreting enormous
amounts of virus and this can be disseminated far and wide, but once the
source of infection (the live animal) has been removed the danger rapidly
decreases.

S. B. KENDALL---AVIARY HYGIENE
205:
By contrast, some organisms spread only with difficulty, but may remain
alive for a very long time. Some may have complicated life-histories with
a dependence on a vector--an insect for example--which may need to be
of a particular species. If this is confined to the particular tropical
country from which the bird derives there is no danger at all of spread
from the individual or group of individuals involved in an outbreak of
disease soon after importation. Many parasites have specially resistant
stages of development. Thus the coccidia have resistant spores which
under average conditions will survive for weeks and which under ideal
conditions may survive very much longer. Sometimes the parasite adopts
more sophisticated means of ensuring survival. Thus Histomonas (the
" Blackhead " organism) which is extremely delicate, survives in the egg of
the caecal worm and this in turn (like the Gape-worm) can live and be
carried around by earth-worms.
Clearly the measures to be taken to control an outbreak of virus disease
in a pheasantry will be very different from those necessary to control
blackhead.
Some broad principles of disease control may nevertheless be suggested.
Aviaries with earth floors are really impossible to free from infective
agents except by destocking, the length of time for which they should
remain vacant varying greatly with the infective agent. Under experi-
mental conditions organisms with resistant stages can survive for a year or
more but there is usually a steep decline in viability after the first three
weeks or so particularly under dry conditions. Obviously a practical
compromise has to be accepted. A month's rest will do a great deal of
good and three months will make it essentially as safe as it ever was.
Most modern epidemiologists regard absolute freedom from infection as
unrealistic. With most diseases the object is to limit the amount of
infection rather than totally avoid it. In practice a system whereby birds
are wintered on concrete or other readily cleaned floors and summered on
grass has a lot to recommend it.
If serious disease has occurred in a grass flight the use of a flame-gun to
remove surface vegetation and general debris (Mind the wire!) gives the
soil a chance to dry out and dryness is death to most disease organisms.
Even the hottest flame has, however, a very superficial effect for soil has
excellent insulating properties. Flaming merely accelerates a natural
process. After the top soil has dried, turning it over and liming also
accelerate the natural processes which make it safe. Making an aviary
shelter or aviary with a solid floor safe for further stocking is much easier.
Remove all dirt and debris first and then use plenty of water and detergent.
Allow to dry out completely (a week or more) before restocking.
It will be noticed that so far I have said nothing about disinfectants.
Under some circumstances chemical substances may have a special use--
viruses are often very susceptible to changes in pH so washing soda in the
water is effective, hypochlorite (bleach) is a good general disinfectant and

ammonia solution has a specific effect against the spores of coccidia, but all
these substances are effective only when they can get in contact with the
organism, i.e. when surfaces are already clean. They may add to the effect
produced by ordinary cleaning but it is no more than this. Slopping
disinfectant about as a substitute for cleaning is strongly to be dis-
couraged. Use of disinfectants on earth floors is usually a waste of time.
Special considerations apply to ornithosis (psittacosis)--a subject which
tends to evoke an emotional response from parrot keepers. While serious
disease is comparatively rare it must be accepted that the organism can be
dangerous to man and it behoves us all to treat it with respect.
If ornithosis has been confirmed the implication is that professional
advice is available. It should be taken.
As regards the infected aviary, it is important to realize that there is
likely to be a heavy contamination with the infective organism, but that in
the absence of birds it will not last very long. Shut the doors and windows
of the aviary shelter and leave the aviary alone for a week or ten days. It
is possible to hasten the destruction of the organism by formalin fumigation
but time will produce the same result. After at least a week open every-
thing up, first spray some water about to settle the dust and then clean out,
avoiding personal contamination, including inhalation, as far as possible.
If a bird has died in a cage, put the cage in the garden on the compost heap,
hose it down and leave it outside to weather for a week before a proper
clean and polish.
With nearly all disease, dilution of the infective agent is the important
thing and this is accomplished by plenty of water and fresh air.
A final word about a gloomy subject--if birds did not have a considerable
natural resistance to their specific pathogens there would be very few left
alive. We can enormously help those that are in our care by sensible
stock management--good food, as much space as possible and protection
from unreasonable climatic stress.

The Sun-Bittern is a member of the order Gruiformes which contains
eleven varied living families, seven of which contain three species or less
and two families which are known to science only as fossils. Although the
members of the Order look unrelated externally (it includes such diversified
birds as cranes, hemipodes (quail-like birds), Limpkin (Ibis-like) and
Kagu (stork-like) but, on examination of internal structure, one finds
skeletal and muscular affinities. Their closest relatives outside the Order
appear to be the Galliformes (fowl-like birds) and Charadriiformes (shore-
birds, gulls and auks) and are thus classified between these two orders.

We have three specimens of this bird in the large aviary in the centre of
the Bird House at London Zoo at the present, as this aviary contains two
large ponds--a necessary thing as in the wild Sun-Bitterns like to walk
slowly in shallow water and feed like herons by staring into the water and
suddenly thrusting the bill into it. Although the water in the aviary
contains no food (apart from the strips of meat the birds themselves take
from the food tin and dunk before consuming it), they appear to enjoy
wading. When displaying, the wings and tail are opened, the rear edges
of wings being raised thus revealing the full pattern and colour to the mate.
This attitude is also adopted when threatening other birds and is accom-
panied by a harsh rattling cry. The birds spend much time walking
sedately around the aviary, uttering a long-drawn whistle (which may be
very soft) which is sometimes followed by a rattle, though less harsh than
that used in aggression. They will also spend some time standing
motionless with head resting between shoulders, like a Heron. This bird
adopts a strange, erratic attitude in which it will run up and
down quickly while flicking wings and turning round and round, and I
have seen this take place for no apparent reason. I have often seen it
standing with just body swaying from side to side--probably for the same
reason that bitterns extend their necks and sway to render them less
conspicuous among the swaying reeds (although in the case of Sun-
Bitterns the neck is not always extended and the body is never held
vertically as bitterns do). In the wild they thrive on minnows, insects, etc.,
but in the Zoo we give them minced meat together with an insect mixture
and also maggots, mealworms, house flies and locusts.

PETER J. LEVI-NOTES ON THE SUN-BITTERN
</sectionHeader>

The nest is situated in a tree or bush (though there are records of them
also nesting on the ground) and is a globular structure made of decaying
leaves, stems and green leaves in which two oval eggs are laid, these being
clay-coloured or buffish with darker spots and blotches.
During the year 1865 there was a long continuance of hot and dry
weather during the Summer and Autumn, and Mr. A. D. Bartlett, who was
the Superintendent of the&apos;Zoological Society's gardens at that time, wrote
in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1866 that he felt this had
much to do with the influence on breeding and the tendency to breed of
animals that had not previously done so.
Bartlett noted that the pair of Sun-Bitterns that were purchased in
September 1862 had begun to show signs of breeding early in May, e.g.
carrying about bits of sticks, roots of grass, etc. and were consistently
walking round the pond searching for nesting materials; they also tried to
mix wet dirt with moss, etc., so they were supplied with wet clay and mud.
After a short time they settled to make a nest on the top of a tree 10 ft.
from the ground, on which was fixed an old straw nest. Both birds carried
up mud and clay mixed with straw, roots, etc. and the sides of the nest
were raised and plastered inside with mud. One morning a few fragments
of a broken egg were found below the tree which may have been from this
bird but as there was a Blue Waterhen in the same aviary it was probable
that it could have been from this species; so this bird was removed from the
aviary. In the early part of June the female had laid an egg in the nest
which resembled that of a Moorhen or Woodcock. Both birds incubated
the egg and the young bird took 27 days to hatch. It was a very attractive
chick being thickly covered with fine short tufts of down and bore resem-
blance to a young plover or snipe though the head and body was covered
with somewhat longer hair than is to be found in the aforementioned
species. The chick remained in the nest, being fed regularly by both
parents on small live fish as well as a few insects, etc. It had a rather
peculiar method of taking its food, for instead of gaping or calling like
most nestlings it would snap or peck the morsel from the parent's bill as
soon as it alighted upon the nest and swallowed it at once. At 21 days the
wings were sufficiently developed to enable it to fly to the ground, where it
was fed as before and never again returned to the nest. It grew very
quickly and within two months was indistinguishable from its parents.
Early in August the parents began repairing the nest, adding a fresh lining
of mud and clay, and at the end of August another egg was laid. This
time the male appeared to do the incubation with much greater care than
the female, who continued to feed the now nearly full-grown young one;
the second youngster hatched on the 28th September. Both parents were
seen feeding the first more frequently than the second youngster so the
second young one was hand-reared by the Keeper though it was left in the
nest and they both reached maturity.

The eggs of this species differ remarkably from those of the true herons, in-
asmuch that they are spotted and blotched whereas heron's eggs are unmarked
except for damp stains caused by the vegetation; thus they resemble more
closely those of plovers and snipes, but the young differ in the fact that they
remain in the nest whereas in the plovers and snipes they run about as soon
as they are hatched, or a few hours afterwards.
It has also been bred in Bronx Park, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro.
It is an inhabitant of central and northern South America and there are
three races.

FREE FLYING QUAKER PARRAKEETS
AT PAIGNTON ZOO
(Myiopsitta m. monachus)

The founders of the present colony were purchased in 1957. The
exact number is not known to the writer, but probably consisted of three
pairs. They have always been housed in the same aviary and regularly
nested and produced young. Quite a number of birds have been sold and
a few have died, but by the Summer of 1967 the flock numbered approxi-
mately 40 birds with an unknown number of eggs and young in the nest.
After much consultation it was decided to try the experiment of releasing
the birds to form a free flying flock of homing parakeets. The one diffi-
culty which had been pointed out by various Zoo Directors was that free
flying Quaker Parrakeets had done great damage to fruit orchards in the
vicinity of the home nest. However, as Paignton Zoo is itself heavily
wooded and surrounded by forest areas we felt that any damage would be
local and so spread out among the thousands of trees and shrubs in
Paignton Zoo, Clennon Gorge, Primley Woods, etc. as to be hardly
noticed, and so in early August when many young birds were in the nest a
panel of wire mesh was removed from the top of their Aviary and the birds
allowed to escape at their leisure.
The Quakers took quite some time before they realised that the way was
open to the outside world and spent about an hour inspecting the hole and
peering in all directions before the first bird plucked up enough courage to
fly out. Other birds soon followed its example and by late afternoon
nearly all the adults had left the aviary for short flights, returning every
few minutes. From then on the birds began to fly farther and farther
afield, until now they are often seen up to two miles away.

210 MRS. P. SHEPHERD--NOTES ON BREEDING THE QUAKER PARRAKEET
The Quakers always fly in small flocks of six or eight birds together, and
it would seem that, because of this, native British birds are discouraged
from mobbing them, for not once has an incident of this sort been reported.
Before the birds were released a yearly event was the destruction in the
the Spring of the old nest before a new one was started. This, despite the
fact that plenty of fresh twigs were placed in the Aviary. This year, with
the birds able to choose just the material that they require, the pattern of
behaviour has changed, and work on enlarging the old nest and the
building of new ones has gone on without pause. There are now three
large nests in the Aviary and one outside in an overhanging tree. The
three nests inside the Aviary now all contain eggs and young birds.
One interesting feature of this Aviary is the way in which it has been
used by British wild birds, Goldfinches, Greenfinches, Blackbirds, Bull-
finches, finding it a convenient source of food, and a pair of Blue-tits have
just raised two young, presumably in one of the Parakeets' nest holes.
We cannot be sure if we have suffered any losses, but as twenty to thirty
birds are often seen at one time in and around the Aviary, it would seem as
if losses, if any, have been very small.
From our point of view the experiment has been a great success and the
visitors enjoyment has been much enhanced by seeing these industrious
little birds hard at work bringing in their twigs from all parts of the Zoo.

SOME NOTES ON BREEDING THE QUAKER
PARRAKEET
(Myiopsitta monarchus)

By Mrs. P. Shepherd (Dunkeswell, Devon, England)
In 1967 we brought two pairs of Quaker Parrakeets, Myiopsitta
monarchus , housing them in a large aviary partly roofed with translucent
corrugated plastic, and with a small roosting shelter. The birds never used
the latter but one pair used the entrance hole as a base for a nest. The
nest was cup-shaped and gradually built upwards and outwards to meet the
roof, after which twigs were woven into the roof netting and around the
sides to form a tunnel with an entrance that extended downwards slightly
to give a final length of about three feet. About halfway through building
we considered it advisable to support the structure with a piece of weld-
mesh underneath it. The second pair started a smaller nest alongside.
We live up in the Blackdown Hills where the winters can be quite severe,
but the birds stayed out all last winter, roosting in their nests, through
severe frost and snow (up to 12 inches), staying active and cheerful and
playing about happily in the snow. They were fed on 50/50 budgie seed
mixture and some sunflower seed. They were always provided with
large bundles of fresh cut birch and willow branches which they enjoy

eating, consuming both leaves and bark reducing them to nothing within
a matter of hours.
In May we unfortunately lost one hen, and in late May the other was not
to be seen and we hoped for the best. Both pairs had been seen mating
and we knew that it was a hen that had been lost. The other sat for about
three weeks. After about two and a half weeks we began supplying green-
food and apple ad. lib., (they ate perpetual spinach, lettuce, young dande-
lion, masses of chickweed, and at least one whole sweet apple per day).
We did not disturb them and the nest could only be inspected with the aid
of a small mirror on a stick by which means we thought we could see three
chicks, but were delighted about three weeks later to see seven green and
grey heads up the tunnel when the parents were out. The young left the
nest after about a further ten days. They would all play together, pulling
tails and chasing one another. The lone cock was a little aggressive
towards them but they were protected by the parents and learned to avoid
him and his nest. We have long-suffering neighbours, but in view of the
noisiness of the birds we decided to dispose of all but one of the young
which we hope will be a hen.

By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Chester, England)
Numerically results were well below average, exceptionally heavy rain
causing some losses of newly-hatched young, while vandalism by boys
caused loss of liberty Budgerigars, and of eggs from aviaries, with some
mixing of birds. 31,000 sq. feet of aviary was in use with about 1,000
resting, breeding pairs having, on average, 200 sq. ft. per pair. Two
Emperor Geese were reared but fertile Chiloe Wigeon and Mandarin eggs
were stolen. Blue-eared, Elliott's, Swinhoe's, and Amherst Pheasants,
Red-legged Partridge and some Quail all produced young.
A Monal x Amherst hybrid was reared, the cock Monal gained access
to an Amherst trio when a door was blown open and the hybrid remained
un-noticed until the poults were a few weeks old. It was reared on turkey
crumbs. The hybrid is an interesting bird. It has the Monal sway when
running and also its father's digging action. The tail is short and fanned
out in Monal fashion. It also has the Monal characteristic of standing in
an upright position ready to strike, and has the natural curiosity and fear-
less disposition of the breed. The bill is heavy and curved. There is a
circle of light green around the eye and the spangling is darker and finer
than on the Amhersts hatched with it. There is no sign of a crest but
spur-points are visible about halfway up the yellowish legs. It cheeps
like a young Amherst.
Zebra Doves made several nests and reared two young in different nests.
White Barbary Doves reared two young. Yellow-billed Peru Doves, the
hen of which was one of two reared in 1967, had two nests but continually

left when anyone approached within 50 feet. Since hundreds of visitors!
passed through a nearby aviary there was no chance of success and the
eggs were put under Barbary Doves but were crushed.
Cinnamon and lutino Greenfinches, Chaffinches, Bullfinches, and
Goldfinches bred, the last two from northern British x stock. Bramblings
had two nests, the young of the first being lost through parental neglect and
the second brood reared by fostering on Greenfinches.
Blue Tits were bred by controlled liberty methods, the parents being
allowed to find their own food. The large aviaries supplied adequate live
food for some species; no special provision being made for Hedge-
Sparrows which also bred, their aviary having an 80,000 cu. ft. capacity
and including 18 30 -year-old fruit trees pruned back to 12ft. high and
a mass of plum suckers that attract live food of various kinds. The
Hedge Sparrows take plate millet all the year round. Song Thrushes
reared a first round without extra live food, but it was offered when the
second round hatched since Starlings were feeding young in the same aviary.
A single 1967 Song Thrush built and laid two clutches, two eggs being
replaced by fertile ones and the young reared for ten days before being
thrown out of the nest. A pair of Blackbirds reared their first brood in an
aviary and after it was opened returned to raise another round in the open 1
unit.
A pair of Melba Finches, housed alone in a 50 ft. x 7 ft. aviary with
12 ft. shelter hatched young which disappeared at two days, and Pekin
Robins in a 40 ft. x 50 ft. aviary never progressed beyond carrying
material. Purple-headed Glossy Starlings, Cordon Bleus, Fire Finches,
Zebra Finches, and Indian Silverbills bred at liberty, the unique method
of liberation having a bearing on success. The established flock of
liberty Zebras more than doubled and there was an increase in the Silver-
bills. Of three pairs each of Cordon Bleus and Fire Finches a pair of each
brought home four and three young respectively, while a nest of young
Fire Finches was washed out in a storm. Three adult Cordon Bleus and
four Fire Finches went missing after a few weeks, as did one of two
Lavender Finches also liberated. The liberty system contributed to the
successful rearing of three Purple-headed Glossy Starlings. At three
months old the young have dark eyes and the plumage, unlike that of the
young of our native species, is glossy.
Two White-crested Jay-thrushes, at liberty all winter, but roosting in
their aviary, moved to the garden of a friend half a mile away where they
have spent the summer without returning, being fed there twice a day.
Approximately 150 birds are at controlled liberty, about half being
Budgerigars which have nested in the open garden for several years.
Observation on the reproduction of various British bird species under
various conditions and diets has added further data to that accumulated
over past years, with ample evidence that feeding is the critical factor in
the successful reproduction of most species.

(Bubo africanus )
By Owen D. Long (Salisbury, Rhodesia)
The first pair of these birds which came my way were found wandering
on the Salisbury Kopje in November, 1961 by two young Indian boys who
gave them to D. M. Reid-Henry, who in turn gave them to me. I would
have guessed their age to have been about four to five weeks. At this stage
they were fed mainly on rats and mice, of which there was an adequate
supply, but partly on ox heart and shin.
In the following August, I noticed that the female had suddenly gone
broody, and not wishing to upset her I left her alone until I decided that
something should have happened, and when I put my hand under her I
found that she had been incubating a stone.
The following year, the original male made good his escape, and was
replaced by another, and in August the first two eggs were laid. These
proved to be fertile, but due to some disturbance (I think), as the eggs
chipped, so they were eaten. The same thing happened again in 1964 and
1965, and in these three years the female laid a total of thirteen eggs, all of
which were fertile.
Up to this time my neighbour had kept about 200 hens, and in con-
sequence had maintained a large rat population, so much so that I was able
to buy rats from the African who tended his chickens at a penny per animal,
and there was never a real shortage of food. However, in 1965 my
neighbour decided to give up his chickens, and although I had a bumper
crop of rats when the buildings were demolished they were the last I was to
see from this source. In consequence, for the last two years this pair of
Owls had has nothing but ox heart, with the exception of one rat, one
mouse, one dead kitten (killed by dogs) and a three week old guinea fowl
chick which found its way into their aviary.
The first egg was laid in 1966 on 30th July, and a further six followed,
all suffering the fate of previous clutches. The eighth egg this year had to
be removed surgically, due to lack of shell. What shell there was, was paper
thin and offered no resistance to the muscular efforts to eject it, and the
aid of the veterinary surgeon had to be sought.
It is normally agreed that in order to keep any bird in good condition it
must have food comparable with that which it finds in the wild, and with
birds of prey this is even more so in view of the apparent necessity to take
casting. It is said in some books on the subject that without this casting
the birds will deteriorate in condition, and presumably, eventually die,
and whilst I would not advocate that fur and feather are a thing of the past,
it is evident that in some cases at least, birds of prey can survive without it.
It seems that it is the fatty content of ordinary meat which does the damage,
and I therefore remove every possible trace of fat from the ox heart before
feeding it to the birds,

OWEN D. LONG-EXPERIENCES WITH SPOTTED EAGLE OWLS
It was therefore, with some satisfaction that on the ist August, this year
(1967), I was able to note that the first Owl egg was laid. Having nothing
better to offer, and remembering the last egg of 1966, I decided to sprinkle
all meat with shell grit, and although this was not much appreciated, it was
finally eaten, and on the 4th August, the second egg was laid. I have not
been able to find a reliable incubation period for this race, but I estimated
from the available date on Owls that it would be about 30 days. On 4th
September whilst putting food into the aviary I was delighted therefore to
witness the female feeding a chick which I would estimate to be 2 days old.
Whether this was the first or second egg, I am not quite sure, but I suspect
it was the second, because of the state of development of the chick, and
because upon inspection the shell of the egg which did not hatch was about
half the thickness that it should have been, and though it was fertile it
failed to hatch due to minute hair cracks which became visible upon
cleaning. Unfortunately no remains of the shell of the egg which did
hatch were found, but with the added shell grit, I am sure it must have
been thicker. This would therefore give an incubation period of 29 days
minimum and 31 days maximum. Ten days after the chick was first seen
it had increased in size to about three times its original. Sixteen days after
being first seen (21 Sept.), the chick was growing well, and in poor light
conditions it was noticed that some colour was becoming evident in the
region of its wings, but elsewhere the down was still sandy grey. It was
able to shuffle around the nesting cavity, but was not seen to stand other
than on its tarsi.
A week later it was standing up well and had a sharp look about it which
augured well for the future, however, on the following day it had dis-
appeared, and no trace of it has since been seen.
During the whole of its four week life it had nothing to eat other than ox
heart, doctored with Veterex and sprinkled with powdered bone meal.
Where it went to remains a mystery, though I have my own ideas on the
subject. On the tenth of October, the hen laid another egg, followed by a
partner two days later. These she incubated for ten days, and then for
some completely unknown reason, deserted. Both eggs were fertile.
Note: --In 1968 the pattern has been repeated. The first clutch con-
tained three eggs, two of which disappeared after a fortnight, and the
remaining one hatched. This chick survived for five days, and was then,
presumably, eaten. The second clutch had only one egg, which was in-
cubated for a period of ten days, and was then deserted.
It would seem, therefore, from what has happened to date, that on a
diet of oxheart, some Owls are quite capable of laying fertile eggs. How
much of this fertility is due to the Veterex remains a problem for further
investigation, as does the problem of why some eggs are eaten and others
not. Similarly I have been unable to ascertain whether the chick dies
and is then eaten or whether the parents kill it, but from observations
I have been able to make, the latter seems more probable.

I young birds, of which one subadult male soon died. The others showed
up to be 1 male, 3 females, in 1963 1 male and 1 female died, and then I
had to find some males. 1964 I succeeded in getting one, and in 1965
three males. Unfortunately the 1964-male died in December 1965. In
1966 one female had two, the other three clutches of two or three eggs;
only one was fertile and it did not hatch.
In autumn 1966 female number 1 in moult got a red throat-patch, not as
great as in the male and somewhat darker.
In 1967 there was only one infertile egg, and in the autumn female 2 got
\0x25A0 some red feathers on the throat. In January 1968 female 1 and a male died.
I found them hanging dead in the twigs; they presumably died in their
sleep.
On 10th of January I discovered three eggs in a birhen nestbox, you
can buy them for tits and other garden-birds. Interior measurements:
height 22cm. diameter 10cm. and diameter of the entrance 6cm. On
January 21st there was at least one chick; the female was in the box under
the inspection and the young seemingly three or four days old. Some days,
later I happened to see the female out of nest and on inspecting I found
three young with a little dark down, light flesh-coloured skin, and
pale bills and legs. The chicks thrived, although I never saw the parents
feeding them, but my experience with Loriculus vernalis, Vernal Hanging
Parrakeet, is that the female alone feeds the young, and she herself is fed
by the male, with a white pastelike mass. It seems to be normal, as the
female always becomes bare round the bill and somewhat dingy, when the
male is clean and full-feathered.
The young thrived, and I inspected the nest daily. As others besides
myself have found, the nest is very soiled, so you have to change the
nesting material. Three times during the last part of the nesting period I
had to change the sawdust.
In the morning of the 20th of February I found the female dead in the
water-basin, she apparently had fallen dead from the twigs as only one side
was wet. One of the young ones sat in a corner of the flight, and it was
returned to the nest. Now I several times this day inspected the chicks
to see, if the male would feed them, and fortunately he did. The following
two days one young was out of nest and was returned to it, as I was afraid
the male would forget the two others in the nest if the young was allowed
to be out of nest.
The 24th two young were out of nest, the third was dead in the box.
The young are light green with red rumps, pale flesh-coloured legs and
pale horn-coloured bill. The front-feathers shining pale green.

BREEDING OF THE KOOKABURRA AT

By William H. Timmis (Curator of Birds and Mammals)
The Kookaburra ( Dacelo novaeguineae) is an inhabitant of the sclerophyll

and savannah woodlands of the eastern section of Australia from west of |
Adelaide to Cape York. Whilst it extends through the drier country in !
the south where the range overlaps that of the Blue Winged Kookaburra
(D. leachii ), it is essentially an inhabitant of the coastal mountains.
In Cape York, D. novaeguineae is dominant in the hilly country of the
central range of the Peninsula, whilst D. leachii is the common species
elsewhere (drier areas). It has been suggested that the susceptibility of
D. novaeguineae to heat and drought possibly places it at a competitive
disadvantage with D. leachii in the north of the continent.
Dacelo novaeguineae was introduced to south-western Australia in 1896
and to Tasmania in 1905 in both of which the species is now well estab-
lished.
Chester Zoo received a Kookaburra in i960 and two more in 1965.
The first specimen proved to be a male and although the two received in
1965 were sent to us as a pair, they proved to be two females. On 23 rd
May, 1968, one egg was laid under three logs positioned in a small aviary in
our Temperate Bird House, a second egg was laid on 25th May and a third
on 27th May. Both male and female incubated the eggs for a period of 28
days (the birds did not commence to incubate until the last egg had been
laid.) Only two eggs hatched and I assumed that the third was infertile
but three days after the first two hatchings, a third chick was observed in
the nest although the egg was just a little distance from the nest. How-
ever, after four days the third chick disappeared, possibly having been
mistaken for a mouse or food.
The young were blind for 15 days and the first chick left the nest at 30
days, the second at 32 days. Both adults took part in brooding and
feeding the young and I was able to keep a record of the feeding schedule.
The birds were fed twice a day at 8.00 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. From one to
four days--four small fresh-killed mice cut into small pieces, 15 medium
sized locusts, 12 mealworms and four ounces of chopped uncooked
horsemeat. From four to 12 days --10 fresh killed mice and small rats,

By Thomas R. M. Brosset (Gothenburg, Sweden)
Mr. Tage Larsson, Resterog, has given me the following few details of
the breeding of the Jendayax Nanday Conure. The male Jendaya and
the female Nanday Conure were both acquired at the same time, probably
during early spring, 1962. They went to nest the same year and reared
some young (four, Mr. Larsson thinks) in a single nest: followed by
another two broods of four and three young ones in 1963. For some
reason their nest-box was taken away in 1964 and later the pair and some
of the hybrids were sold to Norrkoping C.B.S., which runs a Bird House
in a park in the city, where the birds can still be seen. No further
breeding attempt has been made. I quote and translate Mr. Larsson's
own words: " They were the easiest birds to breed and I could have had
as many young as I wanted " ( Burspraket , vol. 8, no. 2, p. 29, 1966).
Here are some of the more noteworthy breeding results in Sweden
during 1967 (F = has been considered as a "first" breeding in Sweden):

Mr. Magnusson also had five chicks in a nest of a young pair of Princess
of Wales's Parrakeets, but unfortunately they were all killed by the
parents when about ten days old. Of course he hopes to breed them
successfully in 1968, as well as he hopes that his pairs of Blue-winged
Grass and Barraband's (new young male introduced to the old female)
Parrakeets will go to nest and rear young ones, too. None of these
species are known to have been bred in Sweden before.
Mr. Forsberg's wife partly hand-reared a young Scaly-breasted Lorikeet,
because it was plucked by its parents. This year, she has also hand-
reared a young Swainson's Blue Mountain Lorikeet, and, when writing
this, a new half-grown Scaly-breasted Lorikeet is being reared by its
parents. To prevent it from being plucked, it has been placed in a small
cage, and is now fed quite well through the wire-netting. If reared to
maturity by the parents, the breeding will no doubt be regarded as a
"first".
Mr. Forsberg's collection of parrot-like birds is very interesting and
varied, and for the moment he keeps pairs of the following species, many
of which have been bred: Red-rump and Splendid Parrakeet, Eastern
Rosella, Swainson's, Forsten's, Scaly-breasted, Perfect, Ornate, and
Chattering Lory, Festive Amazon Parrot, Jendaya Conure, White-winged
Parrakeet, Moustache and Plum-headed Parrakeet, Cockatiel, Abyssinian
and Peach-faced Lovebird. Also, he keeps a pet green-winged Macaw.
I paid a visit to Mr. Jan Hogberg, Sorunda, last Christmas. The
female of his pair of Blue and Gold Macaw has died, but he has imported
some new Lories, Cockatoos, Hanging Parrots, and a pair of Everett's
Blue-backed Parrots (if I am right). Two young Swainson's Lorikeets
were just about to leave the nest, and a pair of Senegal Parrots (not my old
pair, but the other breeding pair he bought some years ago) had three or
four youngsters in the nest-box.
Mr. Einar Winroth, Vaxjo, phoned me the other day and said, he had
to tell me that he had six one week old chicks Abyssinian Lovebird in one
nest. I never heard of more than four young per nest of that species.

MESIA x PEKIN ROBIN HYBRIDIZATION
By L. Hervouet (Ville d'Avray, France)
In the spring of 1966 I put one Mesia cock and two Pekin Robin hens in
:a large planted aviary. In April I remarked that one of the hens was
paired with the Mesia cock: the two birds were almost inseparable, flying
about together, perching together and being very attentive to each other
which, in Leothrix language, signifies love . . .
During May and June the hen brought some coconut fibres and seemed
to want to nest, but the preparations went no further.
In 1967 as soon as the month of March came round, I replaced the three
birds in the aviary, firmly hoping for a rapid result. In the same aviary
there was a pair of Shamas. These birds started to nest in the early part of
April, but the trio, on the other hand, did not start nesting, although they
seemed to have excellent intentions (namely fetching fibres etc.).
At the beginning of July I removed the surplus hen and a few days later
a nest was built in a genista bush of about 4ft. high by the hen paired with
the Mesia. Three eggs were soon laid and sat upon and kept warm alterna-
tively by the cock and the hen. The birds were very tame and I was able
to take several photographs of them, without their leaving the nest. After
a period of thirteen days, two young birds were hatched (the third egg was
fertilised but did not hatch) and were perfectly well reared by the two
parents on ant eggs, mealworms and maggots. No other food was
accepted. In twelve days the two young ones had feathers and left the
nest; but they could not fly and, had the weather not been fine and warm,
I am afraid they would not have survived. The plumage of the young
hybrids was slate-grey with white down on the stomach; one had the same
pale orange-red beak as the hen, while the other had a more yellow one
(like the Mesia, but much paler). I am curious to know what the definite
colours will be. It is certainly a case of hybridization made very interesting
through the behaviour of the parents. I have seldom seen such a brave
and devoted pair of birds: they did not hesitate to attack the Shamas if they
approached the younger ones and, when the latter left the nest and I
approached to try (in vain) to put them back into the nest, the indignation
of the parents was concentrated on me: they flew around my head, alighting
very near my hands, making a great noise and having a menacing manner--
this attitude changed immediately when I retired and threw them some
mealworms.
The eggs much resemble those of the Canary, except that they are
perhaps a little larger. The nest is made of coconut fibres, in the form of a
cup and hangs from branches in bushes.

By Joseph Bell, Associate Curator of Birds (New York, U.S.A.)
The bird breeding program at the Bronx Zoo during 1968 has been
extremely interesting, varied in the experience offered to the bird-keeping
staff and rewarding in the numbers of good specimens reared and added to
the collection. In all, 209 birds of 40 species were reared. Worthy of
special note in this group were, 22 Greater Rheas Rhea americana , and 18
Darwin's Rhea Pterocnemia pennata, the first birds of this order to be
reared here. Also breeding and producing young here for the first time
were Australian Radjah Shelduck Tadorna radjah rufitergum, Hawaiian
Duck Anas platyrhynchos wyvilliana, Argentine Ruddy Duck Oxyura
vittata , American Ruddy Duck Oxyura jamaicensis, and Ruff or Fighting
Snipe Philomachus pugnax. A pair of Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber, nested
again this year in the RIVERBANK display of the AQUATIC BIRDS
building and raised two chicks. In the TREETOPS exhibit of the same
building a colony of Boat-billed Herons Cochlearius cochlearius, has con-
tinued to thrive. Nine young boat-bills have left the nests so far this year
and six chicks and a number of eggs are being brooded at this writing.
Fourteen boat-bills were reared in this display during 1967.
Two White-faced Glossy Ibis Plegadis chihi , chicks that were hatched in
a nest in an outside enclosure during the summer, did not survive a heavy
rainstorm on the evening following hatching. The greatest disappoint-
ment of the breeding season was an egg incubated by a pair of Tufted
Puffins Lunda cirrhata, in a burrow in the SEA CLIFFS display in the
AQUATIC BIRDS building. After more than 30 days of brooding, the
egg was found in the exhibit's pool with a fully developed dead embryo.
Among the more interesting new specimens added to the collection
during 1968 were:

nocturnal species from northern South America and the Island of Trinidad
has never been kept successfully because of its unusual habits and highly
specialized dietary requirements. In the wild it feeds only on the fruits of
certain palm and laurel trees. Three trips were made to Trinidad by
Bird Department members to study these unusual creatures in their natural
habitat and to collect them for the purpose of live exhibit. Limited success
was achieved with one bird that lived at the Zoo for more than fourteen
months on a diet calculated to approximate the wild fruits. Currently,
two specimens taken from the wild in July of this year are thriving and
feeding by themselves in a special quarantine room set aside for them and
a great deal of data is being collected on their weights, activities and feeding
regimens under captive conditions. If they continue to thrive, they will
be displayed in a simulated fiberglass cave that has been prepared in a new
exhibit for nocturnal animals to be called THE WORLD OF DARKNESS
scheduled to open here in the spring of 1969.
The most notable loss this year was an Imperial Pheasant that had been
in the collection since 1947.

NEWS FROM THE BERLIN ZOO
By Dr. Heinz-Georg Klos
During the last four months our collection of birds of prey was enriched
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.960067636363636" page_id="56364599"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
by two Augur Buzzards ( Buteo auguralis), two Chanting Goshawks
(Metierax musicus) and one Crested Eagle ( Lophoaetus occipitalis). All
these birds were imported from Kenya. From Mr. Charles Cordier who
is now working in Bolivia we received two fine specimens of the Mountain
Caracara ( Phalcoboenus megalopterus). This pretty species which has
never been represented before in our Zoo occurs in the Andean Highlands
and therefore seems to be rather resistant to low temperatures. As Mr.
Cordier wrote us, it had been rather difficult to catch these Caracaras
because the Indians in the region of the Po-opo lake believe that they
bring misfortune to them and therefore normally do not hunt the birds.
The mountain Caracara is unable to catch the wild Guinea-pigs which are
plentiful in this region: instead of hunting by itself it prefers to attack
eagles and to force them to let fall their prey. Our two birds settled down
very quickly after their arrival. They are always active and seem to be
very sociable with other birds of prey. They often take a sand bath,
especially in warm weather. The sexes are alike; young birds can be
distinguished from adults by their entirely brown juvenile plumage.
On June 16th, one Black Vulture was hatched in the incubator and hand-
reared by the head keeper of our bird house. The young bird has still its
juvenile plumage but in size he had already reached that of his parents by
the end of August. This is the fifth Black Vulture to be hand-reared in
our Zoo.

Unfortunately we again failed to raise the young Condor which hatched
on June ist, after an incubation period of 59 days. During the first
weeks the young developed very well but on July 9th suddenly it was
found dead. As the autopsy revealed, the parents had fed it with too
many hairs and so caused severe constipation. Nearly the same happened
last year: that time the young bird's stomach was overloaded with stones.
As the parents do not seem able to rear their young in the normal way, the
next chick will probably have to be hand-reared, like the Black Vultures.
In our Owl collection the African Spotted Owls (Bubo africanus) bred
for the first time and reared one young, and from our old breeding pair of
Snowy Owls we again got six young which were given to other Zoos.

At the sixth attempt (two during 1967 when chicks were hatched but did
not survive, and four this year when the first two eggs were broken and one
chick lived for only a few days), the Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise
has reared a chick to the stage of flying strongly, though not, as yet, feeding
itself.
We had actually given up hope of further nesting this year, but towards
the end of July after adding a little material to the original nest, the usual
clutch of one egg was laid, and as before, the male was removed, for he
chased the female whenever she came off. She is a diligent mother but
not good at nest-building, so we assisted by fixing a disused Song Thrush's
nest at the site and when the chick had become quite large and the nest
began to subside and tilt, we substituted a large mud nest built by
Struthideas.
We thought that the incubation period was longer than the usual twenty-
one days this time and the chick hatched on the 15th of August and left the
nest on the nth of September, a strong and apparently healthy specimen.
We have heard much recently on the diet of Humming Birds, but it had
not occurred to me that mice are a favourite food of Birds of Paradise--or
at least of this Princess Stephanie's--until we saw one being eaten by it.
This mouse was taken away because it might have been diseased or affected
by an anti-coagulant, but thereafter we provided freshly-killed mice and
the bird skilfully removed all the flesh, leaving only the bones, the bowels
and the everted skin.
Another interesting hatching is that of the Tasmanian Waterhen,
Tribonyx mortieri. The parents are birds bred at Basel Zoo during 1967.
In the spring, we put the pair out on the Three-island Pond, where they
are virtually at liberty for they easily leap across the surrounding moat and
wander about the Gardens, when all is quiet. The nest was built in a

clump of plants near the moat within a few feet of the passing visitors and it
was well concealed, but sometimes it was possible to see the gleaming red
eye of the sitting bird peering out from among the leaves. Seven eggs were
laid and two blackish chicks were hatched and are so far thriving. The
Australian Tribonyx ventralis was bred here in 1869 and in 1871, but T.
mortieri , so far as I know, has not been bred in this country.
One Pochard, six Tufted Ducks, one Sacred Ibis, five Peafowl, two Barn
Owls and two more Grey-backed Thrushes have been bred. Rufous
Babblers built and incubated eggs and when they had given up, two eggs
similar in colour to those of Hedge-Sparrows were left in the nest.
A rarely exhibited species is the Great Blue Turaco, Corythaeola
cristata , of which two young birds and an adult were received from Uganda.
A female Hawaiian Goose has been sent on deposit from the Wildfowl
Trust and this makes a mate for the male received from the same source in
1961. Two Ornate Lorikeets have been presented by Mr. A. Booth and a
pair of Namaqua Doves deposited.
The following birds have died and the longevity records may be of
interest, though the ages of some were not known at the time of their
arrival: a Magellan Eagle-Owl received in 1948 and the father of the young
one bred this year, a White-faced Scops Owl received in 1950, a Magellan
Penguin bred here in 1951, a Cock of the Rock and a Golden Hangnest
collected as adults by Mr. David Attenborough on his Zoo Quest to
Guiana in 1955 and a Green Broadbill collected as an adult in Borneo by
Dr. K. C. Searle in 1959.

months and 25 days. It was found in the Bird House with a compound
fracture of the left leg. The leg was set and put in plaster but a com-
bination of age and shock proved too much.

The smallest parrot. Colin Harrison has kindly examined the skins in
the British Museum (Natural History). He reports: "Allowing for the
fallibility of measuring the lengths of birds, especially when they have been
made into skins, I cannot find any significant differences in the size of the
various smaller species of Micropsitta. I think all one can say at present is
that, as a group, they are a little over 3 inches long. The tiny specimen of
M. nanina referred to by Sharpe in his checklist was, in fact, a very
immature bird."

Mother Carey's chickens is an old sailors' name for the Storm Petrel
Hydrobates pelagicus and any other small species of Petrel.
But whence the name?
Captain Philip Carteret, of His Majesty's Sloop Swallow , says that
during his voyage round the world they saw many petrels " to which sailors
have given the name of Mother Carey's chickens " (Hawksworth's Voyages ,
vol. 1. p. 318, ed. 1773). From which it is evident that the name was in
current usage in 1767. It is now generally considered that the name
derives from " Mater Cara," the Divine Virgin, guardian of all seamen.

Mrs. Charles T. Johnson, Lompoc, California, has a small aviary,
containing some forty waxbills and small finches. Included in this
number were an Orange-cheeked Waxbill male and two Lavender Finch
females. The Orange-cheeked paired with one of the Lavenders and
three young hybrids were reared during May, 1967.
The female parent died in December and the Orange-cheeked im-
mediately paired with the second Lavender, and two youngsters were
reared in January, 1968.
Russ and Neunzig have recorded Orange-cheeked x St. Helena and
Orange-cheeked x Grey Waxbill, but I believe this is the first time the
present cross has been obtained.

Included were seven Congo Peacocks Afropavo congensis , the first living
specimens to be seen outside Africa. The seven consisted of five adult
males, one immature male, and one female. Three of the males and the
single female died during 1950. A fourth male died six years later, a fifth
in 1965, and the sole survivor in February this year--after almost nineteen
years in captivity. # # #
In the last number of the Magazine I mentioned that Mr. Charles Lucas
had completed twenty-one years as Editor, "Australian Aviculture."
Mention might perhaps be made of a few other long-serving Editors.
Mr. Wesley T. Page edited " Bird Notes " (F.B.C.) during its entire run of
twenty-three years, less the final number.
Mr. David Seth-Smith was Editor, sometimes solely, sometimes in
conjunction w T ith others, of our Magazine for some twenty-three years.
Miss P. Barclay-Smith with thirty years to her credit, has surpassed the
foregoing. It is to be fervently hoped that she will eventually emulate Dr.
Erwin Stresemann, who edited " Journal fiir Ornithologie " for forty years,

Caius Plinius (Secundus) the Elder (A.D. 23-79), sa ^ hi s Historia
Naturalis , Lib. x, cap. xli: " Beyond all Psitaci repeat men's words, and
even talk connectedly. India sends this bird, which they call Psitace, with
the whole body green marked only by a scarlet ring upon the nape. It will
pronounce " Hail Emperor," and any words it hears; it is especially
sportive after wine. The hardness of the head is the same as of the beak.
And when the bird is being taught to speak, it is beaten with an iron rod,
else it feels not the strokes. When it flies down it receives its weight upon
its beak, and supports itself thereon; and thus lightens itself to remedy the
weakness of its feet." Hail mighty Caesar. We about to die salute thee!

W. L. Weatherly, Victoria, writes: " I am at the moment rearing four
Cape Barren goslings completely by hand. We are also rearing a number
with the parents. They are extraordinarily tough and easy to rear. We
removed two eggs from a clutch of six a week before hatching and placed
them in a supposedly self-regulating oven. The temperature, in spite of
frequent checks and regulations, fluctuated between 106* and 80 *F., and
the humidity never reached above 75 *. Both eggs hatched about a day and
a half premature, after I had " helped " them, a usually fatal process.
After that traumatic experience they were very weak and it took all my
skill to get them to feed. They are now well-grown; they had been
doubling their weight per week till one kilogram was reached--it then took
ten days to increase to two kilos! From all this I have concluded that as
ova and as very young goslings, Cape Barrens are virtually indestructible."

more subspecies, some Zosterops are very difficult to identify with

HANDBOOK of FOREIGN BIRDS vol. i, revised edition. By A.

Rutgers, edited by K. A. Norris. London: Blandford Press Ltd.,
1968. Price 21 s.
When reviewing Vols. 1 and 2 of the first (English) edition of this work
(Avicultural Magazine 1966, 72 , no. 2, p. 66) I warmly recommended them
but with the reservation that I did not agree with all the statements therein,
that the terms " species " and " variety " were wrongly used as if they
were synonymous and that a few (only) of the colour plates gave a faulty
impression.
This volume deals with the passerine birds. Its author is obviously, as
I stated previously, a bird-lover in the best sense of the word and one great
virtue of the book is that it does not give the impression that birds are " no
trouble at all " to keep. Practically all of the species likely to be readily
obtainable, besides many that are not, are dealt with. There are 147
coloured photographs depicting (unless I have miscounted) 146 different
species.
The least satisfactory photographs in the previous edition have been
replaced by better ones. The colour reproduction of many of the others
is better in this edition although it is worse in the Mountain Bluebird on
plate 143. Anyone who has had anything to do with getting coloured
illustrations into a book will, however, know the trials and tribulations
involved and that perfection is, as Cicero said of good government, "A
thing to be hoped for rather than a possibility." Perfection has not been

achieved with all these illustrations--though I think it has with the
Rainbow Bunting on plate 81--but they are mostly very good. The
commonest flaw is for russet and chestnut to appear too fiery and brilliant
(e.g. plates 94, 95, 68) but, as it can look a bit that way in the live bird in
certain lights, it is, perhaps, a fault on the right side.
There still appears some small confusion over species, races and
varieties. The latter word is, for example, used on page 144 in precisely
the same context in which " species" is correctly used on the previous page.
The races of the Avadavat and Golden-breasted Waxbill are treated as
races nomenclatorially but referred to as species (pp. 145 and 154).
I am doubtful of the claim (p. 58) that hybrids have been produced
between the Canary and Chaffinch and, from my own experience of this
and other corvine species, I most emphatically do not believe that, when
Lanceolated Jays fail to breed successfully, the cock " is generally the
cause of all the trouble," a statement for which no evidence is given.
These strictures should not, however, deter anyone from buying this
book. It is an excellent work and would, in my opinion, be cheap at twice
the price. D. G.

BREEDERS OF GREAT EAGLE-OWLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944749257142857" page_id="56364606"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
A Sussex reader reminds me that Eagle-Owls were formerly kept and bred at
Arundel Castle. I did not include these birds in my summary of breeders because
they were very probably Virginian Eagle-Owls Bubo virginianus virginianus.
I do not think I can do better than quote William Borrer (The Birds of Sussex,
page xvii) (1891): " Concerning the Owls formerly in the Keep of Arundel Castle,
which I believe were generally supposed to be Eagle Owls, and were mentioned as
such by Mr. Knox in O. R. p. 91, as they were for many years a great attraction to
visitors, a few words may be expected, though they have no claim to be called
Sussex birds. I may say that when I saw them many years ago I had no doubt that
they were the Virginian species, in which opinion I am confirmed by the following
notice in ' The Beauties of England and Wales,' vol xiv. p. 82, by F. Shoberl, where,
speaking of the Keep of Arundel Castle, he says: " The Owls which are kept here
were a present to the Duke from North America." This was published in 1813.
Mr. J. H. Gurney kindly made enquiries for me of the present Duke, who most
courteously gave all the information in his power, stating that he believed it to be
the fact that the Owls were introduced into the Keep by Charles, the nth Duke,
who died in 1815, and that some were still remaining when he himself came to the
title in i860, but that during his minority they gradually disappeared from the
Castle, though two were remaining in a garden in the town up to the end of 1869.
Mr. Mostyn, the Duke's agent, kindly forwarded me a letter from an old man, for
many years the custodian of the Owls, who states that they occasionally bred in the
Keep, producing but one egg in the season, and hatching it; but in 1859 one bird
laid three eggs, which produced three fine young, which grew to maturity. One of
the Owls, which had long been known as " Lord Thurlow," at last laid an egg, which
was the subject of considerable amusement. Mr. Gurney had a cutting from the
' West Sussex Gazette ' of 1859, stating that one of the Arundel Owls, believed to be
the original " Lord Thurloe," had just died, supposed to be about a hundred
years old."
J. H. Gurney (On the Comparative Ages to which Birds live, Ibis, 1899, 30)
quotes the West Sussex Gazette account, and gives the added information that the
death of this bird left seven birds in the Keep, one of which was 63 years old.
Gurney does not appear to have been convinced that these birds were other than
European Eagle-Owls. A. A. Prestwich.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any Member
who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of bird which
shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain
the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence
of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents. The question of awarding a Medal for the breeding
of local races or sub-species of species that have already been bred shall be at the
discretion of the Council. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford instruction
to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it is
published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young, and
be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to alllivestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid.
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not hearsay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.
