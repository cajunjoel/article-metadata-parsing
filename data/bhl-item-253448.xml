The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send
a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly in-
dependent of their parents. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids,
or of local races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species . These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 *\ On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [ name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

(Cossypha cyanocampter)
By C. S. Webb (London, England)
Few birds are more interesting from the aviculturist's point of view
than the African Robin-Chats of the genus Cossypha. They are all
sprightly and elegant with pleasing colours and some, if not all, have
delightful call-notes. It has always given me great pleasure to study
these birds in their natural surroundings, learning something of their
habits, and to introduce new species to this country. They are not easy
to locate owing to their skulking habits, but once their haunts are
known they are not very difficult to trap.

Cameroons.
Cape Robin-Chat (C. caffra). Transvaal and Kenya.
This interesting list is limited to the Cossyphas, but there are, of
course, in Africa a number of Robin-Chats belonging to other genera
and numerous species of Robin-like birds going under the popular
names of Scrub Robins, Bush Robins, and Forest Robins.
The Noisy Robin-Chat and the Blue-shouldered Robin-Chat are
perhaps the most attractive of all Cossyphas on account of their quite
remarkable powers of mimicry, particularly of other birds' songs
and call notes. The beauty of the Blue-shouldered species is well
illustrated in the accompanying plate, in which the artist has succeeded
in capturing the whole character of the bird. It illustrates one of
several specimens captured in the British Cameroons in 1947. This

G. S. WEBB-THE BLUE-SHOULDERED ROBIN-CHAT
species is the shyest of the family, in fact one might live for a long
time quite close to its haunts without suspecting its presence,
assuming one had not learnt its call-notes.
My first introduction to this species was during an expedition to the
French Cameroons in 1936, an account of which appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine, January, 1937. In this I described the
impenetrable second growth thickets in which the Blue-shouldered
Robin-Chat spends its entire life, rarely showing itself in open places.
My recent specimens were captured in dense thickets bordering the
Cross River near Mamfe in the British Cameroons. Pairs of these
birds live within narrow territorial limits, and although extremely
difficult to observe, they can be easily located once their call-notes
are recognized. If one hears a variety of sweet notes issuing from
a thicket near the ground it can be taken for granted that this is the
home of a pair of Blue-shouldered Robin-Chats and that they will
always be near at hand. It is rather staggering before one knows
something of these birds and their powers of mimicry, to hear the
curious and distinctive call-notes of the Green Fruit-Pigeon coming
from such a situation. I found little difficulty in capturing these Robin-
Chats in flew-nets, except that a great deal of discomfort was involved.
A convenient gap had to be cut through a dense mass of vegetation
so that small hanging nets could be set. In such sombre situations
these are invisible. It is difficult to imagine a more miserable situation
in the rainy season, with the foliage wet and dripping, the place in
semi-darkness, and mosquitoes galore. As I had to travel some
distance by canoe to reach the spot, I never had time to watch results,
but visited the place several times daily, making the final visit just
before dark to avoid having a bird left in the net all night. The
difficulty of extracting an entangled bird from a flew-net in almost
total darkness while lying on one's back in sodden vegetation and
being eaten alive by mosquitoes cannot be overstated. On more than
one occasion I found myself being attacked by marching ants while
doing this. My last recollection of the Blue-shouldered Robin-Chat
in the wild state was when I finally took up my nets and paddled
down the swollen Cross River as nightfall approached. In a dense
thicket, in spite of the rain, a male was pouring out his sweet song
and mimicking the calls of his fellow-creatures, long since quietened
by the darkness and the rain. His challenge, which could be clearly
heard above the roar of the flood-waters, was surely an indication to
the outside world that he was a happy king in his own castle, even if
it did appear to be a gloomy one.
The distribution of the Blue-shouldered Robin-Chat is from Liberia
and Gaboon east to Uganda.

BREEDING RESULTS OF ALBINO BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997973" page_id="56291436"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
By Pradyuman K. Desai (Bhavnagar, India)
Every now and then an aviculturist is the proud possessor of an
albino specimen in his collection, but very few are able to breed them
true to colour.
Albino birds are white, with a beautiful wash of pink, with red eyes,
and bill and feet are also pink or flesh-coloured. Some have normal
coloured eyes and feet, and these I call whites.
I have seen real albino common Red-vented Bulbuls (Molpastes
cafer). A true albino pair bred normal coloured young ones, because
nature will not allow albinos to breed albino specimens.
His Highness the Maharaja Sahib of Bhavnagar brought a beautiful
specimen of albino Red-vented Bulbul from Calcutta for his private
collection. It was a very big and bold-looking bird. I had a thought
to breed with him, but there was no albino female to mate with him.
Fortunately a light-coloured female was in the collection, which was
kept with a normal coloured male bird ; the pair was breeding normal
coloured progeny. She was separated and put with the albino male,
in the hope of getting albino birds. The albino male quickly took to
her, and when the breeding season commenced both busily selected
the building materials, made a nest in an artificial bush nailed on one
of the walls of the aviary, and were able to raise three normal coloured
young ones. I was very hopeful of getting from the pair a real albino
young one like its male parent. The survivors turned out to be large
and bonny specimens.
One day a bird dealer arrived with a few birds, and with them he
brought a white female Bulbul. She was purchased as a mate for the
albino male. She was not as large nor red-eyed ; her eyes and feet
were of normal colour. The most satisfactory point was her white
plumage.
The original light-coloured female was transferred to one of the
young males, in order to interbreed and to see the result of the mating ;
but to my despair they also bred normal young ones.
After a year or so my albino male and white female selected a bush
outside in the run and built a nest, laid two eggs, and began incubating
them. On the morning of the tenth day, when a man went to clean
the floor of the aviary, he brought an empty egg shell which he found
lying on the ground. I saw the shell and decided that there must be
a young one hatched out. Next day the other shell was found lying
on the floor.
To supply the natural food for feeding the young ones I used live
insects like grasshoppers, crickets, etc., and in addition white ants
were also given.

P. K. DESAI-BREEDING RESULTS OF ALBINO BIRDS
Both the parents were so bold and tame that they used to come to the
hand to take live food even before they had young ones. The love
for their progeny made them absolutely fearless. They were snatching
food before I could offer it to them, and in trying to secure a plump
grasshopper they got so annoyed that they pecked at my hand.
On the fifth day, to my surprise, the man came with a dead young
one, which he found lying on the floor. To find out whether they
had been bred true to the colour I examined the dead young one, and
from the growing pinions, the white ends, and pink roots saw that
it should have turned out white in colour. To have a look in the eyes,
I forced them open, and found the pupils pink. Though of no avail,
it was decided that it had bred true albino. The next day the second
of the brood met the same fate. I saw it was also white, but did not
examine the eyes.
That year I was not lucky in getting any more broods. The next
year I was fortunate to see two young ones of pure white colour. At
the same time, it was very strange that the young one which turned
out a male bird was the replica of his father, and the other was like
her mother, with exactly the same coloured bill and feet. Both the
young ones survived to maturity.
Despite a change of aviary with birds of a different kind and size,
they managed to build a nest and laid eggs. Unfortunately a Jungle
Babbler (Turdoides t. terricolor) got at her and pecked her to death.
That sad incident put an end to any possibility of success.
If these aviary-bred albino Bulbuls try again it will be a very rare
occurrence in aviculture.
After producing a pair of albino Bulbuls the original white female
passed away. A pied hen bird was introduced to the albino male.
They produced all normal coloured young ones.
To inbreed I had to keep a young female with the albino male,
which was the offspring of the light coloured and albino male. I could
see if they bred I would get at least one young one pure white. But
the result was negative.
The collection of albino birds was made richer by adding a pair of
white common Partridges (Francolinus pondicerianus (Gmelin)) ; of this
pair the male did not survive to breed. A coffee-coloured male was
then mated with the white female Partridge, whose eyes and feet
were of normal colour. This pair raised nearly twenty young ones, but
all of normal colour.
To get some white progeny, two pairs of young Partridges were
selected and kept separately. They bred after two years. Both pairs
hatched out two white chicks each time from a clutch of five eggs.
By this breeding, there were five white Partridges with only one
female. This pair did not survive to maturity.
The other males were given normal coloured females caught from

the wilds. These pairs bred normal coloured progeny. Out of which
I selected three females to mate with those three white males. I am
eager to see the result this year.
A white Pagoda Myna (Temenuchus pagodarum) bred normal young
ones with normal coloured female.
A female coffee-coloured Pied Myna (Sturnopastor contra) was mated
to an Andaman Myna (Sturnia andamanensis ). The hybrid turned out
grey-coloured, which did not breed. I suppose they were sterile.
There was one very noticeable feature about their beaks, which were
rather long like their mother, and colour was like their father.
Generally the inbreeding produces 50 per cent results, but the
normal coloured Partridges bred from white parents produced 40 per
cent results. The albino Bulbuls bred true to their sexes, which,
I suppose, is a strange occurrence.
I have tried to explain my results, which may prove of some interest
aviculturists.

By L. S. Crandall and J. Delacour (New York, U.S.A.)
It is gratifying to notice, particularly in Europe, a great increase
of the general interest in birds, not only in wild birds and their con-
servation, which is apparent everywhere, but also in captive birds,
when they are comfortably and artistically housed. To-day, bird
collections in the European zoos are often excellent, and much better
exhibited than they used to be in the past. If large, private collections
are fewer and less extensive than before, because of the less favourable
financial position of most of the amateurs, those open to visitors are
very prosperous, and new bird parks have been started in numerous
places. Only last summer, within a week, one of us was approached
by representatives of two big French cities, Nice in the south and Lille
in the north, and asked to undertake the planning, building, and
stocking of elaborate aviaries and enclosures in their public parks.
During the last few years, large exhibits of birds have been built,
particularly in Holland, either separately or as part of more general
zoos. As a bird park, far the biggest and richest of all is
" Avifauna 55 at Alphen-on-the-Rhine, close to Leyden. A visit to
this unique establishment is well worth while. It was opened in 1949 ;
Mr. Gerard Van den Brink, a self-made, prosperous local business
man, had taken a sudden fancy to birds two years before, when he
saw a few Pheasants in a friend's garden, and he soon acquired a
number. Because of the interest that people took in his private
collection, he quickly decided to build a public bird park, the equal
of which had not been seen before. With the help of Mr. J. Noordzij,

who had been a Curator of Birds at the Rotterdam Zoo, he succeeded
within a year in creating an astonishing establishment. There is no
doubt that " Avifauna ", at the time of our visits (May-June, 1951), was
a highly unusual display of a very large and interesting collection.
All groups of birds were represented, many rare ones, and lots of them.
Certainly the larger zoos and the great private collections of the pre-
war days were richer, but to-day " Avifauna " reaches a high standard.
The Park is small at present (eight acres), and rather bare. It was
an open field three years ago, and the trees and shrubs have hardly
started growing, but they represent an excellent selection of rare and
pretty species and, given time, will be wonderful. The Park is
now being greatly enlarged, and there seems to be unlimited open
space at the back for further improvements. The main gate and all
the accommodation is substantially and carefully built. The grounds
have been planned on formal lines ; there are long, straight walks
lined with poplars, and canals on both sides and at the back. The
innumerable pens and aviaries are excellently made of steel framing
and small wire netting ; they are planted with beautiful and costly
shrubs, and have fine lawns and fountains. The only objection is
the fussiness of the landscape and the doubtful taste of some of the
shelters, which look like miniature castles and towers. But most of
these aviaries are very good. They are arranged in rows and clusters.,
at different spots. There are also numerous enclosures for Ostriches,
Rheas, and other large birds, and for Storks, Cranes, and various
waders, many ponds and pens for waterfowl, Penguins, Flamingoes--
in a word, an array of all sorts of accommodation.
The aviaries are stocked with a large number of Pheasants, Quail,
and other game birds, small waders, Parrots, Doves, and hundreds of
small birds. They certainly look extremely attractive, but practical
aviculturists here have to make reservations. The Parrots were happily
cutting the leaves and chewing the twigs of the valuable shrubs ;
many delicate species had no, or insufficient, shelter against bad
weather ; newly arrived American Quail such as Gambel's, Monte-
zuma's, Mountain and Scaly, all denizens of the desert, and therefore
intolerant of dampness, were almost disappearing in the lush, moist
green grass, and had no shelter against the rain ; with valuable
Pheasants had been placed pairs of exotic Jays or Magpies, so that the
chance of ever finding an egg laid is remote. It seems that sound
principles of practical bird keeping have been systematically dis-
regarded, and ethical values forgotten, at "Avifauna". Mortality under
such conditions must be terrific, and no doubt the collection has to
be constantly replenished with newly acquired specimens. The waste
of plants must be equally great. Ostriches, Emus, and Rheas, for
example, were busy swallowing pretty alpine and herbaceous plants--
not to speak of the Parrots' devastations.

The indoor accommodation has also been queerly planned. There
is a large, rectangular house with good-sized cages all round, that
visitors look at through plate glass windows as they walk under a covered
passage. The cages are roomy and they were beautifully planted with
tropical flowers and shrubs, each being devoted to a very few chosen
birds, such as Grassfinches, Tanagers, and Sugarbirds. Unfortunately,
the roof of the cages is solid, and no natural top light reaches the
plants, which consequently cannot thrive, and must be replaced every
few weeks ; electric light is sufficient for birds to live, but not for
plants. New plants never look so nice as established ones, not to
mention the expense.
Another indoor arrangement is still less satisfactory. Following
a new and, we think rather unnecessary, fashion lately in favour in
some European zoos, a long, dark corridor has been built with, on
one side, a series of brilliantly lit compartments without glass or wire
netting separating them from the public. The theory is that the birds
will not leave their brightly illuminated cages for the dark spaces of
the public gallery. In fact they do, and we watched a number of
Waxbills and Weavers happily flying out and returning to other
compartments. Unless very tame, quiet, sluggish birds are used, such
cages are unworkable. They have another disadvantage ; they
should be at a considerable distance from the public, as otherwise
hands would reach out and disturb the birds. At present the cages
with a glass front usually adopted in American zoos seem more satis-
factory as the birds remain absolutely safe, and the glass is entirely
invisible when the lighting is adequately arranged. The only difficulty
is the cleaning of the glass fronts, which is easily overcome by a
suitable device to make them readily movable.
The above reservations have mostly to deal with the practical side
of the accommodation. As a bird show, and account being taken of
the fact that it is primarily a show, " Avifauna " is a great success. A
few minor alterations would leave it just as spectacular, and at the
same time would provide the birds with much more favourable
living conditions.
A very large, luxurious restaurant, with band and floor shows,
stands at the back of the Park, surrounded by ponds full of Flamingoes,
Pelicans, Storks, and other waterbirds. The grounds are beautifully
illuminated at night, a very great element in the success of the Park,
if not in the quietness of the birds. It is certainly not easy to reconcile
the necessities of a popular show with those of satisfactory bird keeping.
If, however, a few changes were made, "Avifauna " could boast of
having succeeded in solving a difficult but worthwhile problem.

One can only say about these species that they agree completely with
the Mallard in their actions and notes. The only difference that I
could find was in the placing of the head feathers in the behaviour
described above. The distinctive #C set " is present, but much less
pronounced than in the Mallard. Mallards, Spot-billed Ducks, and
Meller Ducks consider themselves so much one that the drakes
will fight together as they do with others of their own species. The
species mate with each other just as freely as with their own kind.
Only in the dominance reaction is there a noteworthy individual
reaction for the separate species. Spot-billed and Meller's Duck
females are rarely pursued by Mallards and the drakes of the first two
named species never manifest any dominance-desire toward a female
Mallard. However they are just as willing to mate with them as with
females of their own species.

Although the Spot-billed drake, while he lacks a special, showy
male plumage, is clearly differentiated from his mate by the colour of
his feathers and his bill, the drake Meller's Duck is exactly like the
female. The plumage has the typical lengthwise shaft spotting of the
females of Anas, without a trace of the tendency to transverse marking
in evidence in both the Spot-billed drake and the drake of the Black
Duck (Anas rubripes ), reminiscent of the eclipse plumage of the Mallard
drake. In his make-up the Meller drake differs from the Mallard and
the Spot-billed drakes in his extraordinary fondness for fighting and
in the parallel and accompanying tendency for " raebraeb " palavers.
The drakes defend their mates more vigorously against strange drakes
than do the Mallards, and they fight each other oftener in the wooing
of their mates. The female Meller Ducks, on their part, it is very

interesting to note, are especially prone to play up to drakes of other
species. There was one large hybrid between Mallard and Muscovy
that enjoyed the pleasures of love constantly--and therefore had the
pleasure of being most intensively incited by a whole procession of
different female Meller Ducks. This transferability is without doubt
connected with the lack of a distinctive showy male plumage. On the
other hand what the Meller drakes lack in fine feathers they make up
for in their extraordinary bravery in fighting. In rivalry between a
Mallard and a Meller Duck the latter regularly carries off the bride.
Even the Meller drake whose " lawful 55 mate had fallen in love with
the Muscovy-Mallard hybrid finally came off as victor because of the
stubbornness of his attacks, although his rival was twice as heavy and
not at all cowardly. This great pleasure in fighting and especially the
tendency to vigorously defend his mate made me suspect that I should
find the male taking care of the young, which was also predicated by
the lack of any sex-dimorphism. However, this expectation has not
yet been verified. In the few (3) cases when, for the sake of this
problem, I let the Meller Ducks lead their broods freely, the drake
took as little interest in the ducklings as a Mallard drake.
Both the female and male sexual and non-sexual reactions and calls
differ so little from those of the Mallard that it will suffice merely to
mention the differences. The female's " enticing 55 sounds high and
thin and can be immediately and certainly distinguished from that of
the Mallard and the Spot-billed Duck, which sound quite alike. The
decrescendo-call is also harsher and thinner. One could say that both
sound as though they came from a smaller duck. In the drakes the
most striking difference in comparison with the Mallard and Spot-
billed Ducks is that it says, instead of the two-syllabled " raebraeb " of
the conversation note and the palaver, a three-syllabled " raebraeb-
raeb " which can, under great excitement, become even a four-
syllabled note. I did not notice this by ear at first, but through seeing
it, because the lower mandible of palavering Meller drakes was moving
remarkably quickly. In the social-play of the Meller drake all the
usual behaviour sequences of the Mallard drake are found, with the
addition of nod-swimming which , in the social-play of Mallards and Spot-bills ,
occurs only as a separate behaviour form of the females. In the way in which
it is done, also, this nod-swimming of the Meller drake corresponds
throughout to that of the Anas females, in that it is not, as in the nod-
swimming of Mallard drakes, where it forms part of the head-up-tail-
up, the sequel to a long introduction and a prelude to many other actions,
but is entirely like that of the female a prelude and challenge, so to
speak, to courtship, without any preliminary shaking, drinking, or
mock-preening. It is probably no mere chance that the only swimming
drake with truly female coloured plumage also possesses this feminine
courtship behaviour.

Dafila acuta L.
A. GENERAL.
The general structure of gatherings of courting Pintails and
the significance of the detailed actions to be described, differ from
that of the ducks previously described in that the drakes do not begin
their social play independently of the presence of the female and do
not ignore these, so to speak, uninvited onlookers. Instead, the drakes
display directly in front of the females, forcing their courtship upon
them, a thing that the Mallard drake never does. A Mallard drake
never swims up to a female, or even after her, in order to perform his
courtship before her eyes, whereas the Pintail does do this. A little
company of drakes may begin to display independently of the presence
of a female, but as soon as she appears on the scene the drakes begin
to press around her. Having arrived near her, they " have to " go
through the introductory shaking of the bill a couple of times before
they can bring out a grunt-whistle or perform the head-up-tail-up.
Throughout this procedure one always has the impression that, just
like Mallards, the Pintail drakes, after a long " pompous " introduc-
tion, really " want " to display in the public square, but that they are
forced by the restlessness of the females to change the scene of their
display again and again. However, I am not quite sure that under
normal conditions Pintail ducks do not take more interest in the
display of the drakes than was the case on my pond, and thus stay
at the spot more quietly. 1 As my Mallards were much better breeders
than my Pintails, that would be quite possible. Anyway, it can be
said that Mallard drakes never interrupt their social play because of
the females' lack of interest, nor do they change its place nearer the
female.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND CALLS.
The conversation calls and call-notes of little ducklings, with their
corresponding body positions, are like those of the Mallard. But
before they can fly, at the same time that the voice changes, the drake
loses the two-syllabled conversation note. His voice changes into a
thin peculiar sound, reminding one of the notes of some song birds,
a fine nasal " geeeee ". It is one-syllabled and drawn out when it
corresponds in significance to the Mallard's two-syllabled " raebraeb "
as, for example, when driving tame ducks, and the Mallard drakes,
very annoyed, utter their fastest " raebraeb " and the females of both
kinds their " quegeg-quegeg ". As in the Mallard, a one-syllabled
1 This assumption proved absolutely correct. The Pintail courtships I observed
in Slimbridge, where these ducks breed freely, were much more stationary than in
Altenberg.

drawn-out call combines the function of a call-note and a warning
call. The reactions in the Pintail expressive of the intention of flying
up and going away, are similar throughout to those of the Mallard,
only the voice is considerably deeper and hoarser, and uncommonly
rich in rolling " r 55 sounds.

1. Inciting.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99277325" page_id="56291444"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
Inciting by the Pintail does not differ in significance or in mode of
application from that of the Mallard. Although it is certainly
homologous to that of the Mallard, it differs considerably in behaviour
form and note from that of Anas. In female hybrids of various blood
combinations it appears in all possible transitions between the original
forms. When inciting the Pintail raises the fore parts very high, and
if on land stands with the fore parts
erect (Fig. 18) and then moves its head
backwards much more closely pressed
against the body. The movement of the
bill, pointed originally toward an enemy,
and quite distinct in the Mallard, is
hardly noticeable in the Pintail, the
whole behaviour pattern being more
" ritualized " and even farther away
from the primitive form, found among
the Casarcina , than in the Mallard. The
depression of the bill in the head-articula-
tion is much less noticeable than in
the Mallard. One rarely hears the single
" queg " sounds any more. They follow each other much faster than
in Anas and run together in an almost continuous " arrrrrrrrr 55
according to the mood of the Pintail. However, the peculiar querulous
scolding undulating intonation is heard just as in " Anas ".

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992064375" page_id="56291444"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
In the Pintail these are more intense and more easily released than
in the Mallard. Even when one drives tame ducks rather roughly the
upper mandible of the female is raised and the feathers on the front
of the head are ruffled. The cackling sounds are like those of the
female Anas , but harsher and deeper. When brooding, a Pintail falls
into " hysterical 55 outbursts of gestures-of-repulsion, even though a
drake may not be anywhere near her, and through this the attention
of the keeper is often drawn to the fact that there is a nest with eggs.
The drakes, like those of Anas, that chase ducks in order to rape them,
leave such brooding ducks strictly alone.

This is heard less often than in the Mallard, mostly in the deep
dusk of evening when the flight impulse is greatest. It consists of an
uncommonly loud and deep two-syllabled " quahrr-quack ", but it is
impossible to say whether there are two slowly uttered " queg "
sounds, or many sounds uttered very fast. The lowering of the voice
and the tone within each syllable correspond entirely to those of Anas.

This corresponds throughout to that of the Mallard, except that it
seems to me that in the Pintail it is the drake rather than the female
that takes the initiative. However, this may be due to the weakening
of the reproductive instinct on the part of my Pintails as a result of
being in captivity. The female is usually attacked by this malady
more acutely than the male.

those of the males being very brightly
coloured. The function of the " eye " as

seems to be less important in these ducks

social-play. ^ Compare also a j wa y S fQ es [ n f r0 nt G f the drake, although
she has no bright specula on her wings. It
is surely not mere chance that the mock-preening of the wing plays
the greatest role in those species of ducks where sex-dimorphism of
the wing is greatest, such as Aix, Lampronessa , Chaulelasmus , and Mareca.

The position of the body and the shaking of the head which precede
actual display make Pintails look very long and elegant. The thickly
ruffled head, drawn in short, is an effective contrast to the stretched-out
body and the lance-like tail held almost horizontally (Fig. 19). The
shaking is generally repeated less often and for a shorter period of time
than is the case with the Mallard. Instead of this, a special behaviour
takes place between the introdu^ f ory acts and the more highly
differentiated display.

4. Burping.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989677234042553" page_id="56291446"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
While the head feathers are taking on the disk-like " set ", described
above for the Mallard drake, the head is thrust upwards and back-
wards, the bill being held horizontally or slightly downwards. The
backward movement is not fast, like the down-up act of the Mallard,
but slow and measured. At the same time the one-syllable conversation
note is uttered in a rising key, sounding like a question, and the
next moment, while once more burping out a second conversation
note, now in a falling key, the head is moved downwards again.
gr
The symbol e e e&amp;e e e expresses quite well both the head move-
ge e e e
ment and the call, with the ending of the burping behaviour likewise,
to use a little poetic licence, well represented. In contrast to the
display of the Mallard drake, which is linked with whistling, the
burping of the Pintail drake is not bound by an " all-or-nothing "
law but it appears to vary according to
intensity both as regards the compass
of the head movement and of the accom-
panying sound scale. Moreover, the
reaction-specific stored-up energy is not
reduced by a single burp to anything like
the degree that it is by the performance
of the grunt-whistle. Indeed, even with
a lesser intensity, it is certainly more
analogous, as a self-stimulus, to the intro-
ductory shaking. With a greater intensity
the burp is enriched by a soft flute-like
whistle that sounds like " pfiih ". This
whistle occurs exactly at the culminating
point of the head-and-call movement, like all bone-drum whistles
of swimming drakes, and also at the same point of time in corre-
sponding behaviour, i.e. when the wind-pipe is at the highest tension.
During the whistle the uttering of the conversation note is not
interrupted. The whole tone-picture can be represented by
pfuh
Doubtless the ascending note of the " geeee " is caused mechanically
by the pressing up of the head and the resulting tightening of the
trachea, so that one can tell fairly accurately both from the head
movement and the ascending note at what point the whistle will
come or whether the behaviour will die down without having reached
the whistling level (Fig. 20).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998060925" page_id="56291447"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
The only behaviour of the Mallard drake which is probably directly
homologous to the burp is that peculiar stretching-up of the head
while turning it to the female and uttering a drawn out " raeaeb "
which we have seen in the second phase of the head-up-tail-up (see
p. 177). In the Gadwall drake there is a form of behaviour with a
thrusting up of the head and a soft uttering of a call note, almost
voiceless in this species, which sounds more like that of the Pintail
drake but is, however, at the same time certainly homologous to that
of species of Anas. A burp, certainly homologous, is found in Dafila
spinicauda , exactly like that of D. acuta , and in Virago castanea , Nettion
crecca and N. flavirostre. In the marbled Teal (Anas angustirostris) the
burp is--most surprisingly--coupled with the " bridling " movement.
Without the whistle, but with a very similar sound, it is found in
Pacilonetta bahamensis and P. erythro-
rhyncha , in which the burp of the
last-named exhibits a clear transition
to the Teal group and in another
respect to the Shovelers. However,
Aix and Lampronessa also have corre-
sponding head movements, although
with quite different sounds. I con-
, _ . . . - - sider the burp, from the point of
Pintail drake. Compare Figs. 11b view of lts origin, to be a mimic-
and 38. exaggeration of the head-stretching
in uttering the call note. In support
of this we have, first, the questionably intermediate position of
the head-stretching which is part of the head-up-tail-up in Anas
and, second, the circumstance that an unmistakable burp is connected
with the head-up-tail-up in the Pintail drake (q.v.). Thirdly, the burp
functionally replaces the call-note in the Pintails, the Teals, and
Garganeys and can therefore be used independently of display, without
introductory shaking, analogous throughout to the long drawn-out
" raeaeb " of the Mallard, and in situations where this is a characteris-
tic note. One sees and hears the burp if a drake has lost his mate,
when a female flies above him, when a female utters its decrescendo-
call at some distance, but above all, like a Mallard " raeaeb ", in the
significance of a warning note. The burp behaviour of Aix and
Lampronessa are surely homologous to the " raeaeb " but have probably
been differentiated from the call note independently of the burp of
the Dafila-Virago-Teal group.

grunt sound that is so characteristic of the species of Anas is lacking
and the whistle itself is less sharp and has more of a " u " sound
(Fig. 21).
6. Head-up-tail-up.
With the Pintail this behaviour is rather different from that of
Anas. Above all the elbows lie flat on the back and the rump feathers
are not lifted. On the other hand, the movements of the head, rump,
and tail are exactly like those of the Mallard drake, including the
linkage of a lifting of the head with the turning of the bill toward the
female (Fig. 22). The subsequent head-jerking and nod-swimming
Fig. 22 . --The drake Pintail's head-up-tail-up with ensuing

and 13.
are entirely lacking in D. acuta. Of all other Anatince the head-up-
tail-up of the Bahama duck is closest to the Pintail. It is lacking in
D. spinicauda.
7. The Turning of the Back of the Head.
This orientation-reaction doubtless plays a special role in the display
of D. acuta as its effect is heightened by a special differentiation of the
feathers, namely the black plush cushion on the back of the head
already mentioned. The behaviour differs fundamentally from that
of the Mallard, which is only partially homologous, in that it is not
connected with a lifting of the chin. This lifting of the chin and the
down-up movement, which is perhaps only a mimic-exaggeration of
the chin-lifting, is lacking in Defila , as well as the two-syllabled
conversation-note that accompanies it in the Mallard drake. In all
the biological situations in which the Mallard drake says his
" raebraeb " the courting Pintail drake " uses 55 the burp with

with him of the long drawn out " raeaeb " used as a call-note or
warning call. Thus Dajila , instead of the two distinctive reactions
of Anas, has only one, which, to judge from comparative data,
must be considered as only secondary. Thus, even when the
Pintail is alone with the female, he woos constantly with the burp
instead of with chin-lifting, and the orientation-reaction released in
this situation, that of turning the beautifully coloured back of the
head to the female, comes mostly in the position of a finale to the
burp, or--quite often--immediately after the sound has died away.
The pointing of the bill to the female occurs, as we have noticed,
after the burp following the head-up-tail-up. When the drake takes

up the position with indrawn neck, which position is quite similar to
that taken at the beginning of the display, his head feathers are
raised evenly all around. One now sees very well the protruding
cushion at the back of the head (Fig. 23).
The Pintail has no other sexual behaviour and notes unless we
count a peculiar threatening position, which represents a formalization
of the Mallard drake's position of attack. Immediately before Mallard
drakes attack each other's breasts with their bills they swim against
each other with bills close to the surface. The Pintail drake and the
Bahama drake take this position as an attitude of threat even when
an actual attack resulting in seizing does not take place ; in contrast
to the Mallard drake he takes this position when he swims or walks
up to a strange female with the intention of raping.
8. The Combat of the Drakes.
Mutual pushing by drakes which have seized each other by the
breast feathers is found just as with Mallard drakes, but the Pintails
seem to have a greater dislike of having their feathers roughly handled

Bahama drakes are even further specialized in the same direction in

Special behaviour of this nature is lacking in D. acuta. The drake
swims around the duck after complete copulation, giving several burps
with or without whistling. (I now rather doubt this. The Altenberg
Pintails were not so very good and post-coital display particularly
tends to degenerate.) The duck then begins to bathe.

The Ministry of Health are lifting the twenty-one-year-old ban on
importing parrots as from 8th January.
The Parrots (Prohibition of Import) (Revocation) Regulations,
1951, published on the 28th December, 1951, rescinded the Parrots
(Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, which imposed a general
ban on the import of Parrots, Budgerigars, Cockatoos, and other birds
of the parrot species. The London Zoo was exempt from the ban.
Birds could also be imported for medical or veterinary research, or if
the Ministry of Health authorized the import. During the last two
years permission was usually granted by the Ministry for the import of
individual pet Parrots. The import of birds for sale was prohibited
completely.
The Regulations have been revoked because there has been no
significant recurrence of psittacosis in this country since the world-
wide outbreak which led to the ban. Furthermore, research has since
shown that psittacosis, which was originally believed to be confined
to the Parrots also occurs in seagulls, pigeons, ducks, turkeys, and
similar birds.
Moreover, modern drugs such as penicillin and the new anti-
biotics have largely robbed the disease of its dangers. Only one death
has occurred in England and Wales in the last ten years.
The lifting of the ban does not, of course, affect any other legal
requirements. For example, anyone importing a Parrot from certain
countries will still need a Board of Trade licence to import a seed-
eating bird.
A Ministry of Health official commented : " The ban was made
when there was a world-wide prevalence of psittacosis among parrots.
Gases are very rare nowadays and the discovery of new drugs like
penicillin and eureomycin has given us very effective forms of
treatment."

(Serinus flaviventris flaviventris)
By J. H. Walmsley (Port Elizabeth, South Africa)
In addition to breeding Canaries, Budgies, and many kinds of wild
birds, I have for some years been intensely interested in that fascinating
branch of aviculture commonly known to cage bird fanciers as mule
breeding. My object is to produce a completely new breed of domestic
Canary ; the many difficulties involved will be appreciated by those
who are also engaged in this interesting work, and it is therefore
unnecessary for me to enlarge on this aspect. I have on occasions
met with remarkable results in this field, and it is the object of this
short article to illustrate as briefly as possible one such unexpected
result. The facts will be of interest to those mule breeders who have
not yet tried the Yellow Seed-eater and probably to those Canary
breeders who are interested in introducing new colours into domestic
Canaries. The story will, I hope, prove to be of general interest,
and if it does anything to attract a few more recruits to the ranks of
the mule breeders I shall consider my time has not been wasted in
the writing of this article.
We South African bird lovers have much to be thankful for. South
Africa is a country which literally teems with all descriptions of bird
life. We do not have to take into consideration such hazards as snow,
sleet, fog, frost, damp, blizzards, and such like when we build our
aviaries. These conditions do, of course, occur occasionally in some
parts of the country, but rarely to the extent or degree of severity
as experienced in the northern hemisphere. We in the Eastern
Province, especially along the coast, have to cope with the famous
" South Easter ", but we know when to expect it, and act accordingly.
This is our most serious obstacle.
A favourite cage bird in this country is a handsome little songster
known locally as a " Bull-sysie " ; it has many other local names, a
fact which causes some confusion. The Afrikaaner will frequently
refer to it as a Geel-sysie which translated, means Yellow Canary.
On page 369 of Birds of South Africa , by Dr. Austin Roberts, it is
referred to as the Yellow Seed-eater, and the male and female are well
illustrated on plate lvi in the same work. The female is of a different
colour to the male. On page 21 of First Guide to South African Birds
it is referred to as Yellow Canary, Yellow-bellied Seed-eater, Shell
Sysie, Kleinsysie ( Serinus flaviventris). This work is by E. Leonard Gill,
D.Sc., M.B.O.U., F.R.S.S.Afr. I quote these works for the benefit
of those of my readers who have copies of them. To me and also the

which I am a member, it is a " Bull-sysie Incidentally, there are
several sub-species, two of which I possess at the time of writing.
As its name denotes, the Bull-sysie is a Serin, and therefore related
to the domestic Canary. It is an excellent songster, and becomes
very tame in captivity. I have never known the hen to mate up with
a Canary cock, but I believe that this is possible if a large natural
aviary is provided. I hope to carry out experiments in this direction
at a later date. The Bull-sysie cock mates readily with a Canary hen,
and the resulting offspring are good songsters and are good to look at.
They are very hardy, and relish sunflower seeds, but also do well on
ordinary canary mixtures. I have seen quite a number of these mules
and, without exception they have resembled the Bull-sysie in colour
and appearance. They do not appear to inherit any of the character-
istics of the Canary. I am now speaking from personal experience
only. When housed in an aviary with Canaries, these Bull-sysies
mix in well during the off season, they get very pally with the Canaries
and cheerfully crack up sunflower seeds as fast as the Canaries can
eat them ; they will also feed Canary fledgelings with great gusto.
As the breeding season approaches, however, they become vicious
and spiteful, and they make short work of any other cock bird in the
aviary which dares to stand up to them. They will puff themselves
up into a yellow ball of fury and savagely attack any other cock bird
which even dares to sing in the same cage. Even hens are not safe
from these attacks. On the other hand, if confined to a smaller cage
or aviary with a hen of his own choosing , he becomes a model of perfection.
He absolutely dotes over her. So much so, that he even objects to her
finding her own food. If his mate goes to the food dish he puffs himself
up and makes savage darts at her until she flies up on to the perch ;
he will then gorge himself on all the tastiest morsels, and then proceed
to feed her as gently as any invalid is fed. They make very fine
aviary birds, but I would not advise the beginner to include them in
a mixed collection.
Last year, having paired off my breeding stock, I found that I had a
very fine young Bull-sysie cock to spare ; this bird I left for the time
being in the main aviary. Soon afterwards I observed this bird
paying a lot of attention to a young white Border hen, this in spite
of the fact that there were two healthy young hens of his own kind in the
aviary, both of which were in tip-top breeding condition. I noticed
that he spent most of his time cracking up sunflower seeds for his lady
friend ; when she had eaten to the limit he would then get very annoyed
because she would not allow him to cram any more down her throat.
His kind attentions were not always appreciated by his lady friend,
and she would sometimes attack him out of sheer desperation. As the
breeding season got under way, I noticed this pair very busily exploring
the aviary for a suitable nesting site, at the same time making them-

selves most objectionable to the other inmates of the aviary. At this
stage I removed them to a breeding cage, a fairly large one, and
provided them with the necessary requisites. The nest pan was a
two pound jam tin cut in half. I have a strong preference for these
nesting receptacles. Within a week a fine nest had been constructed,
the cock doing his full share of the work and, in due course, four eggs
appeared. I had, of course, watched the mating proceedings, which
I should add are intensely fascinating. The cock puffs himself out
into a yellow fluffy ball, he throws his head back and sings enough
to burst his heart. I have never seen a cock Canary rival it. The
hen Canary seems to sense that she has a superior mate, and quickly
adopts some of his habits.
The first egg hatched out on the fourteenth day and the second
hatched on the fifteenth day ; the other two proved to be infertile.
I have bred hundreds of birds, but never did I see a cock bird look
after his young like that Bull-sysie looked after his, and from his actions
it was obvious that he considered that the hen should follow his
example. He looked after them so well that I was greatly concerned
about the possibility of the young dying from over-feeding, and was
greatly tempted to remove them to the care of foster parents. One
peep out of the chicks was sufficient to send him scurrying down to
the food dish and, if the hen didn't do likewise, he would puff himself
up and drive her down with a few good pecks. As the days passed
I noticed that all was not right with the colour of one of them. Where
the one was a yellowish green, which was expected, the other appeared
to be a dirty white with dark stripes. Hearing of this phenomenon,
several of my bird fancier friends came to check the rumour ; they all
agreed that they had never seen the like before. As the days passed
the colours deepened slightly until after the moult, when it became
possible to appreciate the colours more fully. The under parts are
now a pale cream, and the wings and tail are a very light shade of
blue with black stripes, like pencil marks, running from head to tail.
The eye-stripes are white, eyes black. In shape and song it resembles
its father. At the time of writing this bird is paired up to one of my
best cinnamon hens. I test all of my mules for fertility before disposing
of them. As my reader will guess, this pair have the place of honour
at the moment, and I am anxiously waiting for the results. Incidentally,
I entered these two mules at the last local bird show, the blue taking
a first and his brother a second prize.
Many people cannot understand why there are fanciers who prefer
to breed mules to Canaries. It's a big argument, but perhaps this
little story will help to clear up the mystery.

By Dillon Ripley (Litchfield, Conn., U.S.A.)
After the successful spring season of 1950, the nesting season in 1951
was a decided disappointment for me as well as for many other water-
fowl enthusiasts on both sides of the Atlantic. With certain notable
exceptions such as at Leckford and the Severn Wildfowl Trust in
England, and Mr. Livermore here in Connecticut, my impression
is that most breeders found that waterfowl did not breed freely this
past spring. In most cases presumably food conditions were the
same. However, I believe many people noted the late spring with its
damp, cloudy weather. Another season I think it would be worth
while to keep records of the actual hours of daylight throughout the
nesting season, for it may well be that there is a distinct correlation
between hours of daylight, feeding activity, and gonadal development
in our captive waterfowl.
I, for one, was particularly disappointed this Spring that my oldest
pair of Redbreasts (from Leckford) did not breed again. Their
breeding the previous season and the rearing of three young, was
the first record of this species' nesting in the New World. However,
this Spring the gander took two geese unto himself, his mate of the
previous season and another female from Leckford of the same age.
Having watched the birds for considerable periods of time, I cannot
help but retain the impression that the diffusion of effort required
in keeping his harem together and protected on the same territory
which he had chosen the previous spring was too much for him, and
the actual threshold leading to nesting was somehow never successfully
crossed. I hope another Spring to induce him to concentrate his
efforts on a single, monogamous relationship.
The other tragedy of the Spring was the loss of my breeding female
Philippine Duck to a Red-shouldered Hawk, the first time in my
experience that I have had one of these rather slow-moving Buzzard-
like Hawks take a duck from my ponds. In 1950 my pair of
Philippine Ducks had courted actively as they had the previous
Spring, the female making the typical sideways head dipping motions
accompanied by weak quacking characteristic of the Mallard-like
tribe of surface-feeding ducks. The male would swim rapidly by
her holding himself in one or two stiffly-assumed poses, either with
the head and neck elongated upwards, or sometimes rather com-
pressed, the head lower, near the water. They finally nested in late
June, laying only four blunt oval eggs with rounded ends, " like
billiard balls " as my helper described them. A Philippine naturalist
has since told me that he discovered a nest of Anas luzonica , the
Philippine Duck, on Mindoro Island before World War II, and that
it only contained four eggs, but that on another occasion he saw a

duck with six ducklings. Perhaps this is a tropical species which
actually has a smaller clutch than a normal temperate waterfowl
species clutch ?
One duckling was hatched out, a drawing of which is here repro-
duced, the first duckling of this species known to science. It unfortu-
nately succumbed, and I thought my experiences with these rare ducks
at an end, but fortunately we were lucky enough to be able to secure
fresh stock this past summer. And so with any luck we should have
another nesting.
An attempt to secure eggs from Iceland was a total failure as far
as I was concerned, all the eggs being smashed or having broken
membranes. Others had better luck, the Philadelphia Zoo rearing
some Eiders from Iceland eggs (they reared a Harlequin and some
Barrows' Goldeneye in 1950), and Mr. Mackensen this year reared
Tufted and Greater Scaup, Common Scoters, and a Barrows'.
Several species of my diving duck bred, but only American Red-
head were reared, while my friend Mr. Livermore had good success
with Rosy-bill Duck, Red-crested, Redhead, and a number of
species of the surface-feeding Duck including the little-known Florida
Duck, a small pale subspecies of the Black Mallard. Our Barnacle
Geese bred this Spring, while all the others passed up the opportunity.
Mr. Livermore, near by, found that none of his Barnacles bred, while
he had good success with Barhead, Magellan, and Gereopsis. And so
it goes apparently each year. Something breeds, something else fails.
I hope that eventually we will have a conclusive answer to these
mysteries.

By Kenton C. Lint
(Curator of Birds, Zoological Gardens of San Diego, U.S.A.)
We wish to record the breeding in 1951 of a Finsch's Amazon
(.Amazona Jinschi) in the Zoological Gardens of San Diego. The Amazon
was hatched on 1st June, 1951. In Mr. Prestwich's book, Records
of Parrots Bred in Captivity , we were unable to find an authentic record
of this species being hatched and raised in captivity to date.
Indigenous to Western Mexico, from Sinaloa to Tehuantepec,
a goodly number of these Amazons have been imported into the
United States in recent years. Many have been smuggled in without
going through the proper channels for the required period of
quarantine.
Our breeding pair of Finsch's Amazons were purchased in August,
1948, and went through a delayed quarantine period of nine months
before they were released and placed on exhibit in our collection of
psittacine birds. They were both young birds at this time, so we were
able to establish the age of their first breeding at the age of three
years.
Considered quite common here on the Pacific coast, this little
Amazon readily wins the affection of its owner by its pretty, comical
ways. As most Amazons, Finsch's Amazon usually speaks in the same
tone, whether it be taught by an aged man, a youth, or a woman.
It does not possess the pliability of voice which would enable it to vary
its speech, as for example, successively to a begging, coaxing, or angry
note. Its words are always in the same tone or key. Finsch's Amazons
do make wonderful pets because of their small size and pleasant
dispositions.
The general colour is grass green above and lighter below. The
feathers are blackish or black edged. The feathers on the back of the
neck or hind-neck are faintly lilac-banded. The front edge of the
wing is pale green. The primary wing feathers are black, the outer
webs at the base are green, deep blue at the tips. The tail has a broad
yellowish-green terminal belt, narrower on the two central feathers,
the outer feathers edged with blue at the base of the outer web. The
first five secondaries are red at the base, forming a speculum. The
tips of the secondaries are deep blue. The frontal band is maroon
or dark cherry red, extending to the lores. The beak is flesh-coloured
or white. The feet are pale grey. The irides are orange when adult,
dark brown in young birds. The female is not differentiated in colour,
but is somewhat smaller.
Twenty-eight days were recorded for the period of incubation.
Our baby was taken out of the nest and raised by hand when it

was five days old, as the parent birds stopped feeding it in a cage
where a mixed group of Amazons are exhibited. The eyes were not
fully opened until the eleventh day. When thirteen days old, feather
tracts were in evidence for the first time on the wings and on the
back. On the seventeenth day, pin feathers showed for the first time.
For a period of three months this baby was hand fed with a spoon
on our regular Wheat-heart cereal formula which is used for all of the
young Parrots, Cockatoos, and Macaws which are raised by hand.
At the age of four months, he was eating well, and independent in the
matter of feeding.

RECOLLECTIONS OF SOME SMALL BIRDS

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
From a somewhat early age until my late 'teens, I kept various small
passerine birds. For the most part they were kept in a garden aviary
with far too many others of their own or allied species to encourage
them to breed successfully. Looking back, I fear that the acquisitive
instinct had as much to do with their acquisition and retention as
did aesthetic or scientific considerations. Nevertheless, they were of
some interest and much beauty, and an account of them may at least
emphasize to others the folly of trying to keep too many ill-assorted
birds together.
First, both in time and beauty, came the Bullfinches. When I was
only six I was taken to a pet shop and told I could choose a pair of
whichever birds I liked best. Unprompted by any considerations of
the monetary value of the bewildering variety of Canaries, foreign
and British birds, I chose what I thought then--and think still--the
loveliest of all small birds, the Bullfinch. These birds were taken
home and installed in a sizable but otherwise most unsuitable wire
cage in the dining-room. After some time they were moved to my
bedroom. A Goldfinch and a pair of Canaries (in separate cages)
were then added to the collection and I spent many happy hours
watching them. The Goldfinch and the Canaries were allowed at
frequent intervals to fly about the room, but nothing would persuade
the Bullfinches to leave their cage, the door being often left open for
half a day without their availing themselves of their opportunities.
This was not due, as some protagonists of cage-bird keeping might
have believed, to their preferring two square feet of wood and wire to
their native coppice, but because in the unfamiliar surroundings of
a room the cage evidently represented cover to them, and they were
loath to leave it. This was dramatically proved some eighteen months
later. We had moved house and were now living in a more rural
district. One day the cage with the Bullfinches was placed in the

garden. Within a minute both birds were through a gap in the wire
that they had hitherto ignored and away. I was upset at the time,
but feel now that it was for the best, and only hope they had at least
a few months of freedom together.
Chaffinches were caught, escaped, were caught again, in such
plenitude that from 1932 to 1938 the large garden aviary was never
without Chaffinches, and the garden itself was always visited by
numbers of semi-tame ex-captives. It was my ambition to breed
British birds, and the first one I bred (wild Doves do not count, as they
breed as freely in captivity as domestic species) was a Chaffinch.
There were two hen Chaffinches in the aviary at the time, but as there
were also five male Chaffinches, two pairs of Greenfinches, three
Orange Weavers, two Java Sparrows, two Pileated Finches, a
Saffron Finch, four Turtle Doves, and a pair of Golden Pheasants,
conditions were not exactly ideal for their breeding. Nevertheless, one
of the hen Chaffinches built a nest and laid two eggs. Perhaps she
felt that in such a crowded world small families were indicated.
If so, she was quite correct. When the young hatched I ventured to
climb on top of the aviary and lie with my face only an inch or two
above the sitting bird. This scared her, but she sat tight, and when
I proffered her a small green caterpillar on the end of a twig, she not
only took it, but after biting it from head to tail in a manner that
would make any insect lover cry out against the wickedness of
Chaffinches, she fed it to a young one beneath my eyes. I threw
large quantities of caterpillar infested branches into the aviary each
morning and fed the hen personally with insects on my return in the
evening. One of the nestlings fell overboard--owing to lack of
spiderweb the nest was not so firm and deep as that of a wild Chaffinch
--but the other was successfully reared.
Greenfinches started off with an excited message from a school-
friend that " dozens of them 55 were feeding in his parents' chicken
run, and that he had caught two on the previous day and sold them--*
he was of rather a mercenary outlook--for 3 d. each. Next morning
saw us installed in his pigeon-house, connected by a long string to the
stick propping up a large riddle under which a profusion of corn and
sunflower seeds had been scattered. For some hours nothing happened,
but just as our hopes were waning a fine cock Greenfinch flew down
and, with his kind's typical lack of suspicion, hopped straight under
the sieve, sat down in the midst of the feast and commenced to tuck in.
Wild with excitement, we pulled the string with such eagerness that
instead of the stick merely removing itself and allowing the inevitable
results of the force of gravity to effect a capture, it flung the riddle
ten feet into the air, at which even the phlegmatic Chloris chloris
realized that all was not well, and he departed in some haste. My
friend soon, however, caught two pairs of Greenfinches which he sold

to me for a very trivial sum. They lived in the aviary for some years
and one of the hens nested frequently, but the young were never
successfully reared.
In later years this same acquaintance sold me two Bramblings.
At this time he had several bird-traps in operation, selling to myself
and others such as we would buy and feeding the luckless majority
to his ferrets. I was then appalled at this proceeding, but after all
older and wiser (?) people now use rarer forms of wild life to feed
racing greyhounds, which to my mind at least are far less useful and
likeable mammals than the much maligned, but in reality playful and
docile, ferret. These two Bramblings cost me a shilling each and,
except that they were thereby saved from the ferrets, it was money
wasted, since they very cleverly darted down and over my head when
I opened the low door of a small aviary in which they were temporarily
confined. It was, however, undoubtedly the best thing that could
have happened from the birds' point of view. Some years later I had
another Brambling whose story was less happy. At the time I was
working in a rather dreary part of London, where I passed daily
a very dismal little shop that sold bird and dog foods, and occasionally
had a few sickly lizards or a Canary or two for sale. This shop was
kept by an old and rather decrepit, bearded man who somehow made
enough from the venture to support, in life if not in vigour, both
himself and an equally old and decrepit white Barbary Dove, who
wandered about the shop as freely as her physical infirmities per-
mitted and regarded the old man as her mate. One day, to my
amazement, I noticed in a cage in the window a cock Brambling in
full summer plumage, but obviously crippled as to its wings and
suffering also from an advanced stage of scaly leg. On my inquiring
about the bird the old man became almost tearfully sentimental as
he told me its story. It had apparently been one of the victims of
his last bird-catching outing, fifteen years previously. He had sold
it to a man who had now tired of it and returned it to him. The old
ex-bird-catcher was most incensed against the Brambling's former
owner, who had caused its present condition by keeping it in a cage
" much too small Since the old man evidently considered its
present 8-in. square residence amply large enough, I shuddered to
think of the size of the prison in which the wretched bird had been
incarcerated for fifteen years.
Impelled for once by benevolence rather than acquisitiveness,
I paid the two shillings the old man asked for the Brambling and took
it home. Its wings were atrophied and incapable of opening fully,
and appeared to sport only about half the normal complement of
remiges. That this condition had been caused by close confinement
I have no doubt whatever, even though in saying this I commit a
scientific heresy, for we are told that modern scientific experiments

have proved that birds never allowed to use their wings do not have
their flying powers in any way impeded thereby, and can if released
fly as well as any others of their kind. Having seen something of the
performances of Pigeons and Canaries that had been kept in close
quarters, when released, I find this a difficult thing to believe. It was
more or less crippled, as to its feet also, so that it was out of the question
to enlarge it into the aviary. I therefore put it in a large cage in
my bedroom where it lived in apparent contentment for some months
and then suddenly died. Although it was October when I acquired
it, the bird was, as I have said, in summer plumage. I suspect this
was because its unnatural life had caused it either to moult irregularly
or not at all. I did, however, once see a wild cock Brambling in
summer dress of black and orange on Boxing Day.
Quite the nicest small bird I had was a Pied Wagtail. He was
picked up by my bird-catching school friend, who found him with
an injured wing. His captor asked sixpence for him, but as he was
in pretty bad shape, and I doubted my ability to keep him alive,
I stipulated that twopence should be paid cash down and the balance
in a fortnight's time if the bird was still alive. The Wagtail not only
lived the prescribed time, but soon became well and lively, although
not being able to do more than flutter about rather awkwardly
owing to his injured wing. He refused insectile mixtures and fed on
bread and milk and such insects as he caught in the aviary. On this
meagre diet he throve surprisingly and was always sleek and active.
He liked his milk-sop scattered in small separate morsels and always
showed some fear of taking it from a dish. If forced to do so, he
would approach very cautiously with many hesitations, finally dashing
forward, seizing a morsel, and quickly retreating some yards to
devour it. Exactly the same tactics are shown by wild White and Pied
Wagtails feeding from a lump of soft bread and by many other birds
that habitually peck up food of small size. Such birds, even when
they have learnt to eat bread, often seem to show some innate fear
at tackling a large piece. The end of the Wagtail was sad, for after
I had had him about a year, he was killed and eaten by a rat, that
arch-scourge of the aviculturist.
Of foreign birds, Orange Bishops were perhaps the most successful:
four were purchased and lived for years in the aviary. As is usual,
although out of colour when purchased, they all turned out to be
cocks. It seems rather strange that although in their native haunts
females are at least as numerous as males, yet most of the Euplectes
Weavers that one saw in England were males, even though imported
when in non-breeding plumage. These birds are ideal for an aviary,
hardy, beautiful, and above all tireless destroyers of vegetation, so
that they give no small assistance in the constant battle against the
plant world that the owner of a planted aviary must make in order

to prevent it becoming an impenetrable jungle. Mine ate milk sop,
peanuts, and insects, as well as seed, insisted on roosting out in all
weathers, and were always fit and active. Like all others of their
kind, they did not assume their proper colour in captivity, but in
the Euplectes Weavers this is no drawback, sinde the vivid fiery orange
of the aviary-moulted bird is as beautiful as the natural scarlet colour.
Red Pileated Finches were a shot in the dark. I had no idea what
sort of birds they were, but as they were only 8i-. Sd. a pair, I sent off
for them. What was my surprise when on opening the box I found
two birds of most unexpected appearance. I fell in love with them
at once, perhaps in part because their jaunty mannerisms and way of
lifting their crests suggested a miniature Jay. At first they were
rather scruffy, but they moulted out into perfect plumage and with
their soft slate-greys relieved by vivid black-edged crimson crests
(they were both cocks) they were--after the Bullfinches--quite the
most attractive finches I have kept.
Most interesting, however, were the Java Sparrows. This bird
has a great attraction for me. Its soft grey and mauve-pink body
colour, relieved by the black and white head, is extremely pleasing,
whilst the large bill is of such a wonderfully delicate pink that it
does not look in the least unprepossessing. At different periods, I had
two pairs, or at least two inseparable birds, but their behaviour was
as identical as it was remarkable. Within a day or two of their
being placed in the garden aviary, they commenced to roost with
the Turtle Doves. At evening they would each snuggle up alongside
a Turtle Dove, and if possible slip between its legs. They often got
the opportunity to do this if--as usually happened--the Dove resented
the Java Sparrows snuggling against it, and raised itself to strike at it.
Once the smaller bird was in situ , the Dove seemed not fully aware of
what had taken place, and would roost peacefully, though one
imagines somewhat uncomfortably, with the Java Sparrow beneath
it. When the Turtle Doves were nesting, the Java Sparrows always
chose an incubating bird to sleep under. On shining a torch on the
nest one would see the two white eggs pushed to one side, and on
lifting up the Turtle Dove would find the two Java Sparrows side by
side beneath her.
In the autumn and winter the doves were caught up each night,
and placed in a pigeon-basket in my bedroom in order to protect
them from rats, with which the aviary was constantly being invaded.
This entailed disturbing the Java Sparrows. These were also brought
in and placed in a cage in the same room. One evening I let out
the Java Sparrows to see what they would do, and to my surprise
they searched about, and on finding the basket with the doves they
got in through the wicker slots at the side of the basket, and settled
down&amp;apos;for the night with the doves. Thereafter I let them out in

the room (with the light on) and invariably they would go straight
to the basket, enter it, and spend the night with the Turtle Doves.
Since observing this behaviour, I am less and less inclined to be entirely
sceptical of the old story that small migrants may sometimes ride on
their larger fellow travellers. I do not think this happens, but except
for the difficulties that would be entailed in clinging on to the smooth
feathers, it does not seem much more remarkable than that a Java
Sparrow should use a Turtle Dove as the avian equivalent of an
electric blanket !
Now I have no small birds, my interest in the Crow tribe and the fact
that in 1946, the price of seed and mealworms was such that small
birds were very definitely millionaires pets, deciding me to concentrate
on the more easily fed corvids and pigeons. But the garden is visited
freely by Chaffinches, many of them half-tame, Robins, Dunnocks,
Starlings, Song Thrushes, Blue and Great Tits, and the less welcome
but unfortunately far more numerous Blackbirds and House Sparrows.
All these come with Jackdaws, Jays, and Rooks, for the scraps
put daily on the lawn. But the loveliest visitors--the Bullfinches--
scorn artificial food. Every February and March from two to six
come daily to feed on the buds of two prunus trees near the house.
This bird is often roundly condemned for its destruction of buds, but
it seems doubtful if it really causes much damage. These two little
trees are fed on several times daily by the Bullfinches for at least
four weeks every year, yet they are always a mass of blossom and
foliage later in Spring. And the pleasure the Bullfinches give would
be an ample recompense even if damage were done, for if there is in
Nature a sight more lovely than a pair of Bullfinches feeding in the
bare, dark twisted branches of a prunus tree, I have yet to see it.

THE ZEBRA FINCH AND ITS COLOUR

of the desirability of having more articles on the commoner foreign
birds arose, and Mr. Seth-Smith suggested that the Zebra Finch,
having nowadays branched out into colour varieties, might profitably
have an article devoted to it.
I know it is always a difficult matter to persuade people that even
though they may have no very rare birds, it is highly desirable to write
articles on whatever birds they may possess and submit them to our
Editor, so it is in the hope of encouraging them to do so and thus
perhaps set the ball rolling, that I am writing this article about one
of the commonest of all cage and aviary birds.

In my young days, and indeed until the nineteen-thirties, Zebra
Finches were just Zebra Finches ; very common, very hardy, and
excellent breeders. Nowadays however, besides the original wild
Zebra Finch, we have colour varieties such as the Fawn, the Silver,
and the White. The first mutation to occur--I think about 1934--
was the White form, soon to be followed by the Silver and the Fawn
in that order.
The White is, like the White Java Sparrow, simply a pure white
edition of a mainly grey bird. The Silver is, I think, the most
attractive of the three varieties as the chestnut and black-and-white
areas show up particularly well against the much paler and more
silvery-grey body colour. The Fawn has the same markings, but the
general body colour is a pale shade of fawn. A cream Zebra Finch
is said to have recently occurred in confinement in South Africa, and
I am told that a continental breeder has bred a pure white bird
which, however, retains the chestnut cheek patches. It will be seen
that there is plenty of room for experiment and possible development
of new colour varieties with this very attractive little bird.
Although there can be few readers of this article who do not know
what a Zebra Finch looks like, here briefly is a description of the
male : A small compact bird with the back and wings brownish-grey
and the crown, sides of neck, and throat grey, the two latter being
barred with black and with a pure black area on the crop. The
cheeks are chestnut separated from a white area round the base of
the beak by a black stripe running down from the eye. The sides
are chestnut marked and spotted with white, and all the under parts
are white. The tail is black broadly barred with white and the beak
and legs are orange-red.
The female's underparts have a buffish tinge and she lacks the
male's chestnut ear patches and white-spotted chestnut sides, as well
as his black mark and barrings on the throat.
Newly-fledged young resemble the hen, but they quickly mature
and are themselves quite ready to breed at about two months old.
They are widely distributed throughout Australia and are some-
what nomadic, wandering about in flocks from place to place in
search of the grass and other seeds on which they live.
Zebra Finches are, without any doubt, the ideal bird for the
avicultural beginner, being extremely hardy, simplicity itself to house
and feed, and quite the easiest and most prolific breeders of all the
imported foreign Finches--large or small.
In common, I expect, with most other aviculturists, they were
among the very first foreign birds I ever kept and they delighted me
by producing numerous families, despite the fact that being a schoolboy
at the time, I was away from home for long periods and so could not
always look after them myself. Very occasionally one does come

across a pair whose nesting activities come to naught owing to their
passion for making egg sandwiches--a nest ; a clutch of eggs ; another
nest; another clutch of eggs, and so on--but such misguided couples
are fortunately few and far between and generally speaking Zebra
Finches are the most exemplary breeders and parents.
They have been bred in a large flight cage indoors, but if possible
it is best to house them in an outdoor aviary, which need not be
large and should consist of a wooden shelter with wire flight attached.
Any type of nest box suits them. They will really breed in anything,
and if all else fails, they will attempt to construct their nest in the
food pot ! Perhaps the best nesting site for them is a wooden box
with a hole in the side and into this they will stuff hay, rootlets, feathers,
etc., in fact anything you choose to supply them with--including
green foods such as groundsel and chickweed and even torn-up strips
of newspaper !
During the construction of the nest the cock frequently enters the
box and, in order to encourage the hen inside, makes a curious cosy
little murmuring noise which I have always found quite impossible
to describe. His normal note is a penny trumpet sound and his song
--if it can be called a song--is really the same thing rapidly repeated
several times in succession.
The eggs, from four to six in number and of a faint bluish-white
colour, hatch in about thirteen days, and the parents will successfully
rear their brood on their own staple diet of brown Indian millet,
white millet, and the usual green foods. No extras are necessary, though
they may be offered small canary seed, and like all small Finches, are
passionately fond of millet sprays.
Zebra Finches, if given the chance, are practically non-stop breeders,
so it is important to remove the nests and give them a rest period,
otherwise the stamina of both the parents and the young will suffer.
Although a cock Zebra Finch's " bark is considerably worse than
his bite ", he is nevertheless a pugnacious little person, and while one
cannot but admire his defence of his nest against all-comers--even
birds much larger than himself--it must be admitted that his general
attitude is bombastic, and that although there might be no fatal results
to other birds in the same aviary, he and his wife, particularly when
breeding, are much best given a breeding compartment to themselves.
With regard to breeding the colour varieties, the normal grey is,
of course, dominant over all the others. Just as a green Budgerigar
is dominant over all other coloured Budgerigars.
The Zebra Finch varieties breed true and, by crossing them, split
ones can be produced in exactly the same way as with Budgerigars.

By W. H. Smith (Penzance, Cornwall, England)
Living almost on the sea edge--the Long Rock beach, Marazion,
Cornwall, and having only a tiny garden has its disadvantages in that
we seldom see many of the attractive little birds that one usually
associates with English gardens. Not for us the flute-like notes of the
Blackbird or the versatility of the Thrush. Each winter a Robin
visits us, and sometimes sings a little. Blue Tits have been bribed
to call by the stringing up of hazel nuts. Their familiar bell-like
notes announce their arrival, but like the others they are visitors only,
taking the crumbs of food and rapidly departing. They are friends,
but not members of the family. Just one very confiding and dainty
little bird--again only a winter visitor, has been encouraged to call,
by the simple process of grating a piece of cheese outside the window.
The Grey Wagtail, a most lovely little bird this, with mincing walk
and such aristocratic manners. More often than not, however, he is
driven away by the pestilent hordes of Starlings that frequent this
area, and fill the air with their raucous screaming. They swoop down
in numbers of anything up to a hundred, and despite their usefulness
or their entertaining powers of mimicry, as they circle round in their
thousands, I could find it in my heart to point a bren gun in their
midst and to indulge in a little slum clearance project on my own.
To help balance these disadvantages, there are also certain
advantages in living so close to the sea ; they are the orphans of the
storm. Once a Dunlin with a damaged breast, due presumably to
some of the many telephone wires that with the electricity conductors
infest this area. My wife and I christened him Charlie, and took him
home. He stayed with us for a fortnight, and after only ten days was
reasonably tame. We fed him on flies which we dropped into a fish
paste jar filled with water, also pieces of worms, and some proprietary
egg food. He also fed himself from little heaps of sand which we
collected daily from the beach. We kept him in a basement and on
the fourteenth day he was flying about, but did not seem too strong on
his wings, so that I thought I would catch him and take him on the
beach for a " practice flight ". This we did (using my old trilby)
and as we took him out I could feel him getting more and more excited
as the sound of the waves became stronger, but neither my wife nor
myself were quite prepared for what happened when I took the cover
from the hat. Charlie simply shot straight up into the air until he
became a mere speck, and then away over the Marazion marshes
until lost from view. He was so excited that we feared he may have
split open his wound again, but there was simply nothing else we
could do. We wish now, of course, that we had " ringed 55 him, for
as the various Dunlins swoop along the beach we wonder if Charlie
is amongst them.

W. H. SMITH-WILD BIRD " PATIENTS "
Another patient we had was a Swan. We found him limping badly
at the water's edge one sunset. Upon calling him, he waddled pain-
fully towards us, and then collapsed on the shingle. With some
trepidation, I picked him up, and was surprised at his lightness.
Safely tucked under my arm (slightly hissing at the indignity), we carried
him home. We had to pass some G.P.O. engineers who were repairing
some telephone cables, and as this was just before Christmas, 1950,
we wondered whether they thought he was for the pot ; however,
nothing was said.
Charlie II was installed in the basement, and was fed on bread,
cake, and biscuits, etc., dropped into a basin of milk (for obvious
reasons, too, it was just as well the floor was of cement). Charlie II
was only with us for three days, yet in even so short a time he became
very friendly. My wife especially he knew, and he would make a soft
whinnying noise whenever she entered the basement. Our cat and
dog were very interested to see the new tenant, but upon our opening
the door and meeting the new arrival face to face, and being con-
fronted with a long, aggressively outstretched neck, wide open beak
emitting hissing sounds like the blow-off valve of a boiler, Messrs. Dog
and Cat decided that their curiosity had been sufficiently satisfied.
Mr. Munelly, the well known R.S.P.C.A. Inspector, collected him
the third day, and showed us the little sores on the webs of the bird's
feet caused by the shingle and aggravated by the salt water. He took
him away and put him on a fresh-water pond at Hayle, and very
dignified Charlie II looked when we saw him a few days later. We
regretted his going, and had a feeling that had he stayed with us much
longer he would have followed us about like a dog. One word of
advice the Inspector did give us was to beware of rescuing a Gannet,
which bird, he said, would chop off one's fingers with its powerful bill.
A third casualty was a Razorbill, but it was so badly hurt we had to
put it out of its misery. Unable to help himself, his wings and feathers
being coated with oil, he had been dashed ashore during a storm.
The smallest patient we ever had was the wildest of them all, a
baby Blue Tit. The front of our house not being as tall as the rear,
he was able to fly over but unable to return. It was with positive
relief we watched Tommy go. He was brought up on bread and milk
with greenfly and water with a dash of Epsom salts in it. He seemed
to thrive on the diet, but except for the first two days only, he was
not finger tame. When we let him go through the open window, he
made straight for the next door neighbour's bean sticks, and was
diligently searching them for twenty minutes to half an hour.
Just to conclude this short article I should like to say that we have
not had any waifs and strays last year, but as a matter of interest for
approximately three weeks during July a Pelican arrived every
evening at seven and settled on the small lake opposite Marazion

where he went, and he has gone completely now.

Despite the weather conditions J. H. Reay had a successful season
and was satisfied with his breeding results. He writes : " Reared
Princess of Wales, observation confirmed Holmes Watkins' statement
that with this species the incubation period is only seventeen days ;
also Bourkes, Redrumps--normal and yellow--Cockatiels, Stanleys,
and Rosellas were reared. I have just imported three pairs of Plum-

A. Decoux considers last season was not a very good one. Neverthe-
less, he bred the following species : Rock Pebbler, Stanley, Red-
rumped, Bourke, Queen Alexandra's, Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet,
Red-collared Lorikeet, various lovebirds, Ashy Dove (Claravis pretiosa),
Peruvian ( Chamcepelia cruziana) and Talpacoti Ground Doves, Common
and Brush Bronze-winged and Bleeding-heart Pigeons, and many

Some of the ornamental waterfowl in the Royal Parks breed from
time to time and it is not the usual practice to pinion the young birds ;
there are, therefore, occasional escapes. The Committee on Bird
Sanctuaries in the Royal Parks has decided that these full-winged
offspring should be ringed, so that in the event of their wandering or
coming to grief they will not be mistaken for genuine wild birds. In
future all young birds will be ringed with the Society's special blue
rings.

succeeded in breeding many birds. The most interesting result was the
breeding of the Black-crested Finch ( Lophospingus pusillus), possibly
for the first time on the Continent ; two nests were reared in succession.
Other birds bred included Swainson's Sparrow, Yellow Sparrow

Leo A. Ara, Calcutta, writes of his Lovebirds : " I've bred the
Peach-faced and Masked since 1936, Fischer's since 1937, Nyassaland,
Blue Masked, Black-cheeked since 1941. Some years ago, when good
old Mr. Frost was collecting birds in Calcutta, I mentioned to him that
I had hybrids of A. taranta X A. per sonata and A. taranta X A. Jischeri.
He told me that A. taranta had not been known to hybridize with the
others. The taranta-personata hybrid I have now is larger than the
ordinary Masked and has a red forehead, black cheeks and throat,
orange breast, blue rump, a little red round the bare white skin of the
eye, and red beak. The hybrids are as a result of there being no
Abyssinian hens in the aviary. I have had no Madagascar hens either,
with the result that a cock Madagascar paired off with a hen Peach-
faced. There were five eggs but none hatched out. They were a funny
pair altogether as at no time did she allow him to go into the nest,
not even to sit at the entrance."

Many members will have read reports in the daily press of the
friendly rivalry of the States of Texas and Louisiana to replace
" Peter " and " Paul ", the St. James's Park Pelicans that died
recently. " Peter " had lived in the Park for nearly fifty years ;
" Paul," a much younger bird, lived only a few weeks after the loss
of his companion.
There have been Pelicans in the Park since the reign of Charles II :
the first was presented to Charles by the Russian Ambassador. An
account is given in John Evelyn's diary :--
9th February, 1665.--" I went to St. James's Parke, where I saw
various animals, and examined the throate of the Onocratylus or
Pelican, a fowle between a Storke and a Swan ; a melancholy water-
fowle brought from Astracan by the Russian Ambassador. It was
diverting to see how he would toss up and turn a flat fish, plaice or
flounder, to get it right into his gullet at its lower beak, which being
filmy, stretches to a prodigious wideness when it devours a great fish."
So that a tradition of nearly 300 years should remain unbroken the
London Zoo lent one of its Pelicans pending the arrival of the
replacements.

A young Common Tern that was hatched on a gas stove in
Massachusetts, featured on a Boston television show, and picked up in
a starving condition on a Bronx rooftop was placed on exhibition in
the Bronx Zoo on 9th November, 1951. The story behind the bird
involves the most extraordinary coincidence in the memory of Zoo
officials.
It started on 29th September when Patsy Tomasicchio, of 730 Garden
Street, the Bronx, found a helpless bird on the roof of his apartment
house. Not knowing what it was, but realizing that it needed help, he
took it to the Bronx Zoo and turned it over to George Scott, the Head
Keeper of Birds.
Mr. Scott recognized it as a young Common Tern, a bird found

along the Atlantic coast, and diagnosed its difficulty as starvation. He
placed bits of fish before the bird, but it refused to eat unless he fed it
by hand, a piece at a time.
The bird had a metal band on one leg, with a serial number and
directions for sending the band to the Fish and Wildlife Service in
Washington. The band was removed and mailed and the bird remained
in the quarantine room of the Zoo's Bird House, where keepers could
feed it regularly through the day.
During October Eric Kinsey, the Californian ornithologist, paid a
visit to General Curator Lee S. Crandall, of the Zoo, and while he was
being shown through the Bird House the young Tern was pointed out
to him and comment was made that it had been brought in and was
being fed by hand.
Mr. Kinsey continued his journey to Massachusetts to call on
G. L. Roberts, a business associate in the neighbourhood of Boston.
His associate, who is not an ornithologist, mentioned that a neighbour
of his, Charles H. Gamage, treasurer of the Lynn, Mass., Daily
Evening Item , had recently reared and released a Common Tern which
had always been hand-fed, and he wondered whether it would be
able to find food by itself.
Remembering the bird he had seen in the Bronx Zoo, Mr. Kinsey
was able to answer that he was sure Mr. Gamage's Tern would make
out all right, because it was being hand-fed three times a day in the
Bronx Zoo. There was no doubt in his mind that it was the same bird,
even though Mr. Gamage was said to have banded the bird and there
was no band on it when Mr. Kinsey saw it.
Mr. Kinsey's comments were passed on to Mr. Gamage by his
neighbour, Mr. Roberts, and the early part of the Tern's history was
relayed to the Zoo by Mr. Gamage.
On 15th July, 1951, he said, one of his children found the Tern's egg
on the beach at the Isle of Shoals, near the Massachusetts-Maine
border. The Gamages took the egg home, placed it in a strawberry
box lined with a towel, and set it near the pilot light on their gas stove.
The next morning the egg hatched and a baby Tern stepped out.
The Gamages fed it bits of fish and it grew rapidly. When it was
old enough to fly they attached a Fish and Wildlife band and attempted
to liberate it. Every time they turned it loose, even from a buoy well
offshore, in an area where other Terns were flying, the bird flew for a
short time and came back to them. It never did imitate others of its
kind and catch live fish, although it often flew low over the water and
could see fish below the surface.
On 19th September " Fish-fish ", as they called the Tern, was a
guest on Norman Harris's " Living Wonders " television programme in
Boston, and ate, bathed, and gave its shrill, squeaking call for the
audience.

Still trying to get rid of their guest, the Gamages liberated it as usual
on 25th September, and that time it failed to return. Many Terns
were flying south at that time, and they supposed that " Fish-fish 55
joined the migrating members of his kind. Apparently it did attempt
to fly south, but not knowing how to find food by itself its strength
lasted only until it reached the New York area. Then, either lost or
blown inland, it came to rest on a roof-top only a block from the
Bronx Zoo.
That it was found and brought to the Zoo is not unusual, but that a
travelling ornithologist should see and remember the bird, and by
chance be able to connect it directly with the family that hatched, fed,
and liberated it, is as far as the Zoo staff is concerned, an almost
unbelievable coincidence. It is believable, however, because the Fish
and Wildlife Service band that Mr. Gamage attached bore the number

collection.
Three Black Swans ( Cygnus atratus) bred during 1951 by Lord
Wrottesley have been presented by him, and other presentations
include a Lapwing ( Vanellus vanellus), a Greater Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo ( Kakatoe galerita ), and a small collection of various Waxbills.
The birds deposited are four Brown Pelicans ( Pelecanus occidentalis) ;
one Pink-backed Pelican (P. rufescens) ; two Eastern White Pelicans
(P. roseus) ; two Crested Pelicans (P. crispus) ; an Osprey ( Pandion
hali&amp;tus), and a Little Pied Flycatcher ( Muscicapula m. melanoleuca ),
while those received in exchange include two Rosy-faced Lovebirds
(Agapornis roseicollis) ; a pair of Southern White-cheeked Finch Larks
(Eremopterix leucotis smithii) ; a pair of Rain Quail ( Coturnix coroman --
delica) ; a pair of Red-faced Weavers ( Quelea erythrops ) ; and a Siskin
(Carduelis spinus ).
The breeding pair of Great Eagle-owls have commenced preliminary
scrapings in the peat moss on the floor of their shelter. This handsome
bird is on the British list as a rare visitant. A pair seen in Scotland
during the war were thought to be nesting, and it is a pity that this was
never verified, for it would, of course, have constituted a first record
for the British Isles.

BIRD WONDERS OF AUSTRALIA. By A. H. Chisholm.

Illustrated. 285 pages. Sydney and London : Angus and
Robertson, 1948. 155-.
This revised edition--the book made its initial appearance in 1934--*
is a compilation of curiosity-arousing information about " unusual "
birds--a sort of " Believe It Or Not " collection of out-of-the-ordinary
facts and theories concerning the behaviour of certain species of
birds " down under
Since the author deals with the little-known types of behaviour of
given birds, his book is quite likely to find favour not only with bird-
lovers as such, but with anyone at all interested in bird behaviour.
Few persons know that the Satin Bower Bird constructs what Chisholm
calls a " playhouse ", a " museum ", and a " theatre ", and that the
decorative materials employed for the purpose are blue, yellowish-
green, or creamy-yellow. Always they contain something in blue.
And, lo and behold, the Spotted Bower Bird in addition has a pro-
nounced flair for painting his bower--with, of all things, chewed-up
grass mixed with saliva ! The chapter devoted to the Lyre Bird
reveals this unique creature as a great mimic, emphasizing the fact
that both the song as well as the display indulged in are largely
recreational. In still another fascinating chapter we are given some
insight into the quaint antics of mound-building birds--the Mallee-
fowl, the Jungle-fowl, and the Scrub Turkey, which at times bury as
many as from twenty to thirty-five eggs in a mound, heated by the
sun or else by the warmth produced by decaying vegetation !
There are many other intriguing chapter titles, as " The Land of
Parrots ", " Guests of the Mistletoe ", " Queer Relations of Birds and
Insects ", etc., etc. In sum, the book affords its readers a widely
diversified fare, the chapters being uneven so far as treatment and
nature of subject matter is concerned. But this unevenness is not
likely to prevent the book from being widely read. Exceptionally
clear photographs greatly add to the charm of this book, many
depicting birds in unusual poses and situations.

A most delightful book. The account of the author's experiences

opinion such digressions are of great charm and interest. It must not
be thought that birds are neglected. On the contrary, the reader
will learn a good deal about the breeding habits of Great Northern
Divers, Purple Sandpipers, and other species likely to intrigue the
stay-at-home bird-watcher.
The reviewer cannot agree with the inference (p. 146) that serious
ornithologists are of coarser fibre and less sensitive to the beauties of
nature than shooting men ; and finds it hard to believe that the
Icelandic Snow-Bunting differs from its species elsewhere in not
feeding its young after they leave the nest. Such points are, however,
minor irritations in an otherwise excellent book which should give
pleasure alike to bird-watchers, ramblers, sociologists, and armchair-
travellers. It is illustrated with many excellent photographs, only
one, alas, in colour.

Expedition to Tamaulipas, Nevo Leon, and Goahuila, with an
Appendix briefly describing all Mexican birds. By George
Miksgh Sutton. Illustrated with water-colour and pen-and-ink
drawings by the author. Norman : University of Oklahoma
Press, 282 pages, 1951. $10.00.
This is one of the most interesting and readable bird books which
have come into this reviewer's hands. It is interesting because we have
so few books devoted to the birds of Mexico, concerning which many
American bird lovers, especially those living in California, Texas,
and other states not far distant from Mexico, are, to say the least,
curious. It is readable because it is written in an informal, narrative
style, spiced with personal experiences and observations which at
once take the book out of the class of more or less impersonal, technical
reference works, and which are quite likely to prompt a reading of
the book from beginning to end. Best of all, the book is factual and
thoroughly objective in its point of view, dependable in the descrip-
tions of the numerous Mexican and American birds seen, their exact
identification, their habits, and their habitats.
As you read Mexican Birds , you will find yourself accompanying in
spirit the three experienced birdmen--the author, Thomas Dearborn
Burleigh, and the late John Bonner Semple--and enjoying their
company very much indeed. You will share their discoveries as well
as their disappointments and delight in their observations of bird
song, bird flight, and bird behaviour in general. Of the Mexican
species encountered by this expedition, many will be new to you, while
many of the American birds you will have met before. You will enjoy
immensely the birds appearing in water-colours as well as in black-
and-white drawings, because they are very faithful and exact--very

much " alive ". These splendid illustrations alone, indicative as they
are both of the author's artistic ability as was as of his sharp perception
of birds individual appearance and habit, are worth more than the
price asked for this handsome volume.
To give you a good idea of the author's writing, I can do no better
than quote, in part, his hearing the Brown-backed Solitaire or Jilguero
for the first time :
Hardly had I found firm footing beneath the spreading branches
when the song began again, directly overhead. This time the opening
syllable--a sharp, ringing note--stirred my memory. Kler / it
started. Then another kler , and another, then that sparkling
shower, that " bright effluence of bright essence increate ", which
poured over and all around me. It was incredible. The song was so
loud and clear that I could almost feel it falling . . .
I did not know it at the time, but Kler was a Brown-backed
Solitaire ( Myadestes obscurus ), a truly celebrated songster, beloved
of the Mexicans as a cage-bird and called by them the jilguero. All
these solitaires were really thrushes, members of the family
Turdidae . . .
Owing to its readability and splendid " practical " beauty, Mexican
Birds should find a favourite place on the bookshelves of all " bird-
minded " persons. There is a useful appendix describing clearly and
concisely all Mexican birds.

National Cage Bird Show at Olympia.
The National Cage Bird Show was held at Olympia on 6th, 7th, and 8th December,
in the hall of the same name, and the lighting, heating, and accommodation were
a considerable improvement on the previous year, both for the competitors and the
trade exhibitors. For a change, too, the weather was favourable, being mild and
free from rain, cold, or fog; in consequence the attendance was greater than the
previous year. Although the total entry was not a record, it was very close to one,
and the quality on the whole was high. Budgerigars created a new record of over
2,000 entries, and the Foreign classes were more numerous and well supported.
Once again, Messrs. Norris and Silver were judging, and the Duke of Bedford
graciously undertook the psittacine classes.
To illustrate the care which had been given to detail by the organizers, it may be
mentioned that electric thermostatically controlled heating bars were fitted under
some of the staging. Flowever, even the staging came in for criticism in some quarters.
It is unfortunate that visitors will crowd round the foreign birds in particular to such
an extent that it is almost impossible to see those on the lowest tier. Throughout
the three days, whilst the exhibition was open, it was very difficult to make a thorough
inspection of all classes.
Where an exhibitor had entries in more than one section, such as Foreign and
British--his name and address was indexed in a special section of the catalogue--
a most irritating practice, which confuses both stewards and public alike.
The classification was well planned with one or two minor exceptions. No Shama
was exhibited, although there are many good ones now in the country, because they
were to compete with Tanagers and Fruitsuckers. Only one pair of Zosterops was
entered to compete with small Tanagers ; this class had nine entries and seven awards,
yet the Zosterops were unplaced. In view of the number of Foreign entries, the time
is obviously approaching when wrong classing will penalize the exhibitor. Indeed
it was apparent that sufficient care in dispatching and entering birds was not
being exercised in some instances--having made more than one entry in one class,
several exhibitors failed to place their entries in the correct sequence, with the result
that one found some birds incorrectly labelled. For example, a " Dartford Warbler"
might appear in the catalogue as a " Black Cap "--not through ignorance, but only
carelessness. Moreover, when the total entry is sufficient to engage the services of
three judges, it is too much to expect errors to be rectified, as they most probably
are not revealed until most of the judging is completed, and may entail complete
revision of the awards in a class judged earlier on. Some exhibitors would be well
advised to give greater consideration to quality than quantity, a bird shown in
anything but top condition can do shows more harm than good ; there is generally
some meddler searching for the opportunity to raise a howl about cruelty of bird
keeping.
The major awards were as follows : Best Foreign, Mr. R. C. J. Sawyer's pair of
Short-billed Minivets, these birds were cage moulted and shown in wonderful condition.
The best Parrot-like award was gained by a lovely cock Manycolour. On the whole
the Parrot-like birds were disappointing in numbers, this of course being due to the
limited stock available for exhibiting to-day. One exhibit also deserves special men-
tion, a pair of Yellow-headed Gouldians by Mr. Dulanty. This is the first time they
have ever been benched in the country. Visitors were also able to see many welcome
reappearances such as the Naked-throated Bell-bird, Touracous, Cissas, Toucans,
and Toucanettes, Pittas, Wilson's Bird of Paradise, liumming Birds, Sugar Birds,
and Sunbirds. Definitely, the exotics are coming back, and obviously are once
more the centre of attraction to the casual visitor.
The smaller birds were also very well represented, both among the seedeaters
and softbills. Among the Parrots, there was not much to report. The Manycolour
well deserved his position; some of the others were very fine specimens; some
also were poor specimens, and not representative of the stock we have in the country.
The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo was a nice bird, and undoubtedly of some character,
but under normal conditions he would probably have been disqualified for using
his owner's razor to improve his tail. One pair of Parrots receive my condolences,
a nice pair of Jendaya Conures. I think they were very unlucky in being placed
third below the pair and odd cock Derbyans.

be one to which we look forward with great expectation.

Other Aspects of the National Show.
With memories of past correspondence in the A.M. I felt rather like " a merlin
in a flock of starlings " (as the Faeroese, with apt simile, term someone who thrusts
himself where he is not welcome), as I wandered around the show at Olympia. I
know that any fool can criticize--I can do it myself--but feel that a few criticisms
will not come amiss. The Fancy press will doubtless ere this appears have published
screeds eulogizing the National, profusely illustrated, as usual, by photos of the
winners, which all too often depict less clearly the beauty of the birds than the plainness
of their owners. Also I gather an appraisal of the Show will appear in the same
issue of the A.M. as this.
Since my role is that of a critic, I will not dwell on the obvious good health of most
of the exhibits or the steadiness of many of them. Still, it would be churlish to make
no mention of the very favourable impression given by many of the British and
foreign softbills in particular. I was especially impressed with the pair of Tree
Pipits and the Lesser Whitethroat, whose beautiful condition in their roomy cages
did much to allay the distaste aroused by some of their competitors.
Now for adverse comments.

(1) A large proportion of the non-domestic (and some of the domestic ones) birds
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9380182" page_id="56291479"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
exhibited were either trying desperately to escape or else squatting on their perches
in that tense defensive posture that tells as surely of nervous stress. It was noticeable
with the British Softbills (among which were two Oriental Black Redstarts !) that
in general the birds in small bare cages were more panicky and restless than those in
larger cages with greenery.
(2) Many birds had broken feathers, or cut their foreheads in their efforts to
escape. Some of the prizewinners had cut foreheads, perhaps done after the judging.
I know how easily such injuries are done in a moment's panicking, and that they
soon heal, but only the most purblind fancier will suggest that a bleeding head peering
from a tiny cage is a good advertisement for bird-keeping.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.678854" page_id="56291479"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
(3) In an aviary with Ornamental Pheasants (mostly mongrels) and Parrakeets,
one of the cock Reeves had badly cut the top of its head (the blood showing up on
the white feathers in a very conspicuous manner), and the Amherst had injured
both head and wing, although the latter looked to be an injury of some standing.
(4) I was surprised to see that a creamy-pink and black Short-billed Minivet
and two blue Green Magpies (Cissa chinensis ) had won high honours. They certainly
looked very fit, but it seems odd to award prizes to birds whose natural colours
have been lost owing to some adverse factors of captive life. Incidentally, I was
informed by a fancier present that if correctly fed Cissas will retain or even regain
their natural green and red colour.
(5) A bird with a deformed bill was awarded third prize. When I saw it (Thursday
and Saturday evenings) it did not look in very good shape, anyway. I suppose as it
was a species seldom kept, one's attitude ought to be that of Dr. Johnson towards
educated women and performing dogs, " The wonder is not that it is badly done,
but that it should be done at all."
(6) The tiny cages that the British Finches and Buntings are staged in are an
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994925384615385" page_id="56291479"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
abomination, although the birds' feet would doubtless keep cleaner if some more
suitable floor covering than seed were used. The layman at the show assumes--
quite naturally since no effort is made to enlighten him--that the birds are per-
manently kept in these wretched cells. I overheard four people commenting loudly
on the cruelty of this, and for everyone who made vocal protest at the Show, it is
probable that there were fifty who kept silent, but will protest more effectively else-
where.
(7) The educational value of the show (about which we often hear a lot talked)
would be much increased if the cages were labelled with both English and scientific
names of the birds, or perhaps only the former, but the scientific name appearing
in the catalogue as was so sensibly done in the case of the reptiles. On my second
visit on Saturday I was pleased to see that at least some of the Foreign and British
birds had been labelled, albeit one or two of them incorrectly.

(8) Fancier's jargon, such as the ridiculous and inapplicable name " Black-
start " for the Black Redstart, should not be used without an explanation. Even
more foolish was the attempt to perpetuate the joke in the A.M. correspondence by
exhibiting Pheasant X Domestic Fowl hybrids as " Phantoms " with no word to explain
to puzzled visitors that these were not some species of bird correctly so named, but
interesting hybrids that had been so dubbed in a light-hearted moment.
In conclusion, I am still of my opinion that bird shows exhibit bird-keeping in an
unfavourable light. But if the British and Foreign birds were all staged in the sort
of quarters the Tree Pipit pair were shown in. If measures were taken to inform the
public that the birds were not normally closely confined. If the cages were named
and labelled, correctly. If some facilities were given in the Show cages to enable
hole-roosting birds such as Tits to spend a comfortable night, and if the cages, whilst
in full view, could be so placed that the public could not--as I saw many doing--
poke, and shake, or cough, pant, and smoke over the birds, then, and only then,
bird-shows might do more good than harm to aviculture.

PHANTOMS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.985579424242424" page_id="56291480"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
I was indeed very interested in Mr. F. E. Thomas's letter.
Perhaps I ought to have put more exclamation marks after my remark about
being the first to breed " Phantoms " because, of course, I did not seriously claim to
be the first person to cross a Pheasant with a Bantam, as I was aware that this had
been done before.
What particularly interested me in Mr. Thomas's letter, however, was that his
hybrids and the chick that was hatched here should have had the same parentage
except that in our case the sexes of the parents were reversed--cock Golden Pheasant
X hen Sebright Bantam. It seems curious that (assuming, of course, that
Mr. Thomas's hybrids are males) the most georgeous of the pheasants mated to one
of the prettiest of the bantams should produce offspring " rather uninteresting to the
eye, the colour being a dull brownish-black ", and it makes one wonder whether
the cross--but bred the other way round--with a cock Golden Pheasant as one of
the parents, might not be considerably brighter. Somehow I rather fancy it would,
but I have never tried the experiment of breeding the same hybrids both ways as
it were with any species of birds, and it would be interesting to hear from someone
who has, whether the progeny in each case look alike.
Incidentally it would seem that it is easier for a male Bantam to mate with a female
Pheasant than vice versa, as the brief and snowy encounter of Mr. Thomas's escapee
cock Sebright Bantam and hen Golden Pheasant resulted in two hybrids, whereas
the two years my cock Golden Pheasant has spent with his three Bantam wives has
produced, besides dozens of infertile eggs, only two fertile ones, one of which hatched
but died, the other being dead in the shell.
While my cock Golden Pheasant was very devoted and attentive to his Bantam
hens, I doubt if they ever really took him seriously as a husband, since he was such a
vainglorious, gaudy mountebank of a fellow--and they were such typical suburban
housewives !
It was amusing to see with what trepidation--and keeping close together--they
would sally forth to feed at the same food dish, and then their look of unutterable
boredom when the Pheasant--green-gold eyes blazing lecherously and black and
orange cape spread to the full--suddenly rushed out at them from a bamboo thicket
and proceeded to hiss at them and tear round them in ever narrowing circles. They
were clearly shocked at such unbantamlike behaviour ; they became giddy ; and

finally, when they could bear it no longer, they jumped cackling out of the magic
circle and, still clucking their disapproval, hurriedly took refuge on the highest perch
in the shelter !

I did not know that the above-mentioned hybrid was anything new, as the cross
between pheasants and fowls has been known a very long time. It is over thirty years
since I bred one from a Game Bantam hen and a Golden Pheasant cock. The most
astonishing hybrid I have ever heard of is the one reported from the Continent.
This is a Swinhoe cock Tragopan hen hybrid. I had always regarded Tragopans
as being gorgeous Partridges. They differ entirely from Pheasants in their short
tails, spotted plumage, diet, and especially in their sexual display. I believe the latter
is quite unique amongst birds. Another wide cross is that between an Impeyan cock
and a common fowl hen, which I saw at Cleres.

TURQUOISINE PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956255583333333" page_id="56291481"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
According to Mr. West's description of the Turquoisines he has in California,
they would appear to differ in several respects from normal Turquoisines as we know
them in Europe, and I think it is important for the sake of intending purchasers of
these parrakeets that the differences should be pointed out :
Firstly. Normal hen Turquoisines do not have red wing patches, smaller but no
less bright than those of the cock. Their wings are simply green and blue, with
no red patch.
Secondly. Normal young cock Turquoisines do not leave the nest with red wing
patches. What they do have is a very faint brownish tinge where the wing patches
(which are chestnut-maroon rather than red) will later appear, and the former are
not easy to see unless the bird is looked at in strong sunlight.
Thirdly. Normal adult cock Turquoisines do not have brilliant yellow-orange
breasts. The colour is pure lemon-yellow, some of the feathers on the upper breast
being tipped with green. This, however, is a variable feature, some specimens having
almost the whole of the breast yellow, while in others the admixture of green on the
upper breast is very marked.

THE CATCHING OF CONGO PEACOCKS
I write to draw attention to the miserable tale of destruction of Congo Peacocks
by Charles Cordier, U.S.A., in the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine. In all
the years I have been a member of the society I cannot remember anything of such
an unpleasant nature. This is the revolting tale of the unhappy fate of 16 to 17 birds
besides a brood of chicks whose parent died. The final " achievement " of taking
six males and one old female to America is totally eclipsed by the damage done in
killing so many females. The article has not even the merit of containing more than
sketchy details of the natural history of the species. I feel sure that many members
must also abhor not only the article but the methods adopted by this man in his
attempt to capture Congo Peacocks.
Few aviculturists would want to keep rare birds or indeed any birds if it were
known that the price of obtaining the odd specimen meant the destruction of large
numbers in an inhuman manner. I can only imagine that the repetition of such
articles in the Magazine will arouse indignation, bring discredit to our society, and
rightfully attract the attention of the protection societies to the unwarranted cruelty
adopted by some individuals in collecting live birds.

The grief on the death of a Sovereign, who had
made himself so much at one with his people that
his passing was felt as a personal loss by all his
loyal subjects, was not confined to the British
Commonwealth alone, but was shared in full
measure by that great nation the United States
of America. The universal admiration for His late
Majesty, George VI, who was not only a great
King but a great man--by his example of high
ideals, unwavering courage, human sympathy and
understanding--was universal, and as sincerely felt
by countries overseas as in his own island home.
Even in his death our gracious and beloved King
continued to serve humanity, for their common
sorrow has drawn the British Commonwealth of
Nations and their American cousins even more
closely together.

NOTES ON SOME BIRDS OF THE BRITISH
CAMEROONS FOREST

By John Yealland (London, England)
During the winter of 1947-48 I went with my friend, Gerald
Durrell, to the British Cameroons in order to make a collection of
birds, mammals, and reptiles and some notes on the birds seen en route
and during our stay of several months may be of a little general
interest.
We sailed from Liverpool and in St. George's Channel two Starlings
passed over the ship. They appeared to be undergoing an involuntary
migration from Ireland, for they were being carried along by a fairly
strong north-westerly gale and seemed, as they passed by, to be
striving to alight in the rigging, but were powerless to do so and
were soon swept out of sight in a south-easterly direction.
The night we were passing through the Bay of Biscay, or actually
just outside it, a Storm Petrel flew into the bo'sun's cabin, the first
that either he or any of the officers had known to do this.
It seemed rather weak from exhaustion, so we took it to our cabin
and, feeling that our prestige on board was at stake, decided to try
to feed it, so asked the steward for a little raw meat, whereupon he,
being accustomed to the realm of plenty and regardless of the size of
this tiny Petrel, brought a large plate of steak. The bird, very
unwillingly, swallowed a few small shreds of this and by evening it
had brightened considerably.
None of the crew knew this bird, but when they were told its name
they predicted some rough weather, and they were certainly right,
for that night a severe gale blew up and the ship pitched and rolled
to the accompaniment of much crashing of crockery below.
The little bird remained sitting in the bottom of the waste paper
basket and did not attempt to escape. The next morning, off Cape
Finnisterre, we released the Petrel after taking a few photographs of it.
It was loth to go and seemed anxious to creep into some dark place,
such as under my jacket. It was quite unafraid of us and it was only
when we put it on the rail and it tottered over the edge that it took
flight and was quickly lost to view.
It seems miraculous that these apparently frail birds can live at sea,
generally in the roughest weather, but no doubt part of the explanation
is that they do not strive against the wind but glide rather than fly,
taking advantage of every current of air.
Few other sea-birds were seen even round about the Canary Islands,
between which we passed ; one or two of the birds looked in the
distance like Gannets in the immature plumage and there were a few
of what appeared to be a species of Skua as well as two species of
small gull, both pretty and graceful birds.

The flying fish were interesting to watch, and in these days when
fish are exhibited at cage-bird shows, a note on them from my diary
might not be seriously out of place.
" During the morning we had an excellent view of a number of
flying fish, some of them quite small--less than 4 inches--and others,
possibly of another species, up to 8 inches.
"We saw quite clearly the method of the flight : the fish rises
from the water and glides at a considerable speed not far from the
surface and with only a gradual loss of height, and if it desires to
continue to glide further when it has gone down to within an inch
or two of the surface it dips its tail into the water and by rapid lateral
movements of it together with quick beats of the large pectoral fins
it regains its impetus. One glided some 50 yards, in the course of
which it dipped its tail once. Sometimes they glide in a direct line
and sometimes they turn into the wind."
At last, in the early morning mist, we saw some rocky islets in the
bay at Bota, near Victoria, and as the mist cleared we caught sight
of the coast--a beautiful sight with the vivid greens of the palms, trees,
and other foliage.
Very soon a ramshackle canoe came towards the ship, and when
the anchor had been dropped it came alongside, one occupant baling
out the water at frequent intervals while the other paddled.
They had in a small cage a Blue-billed Seed-cracker [Spermophaga
hamatina pustulata) which they hoped to exchange for a shirt. A few
Vulturine Fishing Eagles ( Gy pokier ax angolensis) flew near the ship ;
these seem to be common on the coast and even far inland, wherever
there are rivers one sees a few. I was brought two, one of them still
in the brown immature plumage, at Kumba, some sixty miles inland
which the bringer said he had caught while they were fighting on the
ground. These readily ate fish, but later, when for some reason the
fish supply failed for a few days, they ate raw meat, and thereafter
had no taste for fish, sometimes eating none at all for a day. On these
occasions, when the following morning the cage trays were cleaned,
the very soiled and stale fish were retrieved from the rubbish by the
native carpenter and wrapped in a piece of banana leaf for his own
consumption, but he thrived on them and never suffered from ptomaine
poisoning.
A conspicuous bird walking sedately about the grass in Victoria
was the Buff-backed or Cattle Heron ( Bubulcus i. ibis).
These birds are naturally tame and show considerable intelligence
in their search for food, walking about round the feet of any of the
grazing hump-backed cattle or goats, or standing at a respectful
distance from the natives engaged in cutting grass so as to catch the
disturbed grasshoppers.
No town or village is without the African Black Kite ( Milvus Migrans

parasitus), a scavenging bird, which is always circling in search of the
stray chicken or other food.
Early the next morning I saw a flock of Orange-cheeked Waxbills
feeding on the tiny seeds of a species of grass which grows in any
open space. One expects to see few and rather common birds so near
a town but when, later in the day, we went to some rather neglected
plantations at the back of the Rest House, there was such a great
variety of birds that I was glad of Bates' Handbook of the Birds of West
Africa , which Mr. Peter Scott had kindly given me--as, indeed, I was
on many future occasions.
It should be mentioned here that the common names used in this
article are those of Bates and the scientific ones those of Sclater.
Among the birds identified with certainty at this place within an
hour or two were a small flock of Black-headed Waxbills ( Estrilda
atricapilla) , a Senegal Goucal ( Centropus s. senegalensis) , some Black-
crowned Bee-eaters (Merops albicollis ), a single Cameroon Goly ( Colius
striatus nigricollis) which seemed to be alone, for I did not see or hear
any others, a Didric Cuckoo ( Chrysococcyx caprius), some Pied Grows
(Corvus albus ), a bird quite as cunning and hard to catch as its much
more persecuted European relatives, and, standing in the stony bed
of a shallow stream, an African Open-bill ( Anastomus l. lamelligerus ).
A Sacred Ibis ( Threskiornis aethiopicus aethiopicus) flew over ; some
weeks later I saw one of these in company with a Buff-backed Heron
far inland and evidently on their northward migration.
One or two Common Sandpipers were seen and there were, of
course, many Weaver-birds, one of which appeared to be Vieillot's
Black Weaver ( Ploceus nigerrimus ), the males of which are very
conspicuous with their wholly black plumage and bright yellow irides.
The Village Weaver or Palm-bird (. Ploceus c. cucullatus) is another
common one, while round about the Rest House and, indeed, about
any of the villages, the most noticeable bird was the Gaboon Bulbul--
I believe the sub-species Pycnonotus barbatus nigeria, for I did not see
one with more than the faintest tinge of yellow on the under tail-coverts.
These birds possess a certain insolent charm and they were always the
first to sing in the early dawn--a discordant inconsequential song.
I believe they would prove an entertaining semi-liberty bird in this
country, though destructive to soft fruits.
The pretty Blue-spotted Dove ( Turtur a. afer) was often seen, always
a pair together, picking about on the gravel paths.
On a flowering bush near the Rest House dining room a Sunbird
came to feed ; I believe it was Reichenbach's (Anabathmis reichenbachi ),
and the only one I ever saw.
In a palm plantation near Victoria the only birds seen were a small
flock of Grey-breasted Waxbills ( Estrilda n. nonnula), a bird not seen
elsewhere. There were, of course, many Swifts, Martins, and Swallows

but even with field glasses it was very difficult to identify them. One
species was nesting in January, the large untidy nests being built
(mostly of a kind of thistledown) on the beams of the roof of a store
close up under the corrugated iron roof, which must have been a very
hot situation in the midday sun.
Two quite common Kingfishers were the Blue-breasted (Halcyon m.
malimbica ) and the Pigmy (Ispidina p. picta ), both grasshopper feeders.
I was from time to time brought several of the Pigmy Kingfishers, but
always had to let them go because in that lean year I was not able
to take mealworms with me and found that the birds would not eat
raw meat though they would, of course, eat grasshoppers, a food
I could not hope to supply on the homeward voyage.
At length, however, I was brought a black-billed fledgling, which
readily took small pieces of raw meat offered to it on a pair of
tweezers. Before leaving I dried a small mepachrine bottle full of
grasshoppers for use on the voyage, for I feared that without this
roughage and means of making pellets the little bird would not
survive the fifteen days' voyage ; but the first night while the ship
was still at Tiko and swarming with natives engaged in loading
bananas, the bottle disappeared having, I believe, been stolen by one
of them who thought it contained quinine. His dismay could not
have been greater than mine for the ship was not, as we had been
told, infested with cockroaches, but the Kingfisher did not mind the
meat diet and was safely landed here.
At Kumba, where we were delayed for several weeks on our way
back to the coast owing to shipping difficulties, suitable nesting places
for these Kingfishers were evidently scarce, for a pair made a burrow
in the side of the pit that was our primitive lavatory. This undesirable
residence was completed in a very few days, and when we came away
tlie mother was sitting.
Two of the Blue-breasted were brought back ; these birds seemed
to have regular feeding rounds, and one which came every evening
just before dusk was easily caught in a trap baited with a grasshopper
and placed near its accustomed perch.
After a few days' stay in Victoria we left for Mamfe, some 180 miles
to the northward, a journey which took two days by lorry over a fair
road, part of which had been made only since the war. The road
winds through quite mountainous country, but it was not often, owing
to the dense jungle, that one could catch a glimpse of the scenery.
Mamfe itself is in quite open country, standing some 150 feet above
the Cross River and having a well-kept golf course on which some
Yellow Wagtails and a few Whinchats were seen.
The river was, of course, low at that time of the year, but it was
evident from the great sandbanks on either side what a torrent must
rush down there in the rains.

A conspicuous bird on the sandbanks was the White-headed
Plover ( Xiphidiopterus albiceps), a rather tame bird which could be
approached to within 80 yards. One afternoon we went by canoe up
the river between the high rocky sides of the Mainyu Gorge, and on
the roof of a small cave saw the mud nests of presumably two species
of Martin or Swallow, one having a tubular entrance and the other
being oval. There were some Sandbank Pratincoles ( Glareola cinerea),
some young Long-tailed Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax a. africanus ), and
a pair of Pied Kingfishers ( Ceryle r. rudis).
On the way back three of a party of five Hippopotami swam
towards us, but their timidity overcame their curiosity and they did
not venture very near.
The next day, from the top of the gorge I watched a Giant Kingfisher
(&lt;Ceryle m. maxima). It dived with a great splash but failed to get a fish.
While we were at Mamfe, Dr. Serle, whose work on the British
Cameroon birds will be known to many, kindly sent me two nestlings
of this species. They throve and grew rapidly while I was able to
provide them with fish or raw meat, but later, at the small village of
Bakebe, 25 miles from Mamfe, the fish supply was uncertain and there
came a day when the only food for the birds was the flesh of Muscovy
Duck, which made them both ill and caused the death of one ; the
other died two weeks later when the only available food for a day was
tadpoles. It was a great disappointment to lose these two birds which
would have been so easy to rear under ordinary conditions with
a regular supply of small fish. From the top of the gorge I also saw
two Blue Plantain-eaters ( Corythteola cristata) and later saw others (as
many as seven together), and although they were nesting early in the
year no native ever found a nest for me. As these birds seemed always
to live in the highest trees there was little hope of catching any.
Near the Rest House at Mamfe, where we stayed for a few days,
there grew a Bombax tree which was in bloom, and as the leaves
had not yet unfolded it was easy to see the birds which came presumably
to feed on the insects which the flowers attracted, for there seemed
little nectar in them. It was difficult to get a good view of the birds
for they were so constantly on the move, but some were obviously
Sunbirds--one or more of the brown-bodied ones of the genus Cinnyris
and others appeared to be the Superb (C. i - . superbus).
Each day at almost precisely noon a pair and a young male Olive-
bellied Sunbirds (C. chloropygius luhderi) came in search of insects to
a hibiscus hedge which grew close by the Rest House.
The birds seemed to have a regular round for they never came
before or after noon, and at another place I saw a pair only in the
early morning coming to feed on the newly-opened flowers of a
creeper and never coming, so far as I knew, later in the day.
I brought back a nest of this species, a tiny pendulous structure.

The native boys have two methods of catching birds : one is by
means of bird-lime made from the white sap of a kind of liana and
the other by the use of an ingeniously contrived snare made from
a thin springy stick and a noose made from fine strips of banana bark
plaited together. The noose is laid over a thin stick on which the
bird alights in order to reach the bait, which is generally palm-nuts,
termites, flowers, or a small bunch of bright red berries, and in so
doing springs the trap and is caught by the legs.
I fixed a few of the fallen Bombax flowers (which are rather tulip-
like in shape and of a bright salmon pink) on the hibiscus hedge and
put a little honey in them. The Sunbirds quickly found this and drank
from the flowers but were not induced to stay any longer or to come
more often. A boy made me one of the noose traps and I took away
all but one of the flowers which was placed near the fateful perch.
It was difficult to set the trap lightly enough for such small birds,
but evidently it was, for the hen was soon caught. The others did not
return for some time, but eventually they did but were very suspicious
and would not go near the trap, and during the next two days that
we were there they did not come back. The Bombax tree itself was
not a happy hunting ground for the thinner branches were covered
with strong cruel thorns.
I went back to Bakebe, on the Victoria side of Mamfe, which
seemed a good place for birds, while Durrell went to Eshobi, a village
at which Sanderson in 1932 made a part of a great collection of
mammal and reptile specimens for the British Museum, including the
Angwantibo ( Arctocebus calabarensis) , of which we eventually obtained
three, one of them being the first to be exhibited in the London Zoo.
The jungle round about Bakebe was full of birds ; they could be
heard everywhere though it was always difficult to see more than
a few and the best chance of doing so was by waiting in the beds of
dried up streams and watching as they came to drink or to bathe in
the few remaining pools.
Some came to bathe just before dusk, and though it was difficult
in the dim light to identify them one could be recognized as the
Gaboon Forest Robin ( Stiphrornis erythrothorax gabonensis). This sub-
species, of which I brought two, was not uncommon, but I never saw
the yellow-bellied one (S. c. xanthogaster ).
Another fairly common bird was the Blue-shouldered Robin Ghat
(Cossypha cyanocampter) , but another, the White-browed (C. polioptera
nigriceps) was quite rare and I saw only three, two of them already dead
when brought to me and the third I kept for some four months.
A brown Babbler which I never identified to my satisfaction but
which seemed to be Phyllanthus atripennis haynesi , was an apparently
rare bird. I obtained one and some weeks later a boy brought
another, and the joy of the first on seeing another of its own kind

was quite touching to witness. I put them together and they sat side
by side murmuring with every sign of contentment. Both died on the
voyage and both were affected by some trematode-like parasite, not
in the intestines but living in the body cavity.
Only once did I see them in the forest when a party of about six
passed by hunting for food and calling to one another as they went,
as is their roving habit.
A boy once brought me a Mountain Wagtail ( Motacilla clara ),
together with its nest containing a very young family, and I felt so
conscience-stricken about it that I let the mother go, for one could
not trust the natives to replace a nest and liberate the parent near by.
Bates, who seems to have been ruthless, writes of this dainty bird :
" It is a real water-sprite, living in the spray and making its keen
voice heard above the din of waterfalls, often frustrating the bird-
collector's murderous designs (to his secret contentment, however) by
keeping itself over places from which it could never be recovered if
shot."
The White-tailed Ekwalat (Neocossyphus p. poensis) was not uncommon
nor was the Fire-crest Alethe ( Alethe c. castanea).
An interesting variety of birds was caught by the native boys in
snares baited with the bright red berries of a small tree which grows
commonly about the villages. The berries hang in clusters and are
encased in a green fleshy husk which drops off as they ripen. A small
amount of rather tasteless flesh surrounds the large seed which is
regurgitated by the birds. At least three species of Sunbirds eat these
berries--the Blue-throated Brown ( Cinnyris cyanolcemus) , the Collared
(Anthreptes collaris hypodila ), and the Grey-chinned (A. tephrolama) and
three species of Tinker-birds--the Speckled ( Pogoniulus scolopaceus
flavisquamatus) , the Red-rumped [P. erythronotus) , and the Least (P. s.
sub sulphureus) . This last is very like the Lemon-rumped, which I never
saw, but decidedly smaller.
The Barbets caught in this way were the Bristle-nosed ( Gymnobucco
peli), the Yellow-spotted ( Buccanodon duchaillui), and the Yellow-billed
( TrachyUmus p. purpuratus) and of the Bulbuls, the Gaboon, the
Spotted ( Ixonotus guttatus ), the Icterine ( Phyllastrephus i. icterinus ), and
Pyrrhurus simplex. I was once brought one of the curious Bristle-necks
( Trichophorus chloronotus) which had been caught in a trap baited with
these berries. Many birds feed on the oily husk of the palm-nuts and
are caught in snares baited with them. The Blue-billed Malimbus,
(Malimbus n. nitens ), normally insectivorous, is one. I was brought
several at different times, but though there was never any difficulty
in getting them to eat quantities of grasshoppers, the oily larvae of the
palm weevil, palm-nut husk, and fruit, all became thin and none
lived more than a fortnight.
The Negro Finches were others caught by this bait, and the plumage

of Nigrita canicapilla is sometimes stained yellow by the palm oil.
I brought back one of these and one N. bicolor brunescens and was
once brought a J\f. 1 . luteifrons which unfortunately had a broken leg.
Orange-cheeked and Black-headed Waxbills and sometimes Bronze
Manikins are also caught by this means.
Among the birds said by the natives to have been caught with
termites as the bait were Latham's Francolin ( Francolinus l. lathami ),
of which I was brought several, all of them with badly injured legs
caused by their struggles in the snare and from which none recovered.
Tambourine Doves ( Tympanistria t. fraseri ), the Blue-spotted and a
single Aplopelia simplex plumbescens were also said to have been caught
in this way.
Another method is to catch sleeping birds. Native hunters some-
times go out at night armed with a primitive gun and one having
fixed on his head an old acetylene miner's lamp procured, no doubt,
from the coal-mining district near Port Harcourt.
The game is any suitable animal and the method is sheer murder
for Duiker and Antelope which generally run to the nearest cover
where they stand and look towards the light, so that the hunter has
only to shoot at the retinal reflection of their eyes.
Not all birds sleep soundly enough to be caught in this way and
the ones I was brought--generally late the next morning--were the
Forest Robins, Blue-shouldered Robin Ghats, and Pigmy King-
fishers--and once two lovely Wattle-eyes, the Red-cheeked (Diaphoro-
phia b. blissetti) with turquoise blue wattles, but alas, they were far
gone and did not survive.
One morning I was brought a Pitta {Pitta angolensis pulih) which
the hunter said he had caught during the night, but it had a broken
wing. The catcher must, of course, remain behind the light and
approach the bird quietly.
I went out twice, and on the first occasion caught a Flycatcher
{Tchitrea melampyra batesi ) which was roosting on the end of a thin
dead twig and was easily caught with a butterfly net. I had this
pretty bird for about three months. On the second excursion nothing
was seen and on neither occasion was an animal seen though some
were heard.
The natives had no conception of handling birds with care, often
bringing them some hours after they had been caught. Whenever an
obviously dying bird was pointed out to the bringer he always insisted
that it would not die. Once a woman brought a Guineafowl in a
primitive cage, and while she was assuring me that it could not
possibly die it expired on the floor. Quite unabashed, she picked up
the bird and walked off to sell it to the cook. I brought three Guinea-
fowl ; they were Guttera edouardi sclateri and all had, I believe, been
caught at night while sitting on their eggs. Only once did I hear the

wild and (as Guineafowl go) not unmusical cry of this handsome bird
in the forest.
The only Parrots seen were the Grey and these generally at dawn
or dusk when they were flying swiftly over, presumably to or from
their roosting places. It is sometimes almost dark when one hears
their alternate squawk and whistle, and once I heard two flying over
in the middle of the night.
One sometimes sees a few feeding in some tree of which the fruits
or seeds are ripe, and then they remain very silent, but can be located
by the shower of discarded food, etc., falling to the ground. These
birds must eat a great variety of food in the wild state. Hornbills
are quite often seen : the Yellow-casque ( Ceratogymna elata), the White-
crested ( Tropicranus albocristatus cassini ), and the Laughing ( Bycanistes
s. sharpii ) are common ones.
I brought several, all of them young and presumably caught before
they could fly well after leaving the nest, including one which I thought
to be the Brown-cheeked Miam (. Bycanistes cylindricus) , but I have not
seen the bird since, if still living, it has acquired the adult plumage.
I once found a Hornbill's nest some 40 feet from the ground. The
sealed up hole in the tree was so well done as to be almost impossible
to detect, and it was only the clamour made by the mother or young
one when the male came with food that drew my attention to it.
Judging the young one to be almost ready to come out, a village man
with a reputation as a climber of trees was negotiated with, and
thinking that the vision of capturing the mother and several young
ones with the appropriate rich reward would sustain him in the course
of his climb, no mention was made of the fact that he would find no
more than the mother and one young bird. The next day he set off
with a boy to guide him to the place, but was soon back to say that
the tree was " past " him.
I saw two species of Whydahs : the Pin-tailed on a few occasions,
always in the company of Orange-cheeked Waxbills and never more
ihan two together. I once saw a male in full plumage performing its
display flight, a dancing gnat-like flight, though its mate was not to
be seen anywhere near. Twice I saw a single male of one or other of
the yellow-shouldered ones flying in a rather laboured way across an
open space, a striking target, one would think for a bird of prey.
When Durrell returned from Eshobi he brought what were perhaps
the most interesting birds I brought back--three of the White-spotted
Pigmy Rails (Sarothrura pulchra zenkeri).
These delightful little birds soon became fairly tame ; I used to
put crumbled decayed palm fibre on the tray of their cage for the
sake of their feet and immediately they carried some of it into a corner
and made a little nest or platform with it.
This performance went on every morning, and I wonder whether

it is their habit to make roosting platforms in the wild state. I did
not catch any of these with limed mid-ribs of palm leaves placed
around the pools in a dried up stream at Bakebe but saw footmarks
of what might have been this bird and caught one of the Grey-throated
Rails ( Caniralius ocullus batesi) ; also a Black Crake ( Limnocorax
fiavirostra) and a White-bellied Kingfisher (Alcedo leucogaster batesi)
which is largely a tadpole eater.
A little later Durrell went to the mountain of N'dali, some six miles
from Bakebe. It was a wild uninhabited place and slightly sacred as
we learned later when the local chiefs made a protest to the Divisional
Officer. With fieldglasses it was easy to see its most precipitous side
towering above the surrounding forest and I wondered whether the
rocky base might be a home for Picathartes, though from Bates it
seemed that this place was too far inland, but from what is now
known it is a likely habitat and I regret never having time to go there.
The only interesting birds sent down from this mountain were three
Ground Thrushes ( Geokichla camerunensis) , all of which I unluckily lost
from aspergillosis.
I was brought a Red-necked Buzzard ( Buteo auguralis), the only one
I saw, by a native who said he found it with its feet entangled in long
grass. He asked five pounds for it, but as I did not want it, I offered
two shillings. He pondered this dismal proposition for more than an
hour, but finally accepted. The only possible value of a bird to
these people is that of food, so the commonest Francolin is worth
more to them than a Picathartes.
Their normal diet is so deficient in animal protein that they eat
the smallest birds, and the only things I have ever seen them liberate
were bats and chameleons.
I was also brought one of the lovely pale grey Lizard Buzzards
(Kaupifalco m. monogrammicus) and a young Black Sparrow Hawk
(.Accipter melanoleucus temmincki) which the bringer said he caught when
it was attacking his chickens. Two species of the local grasshoppers,
one black and yellow and the other, a much larger one, black, yellow,
and dull emerald green were evidently unpalatable to birds. The
larger one was very sluggish in its movements as if aware of its
immunity. No bird would touch them and I once offered some to
one of the local chickens which will eat almost anything, but even it
turned aside.
One night at Bakebe we were roused by the night-watchman who,
by some lucky chance, was awake at his post. An invasion of driver
ants, which we had always dreaded, was taking place, and one column
was already coming into the hut while the main one was passing along
near the front of it. We hastily poured down disinfectant around the
crates and cages and then with the help of the staff set about attacking
the ants outside with burning torches of dry palm fronds. It was a

long struggle and we were well bitten, but we finally routed the ants
and saved our specimens. It was still dark when the battle came to
an end, and while we were waiting for some well-earned tea a Blue-
shouldered Robin Ghat sang a few soft sweet notes such as I had
sometimes before heard it do during the night. The whole experience
was remindful of the air-raids of war-time nights, but no " Raiders
Passed " signal was sweeter music than that of the Robin Ghat.
The driver ants sometimes hunt by day, and when a column is
crossing a path the soldiers stand on either side of it with their great
jaws pointing upwards but in more open country they generally
spread out in search of food and can sometimes be located by the
presence of the birds which gather round in the hope of catching the
unhappy insects fleeing for their lives. There is something uncanny
about these ants and the realization that if for any reason one could
not move out of the way of this shiny black and swiftly moving horde
one would be eaten alive.
After a time we moved down to Kumba, where a common bird
was the Kurrichane Thrush ( Turdus libonyanus saturatus ), which sang
a beautiful song not unlike that of the Song Thrush.
The bird-life here was very like that of the forest further inland,
though I was brought three new Sunbirds--the Superb, the Gheerick
(Cinnyris veriicalis cyanocephalus) , and the Green-throated (C. a. ango -
lensis) ; also a Narrow-tailed Starling ( Poeoptera l. lugubris) which was
almost dead.
Two species of Woodpecker were the only ones seen. One of them,
the Pigmy ( Verrauxia africana ), was brought from Eshobi and lived for
two months on tree termites, its natural food, but it became rather fat
and died suddenly. The other was a dead Green-backed Barred
( Campethera p. permista), a very pretty bird.
From the crater lake of Barombi I was brought two Kingfishers--
a Pied and a Shining Blue ( Alcedo quadribrachys guentheri) , but evidently
they were bad travellers, for they were ill on arrival and did not
survive for more than a few days, though an African Little Grebe
( Podiceps ruficollis capensis) which came with them lived happily for
several weeks until I liberated it in a nearby steam, for it was very
like the well-known Little Grebe and of no especial interest.
A nice bird brought to me at Kumba was a Black-throated Goucal
(Centropus l. leucogaster) , together with one small white egg which, so
the bringer said, was being incubated by the bird when he caught it.
This Goucal became quite tame and I found it to be fond of snails,
which helped to solve the feeding problem here where mice and other
foods were not easy to get and the bird did not like whale meat.
The Spectacled Flycatcher ( Platysteira c. cyanea) was not uncommon
about the villages ; I kept one for about six weeks, but let it go when
it began to lose condition.

I also kept a Black-crowned Bee-eater on meat and grasshoppers
for nearly three months, liberating it soon after the others had gone
northwards on migration, for it seemed unlikely that it would survive
much longer and there must be little hope of keeping such a bird for
any length of time in a small cage.
The Chestnut-crowned Bush Shrike (Lanarius luhderi) was another
of the victims of aspergillosis which caused me some losses before
I was able to get some potassium iodide, which seemed an effective
preventive of this disease.
Touracos were very rarely seen but often heard, the well-known call
being a stirring sound in the early morning mist of the forest valleys.
A pair of the pretty Grey-headed Sparrows (.Passer g. griseus) lived
round about our hut at Kumba and seemed interested in the eaves of
it as if they were looking for a nesting place.
The rains had already started before we were at last able to leave,
and life during this season must often be difficult for the small birds,
particularly those which are nesting, for the heavy rain is sometimes
accompanied by cold winds of gale force. With the realization that
I had seen a very few of the many Cameroon birds, I have often
wished to go back, though not without much better equipment,
prepared insectile foods in sealed tins, and the humble yet almost
indispensable mealworm.

Members interested in the Australian parrakeets doubtless saw the
Secretary's note of my importation of three pairs of Splendids in the
early spring of last year.
A combination of circumstances prevented me giving the birds out-
door accommodation until almost midsummer. A young pair did not
nest ; one adult hen was lost when close to lay, probably with
pneumonia, but the other pair successfully reared two broods of four
each, six hens and two cocks.
As the recent relaxation of the importation ban should result in the
reappearance here of these birds it may be of interest to record :--
(i) The incubation period is eighteen days. No doubt the period
is similar to that of other members of the genus, of which I have
but small experience, but it is rather surprising that it should be as
long as that of so much larger birds, for example the Pennant.
(ii) When off the nest the hen was frequently seen to tear off

strips of green leaf and tuck them behind the wings and in the rump
feathers, after the manner of lovebirds. I do not think any ever
reached the nest, they fell out immediately the hen flew.
(iii) The second brood, it was getting late in the season but the
hen was adamant and I weak, was reared in a log under cover. The
base of the nest could be kept damp and the old birds fed almost
exclusively on germinated spray millet, chickweed, and quite
amazing quantities of persicaria on the head. Probably it was a
combination of these two facts that saved the brood, and though it
is true that the smallest was not completely strong and was
destroyed, the remaining three were very satisfying.
When the birds arrived it was noticed that one hen had a slight
conjunctivitis. As time went on it did not improve and was presumably
contagious, as a second hen was beginning to show similar signs at the
time the birds were turned out. In the full sunlight of an outdoor
aviary it was immediately obvious that serious trouble existed and
both birds had to be caught up. Treatment with sulphalamide solution
broken down to 5 per cent and standard (6 per cent) sulphacetamide
sodium ointment was carried on for about ten days, when the eyes
were perfectly healthy and normal. There has been no recurrence
of the complaint. It had been intended to treat the eyes twice daily,
but this became erratic if I was not available, and a day may even have
passed without any application.
In breeding the larger Australian parrakeets the almost invariable
experience is to have more cocks than hens to a brood. Most recorded
breeding notes on Grass Parrakeets show an opposite ratio. Does this
indicate that the mortality of the hens is even greater in the wild than
with other parrakeets ?

A. GENERAL.
In spite of certain similarities this little Pintail, whose male has no
breeding plumage, shows less resemblance to our native Pintail than
do certain species of Anas, which lack breeding plumage, to our
Mallard. Not only the individual actions but the whole general
behaviour of this little duck is peculiarly temperamental, even fiery.
In the behaviour of the bird I could find nothing indicative of near
relationship to the Yellow-billed Teal, Nettion jlavirostre, whose colouring
is very similar.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
These correspond exactly to those of D. acuta, except that the drake
of D. spinicauda has a greater tendency to leave off the " geeeee-
geeeee " in the call note and to utter the whistle only, a thing that
Pintails do only when especially highly excited.
G. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.
They are exactly like those of the Pintail, the constant creaking
" inciting 55 that one often hears being, to my ears, exactly alike in
both species. On the other hand, the " decrescendo-call " has more
syllables and is much more like that of the Mallard than that of
D. acuta. It sounds very much like that of Poecilonetta bahamensis.
I can say nothing about the gestures-of-repulsion because my birds
never bred. Perhaps it and the dominance-reaction of the drake are
lacking in the species.
D. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE DRAKE.
i. The General Form of Display.
The drakes display almost all year round and for that purpose
gather in little societies which, however, are different from those of
the Mallard and Pintail in that the birds do not remain still for a

Drakes, swimming around quickly, burp at very short intervals.
The greater the intensity, the quicker the
succession, and the more the " geeeegeeeee "
gives place to the whistling. When my
three drakes were really in the mood for it
anyone knowing only the Mallard display
and trying to guess their number from the
frequency of their whistles would have said
that there were ten times as many drakes as
I actually possessed (Fig. 24).

This, too, follows in quick succession,
distributed irregularly between the more
frequent burping performances. Although
both these behaviours are exactly like
those of D. acuta the general impression of
the social play of D. spinicauda is quite different.
6. Head-up-tail-up.
This is entirely lacking, as well as the turning of the back of the head,
which in D. acuta is associated with it. The special differentiation of
the head feathers of D. spinicauda corresponds to this vital difference.
The feathers on the temples and the upper side of the head are greatly
lengthened and form a hood in the disk-set linked with burping,
described above. This, together with the " snub-nose " and the bill
markings, give this little duck a peculiar and, in spite of its plainness,
a charming appearance (Fig. 29).

These correspond fully to those of D. acuta , except that D. spinicauda

however, a peculiarity of many species of smaller ducks. Perhaps
there is some correlation between the sensitiveness of the feathers and
the fact that smaller birds are very generally less inclined to fight at
close quarters than larger forms, at least in those which are closely
enough related to permit comparison.

<bodyText confidence="0.988330457142857" page_id="56291504"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
Poecilonetta hahamensis (L)
A. GENERAL.
Unlike the females of all the species hitherto described, the Bahama
Duck is not greyish brown and cryptically coloured, but shows very
nearly the same patterning and colouring as the drake, with handsome
rust-red plumage, white cheeks, and blue and red bill, even the
pointed and elongated scapulars and wing coverts are like those of
the drake. The drakes 5 social display has a certain air of " solemnity 55
because the birds swim about very little and always remain stationary
from the initial head-shake to the commencement of their only display
movement. This is a remarkable contrast to the other Pintails,
especially to D. spinicauda which, in other respects, is very similar.
In one point P. hahamensis is the most differentiated of the Pintail
group, that is in the unique and " exaggerated 55 form of its head* up-
tail-up, which, incidentally, is its only display movement.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
The sexes differ less than those of the two Dafila species. The male
has still a soft " g'e, g'e 53 which can be heard only very near by and
which, although there is hardly even a hint of a second syllable,
surely corresponds to the two-syllabled conversation-call of ducklings
and of both sexes of the Mallard. The female, in all its reactions
and calls, is generally like the female of the species of Dafila. It is
interesting that the female's voice is still further differentiated by the
predominance of " rrrr " sounds. Just as in the species of Dafila the
inciting female's successive 4C queg " notes have become a connected
rolling 4 4 arrrr " in the Bahama Duck, this is also the case in the
one-syllabled C# go-away " call. Whereas in Dafila this consists of
separated " queg " sounds, in P. hahamensis it is a soft, but always
continuous, rolling.
G. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.
i. Inciting.
The voice of the Bahama Duck is higher than that of the female of
either species of Pintail but it is, as we have said, more given to
rolling " rrrr " sounds. The inciting is entirely like that of the
Pintails but perhaps more continuously rolling.

This is exactly like that of the Pintails and, as with D. acuta , very easily
released, as I know full well, although my P. bahamensis have never
bred, and therefore the proper physiological reasons for this did not
exist. The upward bending of the upper mandible is very striking
because of its bright colour, and so also, because of their drake-like
stretched-out pointed form, is the ruffling of the feathers.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966496764705883" page_id="56291505"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
The interest of the female of P. bahamensis in the social display of
the drakes is very great. The gasping reaction that Mallards use so
rarely that I hesitate to include it in the list of their normal reactions,
is, in the Bahama Duck, one of the usual courtship notes of the duck.
It is ordinarily uttered at the moment when drakes perform their
almost voiceless display. It is sharper and more audible than in the
Mallard or domestic duck, but it is almost like them in rhythm,
a three-syllabled sharp gasping " chaechaechae ". This participation
of the ducks in the social-play of the drakes reminds one very much
of the Garganey Teals, and one would take it as a coincidence only
were it not that the African Red-billed Duck, the female of which,
unfortunately, I do not know, forms such a very clear connecting link
between the Bahama Duck and the true Garganeys. In the face of
this fact the gasping of the Bahama Duck holds special taxonomic
significance.
5. Bridling and Nod-Swimming.

2. The Introductory Shaking.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991510882352941" page_id="56291506"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">
Like the Mallard drake, the Bahama drake needs a relatively long
time of self-stimulation, through introductory shaking, in order to
work himself up to the performance of his highly differentiated
display. The shaking is performed only when drakes have solemnly
drawn close to each other and are standing still. If the duck they
are courting swims away from them they are forced to change the
position of their social-play. Then they have to begin again to shake
ceremoniously before they can perform their pretty head-up-tail-up.
This ceremony is a sharp contrast to the Pintails, especially D.
spinicauda. The introductory shaking often lifts the drake right out
of the water, as is the case in the Mallard. During such hard shaking
those who know ducks would expect the grunt-whistle in the course
of the stimulus, as at this level of intensity the behaviour already
approaches it in its outward form. One thinks that the little drake
will have to grunt-whistle the next moment. Instead, however, this
highly intensive shaking is always followed by the head-up-tail-up.
A burp is only possible after less intensive preparatory shaking.

3. Burping.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937740545454546" page_id="56291506"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">
The burping behaviour is entirely like that of the various species of
Dafila. The sound is softer and more like a song-bird than the latter
and is perhaps expressed in letters better by " hiiihiii " than " geeee-
geeee ". A whistle is audible only at
high intensity levels. As with the
Pintail, only perhaps more decidedly,
the " burp " is used by the Bahama
drake for the personal courtship of a
definite female, frequently alternating
with the " head-turning ".
4. Head-up-tail-up.
After highly intensive shaking, as
described, the drake suddenly lifts up
his tail and places it so far forward that
it is over his head, which has been
drawn in and pressed upon the front
part of his back, almost horizontal.
At the same time the elbows as well as
the back and rump feathers remain
pressed tight. The first, however, have to move right over to one
side to give room for the tail, and always both to the same side, so
that the tail is never brought between the wings (see Fig. 25).
As a result the bright rust-coloured under-tail-coverts, which have
been well ruffled in this action, are very striking. The drake stays

at the peak of the act for about three-quarters of a second, during
which he keeps this tipped forward position by stamping backwards
with his oars. Afterwards he sinks back into a normal position ;
there follows a " burp ", like that which D. acuta uses in the
corresponding state, usually pointing the bill directly at the
female. In contrast to the drakes of the Mallard, Pintail, and
Chestnut Duck, the Bahama drake, in this over-emphasized " head-up-
tail-up ", utters a very soft " i-hieh,
i-hieh, i-hieh ", that in rhythm reminds
one very much of the " gasping " of the
Mallard drake and the female P.
bahamensis. The " i-hieh " in the middle is
replaced by a whistle at high intensities.

This is entirely similar to that of D. acuta
(above). Seen from the back the white
cheeks are very striking. These do not
protrude so much in swimming with the
head drawn in without previous display,
and it seems to me that the feathers of the cheeks become more ruffled
than those of the rest of the head (Fig. 26).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970035210526316" page_id="56291507"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
This begins by taking the crouching position, characteristic of D. acuta ,
with indrawn and ruffled head. This, from a reaction arising from
an intention movement of grasping the opponent, has departed so far
from its phylogenetic origin that it never, in the Bahama drake,
proceeds to a grasping of the opponent with the bill. Rather, the bill
is opened very wide in a threatening manner only, in which its striking
red-blue inside becomes significant. In this position the drake chases
his opponent, swimming furiously just beyond, so that both opponents
are alongside each other, whereupon in full sail they treat each other
to whole broadsides of blows with the wing joints, which sound like
the firing of miniature machine guns. This method of fighting
corresponds entirely to that of Lampronessa. It is interesting to note
that in Aix this action has been reduced to a display ceremony which
no longer ends in victory or even in intimidation of the enemy. In
P. bahamensis , however, it is a fully effective mechanism, and the little
drakes, shooting ahead like torpedo-boats, often succeed in putting
much larger enemies to flight.

sequent nod-swimming, instead of which it is followed by repeated

X. THE AFRICAN RED-BILLED DUCK
Poecilonetta erythrorhyncha (Vieillot)
A. GENERAL.
Unfortunately I know only one drake of this species, though for
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.955722466666667" page_id="56291508"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
many years and in the best of health. The African Red-billed Duck
is not nearly as closely related to the Bahama Duck as one would
gather from an outward examination of the plumage. The marking
of the white cheeks with their distinctive shading into the lower side
of the head, as well as the dark cap, reminds one of Querquedula
versicolor. As I have verified from Heinroth's splendid collection, the
bone-drum stands exactly midway between that of P. bahamensis and
that of the true Garganey Teals. The shape and marking of the back
feathers lie midway between the Pintail and the Garganey Teal.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
Apart from his one display-call the drake seems to be rather silent.
He has, to be sure, a conversation-call but it is so soft that one can
hardly hear it in the open and if the specimen is not particularly tame.
I cannot say whether it has one or two syllables. The " burp " acts
as a lure-call, as it does with the Pintail group.

<bodyText confidence="0.998942272727273" page_id="56291508"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
This is the only behaviour of the social-play which my drake exhibits.
However, as he displays intensively in the company of the Bahama
drakes I do not think that this is caused by his being in captivity.
The action is exactly like that of Dafila and P. bahamensis and, in
addition, the tone that he utters is very similar to that of these species.
At the same time, because of the unique detachment of the individual
vibrations, he reminds one clearly of the wood-creaking note of the
Garganey drake. In contrast to the Pintail and Bahama Duck, and
again conforming with the Garganey, the note is not uttered both as
his head goes up and down but only during one of these motions.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977095162162162" page_id="56291509"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
Querquedula querquedula (L)
A. GENERAL.
Without any doubt the Garganey Teal differs more from any of
the ducks so far discussed than these do from each other. On the
other hand, Q. versicolor , which I unfortunately do not know, is in
its tracheal enlargement and many other characters a Garganey,
but in its head markings, bill colouring, and in other ways it shows
clear relationships with the African Red-billed Duck and the
Bahama Duck and is linked with these species and therefore with the
Pintail group. On the other hand, however, through Q. cyanoptera
and Spatula platalea an equally clear family relationship with the
Shoveler group is apparent which, as we shall see, is also indicated
in the reaction-inventory of Q. querquedula.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
As a conversation note the drake has a short one-syllable " geg . . .
geg . . . geg " which he utters in the same situations as the Mallard
utters his " raebraeb ", especially when annoyed, as for example, when
two drakes cannot get at each other's feathers through a fence. The
female's lure and conversation calls are more like those of the Mallard
than are the corresponding notes of female Dajila and Poecilonetta ,
which all differ by their rasping quality. The duck is really sparing
with her calls. The mood for going or flying away is expressed just
as with the Mallard duck, but the tendency to vertical " pumping "
of the head at any general excitement is more pronounced. In this
Querquedula reminds one very much of the Shoveler.
G. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.
i. Inciting by the Duck.
This differs from that of the Mallard and Pintail group, as well as
from the Chestnut-breasted and Common Teals in that it lacks the
striking succession of rising single notes sounding annoyed and
querulous. Instead of this a one-syllabled disjointed " gaeg " sound
is uttered at every " inciting " movement. In addition one
" pumping " movement is associated with every movement and inciting
note, as though the duck were going to fly away. In both points
the Garganey resembles the Shoveler. Together with (T discors and
Q,. cyanoptera , the Garganey forms a connecting link between the latter
and the other surface-feeding ducks in that the females of these three

species perform, between pumping movements, a typical inciting
movement, linked with an especially distinct stretching of the head
towards the " enemy ", backwards over the shoulder, which the
Shoveler never does.

This is very rare. For a long time I thought that it was lacking in
this species. It is composed of two, at most three, syllables, the last
syllables sounding as if they were swallowed. The rising and dying
down follow so quickly that a peculiar roaring note arises, which
again reminds one of the Shoveler.

<bodyText confidence="0.995931727272727" page_id="56291510"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
Curiously enough, the female Garganey also has at its disposal the
most striking display-act of the male, in which the head is stretched
back with its upper side against the back and then brought back to
its normal position in a great bent-out bow. While doing this the
duck utters a " quaeh-geg " which is stressed on the first syllable.
The duck utters this note when she is participating especially
intensively in the drakes' social play, and is therefore in somewhat
the same mood as that in which the Bahama Duck utters her
" chae-chae-chae ". Like the nod-swimming of the Mallard and
Chestnut-breasted Teal, this reaction is obviously " aretic ", i.e. a
characteristic taken over from the male sex.

D. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE DRAKE.
i. The Introductory Shaking , Drinking , and Mock-preening.
These play an outstanding role in the Garganey drake. Thus, drink-
ing takes place not only as an independent introduction to the social-
play but also, as part of an established component of certain forms
of display. On the other hand, mock-preening is used a great deal in
the introductory part of the display and is repeated in many displays
as often as the introductory shaking. In contrast to the drakes of
most other surface-feeding ducks, Garganey drakes preen the outer

side of the wing, which shows off the bright blue wing coverts very
strikingly (see above and Fig. 28). Even during the introductory part
of the display the drakes mill around (Fig. 27) which, with the
continual shaking and preening, gives the impression of feverish
nervousness.
2. Wing-beating.
Of all the species of duck that I know, the Garganey is the only
one in which Heinroth's so-called " wing-beating 55 has become part
of display. As the excitement of the social display rises, one of the
drakes will rear up in the water and with increasing frequency beat
his wings in a peculiarly short and accentuated manner. This beating
of the wings has, doubtless, like other substitute " comfort activities "
(as Tinbergen would say) been developed from the original instinctive

behaviour into a releasing ceremony in an analogous manner to
mock-preening and introductory shaking. Even before the beginning
of the two display activities now to be described, one sees the trachea
protruding on the neck of the drake. The bird holds his neck drawn-in
short, after the manner of Mallard drakes leading up to social-play,
then slowly the bulge of the windpipe begins to appear. This also
occurs in Dafila , but in this case only at the instant of the display-call
itself (Fig. 24).

All the actions described so far belong to the " introduction " and
not to the social display proper, as they do not consume or exhaust
the specific quality of excitement, but, on the contrary, serve obviously
as self-stimulus, just as I have explained concerning the self-
stimulating effect of the introductory shaking of the Mallard drake,
in contrast to his " true " display behaviour. The first " consumma-
tory " display that we see in the Garganey 5 s social-play consists in
a bird thrusting his head backwards and upwards, the bill remaining

fairly horizontal, and then, just as abruptly, carrying it forward and
downward, so that anyone knowing the species of Anas and the
Chestnut-breasted Teal would certainly be reminded of the first step
of the nod-swimming which follows the 44 bridling " movement
(Fig. 29). However, the action of the Garganey does not seem to
have anything to do with this. While the lifting of the head proceeds
without a sound, in contrast to the 44 burping 55 of the African Red-
billed Duck, as the head springs back into the normal position a short
" Rrrrp " is heard, which is notable more than anything else for the
fact that it is so hard to tell from where it comes. One thinks he
hears the drake several yards away and then the next moment sees
him close at hand. The quality of the tone is deceptively reminiscent
of that of a " Ratsche ", as the wooden rattles used in Southern
Austria are popularly called. These take the place of church bells

in Holy Week and produce a noise by the movement of a resilient
piece of wood over the teeth of a hardwood gear wheel. For
this reason the Garganey is invariably and appropriately called

A knowledge of the movement and call of the African Red-billed
Duck, in which the burp is also directed slightly backwards, leaves
no doubt as to the homology of the burp of the Garganey with that
of Dafila and Poecilonetta. However, the origin of the behaviour I am
now going to describe is more doubtful.

<bodyText confidence="0.998976" page_id="56291512"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
In this astonishing movement the head is laid over the back so
that the forehead lies on the root of the tail (Fig. 30), just as one
sees it pictured in the Common Golden-eye, Bucephala clangula
(P. Bernhardt, J.f. Orn. } 1940, 490). Then, while the head is brought
back in a sweeping curve to the normal position, a loud rattling noise
is belched out, during which the stretched windpipe springs, like the
cord of a bow, to the front of the neck, lifting a high fold of skin.

<bodyText confidence="0.999659642857143" page_id="56291513"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
This is invariably followed by " drinking ". This movement is
performed more frequently than burping in a high display intensity,
while, in a lower intensity, the latter predominates. There is,
therefore, a connection between these two actions which may be
regarded as stages in intensity of one and the same instinctive move-
ment, especially as there are, though rarely, intermediate stages
between the burp and laying-the-head-backwards in the Garganey.
I am therefore inclined to believe that the backward bending has
arisen by an " exaggerated 55 burp. This is also confirmed by the
similarity of the introduction and the similar connection with drinking
in both. Querquedula discors and Q. cyanoptera do not have the movement
just described. The similarity with Bucephala certainly rests upon
convergence, which has arisen from the necessity, found in both
forms, of stretching the bone-drum to a high degree.

The Garganey drake also possesses an orientation reaction in which
the distinctive markings on the side of the head are brought to the
attention of the duck to the best advantage. In contrast to all other
surface-feeding ducks whose head-moving habits are known, the
Garganey drake turns neither the bill nor the back of the head
towards the duck, but the side of the head, and keeps this position
for several seconds directed towards her, with a clearly nystagmic
movement also found in other drakes. With swiftly milling drakes
displaying around a duck quite a number often jerk their heads
nystagmically at the same time. Naturally during the head-turning
the head feathers are set in such a manner that the white line of
the eyebrows attains its maximum significance.

By Thos. T. K. Frelinghuysen (Holmdel, N. Jersey, U.S.A.)
Soon after sunset, the red sky over Midway is overcast with a
dense cloud of birds ; Shearwaters swarm from cool burrows in warm
sand ; Terns returning from fishing grounds, and Albatrosses changing
duty with their mates, fill the air with elegant soaring silhouettes.
Then little by little, as the gloaming fades, the wild confusion of eerie
voices attains symphonic heights as the unseen wind instruments are
whirled through darkened space in complex patterns of infinite
variety. From time to time the muffled thud of feathered bodies
colliding occasionally, followed by a dull thump on the ground, lends
a percussive note to the concert which lasts long into the night.
However, by dawn most of the Petrels have holed in for the day ;
the Sootys and Noddys have gone back to sea, or to their nests on
sand and bush ; the tube-nosed swimmers not engaged with egg or
young are dancing, and the vast upper arena of the sky is cleared for
a single pair of Fairy Terns to perform their heavenly courtship
acrobatics because of which they have come to be known among
seafaring folk as Chinese love-birds.
The twin islets called Midway lie at the western extremity of the
Hawaiian Archipelago, and since 1909 have been designated a bird
sanctuary by the U.S. Government. Even as recently as World
War II the honeycombed villages of moaning Shearwaters and the
extensive nurseries of the two North Pacific Albatrosses were patrolled
by the small flightless, red-eyed Rail (Porzanula polmeri ), which
darted about the nest mounds and tunnel entrances in quest of flies,
and heedless of man. Since then these unique birds have been
exterminated within the narrow confines of their global range by rats.
Sic transit!
The central Pacific proved the temperate nature of the Midway
climate by celebrating New Year's Day of 1943 with a furious storm.
The raging seas made the little atoll tremble on its coral footing, and
from time to time it seemed to be at the bottom of a maelstrom, and
about to be engulfed. At this time, the Laysan and Black-footed
Albatrosses were nesting wherever airstrips, roads, guns, and quarters
had not yet been established. Undaunted by the gale, they had all
turned in their slightly raised nests to face the howling wind ; and
one wide beach was studded with streamlined mounds of sand which
trailed over the backs of the birds for a distance of several feet. Even
the frowning eyebrows of the tight-sitting tubenarians formed grooves
that decorated the sides of the mounds in quite a modern style.
There was one spot where the sea seemed especially tempted to go
ashore and take complete possession of the land. The white water
surged triumphantly through the barbed-wire entanglements as far

as it listed, and it was here that a very small Teal appeared on the
foam like a speck of vanilla in a bowl of ice-cream--a pitiful sight.
But lo--when along with the rest of the ocean its turn came to go
ashore and it rode gallantly up the beach on the crest of a tremendous
wave, instead of wading ashore, at the limit it turned about face and
coasted back into the fury of the gale.
The morning after this storm, the white sand glistened like driven
snow ; and the Australian pines which had been planted in a grove
about the cable station years before, accentuated the illusion of
northern winter. Yet on approaching the grove one heard the singing
of many birds. It sounded exactly like a bird store that has opened
its doors on the first warm day of spring; and were it not for the fact
that the lowly Canary is taboo in bona-fide avicultural circles, I would
state that a former keeper of the station had raised and released many
of these birds several years before. The original stock had come from
Hong Kong ; but all that is off the record here. Suffice it to say that
a large pine was as heavily bedecked as a Christmas tree with small
live yellow birds that reminded one of ordinary Canaries not only in
appearance, but in song and manner of singing with throats distended
and rocking from side to side in ecstasy. Whatever they were, they
deserved considerable credit as Passerines for having clung to their
perches with those ridiculously slender feet in the teeth of a 90 miles
per hour gale that had raged throughout the previous day and night.
Furthermore, these admirable little yellow birds were accompanied
by Laysan Finches (Psittirostra cantans), slightly larger and not too
pretty, but richly endowed with one of the sweetest songs heard from
the throat of a hard-billed bird. The combination was delightful.
Frigates and Boobies visit the islands ; the Red-tailed Tropic Bird
breeds there in large numbers and has a local reputation of being able
to fly backwards as indeed they sometimes do. Golden Plovers en
masse and straggling lesser relatives winter on the beaches ; and small
flocks of Bristle-thighed Curlews lend a major touch of distinction to
the population. These splendid long-bills are extremely wary, and
although unmolested, they show good sense and take to the air at the
sight of man, uttering high wild notes of alarm that flutter the pulse
and make the trigger finger of even the most ardent conservationist
tremble ever so slightly. Rumour has it that they puncture the eggs
of the Albatrosses and eat the contents ; but it was not confirmed by
observation. A brooding Albatross would be more than a match, for
it sits tight and is free in the use of its punishing beak. Indeed, if the
Diomeds could only have exchanged their real troubles for the fantastic
worry of Curlews, they would have been far better off than they were
at that time.
On returning in November for the breeding season after several
months at sea, their losing conflict with civilization would begin.

Former nesting areas had meanwhile been bulldozed into airplane
runways, and presented a problem with which their evolution as a
sea bird that nests on uninhabited islands had not prepared them to
cope. They would stand in bewilderment on the paved location of
their former homes, or soar above them heedless of the planes which
consequently killed and injured countless numbers. And although a
launch could not approach a congregation on the lagoon without the
whole flock taking to their huge webbed feet and running over the
surface until carried aloft by their impetus, yet on land when a truck
would approach one wandering down a new lane through the bushes
in search of its nest, it would simply lean aside like a man to let the
wheeled monster go by, the difference being due to the hereditary
acquaintance of these birds with dangers at sea, but not on land.
It was amusing to watch the first landings of these great soarers
who seldom flap except in a calm, after having lost their land-legs
during months at sea. At first they crash and somersault clumsily ;
later they relearn the approved technique and let themselves down
on the flats of their feet with very nice precision.
They are devoted parents and relieve one another fairly in the care
of the single grey downy young which has great charm. So many fat
poodle puppies are still--thank the Lord--annually converted into
animate tumbletugs with beaks.
Attempts were made to save the new generation of an area which
had to be cleared for building ; but although in some cases the
nestling was moved not more than three feet, the anxious parents
were not able to recognize their young once its exact location had
been changed.
On being lifted from the nest the baby Albatross regurgitates a
clear oily amber fluid from which emanates a subtle but pervading
aroma of the sea. It so resembles a fine liqueur that it could be a
distillate of the tiny night-surfacing squid--Loligo--that Frank T.
Bullen in his Creatures of the Sea credits with a capacity for enjoyment
of being eaten, since that passive but important occupation seems to
be its cardinal role in nature.
Of the two species of Diomeds which breed on the Midway reef,
the white Laysan Albatross, which has dark wings and does not
follow ships, is slightly smaller and a trifle more elegant and discerning
than the slate-coloured Black-footed one, but both are very handsome,
and when alerted in the excitement of the dance, their large dark eyes
and arching necks suggest the nobility of high-caste horses in an
abstract kind of a way, while their deep-throated utterances are
acutely analogous to a lowing herd of cattle responding to the baton
of a competent conductor.
The fortunate fact that the elaborate dance ritual of the North
Pacific Albatrosses has already been so well described, makes it

possible to conclude this recollection by citing one instance which
seems significant of the indomitable, however unconscious, stoicism
that marked the behaviour of these splendid birds under the stress
of war.
A steel water tower 150 feet high had to be wrecked because of its
danger as a landmark. After a vain attempt had been made to clear
the immediate environment of birds, the dynamite was detonated,
and it fell with a terrific crash. One foot from the once lofty pinnacle
now embedded in the sand, on her single egg, sat an Albatross. She
had faced the collapse of the huge gadget with her customary frown.

Before opening the meeting the Chairman drew attention to the
fact that this was the first meeting in the new reign. The Loyal
Toast was then drunk.
The Chairman introduced the speaker of the evening, His Grace
the Duke of Bedford, who had chosen for his subject, " Liberty
Aviculture." The Duke gave a graphic review of the many species
kept at liberty both at Woburn and Havant--Cranes, Waterfowl,
Pheasants, small exotics, Parrakeets, etc. It is not proposed to deal
more fully with what proved to be an absorbingly interesting talk as
it is hoped a full account will appear in the Magazine at a later date.

Captain R. W. Veitch, who has been so very successful in the
breeding of Alexandrine Parrakeets, draws our attention to a recent
advertisement which offers for sale : "27 Alexandrine Parrakeets,
English, beautiful condition, #5 each."
It is grossly unfair to genuine breeders for dealers to offer imported
birds as English-bred. If these so-called English birds are put outside
and die, as they probably will, the English stocks are certain to get
a bad name.
This malpractice, all too common in the past, is much to be
deprecated ; it is, of course, misrepresentation of the worst kind.
Potential purchasers are strongly recommended to avoid dealings with
any such advertiser.

As was to be expected, the arrival of Mr. Frost with a collection of
Indo-Malaysian birds resulted in the addition of some attractive
specimens to the Society's collection.
These included a Ceylon Hill Mynah* (Eulabes ptilogenys ) ; a pair
of Javan Black-throated Fruitsuckersj (Chloropsis cochinchinensis
nigricollis ), of which an excellent coloured plate appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine (Fifth Series, Vol. II, No. 1, 1937), together
with a description by Mrs. Wharton-Tigar ; two Turquoise Fairy
Bluebirds (Irena turcosa) ; one Greater Bird of Paradise (Paradisea
apoda) ; one Timor Crimson-winged Parrakeet (Aprosmictus jonquil -
aceus), and one Javan Jungle fowl (Galius varius).
The presentations include a pair of tame Globose Curassows ( Crax
globicera) ; a Virginian Cardinal {Cardinalis cardinalis) ; a pair of
Bullfinches ( Pyrrhula p . ms a) ; a Nepal Hill Mynah ( Eulabes intermedia ) ;
a Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrot ( Amazona ochrocephala) ; a Razor-
bill ( Alca tor da), and a Lapwing ( Vanellm vanellus), while those received
in exchange were a pair of Demoiselle Cranes ( Anthropoides virgo) ;
a Blood-breasted (or Bleeding-heart) Pigeon ( Gallicolumba luzonica ) ;
a lutino Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet ( Psittacula krameri manillensis) ;
two Greenland White-fronted Geesef ( Anser albifrons flavirostris) ;

This is a book for all bird enthusiasts who travel--and which of
them does not--whether only in day-dreaming fancy or vicariously
by the spoken or printed word, or in neighbourhood ramble, or, best
of all, by pilgrimage over hill and down dale on the endless public
highway for personal, first-hand, on-the-spot observation and enjoy-
ment of birds and their ways and the places where they sojourn or
dwell. This guide to bird-finding will be found to be no mere recital
of grouped bird and place names, useful on occasion though uninspiring
as dishwater, but a treasury of bird lore--rich, yet not lush, with
descriptive aids to the imagination.
In other words, this book is encyclopedic with respect to its main
intent, which is to be "a guide to the exact locales of each species
. . . with detailed information on how to reach each spot, where to
stay overnight . . . what birds are to be found at what times and at
what places ", and yet, despite the preponderantly utilitarian
purposes, decidedly " literary "--written with care in choice of
subject matter and with charm of style to please aesthetically as well
as to inform.
The book should nourish the ambition, which presumably every
ornithologist has, whether professional or amateur, to visit in the
course of the years the east-state bird haunts most famed and others
most alluring to him personally--an achievement far from insuperable
in this age of the motor car and rapid transit at individual whim.
So, ye lovers of birds in the wild, have this volume at hand when
next you plan a cross-country business, professional, or vacation trip.
Though its many pages include an elaborate index and a vast store
of information, it has been kept to " pocket size "--altogether an
ideal " field companion ", easy to carry, handle, consult.
Carl Naether.

and 324 coloured illustrations. Franckh'sche Verlagshandlung,
W. Keller and Co., Stuttgart, 1950. 106 pages. $2.00.
Without question this handy, pocket-sized book, containing useful
and easily understood tables and illustrations of 396 species of
Middle-European birds, is one of the best published to date. It
constitutes an entirely new revised edition of a book by the same
title, authored by Goetz and Kosch a good many years ago. Already
in an edition of 92,000 copies, the book bids fair to become a best
seller, and no wonder.
It is very compact, giving first of all a seven-point explanation for
the use of the various tables. The following first section offers a review
of essential characteristics for identifying distinct groups of birds, as
songbirds, birds of prey, pigeons, etc. These characteristics are stated
very concisely and clearly and excellent silhouettes, usually showing
the bird flying, add greatly to emphasize significant traits of the birds.
The finest (and beautiful ) aspect of this splendid little book is the
coloured illustrations, and I have yet to see more natural ones
in any bird-book anywhere. The colours are superb and the poses
so lifelike as to make recognition a pleasure and a privilege indeed.
Opposite each coloured plate--it illustrates anywhere from ten to
fifteen different species of birds--we find data relating to the size,
special characteristics, habitat, and name (scientific and German) of
each bird. If only the English names had been added, what a sale
this book would find among English-speaking bird students !
Unquestionably this little book sets a standard in avian literature.
Would that we had its equal in beauty, clarity, and compactness as
relating to birds of other countries. A " must 55 for every bird student's
library. Carl Naether.

Breeding Elegant Parrakeets.

<bodyText confidence="0.996627066666667" page_id="56291522"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
In my collection of Parrakeets I have pairs each of Pennants, Many Colours,
Stanleys, Redrumps, Bourkes, Princess of Wales, and three pairs of Elegants plus
one young hen of 1951 breeding.
I was very thrilled to end up the season with eighteen young Elegants from the
three pairs and the results are in a way rather interesting, indeed, the whole story
has its points.
The original pair arrived from Australia in the autumn of 1946, having been
bred in the early part of that year. I was not disappointed when they did not breed
in 1947 because of their age, but they grew into beautifully strong, healthy birds.
They developed a taste for a small brand of sunflower seed I was using at the time,
and ever since all have had little other than plain canary and the above sunflower--
occasionally a little white millet, but except during the winters they have consumed
a great amount of green food, with seeding heads of dandelion as first favourite. In
fact, all my young Elegants have been reared largely on these dandelion seed heads.
In 1948 they had three young ones, which I kept for stock, putting them in an

aviary by themselves. These became very fine birds--fully better than their parents.
Still I did not expect anything from the young ones that year. The old pair again
( I 949) had three young--they have not varied from their established practice of
three per year. Then I missed the young hen who, as I say, was occupying a flight
with her two brothers. I found her in a log which I had not troubled to remove,
sitting very closely on four eggs. Three duly hatched and were reared, but--
Query A--which was the father ? Both young cocks attended the young which,
with three " parents ", developed into grand birds. These I disposed of.
I started 1950 with three pairs--the original pair, brother and sister (here I was
apparently lucky enough to select the correct partner for the hen), and the other
young cock with a hen I obtained from a member of the A.S. Results in 1950 were
the usual three from pair No. 1, three from pair No. 2, but nothing at all from pair
No. 3--the hen not settling down very well.
1951 found me with the same three pairs not expecting anything out of the
ordinary. But this time all three pairs went to nest. Pair No. 1, three eggs (as
usual), three hatched and reared ; pair No. 2, four eggs (ditto), three hatched and
reared ; pair No. 3, five eggs (a pleasant surprise), five hatched and reared. These
actually surpassed anything I have yet had. and it is a young hen from this nest
that I have kept.
Then to my agreeable surprise pair No. 2 went to nest again and laid the usual
four eggs, hatching and rearing three as before--making nine in the two seasons.
Not to be outdone--and perhaps because it was " Festival Year "--pair No. 3
decided to have " another go " and laid four eggs, which duly hatched and were
reared. Nine in one season ! All the time I was on tenter hooks in case the Duke of
Bedford's " X " found out what was going on up North, but apparently " he " or
" it " was fully occupied with more valuable collections than mine. I hope this
account does not come to the notice of " X " otherwise I may get a visit next year.
Be that as it may, all my surplus youngsters have gone, and if their new owners
get as much thrill out of them as I have had it will make up for many of the
disappointments we get in this avicultural business. j Baty

Although I have both judged and exhibited at shows and would not condemn
bird shows as being always, of necessity, evil institutions, I must confess I find
myself in a considerable measure of agreement with Mr. Goodwin. Standard show
cages for British, budgerigars and many foreign are much too small and are
calculated to make the bad impression on visitors Mr. Goodwin refers to. Usually
nothing short of an earthquake will shift the average British citizen out of established
custom but, for the sake both of the birds and of the good name of aviculture, such
an earthquake is long overdue in the Bird Fancy. Bedford

which I should like to pair with a hen bird of the same species ; and I should be
most grateful if any member of the Avicultural Society has a hen they would let me
know, so we could come to an arrangement over breeding from them. My bird
is very healthy and full of life--it talks a little--it says " Hello Polly ".
I was most interested to read Mr. G. lies' article in the Avicultural Magazine
of 1950, on thp Belle Vue Zoo collection of birds, but in my humble opinion I believe
their bird to be a Bare-eyed Cockatoo. There is a plate of this Cockatoo in Goulds

THE SCARLET FLYCATCHER IN FREEDOM
AND CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99777003125" page_id="56291530"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Dr. Joachim Steinbacher (Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany)
The Tyrannidae or Tyrant Flycatchers is a family which is confined
to America where it occurs from Alaska to Patagonia. Predominantly
small birds--the largest forms are the size of a Blackbird--most of
them are found in South America, particularly in tropical regions.
Many of them behave so strikingly and characteristically that they
are the best known birds of their range--such are the King Bird
{Tyrannus tyrannus), the Phoebe (Sayornis phcebe), or the Scissor-tailed
Flycatcher {Muscivora forticata) in the United States, and the Benteri
(Pitangus sulphuratus) , or the Spectacled Flycatcher ( Lichenops perspi-
cillata ) in Brazil and Argentine respectively. Some of them have
partially attached themselves to man and breed near human habita-
tions, while other species prefer the loneliness of the mountains, the
dimness of the tropical rain forests, or the sunny expanses of the
prairies and savannahs. Here they live like the species of Flycatcher
of the Old World, the large forms similar to Shrikes in that they
pursue insects from elevated positions and in addition occasionally
also take small mammals, always at once returning to their original
perching place. According to C. E. Hellmayr, who in 1927 undertook
the working out of the last monograph of the whole group, there are
nearly 400 species, 115 genera and 7 sub-families included under
this name. He characterized the violently quarrelsome disposition,
the fighting temperament, the pronounced aggressiveness in defence
of territory in all members of the family, which certainly is unique.
This is neither confined to certain seasons nor to birds of the same
size as is usually the rule.
Among the predominantly plainly coloured Tyrant Flycatchers,
which mostly have grey upperparts and yellow or white underparts,
is a species which is remarkable for its red plumage, the Scarlet
(Tyrant) Flycatcher ( Pyrocephalus rubinus). Its scientific name indicates
this even if it had no other name than " Firehead " and similarly also
is the Spanish designation " Bazita de fuego "--" Little flash of fire."

84 dr. JOACHIM STEINBACHER-THE SCARLET FLYCATCHER
This little bird of the size of a European Flycatcher, which is as
much at home in the wide areas of southern North America as in
Brazil and Argentine, ranges over an incredibly large area in which
it is split up into eight slightly different races. It occupies a happy
position in the folklore of the Brazilians, as it is regarded as a pledge
and talisman of true love. This is undoubtedly the reason for its
plentifulness and for the affection in which it is held by all inhabitants
of tropical South America. In the sun-baked plateaus of Mexico,
the dry steppes and deserts of Texas and California, where it fills
a montonous lifeless landscape with colour and life, it is a special
pleasure to come across it. On this account certain scientific observers
became so enchanted with its attractive vitality that they often almost
overlooked the scientific significance of its evolutions, whether it was
Burmeister and Schomburg in the old days or Beebe and Bent in
more recent times. The last-named, in particular, sketched a
captivating life history of the most northerly race of the Scarlet
Flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus mexicanus ) in Bulletin 179 "Life
Histories of North American Flycatchers, Larks, Swallows, and their
Allies H. W. Sagner referred to a special peculiarity of this form
in that already long before the true breeding season, which here
coincides with the beginning of the rainy season, pairs are formed in
order to make the best use of the short season when food is abundant.
Therefore immediately after the setting in of the first rains the building
of the nest can start at once. H. Krieg found the typical form
(.Pyrocephalus r. rubinus ) in Argentine and Paraguay a common in-
habitant of the open savannahs, sitting on the outer branches of
bushes, and H. Sick confirms this for the interior of Brazil where the
bird is regularly met with in open wood and bush country, occasionally
also in the fringing forests along the large rivers. It is nevertheless
striking that this species disappears again soon after the cares of the
breeding season are over and then obviously carries out a northerly
migration. This can perhaps also be explained as an adaptation to
the exigencies of climate, as with the beginning of the dry season the
bird starts to search for damp places near the tropical rain forests.
Normally quite quiet and almost sluggish except for soft calls in flight
and lure notes, and without any characteristic voice worthy of note,
during the breeding season the bird carries out small display flights
over its territory which are occasionally accompanied by a kind of
excited song, a series of sharp-toned call-notes. The nest, which mostly
hangs horizontally and is well hidden, is firmly built and often inter-
woven with spiders' webs. It contains 2-3 white eggs flecked with
brown.
Though in his well-known work Gefangene Vogel , 1876, A. E. Brehm
clearly emphasizes the merits of the Tyrant Flycatcher as a cage
bird and praises its indifference to what it eats and its entertaining

disposition, and though most species occur in sufficient numbers to
make their capture and transport to Europe an easy matter, never-
theless until recently representatives of this group of birds were rare,
and only isolated specimens were to be found in Zoological Gardens
and in the possession of private individuals. In the last edition of his
Fremdlandischen Stubenwgel, Neunzig mentioned only ten species as
having been imported into Europe (1921) and since then this number
has not materially increased. This may have some connection with
the limited accommodation which zoological gardens as well as
private individuals must always take into consideration, as the Tyrants
need plenty of space and have to be kept alone if there is not to be
strife. Therefore we only had such species as Pitangus sulphuratus ,
Fluvicola climazura, Arundinicola leucocephala , Elaenis spectabilis , Serpo-
phaga nigricans , and Lichenops perspecillata, but never the Scarlet Fly-
catcher. But in the Avicultural Magazine, 1935, a female of the
latter species was reported to have been brought to England and at
the same time H. O. Wagner saw a specimen in an importation at
Antwerp. Whether the female soon died and the bird imported into
Antwerp went to the United States, where Pyrocephalus rubinus now is
to be found here and there in zoological gardens, remains uncertain.
In any event I was very pleased when, at the beginning of 1951,
Mr. C. U. L. Behrend, Buenos Aires, promised to send me a pair of
Scarlet Flycatchers, which arrived on the 7th March in good condition
after a long air journey. As far as is at present known they are the
first pair of this species to arrive in Europe. From the first the
birds were quiet and confiding, in spite of the fact that they had only
been in captivity for fourteen days, and at once took to the usual soft
food which is given to Nightingales. The female even took meal-
worms from the hand after a few days, but after six months in captivity
the male still does not do this. For fear that they might perhaps not
live long, I had several different coloured sketches made of the birds
which show them in several characteristic positions. Fortunately,
however, they proved to be hardy, went through the first full moult
without difficulty, and became increasingly confiding, but all the
same I had to give them special care.
In the summer the male lost the pretty ruby red colour of his
feathers except for some red spots on the back of the head, breast,
and belly, and assumed a speckled grey dress. I nevertheless hope
that in autumn he will moult back into his red breeding plumage, as
already several new red feathers are showing on his head, neck, and
breast. This second moult appears to cause the birds more difficulty
than the first, which is obvious by the discomfort shown by the birds.
I will add a few words on the behaviour of the Scarlet Flycatcher
so far as I have been able to observe it up to the present. Most
striking was the frequent erection of the feathers of the crown, a

behaviour pattern which appears to be typical of males of many Tyrants.
This is interpreted as a threatening attitude since the bright colours
of the feathers of the crown are brought into prominence. Also
worthy of note was the short hovering flight performed by both sexes,
but more frequently by the male, when they took water or food.
The taking of water often preceded the flight, since the bird flew
with lowered beak over the surface of the water and then hovered.
Larger pieces of food were always broken up on the perching branch
by several blows from the beak before they were swallowed. More-
over the female often pulled away the best pieces from the slower or
more cautious male, even taking them out of his beak. The male
often stared with his head on one side at worms freshly thrown in, and
also at the food bowl, but this habit was not observed in the female.
The ejection of undigested remains of food as pellets occurred regularly,
according to the kind of food, several times a day, accompanied by
violent jerking of the head. The sexes kept very close together, but
as in other behaviour the female seemed to take the lead.

A. GENERAL.
Without doubt, the Shoveler can be regarded as an extreme type
of the Garganey group. This is clear not only in its behaviour, but
also in certain colour characters common to both groups. I may
mention the striking and almost identical distinctive markings of
Querquedula cyanoptera and Spatula platalea , both natives of South
America. According to all previous accounts, the Shoveler is not

supposed to have a social courtship display as do all other surface-feed-
ing ducks. However, practically no zoological garden or fancier has a
good number of first class Shovelers, and I still suspect, in view of
the unusually highly developed breeding plumage of the species,
that they might possess a form of display as yet unknown to us which,
for some reason, they never show in captivity.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
In contrast to all the Anatidae that I know, Shoveler ducklings have
two distinct " whistles-of-desertion 55 . The " tit tit tit " uttered
rather rapidly at lower levels of intensity, suddenly, at higher levels
strikes a long drawn-out " teet teet teet The conversation-call and
the call-note of the female are generally Mallard-like, but the drake
has only one call, a rather hoarse " chat " which, uttered in succession
either slowly or quickly, must fill the role of both the long " Raeaeb "
and the two-syllabled " Raebraeb " of the Mallard drake. A thing
peculiar to the Shoveler alone among all surface-feeding ducks I know,
indeed by all Anatidae, is that it lacks the drinking performance.
In its place is brought in, as a substitute activity, the gabbling which
is so prominent a character of the Shoveler, along with the corre-
sponding differentiation of the bill, so that its meaning is quite like
the drinking of other ducks. In this gabbling the drake says
" chat . . chat . . chat " very quickly.
In any excitement, Shovelers make those pumping head movements
which other ducks use only during the introduction to mating. In
this respect (T discors and cyanoptera behave exactly like the Shoveler !
Even ducklings and half-grown birds do this. Heinroth has already
described a peculiar habit of the little ducklings. Lined up, one close
behind the other, they swim around in little circles, so that they
gabble with bills straining the water. One Shoveler gabbles right at
the stern of another, and thus, obviously takes in the small plants
and animals he has stirred up.

In the female this corresponds, as far as the movements of the
head and neck are concerned, exactly to the pre-coital pumping
of all true surface-feeding ducks. The call, in rhythm and tone-
colour, as well as its significance, is quite clearly recognizable as
inciting. However, there is lacking the accompanying threatening
movement of the head, directed towards the enemy, which is present
in the Garganey female and alternates with the pumping movement.

<bodyText confidence="0.954315166666667" page_id="56291535"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
This is worthy of special mention here, in that whereas the pump-
ing behaviour in other surface-feeding ducks serves solely as a
function of the prelude to mating, in the Shoveler it has become so
very prevalent that it has become a general gesture of excitement
possible of employment in a great many connections. As already
mentioned in the section on inciting, it has entirely taken the place
of the side movements of the head. All this, again, is exactly the same
in discors and cyanoptera.
D. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE DRAKE.
As already stated, I do not believe in the complete lack of social
display in drakes in Spatula. In my opinion the bright colours of the
drake say more for its existence than the absence of conclusive observa-
tions does against it. I intend, as soon as possible, to breed a greater
number of Shovelers with the care that they require, so as to be able
to observe several young drakes mating. In scientific books the
difficulty of keeping Shovelers is generally over-estimated. One of
my females, bred from an egg, had perfect offspring last year, and is
now in the best of condition, having survived all the dangers of the

1. Turning the back of the head.
Except for the gabbling which the Shoveler drake uses in the
presence of the female at every opportunity, a distinct turning of the
back of the head is the only display activity known to me. While
doing so, he holds his feathers in a way corresponding throughout to
the special " set " of the Mallard drake's plumage in the corresponding
behaviour.

<bodyText confidence="0.981515947368421" page_id="56291536"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
With this form we come to a new group of ducks which are connected
just as clearly with the Mallard as the various Anatinae already dealt
with, but in quite another line of development. Let me remind you
of what I said at the beginning about the method of reconstructing
relationship links. If we place the ducks already mentioned more or
less in a line running from the Mallard to the Shoveler, the forms we
are going to speak of now constitute a little group where such a
classification would not work at all. The ducks I know which belong
to this group are : the Chestnut-breasted Teal, the Grey Teal ( Virago
gibberifrons) , the European Common Teal {Nettion crecca ), and the
Yellow-billed Teal ( Nettion flavirostre). One could class these ducks
together as 44 Green-winged Teals ", because they have, along with
very distinctive black and green specula, a courtship whistle which is
distinctive of them alone, and is provided with a peculiar preliminary
note which has given them the German name 44 Krickente ".
The Chestnut-breasted Teal, as well as V. gibberifrons , shows, in
several respects, a significant connection with the Mallards. Between
themselves these two species are just as closely related as the Mallard
species with a showy breeding plumage, are to those without one.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
In the female, these correspond closely enough to those of the
Mallard, but in the predominance of a continual creaking sound it
reminds one somewhat of the Pintail. Apart from display the drake
is almost silent, yet he often uses the softly breathing 44 voice 55 . I
cannot say for certain whether he has a one-syllabled call-note and
a two-syllabled conversation-note. However, I am quite sure that
the 44 Krick 55 whistle, which I shall describe later, in both Virago
and the two Nettion species known to me, fulfils the function of a
call-note and warning note of the drake, corresponding entirely to the
44 Raeaeb " of the Mallard and the 44 e e e e e P 55 of the Pintail.

The continuously rising creaking note is quite like that of the Pintail

Alone among the surface-feeding ducks known to me, except the
species of Anas in the narrow sense, the female Chestnut-breasted
Teal has a pronounced nod-swimming. The behaviour is much more
highly differentiated than that of the Mallard. Not only are the
nod-movements more pronounced, that is, more strongly " mimic-
exaggerated " than the latter, but they are also introduced by a slight
" bridling " which in Anas occurs only in the drake. Finally, the
Chestnut-breasted duck distinctly turns the back of her head to the
drake when the nod-swimming is over, which Mallard females never
do. One has the impression that the high differentiation of bridling
and nod-swimming, which is the outstanding characteristic of the
display of the drake Chestnut-breasted Teal, has in some manner
or other been " handed over " to the female.

Of all surface-feeding ducks, this is most like that of the species of
Anas.
The gathering of the drakes, the relative indifference to the presence
of females, of which notice is taken only in the turning of the head,
the " solemn 55 rest before display, and the introductory shaking,
remind one throughout of Anas. Moreover, Virago , alone among the
Anatinae (Table), possesses all the display behaviour which we have
come to know in the Mallard, and in addition, it has another which
is lacking in the Mallard.

<bodyText confidence="0.999008272727273" page_id="56291537"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
After an introductory shaking the drake does not lift his head very
far ; he does not thrust it as far upward as is done in the burp.
While his head is in a position of rest, there follows a little nodding
sneeze-movement, in which the lower mandible flaps down as if on
a spring and a whistle with a preliminary note is uttered, which can
be represented by " P-zih ". The sound, forced out simultaneously
with the movement of the head, gives the impression of a sneeze. In
the burp of the drake Pintail one has the impression that the thrusting-
up of the head is in itself the mechanical cause for the release of the
whistle. At a higher intensity of the movement and correspondingly
higher lifting of the head, the whistle comes exactly at the culmination

point of the movement, and always when a certain degree of stretching
has been reached, as though a mechanical release mechanism in the
syrinx was worked through the stretching of the trachea, like cocking
a gun. On the other hand, in the case of the krick-whistle of V. castanea,
it is obviously a muscular function independent of the lifting of the
head, which lets off the whistle ; and, indeed, one in which the
muscles of the lower jaw take the controlling part. The whistle comes
when the head is held at rest with the neck stretched.
The distribution of the krick-whistle in the species of the family
seems to be the same as that of the peculiar sharply bisected black and
gold-green speculum. I know that of Virago and Nettion. In the
former the similarity between this whistle and burp behaviour, and
especially the fact that, just like the true burp of Dafila and Pcecilonetta
drakes, it has the combined significance of the lure and warning call
which we learned in the Mallard's long drawn " Raeaeaeb ",
makes me think that it represents a more advanced stage of the
differentiation of the burp, just as this itself may have arisen from a
greater differentiation of the ordinary watchful lifting of the head
that accompanies each lure and warning call of all Anatidae. This is
supported by the fact that the krick-whistle, precisely in its function
of luring and warning, has become more independent of the original
function of all drake whistles in the social display, than in anything
else. Virago and Nettion drakes sound their krick-whistle on every
occasion even without being in the mood for display, about as often
and with as many meanings as a Mallard utters his " Raeaeb ".

<bodyText confidence="0.999307454545454" page_id="56291538"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
This is similar to that of Pintails and, as with them, it occurs as
an independent act, not, as in the case of the Mallard drake, linked
with the head-up-tail-up. There is no sound to be heard, but from
the movement of the bill I think it may be assumed that the muscle
co-ordination of the breathing apparatus is like that in the " Geeee-
geeee " of the Dafila drake ; however it produces only an inaudible
breathing, a rudiment of the voiced note. The whistle, which is
always heard in the burp of Virago and Nettion drakes (not, as in
Dafila , only at a high level of reaction-intensity) is short and one-
syllabled and has a sharp " ee " sound, not a flute-like " oo " sound
as in Dafila.

the succeeding behaviour of burping, bridling, and nod-swimming. The
behaviour pattern of the initial step, as well as the head-up-tail-up
proper is almost like that of Anas except that the elbows are lifted

without being raised or brought away from the upper contour of

the back on a track (Fig. 31). At the same time, the Chestnut-breasted
drake utters a one-syllabled shrill whistle after the Mallard fashion.
The distribution of the separately uttered bridling whistle is exactly
the same as that of the krick-whistle and of the black-green speculum.
I have already mentioned, in reference to the Mallard, its probable
origin from the introductory intention-behaviour for nod-swimming.
7. Chin-lifting.
In the midst of the social-play, very often after one of the drakes
has performed the grunt-whistle, the head-up-tail-up, or the burp,
several of the drakes will thrust their heads high with chin raised and
remain at the peak of this movement for several seconds, during
which they have to tread water in order to hold an upright position,
just as the Bahama drake does in his exaggerated and prolonged
head-up-tail-up (Fig. 32). The movement reminds one forcibly of
the lifting of the chin which follows the Mallard's down-up move-
ment, being extraordinarily similar, both in the manner of employ-
ment of the movement and its simultaneous appearance in several
drakes. This chin-lifting has surely come from the down-up move-
ment and therefore indirectly from a drinking movement. The

dropping out of a lowering of the bill to the water surface, present in
this original behaviour, speaks just as little against the homology as
does the exaggeration of the ensuing lifting of the chin. In the
Gadwall, we shall see a certain homology of the down-up action of
the Mallard drake, in which the introductory downward movement
of the bill has also fallen into disuse.
8. Nod-swimming.
As with the Mallard drake, nod-swimming occurs in the male
Chestnut-breasted Teal only in linkage with other preceding display
activities. From the physiological and the systematic points of view,
this linkage is one of the most interesting parts of the instinctive
courtship behaviour of surface-feeding ducks. In the Mallard drake,
the bridling and the nod-swimming occur only, as acts already
differentiated, after the head-up-tail-up or after mating, in obligate
linkage with these two very different in-
stinctive movements. Neither bridling nor
nod-swimming, in the Mallard drake, ever
occurs alone, while the Chestnut-breasted
drake's much more highly differentiated
bridling has become an independent dis-
play movement. At higher intensities of Fig. 33.--Diagram of the
display, obviously beyond a precisely pre- ^eaWn ^nod-
determined level of activity--specific ex- swimming. Compare with
citation, the grunt-whistle, head-up-tail-up, Figs. 6 and 14.
burp, head-turning, bridling, nod-swimming, and the turning-of-the-
back-of-the-head in the Chestnut-breasted drake merge into single
complex and firmly linked series of movements. Also, in Virago , all
the actions named are either linked together, or each one occurs
alone, with the single exception of nod-swimming and the turning-
of-the-back-of-the-head which occur only in linkage. The physio-
logical peculiarity in this lies in the fact that the linkages between grunt-
whistle and head-up-tail-up, between head-up-tail-up and bridling,
and between bridling and nod-swimming apparently enter into play
or break off precisely at the same level, as fragments of this behaviour-
chain never occur, but always either individual acts or the whole chain
of behaviour. Nod-swimming itself, as well as bridling, is noticeably
more mimic-exaggerated than in the Mallard. That the origin of
the bridling is from putting the head back for the first nod, becomes
very clear in the Chestnut-breasted Teal from the fact that, not
merely when he starts to swim, but before each nod the head is laid
so far on the back that one gets the impression of the bridling move-
ment (see Fig. 33). The turning-of-the-back-of-the-head is quite
similar to that of the Mallard drake both in the behaviour pattern
and the way the head plumage is held, and is very striking because of

The above prosaic title does not begin to express the delight and
pleasure derived from the advent of many species, old and new, which
have augmented our varied collection during the last year.
We will name first those species new to the collection, some of which,
of course, are not new to the readers of this article who are connected
with the bird departments of the various other zoological gardens.
In scientific order we will start with the four Ringed Penguins
(.Pygoscelis antarctica). These are new to this country and are very
attractive in action and appearance. A trifle smaller than the
commoner Humboldt Penguin they are distinctive in having a black
chin-strap drawn across the throat just below the chin. They are
black above and snowy-white below. They swim with all possible
speed in their 20 feet long tank, then suddenly shoot upright out of
the water on to the top of the rocks two feet above the surface. They
were eager to feed from our hands from the day of arrival, and their
unusual vivacity adds much to the rather solemn demeanour of the
Kings and Humboldts. There were two new Kings added at the
same time to our other assemblage of Kings, some of which we have
had over five years.
Black-necked Storks ( Xenorhynchus asiaticus) have been seen in
several of our American zoos, but this is the first time we have had
them. They are not too common, however, and we have one pair, of
which one is noticeably larger and has brown eyes, while the smaller
one has yellow eyes. This is a sexual distinction and I believe the
brown-eyed bird to be the female. They are superficially like the
larger Saddle-billed Stork, but their foot-long beaks are all black and
the legs are red. Otherwise the black and white coloration is very

similar. I saw the Australian form of this species in the beautiful
Taronga Park Zoo, and wanted to take one back to the States, but
they were not so inclined.
Sacred Ibis ( Threskiornis aethiopica). For the first time we have these
interesting birds and it is years since I have seen any in any zoo.
They are attractive with their leathery black necks and metallic-
glossed black wing plumes. In 1949 we brought two of the very
similar Australian Sacred Ibis (T. a. strictipennis) . They have less of
the neck bare and the black plumes on the wings are grizzled with
white. They are also a trifle smaller in size. In the Asiatic Black-
necked Ibis (T. melanocephala ) the wing-plumes are grey. We have
had this bird in the past.
Cackling Goose ( Branta canadensis minima ). These diminutives of the
big Canadian Goose are rather rare in collections. They are found
on the coast of Alaska and the Aleutians and winter along our Pacific
coast down to San Diego, California. They are stately little birds and
attractive. A little larger than a Mallard.
Lesser Tree Ducks (Dendrocygna javanica). These little tree ducks
remind one of our native Fulvous Tree Ducks as they are very similar
in colour. They are rarely imported though many have been reared
on the West Coast.
Condor ( Vultur gryphus). These great birds are famed in legend
and fiction as being the largest birds that fly and so they are, as their
wing expanse ranges from 9 to 11 feet and the weight is in the neigh-
bourhood of 25 pounds. They are not too rare, but few zoos have the
space to give them. They do need some space to fly, but do not
always appreciate the very large flight cages some zoos give them.
Any confined space is not large enough for a condor or an eagle so
far as flight is concerned. They are happiest when they can soar
aloft without any boundaries. However they can live and become
tame in limited quarters. We have two, a fully adult male and a
young male under the 7 years, said to be needed to develop the full
colour pattern of black and white. The young birds are brown all
over, and I believe it is Mrs. Benchley who wrote that the comb on
the head is noticeable on the male from the time of hatching. The
female lacks this appendage.
Crested Eagle ( Morphnus guianensis). This eagle is seldom seen in
captivity, and is reminiscent of the larger Harpy Eagle. It is found
from Honduras to Peru.
Hawk-eagle ( Spizaetus ornatus). Another beautiful bird of prey
very seldom seen. It is a strikingly marked bird with legs feathered
to the toes, and it has an ornamental crest of erectile feathers. Found
from Mexico to Argentina.
Spengel's Parrotlet {Forpus spengeli). These are the smallest of the
parrotlets, and so closely resemble the Mexican Parrotlet that it needs

close scrutiny to tell them apart. Aside from size the face of the male
differs in being a more brilliant green, and the beautiful turquoise of
the Mexican species is even more exquisite in the Spengel's. The
chief difference in the two species is that the female of Spengel's
Parrotlet has a decided yellow tinge on the forehead. Differing in
this respect from all the other species. Native of Colombia, South
America.
Blue-crowned Conures ( Aratinga acuticauda haemmorhous). These are
rather unattractive birds of a family noted for brilliant colouration.
They are plain green with a shade of dull red on the underside of the
tail. They are found in Eastern Brazil, South America.
Hartlaub's Touraco ( Turacus hartlaubi). These too, are not as
brilliantly coloured as some of the other green touracos but of course,
have the wing primaries brilliant carmine.
Hooded Warbler ( Wilsonia citrina). This is one of our native birds,
a member of the great American family of Wood-warblers. All are
dainty little things, and most have brilliant yellows or orange mingled
with their olive-green and black plumage. They are not too hardy in
captivity, though we have kept the American Redstart, a gorgeous
beauty in salmon and glossy black, for over four years. The Hooded
Warbler has olive-green wings and tail, most of the head and chest
black, and the underparts, forehead, and cheeks rich yellow.
White-winged Whydah ( Coliuspasser albonotatus) . These are rather
unattractive members of a family which usually has brilliancy of
colour and decorative development of tail plumes. They are not
uncommon, but are new for us.
The above-mentioned species are all newcomers to our collection,
but in addition we have many more repeats or duplicates. They
include the American Egrets, handsomest of their genus, Jabiru,
glorious Roseate Spoonbills, New Zealand Sheldrakes, several species
of Pheasants, many shore birds including dainty Stilts and Avocets,
43 young born of six species of the parrot family. Quetzal, Ground
Hornbiil, Tanagers, and a host more of the commoner species often
seen in zoos.

HOMING BUDGERIGARS: THE START OF
THE SEASON 1952
</sectionHeader>

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds., England)
The breeding season in the homing Budgerigar aviary really began
earlier than I intended. A greywing mauve hen in the hen's resting
aviary had a slight illness, and after she had recovered, I decided to
tone her up by a short period at liberty, intending to return her to
the hen's aviary before she laid. However, she rushed into breeding
condition in about ten days, and I found she had already laid an
egg when I took down the box she had selected in order to carry her
back to her former abode. I therefore decided to leave her to it
though it looked like being a severe endurance test for her prospective
family. She had mated with a rather scrubby yellow/lutino cock
who had nearly died of coccidiosis the previous summer. It is not
easy to see on what principle hen Budgerigars select their mates.
They certainly do not always choose the bravest and strongest, as do
hen grouse, and they certainly do not always choose the most beautiful;
in fact, they display such a shocking disregard of the standards of the
Budgerigar Society that I have often thought of adorning the side of
the hen's aviary with the drawing of the Ideal Cock Budgerigar as a
sort of pin-up boy.
The greying mauve hen hatched five of her six eggs at the beginning
of the long spell of cold weather that began in January, but although
she had been a perfect mother to two large broods the previous
summer, she disgraced herself by becoming the worst plucker of
her young I have ever had. Why they did not succumb to the com-
bined effect of the cold and their mother's attentions, I cannot imagine,
nor do I know why she suddenly developed the vice, unless, when the
water was frozen in the early mornings she was thirsty, and their juicy
quills tempted her. When her family were due to leave the nest
I put her and them in a flight cage in the birdroom. The first to come
out--a lutino---died rather suddenly a couple of days later ; she
may not have fed it, but the rest were reared, though not good
specimens.
In order to try and obtain a few early youngsters to shorten the
rather dull period one gets in Spring with no young birds flying
before the May broods from March layings are on the wing, I turned
a non-exit opaline blue hen into the liberty aviary about the middle
of January. From many suitors of all ages she selected a young
green cock whose forehead was still largely barred. She laid five
eggs, but only one hatched, now a sturdy green youngster out of the
nest. About a fortnight later I introduced a yellow olive hen bred
the previous year. She selected as her mate an adult green cock who

is bossed by nearly all the other male birds in the aviary. A yellow
cock kept driving him off and offering himself as a substitute, but she
would have none of him and he finally had to retire well snubbed.
She laid six eggs, and at present has six youngsters nearly feathered--
four yellows and yellow-winged greens, one green, and a cobalt.
The previous summer I asked Mr. Hallstrom to send me a few
wild bush-bred Budgerigars, which he kindly did. They are smaller
than our birds, and their legs are not dark blue as some old writers
had declared them to be. (Is there a blue-legged local race ?) I
cannot see that they are any better green than our domestic greens.
Their spots vary. Some are very poor, but others are quite fair for
the size of the birds. The one cock I have in the liberty aviary,
though smaller than the domestic cocks, is master of them. When
he first went out he displayed much more intelligence in finding his
way about than the average aviary-bred bird (larger Parrakeets are
the same) and his morals appear superior, for he never tries to flirt
with other cocks' wives. He is, however, less tolerant of young
that do not belong to him than are domesticated cocks. The wild
hen to whom he was mated mysteriously disappeared while the aviary
was still closed to allow new birds to settle down, and he then paired
with an old green hen who mysteriously made her way to my aviaries
last summer, much the worse for the long period of close confinement
in a small cage from which she had clearly escaped. The main lot
of hens for the first round I put into the aviary about 15th February.
Most of them were homers, but there was one curiously-coloured
non-exit that had bred me some nice birds the previous summer ; a
new rainbow I had got from a dealer ; and the green hen already
mentioned. One homer, a lutino, got egg-bound, though the weather
was mild, and was taken off breeding. Another homer, a sea-green,
died egg-bound with her fifth egg, with very little warning. She was
all right the afternoon before, but dead the next morning. Strange
to say when only four months old she had laid her first clutch of
eggs, and hatched and reared the young in the middle of the awful
winter of 1950-1951. Now, after a full year's rest, she succumbed
in very warm weather for the time of year. The old green hen, who
I felt sure would get egg-bound, laid her clutch without trouble, and
now has young.
Most of the hens selected their nests without much quarrelling,
nearly all preferring those which faced north. An opaline
sea-green was inclined to be meddlesome round the yellow-olive's
nest, provoking a demonstration from that lady, until she removed
herself, but the worst trouble came from the rainbow and the old
green. I find that old hen Budgerigars that have bred in cages or
single-compartment aviaries are generally much more troublesome
than those who have been accustomed from the first to community

life. The sight of so many nests seems to go to their heads, and they
can neither make up their minds nor mind their own business.
The rainbow, after appearing to settle on two nests in succession,
only to desert them, planted herself in the box next the opaline blue.
This might not have been too bad if she had behaved herself, but
she insisted on glaring in a hostile fashion at her neighbour over the
partition between the boxes, and even went so far as to attack her
on the perch opposite her nest. The opaline blue was normally
a quiet bird who did not interfere with anyone, but there are some
things which make even the most easy-going people see red.
When I returned to the aviary after a brief absence, the clash had
occurred. The rainbow hen was hanging on to the end of a twig
looking very dazed and groggy, with several bites on her head and
one on her leg, while the opaline blue was flouncing up and down
the aviary, landing with a whop ! at alternate ends, head erect,
eyes blazing, and body rigid with indignation. She was in a towering
rage ! There she'd been, not saying a word to anyone, and that
miserable creature must needs come and insult and interfere with her
on her own doorstep ! She'd never heard of such a thing in all her
born days ! She&amp;apos;d teach her a lesson, and anyone else, too, who
tried the same game on her ! Her mate endeavoured to pacify her,
but with little effect. " There, there, my dear," he seemed to say,
" I'm sure you've driven her off and she won't worry us again. Let
me give you some food and then go back to Baby or he will catch
cold." But her reply evidently was, "You don't understand ; you
can't trust people like that. She might slip in and murder our child
when my back was turned. I won't have her next door ! I won't
have her at this end of the aviary at all ! I won't ! I won't ! ! I
won't ! ! ! " After some time she did go back to her nest, but no
sooner had she reached the bottom of the box than the memory of
her wrongs drove her out again to make a further demonstration.
I am not usually in favour of corporal punishment, but where people
with or without feathers who cannot mind their own business, are
concerned, I must admit it often does them a world of good ! When
she had recovered from her injuries, the rainbow hen slipped
quietly up to an untenanted box and hardly left it. The box,
as a matter of fact, was next the yellow-olive's, but so unassumingly
did she take possession of it, that she provoked no objection from
that rather touchy lady.
One would have thought that the discipline meted out to the
rainbow hen would have been a sufficient warning to other would-be
disturbers of the peace, but one more lesson was needed. The writer
of the Book of Proverbs comments on the way in which a plain girl
who at last gets married is liable to throw her weight about. It was
the same with the old green hen. Her new-found happiness in married

life, combined with the sight of so many nest-boxes, went to her
head, and she could not make up her mind where to settle down,
and would peer into other ladies' houses and tell them what a much
nicer husband she had than they ! The fact that this happened to be
true did not make her observations any more popular, and it was
only after receiving from the opaline blue a very bloody nose that she,
too, learned to keep that organ out of other people's affairs. When
she had been taught to obey the rules of decent society, peace
descended upon the aviary, and the opaline blue returned to her
domestic duties, and became as unobtrusive as before. One other
incident occurred about a fortnight later. An unmated greywing
mauve cock discovered a yellow-winged green hen in the hen's
aviary, and the couple seemed so devoted to each other that I brought
her up to the liberty aviary. Her fiance was of course delighted to
see her, and was most attentive throughout the morning, but alas !
at midday the faithless creature jilted him in favour of the yellow
cock who had been mated to the hen who plucked her young and
who had been removed. The poor greywing mauve was frantic
with annoyance, as well he might be, and showed his exasperation
by flapping his wings, as a cock Barraband will do when something
has happened to upset his domestic affairs. He tried to drive the
yellow cock away and bribe the faithless lady by feeding her, but it
was no good. She would actually still let him feed her and then
push him out of the way and run off to rub noses with the yellow
cock (when a Budgerigar hen rubs noses with a suitor it means that
she has accepted him), and let him feed her too ! I never saw such
a heartless proceeding nor one which demonstrated more clearly the
well-known danger of a girl getting engaged to the first man she sees
much of, before she has had the opportunity of meeting others !
The rather noisy disputes between the yellow-winged green's
suitors had a disturbing effect on the yellow-olive hen who left her
nest and began to flounce about and, in kitchen parlance, " create."
The yellow-winged green, though so unscrupulous in her love
affairs, was, however, a perfect lady in matters affecting rights of
property. Directly she discovered that a box already belonged to
someone else she removed herself at once, and she made it quite
plain that she would not intrude on the yellow-olive's box or even
on her corner of the aviary. She made it equally plain, however,
that she would stand no nonsense from anyone interfering with
her where she had a perfect right to go and, as she was a very big
and powerful bird--indeed the finest homer I have bred--the yellow-
olive soon decided that she had better stop making an unreasonable
fuss.

Some of my finches have been busy and have had a number of
young--Parson, Zebra (Common, Fawn, also White), Ribbon, Spice,
Fawn Silverbills, Blood, Grey Javas, White Javas, Red-billed Weavers,
Russ 3 Weavers, Rufous-necked Weavers, Cordon Bleu, Red-crested
Cardinals, and a number of others, including Mannikins, Waxbills,
and Buntings. My Lovebirds have been breeding too, Blue Masked,
Fischer's, Nyasaland, Masked, Peach-faced, Black-cheeked, and I
have some hybrids, Peach-faced X Masked, Fischer's X Nyasaland,
Fischer's X Black-cheeked, Abyssinian X Masked. My Pintailed
Nonpareils have bred. Very few here can keep them alive for more
than a few weeks. I have a large number of other birds which have
no partners, and nothing can be done about it, as dealers are not
permitted to import. I also have many which are true pairs, but
evidently they are a bit too modern and do not believe in settling
down. Or is it the housing shortage ? Maybe they want to be left
alone in their own homes. My Blue-winged Parrotlets do nothing
else but threaten each other and fight. Well, I suppose that's how it
is all over the world. Pairs of Blue-crowned Conures and Quaker
Parrakeets are, however, showing a little interest in breeding.
Recently I was quite amused when I saw a young Zebra Finch fed
in turn by a Bengalese and a Pintailed Nonpareil, and most sur-
prised when later it induced a Diamond Dove to give it a feed. It
was evidently managed somehow as the youngster seemed satisfied.
In April, 1951, I obtained three birds, the first time I have seen the
like, one almost completely red and the other two dark brown with
yellow rumps. I think they are Scarlet Grosbeaks (Haemotospiza sipahi ).
In September, one of the brown birds began to change colour, gradu-
ally, and is now completely golden-yellow. In October I noticed
a patch of yellow on the breast of the red bird, and in November it
was almost golden-yellow in colour. I suppose these two are cock
birds and will later change colour from yellow to red. The third
bird, which is still brown, must either be a hen or a young cock.
My White Cranes (Grus leucogeranus) are not doing too well. All of
them have swollen toe-joints due probably to the climate or something
lacking in the diet. I have noticed that even the one at the Zoo, two
which were purchased and shipped to America, also four other birds,
have or had the same trouble.

Bach's air, No. 3 Suite in D Major, was being played on the
gramophone the other day and a very persistent bird voice kept
coming through, which for the moment defeated me. Coming into
the room I saw it was a young cock Crossbill really letting go ; it was
quite a song and delightful. He is only this season's bird, and his
golden-green plumage has not yet displaced all the infant stripes.
His sister lives with him in a large box-like structure, 48 X 36 X 20
inches, and she is still very much in her nestling stripes, though
(30th August) shedding many feathers. I regret to say that she is one
of those girls who does not know her own mind: on occasions she is
charming to her brother and the next minute she will make a frightful
face at him and push him off a branch, she will snatch an almond or
a fir cone out of his beak in a most unladylike manner.
They are a charming couple and quite fearless. They have cedar
or some kind of fir branches to play on, and these are renewed fairly
often as they tear them to pieces. The staple food is a good parrot
mixture, and they have one or two almonds every day, with larch
cones and fir cones--these latter keep them much occupied. As the
autumn comes they will be offered berries of different kinds.
Early next spring they are going out into a large planted aviary,
and with suitably placed spruce and cedar branches we shall hope for
some home-grown Loxia curvirostra curvirostra. Last year the Editor was
kind enough to let me mention the Blackbird that went to school
and the Common Whitethroat. Both flourish. The Blackbird whistled
in his garden aviary through May and June, but not the glorious
Blackbird song but a rather vulgar cadence learned, I imagine, at his
prep, school. It began often at 3 a.m., and many who passed by came
in to say there was a strange bird in the garden. A small companion
was found for him in May. He was kind to it but now it is larger than
Tweet and rather to our dismay is moulting into a cock. We did so
hope it was going to be a comfort and a helpmeet.
The Whitethroat has just completed a lovely moult, and earwigs,
spiders, and crane hies, and the odd bluebottle have given him a
tremendous polish. He sang his harsh spring song till the end of June,
and any day now he will treat us to his sub-song, which is more
attractive than his love songs. Last winter he won a silver cup.
Next door to the Whitethroat lives a Tickell's Blue Flycatcher, a
gentleman whose confidence it is hard to win. Shy and supremely
active, his song is like a chime of little silver bells, and anyone who
happens to have a crane fly or grasshopper about them is more than
welcome. It is difficult to say at which of the two universities he was
educated.

THE REV. J. R. LOWE-NOTES FROM A RECTORY GARDEN IO 3
Edward must be mentioned. Edward is only a common Starling,
but full of charm and character, and becoming vastly handsome.
Spots appear as if by magic every day now. He started out into the
great wide world by being washed down some spouting in a rain-storm.
I regret to say some brothers and sisters were drowned but Edward
was just alive when found and never looked back. We heaved a sigh
of relief when he could manage his meals by himself, as he wanted
breakfast so terribly early. He coughs and sneezes rather, and we are
waiting patiently for Aniodol treatment, but twenty-one miles of
water seem to produce insuperable problems.
From April onwards I found myself paired to a hen Chaffinch.
Whenever I went into the aviary she spent all the time on me and
behaved in a most embarrassing manner as the season advanced. In
despair I got her a husband of her own kind. She made a beautiful
nest, incorporating small portions of a tweed coat of mine. She laid
four eggs and hatched three babies. But would she feed them ? Not
on your life. Her husband had lost his heart to a hen Canary, and his
method of courtship was so violent that the horrified Canary broke
into a soft moult and was useless for the rest of the season.
The cock Chaffinch was removed, but undeterred Mrs. Chaffinch
built another nest, laid three eggs, and sat on them for weeks, and so
attractive was I that if she saw me even outside the aviary she clung
to the wire, demanding some attention. Now in a deep moult she
prefers my shoulder or lap to a branch.
In the same aviary a pair of Goldfinches had three nests, and four
youngsters reared to maturity.
A hen Greenfinch laid twenty-one eggs, her husband was a Canary,
and all that effort produced only three birds that have reached
maturity. This couple have reared three young Greenfinches that
had left their nest too early.
In our small aviary a very tame hen Bullfinch lived with a cock
Canary. I had great hopes of this pair until a wild cock took up a
position outside and refused to budge. The hen Bullfinch's behaviour
was natural but tiresome. She fell desperately in love with the wild
gentleman. I removed the Canary, much to his relief, opened the
aviary door, in went the wild cock. In rather less than a week they
had built and five eggs appeared. Four young were hatched, one
reared for a week, and then they gave up. I opened the aviary and I
have an idea a family was raised over the garden wall.

By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
Despite the horribly cold and wintry weather which continued
well into May, we had a rather unexpectedly satisfactory 1951 breeding
season at Keston.
Among the larger parrakeets, Golden-mantled Rosellas and Lutino
mated to Lutino-bred Ringnecks did particularly well, and it is interest-
ing to note with the latter that the percentage of Lutinos they produce
does not remain anything like constant each season, though it probably
evens out over a number of years. In 1950, for instance, the various
pairs produced an unusually large proportion of Lutinos, which was
offset this season by a predominance of Greens. A hen Alexandrine
X Lutino Ringneck hybrid mated to her brother did not go to nest,
and their brother was put with a supposed young hen Alexandrine,
which however moulted out as a cock. This hybrid is now mated to
a true hen Alexandrine and it will be interesting to see what they
produce next season.
A fair number of Stanleys, Redrumps, and Cockatiels were reared,
and a pair of Mealies, who pluck their young ones in the nest, pro-
duced a small brood which were only slightly plucked on the back.
The old pair of Pileated Parrakeets had six eggs in their first nest,
two of which they hatched and lost when about a fortnight old.
However, they laid again at once, this time rearing three nice young
ones, and of the six young ones they reared in 1950 the Duke of
Bedford has two pairs at Woburn. I don't consider them at all easy
to sex when young, and the two I kept both turned out to be cocks.
At first I thought this year's three young ones were two hens and a
cock, but when I tried mating them to last season's young cocks (now
in full adult plumage) it became apparent I was wrong and that
they were two cocks and a hen, so, including the parents, we now
have two pairs and three odd cocks.
The old pair are not in the least destructive to the woodwork of
their aviary, but all their children are--terribly so. However, it is
well worth having to cover exposed woodwork with wire-netting, as
Pileated have so much beauty and personality and are such very
entertaining and individual parrakeets.
A pair of Roseate Cockatoos reared three very nice young ones, and
a hen Blue-fronted Amazon, one of a brood of five bred here in 1939,
reared four fine young ones, her previous clutches with previous
husbands having always proved infertile. This brood is of par-
ticular interest, as they must be the first brood of second generation
aviary-bred Amazons ever reared in confinement.

The hen had plucked them slightly on the back, but they soon grew
these feathers and were excellent young ones, very strong on the wing
even their first day out of the nest. They fledged with a fairly long
interval between each, the youngest and last to come out being--as
seems always the case with a brood of Amazons--rather smaller than
its brothers and sisters. However, it was a nice little bird, and
Miss Knobel, when she came down to see them, took a great fancy
to it and bought it.
A second pair of Amazons consist of a hen Yellow-fronted obtained
in 1950, mated to a cock Blue-front which Miss Knobel found for us
in a London shop, and which only arrived in the spring and, being
very cage-cramped and out of breath at the slightest exertion, could
hardly be expected to be fertile, until he had spent a year or two in
an aviary. I think he is an old bird, but he has the purest yellow
shoulder patches of any Blue-fronted I have ever seen--pure primrose
yellow with scarcely a vestige of red. The hen Yellow-front is a
charming bird, and would make a delightful pet, as she is extremely
tame and gentle and loves being handled. Rather to my surprise she
went to nest as soon as she was given a box, but being very out of
practice, she achieved only two very strange-looking eggs;--one extra
large and shaped like an hour-glass, and the other quite round and
the size of a pea ! She was, however, very proud of them, and sat
on them for weeks until I finally had both them and the nest box
removed.
A third pair of Amazons did not go to nest.
Young were reared by Masked and Fischer's which are the only
Lovebirds we have at present.
Of Finches, a number of Common, Silver, Fawn, and White Zebra
Finches were reared, as well as Bengalese ; a few Gouldians ; and a
brood of young Long-tailed Grass Finches. I thought the latter
rather interesting, as the parents reared them without mealworms or
live food of any kind, entirely on seed and green food and ryegrass.
The usual vast quantities of Budgerigars numbering several thousand,
were bred, in all the infinite (and, to me, bewildering !) present-day
range of colours and colour varieties. New varieties which we have
added to our breeding stock are Crested Budgerigars and Harlequins.
The latter have a spotted appearance which reminds one rather of
a Dalmatian Carriage Dog, and though they are very distinctive,
they strike me as being quaint rather than beautiful, but they certainly
make a complete contrast to all other colour varieties. The Crested
Budgerigars have a crest in the sense that a Crested Norwich Canary has.
Thirteen young Turquoisines were reared, and this, with last
season's seventeen, makes a total of thirty young Turquoisines reared
from a nucleus of three imported specimens--a pair and an odd cock--
received towards the end of the summer of 1949.

mated for want of something more suitable, to a cock Budgerigar, laid
and incubated two clutches of infertile eggs. At first I thought there
might be a brood of very unusual hybrids, as the Budgerigar con-
tinually fed his Bourke's wife and was most attentive to her, but nothing
came of it, and it seems that it is quite impossible to cross a Budgerigar
with any other parrakeet. I believe a Budgerigar is said, on one
occasion, to have hybridized with a Peach-faced Lovebird, but I must
confess I have always taken this assertion with a great many grains of
salt, as, of all the matings that have been tried, it seems to me quite
the most unlikely to prove successful.
One thing that may militate against successfully producing a hybrid
with a Budgerigar as one parent is the male's curious courtship
display, which consists of first sitting on one side of the hen, then
giving her several sharp biffs in the face, before flying rapidly round
to repeat the performance on the other side ! This is so unlike the
pre-nuptial display of any of the grass parakeets (which are nearest
to Budgerigars in size) that it is perhaps hardly to be wondered at
if they resent this cave-man stuff, although the above-mentioned hen
Bourke's was prepared to put up with it--provided her Budgerigar
husband duly fed her afterwards !
The rarest bird on the farm, a male Double-eyed Dwarf Parrot,
Cyclopsittacus diopthalmus , which the Duke of Bedford asked me to house
for him, and which is still very flourishing, is quite the most enchanting
little bird imaginable.
Roughly speaking he is green, paler and yellow beneath, and with
red and blue areas and touches of orange on the head. His eyes are
large and brown and extremely intelligent and his black beak is large
and powerful for his size.
Although he is only about the size of a Nyasa Lovebird, he is a true
miniature parrot, possessing all the charm and intelligence of the
larger parrots. He can move very quickly, and like some Lorikeets
jumps when excited quickly along the perch, turning in mid-air,
facing first one way and then the other ! He can also creep along
a perch in the usual parrot hand-over-foot manner, but with extreme
slowness, so that, although he is actually moving all the time, you
hardly realize he is in motion at all. What the purpose of this stealthy
movement may be I have no idea, but I have certainly never observed
it in any other bird.
He will take food from my fingers, and normally his voice is rather
squeaky, but if you have passed his aviary and he thinks he is being
neglected, he can create a really terrific harsh screeching din, out of
all proportion to his size, in order to attract attention to himself.
Although he shows no sign of talking, he is an excellent mimic of other
birds, and imitates most cleverly in his small voice the excited alarm

note of Brown's Parrakeets (a pair of which occupy the aviary behind
his) and also the morning and evening cries of Ringnecks, and it is
quaint to hear such a tiny bird imitating the cries of other birds,
many times its own size.
At first I thought he would prove delicate, and housed him in a
flight cage in a heated birdroom for the winter, but this caused him
to start feather-plucking, so I put him out as soon as possible the
following spring. Actually he has proved extremely hardy, and has
spent the whole of the past winter in an unheated outdoor aviary,
being, of course, shut into the double-wooded shelter each night.
Apart from ordinary parrot food, I give him a small piece of bread
soaked in sweetened watered milk twice a week, as well as plenty of
sweet ripe apple, which he adores, and also green food of which he
is particularly fond of the stalks of seakale beet.
A mate for him was sent over from Australia, but very unfortunately
died at Woburn during the winter, in spite of the fact that it was kept
in a large flight cage in a heated birdroom.
I started to write this article at the end of 1951, but for various
reasons I couldn't finish it, so am doing so now (March, 1952). During
last spring we obtained several Jackson's Whydahs, which strike
me as being temperamentally quite different to other Whydahs, as
they are extremely tame and intelligent and the cock of our pair
will take mealworms from my fingers, though the hen is shyer. They
are also aggressive to other birds and terribly destructive (as I know
to my cost !) to growing shrubs--even Euonymous--in a planted
aviary. Even out of colour, however, they are, to my mind, quite the
most attractive of the Whydahs, and I remember, in my youth, seeing
them in full colour at the Zoo, with their extraordinary tail which,
in miniature, so exactly resemble that of a domestic cock. My male
sang a great deal during the winter, and came into a sort of semi-
colour, getting much blacker, but he has just moulted and reverted
to the brown plumage which resembles that of the female, which
makes me rather wonder whether these Whydahs do not, perhaps,
come into full colour until they are two or three years old.
Four young Grey Singing Finch X Canary hybrids were reared,
and look very like a large Grey Singing Finch with a touch of yellow
on the breast. They are, however, the loveliest songsters imaginable.
They proved to be one hen and three cocks, and the latter are all
singing now most beautifully. Their song is as continuous as that
of a Skylark, and curiously like it, but with unmistakable Canary notes
interspersed, and, when resting and taken notice of, they utter the
typical " Sweet ! " of a Canary. They are very neat and lively little
birds and quite tame. We have mated the hen to one of the cocks
to try and find out if the hybrid is a fertile one.

By Peter J. Panting, B.Sc. (Goodwick, Pembrokeshire, Wales)
Of the many birds I have had the opportunity of keeping and
studying, Margaret takes pride of place. As a schoolboy, in May,
1946, I brought home a cold and deserted young Magpie--a state
due probably to the constant visits of the local youth to the nest.
It had pin-feathers but little life, though it revived in a warm nest
of hay in a box, sufficiently to take a little nourishment. As I was
in school her dietary needs were mainly attended to by my mother--
who fortunately understands baby birds and their needs. On a potion
of bread and milk, with egg, minced meat, and various fresh insect
offerings, Maggie grew and throve. She was kept in a shed, where
numerous other animals also lived (and still do), and an insulating
pad of cotton wool served to keep her warm at night. It was not
long before a cheerful little bird (with a sorely truncated tail !) was
hopping about the shed--and making a frightful mess of the place !
I hadn't meant to keep her, so as soon as she was flying strongly the
wire door of the shed was left open. She went out, but not far !
As soon as her benefactors appeared she would fly to them for
sustenance.
In a lathed-in space over the wire door an opening was made,
with a little door to fit it and a perch to alight on. This was
" Maggie's door ", a convenience which took little time to be put to
good use. I had earlier fitted an old pigeon-ring for her identification.
Her companion was an old Jackdaw, who had been ignominously
swept down a chimney, with two " brothers ", some years before.
Jackie had a stiff wing, due to his unfortunate descent at such a
tender age, and could not fly--and hence could not be let out except
under supervision. They got on fairly well together, but occasionally
fought. They would bathe in company, and both devoured swarming
ants with great avidity.
Maggie attached herself to the Pigeons, whose loft was nearby.
She would fly around with them, getting hopelessly left behind as she
grew older. She would perch on roofs and chimneys after a while,
but preferred next door's apple trees and some adjacent pines, but
always roosted on her perch in the shed and her little door was closed.
She would come when called, even from a housetop, to perch on
head or arm, quite unafraid and expecting no tangible reward.
When autumn came Maggie got her adult plumage, glossy and
resplendent--and a full-length tail. From then on she was
immaculate and beautiful always. She bathed often with the
Pigeons, pulling their tails until they left their bath, though they
did not fear her. Also she would suck their eggs, if left unattended,
but this was seldom. She was often in their loft, but a sitting bird

would keep her at bay ; or would tweak the cats' tails, to their great
annoyance, and rob the dog, who sneaked away, growling, from a
bone at her audacious approach. Usually daily visits were paid to
the scullery and kitchen to examine everything ; she being very fond
of fresh milk, would remove protective saucers or muslin covers with
squawks of delight, to filch the cream, and would sit on the sink,
watching my mother prepare vegetables, for hours. In the dining-
room, when the window was open, her strength would be tried at
carrying away any object fancied, but she was hardly strong enough
for most. Once she did take a silver serviette ring, which I managed
to take from her (about a month later !) as she was rolling it down
the inclined garden path, snatching it as it reached the bottom !
For once I was too quick for her. It was filthy and had apparently
been kept in a damp place, or buried. She did not find it
again !
Several of her cc treasure houses " came to light at different times.
They contained rounded pebbles, pieces of glass, silver paper, fruit
stones, and such small items mainly, though she was quite fond of
coloured paper, in small pieces. She was very cautious about hiding
these properties but would let me watch her conceal food, in crevices
in walls as a rule, stuffing up the aperture with grass and earth
with great cunning. How she loved spiders--we would call her
whenever we found one in the shed, and she would eagerly chase
cabbage white butterflies, one of her few useful pursuits.
Food worried her but little ; bread and milk she usually scorned
when adult ; minced meat would be taken, and dead mice were
great ! She would wait for hours to catch these unfortunates, which
were usually present in the shed. Her liberty was never curtailed.
She was usually in when the weather was bad and her door was only
shut at night against cats, as a rule, but she never minded if shut in.
Should I be eating anything when she was about, with a sudden
swoop through the air she would attempt to snatch it. Often I was
taken by surprise, and she succeeded, but I remember her disgust at
a sticky piece of pink nougat !
All Magpies seem to be thieves : she managed to get hold of several
articles--'including a bunch of small keys--which were never found,
to our confusion. Flower petals, particularly marigolds, were another
item apparently worth gathering. She used to bring these in, on
times, and present them to the Jackdaw, whose cage door was always
opened (by himself!). What these gifts were for I cannot fathom.
She would often manipulate her aluminium ring, but never pulled
at it.
Jackie could whistle and " meow " to deceive any cat, but Maggie
was no vocalist. She would sit quietly and make a subdued chattering,
exactly like a Budgerigar, for long periods. I cannot think what this

meant, for nobody in the locality had a Budgie then and I have never
heard such notes recorded in the Magpies' natural repertoire.
Maggie could be picked up by the only part of her which she
allowed to be held--her beak ! Lifting bodily by this member
perturbed her not in the least ! She would allow her head to be
tickled, as so many birds will, but refused any further liberties with
her person. She was surprisingly light.
Sitting still in cold weather, she would alter her appearance entirely
by puffing out her rump feathers into a voluminous grey mass. This
was done, to a lesser extent, when she went to sleep at night. Always
she showed no fear of people, whether previously known or not, and
her trust was never betrayed. Everyone who saw Maggie--and they
were many--loved and were fascinated by her and her " taking
ways "--the latter usually literal.
The local gardens were not her boundary ; a large elm (now, alas,
felled) on the village square was a popular vantage point. I have
seen her--she would always squawk to me--half a mile and more
away from the house, and would come down when called, to perch
on my shoulder for as long as she cared. I only once remember her
utter the so well-known alarm call, which was when a strange cat
sprang at her (and fortunately missed), which seems very remarkable.
In the winter of 1946 she was lost in a snowstorm, and was gone
for nearly two days ; but she appeared on an old building near our
house as I was going to school on the second morning, and was home
within a few minutes. By this time she had a mate. This bird, a wild
one, would follow her to the garden and walk about on the shed roof,
but would not venture down to the perch and door, and flew away
at the least alarm. One frosty morning there were four Magpies in
our garden and the next--right in the middle of the village, which
was unusual, to say the least. She must have inspired some con-
fidence ! This mate was somewhat larger than Maggie.
Autumn of 1947 saw me in the Army. For several weeks Maggie
wandered a lot. She was hardly ever seen in the garden, but she
soon resumed her old habits. On my first leave the greatest welcome
I received, perhaps, was from my Magpie, who followed me or sat
on my shoulder for as long as possible during the few days I spent
at home. Luckily for her I was in the garden for most of the time.
Before long she got used to these comings and goings, accepting them
with apparent resignation.
She was never a very spiteful bird. My ferrets were feared, and
would not be closely approached when they were exercising in the
garden. Although she would enter the Angora rabbits' hutches
(through the mangers) the babies were never touched, and the rabbits
seemed not to resent her presence. Neither did I ever know her to
touch a young Pigeon, but as the fond mothers of these helpless

morsels guard them pretty closely in their early days, the opportunity
probably did not occur. Small birds--Sparrows and the like--were
often chased (but never, apparently, harmed) when they came too
near.
In April, 1948, my mother wrote to say Maggie had not been
home for a week. On a night of very high winds someone (later
discovered) had entered the shed and frightened her into flying out--*
probably in attempting to catch her. Next morning the big door was
open and she was gone. We never saw her again. Our beautiful,
beloved bird had left us . . . for ever.
There is a sequel : about three weeks later a " Do you know ? 55
column in a local paper bore the following : " A dead magpie,
bearing a ring, N.U.R.P. 31. LSC. 475, was found by Mr. D. Carey
Evans while working at St. Dogmael's Abbey ruins." It was brought
to my notice by someone who didn't even know that I had a Magpie
but just that I was interested in birds. My hopes fell on reading it,
for we thought she still lived, and would return.
St. Dogmael's Abbey is some 16 miles away, straight across the
sea--the southern end of Cardigan Bay. My poor, frightened little
bird, what fears did she know, blown across the open sea on such
a wild night ? Magpies are never powerful flyers--though her graceful
form, swooping through a clear sky, had so often gladdened my eyes
as she dived and turned. She must have died, on this distant
promontory, probably from exposure--for she could cater for herself.
A letter to the paper brought her ring and a note from her finder.
He was very interested, being fond of birds himself. The body was
decomposed when found, so he could not state the cause of death.
All I have now is a few moulted tail feathers and the ring to remind
me of the fullest picture I have had of a bird and its life, carefree and
untrammelled. She taught me more about birds than any book possibly
could, and I hope that this short sketch of two happy years will interest
other bird lovers. As I stand in the garden on sunny mornings even
now, four years later, her memory is so vivid that I still half expect
to hear a cheerful low squawk of greeting, to turn and find her sitting
expectantly nearby, ready to sit on my shoulder, to nibble my ear,
or gently pull my hair as she so often did in those blessed days when
she was with us.

the two young Regent Bower Birds pictured in the Avtcultural
Magazine, 1951, 94. The young cock died but the hen is in perfect
fettle and at the time was building. Unfortunately she attacked and
almost blinded her mate and naturally the Doctor does not feel like
risking his other cock with her in case the same fate befalls him.
A pair of Glossy Starlings, a few Cardinals, Weavers, two Javas, and
about a dozen Satin Bower Birds complete the collection."

The spring nesting has commenced and the old breeding pair of
New Zealand Sheld-duck has launched a brood of nine.
The Cornish Choughs which have laid in previous years have two
eggs, and many of the regular breeders among the pheasants and
waterfowl are now nesting.
The Fraser's Eagle-Owl and Emu eggs proved to be infertile, but
the Great Eagle-Owls have three young ones.
New arrivals include a fine pair of Great Condors ( Vultur gryphus ) ;
two young Chilean Eagles ( Geranocetus melanoleucus) ; a Red-tailed
Buzzard--the western form Buteo borealis calurus --a pair of Bronzy
Sunbirds ( Nectarinia kilimensis ) ; three Kenya Double-collared Sun-
birds ( Cinnyris m. mediocris ) ; two more of the Scarlet-tufted Malachite
Sunbirds which, being new to aviculture, will be described later,
and a Juba Purple-banded Sunbird ( Cinnyris bifasciatus chalcomelas )--*
a sub-species new to the collection.
Two tame British birds, a Lesser Whitethroat ( Sylvia c. curruca) and
a Nightingale ( Luscinia m. megarhyncha) have been presented.
Dr. Windecker, on his way from Recife to Dusseldorf with a fine
collection of Brazilian birds, which included some sixty Humming
Birds, very kindly presented two Pygmy Hermit (Bhathornis r. ruber) ;
three Blue-breasted Sapphire ( Chlorestes n. notatus) and one which
appears to be Hylocharis lactea ; also one Superb Manakin ( Chiroxiphia
p. pareola) and a pair of Yellow-winged Sugar-birds ( Cyanerpes cyaneus).
A pair of Greater Patagonian Conures ( Cyanoliseus byroni) have been
deposited. This is one of the most handsome of all the Conures, and
one not seen in this country for a very long time.

metallic green, blue, black, or purple ". A map of the area dealt
with shaded to show where all the birds mentioned are common or
may be found, and where 75 per cent are to be found, is also provided.
In the description of each bird reference to Dr. Austin Robert's Birds
of South Africa is given, and suggestions made for ornithological works
for further reading. The English and Latin names of each species are
included, and a list of vernacular names added which will be of
special assistance to visitors to the Union. There are a number of
black and white drawings and four colour plates in each book.
Further books in this useful series are awaited with interest.

JOURNEYS). By Rolf Dirgksen. C. Bertelsmann Verlag,
Gutersloh, Germany. Price 9.80 DM.
The migration of birds has always been an entrancing subject,
and Rolf Dircksen's delightful and comprehensive book, Bird Folk on
Far Journeys , does it full justice. Written in a readable and vivacious
style, the book contains an enormous amount of information. Mr.
Dircksen is a first-rate field observer ; from a child he was fascinated
by bird migration which he watched from his home on the North Sea,
and during later years he had opportunity of pursuing his study of the
subject in many different places.
The author opens with a chapter expounding the wonder of bird
migration and continues with a detailed description of the various
methods of catching and ringing birds, how recoveries are reported,
and so on. Full accounts of behaviour on migration, routes, etc., of
many different species are given, ranging from Storks to Goldcrests.
The author then discusses many aspects of bird migration such as
height of flight on migration, dangers en route, orientation, whether
knowledge of routes is inherited, the origin of migration, and
many other points. He also gives a description of the German bird
observatories and notes on migration in North Asia, Japan, and
America.
The book is profusely illustrated with 36 maps and 93 magnificent
photographs, of which 10 are by Eric Hosking. A most entrancing
series of three photographs show how a nesting Oystercatcher is
caught and ringed by placing a wire trap over the eggs, which the
bird, nothing daunted, calmly enters and broods the eggs, apparently
quite content to be surrounded by a wire enclosure ! Even those who
cannot read German will wish to possess this book for its many
beautiful photographs.

Stalking Birds with Color Camera. By Dr. Arthur A. Allen,
Professor of Ornithology at Cornell University ; edited by
Gilbert Grosvenor, President, National Geographic Society.
Washington, D.C. : National Geographic Society, 329 pages,
1951- $ 7 - 5 *-
On rare occasions a birdbook will reach this reviewer's desk about
the merits of which he can wax genuinely enthusiastic--without
running the risk of indulging in overpraise. Dr. Allen's latest publica-
tion is such a work. It offers the bird-loving public coloured illustra-
tions of such excellent quality and in such profusion that it cannot
help being amazed at the author's patience and ingenuity--and great
success over the years. Assuredly, this exceptionally handsome
volume is eloquent testimony to Dr. Allen's profound interest in, and
lively enthusiasm for, his very difficult and trying task.
Three hundred and thirty-one illustrations in natural colours
depicting two hundred and sixty-six species of North American birds,
and numerous supplementary coloured as well as black-and-white
pictures, many of them occupying half and full pages, constitute the
bulk of this book--and such attractive and alluring bulk !
The twelve text chapters relate in a lively personal-experience
style of writffig important aspects of modern colour photography as
they are met with in the field of operation. They supplement,
appropriately, the illustrative portions of the work, greatly enhancing
their value to the reader. All this profusion of material has been
arranged artistically and reproduced faithfully. Many a reader will
wonder how so much beauty in natural colours--beauty about birds--
can be offered at so reasonable a price. Any lover of fine bird books
will treasure Stalking Birds with Color Camera as one of his truly valuable
possessions. Carl Naether.

I have recently acquired a young specimen from Mr. W. J. C. Frost. Its habitat
is Mysore Island, off the Bay of Geelvink, north coast of Papua. It is a very lovely
and lively bird. I feed it on Mellins' Food, on Allenburys Baby Food, dates, honey,
and condensed milk. I keep a bath in its cage because all Lorys are liable to mess
their plumage owing to their liquid diet. I once had a very old bird of this species
which died in the Parrot House, Regent's Park, in the war year of 1943. This
species is represented in the birdroom of the Natural History Museum, London,
by two specimens. My old bird is in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter,
Devon. The British Museum Catalogue of Birds, volume xx, gives this description
of Rosenberg's Lorikeet : Adult: back, wings, and tail green ; head blue, towards
the occiput purple ; a narrow red band on the occiput ; another yellowish-green
band, sometimes mingled with red, on the nape ; interscapular feathers with con-
cealed red bands ; breast and lower abdomen red, with dark blue bands on the edges
of the feathers ; middle of the abdomen dark blue ; flanks yellowish green, with
dark green bands ; under tail-coverts yellowish green, with green spots at the tip ;
under wing coverts and quills at the base of the inner web, red ; inner web of the
lateral tail-feathers yellowish green ; bill orange-red ; feet dark. Total length
11 inches; wing 4.80 ; tail 4.12 ; bill 0.85 ; tarsus 0.65. P. H. Maxwell.

A VISIT TO CORSICA IN 1951
By G. S. Webb (London, England)
Corsica needs no introduction as an island of beauty. In April
and May it is particularly lovely with flowering Cistus (rock roses)
dominating the landscape and giving off a delicate fragrance that
seems to linger in one's nostrils long after leaving the island.
The north-west coastal region, with its mountains and streams, and
rocky shores studded here and there with delightful sandy beaches,
can compare with anything of the kind anywhere in the world. Com-
bined with this natural beauty there is an air of peacefulness which
makes Corsica the ideal place for escape from the hectic life of our
cities.
The island--steeped in Napoleonic tradition--is blessed with
a salubrious climate and is lapped by the clear waters of the Mediter-
ranean, which yield enormous quantities of lobsters for shipment to
the Riviera and France. The other more or less natural wealth
comes from olives, chestnuts, and goats. For a long period under
Genoese domination, the Corsicans still speak an Italian patois among
themselves, but quickly revert to French when discoursing with
tourists and other foreign elements. One of the great charms of the
island is its sparse population (away from the few towns) and the
opportunities one has of lying on some delightful deserted beach being
pickled in the sun, while gazing on some distant snow-capped
mountain.
Corsica is nowadays within easy reach of London, as within a few
hours of London Airport one can be at Nice, from where it is a simple
matter to do the hundred mile voyage by sea or plane to one of several
points on the island. Periodically a boat goes direct from Nice to
Calvi, which is worth linking up with as this lands one at a renowned
beauty spot. Calvi's quaint and picturesque harbour is dominated
by an old Genoese fort and a delightful sandy beach fringed with
pine trees stretches for miles. As a background to this there are
Cistus-covered hills and distant snow caps.
The birds of Corsica are fairly numerous if one includes the large

variety of winter visitors which nearly all disappear by late April
and May. There are also a number of migrants from Africa which
use the island merely as a halting place, and after a few days move to
the mainland to breed. There are, however, a few migrants from
Africa which spend the summer in Corsica. The resident birds are
very interesting, though many of them are merely geographical races
of well-known British and Continental species. When sub-specifica-
tion is based on such things as greater or lesser wing measurement,
such differences can hardly be apparent in the field, but there are
quite a number of Corsican birds which can be seen to differ con-
siderably at first glance from the same species inhabiting our own
shores. Of these the Common Jay and some of the Tits are the most
noticeable.
Spring in Corsica in the year 1951, as elsewhere in Europe, was late
in arriving ; the local inhabitants reckoned it to be one of the coldest
in living memory. For this reason there were few signs of breeding
activities in early May.
Almost certainly the first land birds to be seen will be Goldfinches,
as these frequent the trees lining the main street of Calvi, and in fact
are the commonest birds in the island. In any open places they are
particularly numerous and can often be seen feeding in company with
Citril Finches (Spinus citrinella) which are also very plentiful. The
latter are no less striking than goldfinches and remind one somewhat
of the Cape Canary.
Warblers are most interesting though difficult to identify in the
thick scrub until one has become familiar with them. Perhaps the
most numerous is the Sardinian Warbler ( Sylvia melanocephalo ) which
is resident. This bird, with its black cap, can be confused with the
Black-cap Warbler (S. atricapilla )--also numerous--but its white
underparts are the best distinguishing feature in the field. I had
momentary glimpses of many warblers that I was unable to identify
with certainty, but on a few occasions got a clear view of the Dartford
Warbler (, S . undata) and Marmora's Warbler (S. sarda) and, of course,
the Fesser Whitethroat. While collecting Savigny's Tree Frogs in the
swamps near Calvi, I frequently heard the lively song of Cetti's Warbler
(\0x25A0Cettia cetti ) which is plentiful though not easy to see. It gives vent
to its song as a rule from the middle of a dense thicket bordering the
swamps.
Of the Turdidae, Blackbirds are seen sparingly in spring and are
among the few that remain to breed. In winter they are so numerous
that " Chasse aux merles " is one of the local sports. No thrushes
were encountered though these also are common winter visitors. To
me the most interesting of this family were the Blue Rock Thrushes
(Monticola solitarius). Corsica is very rich in rock scenery and at
Piana the landscape with its deep ravines and eroded rocks of fantastic

shapes is a wonderful setting for these birds. It is a common sight to
see a solitary specimen perched motionless for a long period on some
prominent boulder.
The most prevalent birds in this locality were Crag Martins ( Riparia
rupestris ) some of which were nesting. Elsewhere, in certain open
situations where there were low bushes and grass, Stonechats were
seen, but they do not remain at low altitudes for long in the spring ;
as the weather gets warmer they go higher to breed.
On the hillside at Calvi Hoopoes were fairly common and could
be heard on all sides. In this locality, there were also Golden Orioles.
I saw European Bee-eaters only once at Calvi, but further west on the
road to Ajaccio they were fairly numerous, sitting on the telegraph
wires and occasionally hawking flying insects.
The local Sparrow--common in the towns--is the Italian species
(Passer italic) which differs from P. domesticus by its chestnut upper
parts, including the nape and the crown, and by its apparently whiter
cheeks and ear coverts. Other common seed-eaters are the Greenfinch
and Chaffinch.
I never saw the European Starling, though it is a common winter
visitor. I understand they move northwards in February or March.
The Unicolor Starling (S. unicolor) is resident, and I saw quite a few
at Calvi, though not in flocks.
The Hooded Crow (C. cornix sardinius) is common and resident,
and is a conspicuous bird in open coastal regions. Carrion Crows
were also seen, and at Calvi about a mile from the town on the
municipal garbage heap I had the satisfaction of seeing the two
species together. The sight was certainly a memorable one for here
in one large assembly were dogs, pigs, fowls, Carrion and Hooded
Crows, all feeding happily within a few feet of one another. I cannot
say if Carrion Crows breed in Corsica--they are supposed to be
merely winter visitors--but they were there on 12th May. It is
supposed to be the rule that where these two species overlap they
interbreed, so in Corsica there is either an exception to this rule or
else the Carrion Crows I saw were late in departing. When not
feeding the two species kept apart. As already pointed out, the
season was one of the latest in living memory, so perhaps this occurrence
has no significance. Ravens were also seen and are apparently
resident, though not numerous.
Shrikes are fairly plentiful in open country, the commonest being
the Red-backed Shrike {Lanius collurio) though the Woodchat Shrike
(L. senator) is conspicuous in certain localities. Both these could be
seen perched on bushes waiting to pounce on grasshoppers, etc.
The Spotted Flycatcher ( Muscicapa striata) is in fair numbers and
appears to be resident whereas the Pied Flycatcher ( M . hypoleuca)
seen in late April seemed to have disappeared by the second week

in May. In the mountain forests around Vizzavona, the highest
point reached by the railway that traverses the island from Ajaccio
to Bastia, a race of the Common Wren is fairly plentiful. Here in the
pine trees Tits were very noticeable and included the Great, Blue
and Coal Tits. Up here the snow-covered mountains seemed only
a few hundred feet above us and the nights were bitterly cold. The
only Woodpecker seen was the Great Spotted.
One of the most delightful places in Corsica is the village of Porto,
situated among magnificent mountain scenery alongside a rocky
stream and less than a mile from the sea. Here the Crag Martin
was very numerous, and as already mentioned was nesting a few miles
away up on the rocks of Piana. Occasionally at Porto one saw in a
single congregation Crag Martins, White-bellied or Alpine Swifts
(.Micropus melba) and House Martins, all whirling through the air
together catching insects.
Rock Doves (Columba livid) were numerous here and could often be
seen swooping down into ravines in small flocks--their white rumps
being very conspicuous.
Birds of prey were in evidence, especially in more open situations
bordering steep woody or rocky hills. A race of the Common Buzzard
was noticeable at Calvi and when in flight seemed nearly always to be
mobbed by Hooded Crows. Kestrels and Common Kites were also
plentiful here. In the bay at Calvi Herring Gulls were much in
evidence though other sea birds were scarce. On one occasion I saw
six Shags together.
To see anything like the total number of resident or visiting birds
in Corsica, one would have to travel a much wider field than was
possible on a short holiday, as the country is of considerable size and
varies tremendously. Down the east coast there is a long line of lakes
and swamps which abound in waterfowl and waders, etc., but I had
no time to visit these.

By E. N. T. Vane (Great Missenden, Bucks, England)
Last year a few notes were contributed under the above heading
in the hope that they might interest other keepers of Parrot-like birds.
From subsequent conversations at meetings and elsewhere it is evident
that some members have at least read them. I am therefore prompted
to offer a few more, particularly so when our Secretary in his recent
most valuable book on Parrot Breeding Records goes so far as to state
on at least two occasions " bred by Vane . . . but not recorded " as
there are one or two other instances which he has not heard about
even yet. In passing, the first observation I would like to make is
that in the early days of the Avigultural Magazine almost any
opinion expressed in one issue was certain to be refuted, contested, or
ridiculed in the correspondence columns of the subsequent number by
more than one reader. Is it laziness that leaves our correspondence
section so inert ? Probably to-day it would be rephrased as apathetic
lethargy or lethargic apathy.
During the post-war years Manycolours have done very well in my
aviaries, yet they were once regarded as a hopeless proposition for
breeding or even keeping alive. Lord Tavistock's book reports that
they are subject to septicaemia and septic fever in certain districts
and hopeless to keep alive. This was, of course, written many years
ago and, taken in conjunction with the phrase "in certain districts",
I feel confident that these two diseases were, in fact, only some form
of what to-day is called caecal coccidiosis. This is deadly enough, but
in domestic poultry scientific research has discovered that it can be con-
trolled or neutralized by the use of sulpha drugs.
This brings us to two interesting items for consideration. First, the
use of these drugs for aviary birds and, secondly, the question of
moveable flights. Again, in my opinion we come up against the
individual bird. In literature published on coccidiosis there are many
conflicting statements and theories put forward. With different birds
kept under identical conditions some appear to be immune to disease,
others are particularly susceptible, some victims are quite unable to
resist the disease whilst others respond very rapidly to sulpha drug
treatment. Very briefly, the coccidia start their life cycle in one bird
from which they must emerge into the open air before being picked
up by another bird which becomes its host in its lethal stage. It may
be accepted that coccidiosis is very prevalent in poultry and also in
wild birds, consequently it is easily spread and may occur in any

aviary at any time, the objective therefore is to try and make one's
stock immune to infection.
Immunity can be achieved under certain conditions by the use of
sulphamezathine. For the drug to be effective it is necessary that the
birds under treatment be actually infected, as it is the coccidia
themselves that develop the immunity not the drug or the bird.
Moreover, the use of the drug on an uninfected bird may result in
the individual developing a resistance to the beneficial effect of the
drug if and when the coccidia eventually do enter the bird's system.
Correct diagnosis is consequently of exceptional importance, the
only reliable method being by microscopic examination of the excreta
in a laboratory. Even this is not infallible as I am informed that
under certain stages of development it is possible to obtain a negative
result from an infected case. One reads that the symptoms to look
for are general debility and mopiness, diarrhoea, and even blood
discharge in the droppings. I should imagine that any such case
would be beyond treatment. Paralysis of the lower limbs is also an
indication, and a sufferer is not always too far gone in this condition.
Obviously, this is really a case of " look before you leap " being
equally as true as "he who hesitates is lost " ; you are bound to be
wrong whatever you do. Personally, whenever a possibility of
coccidiosis is suspected I revert to using the drug before the patient
becomes so ill that one is going to lose it anyhow. But at the same
time, the indiscriminate use of the drug as a precautionary measure
is both dangerous and useless.
Treatment consists of simply administering sulphamezathine in the
drinking water. A 16 per cent solution can be obtained which is
mixed with the ordinary water in the proportion of 2 fluid ounces to
the gallon, or in smaller quantities this is equivalent to 1 drachm to
half a pint. The patient must not have access to any other source of
drinking water whilst being dosed, and the period lasts for five days
and no longer or the metabolism of the bird may be unbalanced.
The patient must obviously be housed indoors whilst being treated or
it would be able to drink rain water or even dew. If no improvement
is achieved from the first dose the process may be repeated after an
interval of ten days or so. Apparently, some individuals develop an
immunity naturally ; a situation might therefore arise where a healthy
bird to all outward appearances is supplied with a succession of com-
panions which die off, whilst the original inmate remains in the best of
health. Before leaving this subject I should mention that Sulpha-
mezathine is a registered name by Imperial Chemicals, and the full
title of the drug is sulphadimethylpyrimidine, which may be procurable
under other trade names for all I know.
The second point that I referred to as of interest concerns moveable
flights. The advantage claimed for this method is mainly that it gives

an opportunity for the soil to be rested and disinfected. It appears to
me that this is quite useless as a means of preventing a disease such
as the deadly scourge now being considered, since we know it is
carried extensively by wild birds. The coccidia can travel in the earth
by many means, such as earthworms, mice, attendants' boots, etc.,
moreover, many of my aviaries and many others known to me have
been in constant use on the same site for fifteen years. During that
period no epidemic of any kind has carried off a large batch of birds
at a sweep. There have, of course, been losses, many more than
I like to have, but never a wholesale epidemic among parrakeets.
I can recall one occasion about five years ago when a P.M. report
found coccidiosis, and the suggestion was put to me that I should
send samples of the droppings of all the birds for test at 2 s. 6 d. a time.
Well, I had over 400 birds just then, so I did not take advantage of
the offer, and there were no other losses either. As I had Manycolours
at the time and they were reputed to be one of the most susceptible
species to septic illnesses I have come to the conclusion that it is not
necessary to move the flights and no useful purpose is achieved by
doing so. Every spring, however, the turf is replaced with entirely
new meadow turf and the ground is forked over and dressed with
agricultural salt, lime. Since I heard about ammonia as an effective
antidote for coccidia, the ground has also been watered with a solution
before laying the new turf. Whilst this operation is in progress each
pair of birds is shut in the shelter for a few hours only and come out
to a new flight with fresh grass, perches, and the nest-boxes overhauled
and refilled. I am informed that the most efficient disinfectant
for washing down shelters, perches, etc., is ordinary ammonia.
With this treatment the stock appears to be as healthy and fertile as
ever.
Mention of fertility in conjunction with sulpha drugs brings up
another problem. It has been suggested that the use of these drugs
may affect fertility for a considerable period. Another good reason to
be very careful not to make indiscriminate use of them. Coccidia are
apparently most active in moist and warm surroundings, excessive
cold may increase mortality among them, but it is not necessarily
going to eradicate them completely. In fact, one would expect the
most favourable periods to be a wet summer or warm autumn, and
this is generally found to be the most vulnerable time when unexpected
losses do actually occur in the aviary, at least in my experience.
I have not noticed any depreciation in the fertility of any birds
treated with sulpha drugs, but having had this point always in mind
I have always avoided its use after December except in real emergency.
Fortunately the ensuing months are usually so cold that the coccidia
appear to be at least dormant, if present. I do recall, however, that
when an exceptionally mild February has been encountered this is

usually the season in which the most unexpected tragedies occur and
the results are comparatively disappointing from a breeding viewpoint.
Maybe there is some connection, or maybe it is just a coincidence.
My Manycolours have led me into deep waters and a long way off
the original course. Let us go back to them for another little item of
interest, somewhat elementary after the heavy going above. I am
often asked by beginners what mixture I use to feed my birds.
Strange as it may appear, I blend my seed as it is used every day,
the reason being that in my opinion the birds like a change, so an
effort is made to vary the diet to some extent ; it should also vary
with the season, too. Naturally, the individuality of each bird is
a very important factor here. Some will only select the particular
seed to which they are partial ; some, like children who elect to feed
on chocolate and ice cream, might choose to live on nothing but, say,
hemp. For that reason I have discontinued the practice of supplying
different seeds in different dishes, the majority of individuals did not
partake of a balanced diet but hogged their preferences. It surprised
a lot of bird-keepers during the war to find that their birds, accustomed
to the best super-Spanish canary, three or four varieties of sunflower,
hemp, etc., could not only keep alive but could keep in remarkably
good condition and even breed good youngsters on a mixture of third-
rate oat screenings, unmillable wheat, buckwheat, and occasionally
a " blitzed monkey nut " as a special treat, supplemented very rarely
with a teaspoonful of canary (with the usual percentage of mice dirt)
or dusty sunflower. I can recall how all these seeds were mixed up
and almost counted out, the poor birds selected the sunflower and
canary first and only turned to the substitutes when hunger forced
them. For this reason it became necessary only to feed on alternate
days so that the less palatable seeds were not used at all. With the
memory of those days, I did not mind making up my mixture and
varying it from week to week, even making slight adjustments for
individual pairs in order to keep them in top condition.
All the Psephotus Parrakeets need more canary than the larger
broadtails for instance. Some people are very doubtful about the
use of hemp. In my opinion it is a wonderful seed ; it certainly
increases fertility and fecundity but, of course, it is an oily and
consequently heating food. One hen Manycolour that I had--she
died about a year ago when she was quite twenty years old--made
a habit of plucking her chest and belly absolutely bare when the
breeding season came along. When she came to me she was in a
half-naked state and I was told she was pretty well useless. I used to
give her all the hemp she liked to take, much of it being sprouted ;
she was in an outdoor flight and when the moulting season came round
she regained her plumage fully and was duly mated the following
spring. For many years she reared families every season, every one

of the youngsters was perfect and none ever inherited the vice, and
to-day I still have some of her children and grandchildren. In spite
of the generous supply of hemp the cock never suffered any ill effects,
and although the hen always plucked herself at nesting time, she always
moulted out well in the late summer and remained well covered
during the winter. I would never hesitate to give hemp to practically
any birds rearing a family ; the only times it should be rationed
strictly is in the hot weather when no breeding is going on with that
particular pair. Sprouted wheat and hemp are beneficial at all times
in reasonable quantities. Oats should be rationed in hot weather,
but do no harm in the winter. Similarly, I believe buckwheat is
a very good food, although some Budgerigars' deaths were attributed
to impacted crops when it used to be their mainstay for lack of better.
The chief thing is to encourage any bird to consume as much green
food as possible, the only time this should be limited or withheld is
during frosty weather. Plucked or cut green food is a very different
proposition to green food actually growing in the ground, and mention
of this is made only because so many people turn round and ask
why wild birds do not get enteritis through eating frozen green food.
Another rather elementary question frequently asked by anyone
taking an interest in a fresh species is " How old are the birds when
they start breeding and how soon are they given a nest-box ? ".
With Manycolours my boxes are never shut up ; the birds generally
show an inclination to start very early, probably before February is
out. Closing the boxes seems to have no effect on the enthusiasm of
a cock broadtail, it only makes him bad tempered and he takes it
out of the poor hen as though it was all her fault. The drawback to
allowing early nesting is that Manycolours are inclined to stop
brooding the young at an early stage, frequently they are only ten
days old when the hen starts to leave them unbrooded at night ;
this, of course, varies considerably with individuals ; therefore if the
nights in April turn cold you stand a very good chance of losing the
clutch, especially if it is a small one of two or three ; nevertheless,
I generally take that chance. I have never lost a Manycolour egg-
bound so there is little fear of that. I always keep a few of those
small flat paraffin heaters, and if a cold spell was met with just when
it was most inconvenient, I would in such an unfortunate occurrence
put one underneath the nest-box, as it might help.
Some of my best young Manycolours were reared by a year-old
cock mated to a two-year-old hen. They only had one clutch of
three, but they were the brightest and largest ever reared by any of
my birds. The majority of the pairs I have had were double-brooded
but not all of them are. Possibly age has some bearing on this, young
birds go to nest a little later than fully adult ones, which is probably
a very good thing. Older birds have nearly always had two clutches

and have been prepared to try a third ; this is a case where it would
be advisable to cover the nest-hole up. No bird I have kept has been
more insistent on using their particular nest-box, and if it is ever
necessary to change their quarters, always try to keep the same box
for their use. The old hen who used to pluck herself always would
use a old rotten log which was patched up and filled with old nails
and wire to hold it together, yet she had the choice of three lovely
solid boxes. When one year the old log was removed she refused to
go to nest at all until it was returned, when she was inside within
a few seconds of my getting out of the flight. On the other hand,
one pair I have have never attempted a second brood even when the
first one was hatched in March; they are now three years old.
A further illustration of the idiosyncrasy of a parrakeet. Most broods
contain three or four youngsters with all the birds I have had, and
they seldom lose them except in the instance quoted where they have
gone to nest early and been unfortunate with weather conditions.
One thing leads to another when talking about birds. A disease
which sometimes affects the Psephotus Parrakeets is conjunctivitis in
some form. Probably several different forms are encountered, but all
are generally regarded by bird-keepers as " eye disease ". The most
susceptible subjects are Grass Parrakeets and Polyteline, although
many others are affected at times. Hitherto it has invariably eventually
proved fatal, in spite of some victims lingering for months. The
chances of importing Neophema by boat without catching this
highly-infectious complaint were regarded as about fifty-fifty. The
cause was attributed to overcrowding and filth--unclean perches in
particular. It is my theory that the main cause was mishandling of
the bird, and that dirt is only an auxiliary factor. Eye disease is
encountered in the natural state of liberty, and an instance is quoted
in the Avicultural Magazine, 1932, the interesting theory being
submitted that the conditions of drought which had been experienced
for some years were followed by severe sand storms which had most
probably irritated the eyes of the birds.
I kept this in mind when some years ago I had a cock Turquoisine
and two Bourkes for whom I had no mates, and could not obtain
any at that time. These birds were placed in small cages about
18 inches by 1 o inches by 1 o inches ; the floors were covered with sand,
a supply of grit and cuttle provided, two perches were fixed, and the
feeding and drinking vessels were arranged on hinged doors so that
they could be refilled without putting a hand inside the cage. The
object of this arrangement was to avoid startling the inmate in any
way. The cages were placed in front of a window facing south and no
one was allowed near the cages. For four months the birds were kept
in these quarters without being cleaned out at all. I had effected a cure
of eye disease and was really anxious to try it on a Grass Parrakeet ;

<bodyText confidence="0.997313688888889" page_id="56291582"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
but not one of these birds got any sign of it. This rather confirms
my theory that it is not caused by dirt alone, because these perches
became coated with the usual grey greasy deposit found under
such conditions and the droppings collected in pyramids. The
trouble starts when the birds are continually mishandled, and get
foreign bodies on the eye. In endeavouring to obtain some relief
by rubbing the eye on their perches an irritation is set up which,
in conjunction with the dirty perch, starts and rapidly spreads the
disease.
When I first saw sulphanilamide recommended as a cure for eye
trouble I could see no connection with internal treatment of an
external complaint such as this. But several medical men have
confirmed that these drugs will cure such an ailment, and my own
experience has proved it. In using this drug it was necessary to
handle a patient three or four times a day and this rather looked as
though any good one might do would be more than counteracted by
the harm from the shock the bird would suffer, however gentle one
tried to be. Some months later I passed this information to another
aviculturist who had a Grass Parrakeet suffering with conjunctivitis,
and he eventually reported a cure.
About this time I had a Salwatty King which had been taking part
in the film Blue Lagoon. This process entailed a good deal of handling
to move the bird from her usual quarters into the " props 55 parrot
cage. Every week-end for about ten weeks she came home and was
released into her usual 30 ft. aviary. The whole of the time her cages
were kept unusually clean owing to the frequency with which her
quarters were changed. Some weeks afterwards she developed eye
disease, and again I was convinced that handling and not dirt was
the cause. Rather in desperation, I decided that as the bird would
most probably die anyhow, I might as well try this improbable-
sounding cure. A medical friend suggested that better results might
be obtained by using another 1 similar drug, sulphamerazine, the
advantage of which was that its period of effective activity was
considerably longer than sulphanilamide. Eventually, I had a solution
made up of 60 grains in suspension in 1 fluid ounce, which was to be
administered only once in every twenty-four hours. The size of the
dose had to be arrived at by guesswork, and for a King about
ij grains was used ; this, of course, would have to be considerably
less for a Grass Parrakeet. Within ten days the swelling was gone
and there was no repetition of the trouble. I have since tried it on
other birds with equally happy results. It is essential to change the
perches daily because the danger of reinfection is great owing to the
bird developing the habit of trying to obtain some relief by rubbing
the inflamed eye. The administration of the dose, by the way, was
quite simple. A fountain pen filler, with a small elastic band to mark

the amount of the dose slipped round the tube, was held against the
lower beak and squeezed whilst the bird's head was held steady in
the left hand. A small hypodermic without the needle might have
been more efficient in skilled fingers.
The biggest nightmare for all breeders of Grass Parrakeets is
without doubt concussion. Some say that this is an overrated danger,
but I can remember the terrible reverses met with in the early days
of Splendids. Since that time I had begun to think that perhaps
I had been exceptionally unfortunate as there had been scarcely any
losses from that cause for many years. However, when I moved all
my birds, staggering losses were met with among Elegants and
Bourkes. Many of these birds were moved into temporary indoor
flights about 8 feet by 6 feet by 3 feet. The ceilings and walls were of
hardboard, which may have been responsible for some of the casualties,
but all trouble stopped when the birds were put into small stock
cages about 2 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 6 in. by 1 foot, one pair in each. Grass
Parrakeets, Bourkes in particular, are somewhat crepuscular in habit
and can frequently be heard flying about just after dark. As the light
was left on a time switch, although a small nightlight was left on all
the time, the birds may have been so startled by the sudden turning
off of the light that they committed suicide. I used to go in each
morning dreading to find another casualty ; two broke their necks
but most had badly bruised skulls, generally the blue bruise was at
the back of the head and base of the skull.
Having kept a number of these birds--some of those lost were six
or seven years old and regular breeders--without any undue losses
may I offer this warning to recall the matter to others. Once settled
in their surroundings there will probably be no further trouble
provided they are not changed round into another flight or subjected
to any interference from hawks, owls, or other night marauders. The
trouble is only met with when the birds are startled or unfamiliar
with their surroundings. When turning new birds out, cover the
ends of the flight with plenty of leafy branches, especially in front of
any solid surface. Victims are usually perfectly fit one minute and
dead or apparently paralysed an hour or even a few moments later ;
they never live more than twenty-four hours. Incidentally, Lineolated
Parrakeets also appear to be subject to this failing.
Perhaps it is time I closed these notes, but after all, the Editor asks
for them, and she can always slash them or save a bit for next time,
so I will continue with one subject on which our Secretary says I have
neglected to make a record--Lutino Ringnecks. I have reared a
number of these in recent years, one pair of birds, both yellow, used
to rear four young every year, all lutinos. They, of course, were
stolen from my old aviaries before I moved down here. They never
had anything but perfect youngsters and only one season did they

have one clear egg. They actually reared fifteen ; I wonder what
has happened to them now. That record, of course, illustrates the
Mendelian theory well, but some of my others are not so satisfying.
One split cock mated to a lutino hen only reared one lutino out of
three nests. Another pair, again split cock and lutino hen, have
reared four green, three green, two lutino and two green, and finally
two green birds in successive nests. Another pair, split cock and
green hen, have reared four green, three green and one lutino, two
green and two lutino, four green, four green, which means only three
lutinos out of twenty birds. Another pair that are not mine have
reared eight lutinos in the last three seasons although both parents
are green birds.
It is evident that two separate forms of lutinism exist in Ringnecks
even as there are two in Budgerigars, one being sex-linked and the
other non-linked. This is borne out by the results obtained by our
President at Foxwarren, as he records in the Avicultural Magazine,
1938 and 1940, that two lutino birds reared six youngsters which
were all green . Two lutinos of the same type can only produce 100 per
cent lutino young. Nevertheless, I believe that there are only sex-linked
birds left in this country to-day. It may be that the small percentage
of lutinos obtained is due to the embryos being weaker or parents not
caring for yellow monstrosities among their green family.
Now that the Duke of Bedford has succeeded in rearing the lovely
blue variety of this species we can look forward to the evolution of
a white Ringneck. Naturally, it will take a couple of generations to
achieve this, and with young Ringnecks unsexable until they assume
adult plumage this may take some years yet. Incidentally, many
people are not quite clear when Ringnecks do assume adult plumage ;
they are just about two and a half years old when the ring starts to
appear. It usually shows first almost on top of the head, considerably
higher up than its eventual normal position as the pigment starts to
show before the quill feathers have attained their full length.
Of course, the easiest way to produce the white would be to mate
a lutino cock to a blue hen, as the young could be sexed from birth.
All lutino birds would be hens split for the blue factor, and all the
green birds would be cocks split for both lutino and blue ; there
would not be any white in this generation but the sex linkage would
automatically determine the sex. By mating a blue cock to one of
these lutino/blue hens the white form could be anticipated, and it
would be a hen. White of both sexes could only be obtained in two
generations by mating brother and sister bred from the lutino cock
and blue hen.
Although the Avicultural Society is well past its jubilee, no article
has ever appeared in the whole of that period dealing exclusively with
breeding the Cockatiel. It is rather amazing, but although one may

find some indices containing about half a dozen or more references to
this bird, when you turn to the page indicated you have to read it
two or three times before you discover one little line where the word
Cockatiel is squeezed in a list of breedings or you find that it is the
page of P.M. reports. I should imagine that no bird is more of an
individualist, because I have never been able to take the slightest
liberty with any Cockatiel during the breeding season, one look has
always been the end of that clutch. Yet many breeders state that
they have even taken nestlings out and cleaned their quarters before
returning them, and the parents have not objected at all. Another
thing, they frequently will not breed in the first year in new
surroundings, and many young birds refuse to take any interest in
matrimonial affairs before they are two years old. I am well aware
that this is not the experience of many breeders, but in view of all
that Cockatiels must have done for aviculture by gaining new
enthusiasts I think they deserve a mention in dispatches. Like the
poor, they are always with us.

MY FIRST CANYON WREN

I have a good friend who lives on a very dry hillside away off the
beaten paths in Southern California. He is exceedingly bird-minded,
and he hails from Poland, where his love for birds was born. Though
nearing seventy, he waxes as boyishly enthusiastic over his feathered
charges as a seventeen-year-old might. He really is attached to his
birds and knows them and studies them from morning till night,
month in and month out, year after year.
Anyhow, Felix, that's part of his name, telephoned me with excite-
ment appropriate to such a rare find, that he had caught " him "
at last. He wouldn't identify " him ''--but I suspected from the
emotion in his voice that it was the Wren which I had wanted for
several months. A Canyon Wren (Catherpes mexicanus conspersus ) to
be specific. This fascinating little busybody had been " chinking "
( tc chink, chink", is his usual call) about the hillsides in Felix's neigh-
bourhood for several months, diligently examining every cranny and
corner of outlying houses, rockpiles, and similar hiding places for
delectable spiders and other Wren food. Always he would make his
presence known by his oft-repeated " chink, chink ".
So when this Canyon Wren searched for edibles about Felix's
bachelor dwelling, he, remembering my wanting the bird, simply
opened the back door and literally drove this elusive little chap

through it and into his bedroom, where he caught him. Having
caught my friend's enthusiasm over the rare catch, I literally jumped
into the old Ford and drove the twenty-five miles' distance in good
time. Sure, enough ! It was the Canyon Wren--beautiful little
fellow, with his chestnut-brown back and greyish-white breast, the
long, slightly curved beak, the cheery " chink " or " clink
Now he occupies a roomy, glass-fronted cage, furnished with rocks
and batches of dried leaves and the like to make the little chap feel
at home. Some perches are placed almost upright, for the Canyon
Wren is an inveterate climber--nothing seems too steep or too straight
for him to hold on to. His movements are rapid, very rapid, in that
he darts from place to place, always on the go, and always eager to
hide. Of course, I provided him with several good hiding places.
The result was that he would never show himself until I was some
distance away from his cage. Then he would appear as if from
nowhere, spot the mealworm I had dropped, seize it, and hasten to
his retreat behind a big rock, where undisturbed he could attend to
his meal.
Having had other shy birds, I thought that in due time this Wren
would confide in me, even to the point of taking mealworms and other
live titbits from my hand. But no, not this bird ! Daily he would
sing his charming little song and entertain me with his many antics--
but always at a distance. So after six months of playing hide and seek
with me, I thought I would remove the rocks behind and under which
he was wont to stay in my presence, leaving him hiding places still,
but not so many--and places where he could hide only partially.
The stratagem worked ! My Canyon Wren has become much less
shy, will not draw away in my presence, but remains in expectation of
getting mealworm, spider, or moth. Who knows, soon, perhaps, he
will even sing in my presence--his magnificent, descending scale song.
No, not soon--I know my Canyon Wren--months, many months,
will pass before he will approach me fearlessly. For he is ever wary.
This does not mean that he does not like human beings. He does
like them--but at a distance. Meanwhile this handsome little
charmer, considered the most beautiful of all North American Wrens,
entertains me and mine royally with his unique antics, as lovely
and spirited a bird as any I have had.

By John H. Walmsly (Port Elizabeth, South Africa)
I have been following with great interest the numerous articles
published recently by His Grace the Duke of Bedford, in connection
with his efforts to establish a strain of homing budgies. Whilst I have
no specialized knowledge of budgies and their habits, etc. (I leave
this little group in the capable hands of my wife, who has, at the
time of writing, about five or six pairs all busily raising chicks), I am
most interested in the experiments from a general point of view. Over
the course of several years of bird keeping I have had numerous
experiences with a fairly large variety of aviary birds, which lead me
to believe that there are many species which could be trained as homers.
I have noticed that the homing instinct is very strong in certain
members of the Serin Group. My experience with budgies when
released had, until recently, convinced me that the homing instinct
was non-existent in these birds. Those that I have from time to time
released invariably shot straight up into the air and then made off
as fast as possible, never to be seen again. It is to be hoped that
His Grace will continue to publish in detail the results of his
experiments in this field as they greatly contribute to our knowledge.
In that excellent work by Dr. Austin Roberts, Birds of South Africa ,
are details concerning the Cape Canary (Serinus canicollis canicollis ),
with an illustration. It is this species which is dealt with in this article,
but before relating my interesting experience of its strong homing
instincts I should perhaps mention the fact that I am not in any
way conducting any special experiments in this field and only wish to
record the facts for the benefit of those who may be interested in
experimenting further. Being intensely interested in bird life in all its
aspects, I am a member of the Port Elizabeth and District Pigeon
and Gage Bird Association, the Eastern Gape Wild Birds Protection
Society, and, more recently, the Avicultural Society. Among other
things I make a practice of buying up collections of aviary birds
when their owners tire of them or have to dispose of them for other
reasons. I recover some of my cash by reselling them to other collectors.
Many of them are sick, diseased, maimed, etc., when they come into
my possession. These I carefully nurse back to health, and at times
I frequently find myself in possession of too many of the more common
and cheaper local wild birds ; these I release as soon as they are
able to fend for themselves. The Cape Canary falls within this
category.
Last year I heard of one such collection being for sale and went
along to inspect it. A brief inspection revealed the fact that the
owner had little idea as to the basic requirements of cage birds.

About 200 birds were in an enclosure not large enough to accom-
modate more than two or three pairs. Most of the birds were infested
with grey lice and mice ran up and down the wire netting in front
of my eyes. At the time I had an exceptionally large stock of various
birds on hand and was rather stuck for room, and it was therefore
impossible for me to take over the entire collection. I eventually
acquired about forty of the more common Cape birds at a price
which nearly broke my heart. These I duly disinfected and isolated,
releasing them as they became ready and able to fend for themselves
once more. The remnants of this bunch consisted of three cock and
four hen Cape Canaries, which I placed in a fairly large breeding
cage in my garden. Eventually their turn for release came round,
and one bright sunny morning I opened the cage door, watched them
fly off into the thick surrounding bush, and then left home for work.
To my amazement I returned home the same evening to find all
seven contentedly sitting in a row in their cage. I then gave them
food and water and closed the cage door as a protection against cats,
hawks, etc. The following morning I repeated the procedure and
watched them fly away in a bunch. On my return from work in the
evening I again found them all in the cage. My coloured servant girl
said that they had been in and out of the cage all day long. I again
fed and watered them and closed the door of the cage for the night,
repeating my actions the following day by releasing them first thing
in the morning. This went on for about three months, during which
period several of my fancier friends came along to witness the fact that
I did indeed possess Homing Cape Canaries. Gradually the breeding
season came round again, and one evening in early August I found
that one of the hens was absent, a week later a pair failed to return,
which left me with two cocks and two hens. These were allowed to
come and go as they pleased. Towards the end of the breeding season
another pair failed to return, leaving me with one pair ; these were
allowed their freedom for several more weeks until eventually I had
to place them in my aviary. They are still there, and at the time of
writing show all the signs of wanting to breed.
The immediate questions arising out of all this are : (1) What
happened to those that failed to return ? (2) Did they stay away of
their own free will ? (3) Were they killed or captured ? (4) Why
did one pair under the same conditions remain true homers for several
months and not the others ? (5) Does this not prove that it is not
cruel to keep wild birds in cages ? (6) Does it prove that birds can
develop a true affection for their owners in the same way as dogs,
etc. ? (7) Would the young from the remaining pair inherit the
homing instincts of their parents ? (8) Is the call of the wild greater
than the call of captivity with its security and abundance of food ?
I do not know the answers to these questions, one guess is as good as

<bodyText confidence="0.997740323529412" page_id="56291589"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
By David M. Johnson (Port Orchard, Wash., U.S.A.)
Fifteen years ago I crossed a large Cornish Indian Game hen with
a Red Junglefowl cock {Galius gallus). These I have line bred all these
years perfecting a strain of compact roundness of rather small size with
slight pea comb and no wattles. Two of these hens have mated with
a Sonnerat's cock ; the fertility has not been high but the chicks are
hardy and virile, with astonishingly high capability of remaining alive
in spite of the cold, either frost or cloudy, cool days peculiar to the
north-west U.S.A.
The chicks started to hatch on Easter Sunday and continued to
hatch slowly, varying from the usual twenty-one days of the domestic
fowl, some hatching as much as three days later than this. The nest
was sufficiently humid and every egg that was fertile produced a hardy
chick. The fertility rate was two out of fifteen eggs and the other
clutch was six chicks out of fifteen eggs.
The chicks were hatched with pin feathers in the wings and in four
days had juvenile wings. They were all as much alike as peas in a pod
when hatched and to date (18th May) there is very little variation.
They develop rapidly and practice flying on the fifth day of life. They
are all striped chicks, and the feet and legs are slim and firm in contrast
to the puffy legs and feet of chicks with the stigma of domestication.
On the whole I should say that the wild Junglefowl is predominant
as the chicks now have striped underparts similar to the female Jungle-
fowl. The tail is carried low, or pointed downwards, and the wings
are large as in peafowl chicks. There is not yet any visible comb or any
distinction in sex, except in one chick which I suspect may be a cock ;
the rest have the appearance of hens.
The chicks demand meat vociferously, as do Junglefowl, and this,
with ordinary grain of mixed varieties, has been their only food. The
cock Junglefowl is kindly disposed to the chicks and runs about with
them.
Mr. Lint, of the Zoological Society of San Diego, tells me that this
cross has been achieved previously on various occasions, but unfortu-
nately breeders often neglect to publish records.

The passing, on nth June, 1952, of Dr. Albert Maurice Amsler
deprives the Society of one of its oldest and most able members.
Dr. Amsler had a very extensive medical experience, having been
House Surgeon, St. Bartholomew's Hospital ; Clinical Assistant,
Hospital for Children, Great Ormond Street ; and Physician and
Obstetric Physician, King Edward VII Hospital, Windsor.
He was in private practice at Eton for thirty years and during that
time came in contact with thousands of Etonians--being held in such
esteem that he was elected an Honorary Member of the Old Etonian
Society. He retired in 1936 and went to live at Delmonden Manor.
The breeding of birds was Dr. Amsler's special interest, as opposed
to mere keeping for ornament, and his successes were many. Perhaps
his greatest feat was the hatching of the Golden-fronted Fruitsucker on
three occasions, but none was reared beyond twelve days.
First successes were recorded on nine occasions, Hooded Siskin (1912),
Great Tit (1913), Orchard Finch (1915), Lesser Saffron Finch (1915),
Grey Francolin (1927), and Hermit Thrush (1927), Blue Rock Thrush
(1931), Amethyst Starling (1935)3 a nd Black-crested Finch (1939).
Other species bred include Swainson's Lorikeet, some twelve or
fourteen broods ; Occipital Blue Pie--this had only been bred once,
and that in the previous year by Lord Lilford ; Blue-winged Magpie,
Chinese variety ; Painted Finch ; Gouldian ; Siberian Bullfinch ;
Orange-headed Ground Thrush ; " American Robin " ; Parrot
Finch, and Tricoloured Parrot Finch (some thirty Parrot Finches in
a single year).
From the avicultural point Dr. Amsler will probably be best remem-
bered for his success in breeding Blue Robins, mainly by transferring
their eggs to the nests of wild birds and allowing them to do the rearing.
While still retaining a keen interest in aviculture--he was Chairman
at the British Aviculturists' Club dinner as recently as the 12th March

A MEMORY OF STEEP HOLM
By Dennis Lovell (Hayes, Middlesex, England)
The news that a large-scale project was afoot to ring the young gulls
on Steep Holm beckoned memories of my first visit to that lonely
Bristol Channel island.
It was early one morning in August when we embarked at Anchor
Head, Weston-super-Mare. About an hour later we set foot on the
pebbly beach at the eastern end of the island, and I well remember
the sense of exhilaration then felt. Our arrival was greeted by a
whirling cloud of Gulls, who vociferously expressed their disapproval
at such an invasion of their privacy. Wheeling above in an angry
crowd they cried, screamed, and laughed hysterically in well-nigh
deafening noise.
Steep Holm stands at the mouth of the Severn estuary, midway
between Somerset and Glamorgan, and two miles and a quarter from
its twin island of Flatholm. Shaped roughly like a rugby football, the
island is composed entirely of limestone and covers an area of approxi-
mately fifty-seven acres. The summit forms a plateau just over a mile
in circumference.
Once ashore, the six-hours stay quickly passed in the exploration of
the island and its wild life. Climbing the winding track above the
landing place, I was delighted to find many passerines and other small
song birds on the sheltered slopes, where sycamore, maple, elder, sloe,
lilac, privet, and bramble rioted in profusion. I caught an occasional
glimpse of the handsome Yellow-hammer, whose thin note refused to
be silenced by a sultry summer day. Several Swifts, one of the earliest
of our birds to fly south, alighted on a projecting rock above. Rock-
Pipits trilled sweetly, and one had a nest on the grassy verge of the path.
My notes also include reference to a Hedge Sparrow, Wheatear,

Linnet, Meadow Pipit, Song Thrush, Blackbird, and a Wren. (It
occurred to me that the latter might be a new sub-species, akin to the
St. Kilda Wren, for I carefully noted that its bill was bigger and its
tail more erect than those of the mainland kind.) Higher still, I
surprised a young Gull, dressed in speckled brown, who quickly hid
himself under the low-lying privet.
The boatmen, who had brought me across from the mainland, called
for a rest now we had gained the summit, and while they sat in the
warm sunshine, I took off my mackintosh and strolled across to inspect
the ruins of the ancient Priory of St. Michael, which was built on the
reputed site of an early Christian shrine, belonging to the monks at
Glastonbury.
This hallowed spot was now alive with Gulls--Herring, Lesser, and
Great Black-backed. Their nests were everywhere, not excepting the
exposed concrete roof of a nearby gun-emplacement. My presence
was evidently resented, and I was attacked by shrieks and wheeling
wings above, and all around me.
Many immature Gulls sought the shelter of bramble and boulder as
I scrambled over the southern slopes, where I also disturbed a suite of
Mallards, who promptly took to wing. I found three of their down-
lined nests before the flush, returning from the sea, alighted just above
me.
The footpads of Sheld-Ducks marked the entrance to one rabbit
burrow, indicative of their deep underground nest. About seven of
these handsome birds were resting on the waters below; their glossy
black, white, and orange plumage lending gaiety to the scene. Oyster-
catchers flew over the rocks, and I found their trilling whistle
quite pleasant in contrast to the screaming abuse from the parent
Gulls.
Consorting with the immature Gulls, I was intrigued to find several
fully-fledged young Gannets. Hiding under the mass of privet and
crawling quietly forward, I was able to study one of them at close
quarters. As large as a goose, its outstanding features were piercing
grey eyes, a long dagger bill, and webbed feet. Head, neck, and breast
were white flecked with brown, and it had black or very dark brown
plumage. These birds were, of course, in their first or second year, for
several moults must occur ere the young Gannet dons the more familiar
adult dress of nearly all white, with a tinge of buff on the head and neck
and deep brown wing-tips.
Magnificent in flight, the Gannet is clumsy in motion on land. I well
remember watching these youngsters alight on the plateau ; they
" touched down 55 in what seemed a heavy braking manner, with
wings, tail feathers, and webbed feet spread to capacity. I wondered
if they had travelled far. Possibly from the remote St. Kilda. Or had
they flown here from the Grassholm Gannetry ? It was easier to guess

at the reason for their presence on the island. At any rate, I concluded
that the young Gannets were but resting during migration south.
Pondering these things, I climbed back to the summit. Judging by
the number of corpses and skeletons that met my eye, it seems safe to
assert that the most perilous stage in a young gull's life is when it first
starts to run about. In this case I decided that the murderer was
probably some bird of prey. While I was seated at the edge of the
north-western cliffs, eating my luncheon sandwiches, I became aware
of the guttural croak of Ravens echoing among the crags. On a
near-by rock I spotted a pair of these huge crow-like birds, suspicious
of my intentions. At intervals of three minutes or so they would circle
over my head uttering their deep, angry cronk.
The Raven is amazingly clever on the wing. These two proceeded
to entertain me by an exhilarating aerial display over the sea--soaring,
gliding, diving, and flying on their backs like R.A.F. aces. I was
particularly impressed by their game of tumbling down from a con-
siderable height as if injured, then " flattening out " at the last moment
by throwing out wings.
The " show " was suddenly broken by the appearance out of the
blue of a sinister looking, yet beautifully streamlined bird--the
Peregrine Falcon, who, with incredible speed, swooped at his prey in
mid-air. The Ravens turned instantly, each in a different direction,
swerving and twisting so skilfully that they easily evaded the Falcon.
It was time to move. I walked some way along the rough path which
marks the northern edge of the plateau, until I came to some steps
leading to a narrow beach nearly 300 feet below. I sat on the topmost
step for a while, watching the Cormorants, dressed in black and bronze
with whitish patches, passing low over the water beneath me, when
I saw flying in from the sea at a great height a flock of small birds.
With swift unerring flight the invaders approached, their sharp-pointed
wings urging them through the still air. As the congregation lost height
I saw that they were mostly Golden Plovers, but included in their
number a few Lapwings.
Climbing on to the roof of a hut I lay motionless watching at close
view these lovely creatures. I heard the wild, flute-like cry of the
Golden Plover who, still in their striking wedding dress, spangled gold
and black with a white border, were sunning themselves or running
about picking up seeds and insects.
I slipped down from the hut roof and resumed my stroll, with the
inescapable cry of Gulls yet in my ears. The island abounds with
rabbits, a lean variety with rust head, nape, and back, which scurried off
in all directions as I drew near. A pair of Goldfinches sang from a single
thistle head, Linnets were feeding in caraway and clover, and a solitary
Turtle Dove came to glean fruit of the tall withered alexanders.
The tide was now at its lowest ebb. I could see to the east a spit of

sand and shingle, extending outwards from the landing beach for at
least 300 yards into the tideway, where a motley of waders were
preening themselves or foraging for shellfish, sand-worms, and other
sea creatures.
As we left that enchanted island a wind blew up and rain threatened.
All day I had watched the Gulls circle and wheel and dive and glide
with outspread motionless wings. But the prevailing memory is of
their artistry as they now nonchalantly rode the waves, or drifted like
flakes of foam on the wind close to the surface of the angry waters.

By R. S. Mackensen (Yardley, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.)
Last summer my father, William J. Mackensen, and I, procured a
number of wild duck eggs by air from Iceland. Represented in this
shipment were eggs from the Tufted Duck (Ay thy a fuligula), Barrow's
Goldeneye (Bucephala islandica), Old Squaw ( Clangula hyemalis ),
Northern Eider ( Somateria mollissima), Greater Scaup (Ay thy a marila ),
and Black Scoter (Melanitta nigra).*
These eggs were incubated by small cross-bred bantams, and we were
successful in hatching young of the Tufted Duck, Barrow's Goldeneye,
Greater Scaup, and Black Scoter. All young of the first three species
were reared to maturity with no difficulty. Three out of six Black
Scoters hatched were reared to maturity. The other three never
fed, and died within the first week. This we attributed to their highly
nervous and shy temperaments, which they had not outgrown up
to the time we sent two of them to the Highland Park Zoo at Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania. The third one was killed by a nursing rat.
These Scoters remained separate from other young ducks in our
holding pen, refusing to have anything to do with them.
It is interesting to note that for about the first week these Scoters,
having reached maturity and being placed for the first time in an
enclosure with running water of a sufficient amount in which to swim,
got thoroughly soaked to the skin each time they went in the water.
Mr. J. Delacour informs me that this is quite usual with all Scoters,
even wild trapped ones, who have been without swimming water for
several days. In fact, he says that they will drown if turned out on
a large lake at this time.
As is well known, Scoters are among the most aquatic of the sea
ducks and, in the wild, their diet is just about entirely marine animals
such as mussels, scallops, oysters, etc. Those which we raised were

the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that they have been

For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with poultry pellets,
let me explain that they are merely a finely-ground mash which has
been moistened, and then pressed together and baked into small

been correct in our contentions. Furthermore, we believe that this
discovery will make it fairly easy for anyone successfully to keep these
birds in captivity, and that it will also make it possible to keep species
that heretofore have not done well.

A BETTER WAY TO FEED HUMMING BIRDS
By Charles Cordier (New York, U.S.A.)
Most of the readers of this magazine are familiar with the longevity
records attained by Humming Birds in captivity ranging from two,
four, five, up to eight years.
In the light of these records it would seem that the diet for Humming
Birds in captivity has been solved satisfactorily. However, this is far
from being the case. The birds that live for years are the exceptions
and the others that live from forty days to four or six months are the
rule. My own experience over the years has convinced me that
practically any Humming Bird will live on honey or sugar-water alone
for about forty days. Even if fed from the very day of capture on the
standard formula of Mellin's food, condensed milk, meat extract, honey,
and a dash of vitamins, some will not live on this antiquated formula
for more than forty days, such as the Tooth-bills, which, as the structure
of the bill implies, are probably largely insectivorous. On the new
formula I am advocating this species does very well.
Thus the matter has stood for the last seventeen years and the poor
collector going in for Humming Birds simply never knew where he
stood after the crucial forty-day test, the period during which these
birds live anyway, no matter how wrongly they are being fed.
Fortunately I have been corresponding over the years with Dr.
Beraut of Rio de Janeiro, an ardent Humming Bird fan who keeps some
forty hummers in thirty species in one single small room with the
greatest success. He is keeping in splendid health all the species found
in the State of Rio de Janeiro, where I have collected twice, and which
I never managed to keep for long. Dr. Beraut simply never liked the
idea of these birds getting any cereal in their food, as in nature they
have no chance to do so. Little by little he evolved his own formula
and in view of his enthusiasm over it it did not take me long to make
up my mind to adopt it. The improvement is so phenomenal I do not
hesitate in passing the new formula on to our readers. In essence it is
simply the known formula from which the Mellin's Food has been left
out and essential vitamins added. At this writing I have a collection
of seventy specimens consisting mostly of mountain species which are,
by far, more delicate than lowland hummers or, rather, I should
write of their frailty in the past tense, as losses have been practically nil.
I am showing here quantities to feed forty Humming Birds. It must
be borne in mind that slight variations in the composition are in order.
The vitamin requirements indicated are desirable minima. Giving
a bit more does not matter. Not all honeys used are of equal sweetness.
More important than anything is the right quantity of liquid a Hum-
ming Bird must consume per day. The guiding rule here is : better
have the formula too weak than too strong. If the liquid is too weak

<bodyText confidence="0.998546860465116" page_id="56291599"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
the birds can make up for the deficiency by drinking more, whereas
if the formula is too strong they will suffer thirst and are sluggish.
About the right quantities the birds should drink see at end of article.
Here is the formula :
Salted meat extract, such as Armours in glass jars 3 grams
Sweetened condensed milk 40 grams
Honey 100 to 180 grams
Water to complete 1,000 cu. cm. or roughly 1 quart.
Vitamins A and D, for proportion see under vitamins.
After our return from Ecuador to the United States we have noticed
that the honey purchased here is so much weaker that we have to add
almost twice as much of it to get a formula of equal sweetness. Therefore
no hard and fast rule can be given regarding the proportion of honey
to be incorporated, and the amount should be experimented with until
the birds feed as much of the formula as indicated at the end of this
article. Do not alter the amount of condensed milk recommended.
We feed this mixture from 8 a.m. to about 6 p.m. At that time it is
replaced by honey-water to which vitamins B and C have been added.
If on hot days the food should get sour after staying in the bottles from
four to five hours, replace by fresh food. In zoological gardens the
complete formula is usually given at 8 a.m. and noon and replaced by
honey-water at 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m.
The honey-water is prepared by diluting 150 grams or more of
honey with enough water to make up 1,000 cu. cm. or one quart.
How to give the vitamins :--
The druggist should make up for you the following formula :
One ampoule Vitamin A of 600,000 units.
One ampoule Vitamin D of 100,000 units.
In 30 cu. cm. of almond oil.
The finished preparation will represent roughly 800 drops and each
drop coming out of a cut-off dropper (drops from a pointed dropper
are smaller) will contain 750 units of vitamin A and 125 units of
vitamin D. Beat four drops of this vitamin preparation into the
condensed milk you are using. Dilute the condensed milk first with
a little hot water to make the mixing easier. If done right the vitamins
will remain in suspension in the mixture. It will be noted that each
bird is getting that way, in theory, at least about 75 units of vitamin
A and 12 units of vitamin D daily.
Into the honey-water given in late afternoon add the contents of
one 1 o mg. ampoule of vitamin B (chlorhydrate of thiamine) and one
100 mg. ampoule of vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
During several months I have experienced with a multi-vitamin
preparation such as Vi-Penta, Abdecol, etc., one drop to 35 cu. cm. of

the formula and the honey-water. Birds did very well; however they
had difficulty in getting their wing-feathers moulted. By switching to
the four vitamins as described above in detail they moult their wing-

THE BARBARY DOVE
By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
The Barbary or Domestic Collared Dove, known to Americans by
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99555" page_id="56291600"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
the descriptive name of Blond Ring Dove, is a familiar cage-bird
almost throughout the world. Exactly when and by whom it was first
domesticated still seems to be uncertain. Many have supposed it to
be the " Turtle Dove " that was used in biblical times for sacrifices.
Although possible, this is a difficult point to try to prove, especially
in view of the fact that three wild species of Streptopelia , one of them
very similar to the tame bird, are--and presumably always were--
common in Palestine. On the other hand everything suggests that
the Barbary Dove has been domesticated for a very long period. It
was certainly well known in England in the eighteenth century,
when Albin published a coloured plate of a Barbary Dove under the
title of " The Turtle-Dove from the East Indies ", and informed his
readers in the description that " They are tame pretty Birds and kept
in Cages by the Curious where they will breed and bring up their
young ". Linnaeus, after saying mistakenly that it is found in India,
adds " our common Turtle-dove " obviously implying that it was
widely kept in Sweden in his day.
Some authorities consider the domestic Barbary to have been
derived from the Collared Turtle-dove or Indian Ring-dove ( Strepto-
pelia decaocto) which is found from South-Eastern Europe across Asia
to Japan, and has of recent years spread westward through Europe.
As was pointed out at length by Dr. Hartert in 1916 (,Novitates 2 joo-
logicae , xxiii, pp. 78-88) there are, however, many reasons for

<bodyText confidence="0.999364466666667" page_id="56291601"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
considering this incorrect---particularly the dissimilarity of their cooing,
and the fact that the Indian Ring-dove is larger than the domestic
bird, whereas it is an almost universal tendency for domestic forms to
increase in size--and every reason for supposing the real ancestor of
the tame bird to be the Rose-grey Turtle-dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea)
which is found in arid regions of northern Africa south of the Sahara,
and southern Arabia. Some modern systematists, however, consider
the Rosy-grey Dove and the Indian Ring-dove to be conspecific.
But in so far as concerns one of the chief points of interest in connection
with the domestic bird, it is immaterial from which of these two
species (or races) it originated. Unlike nearly all other domestic
birds the Barbary Dove shows little variation. Apart from a white
variety known to bird-dealers as the "Java Dove 55 it is everywhere
the same creamy fawn bird with black neck-ring and ruby eyes as our
familiar childhood pets. In this it differs from the Rosy-grey Dove
(and incidentally from all other wild species of ring-necked Turtle-
doves) which although almost identical in markings is darker above
with no buffish tinge and with a vinous pink tint on head and
breast.
That a domestic bird of long standing should show so little variation
is surprising, but for the natural colour to be unknown in the domestic
form is quite without parallel, and poses some interesting queries.
Are our domestic doves perhaps descended from some race of the
Rosy-grey Dove that has remained undiscovered by Europeans ?
This seems most unlikely. The only evidence in its favour is that of
an ornithologist who in recent years recorded that in a certain part
of Africa he observed doves of this species paler than any he had seen
before. He did not, however, secure any specimens, nor when
questioned could he recall any vital details as to their appearance.
It seems more probable that the creamy-buff form arose as a sport
from the wild type and is a true-breeding recessive. The latter is
suggested by the fact that when it is crossed with other species of
Doves the hybrids (at least those that the writer has been able to
examine), although intermediate in markings, show no sign of the
pale tint of the domestic parent. That any people should have
domesticated only abnormal examples of a species sounds at first
an absurd proposition. But is it ? Man has ever valued the unusual
and despised the commonplace irrespective of their intrinsic merits.
Even to-day white pheasants and peacocks are valued more highly
than normal coloured birds of far greater beauty. The wild Doves
of normal colouration, being no doubt abundant, there would have
been little incentive to bother to breed in captivity a bird of which
specimens could easily be trapped or netted when required. On the
other hand when a sport of the creamy-buff colour appeared, it would
no doubt have made an immediate appeal by its novelty and beauty.

Also the pale plumage may well have suggested a spiritual purity
that rendered such birds particularly efficacious as sacrifices, and thus
religious as well as temporal motives may have encouraged its
domestication. The discovery that if a pale bird was paired to the
relatively worthless normal type all the young resembled the latter
would no doubt have sufficed to induce the early breeders to con-
centrate solely on the former. In the absence of any detailed knowledge
of genetics it is most unlikely that any pointed experiments in the
way of interbreeding normally coloured young of mixed parentage
would have been undertaken, the occasional production of a pale bird
by normal parents being more likely to have suggested supernatural
rather than genetical implications. Thus the pale birds alone would
have finally become domesticated, and in that state disseminated
throughout the world.
The above is admittedly mere hypothesis, but one that seems best
to fit the facts of the case. At all events to whoever first domesticated
the Barbary Dove we are indebted for a bird which is a tame and
charming pet even when " kept in Cages by the Curious ", but is a
thousand times more attractive if allowed to fly at liberty, as it easily
may be, provided one takes care to shut it up safely at night out of
reach of owls and cats.

By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
Ocellated Turkeys are the most beautiful of all the game birds of
the New World. In the richness of their irridescent plumage they rival
the gaudiest Pheasants of Asia. Their large size, only slightly inferior
to that of the common Turkey, their graceful shape, and the curious
display of the cock all contribute to their striking appearance. A
native of the hot lowland forests of Honduras, Guatemala, and
southern Mexico, this fine species has always been scarce in European
collections, where a few have figured now and then in the past, but
never bred. In 1938 Mr. C. Cordier brought to Cleres and to Leckford
less than two dozen birds caught, or reared from the eggs, in the Peten
district of Guatemala. But at the end of the last war the only birds
left in England were merely a couple of hens at the London Zoo.
After the war Mr. Cordier accompanied Dr. D. S. Newill to the
Peten, and they brought over a nice consignment, which was dis-
tributed among American Zoos and a few game breeders. Two or
three young have been reared in recent years at the Washington Zoo
and at Mr. C. Hooke's game farm near Napa, California, now closed.
But the only real breeding success of these fine birds has occurred at
the San Diego Zoo, where a very favourable climate as well as special
and adequate care by the Curator of Birds, Mr. K. C. Lint, make con-
ditions particularly propitious.
Mrs. Belle J. Benchley, Executive Secretary, Zoological Society of
San Diego, reports as follows :--
" Ocellated Turkeys had been birds to conjure with until early in
1946, when several American zoos, including the Zoological Garden of
San Diego, joined with Dr. D. S. Newill, of Connelsville, Pennsylvania,
in a trip into Guatemala to collect the young birds with the aid of
local citizens.
" Dr. Newill, with the help of Mr. C. Cordier, brought back a
fairly large group of young birds. Each zoo which participated had
provided the sum of $500.00 for one pair of birds, and some of the
zoos had arranged for more than one pair.
"In November, 1946, Dr. Newill arrived from Guatemala with
a good collection and one pair was shipped to San Diego. The hen
was in a very weakened condition and the male had an injured leg
which had resulted in a stiff-joint at the knee. Otherwise he was in fine
condition and after his first moult made a show which was all anyone
could have expected.
" The hen had also greatly improved during the winter at the
hospital of the zoological garden. Early in June, 1947, she began

laying, and during that season she laid a total of twenty-eight infertile
eggs. The male showed no signs of sexual maturity, and it was not
until the following spring, 1948, when he really had attained full
mature plumage, that he began to display any signs of mating with
the hen. We could only hope for the best, but in case of failure I had
contacted the University of California through its Agricultural School
at Davis which was most anxious to obtain specimens or fertile eggs.
" And so, when the first eight eggs again proved to be infertile,
indicating complete inability to mate by the male, the head of the
Department, Dr. Lorenz, came down and artificially inseminated the
hen. As the result of this effort fourteen young Ocellated Turkeys were
hatched.
" Hatching was only the beginning of our trouble, for these young
Turkeys were subject to all of the troubles that beset the commercial
Turkey raisers of Southern California. Especially the early period of
summer in San Diego, with its overcast skies, and foggy mornings
contributed to their misery and deaths. However, we did raise five fine
husky youngsters from this artificial insemination and during the
second season we hatched and raised seventeen fine young Ocellated
Turkeys.
u We used artificial insemination on the imported pair for three
summers, but the third summer the finest and healthiest young we
produced were from our own trio of birds which we had raised in 1948
through the first artificial insemination by Dr. Lorenz. The original
hen was mated with the best cock of the 1948 hatch.
" The feeding habits of these birds are quite similar to our North
American Turkeys. They must have a high protein diet, including
mealworms, insects, and well balanced commercialturkey mash and
chick feed which play an important part. They consume weed seeds
too, and it appears that if we could turn them out in a large natural
area where they could pasture on the new young weed growth and
catch plenty of native insects we would not suffer so many sleepness
nights and headaches as they now inflict.
" However, Ocellated Turkeys are too rare to turn loose in an area
populated by a sight-seeing public, for many visitors would certainly
want to go home proudly waving a tail feather from one of the rarest
and most beautiful birds in captivity. With proper incubation and
three nice trios of mature birds we do feel that we will be able to keep
up an exhibit at least of these gorgeous birds. Fortunately also for us,
at least, the " pair " that the Zoological Garden of Philadelphia
received consisted of two hens, and consequently that zoo was happy
to exchange one of its hens for a San Diego hatched male. This gave
us a new strain which we have combined with one of our home-raised
cocks, and we hope Mr. Griswold will be successful in increasing his
flock.

" To date there has been only one other zoo that has succeeded in
producing fertile eggs, which was the National Zoo at Washington,
D.G. Now our young stock has gone to two of the European zoos,
and we hope that with a large number of institutions exhibiting and
working with these turkeys the Ocellated Turkey may be preserved,
if only in captivity. They are apparently becoming increasingly scarce
in the wilds, which probably indicates that they are neither prolific in
reproduction, very long lived, nor able to cope with advancing
civilization and its ultimate destruction of natural habitats."
There was a good stock of Ocellated Turkeys at San Diego when
I last visited the zoo on 29th June, 1952. Besides the three breeding
pens of a cock and three or four hens, five young birds reared in 1950
and five more hatched in 1951 make up a total of some two dozen
specimens. About twenty chicks were lively and well, and others
due to hatch. Mrs. Benchley is determined to establish and propagate
this most interesting species and to distribute her birds' offspring as
widely as possible.

Heavy rain in the morning cleared by three o'clock, and the many

The first of the South American Jacanas to be exhibited in the
Gardens was recently purchased. It is the Surinam Jacana (Jacana
spinosa jacana) --a curious bird with a carpal spur which is like a
rose thorn and quite as sharp, a large area of silvery lemon yellow on
the flight feathers and, of course, the very long toes.
Other purchases are a Golden-winged Sun-bird (. Drepanorhynchns
reichenowi ) and two pairs of Baikal Teal ( Anas formosa).
Those received in exchange include a pair of Dufresne's Waxbills
(Coccopygia melanotis)- --perhaps the most delightful of all the passerine
seed-eaters--a Red-crowned Parrot ( Amazona rhodocorytha) ; a pair
of White-eared Conures ( Pyrrhura leucotis) and two Grey-headed
Gallinules ( Porphyrio poliocephalus ).
The presentations consist of an Ocellated Turkey ( Agriocharis
ocellata ) ; a Great-billed Touraco ( Tauraco macrorhynchus ) ; a Sierra
Leone Green Fruit Pigeon ( Vinago calva sharpei) ; two African Pygmy
Geese ( Nettapus auritus ), and the late Mr. C. T. Maxwell's small
collection of psittacine birds which includes a Banksian Cockatoo
(Calyptorhynchus banksii).
The three Great Eagle-Owls hatched early in the year are almost
fully grown and the Snowy Owls are nesting.
The Quaker Parrakeets have built one of the large communal
nests of twigs, and this makes an interesting exhibit in one of the
Parrot House aviaries.
A Green-winged King Parrakeet has been bred, but the eggs
of the Grey-winged Trumpeters were again infertile.
The Stone Curlews proved themselves to be two females by each
laying eggs. One of these clutches was incubated for a few days by
Ringed Plovers who subsequently nested on their own account, but
did so near enough to the front of the aviary to tempt a thief to cut
the wire-netting and remove the three eggs.
Common Rheas laid and plaster of Paris " eggs " were placed in

the paddock in the hope of inducing the male to incubate, but someone
climbed two fences and braved the wrath of the male in order to
secure this disappointing prize.
The Night Herons seem to be nesting as usual in the willow trees
of their aviary and a Gannet is sitting.
The King Penguins have laid, as have Sclater's Curassow and
West African Crowned Crane.
A Gaboon Forest Robin, brought from British Cameroon in 1948
by Mr. Webb, laid two eggs. It seems that the eggs of this bird have
not been described and so, of course, these have been sent to the
Museum. A Blue-shouldered Robin Chat brought at the same time
also laid two--the normal clutch--and this bird, together with a
mate, has been sent to Foxwarren in the hope of a breeding success.

UMBRELLA BIRD IN NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK, WASHINGTON
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9951694" page_id="56291608"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
To-day, 4th July, 1952, an interesting bird was added to the collection of the
National Zoological Park. It is the Umbrella Bird, Cephalopterus ornatus. This bird
was named in 1850, but in 1836 Swainson likened its crest to an umbrella. Shaw
referred to the species as the Umbrella'd Chatterer. The bird is so called from the
remarkable crest of feathers it wears, the shafts of which, when displayed radiate on
all sides, reaching beyond the tip of the beak, and forming a perfect dome some
five inches in length by four inches wide.
Another curious appendage is a cylindrical fleshly process, a plumed wattle, an
inch and one-half long, pendent from the front of the neck, and clothed in imbricated
feathers. The bird is about the size of a crow, its plumage entirely black, glossed
with blue in places and especially on the crest and wattle. This species inhabits
Colombia, Guiana, and a great part of Brazil and Ecuador. The Umbrella Bird
is a member of the family Cotingidae, the-group that embraces the Bell Bird and
the Cock-of-the-Rock. Its diet in captivity is rather simple. The bird seems to
thrive upon hard boiled egg grated, Mocking Bird food, and all varieties of fruits
such as banana, orange, cherries, and a bit of raw hamburger. It is also fond of
mealworms and the larvae of other insects.
Malcolm Davis.

in the New York Zoo was published in the Avic. Mag. Sept./Oct. No. 1950.-- Ed.]

TURQUOISINE PARRAKEETS

I am writing about a letter that appeared in the Magazine of Jan.-Feb., 1952. It
was from Mr. Boosey re some Turquoisines bred by a member in California.
I think I should point out that " Erythism " is fairly common among Turquoisines
in the wild state ; I have seen a lot of it. The Turquoisine's main range is now in the
Narrabri district, about 400 miles north-west of here. The red on these birds is quite

characteristic. It differs from that in a Splendid in three main ways :--
(1) It is commoner in hens than in cocks.
(2) It is situated mainly, or completely, in the posterior part of the abdomen
from between the legs to the vent.
(3) It is a very much darker red, being to the red on a Splendid as that of a
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9642147" page_id="56291609"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
Maroon Tanager is to that of a Scarlet Tanager.
I once had a cock bird every feather of whose breast and abdomen was outlined in
red. The late Mrs. Ike Winson, of Appin, N.S. W., had a cock that was almost all red,
from beak to vent, and the patch on the wing covered almost the whole wing. It was
a most beautiful bird. I have seen hens with a red wing patch but they are rare.
Mrs. Winson's bird was trapped at Teny-Hi-Hi in the Narrabri district.
The Australian Museum in Sydney has a lot of these skins, donated by the late
Mr. Wachsman and by myself. It may be suggested that these birds are hybrids.
This is not so. They are true Turquoisines. I have no doubt that the Californian birds
are showing some of this characteristic.

Every one of us must admire the untiring industry with which the
late Mr. N. W. Cayley described and illustrated the birds of his native
land, and in his What Bird is that ? he has left behind him a truly
admirable reference book on the birds of Australia, which will always
be of inestimable value to both ornithologists and aviculturists.
As is often the case with very prolific painters, however, his work
as a bird artist tended to be of uneven quality, and I personally con-
sider the accompanying colour plate one of his less successful efforts,
as it cannot be called an accurate portrayal of either of the birds it
depicts.
While I should hate to appear in the role of a carping critic, I do
think the mistakes in the plate should be pointed out, as there has
always appeared to exist a certain amount of confusion in people's
minds when it comes to identifying the various species of Grass
Parrakeets.
To deal with the Elegant first : as to shape, it has not got nearly
such a long, flat, snake-like head, and although this was possibly done
by the artist to show the colours, no Grass Parrakeet normally sits with
its tail spread as depicted in the plate. Then, as to colour, the Elegant
is not, as the plate suggests, of the same grass-green as a Turquoisine,
but of a very beautiful golden-olive colour, which is peculiar to itself,
and thereby differentiates it at a glance from all other Grass Parrakeets.
The blue in the wing is not a more or less uniform dark blue (as in the
Bluewing) but dark blue at the lower edge, with a very distinct line of
pale turquoise above. The frontal band is not of a single shade of blue,
but is dark blue bordered with pale turquoise at the upper edge.
Finally, the underparts are golden-olive ; much yellower on the
throat and cheeks ; and merging into pure golden-yellow on the

abdomen, in the centre of which, particularly in rather old males, there
is often a patch of bright orange.
The Rock Grass Parrakeet has a more sharply-defined dark blue
frontal band than appears in the plate, and there is certainly no
reddish-mauve at the lower edge of the wing. Its extremely dull body-
colour is of a shade difficult to describe, but as depicted in the plate
it is much too green. I would say myself that it is of much the same
drab rather nondescript greyish-olive colour as a hen Redrump
Parrakeet.
The Elegant, while it does not compare with the Splendid or the
Turquoisine for brilliance of colouring, is nevertheless a very beautiful
little bird in its quiet way, and the female resembles the male except
that all her colours are duller and her green is more olive with much
less yellow in it.
They inhabit South-Western Queensland, New South Wales,
Victoria, and South-Western Australia, and spend much of their
time on the ground feeding on the seeds of various grasses. They are
said to be very shy in a wild state, sometimes, when disturbed, flying
right away at a great height, and at others, flying low with a curious
zig-zag flight before again alighting on the ground.
Elegants are among the most satisfactory of the Grass Parrakeets in
confinement. I have kept and bred them regularly for the last sixteen
years or so, and they were the only species of Grass Parrakeet we
managed to keep going at Keston all through the war. They are also
the only member of the Grass Parrakeet family to have become
sufficiently well-established in a few people's aviaries in this country
for one to see young ones offered for sale at fairly regular intervals.
Bourkes, of course, are quite well-established, but they are not true
Grass Parrakeets, being something quite on their own.
Regular and willing breeders as Elegants are, they seem--unlike
other members of the family--always to go in for very small broods,
consisting of two or at most three young ones. I originally thought
that this might be a peculiarity of the various pairs we have had at
Keston, but a gentleman who breeds them and wrote to me recently
told me that his experience in this respect has been exactly the same
as mine.
Elegants have a weak, inoffensive, sibilant cry, which they frequently
utter in early spring, at which time they become unusually active. At
other times, however, they are very quiet little birds--perhaps rather
too much so--as they are inclined to spend most of their time sitting
inside the shelter of their aviary.
We breed ours in a nest-box about 8 inches square by 18 inches deep,
hung up under overhead cover in the flight, and with either a half
coconut husk fixed in the bottom or, failing that, a filling of a few
inches of decayed wood.

They will flourish for years on a diet of canary seed with a few
groats, and a daily pinch of sunflower and hemp, and the amount of
both the latter can be considerably increased during the breeding
season. As one would expect, they are extremely fond of the seeding
heads of grasses, and like most parrakeets they love spinach beet and
can also be given chickweed, etc. Although not a fruit-eating species
in a wild state, some pairs in confinement nevertheless become very
fond of ripe sweet apple, and this should be given by pushing a thin
slice through the wire netting, close to a perch.
Elegants are perfectly hardy and can be kept out of doors all the
year round provided their aviary has a dry, draught-proof shelter,
into which they can be shut each night during the winter months.
Of all the Grass Parrakeets, I must confess I have always con-
sidered the Rock Grass quite the dullest and least interesting member
of the family, both as to temperament and colour. As to the latter,
which I have described at the beginning of this article, its very dullness
is probably a useful protection to a coastal bird which lives and breeds
on the rocky cliffs and shores of South and Western Australia, choosing,
in preference, we are told, " those facing the water and most difficult
of access."
Quite unlike any other Grass Parrakeet, the Rock Grass's choice
of a nesting site is much the same as that of a Jackdaw--namely the
holes and crannies to be found on a cliff-face, preferably under an
overhanging ledge of rock. Despite this, however, they are quite
prepared to use an ordinary wooden nest-box in an aviary, and before
the war a pair nested at Keston, but all the eggs were infertile. This,
however, did not greatly surprise me, as the Rock Grass Parrakeet
seems to share with the Orange-bellied (with which we had the same
experience) a fatal tendency to become grossly overfat in confinement.
Of course it is unfair to judge by the only pair one has ever had of any
particularly rare species, particularly as one does not know their
previous history, and it is quite possible that the extreme corpulence
of our Rock Grass and Orange-bellied was caused either by old age
or long cageing--or by a combination of both.
The pair of Rock Grass, in particular, used to remind me of two
very old people who regard the slightest hill with horror, yet, in the
Spring, they succumbed to a certain seasonal skittishness, and, after
a few turns round the aviary, used to sit at opposite ends of it, and
suffering from violent palpitations, look reproachfully at each other,
as much as to say, " Is this sort of thing wise at our age--and with our
infirmities ? " I personally thought it far from wise, and was terrified
that the cock--who was the fatter of the two--would drop dead of
apoplexy at any moment, which, if I remember rightly, was what
did eventually happen.
Rock Grass Parrakeets are much about the same size as Elegants,

and should be fed, housed, and treated in exactly the same way, except
perhaps that, as to feeding, if the over-fatness of our pair was typical
of these birds in confinement, they should be severely rationed to plain
canary seed and green food, and should on no account be given such
fattening things as hemp, sunflower, or groats, unless one was lucky
enough to have a pair which bred successfully, when a small quantity
of all three might be added to their seed diet.

FOREIGN BIRDS AT LIBERTY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9955094375" page_id="56291619"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
By the Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Bedfordshire, England)
The keeping of foreign birds at liberty in this country has some of
the charm, and also some of the dangers and difficulties, of falconry.
In both cases you are using your ingenuity so to manage a wild bird,
which is entirely free, that it will keep near either your person or
your home. The beauty of many birds can undoubtedly only be seen
at its very best when they are flying against a natural background of
trees and sky, but the danger, of course is, that they may stray or be
destroyed by birds or beasts of prey--and that is just too bad !
In general throughout my article when I mention certain species of
birds as giving good results at liberty, you may assume that other
members of the same group, fairly often imported, which I do not
refer to, were tried, either by my father or by myself, without success.
Beginning with very large birds, i.e. the Cranes, it is necessary
if success is to be achieved with those that are full-winged, for them
to be able to range unmolested over a large area of ground as their
breeding territories are of considerable size. To encourage full-winged
Cranes to stay and nest it is necessary, also, to have ponds with rushes
and similar vegetation round the edges. These ponds, however, need
not be large ; it will even suffice if they are only a few yards in diameter
provided that they are quiet and of the character just described.
The Indian Sarus Crane has given good results when full-winged
and before the war Mr. Ezra was particularly successful with them.
The drawback with Sarus is that the males, when in breeding condition,
are apt to be spiteful with other large birds, and if these latter are
pinioned they are apt to be overtaken and killed by the full-winged
aggressor.
The Japanese White-necked Crane also does well full-winged. It is
not completely trustworthy with ducklings, but does not regard them
as a regular article of diet as does the White Asiatic Crane. The
Stanley Crane might give good results at liberty, but we never fully
reared any young birds.

The beautiful Manchurian Crane unfortunately is a very bad
stayer.
Coming now to waterfowl, none of the wild swans are very good
stayers full-winged, although a few Black Swans may occasionally
remain where they have been bred, if territories are adequate.
Of the wild geese the Canadian and the Egyptian are of course
now naturalized in certain parts of the country. Although so
murderously spiteful towards ducks, etc. when closely confined, the
Egyptian Goose when full-winged and living on large lakes, does not
interfere with small ducks, but confines its quarrels to members of its
own species and Sheld-Ducks, and to a lesser degree, to other geese.
Snow Geese, both Greater and Blue, can sometimes be induced to
stay full-winged and a flying flock is most ornamental. The same is
true of Barnacle Geese. Magellan Geese and their near relatives
the Ashy-headed and Ruddy-headed stay well at liberty where there
is enough room for breeding territories. If at all overcrowded,
however, they have a habit of showing their devotion to their own
children by killing those of their neighbours ! Most wild geese are
extremely moral birds, but a sad and disgraceful tragedy once
occurred at Woburn. A Magellan gander, whose mate was sitting,
was seduced into a love affair by an unmated female. In due course
his wife appeared with a family, and a little while later the other
lady also appeared with a family. Whereupon, I regret to say, the
gander assisted his wife in killing his illegitimate offspring !
The beautiful little Red-breasted Goose is, unfortunately, quite
hopeless full-winged, no matter how you try and start them.
Of the Sheld-Ducks, the Ruddy may stay tolerably well on a large
estate. Like the Egyptian Goose, it does not persecute smaller ducks
when living under more or less natural conditions, confining its
quarrels to other Sheld-Ducks and to Egyptian Geese.
Of the smaller ducks the Mandarin is the most successful, and is
now well established in, to all intents and purposes, a wild state, both
at Woburn and in the neighbourhood of Virginia Water. Success
on a much more limited scale has sometimes been achieved with the
Carolina. If, after starting with pinioned birds, some full-winged
ones are staying well, it is necessary, before the breeding season, to
dispose of the pinioned ducks or the full-winged drakes will persecute
and kill them. The Chiloe Widgeon, though such a free breeder in
captivity, is but a poor stayer at liberty, and the same is true of the
Fulvous Tree Duck which may stay for a time, but usually strays in
the end.
Of the gallinaceous birds, the Red Jungle Fowl does quite well at
liberty, and Sonnerat's maintained itself at Woburn for a few years,
although it is not considered to be entirely hardy.
All the pheasants of the Kaleege group, including the well-known

Silver, do well at liberty with a little winter feeding, but they are
somewhat pugnacious and also decidedly addicted to egg-eating.
Both the Amherst and Golden Pheasants do very well at liberty, and
establish themselves in an entirely wild state. The two species cannot,
however, be kept together on account of their hybridizing so freely.
Although they cannot be trusted with crocus bulbs in a flower garden,
they are much less destructive than common pheasants to farm crops
and garden vegetables. It is not true that they fight with, and drive
away, common pheasants. It is indeed unreasonable to suppose that
they would be able to do so as the cocks' spurs are blunt and rudi-
mentary, and they are not nearly such heavy birds.
The splendid Reeves' Pheasant also maintains itself fairly well at
liberty, although in much smaller numbers than the Amherst and
Golden. It, too, does not interfere seriously with common pheasants.
The gamekeepers at Woburn have never complained of their behaving
in this way, and on only one occasion have I ever seen Reeves' cocks
causing some disturbance by displaying to a common pheasant's
harem. Hybrids with the common pheasants very seldom occur.
Elliot's Pheasants maintained themselves at Woburn in small
numbers for several years, but they were ultimately wiped out by a
very severe winter at a time when it was not possible to feed them.
Monsieur Delacour has been successful with Crossoptilon Pheasants
at liberty, but the Brown species which we tried at Woburn did not
do well, and failed to establish themselves. They were also very
bad egg-eaters.
The Common Grey Peacock Pheasant did quite well at liberty as
long as it was possible to provide plenty of winter feeding. Bamboo
Partridges were also fairly successful under the same condition.
The Indian Chukor is a very charming bird kept at liberty in the
garden in a half-tame condition. It usually roosts on the roof of the
house. Mr. Ezra has been very successful with them at Foxwarren
Park. At Woburn our success was more limited owing to the birds'
extreme pugnacity. When the breeding season arrived two or three
pairs divided the whole garden between them, driving away all the
others which were never seen again. The cock Chukor, unlike the Grey
Partridge, is a very bad father, taking no care of his family, and even
at times killing them if he should happen to meet them.
The curious Australian Brush Turkey is not, of course, a gallinaceous
bird. It does well at liberty if fed in the winter, and is interesting on
account of its extraordinary nesting habits, but it is an extremely
bad egg-eater, and it will in addition kill young pheasants.
Of the members of the pigeon family Malay Doves and Australian
Crested Doves are by far the most successful provided, of course,
that they are fed throughout the year. If Brown Owls are not too
numerous some success may also be achieved with the beautiful little

Australian Peaceful Dove, but the Zebra Dove, which rather closely

resembles it, cannot stand cold.
The South American Spotted Pigeon also does well at liberty, but
the African Triangular-spotted Pigeon is sensitive to cold. At
Woburn we had some success with a South African Wood Dove of the
correct name of which I am not very certain. The neck and breast
are vinous in colour ; the wings bronzy green, and the forehead,
especially of the male, is greyish-white. The young in first plumage
are coloured rather like grouse.
Of soft-billed birds, the Red-eared Bulbul proved surprisingly
hardy and an excellent stayer. Bulbuls should be fed on banana or
other soft fruit, either on a trap feeding stand where Blackbirds and
Starlings, which steal the fruit, can be caught and removed; or by
covering the fruit with a kind of wire dish-cover arrangement through
which the slender Bulbuls can pass, but the larger birds cannot.
Bulbuls have one unfortunate failing : they are very pugnacious, and
each pair insists on having a large territory, driving away their young
as soon as they are independent. As a result the stock never increases.
Pekin Robins established themselves in the shrubbery containing
much privet and bred for a number of years in an entirely wild state.
In the end, however, they disappeared, and I do not think they could
survive an exceptionally hard English winter.
With regard to seed-eating birds of the Finch family, the Dominican
and Red-crested Cardinals can be bred at liberty. A very large
percentage of those turned out, however, stray, and the pairs which
remain have the same unfortunate habit as the Bulbuls. They insist
on large territories and drive away all their young. I once induced
a Virginian Cardinal to nest at liberty, but the young were destroyed
by Jackdaws.
Saffron Finches I have also bred at liberty, providing artificial
food throughout the year. As with the Cardinals, however, a very
large percentage of those turned out ultimately stray.
Of the Australian Grass Finches, I had great success at Woburn
one summer with Zebra Finches and Rufous-tailed Finches, large
numbers of young being reared. Owing, no doubt to lack of skill,
I have not, however, been very successful in wintering either Grass
Finches, Waxbills, or even Weavers. Losses have been heavy after the
birds have been caught up in autumn and taken into winter quarters,
and with birds which go on breeding late into the autumn it is always
a little difficult to avoid catching parents with young still in the nest.
Success on a much more limited scale was also achieved with Long-
tailed Grassfinches, Parson Finches, and Diamond Sparrows.
Gouldians did badly at liberty, proved poor stayers, and showed no
inclination to breed.
The Orange Weaver, and its very near allies, is a most striking bird

at liberty and a fairly good stayer, provided, of course, that artificial
food is always available. The cocks in colour darting about like little
balls of fire, were a most lovely sight, and a fair number of young were
reared.
Of Waxbills, I reared at liberty in my garden at Havant the Common,
Orange-cheeked, Orange-breasted, Red Avadavat and Cordon Bleu.
I also tried the curious and delicate Black-cheeked Waxbill at liberty
and managed to get some of them in such excellent condition that they
did not mind the early autumn frosts. When I caught them up, by
reason of their largely insectivorous habits I put them in a warm
greenhouse, but a few days after they were brought in they began to
die in the most extraordinary fashion. One moment one would see
them apparently in perfect health, tight-feathered and lively, and then,
even as one watched them, they would suddenly fall dead from the
perch just as if they had been shot.
A pair of Violet-eared Waxbills I managed to keep out of doors at
liberty even through the winter, but they did not breed.
Of Parrot-like birds at liberty I have had considerable experience.
I have never myself kept the parti-coloured Macaws, although they
are said to be good stayers, and I believe the Red and Yellows and
Blue and Yellows have bred in a state of freedom. The all-blue
Macaw, which I have tried, unfortunately proved bad stayers.
We were not successful in persuading the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo
to stay at Woburn, although it has been bred on one or two occasions
elsewhere.
The beautiful Leadbeater's Cockatoo is one of the most satisfactory
members of the family at liberty, being very ornamental and not
destructive. The cock should be allowed to fly free for some weeks
before his mate, confined in an aviary, is allowed to join him. As in
all cases where perching birds are kept at liberty, a constant supply
of food must be provided.
The quaint Gang-gang Cockatoo also does well at liberty if started
in a similar fashion, but it is one of the few Cockatoos which are fond
of fruit and is liable to cause trouble by damaging one's neighbour's
apples.
The Roseate Cockatoo is a charming bird at liberty, and does no
damage, but it is apt to wander rather far from home, and it is well to
invite the forbearance of neighbours on to whose ground they may
stray. Adult imported birds are unfortunately not good stayers, but
young bred in one's aviary stay extremely well. Until they are
through their first moult, however, they are somewhat delicate, and
apt to pick up the germs of infectious disease. The bird to be released,
after being accustomed to its feeding place, should be caged without
food on the afternoon previous to its release. In the morning it
should be taken in its cage to the roof of the aviary of the parent birds,

<bodyText confidence="0.999274" page_id="56291624"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
and allowed to find its way quietly out. A young bird released in this
way will sometimes try and roost on the side of the aviary and adequate
perching accommodation and shelter from wind and wet should
therefore be provided, at least for a time. It is sometimes possible to
accustom Cockatoos before their release, by gradual stages, to go in
and feed inside a kind of box where the food is not visible from outside.
The object of this device is to prevent the food being stolen by wild
British birds. Two things must be borne in mind ; first that tits will
sometimes find the food even though it is not visible from outside the
box and, when this happens must be captured and taken away to a great
distance before they have revealed the secret to many other members
of their species; second, that a Cockatoo, trained to feed in a box inside
the aviary, will often fail to recognize a similar box on the top of the
aviary as a source of food, unless for a few days the food is placed where
it is visible and the bird, as it were, rapidly re-trained.
The Indian Ringnecked Parrakeet often stays fairly well at liberty,
but it is extremely destructive to apples and must therefore be confined
during the period of the year whdn the fruit is ripe or ripening.
Unlike some species of Parrakeets, however, it is not a bud-eater, and
can safely be allowed its liberty in the spring. A cock of this species
inhabited Kensington Gardens for many years, where people used
to feed him on peanuts. I got him a hen, but unfortunately he
disappeared not very long afterwards.
The Australian Broadtailed Parrakeets, although certain difficulties
attend their management, are among the most beautiful birds which
one can have at liberty and, mainly before the first World War, I was
successful, at Woburn, in breeding Barnards, Pennants, Adelaides,
Red and Mealy Rosellas, and Redrumps. It is, however, only the
large members of the genus which are safe from that curse of liberty
aviculture, the Brown Owl. Rosellas are rather on the border-line
of the species which can bite hard enough to defend themselves from
the owl's attacks and Redrumps definitely cannot do so, which is a
great pity, as they are one of the most charming species to keep at
liberty, and one of the best stayers, besides not being destructive in
the garden. If an attempt is made to keep Redrumps at liberty and
one of a pair should fall a victim to a bird of prey, a new mate must
be provided at once or the survivor will stray in search of
one.
With Broadtails, unlike Polyteline Parrakeets, it is the cock who
decides the movements of the pair, and a cock who is a good stayer
will induce his wife, or wives, if a casualty among his partners should
necessitate a replacement, to remain in the vicinity of the owner's home.
Some pairs of Broadtails have a maddening habit of staying until the
very beginning of the breeding season, and then clearing off for good,
just when one feels certain that they are safely established, but a cock

who has once bred in, or near, the garden, will not leave his home as
long as food is provided and a mate is with him.
In places where natural hollow tree trunks are scarce, plenty of
nest-boxes must be provided, and care must be taken to see that they
are not appropriated by Starlings, which can be a great nuisance in
the spring, some pairs being very pugnacious and able to drive away
even the more powerful Broadtails. Troublesome Starlings should
be shot, preferably with a weapon which does not make much noise,
and the rubbish they have put in the boxes cleared out. Fortunately
it is only for a short period that they are troublesome, as they are
single-brooded and, before a very late date in the spring, each breeding
pair has found nesting accommodation somewhere. The principal
misdeeds of Broadtails are too great a fondness for fruit tree buds when
these are swelling in the spring, and also a taste for ripe apples in the
autumn, although they are nothing like as destructive in the orchard
as are members of the Ringneck family. The young of the larger
Broadtails bred at liberty at first come with their parents to the feeding
place, but later many of them become very independent and wander
to considerable distances, living on natural foods. Adelaide Parrakeets
during the first World War maintained themselves as completely
wild birds for a number of years, without any artificial feeding
at all.
Occasionally pairs of Broadtails at liberty are troublesome in
fighting captive pairs of birds of the same genus in their owner's aviaries,
the danger being greatest when the confined birds belong to a smaller
species capable of putting their beaks far through the wire-netting.
There is then a great danger of their getting their upper mandibles
bitten completely off, as once happened to a Hooded Parrakeet of
mine when fighting with a liberty Barnard.
When starting a pair of Broadtails at liberty, it is advisable at
first to release the cock and then allow his mate to join with him when
he knows his way about the garden.
Cock King Parrakeets, whose mates are confined in aviaries make
charming liberty birds, being very decorative, quite safe from owls,
not really destructive, and never going more than about a hundred
yards from the place where their mates are confined. They are also
not pugnacious. In the breeding season it is an easy matter to entice
them back with food and an inward-pointing funnel of wire-netting,
into their mates' aviaries.
Cock Crimson-winged Parrakeets, whose hens are confined, also
make delightful liberty birds, not only by reason of their gorgeous
colours but also because of their buoyant and distinctive flight. As
they are rather weak-billed and might not be entirely safe from
owls, it is well to treat them as day-liberty birds. The process of
training a day-liberty cock is as follows. An aviary must be prepared

next to that occupied by the bird's mate and he is placed in it and
accustomed to feed from a dish on a bracket in the front of the flight,
opposite which is a small door about a foot in diameter. When he is
thoroughly accustomed to this feeding place, the door may be left
open and he may be allowed to find his way out. During the first
day or two he must be carefully watched so that he may be assisted in
finding his way back inside the aviary when he gets hungry. At first
it is often a good plan to have a second dish of seed husks and rubbish
which looks like seed on the outside of the aviary close against the
entrance door, and exactly opposite the dish containing real seed
within. A suitable arrangement of perches should make it easy for
the bird to find his way to this dish and thence inside, for when he
discovers that the outside dish contains practically nothing worth
eating, he will soon move to the second dish inside, from which he has
been accustomed to feed. For the first day or two it may be well to
dispense with the funnel of wire-netting which is introduced later, and
shut the bird into the aviary when he has entered for his afternoon
feed. The funnel should consist of a tube of wire-netting of suitable
size and length on a small wooden frame which can be pushed into
the small entrance door at mid-day in winter and proportionately
later as the days get longer. A bird entering the aviary through the
funnel to feed cannot normally find his way out again, and is thus
safely confined for the night. The end of the funnel should be quite
close to the inside feeding dish, but, especially when birds are
accustomed to its use, it should be so arranged and should be of such
a length, that a bird entering it to feed from the dish cannot easily
find its way out again by stepping from the dish into the mouth of the
funnel. This is particularly necessary in the case of Crimson-wings,
which are rather intelligent birds. Later, if such a course of action
should be advisable to prevent the nuisance of wild British birds getting
into the aviary to steal the seed the main feeding dish can be placed
inside the shelter where the bird has at some time or other been
accustomed to find it. For a while the outside dish should be left to
act as a bait, even though it may no longer contain anything but seed
husks, but later when the bird has been thoroughly well trained,
even this dish can be dispensed with.
It is impossible to keep hen Crimson-wings at liberty, not because
they stray badly, but because they insist in going down the chimneys
of houses, ultimately coming to an untimely end.
Barraband's Parrakeet is another most attractive day-liberty bird,
but it is essential to confine it at night or in winter it is certain to be
destroyed by owls. A cock Barraband who knows where his mate is
confined will never leave the vicinity of her aviary, but it is essential
to use a wild bird for this purpose as aviary-bred ones behave extremely
foolishly when first released and are apt to loose their heads and their

way. A wild cock may fly backwards and forwards in rather an
alarming way with his swift and lofty flight, but, if his mate calls,
well there is little risk of losing him, and once he has come down on to
the aviary there is no danger that he will leave her. It is, however,
very important that her aviary should be next to the one in which the
cock spends the night as, if the liberty aviary is too far from the hen's
aviary, the cock will be reluctant to enter it unless very hungry, as
he will dislike being out of sight of his mate. Young birds may some-
times be flown at liberty with their father, being trained one by one.
The speed and grace of their flight when they are in a frisky mood
is a joy to watch, and no British bird can show anything comparable.
Unfortunately, however, after a few weeks, young Polyteline Parrakeets
become uncertain stayers and should be caught up and disposed of.
If the owner is tempted to take a chance with them, he can wait until
they spend one night out, returning on the following day, but this is
definitely a danger signal, and if it should be ignored they will return
no more. Young hens are even worse stayers at liberty than cocks,
and are hardly worth training.
The Rock Peplar Parrakeet, while less ornamental in plumage is,
if possible an even more beautiful flyer at liberty than the Barraband
and its treatment and handling should be the same. Cocks of both
species will agree tolerably well in the liberty aviary out of the breeding
season, but are likely to become quarrelsome about February or
March, when they must be returned to their partners.
I have had some success with Peachfaced Lovebirds at liberty
during the summer only, as this species is not altogether hardy. When
Lovebirds are released, it is necessary to provide them with plenty of
nest-boxes covered with wire-netting if there is a danger of grey
squirrels gnawing the wood. The size of the entrance hole must also
be very carefully regulated by means of experiments with living birds,
being just large enough to admit the Lovebirds, but too small to admit
Starlings, which will otherwise take possession of every box. A metal
ring round the entrance hole will prevent undesirable British birds
from enlarging it. Madagascar Lovebirds I have also bred at liberty,
but they, too, must be taken in during the winter, and care must of
course be taken to make sure that parents with young still in the nest
are not caught up in the autumn. This applies to all birds which do
not stop breeding when the summer is over.
Red-faced Lovebirds I kept successfully at liberty throughout the
year, but even under these conditions they made no attempt to nest.
The beautiful little Passerine Parrotlet, or Blue-winged Lovebird,
I have also bred at liberty during the summer months. They should
be caught up for the winter with the usual precautions with regard
to late nests. When in good condition they are unfortunately very
savage and quarrelsome, and adult pairs must be kept separate.

It is only birds in rather poor condition that can safely be crowded
together like Budgerigars.
Budgerigars, after some initial failures, I have now succeeded in
establishing as day-liberty birds which return to the aviary to feed
and nest.
The flight for a liberty aviary for Budgerigars should contain far
more protection from wind and wet than an ordinary flight. A wide
portion of the centre, and a smaller portion of the two ends should be
covered over with some waterproof material. The nest-boxes should be
hung almost all th# way round the top of the aviary flight, and they, too,
should have some overhead and side protection from direct sun, wind,
and wet. There should be about three times as many boxes as there
are hens to start with, and there should be a wooden partition between
each nest to prevent a jealous hen sitting outside her own nest, from
seeing other hens sitting outside theirs and being tempted to attack
them.
In one corner of the flight, preferably near the entrance hole to the
shelter, an exit hole in the wire-netting roof should be constructed
6 inches in diameter. When the exit is in use a moveable cross-piece
of wire should be fixed over it to prevent the entry of such large birds
as Sparrowhawks. Immediately underneath the exit hole there
should be a box containing seed, which should be cleaned out once
a week. In the floor of this box there should be some drainage holes
and the sides should be made climbable with wire-netting in case the
box should fill with water during heavy rain in spite of the drainage
holes. Immediately beneath the exit hole there should be suspended
a removable ladder of little perches, the top rung of which is 4J inches
below the hole, while the bottom rung reaches nearly to the seed in
the feeding box. An extra dish of seed should be provided inside the
shelter which must be well-lighted, dry, and cosy, and liberally
furnished with small perches near the roof. In the flight, in addition
to permanent perches, there should be plenty of natural branches,
changed when they become dirty, under the sheltered portions. In
summer these branches should be stripped of leaves before they are
put in place as if this is not done they tempt birds to roost in the flight
and not in the shelter. It is sometimes desirable to alter the height
of the top rung of the exit ladder. If it is 5 \ inches below the cross-piece
of wire over the hole it will make exit difficult and tend to confine to
the aviary birds untrained to fly at liberty which are likely to stray ;
and also very newly-fledged and helpless young ones. The higher up
the top rung, the easier the exit.
In order to confine the birds at* night and prevent them from being
taken by owls, a wire-netting funnel, 3J inches in length, 4 inches in
diameter at the entrance, and if inches in diameter at the tip, should
be constructed. Every afternoon, at least three hours before sunset,

the ladder should be unhooked ; the cross-piece of wire removed ;
and the funnel inserted until the following morning when, as soon
after daybreak as convenient, the funnel is removed and the ladder
and cross-piece of wire again placed in position.
If a start has to be made with birds that are not trained homers--
and even the latter are used--the same procedure is not inadvisable
in the strange place--the Budgerigars should be confined to the aviary
until the young of the first round are leaving the nest, when the exit
hole can be allowed to operate. It will probably then be found that
few of the breeding birds trouble to go out, but of those that do, some
may stray and be lost while a few may return and prove homers.
Losses from straying are likely to be much greater among cocks than
among hens. Practically all the young birds will soon find their way
in and out and for a short time nearly all will stay, but during the
ensuing eight weeks a considerable number will wander away. At
the end of that period, those that remain will be beginning to come
into breeding condition, and the hens will make their choice from
among the vacant nest-boxes. Although this early breeding would be
considered inadvisable with birds that are confined, it does no harm
to young liberty birds to have one nest, provided they lay before
15th August. After that date all hens that start entering the nest-
boxes should be removed to the adjoining " resting " aviary in which
hens are confined to prevent unseasonable or excessive breeding and
in which the adult females are also placed directly they finish rearing
their second brood and start making preparations for the third.
Cocks should never be confined as, if they are shut up for very long
periods, they may stray when again released, but hens once they have
bred in the aviary do not forget their homing. The " non-exits "
which never go out at all, usually also remain " non-exits 5 \
Care should be taken to watch the behaviour of the young hens
which are coming into breeding condition, to see that they do not enter
undefended nest-boxes containing young that have not yet flown and
injure the latter. Such hens should be got rid of as they are unsuited
to a community aviary. As a check on their activities, breeding hens
which always lay their second clutches in the same nest as the first,
are preferable to those which seek new nest-boxes for their second
broods, and are therefore not in a position to protect the youngest
members of their family from invaders.
When it is desired to add new colours to a liberty aviary, it is on
the whole best to obtain young hens which have not yet bred, and
confine them to the aviary for a few days until they have chosen their
nest-boxes and mates. Although this method of introducing new
colours is not ideal, especially with the sex-linked varieties, it is on
the whole preferable to the alternative plan of introducing new cocks
as the latter so often stray and, in addition, are apt to get ill more

frequently than birds that are acclimatized to the aviary. Hens which
have nested by themselves in cages or small single compartment
aviaries, are apt to be troublesome in a community aviary as they
seem to experience great difficulty in deciding which box to choose
and are more prone to disregard their neighbour's rights of property
and quarrel with other hens already nesting, sometimes with dangerous
results.
Late February or early March, according to the season, is the best
time to begin putting up the majority of pairs for breeding, but, as
the most attractive show with Budgerigars at liberty is provided by
the young birds (the breeding adults being rather stay-at-home), it is
desirable, while avoiding over-breeding from individual pairs, to have
a succession of young leaving the nest over as long a period as possible.
If the owner of the birds does not live too far north, and if the season
is not too severe, it is sometimes possible to arrange for one or two
early broods to leave the nest from the middle of March onwards.
For the production of these, strong, fully-matured hens which have
not been overworked during the previous season, should be selected.
Care must be taken to see that their water does not freeze, by using a
night-light in a small box underneath the water dish, so arranged
that the contents of the latter, while never too hot, are also always
liquid. Spinach beet in moderation and any chickweed that can
be found must be provided, as well as a little sweetened milk-sop.
It will usually be found that the majority of the hens in an aviary
prefer nest-boxes with the entrances facing north. If this should
prove to be the case, in order to prevent the main breeding team of
hens disturbing and interfering with the early breeders, when they
are first put into the aviary, it is well to remove, for a time, all the
nest-boxes which have the most favoured aspect, and oblige the early
breeders to use the boxes which are not likely later to be in any great
demand. In general, however, nest-boxes should be left up in the
aviary throughout the year and only taken down for cleaning purposes.
The cocks enjoy fussing around them, even when they are not mated,
and I think the presence of the boxes tends to promote their attach-
ment to their home.
As a rule, only about 25 per cent of the young bred from non-homing
parents prove homers, but percentages tend to improve by about
25 per cent with each succeeding generation. The really established
birds are as faithful to their homes as homing Pigeons, and rarely go
more than a hundred yards from their aviary.
Liberty Budgerigars have the great merit of being completely
harmless to fruit and vegetation, and of all foreign birds the most
decorative. It is naturally desirable to place the liberty aviary close
to a tree, and if there is an evergreen shrub with rather sparse foliage
also in the immediate vicinity, it will prove attractive.

On 7th July, 1952, a hybrid Screamer baby was hatched by its
parents in the Scripps' Flight Cage, Zoological Gardens of San Diego,
California. The male parent was a Black-necked Screamer, Chauna
chav aria (Linne) and the female, a Crested Screamer, Chauna torquata
(Oken). Due to the great size of the cage and the shielded location
of the nest, the exact incubation period could not be determined, but
it is to be assumed that it was about forty-four days, in other words,
approximately that of the Black-necked Screamer, of which many
have been hatched here in the Zoo. Mr. Lint, Curator of Birds,
removed the adults and the chick, shown in the accompanying photo-
graph, and placed them in isolated quarters where the young bird
might have a better chance for survival.

By Ir. F. J. Appelman (Rotterdam, Flolland)
In 1950, Mrs. Belle J. Benchley was so kind as to let the Rotterdam
Zoo have a male and a female Ocellated Turkey, reared in the San
Diego Zoo. They were young adult birds, already in fine plumage.
In 1951, the hen laid 18 eggs, unluckily all infertile ; the cock seemed
too young, for he did not display.
This year (1952) the hen laid 31 eggs, and during the whole time
the cock wooed his hen constantly and never stopped displaying for
nearly six weeks. The result was 22 fertile eggs. These were brooded
partly in the incubator (12 eggs) partly under tame turkeys (1 o eggs).
Fifteen eggs hatched, but some of the youngsters had badly crooked
toes and some others crooked necks. Therefore we had to dispose of
three inferior youngsters, and one was eaten by rats.
At the moment of writing this small article (August, 1952) we still
have eleven fine young Ocellated Turkeys, which are doing exceedingly
well.
Contrary to what has been written in M. Delacour's article in the
July-August number of this Magazine, we had little trouble in raising
the young Ocellated Turkeys. The oldest are already getting their
glorious plumage. In our opinion, however, they are by no means
growing as fast as the youngsters of common tame turkeys, and we
wonder if this is only normal for this species.

By Charles Cordier (New York, U.S.A.)
It has been my lot to collect in Ecuador twice, with an interval of two
years. During my first collecting trip the feeding of the above birds pre-
sented an almost insoluble problem. These birds were tried, of course,
on our standard Tanager food made up of boiled brown rice, washed
with cold water after cooking to get the stickiness out, boiled minced
fowl's eggs (one egg per ten medium sized Tanagers), grated carrots,
soaked currants if available, dried off with Zwieback-meal and
Pablum, a pre-cooked cereal. The proportion of Zwieback-meal
(bread crumbs) and Pablum is three of the former to one of the latter.
Some of these birds would take to the food, which is ideal for
Tanagers, but after a few days or weeks would taper off their food-
intake and die. All of these species learn to like diced bananas, of
course. However, the kind of bananas sold in the temperate zone and
praised so highly for their nutritional value, will not sustain the life
of a bird for more than a few weeks or months at the most. Another
matter are certain types of bananas called plantains which are much
more nourishing and will keep birds healthy for years. Not being
readily available in the markets of the temperate zone, one might, as
well, forget about them.
I have often had the opportunity of observing the feeding habits of
these species in nature and noticed that most of them consume great
quantities of mistletoe berries of which certain kinds attain the size of
small cherries. Others, again, go for small whitish berries which seem
to contain very little nourishment. Next time you see your Euphonia
whipping its tail after expelling waste do not worry, it happens in the
wilds. Besides the very great quantities of berries these birds consume
daily, it can be safely assumed they occasionally do get hold of some
insects.
In order to duplicate their natural food as nearly as possible, I hit
upon the idea of making a paste, consisting of the above described
Tanager-food and bananas, by taking equal proportions of each and
mixing them thoroughly with a fork. In late afternoon this paste is
discarded and replaced by bananas and other ripe fruit in season, such
as pears, blue-berries, grapes, cherries.
This way of feeding is also ideal for Sugar Birds. The paste is not
over-nourishing, contains enough proteins and is moist, exactly to their
liking.

A. GENERAL.
The native Teal differs, to its discredit, from almost all other
Anatinae, even from its close North American relative, JV. carolinensis ,
in being one of the most stubbornly shy birds I know. Neither free
on the pond, nor enclosed in a small yard, did wild-caught Teals
ever become passably tame with me, so that in spite of painstaking and
careful observation through field-glasses I know less about their
behaviour than about any other bird I have kept. Next year I hope
to get eggs and breed a number of young tame Teals.
In colouring the Teal has much in common with the Mallard and
the Chestnut-breasted Teal. As in both of these, the colour of the head
contrasts sharply with that of the neck, while the speculum is black
and green like that of the Chestnut-breasted. The speculum of
JV. jlavirostre is even more like that of Virago. Teal ducklings and those
of its Chilian relation, JV. Jlavirostre , have a peculiar head marking, an
almost uniform dark colour on the sides of the head.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
While in every respect the female is like a small edition of the female
Mallard, the drake differs from the Mallard drake in being com-
pletely voiceless. The " krick " whistle, his only call, which is certainly
homologous to that of the Chestnut-breasted drake, combines the
functions of call-note and warning, like that of the Chestnut-breasted.
Although the " krick " whistle is used in the social play of drakes, it
has, because of its frequent use, entirely lost its significance as a court-
ship call and has become, in every respect, the sole representative of
those calls of the Mallard which belong to the class of non-whistling
sounds. Teals whistle under circumstances in which no other surface-
feeding drakes do, for example, in fear when a person is coming near
their pen.
G. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.

I would not say that it is lacking in the species, a thing I can definitely
say about JV. flavirostre. In all other actions and calls the European
Teal is exactly like the Mallard except that her voice, because of her
small size, is pitched higher.

1. The General Form of Display.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9590685" page_id="56291636"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
The ceremoniousness and solemnity of display is at least as great as
it is with the Mallard. The drakes have to move together, get into the
right position, shake their bills, etc., for a long time before the first
whistle comes. Unlike the Mallard, but similar to the Pintail, Bahama,
and Garganey Teal, they try to procure the presence of the female,
and should the latter swim away they interrupt their display in order
to swim in pursuit of her. Having come up to her, they start over
again with the moving together and the shaking. In other respects
their dance looks much like a film of the Mallard which is run off
too fast. All the movements and whistles as well as the repeated
drinking acts, shaking, etc., follow each other so fast and in such haste
that the observer cannot get his breath. The whistling of my four
drakes sounded as though it were continuous. Then the display dies
down abruptly and one is aware he has seen and noted only a fraction
of the acts.
2. The Drinking and Introductory Shaking.
These are exactly like those of the Mallard, except that they do not
last as long and, corresponding to the smaller size of the species, the
rising and dying off of each emotion follows more quickly than in
Anas. I have never noted mock-preening.

coverts, cut sharply by the black, are instantaneously spread and show
to good advantage. The head-up-tail-up occurs in two different
connections. The connection that I have seen most frequently is
marked by the lack of the succeeding burping. Instead of this,
there is chin-lifting without lifting the head, or stretching the neck.
In another sequence of acts, which seemed to occur at moments of
greater intensity, the head-up-tail-up is immediately followed by
burping, just as in the case of the Mallard. This burping is always
accompanied by a very intense turning of the head towards the female
(Fig. 35). The head does not go very high. When it has reached its
highest point, a " krick 55 whistle follows. From the fact that the
whistle occurs, in this case, in the same connections as the usual
burping whistle occurs in the Pintail and the Chestnut-breasted
it seems certain that it has been derived genetically from the latter.

the European Teal. Notice the
optical effect of the yellow triangles
of the sides of the tail. Compare

Fig. 35.--The burping of the Euro-
pean Teal drake, Nettion crecca (L).
Compare with Figs. 20, 24, 39, 46, 50.
As in the Mallard, the burping never comes as an isolated action but
in conjunction with the head-up-tail-up. While the head is being
raised, those feathers of the head and neck which had been lying on
the back remain pressed together sleekly, as if they had lost all
elasticity. The back edge, with which the contour of the head merged
into the back when the head was drawn in, now stands out sharply
and forms a little tuft at the back of the head. That is precisely why
it is there and it has the same function in N. Jlavirostre , in whose
case the morphological differentiation of the tuft goes further.

The head goes even further back than in Virago if that is possible.
In his description of the Teal and Mallard display, Wormald has put
this bridling with the head-up-tail-up, for he says, concerning the
Mallard's head-up-tail-up, that the same movement is still more
developed in the Teal. He says " he makes his head and tail meet
over his back ". Doubtless he meant the bridling movement, which

is in no way homologous with the head-up-tail-up in accordance with
all we have said. The whistle uttered has one syllable.
7. Chin-lifting.
This always follows very slowly and is usually apart from the
courtship-play proper. As with the Chestnut-breasted drake, the
position is held for a long time. The head lies deep in the neck, as it
does in this act with the Wigeons. The significance of the movement
is the same as it is in the Mallard. One sees it repeated again and
again by the drake that is " politely " solicitous for the comfort of
his duck.
8. Turning the Back of the Head.
This is not performed while holding the head high with raised bill
and smoothly lying feathers, as we have seen in the Mallard, Chesnut-
breasted, and Carolina drakes (Fig. 15). Rather, the head is indrawn,
the neck expanded, and the plumage of the head and neck is puffed
out as in the Pintail (see Fig. 23). I had suspected this because of the
pattern of the markings and the structure of the feathers.

Nettion flavirostre (Vieillot)
A. GENERAL.
This species is doubtless very closely related to JV. crecca. It is,
however, much more highly specialized in a very distinctive manner.
The two sexes, being altogether the same colour, which is perhaps
connected with the fact that the males take care of the young, would
not be in itself an important taxonomic character (think of the corre-
sponding difference of the closely related Anas species) as are the
instinctive actions of the drake's care of the young. Worthy of note
is a surprising convergence toward the geese, in which group the male
also takes care of the young. This convergence lies in the fact that
an action, signifying an originally hostile threat, has become the
expression of a greeting always occurring upon the union of a family.
Quite unique in the Anatina is the fact that the action is performed
by the day-old duckling, just as young geese stretch out their necks.
The great similarity which exists in the colour of the bills and plumage
in N. flavirostre and D. spinicauda is a point emphasized by many
classifiers. On account of that, Boetticher has created the genus
Dafilonettium for the Chilian Teal, and has placed it as an intermediate
between the Teal and the Pintail. I cannot agree with this opinion in
any respect. In spite of all peculiarities N. flavirostre is a true Teal as
far as behaviour, actions, and the plumage of the ducklings are con-

cerned, and is doubtlessly much more nearly related to the Chestnut-
breasted Duck than to D. spinicauda. Remember the colour of the
speculum, the whistle connected with the bridling movement, and the
" krick " whistle. The similarity of the colour of the bill probably rests
on corresponding mutations which can bring forth absolutely similar
colour designs even without blood relationship as, for example, the
so-called " markings 55 on the wings of very different kinds of wild and
tame pigeons. Anas undulata has almost the same markings on the bill,
although it is not closely related to jV. flavirostre or D. spinicauda. The
plumage of these two species are, moreover, alike only in colouring
and not at all in the fine markings, which in flavirostre are clearly Teal
markings.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
Conversation and call-notes of both sexes correspond in general to
those of N. crecca. Besides the latter, it is the only species that I know
Figs. 36-37. -- The first and second phase of the gesture of greeting of the Chilian Teal
drake.
the drake of which can whistle without any head or neck movement.
The ordinary call-note and warning whistle is used even more easily
and frequently than is that of the Teal ; it consists of one syllable,
but sometimes it is uttered in such quick succession that it resembles
the conversation-call of the Mallard, both in rhythm and meaning.
One can say that in the drake of N. flavirostre the substitution of the
ordinary conversation-call by the courtship-whistle is carried furthest.
In addition to this, on any excitement, especially when he finds his
mate after a short separation, the male performs a most peculiar,
indeed unique, ceremony of greeting which has nothing to do with the
display proper, and is never used in connection with social display.
The drake stretches his head, with the bill held horizontally close to the
ground, just as all surface-feeding drakes do, including the domestic
drake, when they are threatening. During this action he utters a
rapid and many syllabled twittering, perhaps like " rutiu-tiu tiu
tiu tiu ". Before his head is stretched out it is bent straight down
(Fig. 36), and the tuft on the neck sticks straight up. The next moment
the tuft disappears completely with the goose-like stretching of the
neck (Fig. 37). The drake very often answers the female's inciting with
this action. My flavirostre duck laid three eggs and then deserted them.
I let a bantam hen hatch them and I got three healthy ducklings. To

my boundless astonishment all three ducklings answered my imitation
of the duck's leading call with a fully developed greeting ceremony.
Their twittering did not sound any different from that of any old drake.
The ducklings greeted me and each other with this ceremony after
each separation. It could be elicited in other, less specific, circum-
stances. The way it is performed and the circumstances which call
forth the head stretching and greeting are astonishingly similar to
those eliciting " greeting " in Grey Lags and other geese. In comparing
the two clearly analogous actions of Anser and Nettion the problem of
origin is interesting. Both spring from one homologous root, namely out
of the threatening stretching forth of the neck, which with few excep-
tions ( Chlmphaga ) are peculiar to all Anatidce. But the process of evolving
a " ceremony of friendship " out of a gesture of threat has surely been
gone through independently by Anser and Nettion. The common root
of this convergency very probably lies in the male's taking care of the
young. It is an interesting and thought-provoking case in connection
with developing ideas concerning homology and analogy. As all my
three flavirostre ducklings developed into drakes, unfortunately I do not
know whether young females also perform this action and lose it later
or whether sex dimorphism is developed fully on the first day. Both
answers would be very interesting.

This is like that of the European Teal, but has definite and certainly
significant similarity with the characteristic cadence of the Chestnut-
breasted Duck. The head moves well downward and backward, like
that of the Mallard. The body is not held up as in the case of Dajila

This holds the record among all surface-feeding ducks for the
number of syllables. The second syllable is loudest, as in the case of
the Mallard and European Teal. I counted up to twenty-one syllables
which, gradually sinking in volume and pitch, gave the impression that
the duck was going further away from the hearer as she was calling.

is the case with Pintails and Garganeys, that swim after a female.
They must first move together and shake. My four drakes paid less
attention to the presence of the female
than the European Teal does, but
more than the Mallard and Mandarin.
The slow, measured succession of
the single acts resembles neither the
hurried display of the European Teal
nor the restless swimming around of
the drakes of D. spinicauda in display.
On the other hand, one is reminded
of the European Teal by the circum-
stance that almost every individual
display act is repeated frequently so that one appreciates that the
movements are literally identical.

Since the head-up-tail-up is lacking, burping occurs as an absolutely
independent act, not linked with any other. It reminds one of the
burping of the Mallard, Pintail, and European Teal, which is linked
to the head-up-tail-up inasmuch as it is always accompanied by the
turning of the head to the female. During this head turning (the

head plumage is a surprisingly high and narrow disk) the tuft on the
back of the head points straight out like a thorn. The disk and tuft
make a very striking picture and there can be hardly a doubt that the
function of the lengthened feathers, which almost form a hood, lies in
the optical effect of this movement (Fig. 39). A structural peculiarity
lies in the fact that the feathers of the temples and sides of the head are
lengthened much more than those of the top of the head. The result is
a " disk coiffure ", a flat lens form with sharp edges up in the middle
line. This is in contrast to the " coiffure " of the Mallard, European
Teal, Carolina, and Mandarin drakes,
in which the upper side of the head is
set off by a sharp, clear edge against
the sides. In burping, the whistle is
almost always two-syllabled, like that

Chaulelasmus streperus (L.)
A. GENERAL.
Closely related though the Gadwall is to the Mallard in many
respects, it represents a deviation in a direction which leads away from
the main group of surface-feeding ducks, and moves it near the
Wigeons. These are a group by themselves, far removed from all other
surface-feeding ducks anatomically, in manner of life and movements,
and in colouring and plumage of ducklings. Besides that, it is well
known that when Wigeons mate with Anas sterile hybrids are produced.
When the Gadwall mates with either kind, hybrids are produced
which have good powers of reproduction. The Gadwall stands
between Anas and the Wigeons. On the other hand, there are affinities
with the Teal, for the Falcated Teal (Anas falcata) is, as indicated by
markings on its feathers, a peculiar link between Chaulelasmus and
JVettion.

The female and the ducklings have all the calls and actions of the
Mallard. In addition to this they perform a very distinctive action,
which is fully developed only in the Mallard drake (hardly suggested
in the Mallard female and lacking in the ducklings)--the chin-lifting,
During excitement, such as when one drives them into a corner, or
when they press around their keeper asking for food, or when they
find each other after separation, even little ducklings perform this
action and utter a two-syllabled call in the rhythm that we find in the
" raebraeb " palavers of the Mallards. When performed by a brood of
ducklings the ceremony is more like a triumph-cry than is observed in
the case of Mallards. When the mother joins in the ceremony, as she
undoubtedly normally does, the analogy is even clearer than with my
motherless ducklings. The corresponding action of Wigeons has quite
clearly taken over the function of a triumph cry. The two-syllabled
conversation call is lacking in the drake. However, he has a softly
breathed call-note which certainly corresponds to the " raeaeb " of
the Mallard drake.

<bodyText confidence="0.999320928571428" page_id="56291643"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
The inciting of the duck is very peculiar. The real inciting move-
ment over the shoulder alternates regularly with the movement of chin-
lifting. The drake reacts immediately to inciting by lifting his chin,
which movement I shall describe in more detail later. The cadence of
the sound is that proper to inciting in surface-feeding ducks, but at the
same time one can hear in it the rhythm of the Mallard's " raebraeb "
palaver. To follow Heinroth's example in making a sentence that suits
the rhythm, we shall say in good south German dialect " So gehn's
weg do So " (You go on away there, you). This sentence gives the
meaning of the ceremony, too, which generally takes place when two
pairs try to annoy each other and drive each other away, in the manner
of Wigeons. As in the Carolina and Mandarin ducks, as well as in
Amazonetta and Casarcime, the inciting female at times touches the
breast of the drake with her bill.

The Gadwall and the Wigeons differ fundamentally from all the
other surface-feeding drakes (with the possible exception of the
Shoveler) in that a definite social play in the sense of the gathering of
several drakes is lacking. Similarly to the Carolina one notices
display actions and calls, mostly when two pairs are aggravating each
other or when two or more drakes are paying attention to one female.
Any positive reactions the drakes have upon each other, such as
observed among surface-feeding ducks and in the Mandarin, are
lacking in the Gadwall. Although social play of drakes is lacking, the
Gadwall performs actions which certainly correspond to those of social
display of other surface-feeding ducks. This is not so surprising, as
instinctive movements often prove to be more conservative in evolution
than do the concomitant orientation reactions. Even the introduction
to display is like that of other drakes. The Gadwall drake, swimming
after his duck, uses shaking and mock-preening as self-stimulation
in a way very similar to that of other surface-feeding drakes.

<bodyText confidence="0.995350933333334" page_id="56291644"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
These play a special role in the Gadwall. Both movements have
merged into a firmly linked ceremony. In the Mallard the drinking
and mock-preening follow no set order, with the result that one could
hardly prove the function of these actions to a person who was rather
unwilling to be convinced. In the Gadwall the ceremony is very clear.
Drinking always follows immediately after mock-preening. The evolu-
tional development of the introductory movements is all the more
interesting since we know a case in which the component acts occur in
reverse order, namely in the performance of the Mandarin, wherein
drinking always precedes mock-preening. As in the Mandarin, so in
the Gadwall, there has taken place, parallel to the higher differentia-
tion of the mock-preening, a higher differentiation of the plumage.
This becomes apparent during mock-preening. The most strikingly
coloured feathers on the specula and the large wing coverts are
exactly at the spot which is lifted and moved by the preening bill.

This is highly differentiated. In a way it is more like that of the

without the head-up-tail-up, and it is one of the most frequent actions
of the Gadwall's display. The call, which obviously requires the lifting

of the head and the stretching of the windpipe in order to bring it
forth, is a very strange nasal-pitched tone midway between " oe 55 and

the Gadwall can be compared to the Mallard's " raeb In volume
the Gadwall's burp reminds one much more of the long drawn out
" r ae ae b " of the Mallard, which represents the latter's call- and
warning-notes, than of the corresponding call of the Pintail, which is
often accompanied by a whistle. I have never heard a whistle in the
Gadwall's burp. But the Gadwall utters, independently from the
grunting " o ", a softly breathed call-note, which to me certainly
seems homologous to that of the Mallard.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981231540540541" page_id="56291645"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
Even the Gadwall uses this action. With him it is peculiarly incom-
plete, broken off short. The body is not lifted up nearly as much as
with other surface-feeding ducks. The normal position follows very
quickly and the bent-down position of the head is held extremely
briefly. The head is thrust up again immediately, but it is held close to
the neck. While the head is being bent downward a piercing grunt
tone is heard. This is followed by a fine, sharp whistle, occurring as
a smooth transition. The grunt tone sounds like " oeh " ; so the whole
thing sounds like " oe oe oe i i i ". The order of grunt and whistle is
exactly reverse to that of the Mallard.
6. Head-up-tail-up.
In the Gadwall drake this is strangely enough linked with the
down-up act, which with him does not occur as an isolated act of
display. The rump is not lifted nearly as high as with the Mallard. On
the other hand, the following burp is
very pronounced and it is linked with
a pronounced turning of the head
towards the duck. The movement of
the rump, in spite of its small degree, is
very effective, because of the ruffling of
the very long, thick, deep black upper
and lower tail coverts (Fig. 41). The
head-up-tail-up is followed occasionally
by a slight swimming forward, which
has no hint of head-nodding, but ter-
minates in an extreme turning back of
the head, in the same way as the
the Mallard's nod-swimming ends. Much more frequently, indeed,
almost always, the down-up act follows the head-up-tail-up, being
linked with it and the burp.

the Gadwall drake, Chaulelasmus
streperus (L). Notice the parts
of the plumage which are
especially prominent, and com-
pare with those in Figs. 12, 22, 25,

This occurs only in the above-mentioned connection. This is a poor
name for this action of the Gadwall's, as the downward movement is
very slight while, on the other hand, the following lifting of the chin is
very pronounced.
8. Chin-lifting.
As already mentioned in discussing the actions of the female, the
chin-lifting plays a very important part with the Gadwall because of
its significance as a ceremony, analogous to the triumph-cry of Anserine
and Casarcim. The rhythm suggested in the Mallard's " raeb raeb "
palaver ; long-short, long-short, long, is found in both sexes of the
Fig. 42.--The mutual chin-lifting of the
Gadwall pair. The arrow indicates the
direction of the sideward inciting move-
ment which is added between every two
liftings of the chin. Compare Figs. 3, 44,
and 45.
Gadwall, both in the female's inciting and the drake's action which
I am about to describe. In response to the duck's inciting, the drake
lifts his chin well past the horizontal, without having lowered it first,
while his body at the base of the neck sinks very considerably into the
water. As a rule this chin-raising is repeated three times, corresponding
to the rhythm I have described. When he raises the chin for the first
and last time, he utters a grunt, but at the middle one, he utters a shrill
whistle. Thus, the whole phrase sounds like this " oeh, oe--ee--oe,
oeh ". Simultaneously with this action of the male, the female performs
her alternating inciting and chin-raising (Fig. 42). Generally this
inciting coincides with the drake's whistle, thus it is given in unison,
with the phonetic phrase we have given for the male. The amazingly
fixed correlation of the sounds of both mates reminds one very much of
the corresponding " triumph-ceremonies " in Wigeons which also
are accompanied by chin-raising. The employment of this action when
a pair are aggravating each other, the lack of seriousness in a combat,
the short effect of " victory ", are also exactly the same as in the
Wigeons. At moments of small intensity, the drake's utterance
shortens to two sounds, a whistle with an accompanying grunt. One
hears this very often.

This also plays a great role in the Gadwall's wooing. In this the
head feathers take a very extreme and striking position. The plumage
of the forehead is ruffled until it is broad and round and therefore looks
dark. The feathers on the top of the head form a high ridge along the
middle line. At the back of the head the feathers are ruffled to the
highest degree possible, forming a broad area which appears almost
black. When the head is drawn in, at the position taken at
Fig. 43.--The turning back of the head of
the Gadwall drake. The dark area on the
back of the head is formed by the position,
not by the dark colour of the feathers.
Compare Figs. 15, 23, 26.
the beginning of display, this area lies on the back. But before the
movement we are speaking of, the head is lifted just high enough so
that the area can be seen, and then the head is turned to the female.
The dark cushion at the back of the Gadwall's head is in such contrast
to the colour of the rest of the head that a person knowing the drake
only in this position of the feathers would say that the back of its head
was dark, like that of the Pintail.
10. The Combat of the Drakes.
This is just like that of the Mallards. I have never seen the mating
and the post-coital play.

Members of the Club, 33 ; guests, 21 ; total, 54.
After the Loyal Toast the Chairman proposed the health of our
Patron, Alfred Ezra, who celebrated his eightieth birthday on
6th September ; the response was, of course, vociferous.
Introducing Walter Higham, the Chairman described him as the
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.957472304347826" page_id="56291648"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
foremost colour-film bird photographer in Europe if not in the
world. After seeing his " Broadland Birds 55 one could be left with
little doubt that Walter Higham was more than worthy of this
description.
The Hickling and Horsey bird sanctuaries are world-famous, and
the film deals chiefly with the wild-birds and wild-life frequenting
this part of the Norfolk Broads. Rare British breeding birds such as
the Bittern, Marsh-Harrier, Montagu's Harrier, and Bearded Tit,
are pictured at the nest. Many more commonly known birds, the
Great Crested Grebe, House-Martin, Water-Rail, Coot, Moorhen,
Sedge-Warbler, Reed-Warbler, and Swans are to be seen. Birds
frequently there on migration, including the Avocet, Stilt, Spoonbill,
and Wood-Sandpiper are also in the film.
Some of the more interesting features are the pictures of a Water-
Rail carrying a chick, a Bittern eating its dead chick, Martins collecting
mud and nest-building, and slow motion pictures of Swans taking off
the water, using their feet in the process. A part that gave great
pleasure to many members showed Roland Green at work in his
garden.
At the conclusion the spontaneous and sustained applause proved
that Walter Higham's latest film is indeed a triumph of colour
photography.
The next meeting of the Club is on 12th November, 1952.

W. G. Baird, Palmerston North, N.Z. says : No doubt you know
that the Parrot ban has now been partly lifted in New Zealand. At
present the lifting only applies to birds from Australia, but that
alone will be a big help, except prices have sky-rocketed in Australia,
but apart from that we now have the opportunity of stocking our
aviaries which is the main thing. I am hoping to get a few across
in the near future, and hope they will survive our present cold
weather. If one waits till later it means missing a breeding season,
so is worth the risk."

E. J. Boosey reports : "We have had quite a fair breeding season,
and the high spot has certainly been the old pair of Pileated Parra-
keets who, having already reared five excellent young ones, surprised
me by going to nest again. Their second brood consists of three
which should be out any day now, and if they do fledge successfully
the pair will have reared seventeen young ones in three seasons !
Turquoisines, on the other hand, have done badly."

K. A. Norris writes : "I have two young Leadbeaters from the
eggs which were incubated for ten days by a racing Pigeon, otherwise
breeding results have been most disappointing.
" Young GambePs Sparrows appeared well on the wing before I
realized that the old birds were even nesting. I believe they now
have another nest. Towhees and Juncos are sitting, but the Towhees
have already added one family to their meat ration, and will probably
do the same again. A pair of Evening Grosbeaks are building, and a
Mountain Blue Robin appears to be investigating nest-boxes. The
Lineolated Parrakeets again had infertile eggs, in a cage. I tried one
pair in an outdoor aviary, but had to take them in again yesterday,
as the hen very nearly curled up. Blue-winged Parrotlets seem happy
enough outside, but show no signs of nesting."

James Rooney writes from Yakima, Washington : " It may interest
you to know that the McNary Dam on the Columbia River (100 miles
south-east of here) is flooding out the islands upon which large numbers
of Great Basin Canada Geese have nested. The geese are forced to
seek new nesting areas, and there are not too many unless they go up
the smaller rivers. The proposed dam at the Dalles will also have an
adverse effect. I don't like to get such unfavourable reports on the
largest and finest of our geese. Munro tells me that a proposed power
dam in B.C. will have an adverse effect on Trumpeter Swans, too,
since it will force them to winter farther south where much shooting
has been done. He says that, if this is the case, lead poisoning will
take a heavy toll."

General Curator Lee S. Crandall retired from active administration
of the mammal and bird collections of the New York Zoological
Park on 31st July, 1952. He will, however, continue to maintain an
office at the Park, and will be engaged in the preparation of books on
the care, feeding, maintenance, and exhibition of wild animals in
captivity, based on his experience of forty-four years with the collec-
tions at the Bronx Zoo.
Mr. Lee Crandall has been an active " zoo man " since 1908, when
he became an assistant in the department of birds at the Bronx Zoo.
He was appointed curator of birds in 1920, and general curator in
1943. Mr. Candall is one of the best-known of American zoo officials,
and has an international reputation for the excellence of the bird
collection he formed at the Bronx Zoo. In 1928-29, he collected
Birds of Paradise in New Guinea, returning with what was at that
time the greatest collection of the " most beautiful birds in the world 59
ever brought out. Under his curatorship the Bronx Zoo's bird
collection has become the largest and best in any zoo in the world,
and its mammal collection has acquired many rarities not previously
shown anywhere.
Because of his knowledge of zoo practices all over the world, he has
been commissioned by the Zoological Society to write a series of books
on the techniques of zoo-keeping, a subject of increasing importance
as exhibition methods change and zoo breeding of rare wild animals
becomes more and more necessary. With the title of General Curator
Emeritus he will continue to work at the Zoological Park.

A King Penguin hatched on 7th August continues to thrive. The
father appears to have done all the work of incubation and rearing,
and the comparatively cool weather of the past six weeks has, no
doubt, been very much in the chick's favour.
Other birds bred in the menagerie include eight blue Masked
Lovebirds ; a Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet ; seventeen Carolina
Ducks ; a Red-crested Pochard ; ten Black Kalij ; two Temminck's
Tragopans ; two Common and one Black-winged Peafowl ; an
African Sacred Ibis, and a Silver Gull. The Red Jungle Fowl kept
in open pens always breed well there and do not attempt to escape.
Mr. Frost has presented an interesting Myna new to the collection,
the Nias Island Myna (. Eulabes religiosa robusta), a large bird with
particularly long occipital wattles.
The Ruffs in the Waders' Aviary which made such an attractive
exhibit with their displaying earlier in the year have been augmented
by four which were presented, together with a Greenshank ; two
Redshanks ; a Black-tailed Godwit, and two Little Ringed Plovers
( Charadrius dubius curonicus), by Monsieur Leon Lippens.
A drake Eider, hand-reared by Colonel Lumsden and presented
by him, makes a mate for the duck which laid two eggs during the
spring.
A delightful gift of birds from Mr. E. H. Hawke, of Lourenco
Marques, has just arrived. They are two East African Colies ( Colius
striatus affinis) ; two White-bellied Sun-birds ( Cinnyris leucogaster) ;
two Mariqua Sun-birds (C. bifasciatus mariquensis) ; one Scarlet-
breasted Sun-bird ( Chalcomitra gutteralis), and one Zambesi Amethyst
Sun-bird ( C . amethystina kirkii).
Other presentations include a Guinea Touraco ( Touraco persa)
and two White-eared Bulbuls ( Molpastes leucogenys leucotis).
A Black Lory ( Chalcopsitta atra), a pair of Black-headed Conures
(, Nandayus nenday ), and a Gosling's Rock Bunting (. Fringillaria tahapisi
goslingi) have been received in exchange : two Asiatic White Cranes
(Megalornis leucogeranus) , and two Keas (. Nestor notabilis) have been
purchased, and a Macklot's Pitta ( Pitta erythrogaster ) has been deposited.

main body of the book is divided into two parts, the first entitled
" Malayan Birds in the Field " with chapters on the everyday birds,
some aids to identification, and " Birds and Bird families in Malaya
The second part consists of a list of birds inhabiting the Malay Peninsula
and Peninsula Thailand, with descriptions and rather brief notes on
the habits of the common species. There are a number of rather
mediocre line drawings by the author, and sixteen plates in black
and white and colour by Mrs. Glenister, which should be an aid in
identifying species.
Singapore, before the war, was the great centre of the trade in live
birds in the East, and in the shops and market it was possible to buy
birds from India, China, and the islands of the East Indies. The
bird life of the peninsula is very rich, and is the home of many beautiful
and interesting species. It is in the jungles of Malaya that the
brilliant Fire-back Pheasants are found, and there, too, the beautiful
Peacock Pheasants, while in the heavy jungle the Ocellated or Crested
Argus and Argus Pheasant are more often heard than seen. The
former bird, according to Delacour, is unique in that it has the longest
rectrices of any bird, in fact these feathers are the longest feathers in
the bird world. Then, too, there are a number of brilliant Pittas,
Kingfishers, Barbets, and Broadbills. Unlike the Indian members
of the Grow family, however, all the Malayan species are of a sombre
hue, with the exception of the Green Magpie or Hunting Crow, which
the author calls the Blue-Green Magpie ! The great family of Babblers,
over forty in number, are for the most part rather dull coloured, but
there are exceptions ; the popular Silver-eared Mesia and the Blue-
winged Siva, well known to aviculturists. Among the Leaf-Birds and
Bulbuls there are many species frequently kept in this country, the
former mostly of a green colour, though the Fairy Bluebird is of a
shining blue and black. Among the Thrushes the Magpie-Robin and
Shama are represented by local races, and the last-named is common
in the jungles and has the reputation of being the finest songster in
the peninsula. The Sunbirds and Flower-peckers include some of the

most brilliantly-coloured birds in Malaya, such as the Scarlet Sunbird,
the Crimson Sunbird, and the Scarlet-backed Flower-pecker. For
long Singapore has been the source where many Munias were
obtained, and eight, including the Weaver-Bird, are indigenous, though
there are others which have been introduced, including the Java
Sparrow, whose original home is a matter of doubt. These are a few
of some of the delightful birds which Mr. Glenister has described in
his book.

Lovebirds and Broadtails. By Arthur A. Prestwich. London,
1952. Price ys. 6 d.
This volume of the excellent series prepared by Mr. Prestwich is the
largest, as it contains the breeding records of the Lovebirds of the
genus Agapornis , one of the most popular kept in captivity. The large
number of breeding successes and crosses testify to the fact that Love-
birds and Broadtails are most satisfactory birds for the aviculturist.
The colour varieties achieved with Lovebirds are also fully recorded.
Volume V forms a valuable addition to those already published.

PARRAKEET EYE DISEASE
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981769703703704" page_id="56291655"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
Mr. Vane's amusing and instructive " Psittacorial " in the July-August
Avicultural Magazine was particularly interesting for his account of the cure of
contagious eye disease of Australian Parrakeets with sulphonamides. Before the war
this condition was almost 100 per cent lethal. Cures have been obtained in the
larger species with instillations of mercury perchloride (John Yealland--personal
communication), but so far as I know, none of the smaller species have recovered
before the Manycoloured successfully treated by Mr. David West, Sen., with yellow
oxide of mercury and aureomycin (Avicultural Magazine, March-April, 1951),
and the Splendid cured by Mr. T. R. Holmes Watkins with sulphanilamide (Avi-
cultural Magazine, March-April, 1952).
I recently had the opportunity of treating a hen Barra band, belonging to the Duke
of Bedford, for this disease, and after failing with the whole range of available anti-
biotics, including the above remedies, finally cured her with ophthalmic Chloromycetin.
I do not know much about eye infections of birds--I doubt if very much is known--
but some consideration of analogous conditions in man may help to reconcile the
reports.
In the first place, shortage of Vitamin A in any vertebrate predisposes to eye
infection, and indeed can by itself produce an intractable and fatal eye disease
(xerophthalmia). Such a shortage may well exist in the diets of newly-caught birds
or birds on long voyages.
Conjunctival infection may be due to bacteria susceptible to sulphonamides, or
bacteria not susceptible to sulphonamides, but sensitive to penicillin, or bacteria not
susceptible to either, but sensitive to the new antibiotic drugs Aureomycin, Chloro-
myctin and Terramycin. There are also virus infections which do not respond to
sulphonamides or penicillin, but some of which respond to the " mycins ". Finally
there are a few infections which resist all the antibiotics, but may yield slowly to the
old antiseptics such as perchloride of mercury.

I cannot follow Mr. Vane in his suggestion that the complaint is due to injudicious
handling, or the inclusion of grit into the eye. The condition as I have seen it is
not in the least like a foreign body reaction and clinically appears to be a specific
disease.
I think in view of the above data, the reports of Messrs. Vane, West, and Watkins,
and my own experiments with the Barraband, it would be reasonable to treat a
further case with (i) large quantities of Vitamin A--in greenfood and in cod liver
oil seed, or better, one of the water soluble vitamin preparations now on the market ;
(2) sulphonamides--local instillation of 5 per cent sulphonilamide, plus, in a severe
case, perhaps sulphamezathine in the drinking water ; (3) if these failed, local
instillation of ophthalmic Chloromycetin (the only " mycin " at present freely available
in Great Britain--Aureomycin might be used in America) would have good hope of
success.
I would like to try to isolate the organism or organisms responsible, and put the
treatment on a truly scientific basis. To this end I should be most grateful if any
member who has a case in his collection would permit me to visit him and take
swabs for bacteriological investigation. To be of any value this would need to be done
before treatment of any kind was applied. The effort might well be fruitless, but if
successful extremely useful information might result. Would anyone interested, who
has a case and resides a reasonable car ride from London, please write to me or

TREATMENT OF COCCIDIOSIS AND EYE DISEASES

Although he may be quite right, I found Mr. Vane's remarks on the worse-than-
uselessness of sulphamezathine as a preventative of coccidiosis rather depressing,
as I had been hopefully using it for that purpose ! As a remedy for Polyteline Parrakeets
actually affected I find it of no avail, but I have cured a Bluebonnet and a Lorikeet
with it, and about 50 per cent of the Budgerigars that got ill.
It is easy to distinguish from enteritis as the droppings remain dark and rather
normal-looking, and an affected bird rarely, if ever, puts its head " under its wing
In the earliest stages a Budgerigar may show some of the signs one associates with
health, but if it be made to fly its flight will lack normal speed and briskness.
Another characteristic symptom is the caking of the droppings round the vent,
after the first day or two. Coccidiosis, here, is worse in July, and as bad in hot, dry
weather as wet ; with regard to eye disease, Dr. Lake cured a Barraband which had
proved resistant to all the newest and latest " cures ", by a 5 per cent solution of
ophthalmic Chloromycetin, a drop a minute being put in the bird's eyes for twenty
minutes on the first day and for five minutes each day during the next two weeks.

With reference to Mr. Walmsley's article, Budgerigars and other psittacine birds
stray for two entirely different reasons. Some go because they want to seek " fields
and pastures new " ; others, which have been confined in aviaries all their lives,
go because they are bewildered by the strangeness of freedom and the fear of flying
down, and lose their way, though they may have mates and young at home they do
not really wish to leave. Such birds, if they can be traced and recaptured at a distance,
may stay perfectly well if they are released a second time, for quite a short period
of freedom is enough to teach them to manage themselves in the air and come down
from a height.

COLLARED TURTLE-DOVE IN LINCOLNSHIRE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977302666666667" page_id="56291657"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
There is at the present time a dove at Middle Manton, in north Lincolnshire,
which appears to be a Collared Turtle-dove ( Streptopelia decaocto). This bird has
been in that locality since the first or second week of May, 1952, but was not examined
by an ornithologist until the end of July. It is perhaps abnormally pale on the breast
and head, but it is almost certainly the species claimed, and it is not the common
domestic Collared Dove (S. risoria).
For the moment we are anxious to discover what chances there are of its being an
escape, for I understand that several species of Streptopelia , including decaocto , have
been imported and offered for sale in at least four different years since the war, the
last time being in 1951. As it is just possible that this is the first British record of a
species we have been expecting on account of its recent rapid spread across Europe,
it is obviously particularly important that we attempt to discover all that we can
about this and related species in captivity.
Can you help me to find out who in recent years has possessed doves of any of the
decaocto- like species of Streptopelia (with the exception of risoria ) and if any have been
lost ? I will be particularly glad to hear from anyone in north Lincolnshire or south
Yorkshire who has kept or sold any of these eastern Turtle-doves since the war, and
I hope that they will be able to tell me whether or not individuals have escaped.

CAGE-BRED YELLOW-WINGED SUGAR-BIRDS

By Kenton C. Lint (San Diego Zoo, San Diego, California)
The Sugar-birds or Honey-creepers ( Cosrebida) are brilliantly
coloured little birds of the American tropics. They resemble Humming
Birds, with their long bills and the combination of bright greens,
blues, and reds. Their food includes the nectar of flowers, as well as
insects and soft fruits.
The Yellow-winged Sugar-bird (Cyanerpes cyaneus cyaneus ) has nested
on several occasions in captivity, but it is always news when they do
so successfully and rear their young to maturity. Mr. William Krebs,
in Pasadena, California, raised two nice babies in a large outdoor
aviary in 1942. Several other breeding successes have been recorded
in outdoor aviaries, many enjoying a semi-liberty captivity in which
the birds were allowed freedom to secure the necessary insects and
food to feed the babies.
In writing this article, we wish to record the breeding of Yellow-
winged Sugar-birds in a small cage, 24 inches long and 14 inches wide,
in an indoor bird room. The nest used by this breeding pair measured
4 inches by 4 inches, and was 3 inches high. Many different nesting
materials were tried before the birds decided what to use. Dried
grasses and the palm fibre from the African Hair Palm (Chamaerops
humilis) were finally used to build a rather flimsy nest in this little
plastic basket.
Yellow-winged Sugar-birds nest late in the year. The first egg was
laid 17th June, 1952. The second egg was laid the following day.
There has been some controversy concerning the colour of the Sugar-
bird eggs. The eggs were white, blotched with rusty red irregular
spots. The hen bird started sitting immediately after the second
egg was laid. In such a small cage, personal observation of many
details was easily made.
After twelve days of incubation, both eggs hatched on 30th June,
but the babies were not offered food the first day, as sufficient food

had been assimilated through the egg yolk for this period. The second
day, the hen left the nest for the first time to secure food for the babies.
Bread and milk sop, soaked raisins, hard-boiled egg yolk, fresh grapes,
ripe bananas, and orange supplemented by mealworms form our basic
diet for all of our Sugar-birds. The smallest mealworms were the
only food the mother bird would carry to her newly-hatched babies.
Both babies were smoke-black in colour and ate well from the first
time of feeding. The baby birds inserted their tiny bills inside the
bill of the mother bird and she pumped the partially digested meal-
worms into the tiny bills and throats of the baby birds. Both youngsters
grew rapidly, fed entirely on mealworms, for eleven days. When eleven
days old, I noticed the babies perching on the edge of the nest. When
sixteen days old, the babies drank water for the first time, and on the
seventeenth day both youngsters ate a little banana by themselves.
The male bird took no part in the incubation or in the feeding of the
young at any time. I was always worried lest the male bird might
throw the babies out of the nest, so I decided to remove him. The
cock bird was removed from the breeding cage when the babies were
fourteen days old.
Both babies were still olive-green in colour when twenty-four days
old. One was a little darker in colour, especially on the wings, which
probably indicated a male bird.
When forty-five days old, I decided to separate the young birds
from the mother. She was easily removed and returned to her mate,
but she showed a great deal of anxiety at being separated from her
babies.
The young birds are almost three months old to-day, and we are
satisfied that Yellow-winged Sugar-birds may be raised in small cages,
and mealworms are sufficient in the way of insect matter to rear them
properly in captivity.

FURTHER NOTES ON THE RUBY TYRANT IN

By Dr. J. Steinbacher (Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany)
Some considerable time has passed since I wrote in this magazine
on Pyrocephalus rubinus in freedom and captivity. My first article
closed with the establishment of the full moult in the summer of 1951,
after I had had the birds for six months. During this the male lost
his beautiful ruby red colour of the feathers and assumed a plain grey,
spotted plumage. But already new feathers were showing in various
parts of the body. This was in August. Four weeks later there was
yet another phase. The new red feathers on the back of the head

and throat had disappeared and instead light red spots appeared on
the breast and belly, which continuously increased in size, though
they did not at first become deeper. Both birds again lost many
small feathers and pecked and scratched themselves a great deal, as
is usual in the course of the moult.
Their behaviour, however, was quite different to that during the
summer moult in July-August. While then they were mostly sluggish
and sat motionless, they now were very active, particularly the male.
He often threatened the female with open beak and the typical beak
snapping, the hard, quick snapping together of the beak, pecked her
on the head and neck and drove her from her perch into a corner,
at which she uttered complaining calls and crouched down flat.
Frequently the male also flew playfully on to the back of the female,
whereat she crouched on the perch calling and crying. Also towards
humans the male proved to be the far more active of the two, quite
in contrast to the behaviour of the pair in the first months of captivity
which I have described (Avicultural Magazine, May-June, 1952).
It was considerably more fearless, in human parlance it could be said
that its self-consciousness now aroused had tremendously increased.
An explanation of these peculiar moulting conditions and the
change in behaviour may be that the change of breeding dress was
prematurely arrested as the natural food was lacking, so that the
plain dress of the female was assumed, but the sex hormones quickly
developed further after the moult. The new signs of development of
breeding dress then further indicate a final transposition of the rhythm
of the southern to that of the northern hemisphere, which the develop-
ment of the gonads greatly precipitates. The occasional attempts of
song and pairing of indigenous birds in autumn certainly show that
this is not especially new.
In October I transferred the Ruby Tyrants from the cage to a
spacious indoor aviary (125 X 75 X 125 cm.) with a simple wood
frame and wire netting. Their behaviour after that did not strikingly
alter. They hardly used the large space, kept to certain permanent
perching places on their branches, seldom went on the floor where
food was placed, and spent the night in separate places. Soon
afterwards new deep red feathers again appeared on the top of the
head and the light red parts on the breast extended further, but did
not become deeper in tone. In the middle of January, after having
survived the cold season, when the temperature was often only
6-8* G. in the bird room, without any harm or even any apparent
detriment to the well-being of the birds, in addition to the new ruby
red feathers in the region of the beak, deep red patches also appeared
on the sides of the belly, particularly under the wings. The growth
of these new feathers progressed rapidly without any distinguishable
loss of feathers. Actually the red feathers pushed between the existing

grey ones and largely covered them. In the process the male became
ever more aggressive, chased the female frequently, so that she flew
into a corner of the cage, pecked her, and attempted many times to
copulate. The female offered hardly any resistance to this and only
cried out when the attack came unexpectedly. During February
and March the red of the male became increasingly deeper, its extent
ever larger and the behaviour more resembled that of the species in
the free state. With sharp whip-like calls it flew round the aviary,
crest bristling, beak threateningly half open, or more often sharply
snapped shut. In April the male was practically as deep a red as in
the March of the previous year when I received it from the Argentine.
Its accentuated call dominated the room and now the female
answered, but often with somewhat complaining calls, obviously
inviting copulation. Both birds, particularly the female, searched for
plant fibres and other nesting material. I thereupon placed an old
Linnet's nest at a height of i m. in the aviary which the female
then often improved and hopped around.
In May repeated invitations to feed by the male were observed ; it
flew round with a mealworm in its beak, alighted on the back of the
female and gave her the worm. After that the female, with wings
placed high, and moved lightly up and down, and repeated calls
4 4 tjee--tjee--tjee " invited pairing. The male then came with
sharp 44 kiss kiss " calls but trod seldom, generally only stood lightly
on the back of the female and flew up again with snapping beak.
The female sat in and improved the nest, and the male, now also
occasionally showed some interest in it, so that I had great hopes
for eggs and a brood. Then, in addition to the dried ants eggs, I gave
a small portion of fresh ones, and these did not agree with my birds.
The male died on 25th May of acute inflammation of the intestines ;
all efforts to save it were in vain. Therefore my observations and
experiments were interrupted. I hope to be able to continue with
them with a new male and eventually also to achieve a brood which
was my ambition. But already a series of interesting data have been
obtained which were not entirely expected, above all with regard to
the change in colour. There is no knowledge of a change of breeding
dress in the male to a dull female plumage in the free state and, in
my opinion, this is not only due to the physiological effect of captivity,
but perhaps also to psychological reasons.

SOME NOTES ON GRASS PARRAKEETS

<bodyText confidence="0.996591" page_id="56291668"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
By the Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
Breeding Grass Parrakeets is rather like trying to obtain justice
in a Court of Law. With regard to the latter, if you have ioo per
cent right on your side and no political issues are involved, you
have a reasonable chance of getting some justice ; but you will
not get full justice nor will you even get what you do get without a
good deal of trouble and disappointment, not to mention expense !
In the same way if you provide them with everything that the human
mind can devise to promote their health and well-being, you have a
fair chance of breeding some Grass Parrakeets, but you will not breed
as many as you hoped to do, nor will you escape unexpected worries
and tragedies.
Last autumn, in preparation for the present season, I secured an
imported cock Elegant and a home-bred hen ; an imported cock
Turquoisine and a home-bred hen ; an imported pair of Bourkes,
and an imported pair of Splendids.
Although the cock Elegant arrived a bit late in the year for turning
out, I decided to risk him in the aviary and he and the hen passed
through the winter uneventfully. Elegants are among the hardier
and better-behaved of the Grass Parrakeets and one or two avi-
culturists, by combined good luck and good management, have
been able to maintain a healthy breeding stock for a respectable
number of years. In some cases they have also kept their birds
without artificial heat and this was the plan which I adopted, although,
in the end, I had cause to regret it. In April the hen went to nest
in a grandfather clock box in a sheltered part of the flight. A few
days after she had started to sit an exceptionally hot April day was
followed by an exceptionally cold and foggy night. As a result, I
found the cock, early next morning, very ill with inflammation of the
lungs, and he died an hour or two later. The hen carried on and
hatched and reared three good young ones, two cocks and a hen.
Lately I have obtained another imported cock for her.
At this point I may, perhaps, say that my Grass Parrakeet aviaries
are on fixed sites with tiled floors and are 20 feet in length. They
have cosy closed-in shelters with sanded floors.
The hen Turquoisine, a home-bred one, I had had with a cock
the previous summer. She nested twice, but of the two young birds
in the first round one died and one was killed by the cock as soon as
it left the nest. In order to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy, I
removed the cock when the second young bird was hatched, and the
hen reared it by herself successfully. I disposed of the youngster and
its murderous parent, and hoped to make another and more satis-
factory start with a new male. This, however, proved easier said

than done. Although they go to nest freely, Turquoisines are, next
to the exceedingly difficult Rock and Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeets,
the most difficult members of their family to deal with. Though they,
too, have been wintered out-of-doors, they get most of the ailments
which Parrakeet flesh is heir to, and they do not make good patients,
having no great amount of stamina to resist disease. If you give them
too much hemp, or if they feel bored with life, they readily take to
feather-plucking. They are also exceedingly temperamental. Married
couples are given to violent disputes, and many cocks are wife-beaters,
and even killers and, as already indicated, some will also destroy
their offspring. Well-behaved pairs certainly do exist, but there are
all-too-many which are not well-behaved ! Another trouble is that
the young birds are more apt to die in the nest than with almost
any other species of Parrakeet.
There is a further difficulty. The Australian authorities have,
I understand, recently tightened up the regulations dealing with the
export of native birds, so that if you obtain stock from law-abiding
individuals or institutions, they will probably to-day have come from
the aviaries of Australian aviculturists and will, more often than not,
have been discarded by the latter for some breeding vice or defect,
the exact nature of which you will in due course discover ! Australian
fanciers have a habit of keeping their birds in aviaries which are
much too small and this factor, also, does not encourage good health
or good manners in birds which have been long confined in them.
The new cock Turquoisine and his mate, like the pair of Elegants,
came through the winter successfully. They too, went to nest in
April and the cock, unlike some which I have mentioned, proved a
most gentle and devoted husband. Unfortunately, however, his
former owner still had an excellent reason for parting with him, the
reason being that he appears to possess an unexpected and unwelcome
enthusiasm for football ! As soon as his wife started to lay eggs he
spent most of his time in the nest-box pushing and kicking them
round the place, which did them no good, and entirely prevented
her from sitting peacefully on them. After he had ruined two clutches
in this way, I decided that desperate measures must be taken. When
the first egg of the third clutch appeared, I removed him to another
aviary occupied by a bachelor cock Bourke with whom, though very
restless, he lived in perfect amity, both gentlemen vindicating the
reputation of their respective species of being inoffensive towards
other birds.
The hen Turquoisine took her separation very badly and, for a long-
time, I fully expected she would not sit as, until her sixth egg had
been deposited, she was off the nest for the whole day on alternate
days. However, at the finish she did decide to incubate and hatched
two of her eggs. One chick died almost immediately, but the other

was reared and proved an exceptionally fine young cock showing a
trace of his red wing-bar even in nestling plumage. When he was
independent I hoped to put the pair together again and secure a
second brood, but the very day I meant to put the cock back with
his mate, he fell ill. His illness moreover, was a long one, and when
eventually he recovered the hen had dropped into moult and he
quickly followed her example.
To cope with the problem of temperamental cock Grass Parrakeets
one really needs an aviary with a partition and a shelter at each end,
so that, when need arises, one can shut off the cock, while still allowing
him to see his mate and, if he wishes, to feed her through the wire-
netting partition.
One very foolish mistake which people are apt to make with
Turquoisines if they should get a well-behaved and prolific pair, is to
over-breed from them and allow them to have as many as three nests
in succession. A policy which is detrimental to the health even of the
hardy Budgerigar is far too great a strain on the delicate constitution
of a Grass Parrakeet and in England, at any rate, if a pair of Turquoi-
sines are allowed to rear three broods in one season, they are most
unlikely to rear any in the next, probably because one or other of
them will have died before another spring comes round.
The two imported Bourke's were fine specimens and delightfully
tame and steady. They also possessed an appetite for green food
which is rather unusual in their species.
Bourke's are not really Grass Parrakeets at all, but are a species
wholly distinct and with no near relatives of any kind. They make
excellent foster parents for the Green Grass Parrakeets, but they seem
unable even to get as far as fertile eggs if they are mated with them.
They are desert birds, and may not even live on grass seed but on the
seeds of small plants other than grass which are found in dry areas.
Bourke's certainly can die and they equal, and possibly even exceed,
the green Grass Parrakeets in their capacity for cracking their skulls
against the wire-netting top of their cage or aviary flight, for which
reason a covering of branches or some other material is highly desirable,
to warn them to check the impetuous upward dash of their flight in
a sudden alarm.
Taking everything into consideration, however, they are a good
deal hardier than the true Grass Parrakeets and although the members
of the British stock now remaining are, from what I have seen of them,
often miserable runts, the species I am given to understand, is firmly
established in some Continental countries and also in America.
Although I have known them suffer from septic fever, they are, in the
main, much less susceptible to infectious disease both on the voyage
and in aviaries after their arrival and, when in good condition and
provided with a dry and cosy shelter, they certainly can be wintered

without heat. When of decent size and colour they are charming
little birds, with a soft beauty of colouring which matches their gentle
musical voices and the pretty whistling sound of their wings. The
couple which reached me last autumn at first certainly looked and
behaved, like a pair, both cock and hen showing the signs of being in
breeding condition normally indicative of the two sexes. After a week
or two, however, they both began to exhibit symptoms of eye disease.
Strange to say, however--and here again the difference from what
would have happened if they had been green Grass Parrakeets was
most striking--they did not appear to take the trouble very seriously.
They rubbed their eyes and closed them a bit, but it did not seem to
prevent their general health from being good nor even, amazing to
relate, their coming into breeding condition ! (At this time they
were being kept in a flight cage in the bird room.) As the weeks went
by, however, a mysterious change seemed to come over the " hen 55
Bourke. " She " and the cock in due course both recovered from the
eye disease but " she " also showed signs of recovering from being a
hen ! In fact, when spring came round the two birds were, to all
appearances, well-developed cocks and when I obtained a real hen and
put her in the aviary, the difference was most marked. The strange
phenomenon of change of sex has of course been observed in one or
two species of birds, but not, so far as I am aware, hitherto in the
parrot family.
The new hen, also an imported bird, I put with the cock who had
always been a cock and moved the other to an empty aviary.
The pair in due course went to nest and hatched and reared one
good young one. The hen then went to nest a second time, and
hatched four more, but when they were only ten days old the cock
started to misbehave himself and knock his wife about so badly that
she was unable to attend properly to the wants of her family, with the
result that two of them died. The remaining two, though still not
fully fledged, I took out of the nest-box and put with their mother
in a cage in the bird-room and there, notwithstanding the rough
treatment she had received, she reared them and reared them well.
It is very unusual for a cock Bourke to misbehave in this Turquosine-
like fashion. It may be that he had been getting too much hemp and
wanted to nest again prematurely. The giving of hemp is always a bit
of a problem. An unlimited amount is undoubtedly very good for
growing young birds, but it may get their fathers into too high condi-
tion and cause them to ill-treat their mates or their offspring.
The three young Bourkes which I have now put in the aviary with
the odd cock have done very well and it looks as though the particular
type of aviary in which I keep them suits the species. They are two
cocks and a hen. Even when the birds are fairly young the sexes are
not very difficult to distinguish, the hens being smaller and more

slender and having decidedly smaller heads. They also, when adult,
have no blue on the forehead but some cocks also lack the blue,
especially if they are aviary-bred and of degenerate stock.
The Splendid Grass Parrakeets had a rather unfortunate start as the
cock had been placed for a short time in a travelling cage with a spiteful
little Dwarf Parrot and arrived with a broken wing. In time his wing
mended sufficiently to enable him to fly but it always remained
dropped, spoiling his appearance. It was, however, the hen who
proved the first casualty. One day in the middle of winter, when she
had almost completed her moult and seemed quite fit, I found her
looking slightly ill and although at first it looked as if we had got her
into the hospital in good time she went down very rapidly and was dead
the next day. The post-mortem report was " coccidiosis ", but, as the
particular post-mortem examiner to whom I was sending specimens at
the time would have given coccidiosis as the cause of death of a bird
which had been shot or knocked on the head, I am doubtful of the
accuracy of the diagnosis as the symptoms were not those of that very
distinctive ailment.
I thought that my chance of breeding Splendids was ended for the
year but by good fortune I was able in the spring to obtain another
hen from Mr. Holmes Watkins who is having such remarkable success
with this species, a success which I trust he will long continue to enjoy.
When I introduced the new hen to her mate I hoped to see the court-
ship display of this, the most gorgeously beautiful of all parrakeets,
and wondered what it would be. The cock, however, though quite
interested in the new arrival, seemed to feel that he was quite beautiful
enough in his ordinary everyday deportment without any extra
demonstrations being necessary ; so beyond walking about at a distance
and saying " Chuk ! " from time to time, he did not do anything out of
the ordinary. They soon, however, became friendly and the hen,
who incidentally was less than twelve months old, took to a grandfather
clock nest in the flight. Two young birds were hatched and reared
leaving the nest just before I returned from Devonshire, the hen laying
a second time. When the young had been out for only four days the
cock became spiteful with them and I had to remove them hurriedly,
feeling, for the first time, that it was perhaps lucky that his wing had
been damaged or otherwise he might have caught and killed them
before I was able to intervene.
The second family of four hatched in due course out of the six eggs
laid. The cock was by now becoming very tame and used to wait
expectantly for me to bring him some tit-bit. I grew very fond of the
beautiful little fellow, a fact duly noted by X, the evil spirit who
removes the choicest members of one's collection of birds with a
regularity and ingenuity which mere chance cannot adequately
account for ! One morning, therefore, when I went to feed him, the

cock Splendid was not in his accustomed place. I looked inside the
shelter and on the floor of the shelter and again in the flight, to find
him in a corner of the flight. It needed only a second glance to see that
he was ill. He was indeed very ill and died within a couple of hours.
The post-mortem revealed, in addition to two long-standing ailments
which one would have thought would have prevented him from
breeding, evidences of a blow on the head, which, as he could not fly
very fast and the roof of the flight was well covered with branches, was
probably dealt him by X, exasperated that he had been unable to get
rid of him by other means ! His widow carried on with her task most
heroically and has successfully reared all four young ones which are
very fine specimens indeed, but, as she appeared one day with the
feathers knocked off the back of her head and the lower part of her
rump I gathered that X had had a swipe at her also ! With the claims
of a growing family to attend to she became even tamer than her mate
and is indeed the tamest and most intelligent Grass Parrakeet I have
ever had. She always greeted me with the disyllabic whistle of her
species which is so unexpectedly deep in tone for such a small bird.
Once, when I went to see how she was getting on and the supply of
green food was getting rather short, she flew down and nibbled
pointedly at a faded leaf of spinach-beet, looking up at me as she did so.
I promised to get her a fresh supply but, having other things to attend
to, I forgot all about it. Some time later I walked past the front of the
Splendid's aviary nearly thirty yards away, to be arrested by a pene-
trating whistle from the little lady inside, " What about that spinach-
beet you promised to get me ? " I apologized and went and fetched
some !
Recently, rather feeling that I was tempting Providence, as I prob-
ably am, I obtained three Rock Grass Parrakeets from a Continental
dealer. Rock Grass Parrakeets have seldom, if ever, been bred in
captivity and have a bad reputation for getting over-fat. So far, the
three new birds seem to be doing well and, being rather wild, take
plenty of exercise. I have arranged the two perches in the flight so that
they are as far apart as possible and, as I believe the species lives largely
on the seashore, I have provided a dish of special sea sand and seaweed
collected from below the tide-line in case the iodine should provide
something essential to their health. Rock Grass Parrakeets are perhaps
the most difficult of their family to sex and a single bird is always apt
to give one the impression of being a cock, possibly because, by
comparison with the more familiar Grass Parrakeets, the species is a
large one. If, however, both sexes can be seen together and studied at
one's leisure, genuine cocks can be distinguished by the rather greater
amount of blue on the face and the slightly heavier head.
Since writing the above, X has made two further onslaughts on the
unfortunate Splendids. Although various steps had been taken to

render such a catastrophe unlikely, I went out one morning to find

OBSERVATIONS ON BARBARY-DOVES KEPT AT

The Barbary-Dove {Streptopelia risoria ), the Ring-Dove of the lay-
man, and--most descriptively--Blonde Ringdove of the Americans,
has long been a favourite bird of mine. It has much to recommend it,
being hardy, beautiful, harmless to other birds (except related species),
and a free breeder. This last is, perhaps, a doubtful virtue, since it
is not always easy to find good homes for the surplus young.
Since 1946, and to some extent before the war, I have kept these
birds at semi-liberty. So kept they are incomparably more beautiful
and interesting than when confined, even in the largest aviary. Some
initial trouble may be involved in settling the birds, but it is well
worth taking for the extra pleasure and interest which will accrue.
This species has none of the homing " instinct " shown by the Pigeon
(Columba livid) or the Turtle-Dove (Streptopelia turtur ), and even after
years of liberty, may be hopelessly lost less than a quarter of a mile
from its home. I think this only happens when it is fleeing from a
pursuing hawk, or has been disturbed at night, and thus failed to notice
the way it has gone. For those desirous of keeping these birds at
semi-liberty, the following hints should prove useful, although, of
course, much will depend on the individual birds and local circum-

them up till morning. In time--at least in winter--roosting inside
will become second nature to them, and they will go in to roost like
fowls or pigeons. This is less important (and more difficult to achieve)
in summer, but when the trees are bare the Doves will almost certainly
be taken by Tawny Owls if allowed to roost outside.
(7) Do not shut up birds with others that persistently attack them.
This is the most important rule of all, its infringement is cruelty of
the worst kind, and one of which many are guilty. In practice this
means that except in autumn and winter only paired birds and their
still dependent young can be confined together.
The above rules are, of course, a counsel of perfection, and I would
not like to say how often I have neglected most of them. In this
matter, as in others, however, those who set a bad example are often
best qualified to give good advice.
At liberty the Barbary-Dove is a thing of grace and beauty. Its soft
buffish-fawn plumage--which bleaches to near-white with long
exposure to sun and rain--relieved by the black neck-ring and crimson
eye, contrasts pleasingly with vegetation. It has the same swift flight,
with 44 flicking " wing-beats as the common Turtle-Dove, and flies
freely. The display flight of the male is similar to that of most 4 4 turtle-
doves ". The bird flies upwards with loudly-clapping wings, then
glides down, often in a half circle, with wings and tail widely spread.
I shall never forget the thrill I felt when I saw a bird which had been
free only a few minutes perform this flight, which almost certainly
neither it nor its ancestors for many generations had previously been
able to do. Provided care is taken to see that all birds are getting
fed adequately there is no need to segregate breeding pairs when at
liberty. The vanquished can always flee from the victor, and the
quarrels and jealousies result in an amount of activity that would
surprise anyone who only knows this species as a cage-bird.
I have seen it stated that Barbary-Doves at liberty fall an easy
prey to natural enemies, and that they do not respond to the alarm
notes of other birds. This has certainly not been the case with mine.
The tameness which these birds display towards human beings in no
way affects their response to predators. Of course, birds that are in
imperfect health (which most birds bought from dealers are in my
experience) will have their escape reactions affected adversely thereby.
Similarly, recently released birds are handicapped by their ignorance
of the neighbourhood. These considerations--and the relative
vulnerability of fledgelings--apply equally, however, to any other
species, wild or domestic. My Barbary-Doves react to the alarm

notes or alarmed behaviour of passerine birds. Whether such responses
are due to " learning " or innate recognition of the " frightened "
tone discernible in all alarm notes, I am unable to say. Each year
I lose one or two adults, and sometimes several young. But it is
astonishing how even young ones which--owing to my being too busy
to supervise them--have been allowed to wander forth into a world
in which predators, both furred and feathered, are common objects,
yet manage, more often than not, to survive. With pairs that actually
nest outside it is otherwise. Sometimes one or two pairs of my Doves
will nest away, usually at a distance from the garden. This only
happens because I have not taken the precaution of shutting them
up when they have reared one brood and are looking for a new nest-
site. In such cases the behaviour of the pair makes it obvious when
they are sitting and when feeding young. But in all these cases the
young have never appeared and the parents' behaviour shows that
they have been lost when from two to three weeks old. I do not
know what creature is responsible, but cats, Jays, Grows, Magpies,
Tawny Owls, and Sparrow-Hawks are all common locally, and all
potential fledgling-eaters.
The escape reactions of the Barbary-Dove when confronted with a
hawk (in all cases of fairly close approach which I have seen the
Sparrow-Hawk (Accipiter nisus) has been the species involved) are of
interest and worth describing in some detail. When a hawk is seen
high above, or at some distance, the Dove usually remains still and
watches it. Usually it shows its fear by sleeking down its plumage,
making itself " long and thin " and giving its alarm note. The close
(and usually sudden) approach of a hunting Sparrow-Hawk elicits
one of two reactions. Most commonly the Dove flies forwards and
upwards with a noisy clatter of wings and a speed and acceleration
reminiscent of a flushed Partridge. At other times it will " freeze "
on its perch in a crouching posture with feathers sleeked down and
head stretched forward. If it takes wing the Dove may fly straight
into a tree and remain there until it has got over its fright, or else
fly forward very fast, gaining height as it goes, for several hundred
yards, then turn and fly in high, wide, circles, coming lower as its
fears diminish, and finally alighting, still nervous and " on edge ",
on the highest point of some building. Taking cover, or flying high
and circling, seems to depend primarily on whether or not there is a
suitable tree in front of the Dove when it begins its headlong dash
for safety. It is amazing that a bird travelling at such speed can enter
a tree without doing itself serious injury. No doubt it skilfully avoids
the larger branches, but at times, to judge from the sound, it crashes
through the smaller twigs with considerable force.
I am not sure what determines whether the Dove will freeze or
take wing. Crouching in birds--when used in reference to enemies--

is, of course, the preparation or " intention-movement 55 of leaping
up to run or fly. When the bird freezes in a crouching posture (which
is a regular and marked behaviour pattern in many species) the
reason--psychologically--is almost certainly because some other
impulse is in conflict with and inhibiting the impulse to flee. Wild
Turtle-Doves (Streptopelia turtur) usually freeze in the same manner as
that described above if approached by man when they are incubating.
Here it is obviously parental feeling and the brooding urge which
conflict with and--up to a point--inhibit freezing. One might
expect that in the Barbary-Dove crouching and freezing would be a
response to a lesser degree of fear than that which elicits fleeing.
This does not seem to be the case. On four occasions I have seen a
Barbary-Dove (three different individuals) " freeze " in this manner
when a hawk suddenly appeared very close. I had the impression
that the Dove was literally " paralysed with fear " at the nearness
of its enemy. In each case the hawk--which was actually hunting
for food at the time--flew straight on over the Dove, passing within
a yard or two of it, and apparently failing to notice it. It seems
probable that a Sparrow-Hawk in its low, fast, hunting flight, relies
chiefly on their movements for spotting potential victims. If this is so,
it is doubtless likewise with other accipitrine hawks and thus natural
selection might well have favoured survival of those Doves which,
when surprised at very close quarters by one of these hawks, froze in
terror instead of making a vain effort to escape. It is worth mentioning
that I have never seen a Barbary crouch and freeze when surprised
on the ground, but I have not seen one so surprised at such close
quarters as those mentioned above.
The proverbial tameness of the Barbary-Dove towards human beings
is shown equally by young that are allowed their liberty from the first
as by caged birds. If approached slowly fledglings will allow them-
selves to be picked up by hand, and although most adults will not
permit this, they come readily to the hand for food and so can easily
be caught when necessary. Occasionally birds that are much more
wild and nervous than normal--although tame by comparison with
other species of pigeons--may crop up. One such bird was not
only nervous and "jumpy" and very reluctant to feed from the
hand, but it had an exceptionally neat head, small delicate bill, and
trim shape, thus suggesting a correlation between physical appearance
and mental qualities. But this analogy must not be pressed too far*
as in the domestic Pigeon birds approaching the wild type are not--
other conditions being equal--more timid than most of the coarse
monstrosities favoured by the pigeon fancier.
The notes and much of the sexual behaviour of the Barbary has
been dealt with by many authors, notably Craig and Whitman, whose
works all those interested in pigeons are advised to read. Nevertheless,

it will not be out of place briefly to describe some aspects of it and
to deal more fully with observations that are not, so far as I know,
duplicated in their works. The coo of the Barbary-Dove, the well-
known " Kuk-k'rrooo " or, closer at hand " Kuk k'rrooo-wa ! 55 is
to me one of the most beautiful of all bird sounds. The coo of the
female is less loud than the (full) coo of the male, and more broken
and almost " trilling 55 in the middle. The tone and emphasis, as
well as the loudness of the coo, varies according to its context, but the
differences are not very marked, and cannot well be described in words.
The bird coos when bowing in display, when calling-to-nest, as a
greeting to its mate when the latter arrives to take its turn on the
nest, as a contact call when the mate is out of sight, to signify its
readiness to feed fledged young, when it hears a noise at night, and as
an equivalent to the song of male passerine birds. The situations
listed above, except for the first two and the last, may not always elicit
cooing.
The cooing at night is particularly interesting, since it seems such
a potentially lethal habit. It is shared, of course, as is well known,
by the domestic pigeon, but as tame Stock-Doves do the same thing,
it is unlikely that it is a habit that has arisen--though it may have
hypertrophied--under domestication. The night cooing is, or seems
to be, a response to some disturbance sufficient to awaken or attract
the attention of the roosting Dove, but not sufficient to frighten it
(? or to frighten it seriously). As we have seen, the coo is always a
note of self-assertion, and may sometimes have a threatening signifi-
cance. It seems possible then that the Dove coos in response to some
mildly alarming stimulus, much as a man might whistle or talk to
himself in homologous circumstances. Probably the carrying out
of the self-assertive act of cooing has a " reassuring " effect on the
bird performing it. Thus the " ignorant " natives in some parts of
the world who--so I am told--say that when the Barbary-Dove in its
cage coos at night, it does so to frighten away evil spirits, are, in a
sense, right in their psychological implications if not in their material
interpretation thereof. Female Barbaries do not normally use the
bowing display--even when homosexually paired--but an unpaired
female, not in male company will often become very " masculine "
in behaviour, and display to any strange bird placed with her. Cooing,
and to a lesser extent the laughing cry, appear to be linked with the
reproductive cycle, and birds that are sexually inactive are relatively--
but not entirely--silent.
Both sexes utter the laughing cry (a mirthless, jeering laugh) that
is so characteristic of the species. Craig's statement that this cry
corresponds to the human word " Hello " and can have as many
different meanings is most apt and true. It is fundamentally, I think,
a note of aggression, and the Dove always utters it in a posture (head

which is essentially one of attack, although it has become incorporated
in the sexual behaviour of paired birds. The Barbary-Dove uses this
cry when it approaches another bird with aggressive or sexual

perch in its territory or (especially) when it alights at or near its nest.

alights " is, I feel sure, based on observations of caged birds which
had of necessity to be " alighting near the nest " every time they
changed their position. The laughing cry is used by both members
of a pair immediately after copulation. The male bird, when hopping
towards another bird (if it is a stranger or his own mate, not if it is a
known rival) in the aggressive posture and giving the laughing cry,
will often change into display and at the moment of transition the
laughing cry merges into a coo, the intermediate sounds being almost
comically curious.
I do not find my Barbaries breed throughout the year, as they are
said to do when caged. In early January there is a resumption of
frequent cooing, its intensity being dependent rather on the amount
of sunlight than the temperature. Sometimes a pair will lay in that
month, but more often it is late February or March before the first
eggs are laid. Breeding then continues till August or September.
By mid-September the adults are in full moult and breeding has
usually ceased, although there are often young still in the nest. Once
a pair laid eggs in late September and reared the resultant young
successfully. Barbaries usually lay again, in a new nest, when the
young are from three to five weeks old, sometimes even earlier. The
female ceases to feed the young when, or soon after, she again begins
to incubate. She tolerates and seems rather to invite than repel their
company until the eggs hatch. The moment an egg of the second
nest hatches she ceases to tolerate the young of the first brood, and

attacks them fiercely if they are in the vicinity of the nest. The male
continues to feed the young of the first brood whilst incubating the
eggs of the second, or at any rate for some time after incubation
commences, but he usually ceases to feed them before the second
brood hatch. After this happens he never feeds the older young, and
gradually ceases to tolerate them, but he does not show the same
sudden change from friendly tolerance to violent hatred as does the hen.
In order to effect some compromise between my desire to let my
Doves fulfil their natural impulses and my desire to have the minimum
number of young produced, I allow each pair to rear only two, or at
most three broods per year. This I achieve by boiling the eggs of at
least every other clutch. I have read that if Doves are not allowed
to feed young after sitting the soft food " sours in their crops 55 and
makes them ill. This, I am sure, is a fallacy. I have had many
different pairs sitting on boiled eggs, and have never known one
show signs of illness. Whether in the absence of feeding the soft food
is shed off I do not know, but close watching of Doves feeding very
callow young has convinced me that some of the soft food brought
up into the gullet is normally re-swallowed by the parent. Doubtless
it then passes from the crop to the stomach in the normal manner
and does not, in some strange way, remain in the crop and go sour.
Paired Barbary-Doves show great affection for each other, and
should they be accidentally or deliberately separated for some time
their excitement on being reunited is touching. When at liberty
their quarrels with their neighbours doubtless strengthen the bond
between them. Very rarely a pair that are nesting will suddenly, and
inexplicably, start to fight each other in the vicinity of their nest.
Even on the two occasions when I witnessed the commencements of
such fights I was unable to determine what "started them off".
Once such a fight is on each bird seems to regard the other as an
intruding stranger. Since both are on their own territory, indeed at
the very heart of it, each fights with the utmost determination, and
the more opposition it receives the more its " self-righteous " fury
increases. Since morally both birds are " in the right " this is one of
the few instances where the issue of a fight between two birds of the
same species depends on sheer physical strength. Hence the female
is always worsted in the end, although she fights with reckless courage,
flying back to the nest site and renewing the combat no matter how
many times she is beaten to the ground. Fearing that she might be
killed, I have always taken away the female at this stage, when she
has been to all appearances on the point of complete collapse. It has
been some hours before she has appeared recovered and on the pair
being reunited they have greeted each other "as if there had never
been a cross word between them ". These rare fights between paired
birds appear to take place because for some reason the partners

suddenly react to each other as they would to the sight of a strange
Dove at their nest-site. How or why this occurs I have no idea, but
it may (or may not) be significant that I have never seen such a fight
between pairs of females, whereas two males paired together--who
were normally devoted to each other--had at least four such fights
during the two years that they were paired.
That two female Barbary-Doves will often pair together is well
known. Such pairings never take place if an eligible male is at hand,
but once paired personal affection, or habituation, will keep the two
females together, even if an active male is trying to entice one away.
Such females, although regularly performing the mating ceremony
with each other, nevertheless often adopt the coition-inviting posture
if a male displays to them. Hence, if they are allowed to mix with
other birds, such pairs are not denied the joys and trials of parenthood.
But the owner should remove two of the four eggs laid.
It must be emphasized, since the contrary has often been inferred,
that Doves that form homosexual pairs are in no sense " abnormal ",
nor do they when so paired show behaviour normally confined to the
opposite sex. The most they do is to show behaviour patterns that
are common to both sexes , but that one sex usually indulges in to a much
greater degree, rather more than they would if homosexually paired.
For example, " calling to nest ", taking the active role in copulation,
and seeking and bringing home nesting-material are all actions
normally performed chiefly by the male, but by the female--even in
heterosexual pairs--to some extent. When two females are paired,
it is obvious that each will be presented with the stimuli to perform
such actions more often than would normally be the case. On the
other hand, displaying to the mate (bowing and cooing) is a behaviour
pattern confined to the male in normal pairs (although the isolated
unpaired female may become " masculine " and display), and effective
nest-building movements are confined to the female. Neither of these
two behaviour patterns are--in my experience--shown by the opposite
sex as a result of homosexual pairing. The female paired to another
female never displays to it. The male paired to another male does
not build a nest, although if the nest-site is a box or basket from
which the material he and his partner bring cannot easily fall an
apology for a nest may accrue from the birds sitting on the material
brought.
Pair-formation between two male Doves is of very rare occurrence.
It has been said to occur through one bird cowing the other to such
an extent that the latter shows female behaviour. This I very much
doubt. Certainly if after a fight one male was so exhausted that it
crouched on the floor the other might, in all probability, attempt to
copulate with it. The situation releasing copulation--or attempts
thereat--is the very simple one of a Dove remaining motionless in

a crouched or flattened posture. Even a heterosexually paired female
will usually attempt to copulate if presented with a dove-skin stuffed
in such a posture. I have seen only one pair of male Doves, and one
of male Pigeons (Columba livid ), but I took some care in observing
their behaviour, and in neither case was there anything to suggest
that one of the partners was " cowed 55 by the other, and they both
continued to show characteristically masculine behaviour.
The behaviour of the two male Barbaries is worth giving in some
detail, since in other accounts of such pairings the birds usually
appear to have been captive, whereas these were for the most part
allowed their liberty in the company of others of their kind. They
were two nest-mates, bred in early spring from a pair which I had
given to a friend. The parents were lost and these two young were
kept together in a small outhouse till October, and then given back
to me. I placed them in a roomy shed along with three other birds
of the same year (which subsequently proved to be all females) and
two old females that were paired to each other. The birds were kept
confined during the week and released all day on Saturday and
Sunday, the only days I was home at evening early enough to get
them in for the night. I was busy at the time, and paid them little
attention. The sex of the birds soon became evident (apart from
behaviour, when related birds are compared, the cocks are paler in
colour, longer in shape, and heavier in the head than the hens), but
it was not until March that it suddenly struck me that although I had
for over a month seen two Doves " nesting " on a suitable ledge, no
eggs had been laid and no proper nest built. Suspicion once aroused
was soon confirmed, the two males were paired together--having no
doubt formed a deep affection for each other when they had been
isolated from all other Doves in their youth--and the others had
sorted themselves out into two pairs of hens, and an odd hen who
was making frantic attempts to get herself paired to one or both of
the two males.
Observations on this male pair gave interesting suggestions as to
the most important factors binding normal pairs, and confirmed my
previous opinion that the mutual fondling and nest-calling on the
nest-site plays a more important role in maintaining the pair-bond
than does the mating ceremony. These two males seldom mated
with each other, and they very rarely displayed to each other. They
would, however, often perform both these behaviour patterns as a
result of the excitement of seeing each other again if they had (arti-
ficially) been kept apart for some hours.
They constantly and persistently chased female Doves (appearing
well able to distinguish their sex, but perhaps this was due to individual
recognition), displaying to them, and attempting to copulate with
them. They never indulged in pre-copulatory billing with a female

(as they did when they mated with each other), even when, as often
happened, an unpaired hen bird eagerly tried to initiate it with one
or other of them. They never showed the slightest sexual jealousy
towards one another. It was an extraordinary sight to see them
displaying simultaneously to the same female, one on either side.
Even more spectacular was their display flight, as they would fly up
together, side by side, and perform " in time 55 with each other.
Except for their four fights previously mentioned, which were
exactly the same as those sometimes indulged in by normal pairs and of
whose meaning I am completely ignorant, the two brothers always gave
the impression of being " two minds with but a single thought, two
hearts that beat as one ". Since the " single thought 55 commonly
centred around beating-up a neighbour or trying to inflict on his
wife a fate popularly supposed to be worse than death, their partner-
ship was probably less amusing to their fellows than to the human
spectator. These two males hatched and reared many young ones,
their owner acting as a " good fairy " and supplying them, after they
had been " nesting 55 for some time, with a nest of sorts complete with
eggs. Under such conditions the sight of the eggs naturally induced
them to start incubation at once. They found no difficulty in dividing
the daylight hours on duty between them, but were at first reluctant
to sit at night. This was understandable, since the male normally,
in addition to not sitting at night, roosts well away from the nest as
soon as the female starts to sit. On the other hand, Doves respond
to the sight of their eggs lying uncovered, in some cases even to the
sight of the partner who should be on duty away from the nest, by
going to the nest and commencing to incubate, even " out of turn ".
These two males were thus nightly torn between conflicting impulses.
Neither " wanted 55 to incubate all night and whichever was sitting
in late evening would leave the nest at the " least excuse ". If, for
example, the other brother alighted near the nest-site, the sitter
would consider himself as relieved, and hurriedly quit the nest. This
often resulted in the eggs being left all night, but if I caught one of the
errant birds, showed it the exposed eggs and then placed it on the
nest-edge it would usually cover them. But in every instance the birds
seemed to " learn " after the first few days of incubation--or the
brooding-drive became stronger--and the eggs were not thereafter
left even at dusk. It was not always the same bird which remained
on the nest at night.
After this state of affairs had continued for some two years I decided
that the following spring I would separate the brothers and see if
they would then pair normally if offered suitable mates. I had little
doubt they would prove quite normal, although I was a little curious.
In spite of their constant pursuit of females and forcible attempts to
mount them, on one occasion when I had seen a female eagerly

soliciting one of them, he had merely walked round and round her,
continually making the intention-movements of mounting, but
seeming " unable " to do so. But I was not able to put the matter
to the proof. I neglected to get the brothers in one autumn evening,
and I never saw them again. I expect they were killed by a Tawny
Owl, but shall never know for sure.
My Barbary-Doves seem to have little idea of foraging for them-
selves. They pick about the garden and sometimes on the near
roadsides, but they do not go off into the fields as do domestic Pigeons.
They eat the seeds of various weeds, and in late summer, although
ready enough to take their usual rations, they are sometimes birds
missing at mealtimes, and those that come often have crops half-full.
Over one of their favourite resting-trees--a crab apple--black bryony
grows in profusion, and the Doves feed readily on the dull red berries.
Inexperienced birds often fill their crops with the berries of the
mountain ash, but this makes them violently sick, the bird looks ill
and vomits up the contents of both crop and stomach, and will never
touch a rowanberry thereafter. On one occasion, thinking it would
do no harm, I spent half an hour breaking up shelled acorns and
handing the pieces to seven of my Doves who eagerly swallowed them.
As a result all were very ill for days, three of them dying on the second
and third days, and the rest recovering. It is strange that a food eaten
with impunity by so many wild birds--although in captivity Jays are
the only birds I know that will eat acorns eagerly--should have had
this effect, but there can be little doubt the acorns were responsible
as three Doves which had not eaten them remained perfectly fit.
The attacking posture of the Barbary-Dove, when the bird jumps
forward with lowered head, uttering its laughing cry, has already
been mentioned. This form of attack is probably always in some
degree linked with sexual or territorial feeling (it is also shown with
essentially the same movement pattern towards the mate). The
attacking bird does not show fear, and it attacks with the bill. When
Doves fight, that is to say when the attacker meets with opposition,
the wings are the chief weapons used, the birds cuffing hard at each
other, and each trying to get on to the other's back to strike down at it.
When thus engaged they show to some degree the second form of
threat posture. In this the bird puffs out all its feathers, raises the far
wing, may spread its tail on the side towards the enemy, and strikes
out with the near wing. This form of threat, the effect of which is to
make the Dove look as large and terrifying as possible, is common to
other Doves and Pigeons, and is shown by disturbed nestlings from
an early age, usually before they are half-fledged. The young draw
in loud puffing breaths and also make a snapping sound that is
correlated with a movement of the mandibles and generally supposed
to be made by their clicking together. No such snapping sound is

heard in the adults (although the adult male Stock-dove (Columba
oenas) uses this bill-clicking in its display), but they draw the loud
panting breaths and often give the alarm note--which in all Doves
I know of is a very similar little gasping moan--very intensely. At
low intensity, as with all other displays, the postures and movements
are much less marked.
The above behaviour is shown when the bird seems to be torn
between fear and anger, or, to speak ethologically, when its escape
drive and aggressive drive are simultaneously activated. The intensity
of the display is directly correlated with the degree of fear the bird
is feeling. Hence it is usually seen in more extreme forms when the
Dove is opposed to some other species than when intra-specific quarrels
are concerned. I have seen a male Barbary and a female Turtle-Dove
(1 Streptopelia turtur ) (at different times) in very intense " fear-threat "
display when attacking a tame Magpie that alighted a few yards from
the nest on which its mate was brooding. It is very commonly
adopted by brooding Doves when a human being closely approaches
the nest, although in full version it is shown less often by the Barbary
than by wild species of Doves (in captivity) or rather timid domestic
Pigeons. The tamer Barbary-Dove, although it often attacks the hand,
does not usually go into very full " fear-threat " display when it does so.
Although we thus see that the bird appears to be impelled both by
fear and aggressiveness, yet it is possible that the anger, and resultant
aggressiveness, may perhaps have secondarily arisen because the bird
was torn by conflicting impulses. In other words the brooding Dove
may not stay on its nest and threaten and fight because it was, in the
first place, impelled by aggressiveness as well as fear, but the aggressive
feeling may have arisen because the bird was impelled at once by two
conflicting impulses.
That conflicting impulses, which are of course at the same time
always thwarted, or at any rate partially thwarted impulses, can in
birds, as in man, arouse aggressive feeling is easily demonstrated with
the Barbary-Dove. One has a Dove which is fairly tame, but still
not quite tame enough to feed from the hand, and one tries to tame it
by throwing it a few tit-bits, and then when it has eaten those lying
near the hand one proffers it a peanut or other titbit in one's fingers.
The bird--which a moment before was impelled solely by the feeding
drive--will " bristle-up " into fear-threat display as it comes up to
the hand, and will usually actually strike out with its wing as it takes
the nut from the fingers. Sometimes indeed its courage will just suffice
for it to come right up to the hand, but then fail, and it will strike out
and hit the hand offering the food, but retire without taking the
nut. Here one has evidently made the bird feel and act aggressively
because one has forced it into a situation where it was impelled by
the conflicting claims of fear and hunger.

From the foregoing it will be seen that the fear-threat display has
something in common with crouching and freezing, in that both occur
when the escape drive is inhibited. Psychologically, the different
behaviour patterns may depend on whether or not aggressive feeling
as well as other impulses are evoked by the situation. Biologically the
behaviour, like most if not all behaviour patterns, would seem to have
survival value. Except in reference to man, threat display and attack
or defence of nest seems only to be shown to such creatures as the
Dove might possibly defeat, or at least intimidate, and not towards
those against which it could have no chance.
Alternative behaviour-patterns are shown by incubating Doves
(taken as species, not as individuals) toward man. Birds of a com-
parable degree of tameness (or wildness) may either go into fear-threat
display or else crouch and freeze on the nest. In my experience the
same bird never shows both forms of behaviour on different occasions.
If one puts one's hand under the bird in fear-threat display, it attacks
it in a furious " hysterical " manner. If one puts one's hand under the
" freezing " bird it makes no movement to defend the nest. Wilder
birds flee the nest when approached--but after having initially
either " frozen " or gone into threat display--and perfectly tame
birds sit calm and unafraid, sometimes fighting the intruding hand,
but showing no trace of fear when so doing. Naturally every inter-
gradation between the three degrees of tameness may be shown.
The above remarks apply to Turtle-Doves and Palm-Doves (Streptopelia
senegalensis) as well as to Barbaries. Indeed, I must admit that
Barbaries do not show the four behaviour patterns linked with the
three stages of tameness very well, since they are very seldom wild
enough to leave the nest when touched. Wild Turtle-Doves and Palm-
Doves always--in my limited experience-- " freeze " on the nest
when approached, and never go into threat display, although a male
Palm-Dove that had been in captivity only a few weeks did so.
If one puts one's hand over a brooding or incubating Barbary-Dove
and grasps it lightly round the body, it may respond by sudden con-
vulsive movements of both wings and legs. The wings are moved
quickly, one would say they are beaten but for the fact that they are
not unfolded and do not move more than an inch or so out from the
body. The legs at the same time stamp up and down quickly and
forcibly, so as to produce a rapid, almost rattling, sound as they
strike the nest. This behaviour is shown by some birds more than
others (by some not at all) and mostly when the eggs are chipping
or the young still callow. The convulsive movements suggest fear,
but they are given by perfectly tame birds that are used to being
handled on the nest and will always accept food from the hand, even
immediately after having given these movements. I think, however,
that these movements may be a low-intensity form of some " injury-

feigning " behaviour which I have not seen. It is noteworthy that
although this behaviour seems relatively rare, or ill-developed, in
Doves, it has been recorded in a fairly intense form in the Indian
Ring-Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) which is a very close relative of the
domestic bird.
I find my Barbaries when at liberty perch with equal freedom on
trees and buildings, with perhaps a greater tendency to rest on the
former. They do not tend to choose large or high trees, but commonly
perch from 8 to 20 feet from the ground. Even when perching on
buildings they tend rather to alight or rest on one-storey buildings than
on high roofs. For song-posts male birds choose exposed branches,
roof-ridges, and especially the tops of telephone poles, but here again
a fairly open situation rather than height seems to be the main
criterion. Unpaired males naturally " sing 55 and wander more than
paired ones. An adult male who was unpaired throughout the
spring and summer 1952, spent so much time cooing in sun or rain
that his plumage bleached several shades paler than that of his fellows.
His two furthest song posts were a quarter of a mile apart.
At times a Barbary-Dove will vanish, and after it has been " missing,
believed killed " for weeks or even months, will reappear none the
worse. Whether the bird has got its own living or fed at someone's
bird table in the interim I have never been able to find out.
Even more remarkable was the case of an old hen Barbary. In her
tenth year she was sitting on a nest in a rose pergola. Coming down
the garden one July morning, I saw the nest and broken eggs on the
ground, which was bestrewn with Dove feathers. I assumed that
an owl or hawk had killed the female on the nest. The following
December, I received a post-card saying that my " pigeon " had
been caught in his garden by a man living some six miles away.
I fetched the bird, which proved to be the old female Dove, in quite
good condition. It seems likely that she had been getting her own
living, as being ringed and very tame it is unlikely that she would
have been fed by people without being caught by them. Anyone
catching her would surely either have informed me, or else removed
the " name and address " ring from her leg. The bird is still alive
and well, in her twelfth year. This, however, is no great age for a
Barbary, and I believe birds of over 30 years old have been recorded
in the Avicultural Magazine.
P.S .--The line-sketches in this paper are intended only to give
an idea of the various postures described. They are not intended to
be feather for feather drawings, and--as will I fear be painfully
obvious--no attempt has been made at detailed exactitude.

KELP GEESE AND FLIGHTLESS STEAMER
DUCK FROM THE FALKLAND ISLANDS
FOR THE SEVERN WILDFOWL TRUST

By William J. L. Sladen (Oxford, England)
Falkland or Greater Kelp Goose (Chloephaga hybrida malvinarum)
A pair of juveniles were brought into Stanley from Fox Bay, West
Falklands, on 20th June, 1951. Details of their rearing by Mr. Perry,
of Fox Bay, were obtained by post later. " Two very young goslings
taken from a nest were reared on bread and milk. They were then
run with the ducks and hens and picked up food there." I was also
told that they would eat grass well. They were full winged and tame.
As soon as they arrived in Stanley their wings were clipped. On
22nd June they were transferred to the Falkland Islands Dependencies
Survey Vessel "John Biscoe ".
Travelling Box. --The size recommended by Mr. Peter Scott for one-
bird crates was 32 inches long, 24 inches wide, and 26 inches high. The
birds were kept together in a larger crate as they were used to each
others company. The sloping slats were 2 inches wide with 3-inch
openings between, otherwise the design was the same as recommended
in the Severn Wildfowl Trust Third Annual Report (1949-1950).
Four feeding tins were tied to the slats with string. One each for fresh
water, sea water, bread soaked in fresh water, and (after St. Vincents)
bananas in fresh water. A sack curtain was draped over the front of
the crate.
Cleanliness. --The birds stood on wire netting. A tray below the
netting was an unnecessary refinement as the crate was hosed at least
once a day. Careful attention was paid to thorough cleaning of wood
work around the feeding tins. If this was not done once a day, mould
would collect where bread was slobbered over the woodwork when
feeding. When passing through the tropics it sometimes reached the
sporing stage within 24 hours. Any food not consumed was thrown
away daily when the crate was washed. The birds were usually sprayed
gently with salt water and at no time during the voyage did they fail
to preen themselves. In cool wet weather they were not sprayed.
Draughts. --When passing through the tropics the crate was put in
a place of maximum draught, but in the more temperate zones,
draughty places were avoided.
Food in the Wild State. --The usual food of the Kelp Goose is " luche ",
a flat green ribbon-like seaweed, Porphyra umbilicalis, which they pick
up along the seashore. In autumn, birds are often seen wandering
inland and Falkland Islanders have told me that they will feed on
Diddle-dee fruit ( Empetrum rubrum) and even grass. Two birds

(JB212/1-2) dissected on 22nd May, 1949, at Fox Bay had crops full
of Malvina berries (Myrteola nummularia) and occasional leaves. One
male (JB201/1) dissected 22nd April, 1949, had a crop full of stringy
seaweed and occasional minute shells and Crustacea intermingled. It
is impossible to say whether the animal matter was purposely eaten or
taken in unintentionally with the weed.
Food for the Journey .--Blaauw (1913) succeeded in transporting a
captive Lesser Kelp Goose (C. hybrida hybrida) back to Holland by
feeding it on dried luche which was soaked in water immediately
before use. Alastair Morrison (1947) succeeded in bringing back a large
number of the same sub-species. Through inadequate drying, most
of his luche went bad, so the diet for the rest of the voyage had to be
soaked biscuit supplemented by a little lettuce and luche. I had hoped
to collect a supply of the seaweed but had no time before the ship
sailed. The plan had been to dry it thoroughly and store it in 7-lb.
tins with soldered press-lids to keep airtight for the tropics until
required.
Dehydrated cabbage might be worth a trial. They liked it fresh, but
would not touch it when cooked. It should therefore be tried soaked
in cold water first.
Bread soaked in fresh water was always available. The two of them
together never consumed more than one full tin a day (1 to ij lb.).
At Montevideo 100 lettuces were purchased. These were very
small, 6 to 7 constituting an average English lettuce. A fresh supply
of 40 lettuces, supplemented by some surplus leaves from the galley
had to keep them going from St. Vincents, Cape Verde Islands to
Rotterdam. The St. Vincents lettuces were even smaller. From
Montevideo to Rotterdam they had an average of five lettuces a day.
At Rotterdam full-sized lettuces were bought and they easily trebled
their previous consumption before arriving in Southampton.
Old shirts and cigarettes were bartered for bananas over the side of
the ship at St. Vincents and from here to England the birds ate four
a day. The fruit was chopped into small pieces and dropped into a tin
quarter-full of fresh water. It stuck to their bills and mouths, but they
enjoyed it nevertheless and found it much easier to swallow if mixed
with water.
Other food taken included chopped up raw cabbage, pineapple, and
crushed tinned peas. Of all the food tried, lettuce was the most
appreciated and was taken from the hand.
Travelling .--The geese kept in good condition throughout the voyage.
They were very thin to start with but we thought they gained a little
weight. They were charmingly tame, thanks to the Perrys of Fox Bay.
We brought back a cargo of seal oil which was off-loaded at Rotter-
dam. Here, on 24th July, they were thoroughly soaked during a day
of continual rain. They were restless and noisy all that evening, so

I took them down to my cabin where they had full run of the floor and
were soon preening themselves and happy. One of the male's wings
started drooping during the last 48 hours and showed no signs of
improvement when we arrived at Southampton on 26th July ; it
however made a good recovery at the Severn Wildfowl Trust.

these birds should not be difficult to catch, but they present problems
of their own. They roost at night above high water but are readily
disturbed and, though they show little shyness, always keep at a safe
distance. They are strong birds with powerful bills.
The following methods are known.
Daylight. --(1) Chasing them in calm water in a motor-boat. They
can travel at some speed on the surface and almost, but not quite,
become airborne. When the boat catches up they dive and alter course.
If the boat is manoeuvrable enough, it can zig-zag after them until
they get so short of breath that they can dive no more. It is then
possible to pick them out of the water.
(2) Driving them on to the land by several rowing boats converging
on a narrow creek. Once on land, they are said to be helpless and
easily caught.
At night. --(3) Driving them very carefully up a creek on to land by
boat party, a wading party converging on them from the flanks with
powerful torches and catching them by hand when on shore. This
method was used in June, 1949, when we caught a pair. One of these
(a female) reached the Severn Wildfowl Trust by "John Biscoe ". It
is not a very satisfactory method as the ducks are apt to panic and dive
back under the boat and waders in shallow water.
(4) Driving them over a fishing net spread across a narrow creek,
then dragging the net in behind the birds until it can be raised out of
the water and dropped on top of them. This method was used in
June, 1951.
With a bit of experience this method could prove very effective. We
caught three at the first attempt, but had more in the net to start with.
The small party swam quite unsuspectingly over the cork floats. On
the second attempt nothing would induce the birds to swim over the
net again in the same creek. We tried another creek and drove them
successfully over the net but could not pull it in towards the shore
because it became tangled among the boulders and debris. This
method is therefore dependent on a muddy or sandy creek. It would
be better to have a fishing net without cork floats, but these are not
always easy to come by.

A and B lie flat at each end of the net.
D rows a light dinghy, or better, a flat-
p&amp;gt; oa i- bottomed pram. C is " runner ", and directed
r &amp;apos;--A L a A by D ; his job is to throw stones outside the
#^abandoned ducks to keep them going in the desired
in excitement direction. Carefully-thrown stones can do as
effective work as a second boat.
I think these, and even Kelp Geese could be caught without much
difficulty by one person, or at the most two, by choosing a dark stormy
night with a strong wind blowing in from the water, and dazzling the
birds with a powerful torch. I found this method very effective for
catching Sheathbills (Chionis alba) at Signy Island, South Orkneys,
for ringing. This is a small white intelligent bird, but quite helpless in
absolute darkness when dazzled by a strong light. The roar of the
waves drowns all sounds of approach. One of the secrets of success is
to advance rapidly with the torch focussed on the bird all the time.
Travelling Boxes and Cleanliness .--One male and two females caught
three days before the ship sailed were kept for most of the voyage in
separate boxes of the size recommended for the Kelp Geese. The
same attention to cleanliness was observed.
Food .--Each box had four feeding tins. One each for salt and fresh
water, bread soaked in water and pollard mixed with bread and maize.
Throughout the voyage they showed a preference for bread soaked in
fresh water, rarely touching the pollard and maize unless hungry.
Banana, lettuce, and cabbage were ignored. The male would eat
cooked fish when mixed with bread, though he hardly ever touched
raw chopped flying-fish that landed on board overnight. They drank
from the fresh water tin and would sometimes attempt to bathe by
ducking their heads into it and throwing the water back, but never
seemed to do more than dabble their bills in the salt water. This
preference for fresh water is of interest and is discussed later. They

started feeding between 7 and 10 days after capture. Each bird would
eat an average of 1 to lb. of soaked bread daily.
Travelling. --The male settled down better than the two females, but
they were always restless and trying to get out when the sack curtain
was up. One of the females was so determined in her efforts that she
succeeded in loosening a slat and escaped. She was last seen swimming
in the direction of land approximately 105 miles off the Brazilian coast
south of Rio de Janeiro. If an obscure species of duck is described by
Brazilian ornithologists, it may prove to be our " Logger duck"
which was given a good send-off towards the coast by " Biscoe's "
wash.
The soaking that the birds had at Rotterdam probably accelerated
the lung condition of the remaining female. On arrival at Southamp-
ton she looked very ill and did not survive the car journey to Slim-
bridge. Post-mortem and microscopic examination revealed extensive
lesions of mycotic disease of the air sacs. Culture of these grew a pure
growth of Aspergillus fumigatus.

Ten samples of mould from slobbered bread, maize, and other
foodstuffs given to the birds were taken by sterile swab and cultured
on Sabouraud's media. Nine different moulds were isolated but no
Aspergillus fumigatus. Nor were any considered pathogenic ; yet the
female Steamer duck died of Aspergillosis on arrival in spite of pre-
cautions. Perhaps infected foodstuffs are not such an important factor
as lowered resistance. A susceptible bird in poor condition might pick
up the Aspergillus fumigatus spores from the atmosphere and succumb
to the disease whatever precautions were taken. It would however be
unwise to jump to any conclusions without a more thorough investiga-
tion than could be carried out on this occasion. No prophylactic
potassium iodide was given (Yealland 1949).
Fresh versus Salt Water
A definite preference for fresh water was noted in both the Kelp
Geese and Steamer Ducks. The position of the water tins was changed
every day, yet they always chose the fresh and did little but dabble
their bills in the salt. It is possible that they took in a small amount
of salt water on these occasions, but it was insignificant compared with
the fresh. They also preferred bread soaked in fresh water. In the
wild state these species are almost entirely maritime. Close field study
may throw some light on this unexpected preference. It is possible
that these, and other maritime ducks, spend much of their time in
creeks into which fresh water is running. The change from the marine
life of the wild state to fresh water life of captivity may not be quite such
a physiological upheaval as might at first be suspected. However, even

salt when they feed from the shore. This lack may have to be com-

FIRST BREEDING OF THE MANYCOLOUR
PARRAKEET IN THE U.S.A.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
Although it was possible to import psittacine birds into the U.S.A.
during the iggo's, apparently only a very few Manycolours were ever
imported. Probably many aviculturists failed to make the effort, due
to the bad reputation Manycolours had gained for being delicate and
difficult to keep in good condition in captivity.
In the U.S. the only living Manycolour for many years was in the
collection of the late I. D. Putnam in San Diego. This hen reared
hybrid young with a male Stanley while in the Putnam collection.
The young bird from this union was a female, and I remember it as
a rather splotchy and washed out reddish coloured bird about inter-
mediate in size between the two parents.
If I am not mistaken, Mr. Putnam had secured a pair of Many-
colours about 1938. At the time he said that there were only about
two pairs imported, and that he could secure only one of the two
pairs. His pair eventually nested and had fertile eggs, but unfortu-
nately the male died during incubation and the hen deserted the eggs,
thus ending his experience with the species. He once told me it was
the greatest avicultural disappointment he ever experienced.
In 1950 we were fortunate enough to secure from a zoo two imported
pairs and an extra hen of this species. These birds arrived in the
U.S. during July of 1950, and were released from their quarantine
period in late 1950. By October the Korean war effort had resulted
in the mobilization of many Reservists, and in October I was stationed
in San Francisco some 450 miles from Los Angeles. On my first free
week-end I drove down to Los Angeles to see these new, long-hoped-for
additions. They really were in fine condition, and I was extremely
pleased with them.
In 1951 the only "success" was with the odd hen bird which laid and
incubated five eggs. She was later mated to a male Red Rump, who
suddenly turned on her and literally ripped her to pieces. Although
both mated pairs were seen to mate they never appeared too serious
in their intentions, and no results were obtained in 1951.
In 1952, one pair nested very early in February. I think they had
visited the nest box almost constantly for some fifty days before this
hen actually began to lay. Naturally I was very excited about this
chance to breed P. multicolor for the first time in America.
At this point our narrative takes a dismal turn, and we have only
a failure to contemplate. After about two weeks of incubation I was
awakened one night to hear the birds all calling and flying about in
a night fright, caused by a cat on the aviaries. I turned on the lights

in the yard and soon all the birds had quietened down, but unfortun-
ately the female Manycolour had left the nest and would not return.
Finally, in desperation I took her six eggs (of which five were fertile) &amp;gt;
and they were driven over to a friend's house and placed under Shell
Parrakeets. With an extremely heavy heart I finally turned in about
four in the morning--wondering why I ever grew out of the Pigeon-
raising stage in avicultural development.
Subsequently all five young hatched, but unfortunately they all died
in a few days, despite the fact they were hand-fed. So, to date, the
closest to a successful breeding in the U.S. were five dead chicks--
and a very frustrated aviculturist. Several weeks following these
unhappy and discouraging events " Lady Luck " began to shine. Both
pairs of Manycolours got busy and started to get their nests ready for
families. The rather odd thing was that both pairs actually started
to nest on the same day--10th March. Here the similarity ended for
the first pair (that had the abortive first nest) were models of perfection
with the hen sitting very close and the male attentive. The second
pair were quite casual about the entire affair and this hen spent more
time sitting in her doorway than on her eggs. I never really had any
faith in this second pair, for the hen was very nervous and would
leave her nest every time she heard a noise. Later we shall see that she
surprised me.
Another great difference was in the pre-nesting habits of the two
pairs. The first pair spent several weeks getting their nest ready
while the second pair spent only a few hours. Already mentioned
was the difference between the two hens as regards their nests--and
sticking close to their eggs. Both pairs hatched simultaneously and
proved to be very good parents. They ate great amounts of bread and
green seeding grasses. After about the seventh day the females spent
considerable time away from their nests during the day. In both cases
the males fed both their hens and also entered the nests and fed the
young directly. Both males were seen to enter the nests the second
day following the hatching of the young--presumably to feed.
Food mixtures included a standard mixture of seed composed of one
part millet, one part oat groats, two parts canary, and all the sun-
flower they would use. To this was added one-quarter apple and
one-quarter orange daily, plus a liberal amount of soaked (water)
bread and green seeding grasses. The nest-boxes in both cases were
hung under a shelter, but about six inches from the edge of the shelter.
Both the boxes were of a size commonly used for Grass (, Neophema)
Parrakeets and Agapornis in the U.S. Wood shavings were used
to fill the boxes. When the boxes were cleaned and readied for the
breeding season we used this method : (1) filled the box half full of
woodshavings, and (2) poured water on them. (3) Following this we
added dry shavings, filling the box up to the nesting entrance. This

allows the moisture gradually to seep up to the eggs, and has always
worked very satisfactorily. The important thing to remember in
doing this is that it is done about forty-five days in advance of the
hanging of the box. Naturally if you did this just a day or so in
advance of the hanging of the box, you might have a nest much too
cold and damp.
The aviary sizes were different in these two nestings. One pair were
in a cage 16 feet long, while the other pair were in a cage 12 feet long.
Both pens were three feet wide with good shelters, and were in the sun
for a period every day. During the time the birds were nesting,
Southern California had some very unusual rains, including one
storm that dropped some seven inches of rain in one day. Even so, the
Manycolours managed to look chipper throughout the storm.
The pair that took their procreational activities so lightly deserted
their youngsters about the fourteenth day. I believe that the trouble
was that the male had mated to the hen again and subsequently
they left their three babies. Oddly, they made no attempt to nest
again--and dropped into a moult.
The first pair proceeded right along with their family, and consumed
great quantities of feed. They ate very large amounts of bread, and
little wonder when we saw the final result--six youngsters ! It is odd,
but we could never hear the young being fed--they certainly were
very quiet babies.
The Manycoloured is rather widely distributed over Central
Australia and Southern Queensland to Victoria, and also Western
Australia. In Australia it apparently is a rather common bird, both
in the wild state and also in the bird shops, etc. I have seen some
references to the fact that at certain times of the year they are for sale
for as little as 5^. in Australia.
The six youngsters all looked very nice, and were relatively quiet
and steady. They were easily sexed the day they left the nest, for the
four young males were paler editions of the father, and the two young
hens closely resembled their dusky mother. Some of the young
males were brighter than others.
The six youngsters and their parents really do make a very nice
showing. We will mate the youngsters up and probably split up the
other adult pair that seemed to be so nervous.
Though their tails were rather short upon leaving the nest, they
grew very rapidly, and in about three weeks their tails were as long
as the parents. The young are wonderfully steady and quiet, and
appear to be even more tame than their parents.
Just why one finds so many printed references to their supposedly
being delicate, I do not know. I rather imagine that they are very
delicate when first trapped, and are hardy when once acclimatized.
I have seen printed statements to this effect.

A fine Monkey-eating Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) has been sent as
a present from Mr. Alex Lawrance who caught it in the Philippine
Islands. It is hoped that this bird is a male, for the female pre-
sented by Mr. Whitley in 1939 laid an egg a few years ago and she
seemed pleased to see another of her own kind. Other presentations
include a Virginian Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) ; a Red-billed
Pintail ( Anas erythrorhyncha) and a Black Kite ( Milvus migrans ).
A Blue-winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) ; five East African Bare-
throated Francolins ( Pternistis leucoscepus infuscatus) ; an Olive Sun-
bird (Cyanomitra olivacea), new to the collection; and a Cape Dove
((Ena capensis) were received in exchange. A Rufous-necked Weaver
has been bred at the Bird House.
The King Penguin chick is now twelve weeks old and weighs
25 pounds. The father died from pneumonia a month ago ; he
was otherwise in perfect condition and weighed 36 lb. 10 oz., so there
was no evidence that he suffered as a result of his onerous task.
The father of the first Edinburgh chick reared in 1919, monopolized
the egg and chick as this one did, and he also died, evidently from
malnutrition, for he weighed only 25 pounds.
Three pairs of Black-footed Penguins are now nesting.

E. H. N. Lowther. Illustrated, with 151 photographs by the
authors, and 5 coloured plates by Mrs. D. V. Cowen. Oxford
University Press, 1952. 38^. net.
This book deals with that part of Kashmir which lies to the south
of the Karakarom range, and is on the border between the Palaearctic
and Indian Zoological regions. Though most of the birds belong to
the former region, and some are very similar to European species,
there are a few purely Indian which extend into the area up the valley
of the Jhelum River. Most of the birds are residents, but many, too,
are summer visitors, which after the breeding season descend to the
foothills of the Himalayas and the plains of India. Quite a number
of the species are the same as those found about the hill stations in
the Western Himalayas, such as the Black Bulbul, White-cheeked
Bulbul, Redstarts, and Rock Thrushes as well as several of Doves
and the Chukar; of the last-named bird Colonel Define Radcliffe
had a delightfully tame example from Kashmir, which followed him
in the streets of Bombay, and when he was at home he took it to
Switzerland, much to the amusement of people taking part in winter
sports.
Both the authors are well known photographers of Indian birds,
and have paid many visits to Kashmir for the purpose of studying the
birds and taking pictures of both them and their nests. Their notes
on habits are full of interest, and add considerably to our knowledge
of the birds of that part of the world. These observations do not always
agree with statements in the standard work on Indian birds, but
here we have first-hand observations, and not what an author has
written from the notes of others.
The photographs are of a high standard, and the coloured plates
should be helpful in identifying species.

I do not propose giving a detailed description of this Parrot, as there is a coloured
plate by Roland Green of the bird then living at Regent's Park, and an account by
F. Shaw Mayer of the species in its natural habitat, New Guinea, in the Avicultural
Magazine, July, 1936.
There is a mounted specimen in the Bird Gallery, Natural History Museum, and
a specimen can be seen in the natural history collection of the Birmingham City
Museum.
My present bird was collected by Shaw Mayer and brought home with his collec-
tion by Frost in July this year. It is fed on bananas, apples, plums, grapes ; it also
likes some carrots and boiled potato occasionally. Each morning with its fruit
it has some " Sunnybix " and sponge roll, over which some condensed milk is
poured. Owing to the nature of the food its excreta is rather copious, necessitating
frequent cleaning of the cage and perches, even more often than with a Lory.
The bird is sprayed with a flower spray, as are all the psittacines in the Parrot House
at Whipsnade, and occasionally I give it a wipe with a damp cloth.
The voice is really most remarkable. The Duke of Bedford wrote of a bird in his
collection : " Her voice was awful and suggested a mixture of a rattle, a klaxon
horn, and the yell of a Banksian Cockatoo," a pretty fair description.

POLYNEURITIS, CONJUNCTIVITIS AND COCCIDIOSIS IN BIRDS

Those who imported Australian Parrakeets in the days before the ban may recall
that on occasion some of them--Kings, Crimson-winged, Barraband's, and Black-
tailed--arrived in apparently good health but for being paralysed in the legs.
Broadtails and others were not affected in this way. Some adult Harlequin Ducks
caught in Iceland during the Spring of 1951, all developed paralysis of the legs
within a few weeks of being brought back, but Long-tailed and Barrow's Golden-eye
whose summer diet must be much the same, remained unaffected.
The Harlequin Ducks readily responded to treatment with dried yeast in the food,
making complete recoveries, and it would appear that the paralysed Parrakeets
were also suffering from a vitamin B deficiency. It is strange that some--not par-
ticularly specialized feeders--should be so sensitive to a vitamin B deficiency while
others are not.
An analogous case is that of the contagious conjunctivitis to which the Grass

under which this disease might be expected to develop, remain almost if not quite
immune.
It is, by the way, an excellent thing that at last this disease is to be investigated on
really scientific lines, for conjunctival inflammation from whatever cause presents
such similar symptoms that diagnosis from appearances alone must sometimes be
erroneous.
For the same reason one wonders whether there is such widespread coccidiosis
among parrakeets. No pathologist would be rash enough to diagnose this disease
by appearances alone and without a careful examination of the feces, so diagnosis
by those with no pathological knowledge must be largely in the nature of guesswork.
Coccidiosis is a disease associated with the intensive rearing and keeping of ground
or water birds, for its spread is due to contamination of food and water by infected
feces and so the chance of an outbreak among parrakeets kept in pairs in clean
aviaries must be small.
Blount (Diseases of Poultry, p. 443) says : " In general, the different species of
coccidia are strictly host specific, and the coccidia of the chicken are uninfective to
other poultry." Which of the many species of coccidia is so pathogenic to parrakeets ?

Replying to the correspondence evoked by my " Psittacorial Notes ", first with
regard to coccidiosis. I am sorry that the Duke of Bedford understood me to suggest
that Sulphamezathine was worse than useless for this scourge, on the contrary,
it has been most successful in many instances, and my concluding remarks on the
subject were to the effect that, whenever coccidiosis was suspected I reverted to the
immediate use of the drug. I emphasized that correct diagnosis was essential, but
that the expense and waste of time of microscopical examination in the laboratory
was worse than useless if, as I had been informed, it was possible, if unlikely, to
obtain a negative result during a certain stage of the development of the disease.
As regards eye disease, Dr. Lake's offer of assistance was most welcome and con-
structive, and I know that some have already taken advantage of it and further
experiments are now being carried out by the doctor. The following note may
clarify my suggestion that careless handling was a contributory cause in these cases.
In a shipment of birds which travelled for eight weeks the losses were very high and
many of the survivors suffered from eye disease, although all were supposed to be in
perfect health when dispatched. Again in a consignment sent by air there were
several losses and many specimens were badly infected on arrival, which ended
fatally in many cases, although all were reputed to be in perfect health when
dispatched only eight days previously. This I find hard to believe, and my suggestion
was that through rough handling--parrakeets are invariably grabbed self-defensively
behind the neck without ceremony--when being changed from cage to cage the eyes
frequently become covered with grit and dirt which must be very painful to the bird.
In trying to effect some relief the victim rubs its eye along the perch which is generally
fouled whilst travelling. Under such conditions, if only one bird had a touch of con-
junctivitis, it is going to spread rapidly and aggravate any unhealthy condition in
its incipient stage. Observation of any affected bird will quickly make my meaning
clear, its persistent and vigorous rubbing of both eyes along the perch is very apparent.
I can recall suffering one summer from a very infectious form of conjunctivitis, and
although the doctors were probably right in telling me, as a small boy, that there was
nothing in my eye, and on no account was I to rub it, I was never convinced that
they knew what they were talking about, and in view of the very contagious nature
of this epidemic I can well imagine that if we had all used the same handkerchiefs
or towels to ease the pain in our eyes, just as the birds use the same perch whilst
travelling, the results would have been equally disastrous and broadcast.

The Honorary Secretary in his records of Parrots and Parrot-like birds bred in
captivity, gives 1948 as the last recorded date for the breeding of the Australian King
in England. Very few have been successful, but a pair imported in 1951 reared two
exceptionally fine young here this season with no fuss or bother whatever. Then
unfortunately one day in the early autumn, the adult hen seemed not quite right.
She responded well to heat and sulphamezanthine, but suddenly fell away, and a
post mortem examination revealed intestinal catarrh as the cause of death.
Splendids have proved ridiculously easy to breed, two hens rearing seventeen
young in the season. The former tendency for both young and adult to crack their
skulls against the roof netting appears to have been bred out of the modern bird.
Both hens carried green leaf when sitting, one completely carpeting the bed of her nest.
As the Duke of Bedford once pointed out, there are certainly two forms of eye
disease. A young Hooded cock imported during the summer arrived with the acute
form--considerable swelling of the lids accompanied by a watery discharge from
the eye itself. It responded successfully, though considerably more slowly, to the
treatment used by me with imported Splendids last season which had, what the
Duke has described as, the chronic form of the disease.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send
a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly in-
dependent of their parents. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids,
or of local races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

EXPERIENCE DURING FIFTEEN YEARS WITH
THE FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF
HUMMING BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975845" page_id="56291750"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
By Axel Reventlow (Managing Director of the Zoological Gardens,
Copenhagen, Denmark)
Since we got our first Humming Birds in May, 1935, these small
birds have been one of our greatest attractions. Many people have
come to our Zoo specially to see the Humming Birds, and on busy
days one or two keepers constantly have to regulate the stream and to
make the crowd move on. This interest has not diminished since the
arrival of the first birds, and in this connection I should like to mention
that a gentleman from England, who had never before seen live
Humming Birds, was so enthusiastic about the birds that he at once
cancelled his air passage in order to study them for a whole day.
In our bird-house at present we have a stock of about 700 birds of
more than 300 different species, but the Humming Birds still prove
the principal attraction. On the 1st August, 1952, we had 40
Humming Birds of eight or nine different kinds.
It is very important that the Humming Birds should be in good
condition on arrival. According to my experience, the last con-
signments to Europe of these birds have not, by far, been of the
same good quality or consisting of as many different species as before
the war. Then the birds were brought to Europe by clever and
experienced men such as Charles Cordier and the German, Danisch,
who generally caught the birds themselves and had time and patience
enough to care for and feed them, and to clean the cages properly
during the journey from Brazil, a voyage of about 10-12 days by the
great passenger liners. The Humming Birds are now coming to
Europe by air, and though this means a quicker journey, it involves
the great drawback that the crew of the aeroplanes only in very few
cases shows the least interest in the welfare of the birds. During the
last few years we have several times got collections of Humming Birds

consisting of big and very small ones all mixed together, and conse-
quently the small ones were constantly chased away from the feeding-
glasses so that many of them starved to death during the journey.
The cages were badly constructed and almost impossible to keep
clean. On arrival at our airport late in the evening many of the
birds were lying on the bottom of the cage, in a very deplorable state.
They were so soiled that they stuck together in their own faeces, and in
the food spilled from the feeding-glasses. My wife and I had to wash
every single bird several times with cotton-wool in lukewarm water,
dry them by means of a heating lamp, and feed them by hand almost
the whole night.
Immediately after the arrival of a collection of Humming Birds it
is advisable to put them into as many small cages as possible, so that
every bird can rest, and drink as much as it needs from the bottles.
It is very important to use a great number of feeding-glasses and to
place them in the cages a good distance apart. Usually I divide
the birds up into at least three different lots according to their size.
Every lot is then divided into smaller lots according to their condition.
The best specimens are placed together and can, as a rule, get along
very well when provided with sufficient light, heat, and food. The
next lot, which is weaker, must generally be fed by hand, and the last,
including quite exhausted birds and some without wing-feathers which
are consequently unable to fly up on the perches, need to be constantly
fed by hand. The birds should be taken by the beak and held between
the thumb and the third finger of the right hand ; the forefinger
should be placed on the back of the bird so that its wings are sticking
out between the fingers and can be moved when the beak of the bird
is put into the spout of a feeding-bottle which is held in the left hand.
The beak should not be put too far into the liquid and care must be
taken not to spill any of the liquid on the feathers.
It is quite astonishing to observe the vitality of these small creatures,
in many cases weighing only i J to 4 grams. Very often I have seen
them lying stiff and motionless with closed eyes and expanded wings
on the bottom of the travelling boxes, but putting them into my breast
or trouser pockets I soon found them beginning to stir the wings and,
shortly after having been fed by hand, they sat on the perches or were
flying around in the cage as if nothing had happened to them. After
the arrival of new birds we generally do not put out the electric light
at night for about a week so that they are able to find the feeding-
glasses and to drink whenever they like.
At present our Humming Birds are placed in five cages or aviaries,
two of them being 145 cm. long, 135 cm. deep, and 180 cm. high. The
medium-sized cages are 325 cm. long, 235 cm. deep, and 290 cm. high
--and the biggest one is 1,250 cm. long, 500 cm. deep, and 400 cm.
high. The Humming Birds are generally put together according to

their size, so that the smallest species are preferably placed in the
smallest cages. It is, however, remarkable to note that a number of
Mosquito Humming Birds, White-bellied Humming Birds, and
Swallow-tailed Humming Birds, the whole summer have got along
splendidly in the biggest cage together with Sunbirds, Sugarbirds,
Tanagers, and other gaily coloured birds. At the end of this summer,
when the Humming Birds from the biggest of the above-mentioned
cages had to be removed, the plumage and general condition of these
birds were remarkably better in comparison with those from the
smaller cages.
All cages are furnished with live plants and flowers. The biggest
one, containing also a number of alligators and a little pond is, by
means of palms, dracenaes, sansiviera, and other plants, arranged
as an artificial tropic scene. The most suitable plants for the small
cages are stone-ferns as for instance Nephrolepis whitmanni, Begonia,
Erica, Solanum capistratum, Cobaea , and Monster a deliciosa , the long soft
aerial roots which are excellent as resting places for the Humming
Birds. The bottom of the cages is covered with brick-coloured gravel,
moss, and grass. The moss and grass have to be renewed rather often
lest they should decay in the humid atmosphere and thus foul the air
in the cages. All plants are sprayed every day with lukewarm water
which is used by the birds for drinking and bathing purposes.
It is wonderful to see the small energetic birds sitting on the green
leaves and rubbing the water into their feathers. As the Humming
Birds have never been seen sitting on the bottom of the cages, we have
fixed some artificial leaves made of green rubber to the plants. These
artificial leaves are somewhat the shape of dishes, so they serve both
as drinking vessels and bath tubs. The keeper enters the cages several
times daily in order to clean the leaves and to give fresh food. If we
want to catch any particular Humming Bird we spray it with a syringe
until it is soaked with water and falls to the bottom of the cage, when
it is easily caught.
It is very important that the temperature of the cages is as constant
as possible ; it may, however, be a little lower at night. I consider
a temperature of 22-24* centigrade as best during the day, and 18-20*
centigrade at night. By accident the temperature has sometimes
fallen to 13-14* centigrade at night, but the birds have never come to
any harm.
The cages have to be supplied with plenty of fresh air. The
Humming Birds do not feel comfortable if the air is constantly too
moist or too foul, owing to decaying plants or moss. Preferably less
heat and more fresh air !
Our Humming Birds cages are heated by electricity, and we use
a varying number of stoves according to the outside temperature
and the sun : for example, if the sun is shining many hours on the

glass roof of the bird-house, we naturally put out some of the electric
stoves. We also have to take into consideration the heat from the
lamps alight in the cages. The neon tubes are placed in such a way
that the birds are illuminated from above, below, and from the sides.
It would be an advantage if the cages could be placed in a rather
low place so as to be convenient to the human eye. Having been
forced to use some existing cages, we have not yet been able to solve
the problem of illumination to our entire satisfaction, but this question
will be taken up soon. We have never noticed that the Humming
Birds, or their eyes, got damaged by the heat of the lamps or the
strong light. They are able to look directly towards the sun without
being dazzled. In the very few cases when a Humming Bird has flown
against the glass front of the cage, it was being chased by other
male birds.
As everybody knows, the Humming Birds are by nature very
quarrelsome and unsociable among themselves. I have, for instance,
never seen two of them sitting close together as many other small
birds often do. Owing to their bright colours we prefer to keep
male birds, so it is inevitable that some quarrelling takes place and
some of them drive others away from certain feeding bottles which
they consider to be their own property. It is well known that
Humming Birds in a wild state are birds which energetically and
constantly keep others away from their special territory. Every day
at certain times they are to be found on the same perches, generally
on a bare twig and in an open place. For this reason, we have put a
considerable number of bare branches and twigs into our cages, and
these are constantly being used by the birds. New Humming Birds
always require a certain space of time before choosing their special
sleeping places, but after this they can be found every night at the
same place. The newcomers are usually chased by the old ones ;
these are generally stronger than the others and are usually flying
better. We therefore temporarily remove the most pugnacious of the
old birds until the new ones become acquainted with the cages and the
feeding-bottles.
During the dark season we constantly have the artificial light burning
In the cages of the Humming Birds. In the evening most of the lamps
are put out and only a few below the ceiling remain burning for a short
time, and these are then gradually put out in the course of 10-15
minutes by means of a special dimming switch made for this purpose.
Before total darkness sets in, we count the birds through the outer
pane of glass. If any of them still prove to be restless, we must wait
and put out the last light, when all are sitting quietly at their sleeping
places. Usually the Humming Birds fall asleep very quickly, and
when healthy they sit in a very characteristic attitude with the wings
pressed very close to the body which is practically resting on the

twig, with the beak pointing upwards in an angle of about 45 0 . When
sick or exhausted a Humming Bird will put its beak more or less
vertically in the air during the sleep, i.e. that means considerably
more than 45 0 . The more sick it is, the more it raises the beak.
The birds have a very tight grip on the twigs, and are almost
impossible to shake off. Having had the opportunity to study the
Humming Birds for many years, I have not yet seen any of them
" putting their heads under their wings " as many other birds do
when sleeping.
During sleep the body-temperature of these birds, which is normally
about 42 0 centigrade, drops considerably. Their consumption of
oxygen is very reduced in this condition which can practically be
called a state of torpor. I beg to refer to an article by Dr. F. W.
Braestrup in the Danish Salmonsen's Cyclopaedia, where he quotes
an article by Oliver P. Pearson in " The Condor ", vol. 52, page 145,
1950 : "By Hummers the amount of oxygen varies throughout the
twenty-four hours. The Humming Bird spends the night in a
lethargic slumber during which the metabolism descends to about
of the normal one. Some birds could not exist at all without
becoming torpid every night. The very small kinds of Humming
Birds have a metabolism of such a rapidity that they could not take
sufficient reserves of nourishment to survive a night without eating,
if the expenditure of energy at night were normal. This is a conse-
quence of their very modest size."
The Humming Birds have a fantastic energy and endurance which
is illustrated by the following. In Birds of America , page 183, ii,
T. Gilbert Pearson writes among other things : " These Humming
Birds winter to a limited number in South Florida. The bulk of them,
however, go farther south. In the autumn nights the little birds
launch out across the Gulf of Mexico straight for Yucatan or Central
America. This incredible journey, not less than 500 miles (937J km.)
is made without a single stop for food or rest."
The Humming Birds are in their own way very intelligent and
independent animals. So they are very often in a surprising way able
to get along in an unforeseen situation. Their sense of direction is
fantastic, and they very soon get accustomed to new surroundings
and new conditions. They do not show any fear of the keeper going
into their cages every day to feed them and to clean the glass. Their
senses are developed to an astonishing degree : the sight, hearing,
and as / think also, to some extent, the sense of smell, are excellent.
In order to be sure that all the birds get sufficient to eat, we always
place a great number of feeding-glasses in our cages. Some of them
are hidden behind the big green leaves, and these glasses are of special
importance to the weaker birds and the newcomers, which are very
often chased by the other ones. Each glass is suspended by a specially

constructed holder and contains about 40 grams of liquid. According
to our experience every Humming Bird drinks on an average between
17 and 15 cm 3 of liquid in the course of twelve hours. Taking into
consideration the weight of the birds j(i J-4-5 grams), this seems quite
fantastic.
The glasses are furnished with a soft rubber cork and both this and
the glass must be kept spotlessly clean. The birds are fed twice a day.
The Morning Food (at 8 o'clock) for forty birds consists of 1 litre of
water, 4 table-spoonfuls of honey (about 125 g.), 3 table-spoonfuls of
condensed milk with sugar (about 40 g.), 1 table-spoonful of Mellin's
Food (about iog.), and a pinch of meat extract with salt (about 3 g.).
To this quantity is added 5 small drops of A and D Vitamins. Each
drop contains 750 units of A and 125 units of D vitamins. The
vitamins should be stirred very carefully in the condensed milk and
a little hot water ; the rest of the water (about 750 g.) should be
lukewarm.
At about 4.30 in the afternoon (on hot days a little earlier), the
morning food is replaced by the Night Food , which does not become
sour even if remaining 12 hours or longer in the cages. The night
food consists of 1 litre of lukewarm water, 5 table-spoonfuls of honey
(about 160 g.) stirred and mixed up with the contents of 1 ampoule
10 mg. of vitamin B (chlorhydrate of thiamine), and 1 ampoule of
100 mg. vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
The recipe of this vitamin food has been given by Mr. Charles
Cordier in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 58, No. 4, page 143,
July-August, 1952, in an article entitled " A Better Way to feed
Humming Birds In the Copenhagen Zoo we have, however,
with what I should call fairly good results, been using for many
years what Cordier in his article calls " an antiquated formula "
which contains less honey but some sugar and 2 tablespoonfuls
of Mellin's Food. We have now started gradually to reduce the
quantity of Mellin's Food and to increase the quantity of honey.
There are, however, two things Mr. Cordier does not mention in his
article : fresh water and the provision of live insects. As most
Humming Birds in a wild state eat quite a lot of small live insects, etc.,
I attach great importance to this kind of food. In 1934 I brought
along with me about 25 live fruit-flies (.Drosophila repleta ) from the
Zoological Garden in Berlin and having later established a special
fly-farm we have now reared millions of these small insects. We
catch them in a net and release them alive to the birds which catch
them in the air and eat them.
All our Humming Bird cages are of course made in a way to prevent
the small flies from escaping.
During the years in which we have kept Humming Birds we have
several times had to deal with severe invasions of red ants ( Mono -

morium pharaonis ) in our cages. These small pests climbed from the
walls on to the branches and from these down along the suspended
feeding-glasses sometimes in such numbers that the spouts of the
glasses were nearly stuffed up. We found that the Humming Birds
did not like this and consequently to some extent kept away from the
liquid food. By suspending the feeding-glasses in yet another piece of
steel-wire which goes through a small glass tube almost filled with
ordinary water and with a cork at the bottom, we have now been
able to stop this plague. The red ants cannot now get at the liquid
food and for this reason leave the cage in search of other food.
Before making use of our little " invention " the average quantity
of liquid food consumed by each Humming Bird during its twelve
feeding hours was 14*655 cm 3 , but afterwards 14*815 cm 3 . This shows
an average difference of 0*16 cm 3 , for each bird during its twelve
hours of feeding and besides it clearly shows how even small things
can be of importance in connection with the feeding and management
of difficult or delicate animals in captivity.
Humming Birds in captivity have to be constantly and carefully
examined. The claws should be cut when too long, as otherwise the
birds do not fly as much as they should. It has happened now and
then that some of the birds get a kind of paralysis of the tongue which
then cannot be withdrawn but remains more or less protruding from
the beak. Even if the tip of the tongue is quite dry, the bird is able
to live for quite a long time. I have been told that this is due to the
bird having caught a cold. I don't understand, however, how this
suddenly can happen to birds living in such a steady temperature.
We have tried to cure such a case by giving the bird aureomycin
dissolved in the food, but so far the result has not come up to our
expectations.
How long do the Humming Birds live in captivity ?
Unfortunately, I have only very little information from other
Zoological Gardens, and can only say that we have lost quite a lot
of Humming Birds since the war because they arrived in a miserable
condition. I have not yet had time to treat this matter statistically,
but I am able to state that 28 birds or more than 38 per cent of our
first stock (from 17th May, 1935, till 5th June, 1945) consisting of
74 Humming Birds lived more than one year, 8 birds or 11 per cent
lived more than two years, and 5 birds or 7 per cent lived more than
three years, 1 bird lived almost four years, and finally 1 bird eight
years less thirteen days.
For further details, I should like to refer to my articles in the
German periodical Der goologische Garten , 1941, vol. 13, page 167-178,
and the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 54, No. 3, pages 69-79.

By Terry Jones (Leckford, Hants, England)
It has been a fairly good season here, but when a collection is as
big and as varied as this one it is almost impossible to have a good
season with every kind of bird.
The Parrot family has done badly. We had a good pair of Princess
of Wales who reared young every year. This year the pair bred satis-
factorily, hatching four young and rearing three, all strong birds.
One night there must have been a cat or something on the aviary roof.
The aviary is 72 feet long, and the birds have distance enough to
acquire some speed, enough speed with which to kill themselves
against the wire, and unfortunately this is what happened, and now
we have the mother and one youngster only.
Incidentally, some people may not know that this species is one of
the few Parrakeets larger than a Grass Parrakeet which is not
destructive to shrubs. The Stanley Parrakeets excelled themselves
this year, laying six eggs and hatching and rearing one.
Last year we reared a number of Fischer's Lovebirds, and I decided
to keep them to try to build up a good breeding stock ! Even if I
could sell any of them to-day, I should hardly get any more for the
whole lot than I could have got for one pair of young birds last year.
This species bred quite well again this year.
And so we come to the Peach-faced Lovebirds. Here again we are
in trouble In 1950 we bred some nice young birds from a very old
pair which died last year. Then in Cage Birds in the autumn of 1950
I saw an advertisement offering three young unsexed Peach-faced for
sale. These I bought, and after marking them and our own three by
cutting a few feathers on the back of the head of one, shoulder of
another, tail of a third, and so on, we turned the six out together.
The food room window overlooks their outdoor flight, and the idea
was to watch the birds unobserved by them, and to note which fell
in love with what. It seemed a foolproof way of sexing these difficult
birds. Mrs. Milligan, whose charges they are, spent days, weeks, and
months watching them. They got along fine, and were nearly always
in pairs, but the snag from our point of view was that A who is sitting
with B , was sitting an hour ago with C, and has in fact sat with the
rest. My idea of a pair is the same as Noah's, but their idea of a
pair was two birds, simply that !
The summer of 1951 they spent all together. We never saw any
bird feed any other. We put up enough boxes to look like a 44 Develop-
ment Area " and supplied willow and lime boughs. The birds had a
grand time stripping the boughs and in clambering in and out of
boxes, but no material was carried into the boxes. This spring, 1952,
Mrs. Milligan had decided that A was now paired to B and C to D,

so they were put in separate aviaries. " They were not hatched till
August," we told each other, " and were too young to breed last year."
But nothing has happened at all this year till the other day, late
October, when B was seen to stuff a splinter in her rump feathers and
fly to a box. These boxes had not been removed, as no one seemed
in danger of egg-binding. However, they were promptly removed
and in early November B laid an egg from a perch. At last we know
the sex of one of the party, and now we must wait till 1953. This
has cheered us up so much that Mrs. Milligan has been rash enough to
say that she is certain that D also is a hen. Having spent two seasons
wondering whether all were males, I now am wondering whether
perhaps all are females. We tried sexing the birds by the width
between their pelvis bones, but anyone who has kept poultry knows
how much the width varies according to the state of the bird's ovaries.
In Nyasa Lovebirds we had an old bird and three youngsters,
which came from the Duke of Bedford. One bird died during the
winter. The three between them built two nests, but forgot to lay.
I must try to get some more of these nice little Lovebirds, and see
whether we can pair them up more successfully than we have the
Peach-faced.
The two Touracous we know are both hens and, as they do each
year, both laid and sat on their eggs. One of them is a delightfully
tame bird who has been here since 1938. The Sun Bittern, a charming
small owl from New Caledonia, or somewhere like that, are both
pre-war birds and continue to thrive, and so do the two cock Wonga-
wonga Pigeons, also pre-war birds.
The breeding results amongst the Pheasants is also mixed. We
will start with the bad news. No. 1 pair, Monals, had been together for
ten years, and were a very good breeding pair. Without any warning
the cock murdered his wife. No. 2 pair : Again a good breeding pair.
Something scared the hen one day in early spring, and she was found
limp and warm with a smashed skull. Pair No. 3 : A cock which was
very tame and a young two-year-old hen, daughter of one of the
above, who was laying for the first time. She laid j'ust one clutch of
eggs. Six, I think, were hatched and five reared. These five are
possibly all cocks !
Besides the above we have a very nice 1951 cock we had kept as a
store bird, intending to reserve him a mate from this year's crop.
Chinquis Peacock Pheasants are another poor patch. We lost
three old birds ; two of them the best pair we ever had, were well
pre-war. But we have some nice young pairs, so next year we should
be all right. Only two young were reared this year.
Elliotts were new birds. The cock went into a moult as the hens
started to lay. Only two eggs hatched, and these proved to be a pair,
but the cock unfortunately, though a very vigorous bird, has bad feet.

A young pair of Grey Jungle Fowl were also newcomers. The cockerel
crowed day and night, particularly at night. A cheerful guy, bred
from American stock, he shouted his curious call which sounded
to me like " Chum--hi-yeah ! hi-yeah--chum ! 55 He had ceased
crowing when his little hen eventually laid five eggs which proved
clear. Eight young Brown Crossoptilons were reared from one young
pair; the second pair did not breed. Incidentally, our males are
spurred, as was the pre-war European stock. Twenty-three Mikado
were reared, fine birds, but I am afraid a rather henny lot; 16
Temmincks Tragopans; 16 Blue Crossoptilons, 15 Swinhoes, n
Edwards, and 27 Amherst.
Swans. The old female Black Swan is at present a widow, and
having a well-earned rest from child rearing. She and her mate,
who came here as adults in 1937, have bred continuously ever since,
not quite managing three broods a year. They have hatched cygnets
in every month of the year, and have never lost a cygnet. She has
been single since February, but a mate should arrive soon. Her
daughter is due to start breeding next spring. The Whooper female
is a failure in that she prefers human society to Swan's. She lays every
year between eight and fourteen eggs upon which she dutifully sits.
Unfortunately, she almost always forgets that male Swans have a small
part to play. Only twice has she had a family, some years ago she had
two, and now she has a ewe lamb. I saw her bring this one to the
water. The father was delighted, and thinking he was going to play
the male Swan's role of guard and guide, he swam to meet his family.
He was promptly seized and thoroughly beaten up. Swans apparently
suffer from a social handicap which forbids a chap to thrash his wife,
however badly she behaves. He spent most of the subsequent weeks
standing on the bank. He is now suffered within the family circle,
but is hardly made welcome.
The Black-necked Swans are immature, or rather the female is.
We have three males and one female at present.
Geese. Six Greater Snow goslings were reared from our old Goose,
who must by now be the ancestress of most of the European stock, and
of quite a few of the American. Two Emperor, 4 Ross, 3 Barhead,
4 Redbreast, 8 Magellan, 6 Ashyhead, 10 Ruddyhead were reared.
The Abyssinian Bluewinged let me down. I acquired a completely
unrelated gander from the Severn Wildfowl Trust, and paired him to a
goose who has laid each year till this year. The gander never came
into full breeding condition, and so she did not lay. I am hoping to
make him madly jealous next year by giving him suitable neighbours.
Sheld-Duck. Nine Radjah were reared, also fifteen Ruddy and about
the same number each of Common and South African. The Red-
billed Pintail laid, but her pre-war mate was beyond breeding age.
We have now got a nice young male bred this year at Slimbridge.

T. JONES-1952 BREEDING RESULTS AT LEGKFORD II
We have been lucky in breeding each year for several years now a
species of waterfowl which either has not been bred previously or has
not been bred for many years as in the case of the Marbled Teal.
This year it was the Philippine Duck, A. luzonica.
The Severn Wildfowl Trust very kindly lent us their pair on
breeding terms. This species was well illustrated in the Avicultural
Magazine for Jan.-Feb., 1952. The male and female are similar
in colour, the body soft greyish stone, the neck and face a bright
rusty buff, top of the head and a broad eye streak are black, bill blue.
It is a handsome species, and in my opinion competes with the Spotbill
for second place in the Mallard beauty competition. The pair here
were very peaceful and I never saw the drake take the slightest notice
of any other species except of Mallard drakes, and to these he objected
very strongly. The drake's call is more drawling than a Mallard's.
He chatters very little to his duck or she to him. Her call is very
similar to a wild duck's. The drake's display seems much simplified.
The only form I have so far seen is what I call the fast-swimming
display. In this, like the Yellowbill drake, he swims fast either ahead
of his duck or round her; his body is elongated, and the base of his
neck awash, the head erect and jerked backwards and forwards. The
display is probably the same as the Yellowbills, but the above is all
I have seen so far. The duck courts him as does a Mallard female
her drake, but less violently, less often, and with far less chatter.
Mating is the same as the Yellowbill. The duck's first nest was made
in some rank grasses, and was a substantial affair, so much so that the
day the first egg was laid, 7th May, I was passing the nest, which
I already knew of, and a man who was nest-hunting nearby said:
" There's an egg in that scrape by the stick in the top block." #C What
colour is it? " " Greenish." I presumed it was a Red-crested Pochard's,
and did not go to collect it till after lunch, when the egg had vanished.
I put a dummy in the nest and, at a distance of about three feet, com-
pletely encircled it with a narrow band of kreosote. A good way of
protecting a nest from ground vermin. No sniffler will cross the
band. The following morning I looked first thing. The dummy was
there and beside it an egg of the palest eau-de-nil, almost white. The
egg was of normal shape, and between a Shoveler's and a Red-crested
Pochard's in size, but when compared with these it was paler and the
colour very clean, not muddy as are the other two. Dr. Ripley describes
his ducks' eggs as very round. I think all species of duck, tree duck
excepted, tend to lay a normal shaped egg, but individuals vary greatly.
One of my Shovelers lays sausage-shaped eggs, while the other lays
normal ones; both hatch equally well. Ten eggs including the missing
one were laid on consecutive days. Down was very like the Common
Pintails. Incubation 25-26 days. The ducklings on hatching were
comically like their parents in design. The body colour was olive,

vaguely showing the Mallard family flank and hip markings, but the
necks and faces were bright yellow plus dark eye streak and cap as in
the adults. In the first plumage the head markings seemed identical
to the adult plumage, but the body plumage lacked the grapelike
bloom of the adult. They grew quickly, and were easily reared.
The old duck made a second nest under a Guelder rose bush. The nest
was again a bulky affair, composed chiefly of sycamore leaves which
had lodged under the bush. She laid seven eggs, and then had some
internal trouble, failed to lay the eighth, and was dead by 10.30 a.m.
We removed this egg from her body, but it was the only egg which
failed to hatch. Fifteen ducklings were reared to maturity.
The little American Ruddy Duck laid well ; her extraordinary
eggs, almost as big as a Sheld-Duck's, were of the same lovely shagreen
texture as the Black Swan's.
Heartbreaking creatures to rear under a hen, because they can
barely walk, and will only feed in water. They won't leave their
mother's flanks, and she would not swim ! However, we eventually
reared four, all females. Next year we hope to do better now we
know what we are in for.

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
The breeding season of 1952 produced, on the whole, rather more
than the average crop of troubles and disappointments. March went
out like a lion after deceptively lamb-like behaviour earlier. As a
result both my hen Princess of Wales Parrakeets got egg-bound. One
died later of another complaint, and the other did not nest a second
time. The eggs, given to Rock Peplars, failed to hatch. Later in the
year I also lost one of my cocks from a mysterious injury.
The hen Crimson-wing of the breeding pair also got badly egg-
bound, and I thought I should lose her, but she laid in the end,
although the eggs, given to Green-winged Kings, failed to hatch.
I think I am now well and truly cured of allowing early breeding
with many species of Parrakeets. Even if the hens escape egg-binding,
the fertility of the cocks early in the season is apt to be poor.
I did not put the Crimson-wing back in her breeding aviary again
until mid-May. She laid again and reared four fine youngsters.
My old pair of Rock Peplars reared three young ones and a new pair
consisting of an imported Victorian cock, and an English-bred hen
reared four. Rock Peplars from Victoria are much to be preferred
to those from Western Australia on account of the fine clear yellow
colour of the cocks. I also had a 1951 cock that had been trained as

a liberty bird, and I used, for a time successfully, in training the
Victorian cock's four offspring. After a few weeks, however, he
disgraced himself by going off, taking the young hen with him. Some
weeks later she returned alone, so presumably he met with an accident.
As a rule young Rock Peplars, properly trained and managed, can be
flown as day-liberty birds with perfect safety for about six weeks,
and great is the enjoyment to be derived from their superb flight.
If allowed out much longer they tend to go wild and eventually are
lost, so that it is necessary to catch them up and confine them until
the cocks have mated, when the presence of their wives in aviaries
should " anchor " them for good. Hens are always worse stayers
than cocks, and are better kept in as soon as their sex can be deter-
mined with some degree of probability.
Green-winged Kings, as usual, had two lots of clear eggs. They
seem to be too old to be fertile, although they are most eager to
go to nest.
Browns repeated their disappointing failure of last year, losing
their young for no obvious reason at about io days.
In the spring I had obtained three imported Browns, but they
seemed to have no constitution at all, and got ill again and again
even while still in the heated birdroom. One hen soon died of an
unusual throat ailment. The cock, after about half a dozen illnesses,
swallowed the bristle of a brush which at length finished him. After
that his mate, who had been getting ill even oftener than he, blossomed
out into robust health and breeding condition. Who says there isn't
an X ! ?
Two pairs of English-bred Pileated Parrakeets each hatched their
six eggs, but made a poor job of rearing, only three young surviving
in each case. The old birds plucked their offspring, one pair very
badly, the cock being as serious an offender as his mate.
The hen Barnard would not settle down. She only laid one egg
and did not sitr
The Blue Indian Ringnecks did better, rearing four young. I tried
a year-old cock blue with a lutino hen but, though he displayed,
he was too young to mate and the eggs were infertile. Later the hen
died and a pair of two-year-old lutino-bred greens lost their young,
probably through the hen getting ill.
Gang-gang Cockatoos reared a pair of young, but the hen injured
herself severely the day she left the nest. She is now, however, nearly
well.
Roseate Cockatoos this year were a failure. The old albino hen
mated to her son laid again after an interval of nearly fifteen years,
but the eggs were infertile. Another white-bred cock mated to a
normal grey hen did not breed, although the hen had nested regularly
in previous years. Two young 1951 normal Roseates which I hoped to

establish as liberty birds behaved in a disappointing fashion, although
those that one breeds are normally good stayers. I first released the
young hen. She went out quietly and looked like settling down, but
the following day she removed herself to the Battlesden area, about
three miles away, where she settled down as a wild bird. Her brother,
when first released, stayed well, and after a few weeks I used the
parent cock as a decoy and captured his erring daughter without
difficulty and brought her home. For a short time she stayed well
with her brother, then the pair returned to Battlesden. After some
weeks one returned and spent a few hours at the aviaries, but again
went off in the Battlesden direction, and soon all news of them ceased.
(By a very strange coincidence Pennant's Parrakeets were bred at
liberty at Battlesden in 1871, forty-three years before I bred them at
liberty at Woburn !)
A lutino cock Nyasa Lovebird mated to a green hen did not nest
this year, and pretended to be terribly nervous, although they had
lived in aviaries and wintered in cages for years. Possibly these love-
birds, like budgerigars, nest more readily in colonies.
As the cock I had obtained with much difficulty had died suddenly
during the winter, my two hen Naretha Bluebonnets continued in
unrelieved spinsterhood and, like the widowed hen Browns, in much
more robust health than they had enjoyed when there was a prospect
of getting them mated !
This year I started a new aviary of liberty Budgerigars in Devon-
shire, the foundation stock consisting partly of homing birds from
Woburn and partly of non-homers. They were kept shut into the
aviary until the young of the first round were leaving the nest, and
when released the homers behaved as well in their new locality as
they had done in the old one. The non-homers, as at the beginning
of my experiment at Woburn, either proved " non-exits " and did
not go out at all, or gave a certain amount of trouble by straying.
Of those that strayed and were reported and recaptured with the
aid of a spare cage containing food and another cage with a decoy,
some proved sensible the second time, and some did not go out again.
Budgerigars and other Parrakeets, on finding themselves free, may
go off for different reasons. Some depart because they really want
to go. Others do not really wish to leave, but are puzzled and con-
fused by their unaccustomed freedom, and lose their heads and their
way. Very quickly, however, they learn to manage themselves in the
air and to fly down , and if they can be recaptured may give no more
trouble. The other type are, however, hopeless as liberty birds. Very
young birds only just able to feed themselves will usually " home "
for a time, even to a new aviary if it contains plenty of others of their
species, but their subsequent performance will depend on how they
are bred. Young birds whose eyes and ceres are beginning to change

colour are at the worst age for release in a strange place. Even homers
that have flown at liberty elsewhere are not to be relied on. If
purchased at this age they must be confined until they have bred, and
their young are leaving the nest.
The homing Budgerigars at Woburn started the season very well,
but I made two mistakes later that taught a rather unexpected
lesson. In previous years I had allowed some birds to continue
breeding until late autumn, although I did not permit any individual
pair to rear more than two broods. This season, however, the
Budgerigars were staying so well and the aviary was getting so over-
crowded that instead of disposing of surplus stock then, as I should
have done, I stopped all breeding in the aviary. I also made what
proved to be another mistake. Previously the birds in the liberty
aviary had never all gone out together. Some always remained
inside. One day, however, I drove them all out at once, and although
some began to re-enter within a few minutes it was clear that I had
caused a psychological upset. The birds that came in were much
disturbed at finding the aviary empty. " The place didn't feel the
same," and after feeding quickly and nervously they flew about
restlessly like wild birds trapped in an enclosure, and quickly made
their way out again. This and the stopping of all breeding had a
curious and lasting effect on the mentality of all the occupants of the
aviary. They became wild and scary ; lost their steadiness and
would no longer feed from millet sprays held in my hand ; were
subject to panics and stayed in the shelter long after sunrise as they
do when there is a Sparrowhawk about. Young hens did not come
into breeding condition and select nest boxes eight weeks after leaving
the nest themselves, as is usual. They moulted and still showed no
interest in nesting. Finally they began to stray, going off in small
parties and--which had never happened before--even some old
breeding birds of both sexes were among those that left. To check
this tendency I introduced, from the hens' resting aviary, three
homing hens I judged to be in breeding condition; but these also
showed no interest in the nest boxes, and two even went away.
1 then kept the birds shut up entirely for about a fortnight,
introducing four more homing hens from the resting aviary. That did
the trick. After a few days these hens selected mates and nest-boxes.
Their example infected all the young hens of different ages, and they
too rushed into breeding condition. The temperament of all the
birds in the aviary likewise changed ; their tameness returned ; and
when they were again released there was no more straying, even among
unmated birds.
It is clear, therefore, that the attraction which " anchors " homing
Budgerigars to their aviary is its significance to them as a breeding
place. This must on no account be upset except of course during

the winter, when the short days and absence of wild foods reduce the
temptation to stray to a minimum. Next year I intend to arrange
two breeding 44 shifts ". Towards the end of February I shall introduce
about eight fully adult hens, leaving them to select their partners from
the considerably larger number of cocks occupying the aviary. At the
end of June, when they have reared their second broods, I shall put
them and, for a few days, their mates also in the resting aviary,
providing another eight hens for the cocks that have not yet bred.
I shall have the first catch-up of surplus young birds about the same
time, and may confine the whole flock for some days to allow the
new adult hens to choose their nests and mates and the young hens to
profit by the good example set them ! Past experience has shown
that it does a hen no harm whatever to allow her to have one nest as
soon as she wants to, provided she lays before ist September. Her
young may not always grow into large birds, but there is rarely much
wrong with them either. Cocks that have bred early in the season
I shall return to the liberty aviary as soon as the second lot of adult
hens have mated. They can then moult and rest and, as the aviary
will still have a 44 breeding atmosphere," they are not likely to stray.
Experience has again shown that whereas a 44 breeding atmosphere "
is a vital factor, it is not necessary for every cock in the aviary to be
mated to keep him at home.
For waterfowl the season has been the worst I ever remember.
Never before have vermin been so active in destroying eggs, young,
and sitting birds, and never before, among the geese, have so few
pairs gone to nest or so many eggs proved infertile--under conditions
identical with those which in previous years have produced quite
good results. The only geese reared have been one Emperor, one
Red-breasted, and one Magellan, and the only ducks (apart from
wild Mandarins), about two dozen Carolina.

The news of the death of Madame Jeanne Derscheid which occurred
at a few minutes past midnight on the night of 2nd-grd January, 1953,
will be received with the greatest sorrow by her many friends in the
Avicultural Society. The British and Americans have particular cause
to be grateful to Madame Derscheid, her husband, and their family
for the great part they took in the Escape Service which achieved the
safety of many British and American airmen during the last world war ;
a service for which Dr. Jean-Marie Derscheid gave his life. On two
occasions Madame Derscheid was imprisoned as a hostage on account
of her husband's activities and was decorated for her own services with
the Medaille de Prisonniere Politique , Medaille de la Comunne , and Medaille
departicipation aux oeuvres de Guerre. In 1948 Madame Derscheid received
from Field-Marshal Montgomery the late King George Vi's Commen-
dation for Brave Conduct which His Majesty had commanded she
should receive personally on behalf of her husband in recognition of
special services he rendered to the Allied cause during the war and
which proved of particular value to Great Britain. Madame Derscheid
was also presented with a similar Certificate by the U.S. Ambassador
in Belgium expressing the gratitude and appreciation of the American
people for the gallant service performed by her husband in assisting
the escape of Allied soldiers from the enemy.
Madame Derscheid shared her husband's interest in birds and
aviculture and actively assisted with the famous collection at Armendy
before the war, particularly in the rearing of rare ducks. In 1929 and
1930 she accompanied Dr. Derscheid to the Belgian Congo, when he
led a scientific expedition to Kivu and the regions of the Albert
National Park.
After the war Madame Derscheid made many visits to England and
was on three occasions the guest of honour at dinners of the British
Aviculturists' Club. Though assured of a warm welcome as the wife of
a great aviculturist she earned a special place for herself in the
affections of everyone who met her by her gentle charm, natural
friendliness, and spontaneous gaiety. Madame Derscheid took a great
interest in all the affairs of the Avicultural Society and was instru-
mental in procuring numbers of new members in Belgium ; she also
organized the Belgian participation in the most successful Anglo-
Belgian-French week-end meeting of aviculturists which was held at
Cleres in May, 1950.
Her premature death after a severe illness which she bore with
outstanding courage is yet another tragic loss to her son, Jean-Pierre
Derscheid, and the deepest sympathy is offered to him and his grand-
mother, Madame Gustav Derscheid, in their great sorrow. P. B-S.

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
During last year (1952) we received a few welcome and rarely-
imported birds at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm.
The first to arrive was a pure lutino Plumhead Parrakeet;
then came two pairs of Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeons ( Ptilinopus coronu-
latus), and half a dozen Citron-crested Cockatoos ( Cacatua citrino-
cristata), followed by six Layard's Parrakeets ( Psittacula calthorpas), and
finally, three pairs of the Cuban or White-fronted Amazon Parrots
(Amazona leucocephala ).
Layard's Parrakeet is very rarely imported indeed, probably because
of its restricted range, as it is entirely confined to the Island of Ceylon,
and does not extend to any part of the Indian mainland. The six we
have are young birds of the year, and were very kindly presented to us
by Major Weinman of the Colombo Zoo, who, with his wife and
son, paid a visit to our farm about a year ago, and we are most
grateful to him for this welcome gift.
To take the first arrival first : The lutino Plumhead was an
immature and rather delicate-looking specimen, and twice it nearly
died. At first it shared an aviary with an ordinary green hen, and
both were given sweetened bread and milk and millet spray, as well
as apple and the ordinary seed mixture. At first they ignored the
latter, having been sent over on nothing but small brown Indian
millet. Later on, however, both (as we supposed at the time) started
to eat the normal seed mixture, and the daily amount of bread and
milk and millet spray was gradually reduced, although a plentiful
daily supply of apple was still maintained. The lutino, however,
showed increasing signs of weakness, and it was only just in time that
we discovered that it was the hen alone who had taken to the normal
seed mixture. After that the lutino was put in an aviary by itself
and given plenty of bread and milk, apple, and millet spray. Even
so, however, it did not really seem to flourish and eventually got a
bad chill and had to be put in the hospital. It was very weak, and
I had not much hope of saving it ; nevertheless, it finally pulled
round, and the fact that it is alive and very flourishing to-day is really
due to the fact that I happened to put it to share an aviary with a
heated shelter with a pair of the Fruit Pigeons. The latter's staple diet
consists of boiled maize and rice sweetened with Nestle's milk, and
having sampled these the Plumhead decided at once that they were
the ideal diet for a delicate Parrakeet, in which apparently it was right,
for it has never once looked back since it started eating them. After
the autumn moult it assumed full adult plumage with the typical long
tapering tail of a Plumhead, and is now very handsome with a bright
golden-yellow body and flesh-pink head.

E. J. BOOSEY-FIVE RARE NEW ARRIVALS AT KESTON 1 9
The two pairs of Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeons (which, incidentally,
were sold as Jambu Fruit-Pigeons and not as Lilac-crowns) were
sent to us by air from Singapore, and arrived in quite good condition,
in spite of the fact that they had been given nothing but ordinary
uncooked maize to eat on the journey. They seem even more quarrel-
some than ordinary doves and pigeons and one of the hens bullied
the other so badly that the pairs had to be separated with all speed.
Nor did they hesitate to attack the Plumhead Parrakeet when it
was first put in an aviary with them, buffeting it with their wings if
it ventured anywhere near them. Now, however, the three have
formed one of those improbable bird friendships, and it is a curious
sight to see the two Fruit Pigeons and the Parrakeet sitting side by
side on a perch, so close together as to be actually touching--all their
former enmity forgotten !
The Fruit Pigeons are very beautiful, a rough description of them
being that they are green, with a wide diffused orange band across the
breast, in the centre of this band being a patch of pale violet. The
feathers of the neck and crop are grey with a greenish tinge and are
rather stiff and pointed, like the feathers of a cock's hackle, and the
crown of the head is a very lovely rosy-lilac colour narrowly bordered
with yellow. They inhabit the Aru Islands and New Guinea, and
are quite small.
Some species of Fruit Pigeons--and I rather think this one among
them--have been given the reputation of being hardy if shut into a
cosy shelter on winter nights, but although this may be the case
once they are thoroughly acclimatized, they certainly need heat
during their first winter in this country. Ours arrived about the end
of August, and I was able to put them in outdoor aviaries as soon as
they had recovered from the journey. Directly the weather became
at all cold, however, it was obvious that they would have to be given
heat, but although we have had some quite sharp frosts of late, one
pair are so far doing very well in an aviary with a lamp in the
shelter. This pair is the better of the two, and with the other pair
we had a stroke of bad luck, as the cock got a chill as soon as the
weather started to turn cold. He was put in a hospital cage, and was
recovering when the heat supply failed during the night, and he was
found dead in the morning, so we now have a pair and an odd hen,
and I shall keep the latter and hope to breed a mate for her next
summer. This, incidentally, would not be a first breeding, as Captain
Stokes successfully bred Lilac-crowns on more than one occasion
some years ago, and found that, like the Ruddy Quail Dove and
Bleeding-heart Pigeon (both of which we bred at Keston before the
war) the young leave the nest at a very tender age.
Judging by our Lilac-crowns, Fruit Pigeons differ in several respects
from the grain-eating species : they fly quickly but less gracefully

than the latter ; the under-surface of their feet is flatter and they
have a tenacious and rather reptilian way of gripping one's finger
or a perch, which doubtless enables them to clamber swiftly about
among the branches of the trees on the fruits of which they feed ;
also they seem very silent birds, and I have never heard ours utter
more than an occasional low murmuring sound, though they may
become more vocal in the spring.
They have proved unexpectedly easy to cater for in the matter of
food, and ours have come into excellent condition on a diet consisting
solely of boiled kibbled maize and rice sweetened with Nestle's milk
and then drained, with cored, peeled, ripe sweet chopped-up apple
added each day before it is given. This diet has the added advantage
of keeping their faces as clean as possible, whereas I find that if
they are given mushy fruits such as plums and bananas they get
themselves in a fearful mess.
I had somehow never thought of Citron-crested Cockatoos as
particularly attractive, but the six that arrived here by air and in
excellent condition quickly made me change my opinion of them,
and I think that with their lovely combination of orange, palest
lemon-yellow, and snow-white, they closely rival Leadbeater's for
beauty. The general body-colour is white, with the under surface of
the tail and a patch on the cheeks pale yellow. The crest, which is
very large, particularly in the male, who can spread it almost as far
forward as a Leadbeater's, is bright orange.
Many birds are stupidly named--this one being a good example--
and I cannot imagine why, when a bird with a crest the colour of a
ripe lemon was aptly named the Lemon-crested, or Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo another bird with a crest the colour of a ripe orange should
not have been named, with equal aptness, the Orange-crested
Cockatoo--and it is only fair to add that the inhabitants of its native
land have apparently had the sense to call it this ! as we were offered
them not as Citron-crested but as Orange-crested Cockatoos.
Their one disadvantage is their extreme shyness. The cock of our
pair is even shyer than the hen, who does very occasionally venture out
into the open part of the run if she thinks there is nobody about.
Another peculiarity--and one that would be a great advantage if one
of these Cockatoos was kept as a pet in a room--is that they are an
extremely silent member of an extremely noisy family, and I cannot
recall having heard either of ours utter a sound of any kind, except
when they were being caught to be transferred to their present aviary.
The Layard's are charming little birds and quite tame and steady.
They are about the size of a Plumhead, but their tails, instead of
being long and tapering, are quite short. The six Major Weinman has
given us are as yet in immature plumage and are predominantly
green, brighter on the head, and brightest just below the blackish

neck-ring which is just starting to appear in some of them. The two
central tail feathers are fairly dark blue tipped with greenish-yellow,
and the rump is lilac-blue. Four of them have red beaks, and the
other two black ones, so it looks as though we have two pairs and two
odd birds. I am not, however, certain of this particularly because one
of those with red beaks has to my mind an unmistakably feminine look
about it, and its beak rather looks as though it may be in the process
of turning black. I am not certain about the colour changes of the
beak in young Layard's, but in their relative, the Malabar Parrakeet,
young males have the curious, and I should think unique, habit of
starting with a red beak which later turns black, and later still turns
red again ! Young females, on the other hand, merely start with a red
beak which later turns black.
Adult Layard's are most attractively coloured, having the head
lavender-blue and the mantle the same colour shot with grey. The
young Layard's have settled down well in an aviary facing south with
a heated shelter in which they are shut each night. Like the lutino
Plumhead, they all eat bread soaked in sweetened watered milk,
and are very fond of boiled sweetened maize and rice, all of which
should prove valuable additional rearing foods if we are successful in
breeding them.
The last birds to arrive were the three pairs of Cuban Amazons--
the first we have ever been offered since we started the farm. I have
always thought them one of the loveliest members of the family, as the
deep rose-pink of the cheeks and throat goes so beautifully with their
main body-colour of green and the feathers of the head, neck,
and forepart of the body strikingly bordered with black. The crown
is white, and there is a considerable amount of purplish vinous-
colour on the lower breast and abdomen. The beak is very pale,
almost white. They are considerably smaller and slimmer than
Blue-fronts, and seem fairly easy to sex, as the hens have smaller,
rounder heads and the rose-pink area in their plumage is rather
less extensive and not so well-defined.
The three pairs we have are in an outdoor aviary with a heated
shelter, and have not yet been let out into the flight, as I think they are
far better off inside so long as this arctic weather, which this year has
come so unseasonably early, persists--which I sincerely hope it will
not do for long, as we usually get quite enough of it in the first three
months of the year.

REARING CONDORS IN CAPTIVITY IN THE

By Kenton G. Lint (San Diego, Calif., U.S.A.)
The Andean Condor, Vultur gryphus Linne, is an inhabitant of the
mountain chain of the Andes. It is found principally in the Peruvian
and Chilean Andes, but it also ranges as far north as Bogotd, and
south to the mouth of the Rio Nigro on the east coast of Patagonia.
According to the early observers, it was described as frequenting the
loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras, but later writers deny this, and say
it rarely ascends above 16,000 feet, while the normal range is the zone
lying between 9,000 and 15,000 feet.
The Andean Condor is not only the largest of the birds of prey, but
the largest land bird of flight. Over a period of ten years, 1942-1952,
the Zoological Society of San Diego has hatched eight Condor babies
and reared seven Condor chicks to maturity. All seven birds are
living and on exhibition in Zoological Gardens in the United States.
The first Andean Condor raised in captivity in the United States
was hatched 8th July, 1942, in the Zoological Gardens of San Diego,
in our large flying cage. The first baby proved to be a male, and was
sold to the Washington D.C. Zoo, where it is still on exhibition.
Again, on 8th June, 1945, the second Andean Condor baby was
hatched and raised, another male bird.
On 21 st June, 1947, our breeding pair of Condors hatched their
third chick. We were a little disappointed, as this baby was also
a male. We removed this bird from the old pair just before nesting
time, to see if they would nest in consecutive years.
This strategy did work, and on 20th May, 1948, the fourth baby
Condor was hatched, breaking the old precedent that Condors only
raise every other year. This baby, our first female chick, was removed
from the parent birds when four weeks old, and raised to maturity
by hand feeding. Weights and feather growth were recorded weekly,
and much was learned in rearing this young bird. The difficulties
in the way of field studies would make it impossible to acquire the same
knowledge in the wild. We fed one half pound of finely ground liver
twice a day, and one half pound of finely ground horse meat twice
daily.
On 7th June, 1949, the fifth Condor was hatched, a male, and
raised to maturity by the parent birds.
Experimenting in hatching Condor eggs in an electric incubator,
we hatched the sixth chick 31st May, 1950. This baby, a female chick,
lived seven days. Our breeding pair laid a second egg which hatched
10th July, 1950, also a female chick, which they raised to maturity.

On 23rd May, 1951, the eighth Andean Condor baby was success-
fully hatched, this one in an incubator. It was raised to maturity by
hand feeding. This male chick weighed six ounces at the time of
hatching. Shipped to Liberty Park, Salt Lake City, Utah, at the age
of eleven months, the bird weighed 34 pounds. This bird was fed
on tenderized food from the time of hatching, without the use of
regurgitation as used by the parent birds. To our knowledge this has
not been done before successfully in captivity.
Our breeding pair of Andean Condors were purchased, male,
29th June, 1929, female, 3rd March, 1934. The male Condor was

In the zoological park Dierenpark C# Wassenaar " a new large bird-
house is being built and will be the home of the zoo's interesting
collection of birds, about which I had the honour to inform our
members in the Avicultural Magazine of July-August, 1951.
The birdhouse, which will be opened in spring of 1953, is a large
glass construction measuring over 400 feet in length with a width of
over 60 feet and a maximum height of 21 feet. The President of the
Society, Mr. P. W. Louwman, was kind enough to give me a rough
outline of the plans of the internal construction of this large building.
From what I saw of the great aviaries which are now under con-
struction in the building, I expect that when everything is completed
this birdhouse will be not only the most beautiful but will also guarantee
the most appropriate housing for the bird collection of this zoo.

Over i oo enclosures of varying size are expected to be filled with a
considerable variety of rare birds, such as : Quetzals, Cock of the
Rock, Birds of Paradise, Greater Hornbills, Toucans, Crowned
Pigeons, a considerable number of Parrakeets and Lorikeets, and an
abundance of other birds.
The aim is to give the spectator a view of the birds in natural
surroundings, but in this the management has given more attention to
the actual biological needs of the birds than to purely ornamental
adornments, which are so often advertised as natural surroundings,
but which are very often only very poor imitations and generally do not
fulfil the most elementary demands of practical birdkeeping.
From what I saw I am quite sure that the Louise Hall (named in
honour of the late Mrs. L. Louwman-de Brey, mother of the President)
will be an achievement, which will be greeted with enthusiasm by all
aviculturists and which no doubt will attract much attention.

Mareca penelope (L), M. sibilatrix (Poeppig)
A. GENERAL.
Both species are only being mentioned as a kind of appendix as
I do not know them nearly well enough. Both, through the lack of
a social play and through their highly specialized method of pair
formation, which in M. sibilatrix is quite reminiscent of that of the
Anserinae, stand out sharply from the pattern of the rest of the surface-
feeding ducks. The following facts are important taxonomic char-
acteristics which separate both species sharply from other Anatinse :
(1) the almost uniform colour of the plumage of the female M. penelope
which completely lacks the lengthwise marking so widely prevalent on
the flight feathers ; (2) the dark chestnut-brown summer plumage of

the drake ; (3) the showy plumage of the female with green feathers on
the head, found only in M. sibilatrix ; (4) the colour of the ducklings,
whose heads are almost entirely of one colour with no long stripes.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
Conversation and call-notes of both sexes are strangely reduced.
The female M. penelope has really only one call, a whirring " Rerrr ",
to which there corresponds in the South American female a deeper
" Arrr ". The drakes of both species have entirely lost all calls and are
dependent upon their highly specialized courtship-whistles for all
audible utterance. The whistle which is most commonly heard in the
European species consists of one syllable, something like " W i i rrr ",
and in sibilatrix cocks it is composed of two syllables and sounds some-
thing like " W i b urrr ". Both use the whistle as a call and as a
warning. It is uttered just the same, for example, when a cat sneaks
past as when a female flies over the pond.
C. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF BOTH SEXES.
In both species these are combined in a ceremony, composed of inciting
Fig. 44.--The mutual chin-lifting of the Wigeon pair, Mareca penelope (L). The little
arrow indicates the direction and the degree of the trembling, vertical, inciting
movement of the hen. Compare Figs. 3, 32, 42, and 45. Notice the differentiation

and chin-lifting together, which is certainly homologous to that of the
Gadwall. It is interesting to note that in M. penelope there is a slight
indication of the introduction to display, a thing which I have never
seen in sibilatrix. The drake swims to the female uttering a two-
syllabled sound, which is expressed best by the English name of the
duck, " Wigeon." He shakes his head in a brief introductory move-
ment and follows it with a very meticulous mock-preening, which the
duck sometimes answers with the same movement. For the most part
she begins with her peculiar trembling, jerky chin-lifting, whereupon
the drake, with the base of his neck sunk deep in the water, at the same
time sets up a synchronous chin-lifting which is not repeated in a
trembling movement, like that of the hen but is performed only once
and is linked with a loud whistle (Figs. 44 and 45). The whirring

<bodyText confidence="0.999410588235294" page_id="56291779"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
sound made by the female, which accompanies the continuous chin-
lifting, in which a great number of upward movements are suggested,
is, in its accentuation, to be considered a very aberrant form of the
inciting of other surface-feeding ducks, and sounds like an apparently
continuous " errr ". The position she takes corresponds to that of
inciting. The female of M. sibilatrix lacks the tremulous repetition in
its head movement, both sexes lifting the chin with a single move-
ment before which the bill is tipped slightly downward. Like the
plumage of the female, her courtship movements are drake-like.
The voice of the female sounds deeper, more like " arr ", and the
whistle of the cock is a two-syllabled " wiburrrr ". In the two species
the movements and notes of both mates are so well co-ordinated that
the whole very peculiar sound pattern sounds very simple. Naumann,
as we know, ascribes both sounds, the whistling and the whirring, to
both sexes of the Wigeon. The ceremony has throughout the character
of a true triumph-cry, whose function is quite similar to that of the
triumph-cry of the Anserinae and Casarcinae. Therefore I rather suspect
Fig. 45.--The mutual chin-lifting of the pair of Chiloe Wigeon, Mareca sibilatrix.
Both mates perform the same movement ; the behaviour pattern reminds one
in its significance of the triumph-cry of geese.
that there are in the European Wigeon at least some indications of the
male's care of the young. For sibilatrix the latter has been ascertained.
XVIII. MARECA SIBILATRIX X ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS
A. GENERAL.
Although I have hitherto omitted from my discussion the many
hybrid ducks that I have already studied and whose behaviour-
inventory I might easily have given, I cannot help touching briefly
upon the hybrids named above, which I received through Professor
Heck's kindness from the Berlin Zoological Gardens, where a full-
winged wild Mallard duck has lived for years, mated to a sibilatrix
drake. Physically the birds were pretty well intermediate between
the parent species, although the male had much less of the Mallard
drake's colouring than the hybrids Poll (1910) had pictured. Above
all he had little green on his head, distributed just as in the Chiloe

Wigeon. The two birds were paired, laid, and brooded sterile eggs
every year and flew around freely for years, until the duck flew away
in the winter of 1939-40, while the drake, who had survived this bad
time, became frightened by my catching the other ducks before my
move to Konigsberg and stayed away.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
These were exactly like those of the Mallard. The drake had
both the one- and the two-syllabled call of the Mallard drake, except
that his voice was softer and hoarser.
C. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.
Inciting.
This cannot be described more briefly than with the assertion that
it was like that of neither the one nor the other parent species, but
resembled even to the smallest detail that of the Gadwall. The
tendency, inherited from M. sibilatrix, to break into chin-raising at
every sexual excitement was combined with the urge to perform the
inciting act over the shoulder, which the duck had inherited from her
mother, with the result that between every two chin-raisings there came
an inciting movement backwards over the shoulder. As the drake
lifted his chin at the same time as the duck, there arose a ceremony
which was not very different from that of the Gadwall.
The Decrescendo Call.
This was hoarser and broken off shorter than in the Mallard.
A nod-swimming was lacking.
The Prelude to Mating.
This corresponded to that of the Mallard. However, sometimes
instead of this both birds carried out the intention-behaviour of
diving away before treading, just like the beginning of play-diving
before midday bathing. Unfortunately I do not know whether this
diving-away occurs as a prelude to mating in Mareca. Heinroth has
described something corresponding to this in Tadorna.
D. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND CALLS OF THE DRAKE.
i. The General Form of the Display.
This was peculiarly split in two. On the one hand the drake wooed
his duck in the manner of Wigeons ; on the other hand he mixed
in the company-play of Mallard drakes without bothering about her
in the least. Leiner described a corresponding cleavage in the taxes
of hybrids of the three-spined Stickle-back which nests on the bottom
and the nine-spined Stickle-back which builds up in the water plants.

This was marked by the omission of nod-swimming, that is to say,
the drake, after treading, rose slightly in a manner suggestive of the
" bridling " movement and then swam around the duck very leisurely
without nodding, but paying much attention to her and keeping the
back of his head exactly toward her.
5. Chin-Lifting.
This is done in unison and is similar to a triumph-ceremony,
corresponding entirely to that of the Gadwall.

XIX. THE CAROLINA DUCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960557875" page_id="56291781"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
Lampronessa sponsa (L)
A. GENERAL.
Here we come to a group which some experts class with the true
surface-feeding ducks and others with the Cairininae. As a matter of
fact this quite independent sub-family, which consists of only two
genera, Lampronessa and Aix , is almost midway between the two.
Characters which they have in common with the Cairininae are the
following : (a) Certain markings in the ducklings ; ( b ) certain physical
characteristics resulting from their living on trees and nesting in
holes, such as the very long thigh and, therefore, legs that seem to be
very far forward on the body ; and also the long broad tail ; (r) certain
undoubtedly primitive characters in their behaviour. The true
Cairininae, together with the Carolina and Mandarin ducks, are the
only Anatidae which make aiming head movements before flying up,
quite like those of birds of prey, pigeons, and innumerable other
orders, but quite unlike the pre-flight movements of all other Anatidae.
A further point the genera Aix, Lampronessa, and other Cairininae
have in common is that the nystagmic nodding of the head, which
occurs when the bird is walking does not take place with every step,
as in almost all other birds, but in a most unusual and striking manner
at every second step ; thus, the head always goes forward at the same
time as the one leg, which almost gives the impression that the bird is
limping. Without doubt the genus Cairinina is unusually rich in primitive
characteristics, a thing which Heinroth, Delacour, and Boetticher
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.984316522727273" page_id="56291782"  page_num="29" year="" vol="">
DR. KONRAD LORENZ-STUDIES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF ANATIN^E 29
have already pointed out. The black-white marking of the plumage
and the bare face-mask remind one of Anseranas. The completely
reptilian rape of the female, and the complete lack of pairing can also
be regarded as primitive characteristics. Now although Aix and
Lampronessa are undoubtedly highly differentiated forms, very nearly
related to true surface-feeding ducks, I prefer to class them funda-
mentally with the Gairininae in agreement with Delacour and Boetticher.
This group, in spite of its clear relationship to forms rich in primitive
characters, contains some very highly differentiated forms, analogous,
for example, to the Herpestoidae in the Carnivora, in which forms
like Mungos and Crossarchus exhibit a truly insectivore-like primitive-
ness, while others in their specialization almost intergrade with the
completely separate higher group of Felidae, such as the Civet Cat
Viverra , the Palm Civet Parodoxurus , or even the Fossa Cryptoprocta
ferox.
The Carolina Duck's reactions were exhaustively described by
Heinroth in 1910. We shall only give them briefly for the sake of
comparison.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
Except with very small ducklings the two-syllabled conversation
call of the Anatinae is lacking. In the whistle of desertion the one-
syllabled " piep " call does not sound at the same intervals as in the
Anatinae but, especially at moments of high intensity, in couplets,
but not so close that they sound like two syllables. We have already
spoken of the intention-behaviour for flying away which is distinctive
for the whole group. The duck's " go-away " call, which is heard
especially when she is looking for the nest, is a soft rapid " tetetetetet ".
That used by the drake in the corresponding mood is a delicate
" jibjibjibjib ". As a conversation note the drake utters a short
" ji-ib ", accented on the second syllable, which one hears especially
when he is paying " polite " attention to the duck. The call-note
of the drake is a drawn-out " ji-ihb " ; the duck's call-note is a more
raucous " ku-ack ". While the calls noted are analogous in significance
to what may also be homologous utterances of many Anatinae, the
warning call of the female is a peculiarly short " Huick ". As in the
Anatinae, the drake's warning call corresponds to the call-note. While
these two calls of the Anatinae cannot be distinguished, the drake
Carolina's warning call is very clearly recognized by its cut-off
brevity.
G. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.
i. Inciting .
This takes place in the manner typical of surface-feeding ducks,
over the shoulder. Between the separate inciting movements the female

makes caressing movements with her bill towards the drake, especially
towards his breast. Mandarin ducks do this in the same manner. On
the other hand, the female Brazilian Teal, Amazonetta brasiliensis, has
a very peculiar inciting behaviour which may perhaps be regarded as
derived from the one just described. She first threatens the " enemy "
with her neck stretched forward, with her upper mandible raised and
her bill open, then turns her head towards her male and performs
the typical inciting movement, accompanied by a rasping note, in
his direction. Between the inciting movements the female Carolina
often moves her head as if aiming which, as in the Carininae, has the
significance of a very general excitement gesture.

<bodyText confidence="0.9857555" page_id="56291783"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
This is not a very loud sound. It is difficult to represent in letters

nod-swimming of the Mallard and Chestnut-breasted Teal, i.e. to
stir the drake up to the courtship display.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997653772727273" page_id="56291783"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
This is a peculiarly loud " u-ih " corresponding to a long drawn-
out and gradually dying call-note. It sounds peculiarly like an owl.
No one who did not know it would ever ascribe it to a duck. It is
heard especially towards evening and when Wood Ducks fly in over
decoys. As lonely ducks are very prone to utter it, it doubtlessly
has the additional significance of a decrescendo call. I did not,
however, at the time of the first publication of this paper, believe that
this note was phylogenetically comparable to the decrescendo call
of the Anatinae proper. Better knowledge, acquired but lately at the
Severn Wildfowl Trust, has made me change that opinion : the
female of the Maned Goose Chenonetta jubata , has a decrescendo call
which, while quite indubitably homologous to that of the Anatinae,
at the same time is so similar to the " owl-note 55 of the female Carolina
that it represents an exact intermedium between both. Chenonetta
is, in spite of its goose-like bill, a close relation of Lampronessa and Aix,
but in some details of its courtship it shows a closer resemblance to the
Anatinae than both of them do. Thus it is not so astonishing that its
decrescendo call forms a connecting link between that of Lampronessa
and that of Anatinae. An interesting difference lies in the fact that the
" owl-note 55 of the female Carolina also denotes the duck's intention
of flying away herself which the common decrescendo call of surface
feeding ducks certainly does not.

swim after their unwilling mates in this position for some minutes.
On his part the drake shows his intention to mate by repeated drinking
and aiming head movements, sometimes even interspersed with mock-
preening. The Mergansers, which in Delacour's opinion are closely
related to the Carolina-Mandarin group, have almost the same prelude
to mating.

The drake Carolina woos one particular female more than any
male of the Anatinae that I know. While the courtship of the Gadwall
and Wigeon, with their threatening and annoying of other pairs,
reminds one of the courtship of the Anserinae and Casarcinae, the display
of Lampronessa reminds one very much of the display of pheasants,
in which the male continually reveals his striking plumage differentia-
tion before the female. There is not the least tendency of the drakes
to unite in a social display, which is all the more interesting and
striking because this minimum of social play in Lampronessa is in direct
contrast to a maximum of social play on the part of the closely related
Aix. The number of different, though for the most part not highly
differentiated, behaviour patterns in the drake Carolina is striking.
Perhaps this is a primitive condition.

2. The Introductory Shaking.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9825773" page_id="56291784"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
This occurs not very often and only in one particular situation.
That is, when the drake, while in a state of " lazy " restfulness and of
" low motivation 55 concerning courtship activities, finds himself
suddenly confronted by his female. The rising of " courtship mood 55
finds its expression in a repeated shaking of the head exactly similar to
the initial shake of Anatinae. Very frequently it is combined with
drinking.
3. Mock-Preening.
This regularly follows drinking, especially at a high reaction-
intensity. As with Aix it never occurs without the preceding drinking.
However, in Lampronessa , in contrast to Aix, there is drinking in
moments of lesser intensity but this is not followed by mock-preening.
In mock-preening the drake Carolina reaches deep behind his wing.
As rapid as the movement is I have a clear impression that he touches
and moves one particular feather on the underside of the wing, which
Heinroth calls the " brass-feather ". Because of their extraordinarily
short time of reaction birds have a great number of optically-effective
releasers whose exposure is too brief for human observation. One
thinks of the Mallard drake's fountain already described, which was
revealed to us only through the short exposure time of the camera.

<bodyText confidence="0.968339391304348" page_id="56291785"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
This is rather rare in. the drake Carolina. It is doubtless homo-
logous to that of the Anatinae and the Mandarin drake. The accom-
panying sound, a whistling-sneezing " Pfit" sounds very different
from the long drawn-out "Pfrrruiib" of the Mandarin. The
movement of the hood, which is seen
particularly in this movement, is the
same in both species. The edge of the
" disk set ", already mentioned, pro-
trudes sharply, while the feathers of the
back of the head, which are partly white
and elongated, form a long veil, giving
the bird its German name (bride duck)
(Fig. 46).

effective visually because of
white lines on the edge of
the forehead and through the
lengthening of the feathers.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938422592592593" page_id="56291785"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
This is homologous to that of the
Anatinae only because it has certainly
arisen from a drinking through mimic-
exaggeration. After the bill has been
briefly tipped downward it is thrust up
almost to a vertical position, during which the drake utters a short
whistle. A loose connection between this act and that of chin-lifting
shows that both have probably the same origin.
6. Chin-Lifting.
Chin-lifting itself is connected with the turning of the back of
the head (Fig. 47) just as it is in the solicitous Mallard drake. With
the drake Carolina, too, the plumage on the back of the head is laid
flat so that the surface turned to the duck shines, not like the Pintail
and the Gadwall drakes, or in the Mallard's second turning, where it
is striking because of its lustreless black. Something else happens with
the drake Carolina's head feathers, in that the hood is not only depressed
tightly against the neck, but at the same time it is spread to the side
so that the surface turned toward the female is considerably widened
and appears shiny green edged with white (Fig. 47). This turning
of the back of the head is one of the most frequent of the drake's
display acts, and in it the drake is almost constantly showing solicitude
for his duck. At the same time, a second plumage differentiation comes
into play. The drake, swimming before his duck, turning the back of
his head to her and constantly uttering the short "jiib . . . j i i b
. . .jiib", turns his tail sideways toward her. The tail is held
high so that the deep purple-violet side, with the orange-red plumes
in the shape of a sickle hanging to it, is also turned to the duck, as

is the spread-out back of the hood (Fig. 47). With the drake Carolina
every little detail of a plumage so rich in special differentiations
is used, so to speak, in a special ceremony effective optically as a
" visual adaptation 55 in the Suffert sense, or " releaser " in the
Lorenz sense. As the drake cannot turn his tail at right angles while
he is turning the back of his head and showing the side of his tail,
he swims in front of the duck quite obliquely " from the shoulder "

lifting, and a slanting position of the tail. The white-edged surface of the " bride's
veil " as well as the violet side-surface of the base of the tail, ornamented with
orange-yellow down, are turned toward the duck courted, so that they are directly
in her line of vision.
into the duck's line of vision. He often changes from right to left
and left to right. Each time the tail shifts from one side to the other.
7. The Whistle-Shaking.
I purposely do not designate this action as a grunt-whistle because
I believe it is homologous to that only in so far as both arise from the
introductory shaking. On the other hand this very behaviour of the
drake Carolina, because it is far nearer the original form of shaking
than is the grunt-whistle of the Anatinae, is to me the most convincing
evidence of the correctness of our view concerning the phylogenetic
derivation of the latter. In the Carolina, even the completely
autochthonous, mechanically effective shaking begins with a lowering
of the head almost to the breast, so that the upward thrust which
follows reminds one of the grunt-whistle movement of the Anatinae,
just like the " display-shaking " of the male Tadorna tadorna. The
" whistle-shaking " of the drake Carolina compared to the " true "
shaking of the duck is only slightly, although noticeably, mimic-
exaggerated, but in combination with the linkage to an introductory
shaking, the fact that the drake utters a whistle exactly at the right
place makes up a continuous chain of evidence for the theory that the

grunt-whistle of the Anatinae has come from a similar shaking. The
whistle-shaking of the drake Carolina is comparatively rare,
8. Male Inciting.
The drake Carolina is the only male among the Anatinae I know
that has a symbolic threatening behaviour completely like the inciting
behaviour of the female. Especially when he is being incited by the
duck, and clearly as an answer to her the drake thrusts his head over his
shoulder sideways as though threatening an " enemy At each
thrust he utters a soft " dih

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924682071428571" page_id="56291787"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
This is marked by the fact that the bill is not used as a weapon
of attack. Drakes shoot like a flash over the water beside each other
and hit with the shoulders of the wings without ever seizing the other
with the bill. In Lampronessa this shooting ahead has become
" ritualized " as an independent form of display. The drakes often
shoot up to the duck they are courting in the same way, or shoot
back to her after chasing off another drake. Even old females carry
out this behaviour for their drake. Then both birds shoot along beside
each other like fighting drakes but the next moment the ceremony
changes into the turning of the back of the head and expressions of
good will.
10. The Post-Coital Play.
Not marked by any special behaviour. While the female has already
begun her bathing the male launches forth into intensive acts of

A male and two females of this species were presented to the Trust
by Mr. Herbert Shipman, of Hawaii. Both females laid in 1951, but
owing to the late arrival of the male, the eggs were infertile. The 1952
season has proved more successful.
The first egg was laid on 18th February and four clutches were
completed, totalling 19 eggs. Fourteen were set under Silkie X
Buff-Rock hens, 9 of which were fertile and duly hatched. The
incubation period varied from 29 to 31 days. The last clutch of five
eggs was left under the parent goose, and although she did not desert,
incubation must have been faulty. On the 28th day the eggs were
found to be cold and subsequent examination proved that three
fertile eggs had ceased to develop at an early stage.
An inch of snow covered the sitting boxes when the first goslings
hatched and for four days they were kept in a warm brooder. Although
three were very weak, all nine survived and are now fine healthy
birds.
In addition to grazing, the birds fed well on a mash consisting of
biscuit, fresh egg, and dried milk. Both watercress and milk thistle
were supplied, the former being eaten in large quantities.

<bodyText confidence="0.999425136363636" page_id="56291788"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
A pair of these birds laid one infertile egg in 1950 and commenced
nesting in 1951, but were driven from their territory by a Grey Lag
Goose.
In 1952 nest building started during the second week in January
and in all, three nests were constructed. Both birds built, the male
playing the greater part. The first egg was laid on 16th March and
the clutch of four completed by the 21st. The female was at first
allowed to incubate and during this period one egg disappeared.
Meanwhile the male was particularly aggressive to other occupants
of the pond and it was decided to remove the remaining three eggs
which were transferred to a broody Silkie. One of these proved to be
infertile and one addled, while the third hatched successfully on the
35th day.
The downy pattern of the young bird superficially resembled that
of a Sheld-Duck, but with the characteristic head markings of a Tree
duckling.
After fourteen days the " cygnet's 55 legs appeared to be under-
developed and rachitic, and a course of calcium lactate and para-
thyroid extract was administered. The bird duly recovered and
feathering was complete in three months.
Apart from the usual duckling mash, plenty of duckweed was
supplied, together with a daily helping of dried ants' eggs.

I recently obtained a fine pair of Hawk-headed Parrots, but un-
fortunately lost the male--I believe. It was a great pity as I had hoped
to try my hand at breeding them later on. I also received nine Quaker
Parrakeets, apparently a very small subspecies, which I shall try to
breed in the pheasantry next year.
Other new arrivals are a pair of Rock Pebblers, two pairs of Red-
faced Lovebirds, an imported Bourke cock (I now have two pairs),
five Bichenow Finches, and a pair of Quail Finches.
It has really been a very poor breeding season. About twenty
Fischer's and three Peach-faced Lovebirds bred in the pheasantry.
Abyssinians were sitting on two eggs on 1st December, but as it was
very cold I had to take them inside.
For some reason it has been a Zebra Finch year. I have never been
so successful with them. I have bred many normals, whites, fawns, and
cinnamons. The only ones which refused were two pairs of a new
mutation, with pure white underside, and without zebra markings.
Last year I had a pair from Raymaekers and got two youngsters (a
pair) from them, and of the same colour. This year neither pair did
anything. A cock paired to a white hen gave me three cocks, normal-
coloured. I bred lots of Indian Silverbills, and about ten Modest
Finches (Plumheads) ; also some Cordon Bleus and Avadavats.
I have a very reliable strain of Painted Quail, and reared seven
young from two pairs. I have not bred any birds of prey this year.
As to parrot records, one of my friends in Denmark, H. Carlsson,
bred one Abyssinian Lovebird : and with another friend, W. Lang-
berg, one of the most experienced aviculturists in Denmark, a pair of

Sunbirds in the collection.
Another bird new to the collection is the Scarlet-bellied Senegal
Parrot ( Poicephalus senegalus versteri ) presented by Mr. Prestwich. The
Red-vented Parrot is another name for this bird, but neither is really
appropriate, the relevant area being a deep orange rather than red,
but the Orange-bellied of Bannerman is P. s. mesotypus, an intermediate
form. A good coloured plate of P. senegalus and P. s. versteri is to be
found in Bannerman's Birds of Tropical West Africa , vol ii, plate 15.
A pair of Razor-billed Curassows (Mitu mitu) have been presented
by the Antwerp Zoo ; a pair of Indian Green-winged Doves ( Chaleo -

received in exchange.

the worst cannibals I know. They are in a very large aviary where
there are, or rather were, many other birds, doves and pheasants, etc.,
until last night. I had been finding numerous birds and pheasants
just in pieces as if attacked by a swarm of rats, nothing left except
feathers. I had put all this down to vermin which I had failed to
locate. But last night I caught them with a Tambourine Dove. They
actually ate all the flesh and carried all the bones to their nest where
they broke them up. On further examination of the nest I was horrified
to see what those parrakeets had done. The nest was literally crammed
with bones, finely broken up and cleaned as no animal would."

his book, King Solomon&amp;apos;s Ring , is one that everyone interested in natural
history will wish to possess. It is an account of his observations,
adventures, and experiments with his many animal companions, both
pets and in the wild, at his home at Altenberg, near Vienna, and
contains much information on animal psychology of great value, his
observations on birds being of particular interest. In the chapter
" Pitying animals " Dr. Lorenz stresses that sympathy for animals in
captivity is in most cases entirely wasted but some aviculturists may
not agree with his contention that Parrots and Cockatoos are unhappy
prisoners in cages.
The book is written with that inimitable humour typical of Lorenz,
which has in no way been lost by the translation, and is a delight to
read. The many pen-and-ink sketches by the author with which the
text is interspersed add greatly to its charm.

ENJOYING THE COUNTRY. By E. Fitch Daglish. Messrs.
Faber and Faber, London, 1952. Price 18s. net.
Mr. Fitch Daglish opens his book with a chapter on the best means
of enjoying the countryside and what to do and what not to do to get
the fullest enjoyment. He then takes his readers through the seasons
of the year, giving much information and telling them in a clear and
interesting manner what they should look for. As he says in his first
chapter, in nature's year it is difficult to know where to start as
January brings no significant change in the lives of our wild animals
or plants. He comes to the conclusion that it seems rational to think
of nature's year, like the farming year, as beginning with autumn and
as reaching its finale in late summer. He therefore begins with bird
movements in autumn, followed by " autumn colour ", and &lt;c spider
time " and continues through the seasons to high summer. There is
much about birds in the book, in fact they claim the major part of the
author's attention. The black and white illustrations are of the usual
high standard expected from Mr. Fitch Daglish.

Breeding Blue Masked Lovebirds 1952
At the beginning of the season I had in my possession two pairs of Blue-bred
Masked, two pairs of Blue Masked which I imported from the Continent in July,
1951, and one pair of Blues which I bred from a Blue-bred pair in 1951.
The Blue-breds consisted of one 1949 bred pair and one 1950 pair. The 1949 pair
produced one Blue and one normal from the first nest. A second nest consisting of
two Blues and two normals contracted some complaint, possibly coccidiosis, at about
ten days and passed out. A third nest of fertile eggs failed to hatch out.
The 1951 pair of Blues, which turned out to be a true pair (brother and sister) had
one nest of clear eggs and made no more attempts at breeding. I hope for better
results next year from this pair as they are a fine, large, and vigorous pair of a size
equal to imported normal Masked.
One of the imported Blue pairs went to nest and laid the first egg on 8th June,
producing five eggs all of which proved to be fertile. The first egg hatched on 1st July
and three others followed. A budgie nest-box was used with a layer of sawdust on the
bottom and no moisture devices resorted to. Four strong birds were reared which
are now hardly distinguishable from their parents and all are of a size equal to wild
specimens. The old pair did not go to nest again until October and laid the first egg
on 5th October, producing five eggs, all of which proved to be fertile. The first egg
hatched on 29th October and two more followed, the last two eggs failing to hatch.
Three strong birds are now commencing to fly and have withstood the recent cold
spell in an outdoor aviary.
The second pair of Continental Blues have so far failed to breed but I am still
hoping they will do so next year.
To sum up, I have bred eight Blues this year which together with my six Blues at
the beginning of the season makes my total of Blues fourteen and puts me in a strong
position for next season. At the same time I also have two blue-bred pairs. Inciden-
tally, I find the Blues hardier, if anything, than the normals.

The National Show
The National Show continues to expand, the foreign exhibits this year approached
the 400 mark, requiring the services of four judges. It was organized in conjunction
with the Poultry Show, and entries to both sections were complementary to each
other. No doubt many visitors found this a very acceptable arrangement.
There was a notable increase in the number of " Trade Exhibitors ", which
indicates that there is a growing realization of the importance of this Show as an
annual venue of all bird lovers. As usual the organization worked with general
efficiency. The only criticism overheard was with regard to the lighting during
the evening in the gallery where the foreign section was situated. During the day,
however, there was no justification for any dissatisfaction on this point.
With the removal of the ban on the importation of Parrots, a greater number
and variety of these birds was expected, but it takes time to convert newly imported
birds into show specimens of national standard, and now that the ban is to be
reimposed, this anticipated increase may never materialize. There was a large
entry in Lovebirds, an excellent pair of Abyssinian taking first place ; other species
represented were Red-faced, Fischer's, Masked, and Peach-face. Several good
exhibits were entered in the classes for Australian and Asiatic Parrakeets, a few
South American specimens were also on view after many years' absence, but only
one pair of Australian Grass Parrakeets--Elegants--put in an appearance. The
class for Lories and Lorikeets was interesting, as it contained Mr. Williams' pair of
Yellow-backed Lories, awarded best Parrot-like, also a pair of Musshenbroek's
Lorikeets, probably the first ever benched, also an Ornate, a Forster's, and a pair of
Swainson's. Other notable entries were Mr. Sawyer's Salmon-crested Cockatoo and
a fine hybrid Macaw militaris X ararauna, and also a hybrid Pennant's X Goldmantled-
Rosella.
The entry of small seed-eaters was enormous, several classes containing some thirty
contestants. The quality throughout was good, the margin of difference between
first and last being narrow. Among the most interesting were Mr. Sawyer's Green
Twin-spots, best seed-eater--an outstanding Pin-tailed Nonpareil, a nice pair of
Jackson's Wydah, several of the rarer Waxbills, Violet-eared, Dufresne's, and Black-
cheeked.

The opening class among softbills was indeed exceptional, there being no less
than 15 entries of Sunbirds and Humming Birds. Mr. Sawyer's Ruby and Topaz
taking first prize, also the best foreign exhibit and supreme champion of the Show.
Not content with that, Mr. Sawyer also took second and third prize in this class,
with a pair of Amethyst Sunbirds, and a pair of Pucheran's Emerald Humming Birds.
He repeated the performance in the next class, for small Tanagers and Sugar Birds,
with a team of Black-headed, Yellow-winged, and Blue Sugar Birds. All these exhibits
were faultlessly staged in most tastefully decorated surroundings.
One or two less common Tanagers, absent for many years, put in an appearance
once more. There were also some beautiful Robin Chats, Starlings, and Thrushes,
several Toucans and Touracos. No less than four Wilson's Birds of Paradise and
a pair of Twelve-wired, Fairy Bluebirds, Pittas and Manakins, besides many other
interesting exhibits too numerous to mention. Altogether a most excellent exhibition.

Few, if any, books supply details regarding this. I am indebted to our member,
Mr. Tom Goodwin of Ripley, for informing me that when he was collecting in New
Caledonia in 1937 that a local French farmer accompanied him to show him where
they nested. On approaching the spot he was shown a dozen or more nests, some
with young in them. To his surprise they were situated in holes and crevices among
rocks and quite near each other. Incidentally, he made an examination of the trees
in the vicinity which were numerous but only three to four inches in diameter and
perfectly sound. In a wild state these birds apparently nest in small colonies.

RISKS INVOLVED IN REMOVAL OF NESTING-BOX OF TURQUOISINE
PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984639166666667" page_id="56291795"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
The Duke of Bedford has the welfare of Grass Parrakeets so much at heart that I am
surprised he should advise people not to let Turquoisines have three nests in succes-
sion, without first giving his readers some word of warning as to the grave risk of
injury to the newly-fledged second brood if any attempt is made to remove the nest-
box before the third clutch is just on the point of hatching.
The reason for this is that, unlike newly-fledged budgerigars--who just sit and look
at you while you remove the nest box--newly-fledged Turquoisines are quite the
wildest things imaginable, and remain so for at least a fortnight, with the result that
if you are foolish enough to enter their aviary during this period you will be lucky
indeed if they sustain no more serious injury than bleeding ceres and broken tail-
feathers. Furthermore, by the time it is safe to enter the aviary and remove the nest
box the hen will have been incubating her third clutch for more than a fortnight, as
hen Turquoisines usually lay and start to sit several days before the youngest member
of the previous brood leaves the nest. Incidentally I may say that I have on more than
one occasion discussed with the Duke this problem of preventing a hen Turquoisine
going to nest for a third time in succession, but he had no solution to offer.
For those who, like myself, find themselves quite incapable of light-heartedly
throwing away clutches of just-hatching Turquoisine eggs, and finally decide to leave
their mother to hatch and rear them, I have, I am glad to say, a grain of comfort to
offset the Duke's gloomy prognostication as to the dire results of such folly.
We have a hen Turquoisine at Keston who insists upon going to nest three times
each season, and during the past few years has reared a large number of most excellent
young ones. According to the Duke's theory this bird should certainly have died of
exhaustion by now, yet, strange to say, she remains in what can only be described as
rude health to this day. I touch wood as I write this, because, of course, she may
suddenly get ill and die to-morrow ; but this, as we all know, is liable to happen to
any of one's birds, quite irrespective of the size or number of the broods they may,
or may not, have reared in the past.

THE CAPERCAILLIE IN CAPTIVITY

By S. H. Benson, Director-Secretary, Zoological Society of Glasgow
and West of Scotland (Glasgow, Scotland)
When a poultry farmer in the County of Angus, Scotland, phoned
me to say that he had trapped a Capercaillie cock bird (Tetrao uro-
gallus), and that he wished to present it to our Gardens, I accepted his
kind offer with some misgivings. It was in the last week of September,
1950, and the prospects of being able to provide an adequate supply of
coniferous feeding throughout the winter were not good.
Although there are many areas of conifer woodland in Scotland,
they are not convenient to the City of Glasgow, where our Gardens
are situated. I was able, however, to have branches of pine and fir
sent in for the first five weeks, and although the bird picked at them,
one could not say that it tackled them with avidity, or showed as
much preference as it did for the Indian corn (maize) and whole oats
supplied by us, or the herbage and insects it got in the i |acre wood
with thirty deciduous trees.
However, let us first of all consider the psychological attitude of this
bird--very difficult to keep in captivity--in a strange and confined
environment. In the wood were peafowl, guineafowl, wallaby,
Egyptian Geese, Blue Snow Geese and Grey Lag. The Capercaillie
moved about in an aloof attitude, at times aggressive. Its one ambition
seemed to be to escape ; one could not say that it was resigned to
confinement.
Its attitude to visitors is one of expediency, and in competition with
the other birds it gets a major share of tit-bits ; I have noticed a very
marked preference for potato crisps ! Biscuit and bread are also eaten
with relish.
In the winter, when it was thought that the Capercaillie could not
live without pine needles, the bird managed finely with the food
provided by us, even though it was deprived of herbage through frost
and snow.

S. H. BENSON-THE CAPERCAILLIE IN CAPTIVITY
Following a letter I wrote to The Field on the subject of our unique
Capercaillie, some rather interesting information followed in the
columns of that publication. One writer said that it is evident that
young Capercaillie, reared in Scotland, in the wild state, can get no
pine needles until they are able to fly up to the tree tops. He knew
of young Capercaillie broods going into fields of-growing oats long
before oats were ripe, and remaining there, feeding on oats and
weed seeds, until the corn was cut. But this writer asserted that pine
shoots form their winter reserve of food. Nobody doubts this under
natural conditions, but our experience proves that the bird can live
without coniferous food in the winter.
Dr. Ian D. Pennie, who has investigated the history and distribu-
tion of the Capercaillie in Scotland, mentions its reduction in its
colonisation areas and its extinction in others, due to widespread
felling of conifers caused by two world wars. There is evidence of
changes in the Capercaillie habits. Younger plantations are now
frequented and birds regularly visit stubbles to feed.
It now seems that we are witnessing a unique change in the habits
of the Capercaillie ; a change which may have advanced somewhat
farther than we realize. We may well assume that our success in
keeping one so long is in some measure due to its being a product
of the " new race ".
Let us now consider the exhibition of a Capercaillie in a
Zoological Garden where the great majority of visitors expect to see
striking and exciting specimens. To many, the lonely, ungainly and
somewhat unusual bird is interesting. Some think it is a bird of prey.
However, the fact that it begs so successfully in face of competition
assures the Capercaillie of an admiring audience.
In May, 1952, we were able to observe the display of the Caper-
caillie. It is a most impressive performance, and I think it is something
that few can claim to have seen in the wild state. The neck is stretched
and the tail is fanned vertically in a way that suggests the Turkey's
nuptial performance ; wings are drooped and the bird struts about
in a most hostile manner. Its aggressive attitude is no idle threat, for
I have seen it attack our Peacocks and even advance on the keeper
when he went into the wood.
The exhibition is not confined to action, and there is an unpleasant
vocal accompaniment more suited to a mammal. The prelude to
attack is a very clear click, and this call is repeated at frequent intervals.
We have been trying to get a hen to keep our bird company but so far
have been unsuccessful.
So far as I am aware our keeping of a Capercaillie so long (in a
zoological garden) is a record, but it is not by any means a record
for keeping them in captivity anywhere. I am most reliably informed
that they have not only been kept for a number of years in Sweden,

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
It is not often that a Parrot-like bird dies in one's collection of
genuine old age. If the management is good it is, indeed, the owner
who may first succumb to that universal malady !
This summer I have, however, lost two cock Roseate Cockatoos
from this cause, but there was rather a remarkable difference in the
manner of their going. One, tame and a talker, I acquired a few
years ago from the Zoo, where he had doubtless been a number of
years, probably after a similar, or longer, period in other hands.
He was at first wing-stiff from long caging, but soon recovered the
power of flight and he bred a few weeks later, and continued to
breed until this season, when he had no mate.
He remained in good spirits and perfect plumage until a few weeks
ago, when he began to spend an abnormal amount of time in the
shelter and did not seem as active as usual. His appetite remained
good, and he brightened up a bit in the high temperature of the
hospital, readily greeting his friends with conversation, but he never
got really right, and died before he seemed well enough to turn out
again.
The other cock--a non-albino white--I obtained, with an albino
hen, about 25 years ago. For some seasons they bred, producing
always grey young, but they stopped doing so about sixteen years ago.
The cock began very slowly to show signs of age. When I brought
my birds to Woburn I decided to fly him at liberty in the hope ot
rejuvenating him. Complete liberty sometimes has a marvellously
rejuvenating effect on birds that have aged prematurely owing to
close confinement in a cage, but it did not make much difference to
the old Roseate, doubtless because he had long been living in an
aviary which allowed a decent amount of exercise. He behaved
sensibly, and stayed round the aviaries, but never flew about very
much. He also became slowly more feeble and after my aviary
attendant had found him one day on the ground, and unable to make
his way home, I decided that he would have to end his days in an
aviary. The way he hung on to life, not only for months, but even for
years, was, however, extraordinary. His plumage became very
abnormal, his once-white wings growing more and more pink. He
also never had a proper moult, but always had some feathers in quill.

Most of his time he spent sleeping, but the weather did not seem to
trouble him, and he would often sit, by choice, in cold, drenching
rain, when a cosy shelter was available. His companion at this time
was a hen Malabar Parrakeet for whom I have never been able to
secure a mate. I thought they would agree together as she would
be too small to hurt him, and he would be too decrepit to hurt her.
They not only agreed, but formed an attachment for one another--
the strangest, most amusing, and most pathetic I have ever known
among birds. "Amor omnia vincit " was certainly true in their case.
There were differences in size, the Cockatoo being about four times
as big as the Parrakeet. Their language was wholly different. Their
courtship technique was wholly different. A courting Roseate preens
his feathers as an invitation to his lady-love to return the compliment,
and also to allow him to preen hers ; but he does not feed her. A
courting Malabar does not preen his lady's feathers, but he does
feed her. That the Malabar should have made advances to the
Roseate in spite of these difficulties was not so very strange, as lonely
spinsters, with or without feathers, do sometimes try and make the best
of very unpromising material ! What was extraordinary was that the
poor old Cockatoo, with one foot in the grave, and not within a
hundred miles of any capacity to be in breeding condition, not only
understood the Malabar's affectionate intentions, but appreciated
and was flattered by them, trying bravely "to be young for her
sake " ! When she made advances to him he would perk up and
make nibbling movements with his beak, as Roseates do when feeling
friendly. He would also start preening and she, partly understanding
what was required of her even though it was not at all what the
instinct of her species taught her, would pull his feathers in a clumsy
but gentle fashion, an attention which pleased him very much.
The sad time at last came, however, when it seemed kinder to have
the old man put to sleep as, if he fell off the perch, as he sometimes
did, he was only able to regain it with great difficulty.

NOTES ON THE GREEN GLOSSY STARLING
(Lamprocolius chalybeus )
By Betty Adamson (Slough, Bucks, England)
Glossy Starlings have appealed to me ever since I first saw them at

the Zoo as a child, but I did not keep any myself until May, 1951,
when I was given a Purple Starling, Lamprocolius purpureus , and subse-
quently purchased an orange-eyed Green Glossy Starling, of whose
specific name I was not sure, as a companion for it. There was no
sign of pairing between them during the summer, as I half hoped
there might be, and later behaviour showed them both to be males.

In November, I acquired another pair of green Starlings, slightly
larger and with yellow eyes. Derek Goodwin has examined and
compared notes on the plumage of the three green Starlings with skins
at the Natural History Museum and has come to the conclusion
that they are all the same species, Lamprocolius chalybeus , and that the
orange eye colour is an individual or local difference, although the
books give " yellow " as the eye colour for all races of L. chalybeus.
The first owner of the yellow-eyed birds did not know if they were
a true pair, and certainly there were no external differences except
that one had a permanently ruffled patch of feathers on the breast
and was, perhaps, a fraction smaller. They were in very good
condition, so I introduced them straight away into an aviary 15 feet
by 22 feet, with a shelter 8 feet square, whose other inhabitants were
the Starlings mentioned previously, a pair of Blackbirds, several
British finches, a pair of Barbary Doves, and a pair of Budgerigars.
They all agreed quite well together during the winter, although the
green pair speedily established superiority over the other insectivorous
birds, they did not molest them unduly. By March, however, they
were becoming decidedly aggressive, and harried the Purple Starling
in a disturbing manner, but did not take so much notice of the orange-
eyed Starling or the Blackbirds. After one particularly bad scuffle
I decided to put them in an adjoining aviary occupied solely by a
hen Jackdaw. This aviary was only 6 feet wide by 14 feet long, plus
a shelter 5 feet by 8 feet.
Inside the shelter I nailed up a budgerigar nest-box, with the door
at the front left open, and both birds showed interest in it but made
no attempt to carry nesting material. I had seen the cock offering
mealworms to the hen, who accepted and ate them, although occasion-
ally she would return the mealworm to the cock and it would pass
between them several times before she ate it. They had also tugged
at string securing the perches, as if with nest-building intentions.
On 1st May I nailed up a parrakeet style nest-box, 8 inches square
and 12 inches deep. By the next evening a heap of twigs and dried
grass had been added. On 3rd May I provided two old sparrow
nests, dried leaves and more twigs and saw the female carrying
feathers and string to the nest, but she made no attempt to enter while
I was present. I did not see the cock carrying any material.
By this time the Jackdaw was very wary of the Starlings and they
would not allow her into the shelter to feed. On 5th May I came
home in the evening just in time to rescue her from what, I think, would
have been certain death, as she was lying on her back on the ground
shrieking with fear, with both Starlings pecking at her fiercely, and so
engrossed were they in their murderous task that I had to go right
inside the aviary to chase them off.
Left to themselves the Starlings spent a lot of time displaying to

each other and the cock would go into aggressive display against the
Starlings in the other aviary whenever they approached the dividing
netting. There are two common postures which seem to merit full
description since they do not appear to have been previously described.
(1) The threat-display .--When threatening a rival the male bird
holds himself erect, with head stretched upwards and the wings held
so that the secondary feathers, with their dark velvety spots, are
somewhat spread and fully exhibited in a lateral plane. In this
posture the wings (without being opened) are constantly moved
with a quick, upward-fickling movement and the irides rapidly
contract and dilate.
(2) The greeting-display .--When one of the paired Starlings is
approached by its mate it often greets it by lowering its head and
uttering a note rather similar to, and undoubtedly derived from, the
begging-note of the juvenile. This would appear to be in the nature
of a friendly greeting and, like so many displays signifying friendliness
or submissive ness, it is very obviously the " opposite " of the hostile
threat-display.

display" posture.

On 12th May, having seen no evidence of nest building for three
days, I provided fresh moss and dried grass, but this was not used,
although a few blades of fresh green grass were added. The next
day I threw down some small bits of cotton wool which both cock
and hen collected and took into the nest. Early in the morning of the
following day (14th May) I put in a handful of white and brown duck

and pigeon feathers which were pounced upon by both birds with
much chattering and obvious excitement. By evening the nest was
well lined with feathers, and the hen roosted in the nest box for the
first time.
On 15th May the hen laid a soft-shelled egg at midday, so I
immediately supplied plenty of crushed cuttle-bone and egg-shell.
She roosted in the nest-box again that night, but on the following
three nights slept on a perch beside the cock. The next three nights
she spent in the nest-box and on 22 nd May I found an egg, a delicate
shade of turquoise-blue mottled with irregular brown splotches. Three
more eggs were laid on successive days, all before 1.30 p.m., and one
definitely before 10 a.m., but the hen did not commence to sit tightly
until the fourth egg was laid.
The cock took no part in incubating the eggs. The hen would
come off the nest whenever I appeared--regularly at 8.30 a.m.,
1 p.m., and several times after 6 p.m.--in order to claim her share of
mealworms. Indeed, if no mealworms were forthcoming she seemed
not at all anxious to return. By now both birds were entirely insec-
tivorous, ignoring their usual food which I continued to offer fresh
daily, and eating very little fruit. If the hen spent too long off the
nest--and towards the end of the incubation period I had time to
notice that she frequently spent spells of five to ten minutes away--the
cock became very worried and would stretch out his head and neck
and run towards her, chattering at the same time, as if trying to
persuade her to return to the nest.
On 5th June, exactly fourteen days after the first egg had been
laid, one egg hatched, and the chick could be heard squeaking faintly,
by 8 a.m. The second hatched between 1 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. the
same day ; the third before 7 a.m. on 6th June, and the fourth between
that time and 7 a.m. 7th June. I looked at the nest once every day
in the early morning, when the hen's attention was occupied by
mealworms ; the young gaped strongly as soon as the lid of the nest
box was raised, but I resisted the temptation to handle them. Six
days after hatching all four appeared very healthy and there was
nothing to choose between them in size ; quill ridges were visible
under the wing flesh. The female was still feeding them on maggots,
and had now commenced to feed large mealworms, ignoring the
smaller mealworms and Triholium destructor larvae with which she had
been supplied at first. By this time I had put down for this one pair
of birds and their four young, about 6,000 Tribolium destructor larvae,
2 lb. of mealworms (about 7,000), and 3,500 blow-fly larvae. This
seems a staggering amount, but I have under- rather than over-
estimated the numbers. Some of the insects were wasted, as I found
the hen much keener on picking up insects off the ground than
sorting them out of a bowl and so, although the bowls of mealworms

and maggots were always present, five or six times a day I threw down
a handful of mixed larvae, quite a few of which no doubt escaped.
The hen was a very enthusiastic feeder, often gathering a dozen
maggots or mealworms in her bill at once, but the cock did not feel
the call of parental duty very strongly, and would visit the young
only occasionally, and then only with one mealworm. He would,
however, visit the hen when she was sitting on the eggs or brooding
the young, and give her much vocal encouragement.
The seventeenth night after the young had hatched was the last
night the hen roosted in the nest box ; from then onward she slept
on a perch beside the cock. The young looked ready to leave the
nest, with their flight feathers well grown and tail feathers about an
inch long. I now began to feed a lot of mealworm pupae as well as
large larvae and both birds showed a strong preference for feeding
their offspring on the pupae, and maggots were taken very seldom.
They began to use a harsh, rasping call that I had never heard before,
particularly in the early morning and at dusk. By 27th June, twenty-
two days after hatching, I was becoming worried as the young were
showing no interest in the outside world and their parents were
cutting down on food supplies, presumably in an attempt to entice the
young birds out. Also the weather had become intolerably hot and
the temperature inside the box was well over ioo* F. For the
first time I handled the young and found three quite big and strong
but one very thin and weak. At midday I hand-fed them on bread
and milk. At 6 p.m. one young bird was out of the nest and was able
to fly a little. He roosted that night on a low perch. The next day
was even hotter and I found the weakest Starling dead. I removed
the other two from the box and placed them on the shelter floor where
they ran around quite actively but were unable to fly ; by night,
however, they had managed to flutter on to a low perch.
The hen appeared to do all the feeding but often received no
response from the young birds. She would lightly tap the beak, and
if the bird did not gape immediately, tap its legs gently. If there was
still no response, she would go to another bird and repeat the per-
formance, but if, as seemed to happen very often, none of the young
would accept the insects in her bill, she would follow them round in
a very agitated manner.
By the evening of the next day one bird was very weak, and kept
falling on to its side, so I brought it into the house and gave it a dose
of brandy and water--a " cure all 55 for bird complaints, in my opinion.
The weather was still extremely hot and the next day, three days after
leaving the nest, the lustiest youngster--which had left the nest of its
own accord and had begun to fly quite strongly--was found in the
evening huddled in a corner on the ground, although at midday it had
appeared perfectly well. That too was brought into the house, given

brandy, and caged with the other which now looked stronger, though
we had to resort to forcible hand-feeding. The remaining bird looked
all right, and roosted beside its father on a high perch.
But alas, next morning the bird we had brought into the house the
previous evening was dead and the one left in the aviary was lying on
the floor. It failed to respond to any treatment and died within
half an hour. The first one to fall sick seemed much brighter but
several times that day had bouts of lying on its side and " breathing
its last ". Each time, however, we managed to revive it with brandy,
and it is now a strong bird, having undergone its first moult during
October.
I sent one of the corpses for a post mortem examination, but owing
to the heat the body was too decomposed for the cause of death to be
ascertained. The pathologist did, however, suggest that the heat
may have had something to do with it, and yet it seems extraordinary
that a bird which comes from a tropical climate should succumb to an
English heat-wave.
The parent birds continued to visit the nest-box and to add bits
of nesting material ; feathers, dried grass, etc., and also fresh green
grass which I saw the cock pull up with his beak. Several times the
cock attempted to mate with the hen when they were picking up
mealworms that I had thrown on the ground, and this was the only
pairing I witnessed. There was a minor domestic drama before the
arrival of the next egg. The orange-eyed Starling in the adjoining
aviary had for some time been " making eyes " at the hen whenever
she left her family, and when once they were gone he redoubled his
efforts to attract her away from her husband. He would run back-
wards and forwards on the ground beside the wire separating them, then
fly to his nest-box, at the same time chattering and calling to her.
She seemed quite ready to follow if only the netting had not been in
the way, and would run along the ground on her side while her
husband pursued her and did his best to get between her and the
other cock. But the purple-headed Starling at no time showed
interest in " the lady next door
On 12th July a soft-shelled egg was laid at noon and the hen roosted
in the nest-box at night. On 15th July I did not look into the nest
box until 6 o'clock in the evening and I then found one egg which
was misshapen, being very elongate and pointed. This egg was
incubated for sixteen days, but failed to hatch.
On 10th August the hen laid again, just one egg, and this hatched
in thirteen days. The young bird thrived and left the nest twenty-three
days after hatching. It was out of the nest by 8 a.m. and scuttling
round the floor when I appeared, but it did not fly for three days,
sleeping on the floor in a corner of the shelter. On the fourth night
it roosted on a low perch and from then on made great progress.

The weather was cold with several sharp frosts at night, but the bird
seemed unperturbed. The survivor of the previous nest, however,
whom I had transferred to a cage in the other aviary shelter, was so
miserable, shivering with puffed-out plumage, that I decided to keep
him in a cage in the house for the winter.
Ten days after her offspring had left the nest it became obvious
that the hen was going to lay again. In feeding the cock had again
played only a small part and whereas the hen would gather a bill full
of mealworms and deliberately seek out the young bird and feed it,
the cock only fed the young bird if it was near him and actually
begging for food. Even then he would pick up only one mealworm
at a time. As the hen lost interest in him, so the young Starling
became weaker ; he sat near the mealworm bowl and asked for food
whenever one of his parents flew down, but they fed him in a per-
functory and unwilling fashion, and although he had begun to examine
food of his own accord and would, I think, have commenced to pick
up satisfactorily in another few days, his increasing weakness made it
difficult for him to balance when trying to pick up a mealworm. On
27th September an egg was in the nest by 12.30 p.m., and the young
bird was so much weaker that I forcibly fed it twice on bread and
milk and mealworms. The following day a second egg was laid by
11 a.m., and I removed the young Starling and caged him with the
other young one who had now commenced to moult and had become
very quiet, but was eating well.
Two days before this next lot of eggs were due to hatch the aviary
roof was repaired and the hen was off the nest for over three hours,
being replaced by a hot-water bottle. I hadn't much hope of the
eggs hatching, as the weather was extremely cold and the hen seemed
to spend even longer intervals away from the nest than she had done
previously, so I was greatly surprised to find a chick in the nest at
8.30 a.m. on nth October. The second chick was just out of the
shell when I looked in the nest at 10.30 a.m. the following day.
This egg shell was not removed until noon, when I saw the cock fly
out carrying half the shell which he proffered to the hen as though
offering a mealworm. She did not take it from him, however, and he
then flew down to the ground and ate some of it. This was the only
time I saw the shell removed and eaten, but as I never found any
traces of the other egg shells, I presume they must all have been
treated in the same way.
The day was overcast and cold, and my joy at the successful hatching
was somewhat tempered by the fact that the hen did not appear to
share my pleasure, and spent very little time with her offspring.
The following evening one had disappeared and the other felt cold,
but was still alive the next morning when I brought it into the house
to try to hand-rear it. Unfortunately I was not successful.

At the time of writing (December) the two young birds that did
survive are spending the winter in a large cage in our kitchen, and
judging by the amount of their " singing " are both cocks. The last-
hatched has only just commenced to warble properly, but for some
weeks has been emitting the most awful, harsh, nerve-racking squawks
in an effort to find his voice. Like budgerigars they appear to be
stimulated by certain noises such as a kettle boiling and food frying.
It is at times quite difficult to make oneself heard.
A brief note on the general feeding of the Starlings may be of
interest. Their staple diet consists of Sluis' Universal food, Rudd's
Anteggo, bread and milk, and fruit, pear being the favourite. A handful
of mealworms or maggots is thrown down twice a day. The birds also
relish scrambled egg, cake crumbs and other odds and ends from the
household table. They were outside all last winter with only slight
heat supplied by an electric tubular heater on the very coldest nights.
This year they have had no heat at all and appear quite fit, although
we have had some extremely cold weather.
The insects offered to the pair when rearing young were all species
that infest various foodstuffs and of which I am able to obtain fairly
large quantities through my work. Larvae of the following species

temperature of 25 0 C. (77 0 F.) will produce large numbers of soft-
bodied white larvae, about 5 mm. long, in two to three weeks. I
imagine they would be extremely suitable for small, delicate, insec-

Lake Myvatn is situated in north-eastern Iceland, some 55 miles by
road from the town of Akureyri and at about 1,000 feet above sea-level.
The lake is indeed a beautiful place in a country of much scenic
grandeur and there can be few comparable places in the world where
waterfowl of thirteen species breed in such numbers or in such a
concentration.
The main reasons for this would seem to be the abundance of food,
the comparative scarcity of natural enemies, and the suitability of the
nesting terrain on the shores, on the islands and about the surrounding
streams. The ducks are never shot but are carefully preserved for the
egg harvest.
All the land around the lake and every island, however small, belongs
to one farm or another, and the ducks' nests are robbed of all but four
eggs, though great care is taken that no bird deserts because of the
belief that it will re-nest on someone else's land. The eggs are a
considerable source of income to the farmers, who must make a return
of the numbers taken to the Inland Revenue authorities for the
purpose of income tax.
Thus it would be impossible to ascertain exactly how many eggs are
taken annually because no doubt the official returns err on the side of
modesty, but it must amount to some thousands.
It might be thought that this egg-collecting must be disastrous for
the birds, but evidently that is not so, for the mortality among the
ducklings is very high, mainly, it would appear, for the reason that
many of them lose sight of their mothers, so that unless they are able
to join on to another family--and most ducklings are, of course, often
hostile to newcomers--they soon perish from the cold. If, therefore,
the mothers are unable to care for four it is unlikely that they would
be appreciably more successful with a normal brood.
Also, of course, the taking of eggs has been going on for many years,
yet it would seem that the area could scarcely support a much greater
population than the present one.
The chief natural enemies are the Raven (Corvus c. corax) and the
Greater Black-backed Gull (.Larus marinus ), neither of them common.
I once saw a pair of these gulls attacking a duck far out on the lake.
The duck was trying to escape by diving, but its course under the very
clear water was easily followed by the gulls which pounced upon it
whenever it came to the surface. At length they caught it and then set
about trying to drown it--and dreadful it was to see the unhappy bird
striving to get its head up for air.

The Ravens sometimes take sitting birds, but the remains of ducks
and their eggs are not a common sight.
I think it is correct to say that the birds of prey (the Iceland Falcon,
Snowy Owl, etc.) which seem to be rare round about the lake, for
I did not see one, and the Arctic Fox, which is shot by the farmers,
feed more on the Ptarmigan than on the ducks. The name Myvatn
means the lake of gnats or midges--and very appropriate the name is,
for these and small flies are present in the summer in many millions.
Mercifully they do not bite, but on a sunny day they swarm in such
clouds that it is sometimes difficult to see where to step. While I was
there in June a 24-hour blizzard killed off many of these insects so that
life for the ensuing week became more agreeable.
These insects with their larvae and pupae must form a large part
of the diet of the birds ; there is also a species of caddis-fly, the larvae
of which are attached to the submerged lava boulders, and some
water-snails.
Reykjahlid on the northern side of the lake is perhaps the best place
for seeing the nesting birds. A mile or so off shore is the pretty island
of Slutness, a favourite nesting place, as is a tip of land on the further
side wherever the ground is carpeted by the dwarf birch with moss
growing up between its foot high twiggy branches.
The lake in this area is no more than five or six feet deep, and here
it seemed that the Long-tailed Duck ( Clangula hyemalis ) was more
common than elsewhere, and at another place a few miles off Barrow's
Golden-eye (. Bucephala islandica) was more plentiful ; another was more
favoured by the Common Scoter ( Melanitta n. nigra) and in another
there seemed to be more Tufted (Ay thy a fuligula) than anywhere else.
The most common duck of all was the Scaup (. Aythya m. marila) and
it may be that these preferences for certain localities is determined by
the nesting terrain rather than by any food factor.
Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus senator ), Wigeon (Anas penelope ),
Pintail (A. a . acuta), Gadwall (A. s. strepera) --said to have become more
common within the past 40 years--Teal (A. c. crecca ), and Mallard
(A. p. platyrhyncha) also nest here.
A certain amount of indiscriminate laying of eggs seems to take place,
single ones being laid far from any nest, and once I found a nest with
nineteen Scaup eggs in it and a Long-tailed Duck stting on four of its
own and four Scoter eggs. Barrow's Golden-eye normally nests in holes
or crevices in the lava rocks but on Slutness one was sitting under the
bushes, the nest being rendered very conspicuous by the heap of pale
grey down. I was shown a cavern with perpendicular sides in which
a Barrow's once nested on a ledge, the young being unable to get out
until rescued by a kindly farmer.
Contrary to the impression conveyed by a drawing of Myvatn in
Millais' British Diving Ducks , the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus h.

histrionicus) is rarely if ever present on the lake itself, but, like the
Goosander ( Mergus m. merganser), inhabits the fast running streams and
rivers, particularly those with islands in them, which flow in or out of
the lake. At one place on the southern side Harlequin Ducks may be
seen from the road. These strikingly handsome birds are tame, allow-
ing one to approach quite near and then not taking flight but swimming
off downstream.
It is strange that they possess such quiet voices, for they must scarcely
be able to hear one another amid the rushing waters of their favourite
nesting places.
Within a few feet of the shore at Reykjahlid were two nests of the
pretty Slavonian Grebe ( Podiceps auritus) and on Slutness in a crevasse
in the lava was a nest of the Iceland Redwing ( Turdus musicus coburni)
with newly hatched young, while in a loose stone wall a White Wagtail
(Motacilla a. alba) had its nest. Here the Red-necked Phalarope
(Phalaropus lobatus) was a common bird and one nest with the husband
dutifully sitting was found. The Arctic Tern {Sterna macrura) is also
common and the nest, always placed in conspicuous position, would yet
be difficult to find because of the coloration of the eggs if the parent
birds did not betray their presence by mobbing the intruder. The
Northern Golden Plover ( Pluvialis apricaria altifrons) is quite common,
small flocks often being accompanied by Dunlins--the form inter-
mediate between Calidris a . alpina and C. a. schinzii * The Faroe Snipe
{Capella gallingo faroeensis) and the Whimbrel {Numenius p. phaeopus) are
sometimes to be seen round about the lake ; also a few Black-headed
Gulls {Larusj. ridibundus).
In rocky places the Snow Buntings {Plectrophenax n. nivalis) were
nesting and the males performing the pretty display flight ; the
Wheatear--intermediate between (Enanthe oe. cenanthe and (E. oe.
leucorrhoa --seemed quite rare, as was the Meadow Pipit {Anthus
pratensis ).
One Red-throated Diver {Colymbus stellatus) was seen and another
heard ; a single specimen of the Kentish Plover {Leucopolius a. alexan-
drinus) was also seen, but perhaps the rarest of the summer visitors to
Myvatn was a single drake American Wigeon ( Anas americana) flying
in company with two females which may or may not have been this
or the Common Wigeon.
In Reykjavik the Mallard is common on the small lakes within the
city and very tame ; the graceful Arctic Tern is also common. On an
island in the bay there is a colony of Eiders, not seen, but presumed to
be Somateria m. mollissima , nesting as elsewhere in artificial nests
provided for the purpose of collecting the down. The journey by road
from Reykjavik to Akureyri (285 miles) is of great interest. Whooper
Swans {Cygnus c. cygnus ), Grey Lag-Geese (Anser a. anser), a few Whim-
brel and Golden Plover, and one or two of the Iceland Redshank

By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
For some years we had a cock Alexandrine Parrakeet mated to a hen
lutino Ringneck, and they produced several broods of rather hand-
some hybrids which were about intermediate in size between their
two parents, and had light biscuit-brown wing-patches instead of the
maroon-red ones of an Alexandrine.
Last year I decided to mate their mother to a cock lutino Ringneck,
and their father to a hen Alexandrine bred by Captain Veitch, and the
latter mating produced a brood of three excellent young Alexandrines.
The cock Alexandrine, however, recently died, and I decided to mate
the hen to one of the male hybrids ; a mating which (if the inheritance
is a sex-linked one) ought to produce a percentage of lutino hen
hybrids which would be three-quarter Alexandrines.
After allowing the Alexandrine hen a decent interval in which to
mourn her late husband, I introduced the male hybrid into her aviary,
which is of our cockatoo type, without an enclosed shelter, but with
the back and third of the top and sides boarded over. The meeting
was, on the hen's part, frigid in the extreme, and she regarded the
unfortunate cock with a glassy stare worthy of a disapproving Duchess
in a novel by Ouida. Although she did not actually pursue him about
the aviary, as a Broadtail would have, she lunged at him if he ventured
anywhere near her, and would not allow him under the sheltered part
of the aviary at all.
I then moved them both into an aviary of quite a different type
with an enclosed shelter, and at once the hen was perfectly amicable
with him, even when shut in the shelter at night. After three weeks
or so, thinking they had got quite used to each other, and that the hen
might breed better in her old aviary, I put them back in it, and
immediately the hen became as hostile to him as before, glaring at him
as though he were a complete and highly undesirable stranger. Once
more I transferred them to the other aviary and once more peace
reigned, this time with her actually making advances to him !
One may say that the hen's behaviour was strange--and so it was--
but I suppose it is only on a par with the widow who marries again,
and doesn't mind living with her new husband in a new house, but
couldn't bear the thought of doing the same thing in the old one-- -*
which would " have associations " for her !

This matter of association is very strong in birds ; it is clear that the
hen Alexandrine associated her old aviary so strongly with her former
husband, and the covered part of it with where her last year's brood
was reared that, while the new cock was permitted to sit unmolested
in the open part of the aviary, he must on no account be allowed under
the covered part where the nest-box used to hang. Taken away from
these familiar surroundings her hostile attitude towards him ceased
immediately.
It is for this reason that it is so important in the case of really
aggressive parrakeets such as Broadtails never to put a newly acquired
hen into a cock's aviary, particularly of course if he has recently lost
his wife. Even if he has not been previously mated he will be apt to
resent the sudden appearance of a hen in his aviary, and will be quite
capable of scalping her unless a careful watch is kept to see that they
agree.
The best plan is to put the hen in an aviary by herself for several
weeks--preferably in sight of the cock--and then put him in her aviary,
where he will feel like a new boy at school and will be too busy ex-
ploring his unfamiliar surroundings to attack the hen.
Of the Broadtails I have kept I have found Brown's Parrakeets by
far the most difficult to re-mate, and one of the most deadly aggressors
if they happen to disapprove of the partner you offer them, so anyone
possessing these rare and beautiful parrakeets would be wise to take
every precaution when re-mating them, or even when mating them for
the first time. Before the war we had at Keston a wonderful breeding
pair of Brown's who reared a large number of young ones during the
years we had them, and when eventually the hen died, the cock was
very pathetic and quite inconsolable and indeed did not long survive
his wife. Any hope of re-mating him was quite out of the question as
he savagely attacked any hen that was put with him. Such constancy
among parrakeets must be rare.
At the other end of the scale, Stanleys, as well as being the smallest
and one of the most attractive of the Broadtails are by far the easiest
to re-mate.
Grass parrakeets usually are quite easy to mate or to re-mate, though
Turquoisines are, as they are at all times, the most inclined to squabble.
Redrump Parrakeets may be " faithful unto death " but that, I fear,
is as far as their faithfulness goes, as I have found that members of either
sex are only too willing to clasp to their bosoms, with almost indecent
haste, any reasonably presentable partner that is offered to them !
I would say that most Cockatoos are quite easy to re-mate, and in
my experience Lesser Sulphur-crested, and Citron-crested, and
perhaps to a lesser extent Leadbeater's, usually regard a new
partner without any great show of interest. Roseates, on the other
hand, are more demonstrative and therefore more amusing, and, if

the meeting is a success--as it usually is--they go through the strangest
antics ; raising and lowering their crests ; preening each other's
crests ; and the cock, apparently desiring to admire his fiancee's
profile from either side, never climbs or flies over her, but invariably
tries to climb under her, often falling off in the process ; this being the
signal for much raucous screaming and agitated raising of crests !
Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots, and other members of the Amazon
family, are capricious : sometimes a newly introduced cock and hen
will take to each other almost at once, slowly approaching each other
along the perch with wings slightly lowered and thrust forward
(presumably to display the differing colours at the bend of the wing
as a sex-recognition sign), head feathers raised, and eyes blazing, the
latter apparently being used to denote either anger or pleasure, and if,
having met, they sit side by side and putting their heads in the air,
utter their extraordinarily varied assortment of chortling cries--you
can assume that they approve of each other. Sometimes, however,
a pair will eye each other with suspicion--even for several weeks--
although they may eventually become perfectly good friends. There
is usually no risk to life and limb so long as they have plenty of room
to keep out of each other's way, but on no account should they be
confined together in at all a small space.
African Grey Parrots are a different proposition altogether, being
temperamentally quite unlike any other member of the parrot family.
When one has been living by itself in an aviary and another is put
with it, there is seldom any sort of demonstration on either side ; dead
silence reigns while they eye each other warily, though contriving to
maintain an air of boredom. Suddenly one or both will give vent to
one of their rudest noises or else a shrill whistle, and then again there
will be silence, while they both look apprehensively round as much as
to say " Who made that noise " ?
After a long interval of inactivity, the original occupant of the aviary
may sometimes be seen sidling in a slow and sinister manner towards
the newcomer, and at this point, if the latter stays put and has not the
sense to remove itself out of harm's way to another perch, it should be
rescued before it gets hurt. If, however, it gets out of the light, and
the birds are not in a confined space, it is usually safe to leave them
together. Even if they prove to be a true pair, a state of armed
neutrality may be expected to persist for several days or even longer,
and it is only when you see them, with locked beaks, pumping their
heads rapidly up and down, that you can be sure you have got a true
pair and if, after this friendly demonstration, the cock gives the hen
a sly nip on the leg, causing her to squawk with pain, there is nothing
to worry about, for it is all part of a Grey Parrot's strange courtship !

JANUARY, 1953, AT DIEP RIVER, S. AFRICA
By Allan Frank (Diep River, Cape Town, S. Africa)
My main aviary accommodation consists of a large planted aviary
measuring 75 feet long, 50 feet wide, 10 feet high, in which are built
two sheds measuring 30 feet by 9 feet by 8 feet high, and 10 feet by
9 feet by 8 feet high respectively. The aviary is well planted with
flowering trees and shrubs, with a miniature rivulet winding through-
out its length.
The breeding season in this part of the country takes place from
September to February ; some of the Australian species continue
breeding up to June. In this aviary, I keep quite a large selection
of both soft bills and hard bills, which include approximately 120
different species. The following species have been bred and success-
fully reared during the period mentioned above, i.e. September, 1952,
to January, 1953 : Blue-breasted Waxbills, Little Ruddies, Scathy-
headed Weavers, Melba Finches, Grey Java Sparrows, Golden
Sparrow, Spice Birds, Tricolour Nuns, Cuban Finches, Long-tailed
Grass Finches, Silver-eared Mesia, and Silver-blue Tanagers.
A pair of Pekin Robins nested and hatched two chicks but, unfortu-
nately, owing to some disturbance or other, the chicks died after five
days. I am glad to say, however, that another pair of Pekin Robins
is at present sitting on two eggs.
I obtained a pair of Silver-eared Mesias (Mesia argentauris Hodgson)
three years ago, and during breeding season before last, that is, 1950-51,
these birds went to nest no less than three times and on each occasion
two eggs were laid and the young successfully hatched, but it was
found that after five to six days, the chicks died. Then last breeding
season, this pair of Silver-eared Mesias went to nest in September
in a " Morning Glory " creeper. The chicks were hatched and the
parents neglected them after three days.
In October they went to nest again in a Loquat tree where again
the chicks were hatched and died after seven days. In December,
1952, they again went to nest and built a deep cup-shape nest of
broad leaves lined with coir in the fork of a peach tree situated
5 feet from the ground ; two eggs of a pale blue colour, blotched at
the thick end with brown, were laid, and were successfully hatched.
(Incubation period uncertain.) After three days, one of the chicks
was found dead on the ground under the nest and had evidently been
removed by the parents. The remaining chick was well catered for
by the parents and was fed on mealworms which were placed in a small
box attached to one of the branches of the peach tree, into which a dozen
mealworms were placed five times a day. On the tenth day, the chick

left the nest, but was unable to fly very well, and the parents fed this
chick on the ground. I am happy to state that the young Mesia is
now fully grown and it would appear that, under better conditions,
that is, without interference from other birds, it would be quite easy
to breed this species in captivity.
My Silver-blue Tanagers went to nest on approximately 18th
November, laying three eggs of a very faint blue texture, blotched
with brown at the thick end. They built a shallow-cupped nest of
twigs lined with coir in a dry bush, which was fixed to one of the
aviary supports and about 5 feet from the ground. The incubation
period is uncertain, but I would say approximately 17 days. Three
chicks were hatched, which left the nest after fifteen days. The chicks
were fed by the parents on mealworms and termites. Some difficulty
was experienced in feeding these mealworms to the parents, owing to
the large collection contained in the aviary ; however, this was over-
come by placing a small w r ooden tray 3 feet below the nest in which a
small quantity of mealworms were placed five times a day. The
young Tanagers were of a drab silver-blue colour when leaving the
nest, and they are now flying about in a healthy condition.
It would appear that this species breeds quite freely and the
parents are now again sitting, but unfortunately this time their nest
is built in a " Morning Glory 55 creeper, 9 feet from the ground.
Consequently it is impossible to make full observations.

PARRAKEET EYE DISEASE

By Dr. F. B. Lake (Kingston-on-Thames, England)
Contagious conjunctivitis has long been the bane of those interested
in the Australasian parrakeets. Practically confined to newly imported
birds of the more desirable species, the disease has ruined many a
precious consignment. Formerly it was almost invariably fatal.
The bird arrived with a " sticky eye " or developed one shortly after
arrival, and despite all the owner could do, progressed slowly but
inexorably to a fatal termination some weeks or months later.
There have, however, been some reports of cures. John Yealland
cured some of the larger parrakeets years ago with instillations 01
mercury perchloride, but did not succeed with Grass Parrakeets.
Mr. Vane has had success with sulphonamides. David West senior
cured a Many-coloured with aureomycin and yellow oxide of mercury,
and Mr. T. Holmes Watkins a Splendid with sulphonilimide. I believe
there have also been successes with penicillin.
I recently had the opportunity of investigating and treating six cases
of this disease, and whilst these do not provide sufficient data for final

conclusions, I think the results sufficiently suggestive to be of some
value. Of these six birds, four are cured, one probably cured, but still
under observation, and one still under treatment at the time of writing.
The clinical appearance of affected birds is fairly constant. The
disease begins as a slight thickening of the margin of the eyelids, some-
times with some beading of the smooth edge of the lid, so that the
lid margin, almost invisible in health, becomes an obvious thickened
rim round the open eye. There is slight, usually watery, discharge,
sometimes so little as to be hardly noticeable. The bird blinks
frequently and rubs its eyes on the perches. After a time the eyelids
and tissues of the orbit exhibit a watery swelling which displaces the
feathers from the margin of the eye, and leaves a ring of bare puffy
skin round the eye. Finally the swelling becomes gross, the eye cannot
fully be opened, the lids are often stuck together in the mornings by
dried discharge, which tends to become more abundant and purulent,
and is frequently rubbed off on to the perches or the plumage of the
bird's shoulders. The unfortunate bird may linger on in this state for
several weeks before death ensues.
Of the various remedies now available, sulphonamides such as
sulphonilimide are effective against a number of bacteria which may
infect the eye. Penicillin is effective against a considerably larger
number and the new drugs aureomycin and Chloromycetin are effective
against nearly all the organisms causing conjunctivitis in man, with a
few exceptions. Antiseptics such as \ per cent zinc sulphate, i/ioooo
perchloride of mercury, or 5 per cent silver protienate may be employed
with some effect in cases which do not respond to the new remedies.
If the germ responsible can be cultured from the infected eye, the
bacteriologist will report on its sensitivity to the antibiotic drugs, and
so one knows at once which to select, and what prospect of success
one has. Failing such a culture, one can try one after another until
one finds a remedy to which the particular infection is sensitive.
The eyes of the birds I treated were swabbed with dry sterile cotton
wool, using an ordinary medical throat swab, and the swabs sent to a
pathology laboratory for culture. Partly I think, because of the
technical difficulty of getting a good smear of a small bird's eye, and
partly because I was obliged to send my specimens by post, in only
two cases was a pathogenic organism isolated. These rather sur-
prisingly grew a penicillin-resistant strain of staphlococcus aureus.
Staph, aureus is a common septic organism of world wide distribution,
causing a variety of septic infections in man and animals. Most
strains are highly sensitive to penicillin, a few (such as this one) are
penicillin-resistant, and these usually respond to aureomycin or
Chloromycetin. Staphlococci are not usually affected by sulphona-
mides, and a case cured by sulphonilimide must have been infected
with some other organism.

To consider my cases in detail :--
(i) Hen Barraband. Advanced disease in one eye ; the other
normal. Culture failed to grow. Various antibiotics tried successively
--at first as a spray applied several times daily. With penicillin the
condition became worse. With J per cent zinc sulphate no improve-
ment. Suspension of aureomycin produced temporary improvement,
but failed to make further progress after three weeks. Chloromycetin,
J per cent spray showed no change, and the disease appeared in the
other eye.
The bird was then, after three months of experiments, rather worse
than when she arrived. The disease had been somewhat checked in
the bad eye, but had started in the originally healthy one. I then,
almost in despair, tried a new and improved preparation of Chloro-
mycetin which had just come on to the market. This was far too
expensive to apply as a spray and I was forced to catch the bird daily
and put the preparation directly into the eyes with a dropper. This
proved to be the secret. With the much more effective concentration
of the drug obtained, and the mechanical washing out of the pus by
repeating the dropping every minute for five minutes, once daily, a
rapid improvement occurred and the bird was well in a fortnight.
I had at first been obsessed with the idea that I must avoid daily
catching, for fear that the bird's general health would not stand so
much handling. When I eventually had to do it, I found this fear
quite groundless, providing one used a very small cage into which one
could put one's hand and take the bird without fuss and with no
room for the bird to hurt itself trying to evade capture.
Cases (2) (3) (4) treated together. Another hen Barraband and
two Crimson-wings. All had moderately severe disease of both eyes.
From the Barraband and one of the Crimson-wings a germ was
successfully cultured and reported as 44 Staphlococcus aureus ",
resistant to sulphonamides and penicillin, sensitive to Chloromycetin,
and very sensitive to aureomycin. From this report aureomycin was
obviously the treatment of choice, and was applied by dropping the
eyes once daily with a suspension of aureomycin powder in distilled
water, 40 milligrammes in 5 c.c. All responded well. The Crimson-
wings were cured in three weeks. The Barraband, however, twice
developed a severe enteritis (she had loose droppings on arrival), and
her treatment had to be suspended whilst she was given heat, and
sulphamezathine in her drinking water for the enteritis. She is
probably cured now, but has not been under observation long enough
after cessation of treatment to be sure.
Cases (5) (6) Bourkes Parrakeets. Both had been treated before arrival
with sulphonilimide, without improvement. Cultures failed to grow.
(5) had slight thickening of the eyelids and hardly any discharge.
It was cured after two weeks daily dropping with aureomycin.

DR. F. B. LAKE-PARRAKEET EYE DISEASE 65
(6) had mild disease in one eye, and fairly severe disease in the other.
It improved very very slowly, and after three weeks had made so little
progress that (in the absence of any bacteriological report to help) it
was thought penicillin might be worth a trial, and in three days
penicillin drops produced definite improvement. The bird then
unfortunately became severely ill and had to spend two weeks in the
hospital cage, with suspension of treatment, and both eyes relapsed.
It is now under treatment again and improving slowly, but had a great
deal of lost ground to make up. The large parrakeets were held in the
hand and a drop put in each eye, each minute for five minutes. The
Bourkes proved too frail to endure this and I was obliged to be content
with one drop in each eye and immediate return to the cage. This,
I think, was the reason for the relative failure of aureomycin in case (6).
In all cases cure was only assumed if the bird had been observed for
at least two weeks without treatment and showed no sign of recurrence
of thickening of the eyelids in that time.
Although most of my cases were infected with penicillin-resistant
organisms, I think it improbable that this represents the usual state of
affairs. Penicillin is highly effective against most strains of staph lo-
cocci and against most germs that sulphonamides will kill, although
not quite all. Aureomycin is the antibiotic of widest range and is
effective against nearly all bacteria likely to cause conjunctivitis. It is,
however, in short supply in the United Kingdom ; Chloromycetin,
available here, is nearly as good. Penicillin, being non-irritant and
very freely soluble, would be best for penicillin-sensitive cases--as
probably the majority are. Sulphonamides would be effective in a fair
number of cases, but not against staphlococci, so that there seems little
to be gained by trying them before proceeding to penicillin or the
' mycins '. In conclusion, it seems established, that parrakeet eye
disease is a septic conjunctivitis which can be caused by staphlococcus
aureus, and probably by a number of other septic organisms as well.
Why it should be confined to a few species of Australasian parrakeets,
is difficult to explain. It may perhaps be due to inherent lack of
resistance in these birds rather than a species--specific infection.
It should be curable in most cases by systematic dropping with a
suitable antibiotic. I think it would be best to try penicillin first, and
if no improvement is noticed in, say, one week, to proceed to aureo-
mycin or Chloromycetin--one or the other of these drugs is likely to
prove effective.
I am most grateful to those members who have entrusted me with
their sick birds for this investigation and hope that the results may
be of some help in the future management of this disease. Of course
more cases need to be investigated before final conclusions can be
drawn.

(.Lorius roratus pectoralis)
By H. J. Indge (Thorpe, Surrey, England)
A batch of twelve Eclectus Parrots arrived on the 13th April, 1952 ;
ten Red-sided and two Grand. The latter were taken by one of our
lady members, and within a few days I transferred all the Red-sided
to various outdoor enclosures. I took them out each morning and
brought them back to the bird-room each evening. It may be
interesting to know that I took each on my finger for these trips.
One day, one of the cocks took wing, and although he made no
elevation, he flew quite a hundred feet, with beautiful outstretched
wings. I believe he was the only full-winged bird among them, so I
transferred him, together with the most promising-looking hen, to an
aviary to themselves and left them out altogether. This must have
been very early in May, and although we had several frosts that
month, the birds were not any the worse for it, even though they had
no artificial heat.
By the middle of June the hen had taken to the nest-box, coming out
occasionally, and by the end of June she stayed in the whole time,
coming out only for a few minutes a day. How many visits were
made to the box, to look through the inspection hole, I don't know ;
each time the hen came off, I should say, until we nearly tired of
looking and believed the hen was just pretending. However, just
once more--that was the 29th July--lo ! and behold! an egg ! The
next day another !
Immediately the hen sat tight, coming off only for the bare necessities
about twice a day, when she moved no further than a foot from the
entrance. Each time we had the chance to inspect, we did, and know
for a positive fact that one egg hatched on the 24th August and the
second the next day. We had a chance to watch the chicks for a few
days, and then one disappeared ; probably died and was flattened out.
The inspection hole was such that we could see into the nest through
a tiny aperture, but could not, nor would not, interfere further.
They were born devoid of down, just like budgerigars, and at
thirteen days we noticed a light grey fluff, darkening to the darkest
grey and appearing to have the texture of the coat of a woolly monkey.
At five weeks a feather, like an emerald, could be seen on the back,
and from then on he feathered quickly ; well, as far as quickly goes
with Eclectus Parrots.
On the 20th November, he left the nest, after having spent three or
four days in contemplation. I wanted to go to the National Show
and as a severe frost seemed likely, I took him and his parents, and

placed them in a flight in the birdroom. A risk, I know, but all went
well, and a fortnight later, he was picking up food for himself.
The aviary in which the parents lived was 12 feet by 6 feet by 7 feet
high. The cock spent most of his day in the shelter, indulging in a
couple of flights around the aviary daily, but always ready to answer
the hen's call for food. This was a strange, high-pitched affair, which
could be heard 500 yards away, and she started calling right from the
time she first went into the box, until I took them into the birdroom--
some 5 months.
During the whole of that time, the cock was seen to go into the box
only twice, once for about two minutes, and the other time for as
many seconds. The hen always came to the entrance hole to be fed.
She seemed to have the parental love of a mammal rather than of a
bird, but then, there is something so very different about an Eclectus.
She never flew, as her flights were clipped, and even now that the
new feathers have grown, she has never taken wing. About a fortnight
ago I decided to separate them, but the family seemed so dejected,
that they were united again.
During the time the youngster was being fed, I gave a quantity of
green food, but I never particularized, just picked whatever came to
my hand in the garden, in the way of weeds, and also marigold and
forget-me-nots, both leaves and flowers. I was reluctant to give fruit,
although just occasionally I gave a grape or piece of apple. The seed
mixture consisted of sunflower and canary.
The youngster was slightly darker than his father, with a horn-
coloured bill. Now, except for the tip of the bill still having a smudge,
there is no difference.

The Chairman, opening the meeting, said she had very great
pleasure in welcoming Professor Berlioz, of the Paris Natural Flistory
Museum, who was the world's foremost authority on Humming
Birds. Professor Berlioz, in response, said he was delighted to have
the opportunity of attending a Club meeting.
On introducing Viscount Alanbrooke, the Chairman said the Club
greatly appreciated that amidst his many official duties he had found
time to pay a second visit. The appreciation was the more obvious
by virtue of the fact that the attendance was easily a record.
Viscount Alanbrooke showed his two new colour films, " Waders "
and " The Flamingoes of the Camargue ". The former, taken on
Hilbre Island, Dee Estuary, showed a large variety of wading birds.
The sequence of a Curlew preening with salt water was of special
interest. Viscount Alanbrooke gave an amusing account of the
difficulty experienced in locating the Flamingoes. Due to disturbance,
possibly by low flying aircraft, they had moved to new breeding
grounds. The Camargue is apparently threatened by various reclama-
tion schemes, but French ornithologists will, of course, make every
possible effort to preserve this exceptionally interesting area.
There were some good slow-motion pictures of Flamingoes in
flight ; and in the close-ups it was interesting to note the striking
variation in the size of nesting birds. There were also some good
shots of the Bee-eater.
The excellence of the films was only matched by the commentary,
and at the end the large audience showed by its sustained applause
that it had indeed appreciated Viscount Alanbrooke's efforts.
The next meeting of the Club is on 13th May, 1953.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Animal Health Division)
has decided to reimpose the ban on the importation of Parrots. The
Order, 44 Parrots and Miscellaneous Birds (Prohibition of Importa-

of the Order, price 2&lt; 7 ., may be obtained from H.M. Stationery Office,
York House, Kingsway, W.C. 2.
Until further notice 44 No person shall import into Great Britain from
any other country or part of a country any bird to which this Order
applies ", namely, " live birds of any of the following descriptions,
that is to say--birds of the species Psittaciformes, including any
of the birds commonly called parrots, parrakeets, budgerigars, love-
birds, macaws, cockatoos, cockatiels, conures, lories, and lorikeets."
In addition to preventing the spread of ornithosis (sometimes called
psittacosis), the regulations are aimed at safeguarding the country's
poultry flocks against the introduction of fowl pest from abroad.

sexes, some of which have proved quite unreliable. Similarly, he quite
correctly states that the Peachfaced has no eye-ring, yet the colour
plate shows a distinct white area round the eye. On this plate the
Redfaced appears to be an undersized Peachface and the eye-rings of
the Blackcheek and Masked are comparatively too small.
Several historical facts are not correct. The Blue Masked first
appeared in this country some four or five years prior to its arrival in
the United States. The Lutino Nyasa has never been bred in this
country. The Blackcheek, far from being the most commonly met with
to-day, is along with the Madagascar and Nyasa, practically unob-
tainable owing to export restrictions in its country of origin, no
importer secured a consignment during the raising of the ban.
Such inaccuracies must lead to confusion among beginners and
irritation to more knowledgeable readers ; a great pity in view of the
invaluable worth of the chapters on management, aviary construction,
and behaviour in captivity.

Barbary Doves

<bodyText confidence="0.984686967741936" page_id="56291830"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
Mr. Derek Goodwin's interesting article on the Barbary Dove brought to mind
my early and pleasant experiences with this species.
In California they are very frequently sold under the name of Ring-neck Dove.
As they are very cheap to buy they are often the species the novice first under-
takes. They were among the first birds I purchased as a very young boy--and I can
well remember my first pair costing the sum of a dollar--a rather sizeable sum for
an eleven-year-old.
My one pair bred well and in a short period of time I had many more Barbary
Doves than I could possibly use. Because most pet stores were already filled to over-
flowing with them (what price must dealers have paid for them to sell a pair for a
dollar ?) it was virtually impossible to get rid of one's surplus.
We used to let a few out in the garden--and they stayed very well. Unfortunately
for the Barbary Dove the cats would invariably reduce their numbers. The Barbary
Doves aided and abetted the cats in their destruction by conveniently sitting on
garage and aviary roofs--" sitting ducks " for their enemy.
One fall, when we had about eight youngsters to dispose of, we caught them
up and released them on a ranch some six miles away. This ranch was in a locality
where California Quail and the California Mourning Dove abounded, and so it
was felt that the Barbary Doves would have a good chance to succeed. Their homing
instinct was nil for none of the eight returned to their home aviaries. Whether any
of the released birds lived and/or bred I am unable to say.
Occasionally one sees a Barbary or two in with groups of other pigeons or doves.
At the San Juan Capistrano Mission (some seventy miles from Los Angeles) the
Barbary Dove apparently breeds right at the Mission. The Mission gardens abound
with pigeons and also a few Barbary Doves--all very tame as they are constantly
fed by visitors. In downtown Los Angeles' Pershing Square I have seen Barbary
Doves associating with common pigeons--and apparently thriving.
I might add that we formerly raised many hybrids between a male Barbary
and a female California Mourning Dove. The Mourning Dove we inherited from a
friend who had found it with a damaged wing. The wing healed, and the bird
(which had been kept in an outside aviary) refused to leave when it was released.

Instead it brought back a mate and we trapped the pair and subsequently reared
many young. The youngsters were usually released and they would generally
stay for a few days and then wander away. When the male Mourning Dove died we
replaced him with a male Barbary Dove, and this arrangement certainly suited the
hen for they instantly began family operations.
It might be of interest to note that this female California Mourning Dove was
a known eleven years old when she finally died. She bred right up to her death,
though in her last years sometimes only a single chick would be raised.
The Chinese Necklace Dove is firmly established around the Los Angeles area.
I see it very frequently--and it certainly appears to be as common as the local
California Mourning Dove, at least in our locality. It not infrequently associates
with the Mourning Dove, small mixed groups of four, five, or six being seen feeding
in vacant lots, etc. The Chinese Dove appears rather intelligent for pairs around
frequently fly into our garage for spilled grains--a feat the local Mourning Dove
has never accomplished.
The Chinese Necklace Dove is a very desirable addition and doubtless a good
sporting bird. There is a pair which nests in a pear tree in our yard--and they
usually nest several times a year.
From memory I believe a rather detailed history of this bird in California has
recently appeared in the Condor, Journal of the Cooper Ornithological Club.

THE PROBLEM OF THIRD BROODS OF PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993381875" page_id="56291831"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
In regard to Mr. Boosey's letter about Turquoisines, I certainly should not attempt
to haul a nest-box out of the aviary when the young are at their wildest stage.
There are however, methods of avoiding undue damage to the young and at the
same time of preventing the hen from rearing a third brood.
With the rarer and more timid Grass Parrakeets I am coming back to my original
view that the roof of the aviary should have an inner lining of string netting and, in
addition, before the young of even the first brood have left the nest, a good thick
screen of branches should be tacked on to the wire-netting over the whole end of the
flight to prevent them crashing against that.
Coming now to the problem of the third brood, when the second brood are still
in the nest and the hen has not yet started to lay her third clutch, you can remove
the cock and also, if you like, the second nest-box. In order to encourage the hen
to make a good job of finishing feeding the second brood single-handed, she should
be given more hemp than it is usually safe to give Turquoisines and also an abundant
supply of the choicest seeding grass. The cock should be placed in a cage in the
bird-room and fed on very plain seed and green food, a combination of circum-
stances which will encourage him to go out of breeding condition and start moulting.
He should not be put in another aviary as he will be more restless there and call
continually to the hen and he may also, very likely, pick up some deadly microbe,
as late summer is the time when these pests are most virulent. When the right time
is thought to have arrived to take the young birds away from their mother (they
have got to be moved some time), you can also remove the nest-box and put the cock
back with his mate and she, too, will not be long in dropping into moult while the
weather is still good.
An alternative plan is to leave both parents in the aviary and, when the last young
one of the second brood has left the nest a few days, go in and net the whole brood
as quickly as you can before&amp;apos;they have time to do themselves serious damage. Put
them in a cage in the bird-room and cover the whole floor of the cage with seed and
seeding grass and keep the bird-room at a comfortably warm temperature. There is
little doubt, if they are healthy and well-reared, that they will start feeding adequately
as soon as they begin to get hungry but, if you like, you can put with them a young
Budgerigar which has started to feed itself freely, in order to give them a lead. When

they are feeding freely and have steadied down a bit they can be put back in an
aviary, being first confined to the shelter for a day or two so that they grow accustomed
to it and know where to find the food. It is, of course, necessary that their new
aviary should have the same arrangements with regard to protection of the roof and
end of the flight. There they can remain happily until they moult into adult plumage
and begin to quarrel ; or (as is much more likely, as Mr. Boosey is as well aware as I),
until they die of pneumonia or nephritis ; get clawed by a sparrowhawk ; or fall a
victim to X's latest practical joke ! When the young are out of the parents' aviary,
you can, of course, remove the nest, and the third clutch of eggs which Lovebirds
may take if you have any.
Mr. Boosey mentions a hen he has had for several years which has reared three
broods each season, but can he tell us how many hens he has lost before they have
put up this satisfactory record and how many young of the third broods have matured
into good breeding stock ?
There are, no doubt, hundreds of hen Budgerigars which have reared three or
more broods in a season and survived for q reasonable period, but that does not
alter the fact that it is the almost universal practice of breeders who want to produce
stock of the highest quality to limit the number of nests to two.

FOOD OF PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948740227272727" page_id="56291832"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
I was very interested in what Mr. E. J. Boosey had to say about sweetened rice
and milk as a food for his Plum-headed Parrakeet as this corresponds with my own
experience in India.
When I was at Karwar, a very lovely place on the west coast of India, I had some
young Malabar Parrakeets brought to me which had been fed on the usual diet of
parched gram flour, moistened with water. They seemed too far gone to help, but
I remembered an article by Dr. Amsler in which he described how he had fed his
breeding Swainson's Lorikeets on boiled rice and milk and honey sugar. I, therefore,
got Fernandes, our cook, who was very interested in birds, to make me some rice
mould sweetened with brown sugar. I do not think the fact that the sugar was
brown made any difference. Two of the little things were too far gone to save, but
the two stronger ones ate this new food avidly and grew into fine birds. I used this
food also for some tiny Hanging Lorikeets and they throve upon it.
I have often thought the diet of hard grain inadequate for Parrakeets. The Malabar
Parrakeet, so far as my experience goes, is a forest lover, and I should think that
its diet consists far more of soft wild fruits than hard grain. Incidentally, I think I am
the person to whom Mr. Boosey refers in one of his articles, who told him about the
breeding of the Grey Parrot in India. It only shows what an unbelieving fellow
Mr. Boosey is and what a bad judge of character he was, in this particular case.

Madam,-- May I return to the subject of the letter from Mr. I. J. Ferguson Lees
( antea, 1952, j&lt; 9 , 194), the Collared Turtle Dove, Streptopelia decaocto ?
These are once more being offered for sale in this country.
Meanwhile the spread of the wild species through Europe continues ; it has now
bred in Sweden and has reached the Ardennes in Northern France. If any reach
Britain it is of the greatest importance that they should be protected from confusion
with escaped or released imported birds.
In Germany quite a number of wild Collared Turtle Doves have already been
ringed, and two have been recovered (both show that first-year birds can travel long
distances) ; so may I suggest that all those who purchase Collared Turtle Doves,
whether they intend to keep them at liberty or not, should mark their birds with
coloured , not aluminium, rings.

THE SCARLET-TUFTED MALACHITE SUNBIRD

The Scarlet-tufted Malachite Sunbird was first obtained by
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.988879153846154" page_id="56291840"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Sir Harry Johnston on Kilimanjaro in 1884. An account of the
species together with a coloured plate of an adult male appear in
Sir Frederick J. Jackson's Birds of Kenya Colony and the Uganda Pro-
tectorate , vol. 3.
Mr. John C. Williams has contributed a valuable paper "Nectarinia
johnstoni : a Revision of the Species, together with Data on Plumages,
Moults and Habits," (. Ibis , 93 1951, pp. 579-595) in which he
demonstrates (in agreement with Sclater) that there are three races :
" N. johnstoni is therefore separable into N. j. johnstoni, a long-winged,
long-billed form with green metallic plumage in the males ; N. j.
salvadorii, a short-winged, short-billed race, also with green metallic
plumage, and N. j. dartmouthi , a long-winged, short-billed race with
bluish-green metallic plumage in the males and dark brown females."
N. j. johnstoni is most common on the alpine moorlands of Mount
Kenya from about 11,000-14,000 feet on the western side and from
10,000 to 10,500 feet on the eastern slopes--wherever the Giant
Lobelia (. Lobelia keniensis) is in bloom.
Of the diet, Mr. Williams says, " The main food of the typical
race is Diptera, small flies forming the bulk (ca. 85 %) of the contents
of the 28 stomachs examined. Also included in the stomach contents,
in order of frequency, are the following : minute Coleoptera ;
spiders ; unidentified insect (?) fragments; yellow vegetable matter (?) ;
pollen (once recorded). Nectar was almost certainly present, but was
difficult to detect."
Of the roosting habits he says, " On several occasions old birds were
observed to retire to roost in deep holes, excavated originally by the

Mountain Chat (. Pinarochroa sordida) in the matted dead leaf clusters
of the Tree Groundsel ( Senecio keniodendron) . These holes, which must
give much protection to this sunbird during the bitterly cold nights,
are sometimes, perhaps as a rule, used communally, as on one occasion
two females and a male were seen to enter a cavity within a few
minutes of one another. Immature birds were seen to enter disused
nests for resting and warmth."
It appears that the normal clutch is one egg only. There is an
eclipse plumage in JV. j. johnstoni and N. j. salvadorii , but it appears
doubtful whether this occurs in JV. j. dartmouthi.
Some of the JV. j. johnstoni (which is new to aviculture) were collected
on Mount Kenya by Mr. R. Bloom, and those kept at the London
Zoo have been thriving on the usual Sunbird food together with
house flies. One male which has spent the past winter in an outdoor
aviary (with a heated shelter) was often outside and singing in quite
cold weather.

<bodyText confidence="0.992674555555556" page_id="56291841"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
By Reginald T. Bloom (Ludham, Norfolk, England)
The idea of catching the Sunbird, Nectarinia johnstoni johnstoni, first
came into being when talking with Lord Chaplin one evening. As
a result of modern travel the comfort of an English fireside was soon
exchanged for the lower slopes of Mount Kenya, on whose high moor-
lands this bird makes its home, and my small mule safari was moving
ahead of me, following one of the many game trails which lead upwards
into the dim shadowy depths of the Giant Cedar forest.
Thousands of Parrakeets screeched high in the trees overhead ;
a Hartlaub's Touracou was flushed off a low branch, showing its
crimson wings ; Hornbills hooted in the higher branches, whilst
dragonflies and butterflies hovered over the thick beds of nettles. It
was an eerie journey, the Podo trees creaked and groaned and the
breeze rustled through the high branches^ admitting rays of sunlight
which formed strange moving patterns on the green below.
Gradually the way became steeper, ridges and deep valleys formed,
some with little streams running down them, but the game tracks
followed the ridges closely, making a track for us. Although there were

many signs of game, five elephants were the only big game we saw.
Soon the larger trees thinned and small glades bathed in sunlight were
a warm and cheerful change from the darkness, and a suitable place
suggested rest and food before entering the thick bamboo forest which
would engulf the remainder of the trail.
The bamboo forest commenced at about 9,000 feet and seemed to
swallow us and shut its mouth behind us, so sudden was the change.
It was darker and colder, with a damp, penetrating cold which chills to
the bones, and because of the stillness it was at times almost frightening.
It seemed as if the ground had sprouted a whole forest of organ pipes
which, draped in soft green lichen, rose about 40 feet, to interlace
grotesquely and form a series of arches resembling some vast witches 5
kitchen. These trees were placed so thickly that game trails formed the
only means of passage, and even then a way often had to be cleared
before the mules could pass. Their bulky loads suffered hard treatment,
and when they became entangled with the bamboo it snapped with a
sound like a shot which would echo through the forest.
It was a long four hours before the highest edge was finally reached
but, as suddenly as it had begun, this dense forest ended, the silence
and the darkness were behind, and they were replaced by the evening
sunlight and bird-song. The altitude was now about 10,000 feet and
the ground became more level, the country resembling an English
woodland scene with large oak-like trees draped with creepers. There
were bushes of feathery bamboos and clumps of brightly flowering
salvia ( Leonotis ) on which hundreds of Goldenwings, Bronzy, and
Malachite Sunbirds were feeding.
These birds were fighting and squabbling, and there was a continual
noise of angry chattering. Their nests were hanging like large cocoons
bofh from the young bamboos and from the Leonotis , which grew to a
height of about 15 feet.
Now it was possible to look down over the green forest belt to the
golden plains below, rising and falling in broad undulating curves
until they joined the Aberdare Mountains, 50 miles away. The tent
was pitched snugly in an elbow of the forest before the sun sank behind
the near-by hills. As supper was cooked in the embers raked from an
enormous log fire the frost fell and the wind blew bitterly cold, so that
one froze on one side and roasted on the other. In the morning the
small tent was frozen like a board and the trees and ground were
covered with a thick hoar frost which crunched underfoot.
The camp was kept in the shelter of the forest edge, which ended
abruptly and gave way to open moorland. This moorland continued
from about 11,000 feet until it reached the snows at 15,000 feet, and it
was crossed by rugged ridges and steep, stony valleys, leading upwards
towards the massive glaciers and snowy peaks. The snow gleamed
brightly in the morning sunlight which, creeping over the mountain's

northern shoulder, lit the high ground in the plains below, until
eventually all was flooded with a soft golden light.
The tops of the ridges were covered in tree heather, Protea bushes,
and hundreds of brightly coloured flowers. On a Protea bloom the
first JVectariniajohnstoni was seen. It was a cock in full breeding plumage ;
its metallic green glistened, while its long, ribbon-like tail waved in the
breeze. It appeared to be less fidgety than other Sunbirds, feeding
quite unconcernedly, digging its bill into the petals of the flower in
search of the minute green beetles found on this plant, and occasionally
whistling to its mate. These birds showed a fondness for bathing and
could often be seen washing themselves as the top of the ice began to
melt from the puddles, or even breaking the ice on water which had
collected in the lobelia leaves so as to splash in that.
Suddenly a hen flew off a small egg-shaped nest built in the fork of a
near-by heather bush about 4 feet from the ground. The nest was
entered through a small hole in the end, the hole was facing away from
the prevailing northerly wind, and investigation proved that it was
lined with the furry down of the Protea seed pod.
During the next few days twenty nests were found, of which one
contained a single egg, seventeen a single chick, and two were empty.
All the nests were built in sheltered places, usually in heather bushes,
but there was no attempt to camouflage or conceal them. The single
egg was pink in colour and covered with dull red spots, these spots
being grouped more thickly at the broader end ; in size the egg was
similar to that of a sparrow.
Each pair of JVectariniajohnstoni appeared to have their own territory ;
this seemed to extend for about 200 square yards, and the birds
defended it vigorously. Should a territory be invaded by another cock
a terrific fight ensued, the two chasing each other at a truly amazing
speed, at times flying straight upwards until completely out of sight.
After this had happened the victor would glide slowly back, his breast
puffed out and his tail trailing high behind.
Both cock and hen fed the chick, which left the nest as soon as it was
able and fluttered from flower to flower, squatting from time to time
with its wings drooped and quivering.
On the higher moorlands, where the giant lobelia and giant groundsel
grew to a height of approximately 9 feet and resembled fields of
gigantic brussel sprout stalks, the birds were found in large numbers,
even as high as the permanent snows. The sunshine at this height was
quite warm, but as soon as the sun was covered by cloud it became
bitterly cold. These moorlands resemble those of Cumberland, having
the same windswept bleakness, and they are often blanketed in heavy
cloud, so that at times all is grey and dull. When the clouds pass over,
brilliant sunlight lights up the flowers and bushes, and the snow of
the mountain peaks gleams white against a deep blue sky.

The Kenya Malachite was the only other Sunbird seen on the moor-
land and it was quite easily distinguished because of its lighter colour
and its more slender body. It was never allowed to stay for very long,
being immediately chased off by the Nectarinia johnstoni.
It was noticed that the birds left the higher moorland near the snows
in the later afternoon and were seen in quantities on the lower slopes
just above the forest about four o'clock, whereas during the day only
the pairs were seen here. A number of fights seemed to take place on
the arrival of these daily migrations to the lower slopes.
Once captured, these birds could be examined more closely, but a
detailed description of them has already been published by John G.
Williams {Ibis, 93, 1951). They were found to accept captivity readily,
and in three days would take food from the hand. The return journey
was so arranged that the bird boxes were carried by hand and not by
mule. Frequent stops had to be made so as to rest and feed the birds.
After a short stay at the base camp the birds commenced their air
journey to London, where all arrived safely.

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
Psychological abnormalities in birds which involve a profound
departure from the usual instincts of their species are always in-
teresting. This year for the first time I have had a case of two hen
Budgerigars not only sharing the same mate, which is fairly common,
but also the same nest box, which is much less so. As a rule a hen
Budgerigar is violently jealous of another hen approaching her nest,
and any friendship which two hens may have formed prior to matri-
mony rapidly dissolves when the boxes are put in. When the nests
went into an aviary containing about nine pairs of homers, lively,
though not dangerous, squabbles were for a time the order of the
day. To my surprise, however, I noticed that in the midst of the
turmoil of female conflict a white-blue and a cobalt hen were
remaining the best of friends, rubbing noses and examining two
adjacent boxes with the most complete good will. The cobalt gave
way at times to the white-blue, but there was always civility on both
sides. Any other hen, however, who approached their boxes was
promptly attacked by one or both of the friends. That it was not
a simple case of two birds of the same sex achieving a " pair forma-
tion " relationship was, however, shown by the fact that both hens
accepted a yellow cock as their mate, and were as friendly towards
him as towards each other. For a time I thought that the cobalt

and the white-blue, in spite of their friendship, would end by each
taking one of the two boxes to which they had staked out a claim,
but suddenly they decided they could not be parted ; allowed a
weaker hen to take possession of one of their boxes ; and laid and
incubated side by side in the other one. The yellow cock obviously
enjoys having two wives, but if they present him with twelve children
he will learn that after supper comes the bill !
While this odd domestic problem was developing inside the aviary
a different one was being staged on a pond outside. Two full-winged
Carolina drakes had for many months enjoyed a bachelor friendship
which they found completely satisfying. In March, however, two
spinster ducks arrived on the scene and strove earnestly to persuade
the drakes to modify their views on matrimony. As far as I can
make out, they are not making much headway. Though not actively
hostile, the gentlemen are not a bit interested. They are perfectly
content to remain as they are, thank you !

A. GENERAL.
Doubtless this form is very close to Lampronessa , but it is not so close
as one might think at first. Still, the separation of the two genera
Aix and Lampronessa seems to me to be inconsistent with classifying
together such different birds as the Mallard and the Wigeon in the
genus Anas.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND CALLS.
These correspond in general to those of the Carolina Duck. The
drake's call-note, however, is not separated from the burp as in the
drake Carolina. A very nasal " Pfrrriub " takes the place of both calls.
When this sound is uttered the hood is ruffled to its greatest extent
(Fig. 50). The go-away and nest-hunting call of the duck is very like
that of the Carolina, but the drake has, in contrast to the drake
Carolina, no corresponding call, at least not so far as I know.

D. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE DRAKE.
i. The General Form of the Display.
The Mandarin drake takes less interest in the presence of the female
at the performance of his display
than any of the Anatidce that I
know. Even more than with the
Mallard the social display is an
affair of the males. The males
place themselves on show quite
passively without being the least
bit concerned about the presence
of females, almost like Black-
cocks, Ruffs, and other birds lack-
ing true pair-formation. Corre-
spondingly, in the social play of
Aix those orientation-reactions in
which other drakes, even the Mallard, give attention to the ducks
which are present, are lacking, namely the turning of the head and of
the back of the head. Only in the mock-preening is the drake oriented
toward the duck, but this behaviour occurs very seldom in the social
display. In the social play proper, the Mandarin drakes do not
court one particular female, just as Peacocks, Turkey Gobblers,,
Black Game, or Ruffs never do. It is also surely no coincidence that
this very species, where the active role in choosing a mate falls so
entirely to the female, is at the same time the one with the most highly
differentiated showy male plumage.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992212875" page_id="56291847"  page_num="82" year="" vol="">
These have become, in Aix, an absolutely linked behaviour-sequence
but in the reverse order in which we saw them in the Gadwall. After
an exaggerated drinking there follows a mock-preening (Fig. 49 a-c)
which is more formalized and marked by stronger morphological
differentiation than is the case in any other duck. That is to say,
Fig. 49 a, b, c .--The Mandarin drake drinking, linked with the mock-preening.
Notice how the dark green posterior portion of the hood springs up, making
the movement mimic-exaggerated. Compare the position of the plumage with
Fig. 50-
the Mandarin drake touches the large rust-red tertiaries which are
held up like a sail during every outburst of display from the inner side.
The drake performs the&amp;apos; drinking-and-mock-preening act very often
when he is standing on the shore beside his duck. Then both mates
drink at the same time, and thereupon the drake touches his beautiful
plume, invariably the one on the side next to the duck. As he drinks
his hood moves so that the movement is emphasized thereby (Fig. 49).

This is most striking because of the great size of the lifted hood and

bone-drum. The extreme stretching and arching of the neck, together

with the corresponding movements of the plumage, result in a most
grotesque spectacle. It looks almost as if the bird must put his neck
out of joint.
5. Display-Shaking.
The Mandarin drake has no real grunt-whistle but he displays
not less than three different behaviour patterns which have come from
mimic-exaggeration of shaking. The first reminds one of the male
Tadorna's display-shaking. First the head is lowered and then thrust
up very high, while a whirring sound is uttered. We can symbolize
&lt;# F WW WWW WWW . 5 5
the sound by these letters : One should try to

pronounce the " w 55 and the " r " at the same time. It is voiced
with this head movement. The hood is very much ruffled.

the Mandarin drake.
Fig. 50.--The Mandarin
drake's burp. Com-
pare Figs. 20, 24, 39,
and 46.
This is a behaviour sequence peculiar to
It consists of two separate movements both
derived from a displacement shaking. After
an ordinary introductory shaking, often
even without it, the drake dips his bill into
the water about 5 cm. from his breast, shaking
and squirting and then, continuing to shake,
he thrusts it up again. This behaviour differs
from an ordinary very hard shaking, such as
we have seen in the females of Aix and
Lampronessa, only by the movement being
so exaggerated that the bill is actually
dipped into the water in a way recalling
the grunt-whistle of the Anatina and never
occurring in the case of autochthonous shaking. Besides this, in
this movement the drake utters a sound which I have designated in
my diary as " Gnk-zit ", which expresses its similarity with a half-
repressed sneeze fairly well. Immediately after this action and always
linked to it, there now follows a second, which by its greater differentia-
tion is still farther separated from shaking. With a sharp bend of
the head, the bill is lowered vertically so that it dips into the water
right in front of the drake's breast. The tendency to lower the head,
which we have seen in the ordinary shaking of Aix and Lampronessa ,
is here mimic-exaggerated much more than in the previous movement.
With a very brief shaking, the very curved neck is now thrust upwards,
with which a short sneezing whistle is heard. I suspect that as a matter
of fact only one right-left movement takes place, as in the true grunt-
whistle of the Mallard and Pintail drakes. The body is not straightened

up afterwards. One can say that of these two linked shaking ceremonies
the first is barely differentiated from the ordinary introductory
substitute-shaking. The second is more differentiated but it has
remained, so to speak, half-way to the grunt-whistle. Therefore,
both are clearly intermediate forms between a displacement shaking
almost unaltered so far as the autochthonous shaking is concerned,
and the grunt-whistle of the Anatim. Thus the derivation of the
grunt-whistle from the shaking behaviour is made almost certain by
the two connecting links formed by the movements of the Mandarin
drake's " double grunt-whistle ".
7. The Combat of the Drakes.
This forms a very interesting chapter in the ethology of Aix. Like
the males of many birds that have an extreme social display and
extremely fine plumage, the drakes do not fight seriously. The shooting
along beside each other, which is so distinctive of the combat behaviour
of the drake Carolina and already tends with this species towards
ritualization, exists in Aix only as a much more purely " symbolic "
activity. As such, however, it plays an important role in social play.
Heinroth is right in comparing this behaviour pattern of the drakes,
as they shoot wildly around each other in this ceremony, with that of a
crowd of whirligigs ( Gyrinus ).
8. The Post-Coital Play.
This consists only of non-specific gestures of excitement, among which
burping, display-shaking, and aiming movements of the head can be
named.
Summary
If one wants to formulate a classification of a group with any
real success one must rid oneself once and for all of the idea that a
linear arrangement of the forms can really represent the relationship
existing between them. Naturally, this is true, too, when we spoke
previously of the ducks 44 about in a line ". All animals living to-day
are growing branch tips of a 44 family tree ", and can, ipso facto,
not be derived from " one another ". The comparison of their char-
acteristics results, therefore, in an arrangement which can be repre-
sented freely by the likeness of a family tree with branch tips like those
of a small round-clipped beech or yew tree. They lie all together
in one surface, which represents a cross-section through a bush growing
outwards at one point in time. Just as we can only tell by guessing
and judging appearances, because of the thick foliage of the tree
which we cannot see through, as to which ends belong to a common
branch and how far down they branch from the main stem, so the best
systematic arrangement can only give us reasonable speculations about
true evolutionary relationships.

I am now going to try to represent graphically, in a tabular diagram,
what we have gained through that kind of systematic intuition which
I tried to describe in the Introduction as a simultaneous review of as
many characters as possible. Only by evaluating all accessible char-
acters simultaneously can we achieve a proper judgment as to the
relative value of individual characters. First of all we must make a
brief deliberation of a fundamental nature. The similarity of a series of
forms, even if the series structure arises ever so clearly from a separa-
tion according to characters, must not be considered as establishing
a series of development stages. Let one imagine that, out of one
common root, a number of forms have grown out, all equally old
B
Fig. 51. --Diagram of a series of
similarities in recent animal forms
whose neighbouring members are
not joined by close genetic relation-
ship. When part of the lines of
descent fall out, the rest of the
forms, lying in the row A-B, can be
mistaken for phylogenetic series.

similarities of recent animal forms,

tionship. Every two neighbouring
forms in the row A-B owe their simi-
larities to the part of the path of de-

and equally differentiated from the root. We shall represent this family
tree structure in Fig. 51 as a kind of shaving brush. Now let us imagine
further that, as represented in one half of the brush, part of the hairs
have fallen out in such a manner that the rest remain somewhat
in the form of a fan. The tips then represent a step ladder leading from
A to B, which would seem convincing evidence that the forms have
descended " from one another ", especially if the degree of differentia-
tion is less on one edge of the fan than on the other. Doubtless the end-
points of such a " family tree " have already often been taken for
phylogenetical series, which unfortunately, places ever more welcome
weapons in the hands of the opponents of the theory of descent. On
the other hand, we must not fall into the opposite error to this too
ready formation of series and generalize in the view, that all similarity
of recent organisms might be explained from the principle of

fan-shaped classified lines of descent, as an over-generalization of
Kleinschmidt's theory would imply. Doubtless there are very many
cases in which not only a monophyletic development of large groups
of animals has taken place, with many individual forms not splitting
off till later, but also the further differentiation of the single forms, at
least in respect to single characters, took place at such different rates
that similarity lines arose as represented in the diagram in Fig. 52.
However in observing these similarities which correspond to a
phylogenetical staircase one must not forget for an instant that the term
" primitive 55 may be used only for one or several characteristics of a recent animal
form , never for the form as a whole. Even Sphenodon , or Ornithorhynchus ,
is not a " primitive animal ". The circumstance that some or even very
many characteristics of such a form are quite certainly phylogenetically
primitive, does not justify us in the presumption that all the rest of
their characteristics are also primitive. The stopping of further
differentiation of one character means nothing in respect to the course
of differentiation of the others.
The " intuitive feeling " of the professional systematist, which we
discussed in the Introduction, is generally well enough developed to
decide between similarity series which rest upon a common descent,
as has just been described, and such as arise through the previously
discussed phenomenon of classified descent-lines arranged in a fan
shape. In order to have a more objective criterion for this separation
I suggest the following consideration of probability. If one grants
that all the representatives of an animal group come from one source,
independent and diverging, without nearer connections with each
other, as represented in Fig. 51, then one would expect that the
similarities of characters which determine the arrangement as to which
lines of descent were to be placed side by side, would be divided
rather equally over the whole brush. If, for the sake of simplifying
the graphical representation we take a longitudinal section of the
brush, getting thus a number of fan-shaped, diverging lines of descent,
the similarities which bind each form to its systematic neighbour,
would have to go through the whole sheaf of lines homogeneously,
and especially from every point to both sides, hence, in the three
dimensional sheaf diagram, to all sides ; binding species with species
in like manner.
This type of distribution of characters actually occurs : in all so-
called " circles of forms 55 (Formenkreise) this holds true and Klein-
schmidt's theory of family-bushes (instead of family trees) is indubitably
correct if applied to these cases. A Formenkreis is nothing else than
a " shaving brush 55 in which the middle part has worn away, leaving
a circle of hairs, representing the single forms.
Now if one represents characters held in common as cross connec-

common to the larger divisions of the group toward the base and the
others more and more towards the periphery in proportion to the
narrowness of their distribution and their degree of specialization
and, consequently, their phylogenetic youth, there would be, in the
ideal case of the diverging sheaf-like type of species-formation, a
classification such as is represented in the diagram in Fig. 53.
Now we shall try to represent graphically, in the manner described,
the group Anatina , using as many of their systematically useful
characters as possible, in order thus to form an opinion as to how far
their representatives can be put together in groups according to true
phylogenetic relationship, and to what extent the evolution of their

the variabilities and similarities
are explained only by greater or
lesser divergence, the distribution of
most characters overlaps.

species corresponds to the type of the sheaf-form diagram with diverging
straight lines in Fig. 51. Although the sheaf of the lines of descent
can be symbolized only in three dimensions we shall have to use
several flat projections. He who is very particular about clarity
may draw them thus and then glue them together so that they fit.
1 confess that I myself used, for the arrangement of the species, a bundle
of stiff wires with thin wires representing " common characters 55
joining them together into sub-groups.
If one grants that not every species of a group of forms has de-
veloped quite by itself, independently from all others, a very different
distribution of characters is to be expected. If several forms have
only branched from one common ancestor after a long period, we can
expect that they have in common such characters as have evolved
during that time and that they differ In such characters as each

of them has developed since the time of its branching-off. If two
branches grew away from each other very far down we are not surprised
if they are connected only by very old characters common to larger
group categories. Cross-connections in character distribution, as
we have represented in Fig. 53, are not to be expected if, for the time
being, we ignore the possibility of convergence. Fig. 54 shows the type
of character distribution which is to be expected in a family tree as
opposed to the family " bush 55 represented in Fig. 53.
In species where there is reason to believe that the lack of a character
is not primitive but of secondary occurrence, this has been shown by
a little cross at the intersection of the character connection and the
line of descent. As is clear from the Table, the placing together into
groups of common origin becomes more probable the nearer we move
to the base of the sheaf of lines of descent, while for very many char-
acteristics of more recent date clear cross-connections in the distribu-
tion of characters after the manner of Fig. 53 have yet to be found.
Notice, for example, the distribution of the grunt-whistle, head-up-
tail-up, and turning-of-the-back-of-the-head.
The few morphological characters, interspersed in the Table, are to
show how similar their distribution is, in many cases, to that of
behaviour traits. After filling in those gaps, which are especially
obvious in the list of species investigated, I plan to construct a much
larger diagram, built upon the same principle, in which will be entered
all or nearly all the available morphological and behaviour characters,
such as the fertility of hybrids. The publication of this Table must
above all await the result of comparative studies of the drake's bone-
drum, which is so very rich in characters that can be compared.
Heinroth has left some unpublished material on this subject, as well as
a very complete collection of bone drums.
Even in its preliminary incomplete state our grouping shows
clearly the possibility of using the phylogenetic homology concept for
characters of inherited behaviour. This fact, which it has been the
principal task of my investigation to prove, is of the very greatest
significance in comparative psychology.
Editor's Note. --Dr. Konrad Lorenz has made a number of
alterations and additions to the translation in view of his subsequent
work on this subject since the publication of the original German
text. The Table which concludes the paper has been re-drawn.

By H. Murray (Brentwood, Essex, England)
From an avicultural point of view, the spring of 1952 opened for
me in considerable gloom if not absolute disaster. Indeed, it was
not until the autumn that my affairs began to assume a more rosy hue.
Over the years I had noticed that my strain of aviary bred British
birds had nested earlier every year, but in 1952 for some reason they
began earlier than ever before, and the middle of March saw both
Lesser Redpolls and Siskins with nests and the former with eggs.
These nests were a good eight weeks before their usual time.
As many people will remember, the end of March was accompanied
by a very heavy snowfall which caused the destruction, or brought
about the desertion, of many nests of Thrushes and Blackbirds and
other early nesting birds. I should imagine that many of the parent
birds died as well. It is certainly true that in the area in which I live,
a district in which both Thrushes and Blackbirds abound, only two
young Thrushes survived from the first round of nests.
In the aviary things were even worse, and all the Lesser Redpolls
and Siskins died, both cocks and hens, presumably killed by the cold
striking them when they were in breeding condition. By the time
I was able to catch them up and bring them in it was too late.
Curiously enough the Bourke's Parrakeets, which are generally
regarded as not completely hardy, but which had also gone to nest
early, sat closely all through the snow and hatched and reared their
young. I am fairly sure that the cock slept out in the open all through
that bitter week-end. My old hen Cockatiel also died about this
time, and the cock bird was forced to spend the summer as a very
unwiling bachelor ; but a hen seemed quite unobtainable at that
time.
By chance I had obtained a fine hen Orange-headed Ground Thrush,
and I thought that I would have a chance to breed these lovely birds,
as I already had a good cock bird, but here again my hopes were
dashed. The hen by some means best known to herself, wedged
herself into a corner of the top of the aviary, and presumably could
not get out again, and died there. I brought the cock bird in, but of
course another pair of birds had come adrift.
To crown it all, the very night that I released the small birds in the
large aviary I had a visit from owls, and lost one or two birds in night
frights. Once birds are really familiar with their surroundings owls
do not seem to disturb them, but when birds are freshly turned out
they are much more prone to panic.
Among the birds injured that night was a very fine cock Yellow-
billed Cardinal, one of a pair with which I had great hopes of breeding

this species. He damaged the top of his head, but recovered later,
although he made no attempt to breed. I had taken a corner from
my large aviary to make a quiet spot for them. Perhaps 1953 will be
more fortunate. Before leaving the subject of these Cardinals I would
like to mention that these birds have the very un-Cardinal-like habit
of hanging upside down on the roof of the aviary in the same manner
as tits.
I must confess that by the time the breeding season came round I
was strongly inclined to go in for stamp collecting or knitting, or one
of the less hazardous pastimes.
About the beginning of May I was in a dealer's shop, endeavouring
to make up my pairs of birds, when I noticed an extremely handsome
pair of small parrakeets of a kind quite unknown to me, and was
immediately keen to own them. As they were rather expensive and
I had seemed to spend a lot of money recently on birds, I decided
not to buy them but, as any aviculturist will realize, I went back a
day or so later and bought them. They were White-eared Conures,
and, I should say, a true pair.
I thought a lot of these birds, as they were bright and not too
noisy. After a few days I turned them into an aviary containing a
nest-box, and was soon very pleased to see them enter. The hen
started to sit and the cock slept in the box with her. When after six
weeks nothing had been seen or heard of the hen I became very
bothered about her, but as the cock still slept in the box I thought
that things must be going on satisfactorily. Then the cock sickened,
and I went in and looked in the box. The hen was dead and had
been for weeks, and the cock, probably owing to sleeping with the
dead bird, also passed away.
I feel that having given such a long description of my troubles, it is
only right to show a little of the other side of the balance sheet.
The Bourke's Parrakeets, as mentioned earlier in this article, had
sat throughout the snowfall. They reared three young successfully in
the first round and one in the second. These were all reared without
any bother. In my opinion the Bourke's Parrakeet is one of the most
charming and attractive of the birds known to the aviculturist. The
young are so delightfully tame and will allow themselves to be stroked
at feeding time. Also I like the way that the cock bird comes to
meet you when he has young birds to feed, and the lovely soft colourings
he shows as he flies. Their call too is quiet, and in many ways they
work their way into one's affections. I have not kept a very large
number of parrot-like birds, but one would have to go a long way
to beat a Bourke's as a friendly little pet. Unlike other people, I have
not found Grass Parrakeets safe with other birds.
In the summer of 1952 I also had considerable success with Guiana
Parrotlets. This little parrot carries no blue except on and under

the wing, the general colour being a medium green. This colour
varies over the bird and turns it into an attractive little fellow.
The hen is more yellow, particularly on the face. In the eyes of these
birds, their greatest glory seems to be the blue on the underside of
the wing. When displaying the wings are held away from the body
and the blue well displayed. It seems to be a fairly general rule
with birds that they show off their more unusual colours when courting,
even though in many cases these are not so spectacular as their
ordinary markings. The display of the white in the wing and tail of
a Chaffinch and the white rump of a Bullfinch are two cases in point.
I obtained the parent birds in the summer of 1951 and no attempt
at breeding was made in the first season. When first arrived these
birds were very wild. During the winter they were kept in a cage
in the birdroom and wintered with no bother. Their cage was
actually in the large aviary in which the small birds were wintered,
and it was a most amusing sight to watch the behaviour of an odd
cock Greenfinch that was in the flight. As the spring advanced he
came into full breeding condition, and being without a mate of his
own kind decided that the hen Parrotlet would have to do as a sub-
stitute. He spent hours against the cage trying to feed the Parrotlet
with both the cock and hen Parrotlet screaming with rage at him and
trying to grip some portion of his anatomy. Like a wise bird he kept
his feet outside or his toes would soon have paid forfeit. Mr. Enehjelm
keeps his Parrotlets with his Waxbills and other small fry, and even
breeds them in his mixed flights, but my birds seemed very warlike,
and with their powerful beaks they seem more than a match for any
normal finch.
In May the Parrotlets were let out into an aviary about 6 feet by
4 feet, containing a Budgerigar nest-box partially hidden by
a branch of gorse, and it was not long before they went to nest. The
first egg was laid about the 11 th May, and the hen sat very closely.
Apparently the cock fed the hen bird on the nest. Young were
heard on the 6th June and, as was to be expected, sounded very like
young Budgerigars. The hen continued to sit very closely, with the cock
feeding his complete family. Indeed, it was not until just before the
young flew on the 1st July that I saw the hen again.
The first brood consisted of three cocks and one hen. The young
were easily sexed as there is no immature plumage. The colours
brighten as the bird gets older.
The young Parrotlets flew on the following dates, indicating a
rather long interval between eggs for so small a bird--1st July, 3rd
July, 6th July, 9th July. All the young were perfect and differed very
little from their parents. As always with a brood of birds that one
has succeeded in rearing, the family made a pretty picture. The
whole family, both parents and youngsters, slept in a clump under

a piece of wood near the roof. The young birds commenced feeding
themselves soon after leaving the nest, and seemed particularly fond
of timothy grass thrown on the ground. I have yet to find a seed-
eating bird that does not relish this food.
Feeding the birds while the young were in the nest was fairly
straightforward. The birds' staple food of a mixture of groats, canary
seed, hemp, sunflower, and millet was given with the addition of
soaked seed and spinach stalk. The birds were really as easy to rear
as Budgerigars. Green food was a bit of a problem at first. The only
kind that the cock bird would look at at the beginning was seeding
forget-me-not. Later he ate spinach.
The hen Parrotlet started sitting again about a week after the
young left the nest, and reared another nest of young ones--two pairs
this time. I was very pleased at my success with these birds, as it
seems to be some years since they were bred, but as appears to be
the case with many parrot-like birds, once the pair decides to nest
they usually make a good job of it. The main difficulty seems to be
to get a true pair of birds in the right condition and frame of mind.
Hawfinches proved a disappointment again this year. They nested
but the hen died with laying her first egg.
Shamas also nested without result. The hen had bad egg-binding
every time she laid, and never managed to lay her eggs in the box.
The cock sang beautifully all the summer and would very willingly
have murdered any bird he could have reached. During the previous
winter the hen Shama had been given a large flight and a heated
shelter, but I am inclined to think that the trouble with egg-binding
may have been caused through her having become cold at times in the
winter. It must, however, be said that she showed no signs of distress
at all, but was always in the best of health and spirits.
An attempt was made to breed three species of Cardinals--Green,
Scarlet, and Yellow-billed, but none advanced further than nest
building. The little Pygmy Cardinal or Black-crested Finch which
I bred in 1951 would, I think, have bred again, but I only had a hen
bird. She nested and laid, but of course the eggs were clear.
Green Avadavats reared two good youngsters.
A cock Cordon-bleu paired with a hen Blue-breasted Waxbill and
reared four fine youngsters, three in the first nest and one in the
second. After their moult one of the cocks showed a faint touch of
red on the ear, but the birds undoubtedly favour the Blue-breast.
It is generally believed that a young bird obtains most of his
colouring from the cock bird, but in these youngsters the Blue-breast
is undoubtedly the dominant bird for colour. Gan this mean that
the Blue-breast is the parent stock and the Cordon-bleu a later
variation ?
These young birds were reared mainly on seed, but the parents

also ate considerable numbers of mealworms and black fly. The nests
were built in a branch of gorse and were simply a small bag of finely
woven grass. The nest was practically unlined, and appeared to be
built by the cock. He also took his turn at incubation and feeding
the youngsters, and was in fact a model parent.
Black-cheeked Waxbills also nested, and one bird sat very closely
although no eggs were laid. The nest was very similar to the Cordon
Bleu, and it seemed a pity that they did not rear youngsters as they
are such attractive birds. This particular pair have now been wintered
three times and it is hoped that in 1953 they will breed.
Live food seems to be essential for Black-cheeks, and soaked seed
is also relished, but one of the greatest treats that can be given to any
seed-eater in the winter is a seed box planted with annual grass
and chickweed and brought into the warm until it has grown up fresh
and green. All seed-eaters like this, and it cannot be otherwise than
highly beneficial to them. This particular pair of birds was exhibited
at the 1952 National Show, and I was very perturbed to see that the
hen looked very sick after the three days' show. The birds were
immediately released into the indoor aviary after their return, and
both flew at once to a pot containing cut up dates, which they ate
greedily. I am a great believer in dates for softbills and fruit-eaters
generally. Cuban Finches and Diamond Sparrows are very fond
of them also. It may be that the Black-cheeked Waxbill needs a sweet
fruit of this nature to keep it in condition. My experience with these
birds has been similar to the general run ; very easy to keep in the
summer out of doors, but prone to enteritis and sudden death when
brought in for the winter.
Nests were built on the ground within a few feet of one another by
both Red-eared Waxbills and St. Helena Waxbills. As the nests were
on the edge of a tiny bank near the side of the aviary it was reasonably
easy to keep them under observation. It is well known that the
St. Helena is one of the more easily bred Waxbills, while the number
of successful rearings of Red-ears can be counted on one's fingers.
Why this should be I cannot see, as Red-ears have nested and
laid with me every year, but they seem to desert before the eggs hatch.
I have always considered that this is due to having more than one pair
of the birds together. When one considers the hundreds of thousands
of these birds that have been imported and kept under all sorts of
conditions over the last century this lack of breeding success becomes
even more curious. I was therefore very interested in watching the
activities of these birds. The nest was the usual rough ball of woven
grass with the entrance at ground level and covered with a tiny porch.
The cock built his little half open nest on the top, and the whole edifice
was covered by a clump of milk thistle. Several of the large leaves
of this plant were either hanging down over the nest or lying on the

ground. It was pretty to watch them go to roost at night. The hen
had a special route that she always followed. This track started about
two feet from the nest and led through the stems of the milk thistle,
reaching the ground about a foot from the nest. She then crawled
and wriggled her way under the leaves lying on the ground until she
could slip into her nest. The cock did not bother so much about con-
cealment, but flew down to his nest. I was both interested and
surprised to see that the cock and hen did not sleep together in the
proper nest, the cock keeping to his upstair bedroom.
The nest of Red-ears went the usual way, but with the St. Helenas
things were more satisfactory. Their nest was a few feet from the
other one, but appeared to be the same except for the cock's nest on
top. As usual with Waxbills, I had no certain knowledge that there
were any young, until after about six weeks from first sitting a fine
youngster flew. He was a cock with ear patches and a rosy tint on
the abdomen. He was a fine large bird. Greatly to my surprise two
other youngsters flew at the same time and apparently from the same
brood. They were small brown birds with no trace of any red about
them. The parent St. Helenas fed all three birds, so presumably
they flew together. It was the wide difference in the birds that
surprised me--one bird a true St. Helena in full colour, and these two
much smaller birds with no red at all. No colours appeared at all
until the moult, and then the birds, after appearing to be Red-ears,
turned into a sort of cross between a Red-ear and a St. Helena. I still
have these birds and shall try and breed with them this year. At the
beginning I thought that the Red-ears had laid in the other nest,
were in fact partly parasitic. This would account in part for the small
number of successful breedings of this species, but I now think that
the youngsters were hybrids. I had proof last year that this can
happen when from one nest of Linnets I reared two Linnets and two
Redpoll-Linnet hybrids. This time I think I have one true St. Helena
and two hybrids. Perhaps someone who has bred St. Helenas before
may be persuaded to give details of immature plumage. It may be
that hen birds do not assume adult colour until the moult, while the
cock birds fly from the nest with full colours. I find this hard to
believe, but would be pleased to hear more about it.
Black-chinned Yuhinas provided another near miss. I had had
these birds for two years and had never considered them a true pair.
No sign of any display was ever seen, although the birds were always
together and seemed very fond of one another. Even a separation of
a few feet was sufficient to make them call constantly. They com-
menced nesting in early May, and constructed a half-roofed nest in
a wire cylinder. Four eggs were laid of a dull browny-green colour
with darker markings. The nest was built with strands of opened
string and lined with wool. The birds certainly behaved like a true

pair, and relieved one another regularly at the nest. Also I believe
that one bird slept in the shelter. After about a week both birds
were seen to be sitting together, and I became convinced that they
were both hens. After a time I took the old nest away and both
birds built separate nests, but no more eggs were laid. It was a pity
that they did not breed, as I understand that they have never been
bred in England so far.
Ruficauda Finches started the season badly, but finished a little
better. In the spring I had two of these birds that I thought were a
true pair, but the " cock " turned out to be a hen, and the two birds
then built a joint nest, laid ten eggs between them, and spent some
months happily brooding clear eggs. About the beginning of August
I learned that Mr. Vane had some spare cock birds, of which I procured
two and turned them into the large aviary with the hens, first taking
away their old nest. Although the cock birds seemed interested
enough in the hens, the two old ladies, doubtless considering that
they got along very comfortably without the complications arising
from marriage, decided to stick together and built another nest in
which they laid seven eggs which they commenced to brood. A cock
bird approaching the nest was a signal that brought an amazon forth
to drive him away. The male birds looked rather foolish having to
sing and display at a safe distance.
I myself took a rather dim view of this ultra-militant feminism, as
I naturally thought that all the eggs would be clear, but the birds
did not take the matter to extremes, and in due course all seven eggs
hatched. Even when the young were in the nest the cock birds were
never allowed near them or to feed them. Owing to the very wet
weather only two young birds were reared. It may perhaps be
as well to mention that I have proved that both of the hens are in
fact true hens. Both have been egg-bound !
In conclusion I would like to put on record a very unusual occurrence ;
in fact it comes nearer to thought as we understand it than anything
else that I have observed myself. The interpretation of the facts will
probably differ, but the truth and accuracy of them are absolutely
guaranteed.
Many of our members have bred Cuban Finches, indeed these
pretty little birds are nearly as easy to breed as Zebra Finches as long
as they have an aviary with no other birds of their species with them.
The cocks fight furiously among themselves, sometimes to the death,
but with other birds they are peaceful and friendly.
As their name implies, they come from a very warm climate ; indeed
so little do they bother about the weather that their nest, a small
bottle affair usually fixed to the outside of a gorse branch, and not
built in its shelter, is so thin that the sky can be seen through the roof
and the sitting birds and eggs through the base. As another instance

of their being accustomed to extreme heat, they do not brood the
eggs in the same way that a normal bird does, but only return to
the nest for about five minutes in the hour. Indeed the only way that
one can be sure of eggs, apart from an examination, is to notice that
the adult Cubans keep a very close watch on the nest, any other bird
going near being immediately driven off.
My pair of Cubans consisted of a cock bird that I had bred the year
before and a newly imported hen. No attempt was made to nest
until well into August, and it was not until the 31st that I heard the
youngsters being fed.
As some of my readers may remember, the week-end of the 6th~7th
September was accompanied by a very heavy frost. On the morning
of Saturday the 6th I went to the aviary expecting to find the parent
birds had deserted the nest and the youngsters dead. This is the usual
happening with all birds, both British and foreign, when struck by an
unexpected frost. To my surprise when I approached the aviary I found
both of the parent Cubans frantically pulling wool out of old nests
and carrying it back to their own. This was then taken inside, roughly
placed in position by the beak, and the bird then stood under it and
placing its shoulders under the wool it stood up on its toes and forced
it into position with its back. All Saturday the birds worked furiously,
and all Sunday as well. The young were fed at odd times and screamed
constantly for food, but the parents paid little attention to them, but
carried on with their work. By Sunday evening the nest, which on
Friday had been the size of a man's first, was as large as a football.
A great mass of loosely held together wool with the sides about three
inches thick. On Monday night it rained and the nest was washed
half away from the branch. On Tuesday and Wednesday the young
flew, and more rain on Thursday brought the whole nest to the
ground. Two out of the three young were reared, and I still have
them.
This incident raises several interesting queries. How did these tiny
birds, with no possible race memory of frost, know how to react
correctly to the danger ? Perhaps some of our members have had
similar experiences or have noticed the behaviour of these birds in the
West Indies. Being in the wool trade I prefer to think that even
Cubans can read advertisements, and that they believe " that there is
no substitute ..."

By David M. Johnson (Washington, D.G., U.S.A.)
The article contributed by me about a year ago to the Magazine
appears to have aroused great interest, and I have received many
letters of inquiry. It gives me great pleasure to share with my fellow
members of the Society the results of my further research into this most
interesting subject. I have even had a Kodacolour print made of a
painting I have done of some of these hybrids.
It would seem that this question of Sonnerat hybrids has not
hitherto received the attention it deserves. I have seen a list of at least
seven books in which reference has been made to the contribution made
by Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl to any breed of domestic poultry and all
deny any such contribution or any relationship. One of these books
goes so far as to say : " The resemblance between this Grey Jungle
Fowl and the domestic is great, and it was believed that this would
prove to be the ancestor of the domestic fowl. This is not the case,
however ; the two species do not cross, or if they did interbreed, the
hybrids of this cross are sterile." I may say that it is not my opinion
that the Grey Jungle Fowl resembles the domestic fowl in appearance,
and my own researches show that hybrids are not always sterile.
There is another reference in an old British book. Dr. Danforth, of
Stanford University, who has done extensive pheasant research in
genetics and intergeneric as well as interspecies crosses in pheasants,
has kindly sent me his papers and a reference in an old British book to
a Grey Jungle Fowl running free with bantams in England, crossing
with them, but the offspring were finally absorbed in the bantams.
This was in the year 1870.
It seems strange that Man has treated so lightly, even indifferently,
a subject which is so related to Game Birds and also to poultry, in its
many phases of interest and study.
The records of our Society seem brief and incomplete in this
particular subject, and I am happy to be able to contribute my
findings. By autumn I hope to report my findings in my research on
three-quarter Sonnerat's cockerels and Cornish Indian Game Bantams.
I have referred to a picture I painted of Sonnerat's hybrids, and if it
is not possible to publish it in the Magazine perhaps it could be
retained in the records of the Society, so that any member who wished
to see it could do so. At the time I painted this picture the cockerels
were under a year old and the feet and legs were then yellow. But at
a year old the feet and legs turned red, as in their sire, the cock sonneratii,
and while the cock bird superficially resembles the Red Jungle Fowl
(Gallus gallus), the chest would indicate sonneratii , as well as the under-
glow. The shape of the feathers, too, resembles sonneratii , but the comb

takes after the mother's side, the Gallus gallus. The hen hybrids are,
however, so like the Grey Jungle Fowl hens that it would take an
expert to distinguish them. In their voices and calls the hybrids more
resemble sonneratii, which differs from Gallus gallus in this respect. The
hybrids do not seem to prefer domestication as do the Red Jungle Fowl.
I will now comment briefly on the three-quarter Sonneratii hybrids,
with which I propose to deal more thoroughly at a later date.
These birds were the produce of five-month-old cockerel sonneratii
hybrids and an old hen sonneratii. They were hatched in September
and the clutch were ioo per cent fertile. They grew up in adverse
weather conditions and during a winter of almost continuous rain and
frost. Their hardihood was astounding. One three-quarter hybrid
pullet refused to be weaned but is nevertheless this year assisting its
mother in incubating. She looks exactly like a sonneratii. The two
brothers, three-quarter sonneratii , resemble a Grey Jungle cock in
appearance, especially one of them which has almost no comb. I have
provided these with a Cornish Game Bantam as mate and they are
compatible. I have chosen the Cornish Bantam for two reasons. One
reason is they have no superfluous comb and wattles and the other
reason is that some experts believe that the Indian Game Fowl itself
is something other than Gallus gallus , which prompts me to research
along these lines. I have found the three-quarter sonneratii hybrid to
be inherently wild. They seem to think of nothing but eventual escape,
even more than the pure wild Grey Jungle Fowl, which will settle down
somewhat. These hybrids are highly prolific, producing an abundance
of eggs, as in poultry, and the maternal instinct is strong. Egg-laying
is not strictly seasonal, as in sonneratii , and the cock bird is in
season at all times. This is not so in the sonneratii cock, at least, as its
breeding season is strictly in spring and again in autumn. Its repro-
ductive qualities go into eclipse with the summer moult.
I have been impressed with the apparent potentialities of the hybrids,
in their varying degrees, as offering possibilities as a game bird if a
suitable habitat can be worked out. This, of course, should be done by
a system of trial and error by the younger generation of aviculturists.
There seems much promise here for the covert. The food of sonneratii
and its hybrids should be easily found. It seems to consist more of
living creatures, such as insects and worms, and its demands on a grain
diet are less than the other species of Gallus. Its alertness, virility, and
intelligence seem remarkable.
It is to be hoped that others will carry on this work, so that this bird
of unlimited energy and virility may be established in parks, estates,
and preserves.

HOODED COCK AND MANY-COLOUR
HEN HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992054219512195" page_id="56291867"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
By Professor E. Sprawson (Kenley, Surrey, England)
I was very much interested in the final paragraph of " News and
Views 55 on page 70 of the March-April issue of the Avicultural
Magazine, concerning the breeding of hybrids from Hooded cock and
Many-colour hen Parrakeets, and their great likeness to the Paradise
Parrakeet.
Though neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, I have for many
years thought that this would be so, and there were several reasons
which led me to think so, as follows :--
The areas occupied by the Hooded and Many-colour (illustrated in
Neville Cayley's Australian Parrots ) might well, on occasion, overlap on
the western border of Queensland ; and that occupied by the Paradise
Parrakeet actually does overlap that of the Many-colour in Southern
Queensland, so that opportunity for the occurrence of natural
hybridization may be said to be present. (It also seems well within the
range of possibility for the Golden-shouldered to overlap and hybridize
with the Many-colour.)
The differing nesting sites do not, I think, count for a great deal.
I have had Hooded Parrakeets dig a hole and nest in an ant-hill here
in Surrey (Mr. Boosey published the photograph), I have also had them
nest in the ordinary parrakeet nest-box, such as was used by Many-
colours ; and did not Canon Dutton record that his Paradise Parrakeets
attempted to burrow into the wall of a room--presumably to nest ?--
though he did not say how high above the floor level they burrowed,
but only that had they gone in they would have got into a loft--and
yet it is also known as the " Ant-hill " Parrakeet. Cayley also records
the wild Paradise as occasionally nesting in holes in trees and stumps.
Colour and colour distribution. It is an old saying concerning
hybrids--and with some truth in it--that they are " coloured like
father and shaped like mother ". Shape hardly comes into account
here, as both Hooded and Many-colour are very graceful birds and of
not dissimilar shape, though the Hooded is rather slimmer. The
Paradise, which I have never seen alive, appears to be slim also in the
photograph in Cayley's book.
The Hooded father would give the black cap to the hybrid--but
lessened in area (as in the Paradise).
The crimson patch on the wing I would expect in such a hybrid ;
the Many-colour hen has a small red wing patch and the wing patches
of the young males as they leave the nest are considerably redder than
are those of adult males--which looks as if the yellow patches of the
adult males were a later evolutionary production ; the red wing-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993690755555556" page_id="56291868"  page_num="103" year="" vol="">
patch in the hybrid might then well be a reversion to an ancestral
colour. The coloured wing-patch in the Paradise, too, is in size between
those of the Hooded and Many-colour males.
The Hooded father would also give the turquoise blue to the rump
and upper tail coverts, and the brown to the back. The red colour of
the patch on the cock Many-colour's nape might well be transferred to
the frontal band on the forehead of the hybrid (as in the Paradise) ;
besides, the frontal band in the hen Many-colour is often reddish, and
that, too, might influence the production of a red frontal band in the
hybrid.
To my mind, some other hybrids which were bred some years ago
by Mr. Boosey : Red Rump x Hooded, and Brown's X Red (Eastern)
Rosella, and which were of great interest, tended to confirm these
views, and I then put forward my view that the Hooded cock x Many-
colour hen hybrid ought to be almost exactly like the Paradise--
hoping that Mr. Boosey would be able to produce it if I could not
myself--we both had Hoodeds and Many-colours in those days.
One thing, however, puzzled me extremely : the Brown's X Red
(Eastern) Rosella hybrid was at first sight a Brown's with a deep blood-
red cap instead of a black one--and a very beautiful bird ; now Gould
records of Brown's : "I have one specimen also with the whole of the
crown of the head a deep blood-red and others with more or less of this
colour," though he regarded it as unusual, but he does mention the
occasional occurrence of a band across the forehead--which Cayley
also mentions. I believe no one since has ever seen such a specimen
as Gould here records, yet Mr. Boosey produces an exact replica by
hybridization, and the distribution areas of Brown's and the Red
(Eastern) Rosella are almost at the opposite ends of Australia !
Presumably Gould's bird could not have been a hybrid--or at any
rate a recent one, though perhaps a throw-back to one in a very remote
past, when their areas of distribution were not so widely separated.
Without going into detail there are, in many groups of Australian
parrakeets, considerable variations within the range of normal with
regard to colour, quite a number of which are grouped as sub-
species. So also with broods of apparently normal birds : I have seen
them vary considerably even in the same nest, showing I suppose, that
although the parents are apparently of the same type their blood must
have been mixed with that of some of their adjacent sub-species.
Indeed, the evolution in colour in many Australian parrakeets appears
to be in a very fluid state, and such that if one could isolate certain
types, new sub-species might almost be produced at will.
If then the Paradise originated as a fertile hybrid, such variation
might account for any differences that may be found between the
hybrids Sir Edward Hallstrom has produced and the naturally wild
species--if, indeed, there are any.

Apart from producing imitations of known species by means of
hybridization I have often thought that the hens of the more colourful
varieties of Bluebonnet might give wonderful potentialities for the
production of new colour schemes with male Hoodeds and Many-
colours, but so far I do not think many hybrids have been bred with
the Bluebonnet. I am not really fond of hybrids but think we may
have a lot to learn from them, particularly if they turn out to be fertile.
I hope Mr. Turner will keep us fully informed as to the progress of
these hybrids and if they prove fertile, and may I suggest that Sir
Edward Hallstrom try the Golden-shoulder cock X Many-colour hen
hybrid also, and tell us all about both sets of hybrids from time to
time, ultimately perhaps with coloured illustrations. Please do, Sir
Edward--they are all such beautiful creations and we should be so
grateful to know if another species (?), namely the Paradise, could have
been produced by natural hybridization in the past--as well as by
artificial hybridization in the present.

The whole of one side of the Tropical House has been furnished with
tropical plants, including orchids, and is now devoted to Humming-
birds of which twenty-two specimens of six forms arrived some five
weeks ago.
The Golden-throated ( Polytmus guainumbi thaumantias) and the
Red-throated Sapphire ( Hylocharis sapphirina) are new to the collec-
tion ; the remainder consist of Waterton's Wood Nymph ( Thalurania
watertoni) ; Pucheran's Emerald ( Chlorostilbon aureoventris pucherani) ;
Blue-breasted Sapphire ( Chlorestes notatus), and another not yet
identified which might be immature Amazilia leucogaster.
These birds are being fed on the liquid diet recommended by
M. Cordier and plenty of fruit flies. The fateful forty days of
which M. Cordier writes have almost passed and there have been no
losses so far. This happy state could be attributed as much to the
perfect condition of the birds on arrival--due to some excellent
packing and to air travel--and to the amount of exercise they are
able to take in this large flight as to the food they have received here.
Two Sunbirds new to the collection have been received from
Messrs. Seago and Bloom ; they are the Nandi Double-collared
(Cinnyris reichenowi) and the Uganda Olive-bellied (C. chloropygius
orphogaster) ; also four of the Sudan Beautiful Sunbird ( Nectarinia
pulchella lucidipectus) and a single Uganda Green White-eye (Zosterops
virens stuhlmanni).
An Active Parrot ( Amazona agilis) and a Red-throated (A. collaria)
were brought from Jamaica and presented by Lieut.-Col. Legard.
It appears that these two Parrots are not uncommon in certain parts
of the island.
Other presentations include an African Sea-Eagle ( Cuncuma vocifer) ;
three Silver Pheasants ; a Tropical Seed Finch ; a Guttural Finch ;
a Nepal Hill Myna ; a Festive Parrot ; a Pennant's, a Black-tailed,
and a Quaker Parrakeet.
A number of the Owls have laid, but unfortunately many of them
are without mates and only the Great Eagle-Owls have young ones.
The other Eagle-Owls that have laid are the Turkestan, the Fraser's,
the Cape, and the Abyssinian Spotted. Both the Spectacled have
eggs, and the Ceylon Fish Owls have laid a second clutch.
Greenland White-fronted, Upland Geese, Egyptian, Canada and
Grey Lag have eggs ; also New Zealand (second clutch) and Common
Sheld-Duck, as well as the usual Carolina and Red-crested Pochard.
The Choughs are sitting on six eggs and Pheasants, including
Temminck's and Swinhoe's, have laid, as have Magellan Penguins
and a Gannet. A further three Black-footed Penguins have been bred.

Miss Katharine Tousey, of the Massachusetts Audubon Society,
showed the film Audubon&amp;apos;s America. While, perhaps primarily intended
for showing to ornithologists, it nevertheless contained much of very
considerable interest to aviculturists generally. The film, the joint
effort of a dozen or so photographers, gives a very good idea of the
country through which Audubon made his journeys, pioneer from
the ornithological point, and shows many of the birds he depicted in
his monumental The Birds of America.
Miss Tousey not only gave a running commentary, but showed her
versatility by imitating the call of many of the birds shown. Members
are indebted to Miss Tousey for the opportunity of seeing a very
informative film.

The year 1954 marks the Diamond Jubilee of the Avicultural
Society. The Society's Golden Jubilee in 1944 could not, unfortu-
nately, be celebrated owing to the war ; the occasion was, however,
marked by a special Jubilee Supplement of the Avicultural
Magazine.
The President and Council feel that the forthcoming Jubilee should
be commemorated in a manner worthy of the Society. It has, there-
fore, been decided to hold an Avicultural Congress in London,
i6th-igth June, 1954.
Invitations to attend are being sent to prominent aviculturists
throughout the world.
During the four days of the Congress there will be visits to the
principal collections, papers will be read, and lunches and dinners
arranged.
This preliminary notice is being given at such an early date in the
hope that as many members as possible will arrange to be present and
give their support to an event certain to add greatly to the Society's
prestige.

The smuggling of birds into the United States appears to be greatly
on the increase.
A U.S. attorney has expressed the belief that bird smugglers are
now doing a larger business than narcotics smugglers. A member of
the federal legal staff has said that virtually all the " quality 55 parrots
and parrakeets are smuggled into the U.S. through Mexico.
The arrest has recently been announced of three persons said to be
members of an international smuggling ring, "in a million dollar
operation handling 70,000 birds annually. 55 The three were released
on $5,000 bail each at their appearance before the U.S. Commissioner
on charges of conspiring to smuggle tropical birds.
The authorities are determined to prevent illegal importations.
Considerable prominence is given in the Press to prosecutions and a
few recent captions are : " Customs Agents seize 1,100 Birds 55 from
two smugglers ; " Smuggler sentenced to 6 months for smuggling
304 birds from Mexico 55 ; " Parrot-smuggler draws $500.00 fine
on charges of smuggling more than 600 parrots into the United
States. 55
There is a total commercial ban on psittacines, and legally only
not-for-sale pets are allowed to be imported. Persons who have been
outside the U.S. for more than four months are allowed to take in two
such birds each year, provided they have been in their possession the
whole of that time.

OISEAUX DE CAGE. By M. Legendre, with illustrations by

<bodyText confidence="0.935192147058823" page_id="56291877"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
L. Delapchier. Editions N. Boubee &amp; Cie, Paris, 1952. Price
1,200 francs.
Since the second edition of Les Oiseaux by J. Delacour and
M. Legendre, which was published in 1934 and quickly sold out, no
book on aviculture has been published in France. The manual
under review is therefore long overdue and will be greatly welcomed,
particularly by French-speaking aviculturists. As the author states
in his preface, in order that the book may be included in the special
series published by Messrs. N. Boubee, and space is limited, only the
Passeriformes and some families belonging to nearly related orders are
dealt with. Parrots and Doves are not included and the author states
that he hopes to deal with them in a later volume. The collection,
which forms a very diverse group from the avicultural point of view,
contains the species most popular as cage or aviary birds and those
which are of particular interest to aviculturists rather than those
which are rarely imported.
The book is divided into sections, the first containing general remarks
on keeping birds in captivity, and this is followed by chapters on
cages, food, rearing of young birds taken from the nest, mutations,
and illnesses and diseases. After this various species are dealt with
individually, a short description of plumage, etc., being given, with
notes on the birds' adaptability to captivity. The book concludes with
a summary of the most important points which must be regarded
when keeping birds in captivity, a full bibliography and an index to
all species under both the popular and scientific names.
The book is profusely illustrated with 12 colour plates, depicting
79 species, 53 black and white drawings, and 7 tail pieces by
L. Delapchier. In addition there are 12 half-tone plates which
include some very interesting photographs of cages varying from
the " cages de luxe " of Japan to a cage for a blinded Chaffinch.
Monsieur Legendre has a vast and detailed experience in keeping
birds and the book is full of most valuable information. A foreword
is contributed by Professor J. Berlioz.

Cage Birds. London, 1953. Price icw. 6 d. net.
Whilst the title to this book is most apt it is inclined to give the
impression that this is a re-hash of a very old work, which it most
certainly is not. It may be fairly stated, without fear of contradiction,
that no treatise on this subject has previously dealt with the matter so
concisely, clearly, and in such an interesting manner.
Every reader should peruse the preface carefully, it contains some
very useful axioms. Many experienced bird-keepers may well differ
with some of Mr. Risdon's remarks, but if they apply common sense
and allow for individuality in birds, as suggested in his preface, they
will find no cause for real disagreement. It is a book for all bird-
keepers and should be in every aviculturist's collection.
The coloured plates are most helpful to identification, if not of great
artistic worth, but they fulfil their immediate purpose admirably. It is
unfortunate that the wrapper portrays non-existent gems of aviculture,
as this may well result in more knowledgeable bird-keepers jumping to
the conclusion that it is written by someone not well acquainted with
the subject. To those people therefore may I say : " Don't be put off."

Parrots in Captivity
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981022142857143" page_id="56291878"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
Listed in the Bibliography of Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity is the classic work,
" Greene, Dr. W. T., Parrots in Captivity , 4 vols. (1884-88)."
A correspondent queries the correctness of the number of volumes. It may,
therefore, be of interest to those in possession of this work if the position is clarified.
Parrots in Captivity appeared first in parts, of which parts 1 to 18 formed volumes i
and ii. Volume iii consisted of parts 19 to 27, and half of part 28. The remainder
of part 28, with parts 29 and 30 formed an unfinished volume iv, now extremely
scarce. Messrs. Wheldon and Wesley, Ltd., recently had a set in parts pass through
their hands, and I am indebted to them for this information. Volume iv consists of
36 pages with chapters and coloured plates of birds described as the Ceram or
Chattering Lory, Red Lory, Reticulated or Blue-streaked Lory, Scaly-breasted
Lorikeet, Malaccan or Long-tailed Parrakeet, and Malabar Parrakeet ; together
with plates of Stanley's Parrakeet, African or Rose-ringed Parrakeet, and Horned
Parrakeet.
There is a four volume set in the Library of the Zoological Society of London.

Breeding of Rock Bunting (Fringillaria tahapisi tahapisi) in South Africa.
A querist correspondent of mine, Mr. R. G. Atkin, of Plumstead, Cape Province,
South Africa, informs me that he has bred Fringillaria tahapisi tahapisi the Rock
Bunting or Klip-mossie. They nested in a hanging basket containing hay, suspended
about three feet from the ground. Three bluish eggs heavily marked with reddish-
brown were deposited. Eggs were laid 22nd February, 1953, young hatched 7th
and 8th March, 1953. Eyes were open 15th March, 1953, and the three young left
the nest on 20th and 31st March. Although strong on the wing they kept much to
the ground. Further young were hatched 8th April, 1953. In addition to their
seed, bread and milk, mealworms, and termites available in quantity were supplied,
and also seeding grasses. There seems to be no previous record of breeding of this
particular species.

BREEDING OF GREY PARROTS IN INDIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932590535714285" page_id="56291879"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
It must be a great many years ago now that I was told about the Grey Parrots in
India, and I am very interested to hear that it was Sir Godfrey Davis who told me.
All I remembered--and I must confess that as I get older my memory gets worse
and worse !--was that a gentleman who had spent some years in India came to
visit our farm, and said that he had been told of someone in India who had such a
prolific pair of Greys that he, as it were, hardly knew what to do with the young ones.
As I knew from experience how difficult it is even to mate a pair of Greys success-
fully, let alone to breed from them, I was naturally sceptical--the more so because,
in my experience, Greys go in for very small clutches of two or three eggs and the
young spend a very long time indeed in the nest, so one would be most unlikely
ever to have a glut of them.
I am not sure to which article of mine Sir Godfrey refers, but if, in it, I gave the
impression that I thought the story was simply an invention on his part, I must have
expressed myself very badly, and hasten to apologize for--as the newspapers say--
any inconvenience it may have caused him !
Incidentally, I should not have said that being a bad judge of character was
among my many failings, and if I have become a particularly " disbelieving fellow ",
it may well be because my credulity has been sometimes strained to breaking point
by--to give but one example--some visitor or other to our farm who solemnly assured
me that they had heard of someone who had high hopes of breeding red Canaries,
as they had recently bred a brood of Firefinch x Canary hybrids ! Naturally I
assumed that I was intended to treat this as a great joke, until I realized that my
informant took it quite seriously !

THE PROBLEM OF THIRD BROODS OF PARRAKEETS
My objection to the Duke of Bedford's two suggested methods of preventing a hen
Turquoisine from having three nests is that both tend to risk the second brood, in
order to make sure that there shall not be a third. There is, for instance, always the
chance that a hen, suddenly left to finish off the rearing of her brood single-handed,
may tire of her task and either give them insufficient food or stop feeding them
altogether.
The Duke's second method entails doing the very thing I always avoid if I possibly
can--namely taking away the young ones before they are fully independent of their
parents. Occasionally, if the parents start moulting and neglect them, one is forced
to do this, and the young have to learn to feed themselves as best they can, but I
would never do it unless I was left with no alternative. Then, too, they have first
to be caught up, and to do this the Duke recommends that one " should go in and
net the whole brood as quickly as you can before they have time to do themselves
serious damage " to which--knowing how wildly young Turquoisines batter about
if one so much as approaches their aviary--I can only say, with the late Dr. Joad,
it all depends what you mean by serious damage !
The Duke asks if I can say how many hens I have lost before they put up the old
hen's satisfactory record, and if he means, as presumably he does, how many have
I lost through letting them over-breed--the answer is quite definitely none ; if
only because all the other hen Turqoisines I have kept were apparently staunch
believers in a particularly rigid form of birth-control !
I cannot say how many of the young of the third broods have matured into good
breeding stock, because those we kept for breeding purposes were among the first
young ones the old pair ever reared here, but I can truthfully say that, not in one
single instance was there any sign whatever of weakness or degeneracy among the
third broods.

By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
After nearly twelve years of life in New York City, on the 16th floor
of a Fifth Avenue building, I have moved to California as Director
of the Department of History, Science and Art of the County of Los
Angeles. A main change in my life has resulted from the mildness of
the climate and the consequent possibility of keeping outdoors, with
little trouble, a number of semi-tropical, or tropical, plants and birds.
Last summer I bought a small house in one of the many charming
residential sections of this unusual city, which is really a collection
of suburban towns. Its tree-lined avenues and gardens make it
country-like and attractive. The rare advantage of my new house
is that the garden at the back (the back-yard, as it is called in America)
is crossed by a small natural stream, running all the year round at the
same speed, notwithstanding the six months of dry weather which
Southern California enjoys (more or less !) between May and October.
Such permanent streams are as rare here as they are on the Riviera.
The garden, 300 feet deep, is cut by a deep ravine which has been
skilfully laid out as a rock garden, with a long Japanese bridge crossing
it. Near the house I have made a pond for lotus and blue water-lilies,
and the sunny far end of the garden has been reserved for cacti and
succulents. The rest is nicely shaded by trees, full of camellias and
azaleas. I have added many species of forest palms, ferns, aroids,
bromiliads, orchids, and other interesting plants. It looks like a large
conservatory.
I had, of course, to keep birds. Possibilities, however, were limited.
I did not want to spoil the garden, and in town, noisy things, which
might bother neighbours, are not allowed. At the north side of the
garden, by the house, is a garage which I promptly turned into a
bird house. Nearby, a large window of the sitting-room looked on to
a narrow (10 feet) passage of drab bricks. This was transformed into

an aviary, partly covered with transparent plastic, partly with a
half-inch wire netting roof. It is 12 feet high, 24 feet long, and
including the slice of the garage used as a shelter, 20 feet wide.
Properly laid out and planted it looks really charming, and birds do
well in it. Along the fence, on the north side, there is a full partition
up to 6 feet, and a shelter is provided at the top by a vertical 18 inch
wide strip of plastic with another one of the same width on the roof
of the aviary. No heating is necessary, as frost does not occur there.
This first aviary has a population of finches, one or two pairs each of
most of the Australian species ; Lavenders, Ruddies, and Cordon-
bleus i Avadavats ; Auroras ; Rainbow Buntings ; Red Hooded
Siskins ; Pintail Nonpareils, etc., about sixty altogether. There are
also pairs of Painted Quails, Mountain Witch, Bartlett's, Silver
Diamond, Talpacoti, and Pigmy Doves ; a Shama ; Giant Whydahs ;
a pair of Bourke's Parrakeets, and a few Sugar Birds. When the
housekeeper, who takes my place in the care of the birds when I travel,
has sufficient experience, more difficult birds will be added, such as
small Tanagers and Sunbirds. As the garden is usually occupied by
wild Humming-birds, it is not necessary to keep any in confinement
where space is very limited. It is a constant delight to watch the birds
from the window which constitutes a useful observation post.
Along the fence following this first aviary is a similar one, 28 feet
long, 10 feet wide. It contains a pair of Palawan Peacock-Pheasants ;
pairs of Harlequin Quails, Bleeding-heart, Ashy and Diamond Doves,
Diamond Sparrows, Australian Crimson Finches, several varieties of
Zebra Finches, Red-crested Finches, Cuban Finches, Indian White-
eyes, and a European Song Thrush.
There was an obvious location for another aviary between the
bridge and the solid fence on the south side of the garden. It was only
a question of roofing over the space between the wall and the bridge,
and of building wire partitions under the bridge and on the sides.
The result is a large flight, 50 feet and 20 feet, very high in the centre
over the stream which flows in a deep gully. I keep there a few small
ducks and teal, Mandarins, Puna and Sharp-winged Teal, Maned
Geese, Lesser Indian Whistling-Ducks ; some doves : Brush Bronze-
wings, Cassin's, Peruvian Ground, Green-winged, Chiriqui Ground-
Pigeons, and a few other birds such as Pekin Robins, Orange-headed
Thrush, Spectacled Jay-Thrushes, a European Blackbird, Dyal Bird,
Tricoloured Spreos, and Purple-headed Glossy Starlings.
These Californian aviaries are few in number and small in size
compared to those at Cleres and, in the long past, at Villers. But they
are suited to the present circumstances and very attractive, giving
me much pleasure. At past sixty I am just as thrilled as ever by
watching my birds, and I still enjoy caring for them as I did when I
was ten years old. Bird lovers are incorrigible, I am afraid.

BUDGERIGARS AT LIBERTY IN DEVON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989078119047619" page_id="56291890"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Bedfordshire, England)
The homing budgerigars at Endsleigh, near Tavistock, have now
entered on their second season and are doing well, losses during the
winter having been few. The foundation stock consisted of a few pairs
of homers from Woburn and purchased untrained birds from two or
three different sources. Of the purchased birds five cocks and three
hens still remain, the rest of the flock, about sixty altogether, being
made up of homing birds from Woburn and young bred in the aviary.
As is usual, the non-homing foundation birds have not given a par-
ticularly good account of themselves and of those that remain only
a cock and a hen go in and out of the aviary with any regularity,
the remainder behaving as 44 non-exits ", i.e. birds which do not go
out at all. I am finding also that for flying at liberty the modern
show type of budgerigar is not so good as a more slender, active, long-
winged bird which would not satisfy the judges. The show budgerigar
is not only apt to be slow-witted, but also slow in flight and, if it should
go out, is more liable to fall a prey to Sparrowhawks which in this
district are very abundant.
As at the beginning of the season I had more cocks than hens in the
aviary, I sent down some spare homing hens from Woburn, intending
to have two breeding teams in succession. The reason for this was that
I had discovered that on no account must the 44 breeding atmosphere "
of an aviary be upset by returning to the 4 4 resting " aviary, in the
middle of the summer, all hens that have reared two broods, in order
to prevent overbreeding. I had hoped to turn half the hens from the
resting aviary into the liberty aviary about 15th February, and the
remainder at the end of June when the first lot were returned to the
resting aviary after rearing two broods. The plan, however, did not
work out very satisfactorily either here or at Woburn as, although
the majority of the unmated cocks did not interfere unduly with the
breeding pairs, a few were very troublesome. In order to secure the
double aim of maintaining the breeding atmosphere in the aviary until
autumn while at the same time preventing individual pairs from
overworking themselves, I have now limited, in the case of the adult
birds, not the number of broods but the number of eggs they are
allowed to hatch, and this plan promises to work extremely well.
Those pairs which have reared two full broods, are only allowed
to hatch a couple of eggs in any subsequent clutches they may lay
before the end of the season. The rearing of two young is not a serious
strain on any hen budgerigar who has a mate to help her. Indeed,
I think she keeps just as healthy and happy when so engaged as when
condemned to a life of unnatural boredom in the hens' resting aviary.

Seeing that things were not going too well on the " double-shift "
plan, I decided to take the risk, in mid-May, of adding to the breeding
and liberty aviary nearly all the hens left in the resting aviary. Usually
it is inadvisable to introduce new hens where others are breeding, as
fighting and disturbance are very likely, but in this case fortunately
the new hens, most of which were in heavy moult when put in caused
no serious trouble. This, however, can hardly be said to have been
due to the fact that, being in moult, they were not in breeding condition
for, as always happens if you put moulting, albeit healthy hens in an
aviary where breeding is going on, they immediately stopped moulting
and started to take an interest in the nest-boxes, laying but very
little later than those which are not in moult. It is, of course, well
known that budgerigars, like other birds which nest in colonies, are,
for some strange reason quite unconnected with physical health,
much stimulated to nest by the presence of companions. My own
view is that a hen budgerigar who would be slow to nest if kept in
an aviary alone with her mate, goes to nest readily in an aviary con-
taining other hens, not because she likes her female companions, but
rather for the opposite reason. Her greatest joy in life is to own a nest
which she knows another hen wants or, failing that, one so near to the
nest of the other hen that she is aware that her proximity will cause
the latter acute annoyance ! This spirit in hen budgerigars is indeed
somewhat akin to that of members of the British public who will
always co-operate together much more loyally and effectively if
inspired by hatred to a common enemy than they can ever be persuaded
to do from the more Christian motive of love of their fellows !
When I first came to Devonshire in the middle of May the actual
display of birds at liberty was a little disappointing. This was partly
due to the fact that this year, like last, the first round of eggs had
hatched rather badly, eight pairs producing only sixteen young birds.
A further cause of trouble was a particularly objectionable Sparrow-
hawk which had been visiting the aviary very regularly and might
have taken one or two of the young birds and driven others away.
Normally a Sparrowhawk has considerable difficulty in capturing
an adult budgerigar, which is too swift and wary, but it will take
young ones not long out of the nest in addition to upsetting the nerves
of the whole aviary. In this particular instance the hawk's visits
had turned practically all the old breeding birds into non-exits as,
discovering that the aviary and its shelter were a safe refuge, they made
up their minds not to leave them, only the venturesome young birds
continuing to fly in and out freely. Although we were never able to
shoot it, the hawk discontinued its visits from the time I arrived and
I set myself to making preparations for discouraging it or ending
its career should it feel tempted to return. One quite useful method of
discouragement is an effective scarecrow properly clothed, constructed,

and managed. The usual coat and hat on a stick left always in the same
place are quite useless and even the shyest birds soon ignore them.
To be of any real value a scarecrow must be decently dressed (!) ;
its raiment, preferably showy, should be changed from time to time,
as also, at fairly frequent intervals, should be its location, so that
birds never come to accept it as an unvarying feature in the landscape.
Most important of all is it that its face should have a pleasingly or
unpleasingly human expression, for it is this particular feature which,
more than any other, attracts the attention of birds and creates
alarm.
With regard to methods of destroying the hawk, the gun is, of
course, useful if the hawk's visits will only coincide with the periods
which someone can devote to waiting for it. The only two effective
hawk traps I know of are the pole-trap which is illegal, cruel, and
likely to catch the wrong bird ; and the box-trap, on the model of
what used to be known as Black's hawk-trap. This consists of a kind of
large box of wire netting on a wooden frame. It has a false bottom
divided from the upper part with wire netting and an open lid or top
connected with a strong spring and a kind of perch inside the trap.
In the bottom of the trap live sparrows are placed, in endeavouring
to reach which by jumping on to an interior perch the hawk dislodges
it and causes the spring to operate, bringing down the roof of the trap
and leaving it a prisoner. The chief objection to a trap of this kind
is that it is rather hard on the " bait ", for Passer domesticus resents
confinement so much more than other finch-like species that even I,
who dislike him intensely, do not care to subject him to it for any length
of time. In order to retain the advantages of the box-type of hawk-
trap while eliminating the objections, I have invented an arrange-
ment which, for its upper portion, has all the normal features, while the
lower one consists of a roomy flight cage, or miniature aviary flight
communicating with a comfortable shelter. In this small aviary
I have put some Roller canaries which are very happy and contented
in what are, for their kind, palatial quarters and which, should the
hawk attempt an assault upon them cannot, of course, receive any
injury.
The second round of young budgerigars which have now been
flying for some weeks have provided an extremely lovely show as
among them are some very attractive colours--opaline blues, lutinos,
lemons, and rainbows. A lady visitor seeing them described it as
"just like fairyland", a rather apt simile, for there is something
close to Nature and yet unique and " unnatural " in its dainty beauty,
in the spectacle at liberty of a small flock of graceful little birds, all
of the same species yet of quite different and brilliant colours.
Budgerigars, especially young birds a few weeks out of the nest, are
particularly delightful in flight as they circle round and round like

contribution but, being less frisky and playful than the young and
much taken up with domestic duties, they fly less frequently and

THE CAUSE AND CURE OF EYE-DISEASE
By P. H. Hastings (Portsmouth, England)
Having recently rejoined the Avicultural Society, I was very
interested in the article by Dr. F. B. Lake on the Parrakeet Eye Disease.
It appears to me by the description of the symptoms and drawings,
identical with the condition found in a great number of freshly imported
birds, especially insectivorous species.
For over thirty years I have been an importer of livestock from the
tropics, specializing more in the insectivorous species than seed-
eaters. During this period I would say that probably several thousands
of birds have arrived with the disease in various stages. The Starling
group appears to have a very large percentage with this complaint and
another species in which it seems prevalent is the Pekin Robin.
In my early days it was my general practice, and I believe of other
importers, painlessly to destroy the badly affected birds as no cure was
known. However, about 1928 the manufacturing chemists with whom I
was dealing for essential food ingredients, forwarded to me a copy of the
book entitled The Survey of Vitamins , published by H.M. Medical
Research Council in which there was an illustration of a rat suffering
from this eye complaint and described as follows :--
The first symptom observed is a swelling of the eyelids which is
followed by an inflamed condition of the conjunctiva. Haemorrhagic
and purulent discharges follow : the cornea becomes affected and
ultimately blindness results. This seemed to me to be identical with
the conditions I had observed in birds, and in this and subsequent
publications, the disease is called Xerohthalmia and is proved beyond
doubt to be the result of malnutrition, particularly and most conclu-
sively in the lack of Vitamin A in the diet.
On the very day I read this paragraph, I received a rather large
consignment of Starlings, and in the Spreo species particularly there were
several very bad cases, and others with a more mild condition. I
decided to put the information to a practical test. I isolated three

birds which in the normal way I would have destroyed at once.
At about 4 p.m. I gave each bird three drops of best cod liver oil
direct into the throat, and by about 8 p.m. there was a marked improve-
ment in that the irritation seemed to have subsided, the birds dis-
continuing to rub their heads on the perch. I gave another three
drops to each bird at about io p.m. that evening. The next morning,
being very anxious to note improvement if any, I got up at 7 a.m., and
went straight to the birdhouse. I was simply astounded at the result,
all swelling had disappeared, the eyes were bright and full and there
was no sign of the complaint other than the bareness around the
eyes, caused by the continual rubbing.
Since then, as stated, I have had innumerable cases and in one
particular consignment of Pekins I had about a hundred suffering
with the complaint in various degrees, the worst I treated with a few
drops into the beak, and the more mild cases were rapidly cured by
normal feeding. In my whole experience since that first example
of the cure, I cannot recall a single failure. In more recent years
I have used Halibut Oil, as it is more potent, and a couple of drops into
the beak will cure or rapidly cause a change for the better, the com-
plete cure following with normal feeding with nutritious food. The
rapid recovery of serious cases after the treatment has never failed to
intrigue me.
In 1932 I wrote about this disease in the Avicultural Magazine
and as a result of my article I was called in to the Hundridge
Game Farm, at Hambledon, to treat seven pheasants which had the
complaint. I gave a pen-filler to each bird direct into the beak. I
was phoned the next day and informed that all birds were normal
again and was thanked profusely.
I have also found this disease in mammals and quite recently I was
asked to call at a neighbours to treat a young greyhound of fourteen
weeks. It was explained to me that the dog had, it seemed, knocked
its head and there was a great swelling ; it had been taken to a vet
and some lotion was given for bathing the swelling. I went along
and directly I saw the condition I said, malnutrition. They looked
askance, being kindly folk, and said they were feeding as instructed
by the breeder. The left eye was completely closed, the head on that
side being twice as large as it should be, the right eye was not so badly
affected, and the skin around the left eye bare of fur by continual
rubbing. I gave the dog three Halibut Oil capsules at 8 p.m., and
left two more for the owner to give before retiring. As in the case of
the birds, recovery was phenomenal, the next morning there being no
sign of any disease, swelling wholly disappeared and the puppy lively
and skipping about in play. Other than the general thinness of the
puppy and the bareness around the eye, no one would have ever
believed it was in such a state the previous evening.

It does not appear that Dr. Lake has treated this condition in
parrakeets as a vitamin deficiency disease. Should he have the oppor-
tunity of experimenting further, perhaps he will consider the treatment
I have described. If any of our members have birds with such con-
ditions, I would be pleased to endeavour to cure them, but I feel sure
that if the treatment given above is carried out by any fancier, a cure
will be effected and the chance of prolonged and painful suffering
prevented.
I trust the information given will be instrumental in saving many
birds the painful suffering caused by this affliction.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
It was by merest chance that I first acquired this most delightful
species. I was visiting a bird-dealer's in order to purchase some
Glossy Starlings on behalf of a friend and whilst there could not
refrain from looking round at his wares. Three Lanceolated Jays
(Garrulus lanceolatus) at once attracted my attention. Two were
sharing a cage and looking rather dejected, the third, caged alone, was
in still worse plight, having one foot swollen to the size of a small
crab-apple. On inquiry I was told that the latter would be sold to
street traders who, so I gathered, make a weekly round of animal
dealers and buy up cheap all the birds, puppies, etc., that are likely
to die, for sale in the street markets on Sunday. As the dealer honestly
admitted that he would only get a pound for the sick bird I paid over
this sum and took it away, thinking that at least it would now be able
to die unharassed.
Arrived home the crippled Jay ate mealworms eagerly and its death
appeared less certain. I at once became the prey of conflicting impulses.
On the one hand I had little cash and little spare aviary space (although
shortly the loss of two young Magpies which joined up with a wild
family and went off with them partly solved the latter problem),
and so it would be folly to get more birds. On the other hand, would
it not be cruel to keep the one Jay in solitude ? and how much could
I expect to learn of its behaviour from a solitary bird ? Personal
inclination thus rallied both science and sentiment to its aid, as it so
often does, and the result was a foregone conclusion. The dealer
agreed to sell the other two Jays for six pounds, in view of their poor
condition, and even threw in a very excellent wicker travelling cage
in which he dispatched them to me.

I was pleased to find that although somewhat thin, and in very
scruffy plumage the two sound Jays did not appear to be sick in
any way. I gave them plenty of mealworms, dug up a few cockchafer
grubs for them on most days, added vitamin supplements to their soft-
food (wholemeal sop), and gave them rather more meat than I would
otherwise give a Jay. On this regime they soon showed vast improve-
ment, although it was not until after the moult that they came into
their full beauty of perfect plumage. It was early May when I got
these birds. The crippled specimen became dominant over the other
two and soon showed much improvement and its swollen foot went
back to normal size, although incapable of use except as a " peg-leg ".
Actually, however, this would appear to have been just a dormant
stage of the trouble afflicting it, as it died only fifteen months later.
In August, when the Jays were in moult, I acquired two more.
These were picked out from six that a dealer had in a small outdoor
aviary. Until that time I had had only a vague idea of the sex of my
three birds but when the two newcomers were put in the aviary they
at once took precedence over the original occupants, thus leading
me to suspect, as later proved correct, that they were two cocks and
the others all hens. They were colour-ringed and afterwards became
known thereby : Green male, Yellow male, Red female, White female,
and the Crippled hen. In December I acquired a sixth bird, which
was given a blue ring and also turned out to be a hen.
Since nothing very exciting happened in the winter months I may
here digress to give a brief description of this splendid bird for the
benefit of those who do not know it. It is a smaller and more slightly
built bird than our common Jay (Garrulus glandarius ) with a pro-
portionately longer tail and crest. It is a little larger than a Blue
Jay (Cyanocitta cristata) and with rather similar pattern on wings
and tail. The general body colour is a soft pinkish grey. The head and
crest are black, the lanceolate throat feathers are white with black
bases, those of the lower throat being black with white shaft-streaks,
and those of the upper breast steel grey with white shaft-streaks.
The wings and tail (when at rest) show mainly a soft, delicate blue,
barred with black, the tail feathers and secondaries have black sub-
terminal bands and broad white tips, and there is a white patch on the
wing coverts. The bill is an odd greenish grey and the eyes dark
brown. In its gait and skilful flight among branches this bird possibly
excels our Common Jay in agility. When in good condition its
plumage has a wonderful bloom comparable to that on a ripe plum
or a really fit Java Sparrow (Padda orizivora). It may indeed be said
of it, as Goldsmith said of the Swan, that " The eye wanders over it
with insatiable pleasure and every part takes on a new grace with each
new movement ".
In its call-notes this species clearly shows its close relationship

to the Common Jay, the majority of its utterances being similar in
sound and meaning. It is also an excellent and habitual mimic,
and its soft warbling sub-song is composed largely of copied notes,
as is the case with our bird. I have dealt elsewhere (Goodwin, 1952)
more fully with a comparison of the voice and display of the two species.
By March the two male Jays, Green and Yellow, were giving their
soft warbling sub-songs very frequently, and beginning also to indulge
in somewhat louder mimicry. They uttered all sorts of bubbling,
whistling, and mewing notes, some of them possibly imitations of various
wild birds in their native Himalayas, although some, such as the calls
of the Golden Pheasant, human whistling, and the whining bark of the
next-door spaniel, had clearly been learnt since their capture. The
females gave some whispering sub-song, but no loud and definite
mimicry was established as coming from them. On 2nd March
Green escaped, dashed off between the house and an outbuilding,
and vanished somewhere in the front garden. I spent a fruitless and
despairing few minutes vainly looking for him in near-by trees, but on
returning to the aviary I found he had preceded me and was flying
round trying to get back in. Needless to say I co-operated with his
endeavours and he was soon safely under lock and key again.
Courtship-feeding was first seen on 23rd March, when Yellow fed
the Crippled hen and Green fed White. From then on it was frequent
and usually initiated by the male. He would take some food, prepare
it for swallowing, then, holding it in his throat, would commence to
give the food-offering note--a long-drawn, husky version of the usual
mewing appeal-call--and approach the female. She would usually
respond before taking the food, by displaying with head held up and
making little sideways movements, uttering soft " chip-chip-chip "
notes. This display, which is also often given by the male before or
after courtship-feeding, is essentially of a placatory or appeasing nature.
It can be considered as, in a sense, the opposite of the male's typical
display, in which he erects his crest and most of the body-feathers and
presents himself laterally, reaching forward on his perch and uttering
a " display-phrase " which may consist of copied sounds. This display
is used both towards the mate and towards rivals, and in the latter
context is threatening in character. In the Common Jay both sexes
use this display, but in the Lanceolated Jay I have only rarely seen it--
at low intensity--given by a female.
From the end of March on the two male birds displayed extremely
frequently, chiefly to each other, perching a foot apart and each
making himself look as imposing as possible in an unsuccessful attempt
to overawe his rival. It was noticeable that although Green still
gave way to the dominant male Yellow at bath or food dish, yet
when they were both in displaying mood he refused to be intimidated by
him. When displaying the males usually uttered a soft, piping,

sibilant " Tsee-tsee-tsee-up ! 55 sometimes a loud, husky mewing note
(probably homologous with the hissing sounds that male Common
Jays usually incorporate in their display-phrases), and occasionally
the " Kraah " note, or copied sounds. On one occasion when Yellow
was in a state of intense angry excitement he displayed at Green
screeching out a loud imitation of the " crow 55 of a cock Golden
Pheasant. Green, as if not to be outdone, displayed back at him,
barking loudly (imitation of a dog) as he did so.
On 17th April I separated the two pairs (the odd hens had been
removed previously) and placed Green and White in an open aviary
about 40 feet by 20, leaving Yellow and the Crippled hen in a smaller
aviary about 28 by 9, with a shelter shed about 5 by 5 attached.
Once the birds were separated the males displayed much less often
and less intensely.
Within a couple of days I noticed that Green and his mate were
taking much interest in the upper branches of a small apple tree which
had been cut off and placed in a slanting position in one corner of
the aviary. At 7 p.m. I fixed some wire netting in a fork about 7 feet
high in such a way that a bowl-shaped support was formed. The male
soon came back to the tree. Hopping about the branches he came on
the artificial nest-site. He at once entered it, turning round and
giving the soft chirruping notes. The hen flew to him, and perched
on the edge, they chirruped and gave the " chin-up " display together.
Green picked up and dropped nesting material shortly after, but he
did not carry any to the nest-site till the following day. Thereafter
he did some building each day. He appeared to have great difficulty
in selecting suitable material. In a wild state this species is said to line
its nest with the long black rhizoids of a fungus (Whistler, 1928) and
although my birds finally achieved a beautiful nest from twigs, heather
stems, rootlets, and coconut fibre the male at any rate would discard
numberless pieces of material before finding one that suited him. For
a long time little tangible result seemed to accrue from his efforts,
but on the 30th April much more solid work was evidently done on
the nest and it looked near completion. I suspect that the female did
some building, as on the morning of 3rd May I found her on the nest
at 7.40 a.m. She soon flew off, collected some fibres from the ground,
flew to the nest-site, but seeing me looking flew off again. Otherwise
she was never seen either with building material or at the nest during
its construction. She gave the impression of being utterly disinterested
in the male's building efforts, but if I went near the nest and looked
at it she would " give the game away " by flying up to perch a foot or
so away and screaming angrily at me. It was noticeable that when not
building the male also kept away from the nest, although previous to its
commencement both birds had been constantly in the tree that held it.
From 3rd May the hen began to beg like a young bird, uttering the

juvenile version of the appeal call and (sometimes) fluttering her
wings. She begged constantly, giving her pleading " childish "
cry every twenty seconds or so, even continuing to do so when she was
actually eating. Her mate was not thereby moved to feed her any more
frequently than he had been doing for the past three weeks.
She went on the nest at about 6.15 a.m. on 5th May, and was
still sitting when I left home at 7.45, but when I got back in the evening
she was off the nest, which was empty. Next morning she again went
on the nest. No eggs had been laid at 7.45 that morning when, unable
to bear the suspense, I put her off the nest and felt in it. Presumably
she laid later that morning, however, as she was sitting when I got
home that evening and at 7 p.m. on 7th May there were two eggs in
nest. Two more followed at daily intervals. The eggs were of no par-
ticularly beauty, being merely small editions of the eggs of the Common
Jay in appearance.
For some days I was torn between a rational assumption that " the
Powers that be 55 would never vouchsafe to me the luck to be the first
person to breed this species, and an irrational optimism that I should
in fact succeed in so doing. As day followed day and all seemed well,
wild hopes began to get the upper hand of cold reason as, luckily
for human peace of mind, they commonly do. The female sat on the
nest continuously from the time the first egg was laid. She came off
several times daily for periods of up to ten minutes--but usually
much less--to exercise, bathe, and preen herself. The male fed her
both on and off the nest, she received the food with juvenile notes and
wing-flutterings. Often she would leave the nest immediately after
having taken food from the male and whilst he was still at the nest.
When this happened he never stayed to guard, much less to cover the
eggs, but at once flew off after his mate.
On the fourteenth morning from the laying of the last egg I felt
it must be a case of " any moment now ". I was well prepared for the
hoped-for happy events. I had a large stock of mealworms that had
been fed, if not on the fat of the land at least in part on the fat of
the sea (food treated with C.L.O.), and had also bought a supply of
Kentish Glory caterpillars, the entomological dealers having had no
cheaper and more mundane species for sale at that time. I may
say I am well aware of the danger of presuming on the kindness of
Fate, but when young birds are on the way one cannot abide by the
wise adage " not to fill one's jar with water till one has caught a fish
On that morning I gave Green some insects and watched carefully when
he fed White with them. She accepted them as usual, and did not look
beneath her before swallowing them, so I gathered that even though the
eggs might be chipped it was not likely that any were yet hatched.
When I returned that evening the first thing I noticed was White
off the nest. My heart sank. I guessed instantly what had happened.

Then I tried to believe that she was only off for exercise, she would
soon go back. Needless to say she did nothing of the kind, and the
nest, on inspection, proved to be empty, and clean as the proverbial
whistle.
Presumably the birds, or more probably only the female, had eaten
the hatching eggs, or new-hatched young. This behaviour is known
to happen not rarely with insect-eating birds in captivity and I have
strong grounds for suspecting that it may occasionally occur in the wild.
It is due not I think to the bird's reproductive urge suddenly dying
away (which would result in the nestlings being treated as any other
small creature), but rather to a hypertrophy or perversion of the
strong instinct which such birds show to keep the nest clean by eating
all extraneous objects (eggshells, faeces, fallen leaves, etc.), that appear
in it. Probably this only happens when some disturbing influence has
upset the sitting bird. In the case of these Jays there was a loud and
noisy party in the adjoining garden on the fateful day and this may have
disturbed them.
The behaviour of the pair that evening showed that they were in
some mental stress. Both, but especially the male, kept returning to
the nest and looking into it as if they could not convince themselves
that it was really empty. When I went near the nest the female came
dashing up and scolded at me just as she had before. Quite clearly she
did not in any way correlate her eating of the eggs with their mysterious
disappearance ! She begged constantly to her mate, but Green,
instead of feeding her, snapped at her angrily and sometimes even
attacked her. This was not, of course, because he thought that she was
responsible for the loss of the eggs (as no doubt she was) but simply
that his bereavement had put him in an aggressive mood, and it needed
only slight stimulus for him to vent his feelings on his mate in default
of any other victim. Homologous behaviour in other bipeds is, of
course, not uncommon.
Next morning the pair had got over their loss and the male was once
more feeding his mate solicitously. He was still in breeding condition
and within a few days was building a second nest in a basket fixed in a
tree at the opposite end of the aviary. White, to my dismay, showed
no interest whatever in the new nest. She ceased to beg in juvenile
manner and showed less enthusiasm for courtship-feeding. A day or
two later, as she was preening, a tail feather came away in her bill.
She held it for a second or two with that puzzled " Good God ! am
I falling to pieces ? " expression which Jays often show when this
happens, and I knew that all chance of her breeding again that year
was gone.
Whilst all this had been going on Yellow and his mate the Crippled
hen had, up to a point, shown similar behaviour. This female never
showed the slightest signs of wishing to nest but she had commenced

<bodyText confidence="0.999562044444445" page_id="56291902"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
to beg in juvenile manner at the same time as White had done. Although
this begging coincided with the breeding season I think it may not
have been caused by the reproductive drive. This bird gradually
wasted away until she died in August and it seems possible that her
illness induced in her a similar psychological mood of " dependence "
to that normally aroused in an incubating female. Infantile behaviour
(or perhaps one should rather say behaviour that is normally shown
most strongly in infancy) by adult animals that are in a weak state
through hunger or sickness is not infrequent, one need look no further
than man and the domestic Pigeon to see examples of it. The male
Yellow frequently carried nesting material about the aviary and
deposited some of it in an artificial site inside the shelter, where
perhaps he would have nested had his mate shown a reciprocal interest.
I must confess that I made very few observations on the two females
Blue and Red during this time, so I am not sure if they showed any
breeding behaviour. They certainly did not pair together.
On 10th June, in the early evening, I put the other four birds into
the large aviary with Green and White. These two showed some
aggression towards the newcomers, displaying at them and attacking
them, but they were not systematic or persistent about it and soon
ceased to do so. Next morning Yellow displayed near Green's first
nest-site, and the female Blue, who was near, at once responded
with the chin-up display. Green, observing this, flew up, drove off
Yellow, and went into display himself. Blue, acting on the proverb
about the brave and the fair, then displayed submissively to him. He
hopped into the nest site and pecked (? low-intensity building move-
ment) at a twig. Blue at once showed great excitement, she hopped
to the edge of the site, gave most intense versions of the chin-up
display and quivered her tail violently. Green did not respond, how-
ever, but remained " true " to his old mate. Within a few weeks
all were in moult and all hopes of breeding from them that year
were over. They are now (12th February, 1953) showing signs of
awakening sexual activity once more, and I live in hope, though
hardly in expectation, that I shall have better luck with them in 1953.
So far as one can judge from what has been written about this bird
its habits in freedom (Ali, 1949 ; Whistler, 1928) would appear to be
very similar to those of the Common Jay. Its movements are very
similar and it has the same manner of commonly hopping about with
the tail slightly raised and the tips of both wings lying on the same side
of the tail, which gives it a very jaunty appearance. It hides surplus
food--especially nuts and acorns--in the same way, pushing it into
the ground and then carefully covering it up or else sticking it into
some crevice or hole above the ground. It remembers where it has
hidden its booty and in a wild state probably relies largely on previously
hidden acorns for its winter food.

My Lanceolated Jays are fond of sun-bathing which they do--
usually on the ground--in the typical passerine manner. The bird
leans over to one side with feathers fluffed out, crest erect, and com-
monly with wing and tail on side nearest the sun somewhat spread.
Bathing, preening, and scratching are also performed in the typical
passerine manner. At night my birds roost well hidden in the foliage
of Cupressus trees, or in conifer branches fixed in the aviary. They go
to roost early (unless some alarm or excitement at the normal roosting
time inhibits them from so doing) whilst it is still perfectly light and
once on their roosting perches do not come off again that evening
unless greatly disturbed. Even giving mealworms to a companion
still up will seldom induce a roosting bird to come out, although
if in such a case it is deliberately driven out it will at once commence to
feed readily. Doubtless this behaviour has protective value in the wild
state by rendering the roosting bird less liable to be discovered by owls
or other crepuscular or nocturnal enemies.
In captivity I have found this bird as hardy and easy to cater for
as the Common Jay. Many bird-keepers, scientists and laymen alike,
seem to find difficulty in keeping Jays in good condition. Primarily
I think this is because they often try to feed them on horrible mixtures
of ground-up dog biscuit, eked out with lumps of horsemeat, and with
the addition of chopped-up root vegetables more suitable for cows
than for corvids. Such a diet may suit Crows and Ravens (at any rate
in zoos where they obtain all sorts of extras from the public) fairly well,
but I have never known a Jay to thrive on such a regime. For these
birds a variety of foods is necessary (though no doubt if their exact
food requirements were fully known a suitable artificial food could be
concocted). Acorns, which are appreciated just as much when
sprouting as when fresh, form an excellent staple as long as they can be
obtained, and with a little trouble the Jay-keeper should be able to lay
in a stock in autumn to last him till February or March. At other times
wholemeal sop, dry wholemeal bread, chestnuts, peanuts, etc., can
make up the bulk of the food (and should be used to vary it even
when acorns are plentiful). This should be varied with any insects
obtainable, small pieces of meat (horse or otherwise, cooked or raw),
cooked (scrambled) egg, and cheese. These extras are best fed by hand
and only as much as the birds will swallow on the spot, as owing to the
amount of dirt that will adhere to them it is not desirable that they
should be hidden for future consumption which they otherwise will
be. For the oft maligned mealworm I have nothing but praise.
Doubtless if they are inadequately fed they do not contain sufficient
vitamins, but I cannot help thinking that much of the objection to
them arises from that puritan streak that makes some people think
that anything that a creature--be it man or bird--obviously delights
in must be bad for it. I try to give all my Jays a feed of mealworms

at least once or twice a week--more often when they are moulting--
and if I were wealthier I would certainly give them a larger supply of
these insects. Among the many wild insects that Jays relish may be
mentioned cockchafers which, during the few May-days that they are
on the wing, may be caught in numbers clinging about the street
lamps after dark. Lay observers of the aviculturist capturing them
are, however, apt to think that he is either mad, drunk, or attempting
to sabotage the lighting system. Jays are fond of fruit, oranges and
apples are best liked and cheapest, they do not like soft fruits enough
to warrant the price, although if one grows one's own they can be
given. Elderberries are the only wild fruit they seem keen on. Needless
to say one must use one's intelligence in feeding, add vitamin supple-
ments to the soft food if considered necessary and allow plenty of
animal food to growing young birds (these cannot at first digest nuts or
acorns) and recently purchased adults that are thin and run down.
Leafmould (the top surface layer from woodland) makes an excellent
floor covering for Jays and gives them ample scope for food burying.
In large aviaries natural turf looks nice, but is apt to grow so long that
the Jays will seldom descend into it. I sprinkle plenty of powdered lime
about before putting down fresh leafmould, and put lime frequently
under roosting perches and elsewhere where the ground is likely to be
much fouled.
Plenty of fresh water for bathing and drinking must always be
available. Anting is another instinctive impulse which should be
catered for, though few aviculturists give their birds the opportunity
to indulge it. A sack of wood-ants (just shovel nest, ants, and all into
a sack) tipped out on the floor of the aviary every three weeks or so in
summer will provide a most interesting spectacle for their owner as
well as gratifying the birds. It is of interest that the Lanceolated Jay
acts in the usual manner, picking up the ants in its bill and bringing
forward one wing at a time, whereas the Common Jay brings forward
both wings at a time with a peculiar shuddering movement, spreads
them widely with the primaries brushing the ground and does not pick
up ants in its bill, although it makes head movements that look at a
distance as if it is doing so.
Note .--The sketches illustrating this article are only intended to
give a general idea of some characteristic postures. No attempt has
been made at accuracy of fine detail. The discerning will, for instance,
note a regrettable discrepancy in the number of tail bars in the
different drawings, and if they want to know how many the bird in
fact possesses I fear they must visit their nearest museum and look
at a stuffed one !

By Stanton Phillips (Long Beach, California, U.S.A.)
A correct interpretation of the actions of any waterfowl as little
known as the Peruvian Torrent Duck is difficult. This is particularly
true when the bird involved demonstrates an apparently large variety
of behaviour patterns. With this in mind I submit the following
observation :--
It was originally my intention in going to Peru to capture and keep
in captivity the Peruvian Torrent Duck. In pursuit of this end a group
was formed in Lima consisting of Dr. Ortiz de la Puente, Director of
the birds and mammals section of the Javier Prado Museum of Natural
History ; Mr. Luis Riva, engineer and amateur ornithologist ;
and myself.
Reaching Yacca, a hacienda at 2,500 metres on the Rio Canete,
we established camp. The river was swollen as are most Andean
streams during the month of January and, since this made the use of
our nets impracticable, we contented ourselves with whatever observa-
tions were possible. Mr. Riva and I were walking on a small hill
downstream when, at a distance of approximately 500 feet before us,
we saw a mature drake poised motionless on a jutting midstream
rock. We seated ourselves, focused binoculars, and waited. With
great dignity it bowed deeply, at the same time pushing the tip
of its tail upward to a height exceeding that of its vertically extended
neck and head. The entire action appeared to be pendulum-like
with the feet serving as inverted fulcrums. After each such four
or five second performance, it would resume its usual stance which
was marked only by an occasional turn of the head. It would then
advance 6 to 12 inches and perform again. With about fifteen of these
completed it had reached the end of the rock and abruptly flew cross-
stream into the less torrential side waters. Here it disappeared.
Our temptation to believe that we were the objects of the display
was somewhat dispelled when, after arriving within 50 feet of the rock,
we discovered a mature female standing on a portion of the rock
where our original point of observation made such discovery impossible.
We observed her for about ten minutes and, although she could see
our every movement, she gave no sign of fear. She finally and leisurely
slipped into the water and floated downstream.
The stimulating agent for the drake's conduct could be anything,
of course, including the aforementioned female, ourselves, a twig
in the throat, or maybe another female. It was probably the
latter.

By G. de Goederen (Amsterdam, Holland)
In the January-February number of the Avicultural Magazine
I was already able to lift the edge of the curtain concerning the
Louise Hall, the new birdhouse of Wassenaar Zoo. When this article
appears the Louise Hall will be open and I would like to take my
readers for a walk through this new building.
When entering the birdhouse we are at once confronted with the
large centre aviaries which are approximately 30 feet long and wide
and about 14 feet high. All of them are planted with various types
of vegetation which is gradually changing. The first aviary contains a
marvellous pair of Lesser Birds of Paradise which in this large enclosure
can freely use their power of flight. It is a very beautiful sight indeed
to see these birds, but imagine the sight of half a dozen fully feathered
Quetzals flying in all their beauty in the tree-tops of the next aviary !
Dierenpark " Wassenaar 55 was one of the first zoos that ever had
Quetzals in its collection, but one must see these beautiful birds here
in quite natural surroundings fully to grasp their beauty.
The next centre aviary contains quite a number of species of
Touracos, among which there are a Senegal Violet Plantain-eater
(Musophaga violacea ), some White-breasted Touracos ( Corythaixoides
leucogaster) (labelled Touraco Gymnoschizorhis per sonata), and Guinea
Touracos (Turacus per so). Victoria Crowned Pigeons, together with
Indian Blue Rollers and Cotton Teal inhabit the next enclosure.
Knot-willows are the favourite resting-place of the Rollers, in
their beautiful flight range above the Pigeons and Teal, which are
chiefly confined to the lower part. A small pond extends into a creek
in the next aviary, where the vegetation gives the impression of a
swamp and where various species of Plover-like birds and Rallidae are
to be seen with various Fruit Pigeons and other colourful birds in the
tree-tops. Trumpeters, Red-billed Curassows, Piping Grows, and
various smaller Hornbills are found in the aviaries. Stretching along
both sides of the birdhouse are forty-eight smaller aviaries, generally
about 5 feet wide and 1 o feet long, in which we find a great number of
very rare species. There are both the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock and
the normal Cock-of-the-Rock, both in splendid condition, Red (. Para-
disea rubra), Wilson's ( Schlegelia wilsonii), King, and Magnificent Birds
of Paradise, European Bee-eaters, various Toucans and Toucanets,
Indian Sunbirds, Humming Birds, numerous Tanagers, and an
impressive collection of Lories and Lorikeets as well as Australian
parrakeets.
It would be too much to give separately the names of all these
species, but I cannot remember ever having seen a more complete

collection. Needless to say that these smaller aviaries are planted
with various bushes and flowers (except, of course, those that contain
parrot-like birds), and in doing so the utmost care was taken to
consider the biological needs of the birds.
In addition to these larger enclosures approximately forty smaller
cages are reserved for single birds, most of them parrots. Among them
Golden Conures, Hawk-headed Parrots, Crimson-breasted Gonures
(Pyrrhura rhodogaster ), and Levaillant's Barbets.
At the farthest side of the birdhouse the vegetation of the central
aviaries is gradually replaced by towering rocks containing some large
aquaria for cold water fish and at the same time concealing a bird
kitchen and food store. There is also a modern hospital room with
laboratory.
The former birdhouse is now being rebuilt and will chiefly contain
the larger species of parrots, such as the rare Kea (,Nestor
notabilis), Funereal, Gang-gang, Leadbeater's Cockatoos, Macaws, etc.

By Major H. R. Hendy (Mbabana, Swaziland, S. Africa)
I have travelled in most parts of the world, but in my opinion
Swaziland surpasses them all in climate and scenic beauty. Frost is
very rare indeed, and though in the summer it inclines to be warm,
the evenings are always cool. The climate is most suitable for the
rearing of birds, especially Pheasants. Of these I have a large collec-
tion, amounting at the present time to twenty species. These include
Monals, Brown and Blue Eared Manchurians, Versicolors, Germain's
Peacocks, Blacknecks, Mongolians, Chinese, Melanistic Mutants,
Whites, Goldens, Silvers, Lady Amherst's, Elliot's, Cheers, Nepal
Kaleegs, Swinhoes, Siamese Firebacks, and Reeves's. I should very
much like to have Tragopans and other species of Firebacks.
To look after my Pheasants and other birds which I shall mention
later, I have five native boys under an Induna or headboy, and it is
a constant daily task to supervise them and keep things clean and
sanitary. I must, however, go at least once a month to Johannesburg
which is 235 miles away where is my business and where I must stay
for periods ranging from a few days to two weeks. On account of
these necessary absences I have at times lost valuable stock. Without
my business, however, I could not afford what in South Africa is an
expensive hobby. It has the added advantage that it prevents me
growing old too quickly. I do not know what I would do without it,
and one of my greatest joys is to receive letters from different parts
of the world where I have written to for rare birds, from Singapore,

for instance, whence may come the fabulous Argus Pheasant. Yet
when I return from Johannesburg I invariably find I have lost birds
due to the inability of the native boys ever to discern signs of sickness
or that a bird is off its feed.
Once a week every pen and house, and I have over a hundred, is
sprayed with D.D.T., and every day without exception every pen
is raked and cleaned of all manure and stale food. During the breeding
season I employ a small boy or Unfaam to do nothing else but walk
round all the pens and collect the eggs, for egg-eating can become
a serious habit, and this is the only way I know to prevent it. Every
egg is marked with the number of the pen and the date, and is then
stamped with the name of the species of Pheasant. To hatch these
eggs I have built two large circular pens, each containing twelve
smaller pens, each consisting of a small house and run. I put the
broodies in these smaller pens for a couple of nights to make sure
they want to sit, and I then place the Pheasant eggs under them.
I use as broodies White Silkies, Light Sussex, and good old Kaffir
hens, which are always going broody, and which are of all colours,
shapes, and sizes, having been bred by the natives for many genera-
tions. I make sure they are free of any disease.
A complete record is kept of all the eggs under each hen, and the
day they are due to hatch out. The moment the chicks are hatched,
they are whisked away to brooders, all of which have an enclosed
outdoor run. These brooders are paraffin-heated, as the electric
supply here is uncertain, especially during the severe lightning storms
which we have. At the height of the breeding season I have as many
as forty or fifty hens sitting at one time. The overflow from the
round pens is accommodated in nests specially built in a large room.
Feeding presents a problem. We have no balanced ration especially
made by manufacturers for Pheasants. We can obtain a balanced
ration for poultry, but it does not contain ingredients essential for
Pheasants. Fortunately, however, my property is surrounded by
hundreds of ant heaps, so I can give my newly-born chicks plenty
of ants and their eggs. They just eat these by the thousand, and
thrive wonderfully, and this is all they eat for the first few days. They
always have biscuit meal mixed with raw liver, calcium, Vetemul
(Vitamin A and D), egg custard, and the yolk of hard boiled egg.
In addition they get finely-chopped lettuce. After four weeks I give
them the balanced poultry chick mash to which I add buck wheat,
Kaffir corn, wheat, millet, and barley. The ants, however, seem to
remain their favourite food until they are weaned and placed in the
larger outdoor pens.
I pinion most birds at about six weeks old.
This last season I tried the experiment of selling some Pheasant eggs
to encourage other breeders in South Africa. Unfortunately it was

not an outstanding success due to the rough handling of the packages
by the postal authorities. The eggs arrived intact, but the airsacs
seem to have been damaged and consequently few eggs hatched.
The question might be asked whether in view of the ideal weather
conditions, birds could not be bred on a large scale for shooting, but
this has been tried on several occasions only to end in dismal failure.
This was due for the most part to the many vermin we have in South
Africa. Meercats, leopards and hawks kill off the young stock before
they have a chance to become acclimatized. There is also the difficulty
of obtaining sufficient cover for the birds when they are released.
The experiment has been tried in the Gape, Natal, and elsewhere
without success.
Besides the Pheasants I have a varied collection of other larger
birds. I have Kenya Crested Cranes, Stanley Cranes, Sarus Cranes,
Demoiselle and Lilford Cranes, White, Black, and Black-necked
Swans, Flamingoes, Curassows, and Toucans from Brazil. I have all
types of Guinea-fowl, including the beautiful Vulturine, which is
breeding well. Then there is the Secretary Bird which is fed every
morning with a large juicy rat. The Australian Brush Turkey and
the Chukar Partridge are also included in my collection, but I have
not been successful with the latter, and need some new blood.
I also have African Spurwing, Egyptian, Barnicle, Siberian, Red-
Breasted, Australian Cereopsis and White-fronted Geese, and I have
among ducks the European Sheld, the South African Sheld, the rare
South African Black Duck, Mallards, and, of course, the lovely
Carolinas and Mandarins. I have, too, Peacocks and a recently
imported pair of White Peacocks which have already bred. I have
thus a varied assortment, and undoubtedly the largest and most
comprehensive collection in South Africa. I cannot say I am
successful in breeding them all.
All the birds, with the exception of those in the Pheasant breeding
pens, are kept in large paddocks which I have landscaped with trees,
green grass, and where necessary small ponds or dams with running
water. The many paddocks are so arranged as to harmonize with the
gardens around my house. There are not a lot of unsightly fences,
except where absolutely necessary and then these are covered with
the prolific Grenadilla Vine. Our rainfall is 56 inches, so gardens are
possible the year round.
At times, however, when I want to sit quietly and think over my
past misdeeds, I can sit in a large greenhouse which I recently
imported from England and look at my begonias and gloxinias, and
other beautiful hothouse flowers, and through the doorway I can see
the Cranes dancing their afternoon dances, and when the Sarus
Cranes start the same antics, one cannot but be amused at the ungainly
way in which they imitate the graceful Stanley.

THE MARQUESS HACHISUKA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996816285714286" page_id="56291914"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
Masauji, eighteenth Marquess Hachisuka, Ph.D., Sc.D., died
suddenly of a heart ailment on 14th May, 1953, at his home at Atami,
Japan, at the age of 50. He appeared to be in such good health that
his untimely demise was quite unexpected.
Marquess Hachisuka will be greatly missed all over the world. He
was born and first educated in Japan until, at the age of 19, he came to
Europe to complete his training in the Western way. The writer can
remember when he first met him, in Paris in 1922. Prince N. Taka-
Tsukasa, then staying in France, was to dine at our house on a certain
day, when he asked if he could bring a young relative of his just
arrived from Japan. He then introduced Masauji Hachisuka. Under
the guidance of Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Ambassador in London
and a friend of his father, Vice-President of the Japanese House of
Peers, he pursued zoological studies at Cambridge University during
the next five years, finally graduating before he returned to Japan,
through America in 1927, in company with the writer. The colourful
welcome given to him by the aristocracy and the officials of Japan,
headed by his father and his uncle, Prince Tokugawa, the last Shogun,
still remains vivid in my memory. We later travelled together to Korea
and China ; he conducted an expedition to the Philippines in 1928-9
but he soon returned to Europe, where he stayed until 1934. He had
previously travelled a good deal in Europe and North Africa, and went
to the Belgian Congo with the late Jean-Marie Derscheid ; he also paid
a lengthy visit to the King and Queen of Bulgaria.
During all these years Hachisuka was one of our inner circle of
European bird-friends. He attended meetings and conventions
regularly in England, France, and elsewhere. Whilst travelling back
to Japan through the United States he fell seriously ill at Los Angeles
and remained there for four years, during which he completely
recovered. The writer spent several months with him in 1936-7 at
Pasadena and has never seen him again since. In the course of these
years spent in California, he had made many close friends there.
Hachisuka returned to Japan in 1938, on his father's death, and he
soon married Chiye Nagamini, of Los Angeles. They had a daughter,
now being educated in California.
The war period was difficult for him because of his Western ways
and friendships. After peace was restored, his wealth greatly diminished,
he lived quietly at Atami, where he had built a Moorish-styled house
to his own liking, again surrounded himself with birds, resumed his
studies, and carried on an assiduous correspondence with his old
friends in America and in Europe. His unexpectedly early death is
a great shock to them.

Hachisuka was a true lover of birds, live birds in freedom and
captivity, as well as museum specimens. As an aviculturist he kept
and raised many species in Japan, particularly pheasants. He collected
bird skins extensively in the Philippines and elsewhere, and also
acquired private collections. Most of his early work on birds was done
in the museum at Tring and in London.
His publications were very numerous. Besides many articles and
notes in the Avicultural Magazine, LOiseau, the Ibis, the B.O.C. Bulletin,
Tori, and other periodicals, he had written books on the birds of Egypt,
Iceland, the Philippines, Hainan, Formosa, and a treatise on bird
variation. His splendid book on The Dodo and Kindred Birds has just
come out, but he never saw it. He had been working lately on a book
of birds of China.
Although Marquess Hachisuka had been unwillingly separated from
his Western friends during the last fifteen years his memory has
remained vivid in their minds, as well as their affection for him.

Mme. E. Lecallier has recently died in Brittany in her 74th year.
Many of our members will remember her and her huge collection
of birds which she kept at Chateau de la Villette and in other gardens
around Elbeuf, in Normandy, between 1920 and 1940. Besides a
number of park animals (Blackbucks, Muntjacs, Wallabies, etc.) and
birds (Cranes, Rheas, Emus, waterfowl and screamers, game-birds),
she possessed hundreds of rare parrakeets, doves, and small birds of all
sorts in row upon row of roomy and practical aviaries, and in several
large bird rooms. She was exceedingly successful in breeding many
rare species, a number for the first time in captivity, as well as more
ordinary ones. Accounts of her achievements are found in our
Magazine and in L'Oiseau. The remnants of her collection were wiped
out by the 1940 invasion and she had since lived with one or the other
of her numerous children in Normandy and in Brittany. She had
missed her birds greatly.
The writer had long been a close friend and neighbour of hers and
we passed many happy hours discussing birds and visiting each other's
aviaries.
With Mme. Lecallier one of the great bird collectors of the between-
war era has disappeared and her friends feel her loss deeply.

Upland Goose have been bred, together with a number of the more
common pheasants.
The Lesser Black-backed and the Herring Gulls are considered
by some ornithologists to be colour phases of the same bird, so two
chicks of this ## cross " bred here in the Southern Aviary are being
ringed and it will be interesting to see their adult coloration.
The mother of last year's King Penguin chick has laid again and the
Snowy Owls have eight eggs. The female Alpine Chough laid one
egg and then died as a result of an egg broken in the oviduct ; the
eggs of the Common or Cornish Choughs were again infertile, as were
those of the Rheas.
A Gang-gang Cockatoo has died, from senility, after being in the
collection for twenty-six years ; a Bengal Red-vented Bulbul after
fifteen years ; and a Purple-headed Glossy Starling after twelve
years. These longevity records are interesting, but it is not often that
one knows the age of a bird at the time of its arrival.

Dr. Alan Lendon writes that he now expects to arrive in England
by air about 1 oth August. Part of his letter makes melancholy reading.
Owing to the fact that his leisure is constantly shrinking he has found
it necessary to dispose of the major portion of his superb collection of
parrots and parrakeets, and the Doctor very much doubts that he will
be able to indulge in aviculture to anything like the same extent in
the future. This is certainly a sad thought after such a long session
of bird-keeping on the grand scale.

The Hon. Treasurer recommends members living abroad to pay
their subscriptions by money order. It is, however, most important to
notify him of such payments. In many cases the name of remitter does
not appear on the money order, with the result that there is usually
a number of " unidentified " orders in hand. It thus sometimes
happens that a request for payment of subscription is sent to a member
who has already paid by this method but omitted to notify the Hon.

RECORDS OF PARROTS BRED IN CAPTIVITY. By Arthur

A. Prestwick. London, 1950-1952. Price 35s.
The series of six parts which have been published during the last
two years have now been brought together into one volume. The
value of these breeding records has already been stressed in the reviews
of the various parts, and the whole volume is a publication with
which no aviculturist should be without. The book, presented in a
practical and useful form, is printed on one side of the paper
only, making the addition of personal notes an easy matter. In his
acknowledgments of the help he has received from various sources,
in particular that of Miss Kay Bonner, Mr. Prestwich concludes by
saying " I am conscious of extensive gaps in the records of some of
the more popular species. I know perfectly well that there are sources
of information I have been unable to tap and that there have been
many unrecorded successes of which I know nothing. I hope this
present work will open up these sources so that the results may be
embodied in a seventh part--of additions and omissions---now in
preparation."
It is to be hoped that all who read these pages will assist
Mr. Prestwich by sending in any as yet unpublished information
they may have or be able to obtain.

RARE AND EXTINCT BIRDS OF BRITAIN. By Ralph

Whitlock. Phoenix House, Ltd., London. 21s.
Despite its title this book deals with a large majority of the birds on
the British list. In many cases, where no stretch of imagination could
label a species as either rare or extinct, its Continental or Irish race is
considered to qualify for inclusion. The author very properly points
out that sub-species can seldom be identified in the field, but his
separate treatment of them may well mislead the novice. The author
acknowledges his debt to various authorities, and in the reviewer's
opinion the results might have been happier had he followed them
more closely. Many of the author's opinions are worthy of considera-
tion, but two at least, that the Greater Spotted Cuckoo is " a smallish
bird about the size of Skylark ", and that in the Rock Pigeon (Columba
livid) we have " a species of very similar requirements " to the Fulmar,
are ridiculous if intended seriously and most inappropriate in such
a book if they are meant to be funny.
The book is illustrated with excellent photographs, many of which
have appeared in other publications.

THE MANDARIN DUCK. By Christopher Savage. Messrs.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996712581395349" page_id="56291921"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
Adam and Charles Black. London, 1952. Price 25s. net.
That most beautiful of ducks, the Mandrin, has always proved of
great attraction and interest to aviculturists and Christopher Savage's
monograph on this species should make a wide appeal. Mr. Savage
has taken infinite pains to amass a large amount of information about
the Mandarin Duck and to this he has added his personal observations
and studies of the bird in the wild state in Britain. The opening
chapter deals with the history and characteristics of the bird and the
author then continues with an informative account of the Mandarin
Duck in literature and art. In the chapter " The Home of the Mandarin
Duck " he discusses its distribution with great care and marshalls all
the available facts regarding the range of this species, quoting exten-
sively from that great authority on asiatic fauna and flora,
A. C. Sowerby.
Though originally escapes from collections of waterfowl, the
Mandarins have for many years been living in an entirely wild state
in parts of Surrey and Berkshire, where, the author points out, the
country has all the essentials of their natural habitat in the Far East.
Here Mr. Savage has been able to make a close and extensive study of
the birds as is evidenced in his chapters on their autumn and winter
haunts and habits in Britain, spring display, and nesting, and the
brood. Mr. Savage devotes one chapter to discussing the resemblances
and differences in appearance, behaviour, and character of the
Mandarin and Carolina and gives his opinion that the Mandarin
is the most highly developed of all the duck tribe.
In his concluding chapter on the Mandarin Duck in Britain the author
refers to the notable collections in which these birds have been bred
and been kept in large numbers, such as those of the Duke of Bedford,
Mr. Ezra, Messrs. McLean and Wormald, and Lord Grey of Fallodon.
He mentions that the earliest imported was probably by Sir Matthew
Decker, Bt., about the middle of the eighteenth century, and that
in 1834 two were acquired by the London Zoo, since when they have
been kept there almost continuously, and have bred fifty-one times.
An appendix gives a detailed description of the breeding and eclipse
plumage of the adult male, winter and summer plumage of the adult
female, and down of the nestling.
The book is excellently presented with a large number of first-class
half-tone illustrations, a coloured frontispiece by Peter Scott, and
numerous convincing black and white drawings by the author.
Two good maps are included, one showing the distribution (so far
as can be determined) of the Mandarin in the Far East, and the other
showing the breeding colonies, records of winter visitors, and isolated
records of the Mandarin in Great Britain, together with the places

It is a pity that in a book on which so much care and thought
has been expended the Selected Bibliography should contain two
mistakes in the German title of Dr. Lorenz's paper on the behaviour
of the Anatinae, and that the journal quoted for W. de W. Miller's
paper should be a travesty of its proper title.

A WANDERER IN THE WIND--THE ODYSSEY OF AN
ANIMAL COLLECTOR. By Cecil S. Webb. Hutchinson's,
London, 1953. Price 21^. net.
Mr. Webb has had a most adventurous life and to those who have
not been so fortunate in this respect he makes it possible at least to
share these adventures for so graphically written is his book that
the reader is held enthralled for close on 300 pages. Mr. Webb has
visited all the continents of the world and his vivid descriptions
of travels in South Africa, Portuguese East Africa, Indo-China,
Madagascar, British Guiana, Kenya, Tanganyika, Australia, French
Cameroons, India, Gold Coast, Ecuador, and the British Cameroons
are an education in themselves. As Dr. Geoffrey Vevers writes in the
foreword : " His book is packed with solid facts and achievements
and contains many new and original observations on the habits and
physiology of animals. But do not imagine for a moment that it is a
book for zoologists only---it is a book which the general reader will
find intensely interesting and instructive."
Mr. Webb is famous as a naturalist and collector of animals but
in addition to a vast amount of information on natural history and
methods of catching, transporting, and the care of animals, he includes
in his book a great deal of fascinating description of natives' customs,
witch doctors, supersititions, and local tradition. Mr. Webb writes
in a lively and humorous style and all through the book the modesty
of his own achievements is evident. He possesses all the qualities needed
for those who travel in wild places and have to deal with animals,
patience, good humour, initiative, and a quick brain--it is typical of
him that when he was being charged by a mad cow, without a moment's
hesitation he decided to charge the cow !
Mr. Webb's book is of special interest to aviculturists, and he
emphasizes the important part aviculturists can play in the study
of bird life, but he has no use for anyone who does not take proper
care of captive birds and writes : "If the keeping of birds is under-
taken it should be done at the highest level of efficiency or not at all."
Mr. Webb's knowledge of birds of all kinds is quite amazing and
much can be learnt from his book.

BIRDS OF MEXICO. By Emmet Reid Blake, Associate Curator
of Birds at the Chicago Natural History Museum. With numerous
line-drawings by Douglas E. Tibbitts, Staff Artist at the same
institution. 644 pages. Chicago : University of Chicago Press,
1952. $6.00.
For a very long time have we aviculturists felt a dire need for a
practical guide to Mexican birds. While there have been published
now and then books on this very pertinent subject, they have always
been more or less fragmentary, purposely so.
Now comes Curator Blake and gives us almost exactly what we have
been wishing for so very long. His comprehensive work is largely
meant as a guide to identification of birds in the field. As such it may
readily be carried in one's coat pocket, for the 644 pages are very
compactly printed on not very heavy paper.
Aviculturists have, of course, known for a good many years that our
neighbour Mexico boasts of many hundreds of species of birds which
they have never seen in the flesh, and few of them in illustration.
According to the author, no fewer than a thousand species of birds
representing eighty-nine families have been located in Mexico ;
and if subspecies are included in the counting, then the number
of birds totals nearly two thousand. Surely such wealth of bird-
life is found in but few countries, whatever their size and location.
Highly favourable climatic conditions are very conducive to the well-
being of birds in Mexico.
Author Blake writes concerning each of the 967 species in a concise,
informative style that is readily understandable. He begins each account
with a terse description of the bird, gives its distribution, and con-
cludes with remarks regarding females, related species, or whatever
else is needful to complete the data gathered. No information is given
concerning the food requirements of the birds, their nesting, and other
habits, no doubt because the book is meant solely for purposes of
identification in the field.
The line-drawings are well done as a whole, usually portraying
only that particular portion or aspect of the bird likely to be typical
and therefore especially useful for quick and sure identification.
All in all, Author Blake is to be highly commended for the pains-
taking and resultful research which has given us this worthy addition
to the literature of Mexican ornithology. Birds of Mexico is without
question one of the most comprehensive and dependable guides on
the subject yet published.

Bernard Poe. Illustrated. 120 pages, 1953. New York City :
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $2.50.
One of Putnam's nature field books, this very handy little volume
is meant to aid the amateur birdkeeper in maintaining his feathered
charges in good health for many years. To this end the author, a
zoology professor, has made it his business to touch--rather lightly
and often neither expertly nor completely--on varied phases of bird-
keeping. There are sections giving advice on how to buy a bird, how
to keep it healthy, how to sex it, how to feed it, how to train it, etc.
While the advice is for the most part sound, it is frequently very
fragmentary and therefore not a reliable or comprehensive guide to
cage-bird keeping. Some of the " facts " given in the book are obsolete,
as, for instance, the reference to Bird Haven, which firm many years
ago discontinued selling birds. There is a helpful though incomplete
bibliography. There are some line-drawings which help the beginner
to identify certain species. However, their number is very small.
It is quite obvious that any bird enthusiast using this book will, if
he delves into the subject at all thoroughly, very soon find himself
in need of a more comprehensive, detailed, and complete guide to
keeping cage birds. Mr. Poe's work is quite uneven in the treatment of
various subjects, as well as incomplete.

THE BIOLOGY OF BIRDS. By Harry W. Hann, Assistant Pro-

Illustrated. Ann Arbor, Michigan : Ulrich's Book Store. $2.50.
This is a very concise volume into which have been compressed
highly informative, relevant, and factual data concerning every
essential phase of a bird's life and activity. Written in non-technical
language, apparently the outgrowth of a course in ornithology con-
ducted by the author at the University of Michigan, this readable book
is worth the time and effort of every serious bird student, for it provides
him with factual, up-to-date information, the sort of which he is not
likely to obtain in such convenient and concise form in the average
so-called bird book, especially the popular one.
The author opens his treatise with a chapter devoted to the
morphology and physiology of birds, which in turn is followed by other
chapters dealing with bird flight, migration (homing), breeding,
anting, longevity, banding, distribution, conservation, and other
relevant aspects of the subject. Each one is treated very compactly
and quite thoroughly. Frequent references to authentic sources of
information are given in the text, and there are more detailed ones

With reference to Mr. Boosey's criticism of my methods for preventing third nests
of Turquoisines, I have never myself known a healthy hen, properly fed, neglect
the feeding of her well-grown brood simply because the cock had been taken away.
With regard to the risk of young birds damaging themselves seriously when being
caught up, I have also not found this to be great if, as should always be done, a
proper supply of leafy branches has been laid on, or tied to, the dangerous areas of
wire netting in the flight before the brood has flown. Young birds do not crash very
hard against wire netting unless there is an unimpeded view through it.

trace of Sonnerat parentage except for the voice, which was exactly that of Gallus
sonnerati, and it was this distinctive call that drew my attention to the birds.
It would be interesting to know to what extent the call is hereditary and whether
it is the same in Sonnerat's X Domestic as in Domestic X Sonnerat's ; also whether
there is any sign of the eclipse plumage on the neck, characteristic of male Sonnerat's.

(.Psittacula alexandri fas data)
By E. N. T. Vane (Ballinger, Bucks, England)
Generally speaking the Asiatic parrakeets are not as popular with
aviculturists as their Australian counterparts. They compare favour-
ably in colour, shape, and plumage, indeed they excel in the latter,
but they have the disadvantage of being more difficult to sex on the
whole, until the third moult, not so ready to go to nest, and possibly
somewhat noisier.
To all these features there are exceptions, some Australians are
never easy to sex at any age, some can hold their own in vocal power
with almost any living thing on earth, and there are still several yet
to be persuaded to breed in captivity. On the other hand some Asiatics
are readily sexed at a year old, some breed without difficulty, and
some are reasonably quiet in their behaviour. The Moustache is
one of the most attractive birds I have ever kept. Most people probably
think of these birds as the miserable little half-dead creatures that were
at one time freely imported under most unfavourable conditions.
Poor little wretches caught raiding the crops and only saved from
immediate execution because some half-witted European was prepared
to pay money for the thieving little pests. These were nearly all
immature youngsters of the year of an almost uniform green colour
with an absurd caricature of a handlebar moustache, which name
has been appended to them as a permanent reminder of their infirmity.
During the relaxation of the parrot ban comparatively few of these
birds were brought over, and they were evidently not a paying proposi-
tion to the dealer, adults seemed to travel well considering all things,
but young birds died easily.
The appearance of a fully adult pair is really magnificent. One
dealer advertised them as " miniature Derbyans 55 and evoked many
caustic comments from certain people who were indignant that such a

152 E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING OF THE MOUSTACHE PARRAKEET
comparison could even be suggested, but it is in fact quite a justifiable
one. In view of the inaccuracy of some descriptions given in the past
I give a fairly full one of each sex here. These are taken carefully
from living specimens so that allowances must be made for individual
variations, as I can only refer to my own pair and a very few other
specimens I have been able to inspect. In the cock, the head above the
moustachial streak right over the crown is a lovely lavender grey.
There is a black streak from eye to eye along the lores, and over the
nostrils also the characteristic black moustache. The eye has a very
light grey iris which at times appears to be quite yellow. The upper
mandible is red and the lower black. The chest is a pinkish lilac
merging into a pale green belly and abdomen. The nape is an intense
bright green, the remainder of the mantle, back, and wings being
green with a golden yellowish-green patch on the wing. The tail
is green, the central feathers being blue on top and the underside of
the tail being yellowish. The feet are grey.
In the hen the head above the moustache is a pale bluish grey,
much more pale blue than the cock. The iris of the eye is again
yellowish-grey and appears to vary with the light. Mandibles are both
black and she has the same moustachial and eye to eye streaks of black
as the male. The chest is pink and noticeably curls up behind the
black moustache towards the top of the head. Nape bright green.
Mantle, back, and wings green, abdomen pale bluish-green. There
is a faint suggestion of a lighter wing patch but not so pronounced as in
the cock. In size the birds are slightly smaller than the common Ring-
neck, but are not nearly so powerful in flight as the wings are noticeably
shorter and their flight recalls that of a lorikeet.
The young bird is an almost uniform green except for the moustache
and eye streaks, the area between these streaks being grey. There is
no visible wing patch, but the primaries are edged with light yellow
which appears to fade, possibly by attrition. On leaving the nest the
mandibles were both paler red than the cock's upper one, but both
soon darkened and became completely black in a few weeks.
My birds were imported in 1952 shortly after the ban was lifted ;
during that year they were housed in an aviary of modest size and went
to nest, the hen laid eggs and sat, but there was no result owing to the
fact that they were interfered with and she deserted. It was not
surprising, therefore, that when the opportunity to acquire a pair of
birds that had already shown their willingness to breed was offered
to me, I eagerly took advantage of it. As they had been kept indoors
for part of the winter I turned them into an indoor flight of only
about 8 feet in length, where there was no heat. The hen was a
perfect shrew where the cock was concerned, he was not allowed on
the same perch and whatever perch he chose that was the perch on
which she wanted to be. All the time they were indoors they were

remarkably silent, scarcely ever making any noise or uttering any call-
notes ; even when swearing at her partner, the hen only ordered him
off by shoving him with her head and opening her beak at him.
Early in the year, during a mild spell of weather, they were turned
out into an aviary 15 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 6 feet high, con-
structed entirely of steel and facing south. The only shelter was of
asbestos sheet 3 feet square and with its floor 4 feet above ground-
level. It was one of a block of eight flights and their only neighbours
were a pair of Bourkes, whom they entirely ignored throughout the
season. Their flight was at the end of the block, which enabled me to
have one or two very surreptitious inspections during the course of
events. By sliding back an inspection trap with a long stick whilst
the hen was feeding I was able to see the first egg, the young shortly
after hatching, and once or twice whilst growing. The nest box was
an old campaigner, a grandfather clock box of thick timber which
would cost an impossible sum to-day and would most probably have
infringed the timber control regulations then in force. It was filled
from ground level for about 2 feet with earth and topped with some

9 inches of damp peat mould, so that there was a drop inside of some
2 feet from the entrance hole, negotiated by the usual wire netting
ladder.

<bodyText confidence="0.998370583333333" page_id="56291934"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
The food supplied consisted of sunflower, oats, canary, buckwheat,
millet, and hemp. They always selected the sunflower first, though
they were very partial to apples and pears, and were supplied also with
brown bread rusked up and fed crumbly moist. As I have frequently
mentioned previously, all my parrakeets have this addition to their
diet ; almost without exception they relish it immensely, and the
great advantage I find is that through this medium they can be
persuaded to take all kinds of extras such as mineral salts, wheat germ
oil, cod liver oil, or any other tonic it is desired to administer, without
the use of force. Green food consisted of chickweed, poa annua,
dandelion seed, leaf spinach, and later on sow thistle, all supplied
liberally and varied according to season. They also had access to old
mortar grit and cuttle bone. After breeding operations had been com-
pleted successfully, we found that the hen was a most engaging per-
sonality with human beings. She will come right up and accept
titbits from one's fingers, indeed she will soon remind one that she
expects something every time she sees one coming. She is very fond
of green peas, apple, pear, or banana, but she will not allow the cock
to share these delicacies and as he is more stand-offish it is difficult to
give a fair distribution to them because she takes one piece from one's
fingers and whilst one is fixing another on the wire for the cock and
youngster, she consumes her own with indecent haste and then
purloins the other pieces before one can get far enough away to give the
others a chance.

154 E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING OF THE MOUSTACHE PARRAKEET
Almost as soon as they were released into this flight a change in
attitude to each other was noticeable. The hen became quite tolerant
and the cock began to assert himself. For the first time too it became
apparent that they had quite powerful voices and a talent for mimicry,
as they can imitate the calls of the Noble Macaws which are the most
frequently heard in great volume well enough to make one wonder
which bird is creating a disturbance. In the middle of March the
cock was always displaying, and whilst doing so he is a magnificent
bird. He stands on the perch beside the hen, draws his head back-
wards and upwards and keeps bowing to her whilst uttering a song
which can hardly be called a warble, indeed it can hardly be called a
song. But it is perfectly obvious to anyone what he is saying, that is
anyone but the hen ; she is so bored that she nearly dozes off in the
early days, though not for long, and they quite evidently are thoroughly
happy in each other's company.
From the frequency and length of endurance of copulation, I should
say that it was a triumph of achievement on the part of " X " (the
evil spirit of aviculture created by the Duke of Bedford), to succeed
in arranging that two out of the three eggs laid were infertile. However,
that was the result. The hen was first observed to use the box on
23rd March. In early April she began to stay in the box for quite
lengthy periods and the first egg was laid on the 4th, some time
in the evening I believe. From then on she was left very much on
her own, and it was not until the 17th that another chance to look
in was presented, when she had three eggs. Incubation appeared to
start with the first egg, as from the 4th onwards she spent all her time
in the box, although it is impossible to say whether she was generating
sufficient heat to start incubation. She was very suspicious of one's
actions at this time, and if she heard anyone about whilst feeding
she immediately dashed back into the box. Just after sunset on the
3rd May a youngster was definitely heard being fed, which puts
the period of incubation at approximately twenty-eight days. She
brooded the youngster pretty closely, which was just as well seeing
that it was a single bird, but it appeared to thrive without incident.
The progress appeared to be slow, as with other Psittacula, but the
young one could usually be heard making a lusty noise when being
fed. At twenty-five days old it was still downy and without any proper
feathers, and had large black eyes. On the 17th June it was seen
at the nest hole looking out, but it was still frightfully shy and with-
drew immediately it saw anything move. On the 20th it came out
on the platform to be fed whilst it thought it was unobserved, and
it could then be seen that the bill was a pale red. It finally flew on
the 23rd June, fifty-one days after hatching. It roosted out under
cover the first night but the hen went back into the box and I thought
she might go to nest again. The cock also appeared to take this view,

E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING OF THE MOUSTACHE PARRAKEET 1 55
but she soon disillusioned us both on this point and relations between
the pair soon degenerated by degrees back to the old hen-pecked days.
During the whole of the incubation period I did not see the cock
enter the nest, he looked in and called the hen off to feed or be fed,
but that was all. Neither does he feed the young bird, although he
may do so, because I have only very seldom seen either parent actually
pumping food into the youngster, and on each occasion I have done
so it has been the hen, and as soon as they realized they were being
watched they have broken off immediately.
About ten days after leaving the nest, it was noticed that the young
bird's bill was darkening and it was almost entirely black in a month.
The cock was seen to feed the hen occasionally, but he was never given
an opportunity to mate although he seemed to wish to do so. From
the behaviour of the parents I am inclined to think the young bird
is a cock ; the hen always feeds it, and if the youngster worries the cock
for food he promptly drives it away although there is no spite in his
action such as one finds in the Broadtails.
We now have a happy family of Moustache or Banded Parrakeets,
albeit a small one. The hen is delightfully tame, the cock does not
count for much, and the youngster is a lovely little bird. It is most
amusing to watch him try and take a particular tit-bit from one of his
parents ; they both drive him off, but nothing daunts him and he
never fails to secure at least a part of the feast. It is sincerely to be
hoped that it will be possible to establish these delightful birds in
English aviaries as there are quite a few still about.
Although this appears to be a first breeding, it can only be because
there has never been sufficient effort to breed them previously. There
was nothing very difficult in the whole process and I am sure plenty
of others can repeat the performance. If anyone wants to know my
secret for success I am not averse to telling them how it may be done.
It is just like the young man who started out in business on his own
with ten pounds, and recently retired worth a hundred thousand
pounds. He attributed his success in life to hard work and diligence,
perseverance and determination in the face of many difficulties and
the death of a rich uncle who left him #99,990. My rich uncle was
getting the right pair of birds and then giving them the benefit of all
my care, attention, and experience. Anyone else can do the same.

As described above E. N. T. Vane has bred a Moustache, or
Banded Parrakeet (Psittacula alexandri fasciatd ). It is believed that this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to com-

By F. J. Appelman (Rotterdam, Holland)
Until a few years ago the splendid hothouse adjoining the big
Riviera-Hall in the Rotterdam Zoo, contained plants only. However
splendid the collection of tropical and subtropical plants was, only
a comparatively small part of " Blijdorp's 55 visitors showed much
interest, and most of them " did " the hothouse in a few minutes.
Then the Director had an idea : " Why exhibit plants and flowers
without birds, and why exhibit birds without plants and flowers ?
Those gems of Nature, magnificent flowers and beautiful birds, belong
together, and to do them both justice they should be exhibited
together ! "
So a number of smaller and bigger aviaries were built amongst the
orchids, palms, ferns, and many other plants, and when possible the
aviaries themselves were also planted with plants and flowers, the
colours of which were carefully chosen to blend with the colours of
the birds.
The success was overwhelming ; after the birds were taken into their
new surroundings, the hothouse, formerly only visited by few people,
was always crowded with visitors, who proved they appreciated this
splendid combination of exotic birds amidst exotic plants which up
till then had been rarely seen. And how did the birds do ? We can
only say : extremely well !
It is pointed out that before the new arrangement, it had already
been observed that tropical birds moult much easier, faster, and
better in hot and humid surroundings than in colder and drier places.
Never were our Macaws finer in spring than after wintering in the
hothouse. Moreover, we installed combined self-registering ther-
mometer-hygrometers, and made sure that we arranged in the hot-
house the same, or about the same, climatic conditions that prevail
in the rain-forests in the tropics.
To check the hothouse " climate " we have the average daily
temperature and moisture curves of certain places in Indonesia on the
registration-strip and try to keep our hothouse-curves as closely as
possible to this curve.
It is our opinion that a little difference in the temperature and
humidity does not matter so much, but that the course of the curves
is most essential. Therefore we are content if the course of our hot-
house-curves runs more or less parallel and not too far away from the
standard-curves (see illustration).* Amongst the birds successfully
* It should be understood that for our control we use the average daily tempera-
ture- and moisture-curve that prevails during the year ; so we do not take in account
the different seasons (monsoons).

kept in this way are : Ibises, Birds of Paradise (six species), Jacanas,
Nicobar Pigeons, Gouras, Ocellated Turkeys, Radjah Sheld-Duck,
Brazilian Teal, Toucans, Tanagers, and many smaller birds.
Of course, at this moment we cannot say that we have solved the
problem entirely, as our experiment has only been in operation for one
and a half years. All we can say is that until now we have suffered
only minor losses, and that the birds are doing extremely well. They
are in fine condition and very lively, loudly calling and signalling to
each other. Some even started breeding, e.g. the Crowned Wood-
partridge (Rollulus roulroul), from Sumatra, known as a bird that is
not too easy to keep in captivity.
It should be understood, however, that this way of keeping and
showing birds is rather expensive. It is, of course, hardly possible
to keep parrakeets in this way, as they will ruin all plants in a few
hours. But even small seed-eating birds do a lot of harm to the plants.
Best fitted to live in harmony with flowers are insect-eating birds
and, to a certain degree, fruit-eating birds, but even these soil flowers
and leaves with their droppings, so that the planting of the aviaries
has to be changed at least every two weeks or even more often. This
necessitates keeping in stock a large number of plants, shrubs, and
trees, which also means a lot of work for the gardeners !
But in any event we are sure that our idea : " Show your animals
in beautiful surroundings ; keep birds and flowers together 5 5 is
highly appreciated by the visitors, and cannot fail to teach the public
the sense of beauty, harmony, and love for Nature's inexhaustible
treasures, which is one of the first aims and duties of a modern Zoo.

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Bucks, England)
44 Nothing very remarkable about that," I can hear you say. 44 Lots
of people have bred them " ! That, however, Reader, is just where
you are mistaken for no one, not even Dame Nature herself, has
bred this particular kind of Green Ringneck !
Sexing immature Ringnecks by their appearance is always a bit
difficult, for although hens show slightly more yellow in the iris of the
eye than cocks, the difference is not very great, and the more closely
you examine a lot of young birds the more confused are you likely
to become. It came about, therefore, that what I had for some time
believed to be a pair of two-year-old blue Ringnecks turned out to
be two cocks, judging by their behaviour as the breeding season
approached. As I already had a certain hen, this left me with a
spare cock and I decided, if possible, to mate him to a lutino in the
hope of breeding something which might even be split for white.
By rather unusual good fortune I did get hold of a lutino hen which
was said to have bred--quite a good bird, save that the ends of some
of her toes were missing, doubtless because her owner had not taken
the precaution to avoid exposing her feet to severe frost.
When I introduced the two birds to one another, although the
blue cock had shown signs of being in breeding condition, their
attitude of surprise and alarm was not exactly promising. As on a
previous occasion when I had put a blue and a lutino Ringneck together,
the reaction of each bird seemed to be 44 Good heavens ! I never saw
such an extraordinary-looking object ! " As, however, they did not
seem disposed actually to fight, I decided to leave them together and
see what happened. After a while the blue cock showed some desire
to make advances to the hen, but for a time he met with a very chilly
reception. When he walked up to her in the consequential manner
which is part of a Ringneck's display, she simply ignored him, gazing
into the distance as though he did not exist. Only if he actually
touched her and offered to feed her did she open her beak at him in an
ill-natured way. In the past she had doubtless had a mature green or
lutino husband with a well-developed ring and the ringless, two-
year-old " Little Boy Blue " seemed to her a most inferior substitute.
Some time later I noticed the blue cock examining the nest-box, but
as the hen's attitude towards him remained chilly and distant, it was
with some surprise that one morning, finding no sign of her, either in
the aviary shelter or in the flight, I realized that she must be in the
nest itself. After that things began to look more promising, and in
due course it became apparent that the lutino was sitting. Some

weeks later I saw the cock emerging from the box--an almost certain
sign that the young had hatched. How is it, I wonder, that parrakeet
fathers are made aware so quickly of the birth of their children when
the latter are still so tiny and feeble that they can hardly make any
audible noise ? Do their wives manage to tell them and, if so, how
is it done ? I remember some time ago reading a charming account
of observations made at the nest of a pair of breeding partridges,
which included a description of the way in which the hen drew her
mate's attention to the arrival of their first-born child, with the result
that he became so wild with excitement and delight and cut such
capers that he could not even see where he was going and ran into
a tree ! Thereafter things progressed in an uneventful and satisfactory
manner in the Ringneck family. Judging by the amount of food
consumed, however, the brood was not a large one, and in due course
when two nice young ones left the nest, this proved to be the case.
As I rather expected, they are green, but I imagine, if they are sex-
linked, that both cocks and hens are split for blue and the young
cocks, if mated to blues, might even produce some albino daughters.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
The current breeding season has had its high and low points.
Certainly there were times when one wondered about " birds
inhumanity to man " for some pairs only tantalized us with
expectations.
Our famed (unusual) California weather stayed with us the entire
season. From January to March it was summer--with day after day
of sunshine and clear skies. It turned out that this was our mildest
winter in many years and also one of the driest, as we had very little
rain. As a result many birds came into fine breeding condition by
March, when dull grey skies and cool damp weather became the
order of the day. This seemed to cause indecision in our feathered
friends, leaving them wondering whether they should nest, moult, or
drop dead. In the end they did just that--some moulted in March,
some nested, and some just gave up and died.
The failures and sad news department we'll cover first. Stanley
Rosellas, always my favourite Rosella, proved again a disappointment.
Though I have had Stanleys for twelve years, I have never been
very successful with them. The season started with three pairs, and
the hen to one of the pairs gave up, forever, the idea of increasing
California's Stanley population, for she was found dead one morning
for no apparent cause. The other two hens immediately started to

D. M. WEST-BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1 953 IN CALIFORNIA 1 6 1
make up for her demise by starting large families. One hen laid eight
eggs and the other hen laid a clutch of nine. After this strenuous
effort one hen sat very half-heartedly for about ten days, and then
deserted, and the other hen never did decide to incubate, though
I will say, in her defence, she faithfully checked her eggs daily and
would sit on them for a half hour or so each day. It was most unfortu-
nate that we had nothing to transfer the eggs to--and so the result
was a large nothing for the Stanleys. Better luck next year ?
Crimson-wings, always rare in California, were very tiresome.
A young male disapproved of his mate and luckily we were able to
provide another one that he immediately accepted. Though she
looked in the nest and even sat in the nest for a few days, nothing
eventuated. As he was just a two-year-old cock this was rather to be
expected. This pair took great interest in the matrimonial affairs
of all the other birds, even to looking in the nest of a pair of Silver
Zebras housed with them. As the Zebras did not seem to object, it
made little difference, and the Zebras just kept right on raising large
families carefully supervised by the Crimson-wings. A second pair
of Crimson-wings scrapped all fall and winter, but became very
friendly during April. With none of the usual nest-box inspection
you find in the Rosellas, she laid two eggs quite suddenly, and then
never visited the nest again. I placed the eggs under some Cockatiels
who successfully hatched the one fertile egg, but would not feed the
chick. We hand-fed it for ten days and then found the youngster
dead one morning for no apparent reason. Quite to our surprise the
female laid again (two eggs) and though she sat faithfully the eggs
were clear. The San Diego Zoo is quite successful with this species.
Red Lories visited the nest-box and mated, but nothing further
eventuated. The female is probably too young, for she was in juvenile
plumage when obtained. This pair were raised in Arizona by
Mr. Sheffler. These Lories are always particularly annoyed when the
lawns are mowed. They very noisily object, hanging by the wire
and scolding. This pair are permanently frustrated by their futile
attempts to kill a neighbouring pair of Pileated--whom they especially
seem to resent.
A pair of Black-winged Lories also mated, but no nest was provided
for them as the hen was in a very bad moult and we rather wondered
if raising a family would help her tacky appearance. The Black-wings
are certainly much more quiet than the Red Lories. This pair also
is from Arizona.
Turquoisines had three clutches of clear eggs. This is a surprise
as they are in a large portable aviary and are a handsome three-
year-old pair. Turquoisines have the unhappy habit of being very
scrappy--a fault the other Neophema happily lack.
Brown's Rosellas showed great interest, but this pair were intro-

duced very late and they fell into an early moult. This pair fortu-
nately seem well-disposed towards each other--which has not been
the case with most of the Brown's Rosellas here in California.
A male Stanley mated to a female Blue Rosella did not even display
to her, and both birds seemed quite contented just to sit the season out.
Blue-bonnets laid and sat very well, but all six eggs were clear.
Of the four pairs, only one laid, and the other three pairs just visited
the box and looked interested. A male Many colour mated to a female
Blue-bonnet did nothing and was found dead one morning with
a broken neck.
Blue India Ringnecks proved interesting. Although I should have
known better, I had rather expected this mutation to be a cobalt blue.
I was tremendously surprised to find they are an unusually lovely
light blue--what we here in California call a " sky-blue " or " powder
blue ". The sex of the first two birds posed an interesting problem,
and one that was difficult to solve, since they were very nervous, and
upon seeing anyone watching them would immediately retreat into
their shelter--not to reappear for some time. Finally, during March,
they did some displaying, and when a nest-box was hung their actions
left no doubt they were a pair. The nest-box was removed after
we were sure of their sex, for they began a very heavy moult which
lasted an unusually long time. They eat a tremendous amount of
fruit daily, and each day a large apple and orange are given, and by
the following morning nothing is left. They also proved tremendously
fond of the young buds and flower buds of fruit trees of plum, peach,
and apricot, and as they grew more confiding would fly down (while
we watched) to their daily branch of peach and apricot. They made
a very fine display as they crawled about among the pink and white
blossoms. For Ringnecks they are quiet--at least in comparison to
some I had years ago.
A second pair of blue Ringnecks were an obvious pair from the
first and were always confiding and steady. They are all very fond
of ripe corn (on the cob) and will easily eat an ear a day.
It might be interesting to note that prior to 1950 there were no
lutino Ringnecks in the United States. However, in that year a zoo
imported a small breeding nucleus of eight lutino and lutino-bred
Ringnecks for study. These have prospered and as a result some
lutino Ringnecks are being raised every year. Even so they are still
very scarce in this country and are still too rarely seen.
Many California breeders have told me quite definitely that, in
their experience, the young male Ringnecks will obtain their ring at
from sixteen to eighteen months. This is not the case with European
birds, judging from the printed references.
Barraband's did nothing, though they always looked like they
intended to raise a family. Both pairs displayed, fed, and mated,

and looked into their nest-boxes, but eventually did nothing. They
are great favourites of mine, and their friendly and comical ways
are a joy.
Yellow Rosellas also looked at their box but got no further. They
are surprisingly tame and friendly, and ever ready to fly to the wire
for a piece of grass or a nut. One male appears to have sore feet
and the ankles seem to be swollen. Does anyone have suggestions on
what should be done to help this bird ?
&amp;apos; On the sunny side of the account the really outstanding numerical
success of the season was 16 young Bourkes from three breeding
pairs. The first pair deserted two fertile clutches of eggs and then
started a third clutch. When the third clutch also was deserted (why,
I don't know) I was able to save the fertile eggs, and these were given
to a spinster Nyasa Lovebird who raised one young Bourke for about
three weeks when the Bourke was removed and hand-fed. A second
pair showed no signs of nesting until very late in the season, when the
hen suddenly retreated to her nest-box and reared a fine brood of
four. The third pair really did themselves proud, and from three
nests they reared eleven (5, 4, 2) without any trouble or fuss. They
actually would have started a fourth clutch if the nest-box had not
been removed. This pair was in a large cage with the pair of Barra-
band's and the male Bourke never hesitated to do battle with the
Barraband's who always obligingly retreated before his determined
attacks ! These battles were always short, and the Bourkes made no
objection to the Barraband's sitting on top of their nest-box. I was
especially interested to note that the Bourkes would eat the (cracked)
sunflower seed that the wasteful Barraband's would drop in the sun-
flower bowl. This doubtless helped the young Bourkes to be the really
fine specimens they are.
Manycolours were successful again this year. One pair raised
seven (4, 3) in two nests, while a second pair, composed of a fine
male and a very nervous hen, did not fare so well. Their first nest
of four fertile eggs was given to a very trustworthy Redrump hen,
who duly hatched them and let them all die ! A second nest of three
youngsters was deserted--and though they were hand-fed they never
prospered, and died one by one. A third pair did not nest.
A very lovely pair of Pileated (with a long five year record of
failures and desertions) hatched a single youngster which was success-
fully hand-raised. It is a very tame and confiding bird^-as most
hand-raised Pileated are. A second pair of Pileated were too young
to nest, although the year-old cock did display and call to the hen.
All the African Lovebirds did well. Peachface, Fischer's, Nyasas,
Black and Blue Masked, all raised good numbers of fine youngsters.
Of especial interest were the lutino Nyasas. These are really
extremely beautiful with their golden bodies and pink heads. We had

a single lutino male and one (purported) split cock to start the season.
These two males were placed with three known young females early
in the season. The split (?) cock raised five young (3, 2), and the
lutino male and his mate raised seven (1, 6). All the twelve young
were greens, but they have been carefully segregated and some of them
at least must be splits, so it does give us some good stock for next year.
The second nest of six the male lutino had, was considered too large,
and so the extra hen Nyasa was given two of his fertile eggs and duly
reared them. This spinster situation was interesting because at
various times both males entered her nest, but none of the many eggs
she laid proved fertile. Nyasas are very fond of greens and ours also
eat large quantities of apples and oranges, along with soaked bread
while rearing young. At the time of these notes (July) both pairs of
the Nyasas again have eggs, so the total number of young for the
season is still uncertain. I have not observed the cock helping to build
the nest--the female doing all the work by carrying the nesting
material in her beak. I put in a fresh palm frond each week for them
--and this has proven most satisfactory for nesting material.
Scarlet-chested did very poorly. Of four pairs one was too young,
one had two sets of clear eggs, one pair raised two, and the other three.
Rather disappointing as they are usually very dependable.
Princess Alexandras also did very poorly. We started the season
with five pairs, but one of the females died early in the season and
we could not replace her. Of the remaining four pairs, one pair did
not nest at all ; one pair reared a single but very fine only child ; one
pair had four fertile eggs that failed to pip and a second nest of clear
eggs ; and the fourth pair reared two very fine youngsters. The
father of the two youngsters just mentioned is a blue sport, and is
one of the loveliest birds I have ever seen. The pink throat and tail
in the normal bird are replaced with white, while the body is blue-
grey and the wings the loveliest sky-blue. This is a very fine large
male, very vigorous and tame. Last year he was mated to a good
hen, and though they were actually observed to mate, she did not
nest. This year he mated to a proven hen who immediately laid
five eggs. Of the five one was clear, two failed to pip, and two were
hatched and raised. These two youngsters are normally coloured,
but are split for the blue factor. The two young are thought to be
a pair.
Cockatiels did exceptionally well, five pairs raising over fifty
youngsters without any trouble. A few (seven) lutino Budgies were
raised from an albino cock and a female lutino.
For many years I have been an increasingly strong advocate of
feeding fruit to all the birds we keep. In addition to the various
standard grains (hemp, oats, sunflower, millet, canary) mixed in
varying proportions depending upon the season and the bird, I
</bodyText>

D. M. WEST-BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1 953 IN CALIFORNIA 1 65
find that every bird we have seems to look forward to the daily
fruit ration.
A most satisfactory and economical method of providing fruit is
this method which we have evolved over a period of time. Since
most of the smaller birds will only eat a quarter of an apple and
orange a day, I cut the fruit into quarters (first being sure to wash the
fruit carefully to remove any sprays, etc., growers might have used),
and then impale the fruit on a nail in the aviary. This holds the fruit
firmly in place and prevents it from being dropped on the floor and
being wasted. It is easiest to impale the fruit if you drive the nail
in upside down--so that the fruit does not have to pass over the
head of the nail. In short--instead of driving the nail from the top
of the wood downwards, place the nail so that the point of the nail
comes up through the wood, thus giving you a sharp point. This
will hold the fruit firmly in place and makes it easy for the birds to eat.
For each cage I drive four nails. Because some pairs fight over
food, I drive them in sets of two, placing the two sets a few feet apart.
This prevents squabbles--also when the pair has young, more fruit
may be desirable, and the added nails make it easy to provide the
additional fruit. We have found that when the fruit is cut into
quarters the birds find it easier to eat than if it were halved.
The large birds as Kings, Barraband's, and the like, all get one-
half of an orange and one-half of an apple each day. The smaller
JVeophema , Agapornis , Psephotus will do nicely with the quarters.
During the entire year I feed apples and oranges as part of the daily
feeding routine. During the summer all the birds receive fresh corn
on the cob. With corn it is very important to start out gradually
with only small sections of the cob for this precaution will avoid any
possible bowel upsets. I have seen such small birds as the finches
and the Budgies work very diligently on the corn in order to get the
kernels. Summer brings figs and most birds enjoy the figs which I
secure from our tree when they are very ripe. The lories will eat
the melons as cantaloupe, water melon, and most of the seed-eating
birds will like the seeds from cantaloupe, etc., when dried. All the
psittacine birds love with a wild passion pomegranates. In the fall
these are readily obtainable at very reasonable prices, and I split
these open, and the birds will fly all about one when this treat is
brought to their aviary. As the tree bears profusely here in California,
one could easily grow one's own supply. The one drawback with this
fruit is that it is very likely to stain the bird's plumage--and so in no
time at all your Barrabands have a reddish breast and some might
object to this fruit for that reason.
So many people say to me that they tried fruit and the birds didn't
touch it. This is doubtless true--the Agapornis will sometimes
take a month before they will start to eat the fruit and Bourkes

1 66 D. M. WEST--BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1953 IN CALIFORNIA
and Budgies even longer. I just continue to give it until they start to
utilize the fruit.
A second complaint one frequently hears is that only a small
portion is eaten. One should consider the small capacity a pair of
Elegants or Bourkes will have. For example, in one aviary this
season there were five Nyasas, and they would just barely finish
their daily ration of a quarter of an apple and orange. It is quite
true that they 44 wasted " some by not eating all of the apple and
orange--but the important thing is not that they did not eat all of it,
but instead that their diet was enriched by the addition of apple and
orange. Anyone who keeps birds has a duty to see to it that they are
kept under the most desirable conditions possible--and possibly the
addition of fruit will enrich their life.
At any rate I firmly believe that the aviculturist's chances of rearing
young are greatly increased when the pair has had access to fruit
during the year. I believe that the use of fruit results in better plumage
and healthier adult birds and youngsters--end of sermon !
Greens are a problem too. Branches of trees such as the fruit trees,
apricots, peaches, plum, and elm are always appreciated, but it
would take a small forest to do this very frequently. I have found
that a most satisfactory shrub is the pyracantha, a member of the
cotoneaster family. Besides being a mass of bloom in the spring, the
red berries are lovely during the fall and winter. Best of all is the
fact that all the birds will eat the berries at any time during the year.
Here in California the native birds are so fond of them that it is
a task to keep enough of them for your aviary birds.
Another green that is very satisfactory is chard. The stalks are
relished by all the birds, and it now comes in a very nice cherry red
colour, so the plant is not unsightly. When the plants bolt to seed,
the birds are very fond of the seeds when still green. This plant is
easily grown and quite long lasting.
Bread. Although the staff of life for man, many here consider it of
doubtful value for birds. Personally I feel that it is a very good weekly
addition to the diet--and a necessity when parents are with young.
I use a dark whole-wheat bread which has first been dried in the sun.
Over this I pour water (some use milk) and give to the birds with
families. It must be a great help to the parents, for they are always
there waiting for it when there is a hungry family under hand.
If one is not satisfied with bakery bread it would be a relatively
easy task to bake one's own bread using some of the specially prepared
health flours now on the market. At least a few people I have talked
to are doing this very thing and are quite satisfied with the results.

<bodyText confidence="0.992204" page_id="56291950"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
By J. Dalborg-Johansen (Odense, Denmark)
In July, 1948 ,1 got a lovely pair of Green-rumped Parrotlets (Forpus
passerinus passerinus ) from Holland. I put them into a small indoor
aviary in my birdroom, together with Parrot Finches (Red-headed
and Three-coloured) and some Waxbills. They went to nest im-
mediately and reared three youngsters, and after this the Green-
rumped bred regularly every year, with two or three broods.
In 1949 I got a pair of Blue-rumped (Forpus passerinus flavissimus ),
but unfortunately they turned out to be two males. I had them for
a year and constantly tried to find females, but it was impossible to get
any. Then I--in spite of disliking parrot hybrids--mated each of
them to a Green-rumped hen. Both pairs were placed in single cages
with a nest-box outside, entrance-hole towards the window. They
paired up willingly, and a fortnight later both hens were sitting, each
on six eggs. All the eggs were fertile, one hatched five, the other
four chicks, and all nine were fledged.
The hybrids were all nice and fully feathered birds, the young hens
were exactly like their mothers, and the young cocks were less blue
on the rump than their fathers, but after their first moult most of
them turned out quite as blue. I, and other aviculturists, have picked
them up and looked at them side by side with the old cocks and
we could not see any difference between them. It is curious, as the
pure Green-rumped cocks are easy to distinguish, with the lack of
blue on the rump, less blue on the wings, and they are smaller.
Last year we imported some pure Blue-rumped Parrotlets to this
country, but it seems to me that the hens of both pure species and the
hybrids are all alike. I have discussed this with Mr. C. af Enehjelm,
and he is of the same opinion. I should be very glad to hear if anyone
in England can see any difference.
After their first broods the two " mixed " pairs had two and three
broods with respectively three and three, and three, two, and four
youngsters.
Now this year (1953) both pairs are again rearing families, this time
they have big clutches--six and seven young ones, and I have heard
from some of the aviculturists, who got young " hybrid " pairs here
last year, that they have bred too, and their offspring are just as
" blue-rumped " as their parents.
Incubation time for both pure Green-rumped and Green-rumped X
Blue-rumped Parrotlets is 21-23 days, the young ones are fledged in
about thirty days and can be separated from the parents a fortnight

1 68 A. A. PRESTWICH A TUDOR BIRD-CAGE
my birdroom last year, which unfortunately I can't say were successful.
The first was with a pair of Red-faced Lovebirds (Agapornis pullaria)
that dug a nesthole in an horizontal parrakeet box (completely filled
with peatmoss for the purpose) and laid three eggs, which were all
fertile, but the young were dead in the shell. It seems to me, that the
hen's sitting was not steady enough, she was too often outside the
box with the cock, who very seldom went into the nest. But never-
theless, I have not been so near success with this species before.
The other pair, who made an attempt to breed, was a pair of Red-
bellied Conures (Pyrrhura frontalis). I got them in May, and as I was
short of aviaries I placed them in an empty lovebird cage, not more
than 60 cm. long, and with a nest-box outside. The birds immediately
occupied the nest-box and enlarged the entrance hole with their
strong beaks. The birds were very nervous and jumped into the
box at the faintest noise in the birdroom, and therefore I saw them
very seldom. After a month or so, I thought of transferring them to
a better and larger cage, and was indeed very astonished to find the
hen sitting. In the nest were four eggs placed on a support of wood-
shavings. Two of the eggs were hatched, one young one died nearly
at once, but the other one lived for three weeks, but was then killed
by one of the parents. Perhaps the cause was the too small nest-box
in conjunction with their great nervousness.
As usual with our fascinating hobby, we must say, better luck
next time.

A TUDOR BIRD-CAGE
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
Our member Martin Luther, the well-known collector of antiques
and bygones, has recently unearthed the bird-cage illustrated, and it
has now been added to my collection.
The base measures 17 \ inches by 11 inches, and the overall height
is 17 inches. The panels on either side of the " balcony " are not
glass, as one might expect, but mirrors. Consequently, while inside
any bird would have been in very subdued light as, apart from
openings in the sides, presumably intended for food and water
receptacles, there is no other means of lighting the interior.
Nothing is known of the history of this cage. We assume the period
is Tudor, and I would be grateful if any reader could determine the
approximate date. I would also like to have suggestions regarding
the species most likely to have been kept in it.

By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent)
As it seemed to me that there has been quite enough of E. J.
Boosey in the magazine of late, I intended to have given this number
a miss. However, I recently received such an urgent plea for copy
from our Editor, saying she was really worried about the next number,
that I felt I must try and concoct an article of some kind.
Incidentally, may I add my plea that more of our members would
contribute to the Magazine, thereby greatly lightening our Editor's
load, as well as increasing the general interest of the Magazine ? It
may be that some people who only keep the commoner species think
that members would not be interested in articles about these. In this,
however, I believe they are entirely wrong, for while I think people
like reading about rarities, I think many probably like even more
reading and mentally comparing notes about birds which they
themselves keep.
As I could think of nothing else to write about at the moment,
I am giving a short account of a new colour-variety of the Zebra
Finch, and also of two other recent arrivals at Keston.
A few weeks ago we received a consignment from Australia con-
sisting of ten pairs of a new colour variety of the Zebra Finch, which
were sent over as " Marked White Zebra Finches " which describes
them tolerably well, but we have called them Chestnut-flanked White
Zebra Finches.
They are quite distinct and most attractive, being pure white with
the normal form's black markings dark slate-grey, and the white-
spotted chestnut patches on the sides of the breast clearly visible, though
much paler ; in fact they are rather like a Silver Zebra Finch with the
silver areas replaced by white. Quite a good idea of their appearance
can be obtained from the accompanying photograph of one of our
breeding pairs at Keston.
We sold six pairs, and of the four we retained, one hen died and was
replaced by a White to find out which is dominant. The latter are
sitting, and, of the three pairs of Chestnut-flanked Whites, one pair
is sitting ; the second pair have young in the nest ; and the third
pair have a brood of two just fledged ; the third young one having
fallen, or been thrown, out of the nest at a tender age.
The newly-fledged young are white with greyish heads, which will
presumably fade to white when they come into adult colour. As
far as we are aware, these are the first Chestnut-flanked Whites to be
bred in this country.
Other new arrivals of interest are about a dozen specimens of the

Javan race ( Munia ferruginosa) of the much better-known White-
headed Mannikin or " Maja Finch " ( Munia maja ).
These are the first of the Javan race we have ever had, and they
are prettier as well as rather smaller than their better-known relative.
The ordinary White-headed Mannikin is, of course, merely deep
chocolate-brown with a whitish head and neck and silvery beak,
but the Javan race has a silver-grey head and neck, and its appearance
is much enhanced by the fact that it has a large bib on the throat and
upper breast, of so deep a brown as to appear almost black, which
adds contrast, and makes it considerably the more beautiful bird of
the two.
We also recently received two specimens of the Speckled-fronted
Weaver ( Sporopipes frontalis) --again a bird we have never had before--
although we have often imported its near relative the Scaly-crowned
Weaver ($. squamifrons ).
In Aviculture , Vol. I, we read of the Sporopipitiae : " This group is
composed of two little birds, often kept in captivity, which slightly
resemble the Waxbills." They are described as follows :
The Speckled-fronted Weaver {S. frontalis) : " The forehead and top
of the black head are finely dotted with white, as well as the slight
moustache. The nape and sides of the neck are cinnamon ; the body
above ashy brown, the cheeks and underparts pale beige, beak and
legs whitish. It is about the same size as an Orange Bishop, only
with a longer tail."
The Scaly-crowned Weaver (S. squamifrons) : "Is considerably
smaller than the preceding, which it resembles, the only difference
being that the general colour is less tawny, the wing coverts and
black-brown tail are bordered with white, the crown and the
moustache have white lines instead of dots. The habits are the same.
This species is more frequently imported than the other and has
nested in captivity."
I should have said myself that squamifrons is far more often imported
than frontalis , and that the former has little if any tawny in its plumage,
being mainly a white, black, and grey bird.
The better-known of the two, the Scaly-crowned Weaver, is found
in the Union of South Africa, while the Speckled-fronted Weaver
is a bird of Western and Equatorial Africa, and is found as far north
as Timbuctoo in the Sahara Desert country.
Both are lovers of dry conditions, the Scaly-crowned being found
particularly in the region of the Kalahari Desert.
Nobody, seeing these birds for the first time, would imagine for one
moment that they were Weavers, as their shape and general appear-
ance is entirely finch-like. Yet that they are true Weavers is obvious
from the fact that they construct a spherical nest typical of the family,
woven of fine grasses and with a short pointed tunnel-shaped entrance.

E. BOOSEY-RECENT ARRIVALS AT KESTON I 7 I
In conclusion, I thought it would be of interest to record some of
the things Alan Lendon, over here from Australia, told me when he
recently paid a very welcome visit to our farm.
The trouble is that he is such a mine of information on the subject
of Australian birds, that it is difficult mentally to digest all he tells
one during a visit consisting of a single afternoon and evening, so
if any of my facts are not entirely accurate--that must be my excuse.
Apparently--as perhaps one would only expect--we in this country
are far behind in the way of colour varieties of Australian birds.
One of the most interesting things he told me was that he had seen
a blue Princess of Wales Parrakeet, which has since been sold for a
very large sum to an American. I gather that there is a good deal
of fawn-colour in the plumage, the greener parts of which are bluish,
while the pink areas on the cheeks and throat are whitish. The
bird, however, must be very beautiful, as the large light green patches
on the wings are replaced by bright sky blue.
Then there are both lutino and cinnamon Rosellas, of which
Lendon told me he had only seen the former. These must be
very beautiful, retaining, I think I am right in saying, the red
areas as is usually the case with the lutino editions of birds that
have red in the plumage. I gather that these are not just isolated
specimens, but that both lutino and cinnamon Rosellas are being
bred in aviaries in Australia.
Then, too, there are yellow Gouldian Finches (quite distinct, of
course, from the rare yellow-headed bird), as well as white Diamond
Doves. The former sound rather attractive, as it appears that they
retain, to a certain degree, the red of the head, and also the purple
of the upper breast in contrast to their yellow body-colour. The
latter may also be attractive, but I personally have never been able
to appreciate an all-white edition of any bird that is so beautifully
marked as the Diamond Dove.

DARENTH-HULME, 1953
By Kay Bonner (Southgate, England)
A few notes on our birds may prove of interest, perhaps more
especially to members overseas, as indicative of the psittacines available
to English aviculturists.
The main aviaries consist of a range of eighteen houses 4 feet wide,
3 feet deep, with a sloping roof 4 feet high in front and 3 feet at the
back, standing on legs, the floor being raised 3 feet from the ground ;
attached are 30-feet flights, 6 ft. 6 in. high. The occupants of these
aviaries are

in July during a particularly wet spell of weather. One,
unfortunately, apparently struck its head and through lying
in wet grass for some hours developed an enteritis. It was
taken over to E. N. T. Vane, and he, with his usual diligence,
succeeded in hand-rearing it, and it is now quite a nice bird.

7. Abyssinian Lovebirds. Three pairs have toyed with the idea of
nesting, but have failed to produce any offspring.
8. Fischer's Lovebirds. A small breeding colony succeeds in
maintaining itself, but only just. We did not find this species
entirely hardy last winter and there were several losses.
9. Barraband's Parrakeets.
10. Cactus Conures and a single Weddell's Conure ; one of the
latter died during the winter.
11. St. Thomas Conures, five.

18. A pair of Cissas.
Running along the back of the shelters there is a service passage
and wilderness aviary, giving a flight 72 feet long and 10 feet wide.
The occupants are three pairs of Purple-headed Glossy Starlings
and a pair of Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons. The Starlings have
shown not the slightest inclination to breed. The Pigeons, on the
other hand, were only too anxious to do so. In spite of continual
interference on the part of the Starlings they eventually managed to
rear two young.
An escape passage and planted aviary, 7 ft. 6 in. wide, stretches
along the front of the flights. The sole tenants of this are, at present,
an aged and somewhat decrepit pair of Peach-faced Lovebirds.
An adjoining aviary, 24 feet by 18 feet, contains a colony of about
two dozen Red-faced Lovebirds. I would have liked to describe
it as a breeding colony, but such is far from being the case. There
has been a certain amount of excavation, but not a single egg.
The chalet-type bird-room houses a pair of Vane's 1951 Noble
Macaws ; two pairs of Golden-winged Parrakeets ( Brotogeris chrysop-
terus) ; a pair of Canary-winged Parrakeets ; a pair of Maximilian's
Parrots ; an Orange-bellied Senegal Parrot ( Poicephalus senegalus
versteri) ; and half-a-dozen Red-faced Lovebirds, mostly with clipped
wings. A house, 10 feet wide by 6 feet, with flight attached, contains
a pair of White-bellied Caiques.
We keep a number of pairs of the commoner Pheasants--Golden,
Silver, Amherst, Chinese, Reeves'. The nine pens are mostly 22 feet
wide by 17 feet, but there is one 22 feet by 42 feet. The shelters
are made of wattle hurdles and look quite attractive. Pigeons share
most of the enclosures and live in perfect amity with the pheasants,
if not with themselves. We have Bronze-winged, Brush Bronze-winged,
Triangular-spotted, and, of course, Java and Barbary Doves. All
these have bred successfully with the exception of the Triangular-
spotted, whose chief delight appears to be fighting. When, having
wintered together, two pairs were not separated sufficiently early in
the spring a battle-royal ensued during which one was killed and
another severely injured. A pair, however, now has two young ones
ten days old.
Having suffered depredation by semi-feral cats we had Wolseley
Electric Fencing installed round the entire grounds and this has
proved a very satisfactory deterrent.
Finally, the house parrots consist of a pair of Greys, three Senegals,
a Ruppell's, and a Brown-headed ( Poicephalus cryptoxanthus ).

Of the birds received during the past two months, three are new
to the collection. They are a White-breasted Warbling Finch ( Poospiza
melanoleuca) ; a Sunda Islands Myna ( Gracula verierata) , and the Uganda
Green-headed Sunbird ( Cyanomitra verticalis viridisplendens ).
The first is an interesting bird with rather the appearance of a tiny
Shrike and of an inquisitive disposition. The Myna is of the genus
formerly known as Eulabes and quite closely related to the familiar
Nepal and Southern Hill Mynas. The Sunbird is the eastern form
of the Green-headed of tropical West Africa. This specimen was
presented, together with five Red-chested Sunbirds ( Nectarinia
erythroceria) , by Mr. D. Roberts of the East African Fisheries Research
Organization in Uganda. A Kingfisher ( Alcedo atthis ispida ) has also
been presented.
A Malayan (or Malaccan) Peacock Pheasant ( Polyplectron malac-
censis) and a Malayan Argus ( Argusianus argus) have been presented
by the Chief Game Warden of Malaya. A Funereal Cockatoo ( Calypto -
rhynchus funereus ), the first to be exhibited since 1931 ; a pair of the
pretty Cuban Blue-headed Pigeons, or Quail-doves ( Starnoenas cyano -
cephala ), and a Pink-headed or Jambu Fruit Pigeon (Ptilonopus jambu)
have been received in exchange.
The King Penguin hatched in July continues to thrive ; the 1952
bird is now like the other adults except for being paler orange on the
bill, throat, and sides of the head. At the Quarterly General Meeting
in July Head Keeper Jones was presented with the Society's bronze
medal for his skilful work in the rearing of this Penguin. He is the first
Keeper of birds to receive this award.
A second SchlegeFs Dove ; two Lesser Black-backed and a Herring
Gull ; two Quaker Parrakeets ; three Chukor Partridges ; three
Vieillot's Fireback Pheasants ; three Bahama Pintails ; six Carolina
and what is believed to be a Chiloe Wigeon X Carolina have been
bred in the Gardens.
The Snowy Owls hatched one quite strong chick, but it did not
long survive. The Gaboon Forest Robin collected in British Cameroon
during 1948 by Mr. Webb has laid a further two eggs, so it may
be that two is the normal clutch. This bird is fairly common in the
Cameroon forest, but practically nothing is known about its nesting.

H. Murray reports : 44 I have had three Green Cardinals fly to-day
(5th July). They are only about twelve days old and I would have
been happier if they had stayed in the nest for a few more days. This
is the second nest that these birds have had this year. The cock killed
the young of the first nest at three days old and drove the hen to nest

again. When the hen started to lay the cock died of a stroke, and
the hen sat and has reared so far on her own. I realize that the birds
are a long way from being reared but it is interesting all the same."
Murray has also bred the common Grey Waxbill. He writes : " Only
one young bird flew as far as I could see, but it is possible that more
came out last Friday (31st July) in the rain and got lost."

It has been pointed out to me that my account of JVectarinia johnstoni on Mount
Kenya might have given the impression that the few specimens I collected were
caught while there were still young ones in the nests.
I should therefore like to explain that at the time when I caught the birds, the
nesting was, to the best of my belief, at an end in that particular area, and the

GREEN GLOSSY STARLINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96985868" page_id="56291962"  page_num="177" year="" vol="">
I was interested in an article in the March-April Magazine on African Green
Glossy Starlings. As I have kept and bred them since 1932, I can confirm that the
orange-eyed birds and the yellow-eyed birds are the same--as my original pair
both had orange eyes. Of eight that I have reared to maturity, seven have yellow
eyes and only one has orange eyes. I found these birds extremely easy to breed,
and rear up to the time of leaving the nest, and extremely hard to rear to maturity.
Over the years I must have had upward of fifty leave the nest strong and well,
and I have only reared eight to maturity. The story is always the same--about a
week after leaving the nest the young ones refuse all food. The parents frantically
try to feed them, thrusting the food at their beaks, bodies, and even legs. In three
or four days all such young are dead. On one occasion I had five magnificent young
leave the nest, looking extremely strong, and flying and perching strongly ; in
three days they were feeding themselves--on white ants, grasshoppers, and meal-
worms. In a fortnight all were dead. In exactly the same manner as all the others.
I have always thought that this extremely distressing sequence was due to some
food lack. But what it is, I have no idea. My Starlings are fed on a good soft mixture
with fresh grated hard-boiled egg. They have a good supply of insects, especially
when breeding--white ants, mealworms, grasshoppers, crickets, cicades, etc. They
only give the young live food. They have access to fruit of several kinds, but I have
never seen them eat it. Of course they also have access to grit and calcium.
Once I get them through the first moult they are extremely hardy. In fact, I still
have my original cock, and he was mature in 1932.
Another curious fact is that I have never lost a young one in the nest--but always
about a week after leaving.
I would be very grateful if anyone could suggest what is wrong.

PARRAKEET EYE DISEASE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998962880952381" page_id="56291963"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
Mr. Hastings' account of his experience of diseased eyes in newly-imported
insectivorous birds was most interesting. The extraordinary promptitude with
which he effected cures by dosing them with cod liver oil well exemplifies the amazing
effect of giving adequate doses of Vitamins A and D to vertebrates which have
passed through a period of hardship and malnutrition such as I fear newly-imported
birds very often have.
With regard to the application of this principle to " parrakeet eye disease " however,
the case is somewhat different. Doubtless shortage of Vitamin A in newly-imported
stock renders them more susceptible, and I did make this point in a letter to the
Avicultural Magazine published in the September-October issue of 1952. I was
at first particularly inclined to suspect Vitamin A deficiency, as Xerophalmia is
known to occur in poultry in some parts of Australia--probably due to some local
peculiarity in their feeding. I was soon convinced, however, that it is at the most
a secondary factor. In the first place--the first bird I treated, a hen Barraband,
was given very large doses of Vitamin A when she first came under my care, with
some improvement in her general health but none in her eyes. Secondly, all the
others received a Vitamin supplement (containing Vitamins A, B-complex, C, and D)
in the drinking water, which is a routine measure in my bird room for all newly-
imported stock, and all birds kept indoors in winter. Their eyes, nevertheless, only
improved when treated with the antibiotics aureomycin and Chloromycetin, and
relapses occurred if I stopped this treatment too soon.
Xerophalmia can be rapidly cured by large doses of Vitamin A. It cannot be
cured by any other means whatsoever. The birds under my care were not improved
with the Vitamin A they had, but were cured by other means. I think these facts
eliminate Xerophalmia fairly conclusively.
The opportunity of treating more cases is unlikely to arise in future because of
the parrot ban, but I am looking after at present two lovely cock Barrabands, one
English aviary-bred, which contracted the disease in an aviary by contact with a
newly-imported diseased bird. One, the worst case I have ever seen, had a pan-
ophalmitis on arrival ; that is, infection of the globe of the eye itself as well as the
tissues of the orbit. The eyeball actually burst shortly after I received it, and I
expected the bird to die. It did not, however, and seems likely to recover, albeit
with one blind eye. The other bird which had gross disease of both eyes is cured.
As they came from an aviary, I gave neither any Vitamin supplement, but fed
them on seed and green food only.
" Parrakeet eye disease " differs from the ordinary septic conjunctivitis of other
birds in its slow and insidious onset, its long duration, and its extreme resistance
to treatment. The other odd thing is its restriction to a few species of Australasian
Parrakeets. I have only seen or heard of it in Crimson-Wings, Kings, the Polytelines,
Bourkes, and the green Grass Parrakeets. Broadtails appear to be immune, and
I have never heard of it in the Asiatic, African, or South American parrots.

</sectionHeader>

(Turacus hartlaubi)
By Cecil S. Webb (Dublin, Eire)
Hartlaub's Touraco is confined mainly to the Kenya Highlands but
extends into Tanganyika Territory on Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru.
In Kenya its chief haunts are the forested slopes of Mt. Kenya, Mt.
Elgon, and the Aberdare Mts. up to 10,000 feet, and it is also not un-
common in the wooded ravines that extend from these mountains into
the highland plains. It was in one of the latter that the writer first
saw this Touraco in the Aberdare range at an altitude of 8,500 feet.
This was in 1933 at which time Hartlaub's Touraco was unknown to
aviculture.
This bird is so beautifully portrayed in the accompanying plate that
it needs no description but those familiar with the Purple-crested
Touraco (Gallirex porphyriolophus) will notice a marked resemblance if
the white facial markings are excluded.
To capture the atmosphere in which Hartlaub's Touraco lives it is
as well to take a glance at the Kenya Highlands, its inhabitants, and
climate. Here, on the lower slopes of the Aberdares, the equator is
near by ; the days are hot but the nights, owing to the high altitude,
become very cold, frequently showing white frost by the early morning.
The air is dry and invigorating and so the daily extremes in tempera-
ture cause little or no discomfort. However, in the rainy season (June
and July) when the highlands are shrouded in mist for days on end,
it is said to be distinctly gloomy and miserable.
The forested ravines, which descend to a considerable depth below
the level of the surrounding country, were brought into being, as was
the Great Rift Valley, by a shrinkage in the earth's crust. To descend
into one of these from the surrounding grassland is a strange experience,
for one is suddenly plunged into a totally different faunal and floral

zone. When I was first there, from early January to the end of April,
the highland plains were alive with migrants, the most noticeable being
Wheatears and Yellow Wagtails (. Budytes flavns), there being several
distinct races of the latter from widely separated localities but mingled
together here on common ground. Male Jackson's Whydahs ( Drepano -
plectes jacksoni) could be seen bobbing up and down in the grass like
black balls of fluff doing their nuptial dance, and here and there, where
there was a patch of flowering leonotis in an open situation, one might
get a glimpse of the exquisite Kenya Malachite Sunbird ( Nectarinia
famosa ceneigularis ).
On approaching the ravine more leonotis, near cover, was in
evidence and here were seen two gems of the sunbird world--the
Golden-winged ( Drepanorhynchus reichenowi) and the Tacazze Sunbird
(,Nectarinia tacazze) --both looking indescribably beautiful in the
tropical sunlight.
On entering the forest a remarkable drop in temperature was
evident and before proceeding very far magnificent specimens of wild
olive and podocarpus trees, their branches festooned with masses of
long pendant usnea, came into view. A rustle in the branches indicated
a troop of Colobus Monkeys {Colobus polykomos matschiei) feeding quietly
on leaves or berries or even on the usnea with which their long-haired
robes harmonized so perfectly. Occasionally one would see a small
party of White-headed Wood Hoopoes ( Phceniculus bollei jacksoni) busily
probing in crevices in the bark for insects, and more rarely a Narina
Trogon (. Apaloderma narina) flitting silently past to some branch, there
to remain like a statue until the spirit moved it on again.
If one were quiet enough the sprightly and gay-coloured White-
starred Bush Robin ( Pogonocichla stellata) would almost certainly be seen
hopping in the undergrowth. In more open situations were clumps of
Balsam ( Impatiens) with large Shield-bugs piercing their stems for plant
juices.
Frequently when I was enjoying all these things the comparative
calm of the ravine was broken by the loud croaking call-notes of
Hartlaub's Touraco. This challenge was answered by another bird of
the same species some distance away and yet another more distant
until the whole ravine was echoing with their calls. After a minute or
two of this outburst the strange forest atmosphere suddenly would
return to normal.
Touracos, like most fruit-eating birds in the tropics, travel consider-
able distances in search of food, visiting certain fruit-bearing and
berry-bearing trees scattered far and wide. They travel usually in
pairs (though several pairs may be seen feeding together in one large
tree) doing a regular daily round. One tree that I watched was
visited regularly by two pairs of Hartlaub's which used to arrive
on the scene by sunrise, remain about fifteen minutes feeding, and

then disappear for the day, returning to the same tree towards
5 p.m. for a final feed, presumably on the way back to their roosting-
place. I have noticed these regular visiting hours with other Touracos,
but here in the Aberdares they are upset during the olive season. In
February and March food suddenly becomes so plentiful that there
must be tons to the acre, and search for it becomes unnecessary. As
if by magic there is a sudden invasion of Masai Red-headed Parrots
(.Poicephalus gulielmi massaicus), Olive Pigeons (Columba arquatrix ), and
Sharpe's Starlings (Pholia sharpei ) so that the olive trees are alive with
birds all feasting on the oily berries so lavishly supplied by nature.
The Touracos could be seen to regurgitate the stones once the fruit
had been digested. When the olive season was nearing its end the
pigeons, parrots, and starlings disappeared as quickly as they came,
leaving the Colobus Monkeys and the Touracos in peace.
Hartlaub's Touraco, like all the other members of the family, is
perfectly adapted for an arboreal existence, its partly zygodactyl feet
enabling it to run along branches with the greatest of ease. Also it
bounds from branch to branch more like a monkey than a bird. If
temporarily deprived of the power of flight through loss of its primaries
it will not be greatly handicapped if in forest. It will run through the
branches and jump from tree to tree with great agility and will never
panic and fall if chased.
The tail feathers come out remarkably easily (but grow again
rapidly) which is surely a means of protection. It is by no means easy
to catch hold of a Hartlaub's Touraco by the body for it instantly
arches its wings and bounds strongly forward deflecting the hands to
its rear end and so one is left holding merely a bunch of tail-feathers !
This could easily happen to predators.
By setting a flue net with large pockets in a wild olive tree I was
able to capture six Hartlaub's Touracos. These I kept in a small
aviary until two days before my departure, when a native boy left the
aviary door open allowing four to escape. However the remaining two
were introduced to England in May, 1933.
Since the second world war a number have been sent overseas from
Kenya by certain animal catchers, and a pair found its way to the
London Zoo where they have been much admired. The call of the
Hartlaub's Touraco does not differ greatly from that of the other
Touracos of the same genus. Those who have become familiar with
this sound in the wilds of Africa will be carried back there body and
soul on hearing it in some Zoological Gardens.

By The Late Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
It seems to have been the rather general experience that the past
winter which, while not abnormally cold, certainly began abnormally
early, and was very long and unpleasant, has had an adverse effect
on breeding results this summer.
Rheas apparently found the winter so depressing that neither the
three white birds which are now getting very old, nor the three grey
ones which are young adults, succeeded in producing a single egg.
Indeed the grey cock showed much less sign of being in breeding
condition this season than he did last, when he was only two years old.
With waterfowl the season has been a rather poor one, but not
so bad as 1952, which is the worst I ever remember. Ten Red-breasted
Geese were reared and one young Emperor Goose. The latter was
killed by a mysterious enemy which pecked out its eyes, without doing
it any other injury, twenty-four hours after it was released as an almost
fully-fledged bird among peaceful, moulting companions. The
strange thing is that a similar fate overtook a young Magellan gander
at the same stage of development about the same time last year, and
a few years ago some adult Barnacle Geese suffered a similar fate.
The Barnacles, when they were attacked, were far from the water,
but the Emperor and Magellan were on the ponds. There seem to
be no Grows or Magpies about at the present time, nor are there any
predaceous fish which, if they injured one bird nearly adult, would
also have inflicted injury on others which were adult but were not
noticeably larger.
Of Barred-breasted Magellan Geese I now have only a single female
left. She apparently nested away from the Park, and as usual had her
eggs or young destroyed by vermin. In old days, with no more
efficient keepering, it was extremely rare for broods of this family to
come to grief. Now, however, it is quite the exception for any young
to survive, the only Ashy-headed goslings reared being a few that
were caught up and put under hens as soon as their parents had
brought them to the water.
Snow Geese, Lesser Snow Geese, and Lesser White-fronted Geese,
which for some years have not nested in the fox-proof enclosure in
which they had been placed, were turned out in the Park for the
summer as it is rare for foxes to cause trouble except during the
winter months. None of the birds, however, nested, and spent most
of the time wandering about trying to reach an Arctic breeding
ground on foot !
A fair number of Carolina Ducks and Cinnamon Teal have been
hand-reared. It is unfortunate that the latter pretty little bird usually
falls a victim to coccidiosis when kept in the only enclosure which is

reasonably safe from vermin and that the males, when in breeding
condition, appear to be so spiteful towards their own kind. Full-
winged, they do not appear to stay.
Coming now to the members of the Parrot family, neither pair of
Roseate Cockatoos made any serious attempt to nest, and I have
heard of other reliable breeding pairs in other hands behaving this
year in a similar fashion. The Gang-Gang Cockatoos reared one
young male instead of their usual two children.
The old pair of Brown's Parrakeets, which reared a good brood of
five the first year I had them, but lost their young at ten days the two
following years, this season got no further than inspection of nest-
boxes. A short while ago I found the hen Brown's on the floor of the
aviary shelter holding her head on one side, and evidently seriously
injured as a result of some fright she had sustained during the night.
I expected to lose her, but after some days she fortunately recovered.
For a second hen imported last year who proved an extremely
difficult bird to acclimatize, I managed to secure a mate in late
summer. Although she appeared to be very much in breeding condition
at the time, and the pair took to one another at once, she too, got
no further than occasionally examining a nest-box until it was too
late in the year for it to be any use to encourage a breeding venture.
The new cock had been mated to another hen before I received him,
and in order to avoid complications due to the fidelity common in this
species and some other Broadtails, I took precautions before intro-
ducing him to his new mate to induce in the cock's mind the conviction
that his former marriage was a thing of the past with no possibility
of any renewal. After being kept by himself for a few days before he
was sent to me, I kept him also by himself for some days in a cage
in the strange bird-room. After giving him ample time to become
rather bored and lonely, and to forget his former home and associa-
tions, I had him brought out in his cage to the hen's aviary and put
down quietly just outside it. The introduction went off perfectly.
She greeted him with enthusiasm, but also with the modesty which a
cock Broadtail expects of his prospective mate, and when it was
obvious that he too was favourably impressed we turned him out in
the aviary as quietly as possible.
The old breeding pair of Rock Peplars hatched five of their six
eggs and reared a very healthy family--not a bad performance in view
of the fact that the cock nearly died of coccidiosis last autumn and
was extremely ill for a long period.
One of the two young birds I trained to fly at liberty was lost
through a curious and unlucky accident. I had three odd hens
untrained as liberty birds and, having sold one of them, told the
aviary attendant to catch her up. This he did, but failed to notice
that the catching net had a hole in it. She discovered it while being

carried down to the bird-room, and shortly afterwards picked up one
of the two liberty birds and went away with him, neither being heard
of again. It was fortunate that I did not lose both youngsters.
The old pair of blue Indian Ringnecks again did well, rearing
four young ones. This season the cock, always a rather queer-tempered
individual, got bored with his entire family soon after the young had
left the nest, and had to be removed to prevent him doing them an
injury. A young pair of two-year-old blues seemed to be on the point
of nesting when, through the agency of " X " or some mysterious and
unlucky accident, the little inspection door in the side of the nest-box
got open which so upset and alarmed the hen that she lost all interest
in further operations. The third two-year-old young cock, as recorded
elsewhere, produced two green young when mated to a lutino hen.
The young I am rather afraid are both hens so that, while they would
be split for blue, they cannot, unfortunately, carry any factor for albinism.
A pair of Leadbeater's Cockatoos, three years old, were obtained
too late in the season to give them much chance of settling down to
nest, and the pair of imported Citron-crested Cockatoos are so terribly
nervous that it is not surprising that they also did nothing.
The hen of the pair of Princess of Wales Parrakeets began by
behaving in a tiresome way which is too often characteristic of her
sex and species. She occasionally went into the nest-box, but instead
of depositing her eggs there she laid several from the perch until
I put some soft material under the latter to deprive her of the pleasure
of hearing them fall with a plop on the cement floor of the aviary flight
when she decided to place a few in the nest itself, and even sit on them.
When her young were half-grown she made a hearty meal of their
plumage, so that they left the nest with little more than tail and flight
feathers, but in the end they recovered and showed no sign of the
bad treatment they had received. The cock, unlike many cock Princess
of Wales proved a most devoted husband and father, not only feeding
the hen regularly, but also feeding the young when they left the nest
long after their mother had ceased to take any interest in them.
The Barrabands did not seem a very promising pair as the hen,
imported the previous summer, was extremely badly affected with
eye disease, and was only cured with great difficulty by the skill and
patience of Dr. Lake. When the nest-box was put in, for some time
she took only a very casual interest in it. This, however, did not
please the cock as I was made aware, not so much by the evidence of
my eyes, as of my ears. With Barrabands, the cocks are the weaker
sex so unlike Broadtails they cannot beat up their wives when they
feel the latter are neglecting their domestic duties. What they cannot
accomplish by force, however, they can sometimes bring about by
continual nagging. The cock Barraband, when he is annoyed about
anything, shows it, not only by ruffling his feathers and flapping his

wings, but also by making a peculiar peevish, whining noise. In this
form of complaint the cock Barraband began to indulge from morning
till night until it so got on his wife's nerves that she went into the
nest-box and laid six eggs. Five young birds were hatched and
reared, but one or two of them were somewhat rickety, though others
were good specimens.
Manycolours reared two broods, four cocks and a hen in the first
and a cock and two hens in the second. I kept one of the hens as a
mate to a single cock Hooded to find out how near the hybrids would
resemble Paradise, but unfortunately she has just died. The old hen,
also, became ill with coccidiosis, but eventually made a good recovery.
The first sign of illness was that she appeared to experience a slight
difficulty in flying and when she was at her worst, she was not only
unable to fly, but quite unable even to open her wings. The power
of flight was regained quite suddenly after she had been improving
for some time. On the whole, however, coccidiosis has not been quite
so troublesome this year as it usually is, possibly because I have been
giving all susceptible birds a course of " Embazin " at three-weekly
periods during the dangerous period, i.e. July to October. It is said
that no drug will prevent coccidiosis, but that a bird may be cured
if it has already been infected but the microbes have not yet reached
the stage at which they begin to affect the health of their victims.
Two pairs of Elegant Grass Parrakeets, one consisting of an imported
cock and an English-bred hen and the other of two young birds I,
myself, bred last summer, laid three lots of eggs each, but not a single
one proved fertile.
Turquosines did equally badly. The first lot of eggs from my old
pair were all clear, and the second lot had young dead in the shell.
The third lot produced more young dead in the shell and one chick
that died as soon as it was hatched. The fourth lot I gave to a pair
of Elegants, but the hen gave up sitting just before the Turquosine
eggs were due to hatch.
Bourkes did rather better. My old pair reared two young in their
first brood and two in their second. The cock, just as he did last
year, started to bully the hen when the young of the first brood were
still quite small, wanting her to go to nest again, so I removed him and
disposed of him at the end of the season, as this stupid behaviour is
not normal with Bourkes. In fairness to him I ought perhaps to add
that when I returned him to the aviary for the second round he was
perfectly well behaved with his two fully-fledged children, although
he had not seen them since they were quite tiny. The second pair
reared three young in their first round and two in the second, a third
dying in the nest. The young cock in the second round is a par-
ticularly beautiful specimen, large and richly coloured, so that I am
keeping him as a mate for the hen with the unsatisfactory husband.

A second pair of Turquoisines only produced two lots of infertile
eggs. I bred the cock myself last year, and had some difficulty in
mating him. The hen, which I got for him last autumn, who was a
few weeks older than he, started to bully him, so that I had to keep
them separate during the winter. When they were in breeding
condition in the spring, I tried them together again, but the cock had
neither forgiven nor forgotten the treatment he had received and
attacked the hen most savagely. I managed to get him another hen
who at first he found attractive but rather alarming. Before long
they became good friends, but as I have already said, have so far
produced no offspring.
The hen Splendid Grass Parrakeet was alone all winter and came
into breeding condition rather early in the spring. After calling
unavailingly for a mate for some time she apparently gave up all
hopes of matrimony and consoled herself by indulging, not wisely,
but too well, in the pleasures of the table, becoming exceedingly fat.
I greatly feared that there might be trouble if she started laying
when I managed to get her a mate later in the year, and my fears
proved, unfortunately, only too justified, for she died egg-bound with
her sixth egg without ever giving us a chance of seeing that she was ill.
Another pair which I acquired in the spring did better, rearing five
young ones.
With some difficulty I succeeded in obtaining two hen Nyasa
Lovebirds. I have a lutino cock imported from Australia some years
ago. In case the cock proved strictly monogamous and ignored one
of the ladies, causing her to feel frustrated and bad-tempered, I
included in the aviary an odd cock Budgerigar together with a violet
cock and rainbow hen of the same species. Both hen Lovebirds went
to nest, and both ignored the Budgerigar but, although the cock was
friendly with both ladies his friendship with one has been I think,
purely platonic, and none of her eggs has hatched. The other
produced three green young ones which, after the custom of most
Lovebirds, she well and truly plucked in the nest, although they have
now grown their feathers perfectly. It would seem that some lutino
Nyasas, if not all, are not sex-linked as an American aviculturist
has bred quite a lot from a lutino cock and a green hen and all the
young, like mine, have been green indicating that the non-sex-linked
cross is recessive. The pair of Budgerigars reared a large brood--
a yellow-faced violet, a yellow-faced cobalt, two ordinary violets, a
cobalt and a sky-blue, and the Lovebirds did not interfere with them ;
indeed the hen Budgerigar was master.
Fischer's and Masked Lovebirds, let alone, of course, Peachfaces,
are most unsafe companions for Budgerigars, but the small Nyasa
and Black-cheeked are often, I think, reliable.

By E. B. Tanner (Finchley, London, England)
Following upon the recent articles on the above subject by Dr. Lake
and Mr. Hastings, I should like to utter a warning to make sure that
the complaint is not due to a simpler cause, namely dirt and germs
introduced through the eye and leading to death by septicaemia, as
the post-mortems have revealed. The same symptoms apply in every
respect. If taken in time, however, four or five applications of boracic
lotion are sufficient to effect a cure, especially if the patient is kept in
a cage alone, with scrupulously clean perches and with clean paper
(not sand) on the floor. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to remind one
that the bird's beak should be held downwards whilst douching the eye,
thus preventing the lotion from being swallowed. Of course, once the
eye becomes swollen and sealed, as described by Dr. Lake, this treat-
ment is of no avail, and my experience in this case has been death
due to the cause as stated above. Perhaps the remedies he mentions
may avail in these cases. During my many years in charge of the
Bird House at the London Zoo I have found that eye troubles could
usually be traced to this source, being undoubtedly contracted from
dirt and germs deposited on the perch by the bird's feet, etc., being
then picked up when the bird follows its usual habit of rubbing
its face on the perch. I am practically certain that the use of natural
tree branches inside the aviary is one of the chief reasons why birds
pick this up. The rough surface and crevices form ideal lurking-
places for dirt and germs, and it is almost impossible to clean them
properly in spite of every care. In outside aviaries where they are
exposed to rain, they are not so bad, but even there I would prefer
planed perches for a high margin of safety, though I know that it is said
that branches are more natural and, with their varying thick-
nesses, are better for the birds' feet. As to the former, it must be remem-
bered that birds do not congregate on one or two branches con-
tinuously, but have an immense selection. I do not think the latter of
very great importance, but planed perches can be of several diameters
if preferred. Of course, they should not be thick enough to catch
droppings when the birds are upon them. I may say that I cannot
remember a case of this sort amongst the birds kept in the small cages at
the Bird House, where they have planed round perches, and cases
always occurred in aviaries where tree branches were used. Eye disease
used to be common amongst birds sent to dealers by sea when the
perches were in a filthy condition on arrival, either due to neglect, or, in
some cases, wrongly constructed travelling cases which did not permit
of the perches or even the water tins being cleaned. I would
advise that a bird should receive treatment as stated directly an eye

shows signs of weakness. The weakness may, of course, be due to the
bird colliding with some object--this often happens--but the bathing
will be of the same service, and will be a safeguard while the eye is
weak and apt to get infected. But perches that can be properly
cleaned are the best of all--a preventative.
I should like to add that I was induced to submit this suggestion on
remembering a number of small private aviaries and also public
collections where tree branches have been left without cleaning or
renewing for long periods, by their appearance. Infected birds could
be seen at times, their owners or custodians being innocently unaware
that prevention was in their own hands.

The death of Miss Chawner on Friday, 16th October, in her 88th
year, has removed one of the oldest members of the Avicultural
Society, which she joined in July, 1899, and one whom the Society
honoured by making her a life member after she had been a subscriber
for fifty years.
As an aviculturist she was first known for successes in keeping and
breeding owls when she lived at Lyndhurst in the New Forest. For
her as well as for everyone at Leckford it was great luck that she
should have written a charming article in the Magazine about these
owls, because after reading it Mr. Spedan Lewis got in touch with
her through Miss Knobel, and asked her if she would come and take
charge of a big collection of birds he was forming in the Thames valley.
There she had charge of a collection ranging from Macaws to Sun-
birds and including about three hundred owls, a number of which bred.
Later Mr. Lewis disposed of that collection when he moved to
Leckford, but after getting the estate in good order, he built one of the
finest ranges of aviaries and waterfowl enclosures, and started to
form another collection. Here he and Miss Chawner assembled a
magnificent collection of pheasants, owls, touracous, cranes, and
waterfowl, as well as a number of odds and ends.
Miss Chawner was Editor of the Avicultural Magazine from
1935 to 1938, when she was succeeded by the present Editor.
In 1938 Miss Chawner was also beginning to wish to retire from
her other work and, once again through Miss Knobel, Mr. Lewis
appointed a curator, this time me. I came to Leckford to succeed
Miss Chawner in 1939.

I shall always be grateful that I had the luck to come to know
Miss Chawner really well. She was a highly cultivated woman with
a delightful sense of humour, and was also a shrewd judge of people.
She was an entomologist of distinction and discovered and described
the life cycle of two species of sawfly previously unknown in this
country. When Miss Chawner decided to give up serious collecting,
the Keeper of Entomology of the British Museum (Natural History)
came to see her collection, and took a number of specimens to add to
the national collection. Miss Chawner was also a great botanist,
and would go miles to see a rare plant. Like a number of aviculturists,
she was a really knowledgeable gardener, and it is primarily to her
that I owe the great pleasure I get from growing rare plants, and
indeed for a good number of the plants I grow.
I think Miss Chawner's most striking qualities were her serenity
and her lively interest. She always remained what she was, a cultivated
Victorian countrywoman. She was not only a very good all-round
naturalist, she was also a unique friend to all who knew her well.

The tragic death of the twelfth Duke of Bedford, which occurred
on 9th October, has been a severe blow to the Avicultural Society
and its Magazine, to the Zoological Society, and to all who are
interested in the keeping of wild animals, including birds, in captivity
under the best conditions. The collection at Woburn was in the
past the finest in the world, thanks to the skill of the late Duke's
father, and much of it has been fully maintained and even improved
by the Duke whose death we now mourn, for he inherited a love of
animals from both of his parents. His father's interest was, perhaps,
chiefly in the larger mammals, the deer, bison, and so forth, but he
also maintained a fine collection of birds such as waterfowl, pheasants,
and cranes, while flocks of Crested Pigeons might be seen in the trees
or on the lawns. His mother was a very good ornithologist, bird-
watcher, and bird protectionist, one of the very first lady members to
be elected to the British Ornithologists' Union, and for many years
Vice-President of the Avicultural Society.
The only child of these animal-lovers grew up to love the rare
creatures around him, and persuaded his parents to let him keep some
himself. He was chiefly fond of birds, and soon had a good collection
of foreign finches, waxbills, and weavers which he accustomed to fly
loose and make their nests in the gardens around Woburn Abbey.
Among the greatest of the Woburn treasures is the herd of Pere
David's Deer which the eleventh Duke started from a very few
specimens collected from various Continental zoological gardens, the

only remnants of the herd that formerly occupied the Imperial Park
in Pekin. Under the care of his son the herd has increased to more
than three hundred magnificent animals, the only ones in the world
except the few the late Duke gave to Whipsnade, Bronx Park, and a
few other places. A very similar story might be told of the almost
extinct European Bison which has probably been saved from extinction
by the Duke and his father.
The war destroyed much of the Woburn collection, but it was
being built up again by the Duke. Only a few weeks before his death
he told me he was going to try to replace the flock of Australian
Crested Pigeons for which Woburn was formerly famous ; but for
many years past the Duke's favourites among the birds have been
parrakeets, of which he had a collection with few equals in the world.
Many very rare species were represented, as well as rare varieties such
as the famous blue Ringnecks. Members of the Avicultural Society
are familiar with his experiments in evolving a strain of Homing
Budgerigars which has proved quite successful, both at Woburn and
in Devonshire, and as recently as last September he invited me to
spend a night at Woburn so as to be able to see the release of the
Budgerigars in the early morning.
In a large outdoor aviary amongst wooded surroundings were some
hundred or so birds, mostly from early broods this year, and at
7.30 a.m. a door at the top was opened and out flew a crowd of various
colours which had apparently been waiting for this moment. They
flew around in evident enjoyment, some settling upon the high trees,
while others made straight for a bunch of millet sprays, but many
circled around showing off to perfection their arrow-like flight which
can never be seen properly inside an aviary. None of them seemed
to want to go far away from the aviary which they regarded as their
home, and to which they kept on returning through funnel-shaped
openings in the sides. It was a wonderful sight, never to be forgotten.
Under the title of Marquess of Tavistock the Duke (who succeeded
to the full title in 1940), has written many very excellent articles for
the Avicultural Magazine, of which he was for a time Editor, while
his Parrots and Parrot-like Birds has proved of great value to many
aviculturists. He had never lost his early love of wild creatures and
had kept up as far as possible, the wonderful collection established
by his father. He was a thoroughly good man, and besides his great
love of birds and beasts, was very kind to those of his fellow human
beings whom he considered needed his help.

Introduction
Before 1938, when the first known nesting took place at Tring in
Hertfordshire, there were probably less than twenty authentic records of
vagrant Little Ringed Plovers ( Charadrius dubius ) in Britain. Since
then the bird has invaded our country in earnest, finding a habitat
mainly unexploited by other species, and now in 1953 is well established
as a regular summer resident (probably about 100 pairs at a- very
rough estimate) in south England--from Berkshire in the west (with an
outpost in Gloucestershire), to Kent in the east, Sussex in the south,
and Northants and Cambridgeshire in the north--with the main
population centred in the London area. Yorkshire and Stafford also
have some pairs, but in Wales and Scotland the bird is still only an
irregular visitor. I do not propose to deal further with spread and dis-
tribution here, for this has been fully treated by E. R. Parrinder in the
pages of British Birds , Bird Notes , and the London Bird Report , but rather
place emphasis on behaviour, some aspects of which I aim to describe in
fair detail, basing my remarks mainly on personal observations on
several pairs in Berkshire since 1949. As a background for this descrip-
tion I have given a " potted 55 life-history account in the next section.
Now that many observers are Little Ringed Plover conscious, I
doubt that the birds are overlooked to any extent, but prior to the
later war years this was certainly not so. Confusion is possible with
the larger Ringed Plover ( Charadrius hiaticula) and I wonder how many
Little Ringed were formerly written off as the common species. The
two birds are readily distinguished though very alike in plumage. The
best distinction is that while the Ringed has a clear white line on the
upper wing surface the adult Little Ringed has none at all (but
beware, for the juvenile Little Ringed has the very faintest suggestion
of one). Additionally, I find that the orange-yellow eye-rim of the
Little Ringed is a good field-mark which the Ringed lacks ; even
unfledged young have lemon-yellow eye-rims visible at very close
quarters. There is also a marked difference in the adult's bill colour ;
the Ringed has a conspicuous yellowish bill base while for field purposes
the Little Ringed's is more or less entirely dark. A less satisfactory
character of the Little Ringed is the thin white line over the forecrown
behind the black forehead band. The usual call-notes heard (which
are in fact the alarm-notes) at once separate the two species : the
Ringed's is a liquid " too-ee " (with emphasis on the last syllable), the
Little Ringed's a more incisive " pee-00 " (with stress on the first).

Their habitat preference, though there is occasionally slight overlap,
is generally distinct, the Ringed being the sea-shore species, the other
the inland fresh-water one. Of course, both species may occur on the
other's habitat on migration.

It is probably still too soon to attempt an accurate survey of the
main arrival period of Little Ringed Plovers in this country from their
winter quarters abroad. Our records are not sufficient and there seems
to be a great deal of wandering by, presumably, first-year birds which
may turn up at a site for the first time quite late in the season, as may
other individuals which have bred unsuccessfully elsewhere in the
country. However, April is probably the month in which most birds
arrive, but in the last few years March records have increased (earliest
local one, 25th March). Male and female may reach the breeding-
ground at about the same time and, while it is not certain, or even
likely, that they travel together, they do at times form pairs very soon
after arrival. Often, however, the male comes first and is joined by a
female later, nineteen days being my longest record of the interval
between the two arrivals. It is possible that lone females settle for only
a relatively short time, sufficient to rest and feed, at sites unoccupied by
males.
While on the Continent Little Ringed Plovers are mainly river
birds, where they nest on shingle-banks, etc., in England gravel-pits
and the like are the main habitat. Some of these pits are much
frequented by humans, but the birds are very tolerant. What the
plovers need most are not peace and quiet (though very desirable) but
some mud or marshy spot on which to feed, and a stretch of not too
overgrown gravel on which to nest. In this country man would seem
to be the species' main enemy--in the form of gravel-pit workers and
their machinery, over-keen bird-watchers, heavy-footed trampers,
egg-collectors, etc.
On the breeding-ground, soon after arrival&amp;apos; until departure, the male
Little Ringed Plovers, especially, show a variety of aggressive
behaviour-patterns towards other individuals of their own species
(aerial and ground display, call-notes, and, occasionally, fighting),
particularly in the area of the nest-site. They do not, however, confine
themselves to their territory but wander locally, learning to avoid
neighbouring territories, and feed at " neutral " spots which no one
pair owns, though aggressive behaviour may be shown there.
Sexual behaviour may appear soon after the arrival of the birds ;
in fact the very fact that male and female are paired is by itself a sign
that sexual relations have already commenced, at least at low-intensity
for pair-formation is no doubt effected by attempts at the coitional-
ceremony (see below). Copulations and scrape-ceremonies may be

seen almost at once and early arrivals can have eggs by the third week
of April, though May seems to be the month when most eggs are laid.
The clutch of four takes just over three weeks to hatch and the young fly
about three weeks after that. Both parents incubate and tend the young
but sometimes the male plover is left " holding the baby " while the
female at least prepares for a second brood, or, in the case of later
nestings (June-July), actually leaves the breeding-ground. Genuine
second broods (i.e. not repeats after failure) have not commonly been
recorded (Bruce Campbell gives no instances in his recent book
Finding Nests (1953)) ; in fact my own records of local birds in 1952,
when two pairs laid second clutches, seem to be the only British ones.
Some adults leave the breeding-ground as early as July (when others
are still engaged with repeat or second-brood clutches) but August is
the main departure month, birds being less frequently noted in
September. There are as yet no foreign ringing recoveries of British
Little Ringed Plovers (only a comparatively few have been ringed) to
give us even a pointer as to the wintering area of our birds, but this
undoubtedly is the Mediterranean region and northern Africa.
Sexual- and Aggressive-Behaviour
Much recent work on birds and fish by comparative-ethologists has
demonstrated an important fact about the display of animals : when
an individual displays the main drive behind its behaviour at the
moment is in some way stopped from fully expressing itself. To expand,
a male performing its courtship-display is urged on by its sex-drive.
This drive has, as its basic objective, copulation with the female but
display appears instead, perhaps when the sex-drive is low in intensity
or when the female is not fully responsive, but most commonly when it
comes into conflict with one or both of two other drives aroused at the
same time--aggression and escape (" fear "). Both of these are a very
usual response to close contact with fellow members of the species, and
the male just cannot help feeling towards the female in the same way.
Similarly, when a male performs threat-display, this is a sign that the
aggressive-drive, which has attack as its basic aim, is inhibited---
usually by an escape tendency. Thus, while the distinction between
sexual- and aggressive-behaviour in the Little Ringed Plover is clear
enough, it is not absolute. In this species too, there is a strong element
of aggressive feeling in the courtship reactions, and both sexual- and
aggressive-behaviour are mixed with an element of escape. This link
is well demonstrated by the male's " upright " display and associated
activities, which usually precede copulation, the whole sequence of
which it will be convenient to describe next.
The male plover approaches the female in an initial posture very
similar to the horizontal threat-display (see below), his gait a smooth,
gliding run [glide-run). Often she shows pure escape-reaction by

running away and " bobbing ", i.e. standing and jerking the head,
neck, and forebody upwards a number of times, a typical response of
alarmed waders. Sometimes she flies off with the male in chase, but
usually she allows him eventually to catch up with her on the ground
without flying away. The female being relatively still, the male's
display can continue. As he nears her, his footsteps get progressively
shorter, his speed diminishing, until he stands alongside the female
with a deliberate marking-time movement on the spot, sometimes with
such vigour that he strikes his breast with the alternately raised feet,
the body however remaining steady all the while. During this approach
he raises his body from the horizontal to the vertical plane with chest
expanded, black band conspicuous, and head held high (upright
posture ). The female meanwhile has crouched down and the male soon
mounts. Copulation proper does not always follow immediately, the
male squatting down on bent tarsi, perhaps continuing to mark time
on her back for a few seconds, sometimes as long as half a minute.
Coition itself is effected very rapidly as the male flutters off backwards,
his tail bending under the female's which may tilt to facilitate the union
of the cloacas. Once, a nondescript high-pitched note was heard.
Both birds then glide-run away from each other (escape) and com-
mence displacement-feeding (see last section for a note on " displace-
ment-activities "). Occasionally the male may show the same sequence
of display (approach, upright-posture, marking-time) to rivals and
undoubtedly this is the mechanism of pair-formation, as the German
ornithologist Laven found to be the case in the Ringed Plover. If the
approached bird crouches it is accepted as a female and display,
mainly aggressive till then, switches over to a fully sexual response.
If, however, it shows male behaviour, threatens back, etc., the responses
continue on their aggressive course, a fight perhaps resulting. A further
interesting fact supporting the view that the pre-coition display is
partly an aggressive one, is that the whole copulation ritual may
follow a territorial encounter in the Little Ringed. I have noted a very
similar state of affairs in the Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus ),
a species I have been studying since 1948. The courtship-display,
which is however not a pre-coitional one, often follows aggressive tiffs
between rival pairs ; on analysis, the aggressive elements of the display
can be seen clearly. Another link between sex and aggression is
provided by the displacement-feeding that occurs after coition in
Little Ringed Plovers. This is a common component of normal threat
behaviour when escape is the main tendency. Sometimes a newly
formed pair will give alarm-calls when the two birds approach each
other closely.
The scrape-ceremony , a beautiful display pattern connected with the
nest-site, is best dealt with under sexual-behaviour. Though it is not
a pre-coitional display, the male quite obviously has the female in

mind when performing, indeed the presence of a second bird is
essential, and the normal copulation behaviour may follow or precede.
The course of events is initiated by the male who begins to form, or
enlarge, a hollow in the ground ( scraping) by leaning forward and
rotating on his breast, body and tail slanting up, feet scratching
backwards. At the same time he opens his tail feathers, showing the
conspicuous pattern of brown, black, and white, and as he rotates his

movements cause the tail to wave about conspicuously ( tail-flagging ),
this probably functioning to attract the female's attention. She may
then approach the scraping male and, if so, he gets out of the hollow,
stands on the rim with his back to the female and now fans his beautiful
tail right open over the scrape ( tail-spreading ). She slips under and
into the shallow pit and he moves slowly away, tail still spread, at the
same time picking up little pieces of stone and jerking them over his
shoulder towards the nest (. stone-tossing ). As he gets further away his
tail gradually relaxes. The female meanwhile may remain still in the
scrape, rotate in it or move away. The male may then return and
repeat his pattern or follow the female and scrape elsewhere, but
sometimes the activities merely die down or copulation follows. Over
the course of days, several scrapes may be formed, but eventually the
female chooses one and lays her eggs in it. That part of the scrape-
ceremony from the approach by the female onwards, has been termed
the symbolic-nest-relief by Continental writers.
I have already spoken of the horizontal threat-display , a version of which

precedes the upright-posture and marking-time activities of pre-coition.
Both sexes use this against rivals, holding the body horizontally,
normally with the head sunk well into the shoulders, thus mainly
hiding the black bib, and with the feathers of the underparts smoothly
expanded, the flank ones pointing up over the closed wings. (In the
pre-coition version, the under feathers are not so fully emphasized.)
The aggressive bird glide-runs in this squat looking posture towards
the opponent, a sure sign that real attack is not immediately imminent,
for when it is the bird relaxes its display, the black chest-band coming
into prominence, and runs purposefully forward, at high-intensity
raising the back feathers a little and fanning the tail. Fighting may
follow this, launched with the wings, and bill and claw are used if the
birds get to grips, but this comparatively rarely occurs. Only occasion-
ally will the attacked bird stay to argue the point. If it does the two
birds perhaps even then only jump up breast to breast and separate
again to threaten each other. At times, during more intense threat-
display, the head may be less tightly sunk into the body and then the
black bib shows up well. At lower intensities, the bird may stand or
walk slowly about, with little or no orientation towards the rival, with
the head held back, but not deeply sunk into the body, to meet the
back feathers which are smoothly mounded up to a moderate extent
( hunched-posture ). The white under-feathers too are only slightly

expanded, the flank ones not pointing up over the wings, and the&amp;apos;bib
is not hidden. The tail may be spread and lowered, and at times the
plover may stand up a little from the horizontal. In all display the
orange eye-rim shows up conspicuously. A special threat-note (termed
the hostility-cry by the Dutch ornithologist Sluiters) occurs during
aggressive encounters (but not prior to copulation). This is a fast,
mechanically ringing and rather musical " gree-gree-gree ..." which
becomes more slurred and higher pitched as it increases in speed.
Less commonly, a series of low rolling rattles may be heard. At very
low intensity the birds cease to display and displacement-feed or
preen ; here we seem to have to do with a weak escape-drive.
Apart from ground threat, the male also has a flight-threat-display used

against flying intruders or from the air to birds on the ground. On
seeing a trespasser in such circumstances (and at times the male
plover is very unselective, reacting to his own mate and a variety of
innocent birds of several species), the attacker moves towards it, in
fast flight if the other is airborne, giving the hostility-cry. This may
develop into display on close approach, the male stalling with rapidly
quivering primaries raised in a medium V and describing a narrow
arc. The tail is often fanned and, if the intruder is on the ground,
perhaps elevated while the feet are slightly lowered. At the same time
as the bird goes into display, the call changes to a very fast buzzing-note.
This may sometimes be given in flight without the display. No real
attack occurs in the air, but any of the ground activities may follow
when the bird alights.
Butterfly-display-flight is another aggressive pattern. It commonly
follows ground encounters with rivals, often when these have left the
point of conflict, but sometimes occurring when no rival is involved
at all, as for example when the male returns to the territory from
outside. In this display the plover flies round the territory, curving
backwards and forwards with the wings slowly beating, well extended,
causing an illusion of a short tailed bird, and describing a com-
paratively small arc. Sometimes the bird tilts more from side to side
with the wings flicking rather quicker, emphasizing the pale under-
surface. A monotonous rusty-call , the " song 5 5 of the plover, accom-
panies this slow-motion flight, a deliberate " cree-ah(k)-cree-ah(k)-
cree-ah(k) . . Some authors have called this display-flight a nuptial
one but this interpretation is extremely doubtful. I have never seen it
obviously given to the female and even if it is on occasions, we probably
have to do with a case of the female releasing aggressive-behaviour in
her mate.
On 22nd May, 1953, I saw an apparently unusual and interesting
encounter between two males (A and C) at a feeding spot used by A
for well over a month, but which now was presumably claimed by G
as territory for a short while. When I began watching at 06.50, male A
was scraping at moderate intensity and tail-flagging for a short while,
more often merely standing and stone-tossing. His mate was incubating
well-sat eggs about 300 yards away over the water. Male G was
standing, facing away from A, a half-dozen or so yards from him, in
the hunched-posture. At the same time he dipped his head and bill
down towards and ground and back again several times, with the rest
of the body quite still. Later observation showed that this was incipient
stone-tossing. This male then glide-ran in the hunched-posture,
finally turning towards A, tail fanned and lowered, and uttering a long
series of hostility-cries. Both males then moved about in the hunched-
posture, neither really facing the other, giving intermittent hostility-
cries while A (apparently) also uttered several alarm-notes (" pee-00 ").

Both also performed the head dipping movement which developed into
stone-tossing and scraping, and displacement-fed occasionally on
reaching softer mud. Finally, G flew up in low-level flight-threat-
display at A and then circled about in butterfly-display-flight with
hostility-cries from time to time, sometimes when flying just above A.
Observations ended soon after at 07.30. I do not pretend to understand
this encounter but it suggests a further link between sexual- and
aggressive-behaviour.

Copulation and scrape-making being achieved successfully, the
breeding-cycle continues. No material is brought to the nest-scrape
by the plovers which reach out from it and pick up items such as flakes
of mud, dry bents, and the stones that tend to collect about because oi
the stone-tossing activity. These are added to the cup, which some-
times becomes quite substantial. It is interesting to note that the very
large nest of the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) accumulates in a similar way,
by the raking-in of material by the sitting bird. Stone-tossing in the
Little Ringed Plover is not confined to the scrape-ceremony, but may
occur during incubation, when the clutch is incomplete and also when
the parents change over at the nest.
Eggs are laid on alternate days and four make up the usual clutch,
though later ones may be of three only. Incubation of sorts may start
with the first egg but it probably becomes most sustained some time
between the laying of the third and fourth. Both sexes incubate and
the eggs hatch out in just over three weeks.
The first signs of hatching may show several days before the tiny
chicks escape from the shell. The eggs first fracture at the point in the
large end where the chick's bill, equipped with a whitish " egg-tooth "
on the end of the upper mandible, taps at the shell from within. Such
cracking may appear as many as five days before hatching though
sometimes the fracture is still not obvious only a day or so before the
emergence. At about the same time as fracturing, the youngster may
be heard faintly calling " chip " or " cheep " if the egg is held up to
the observer's ear. Doubtlessly the brooding parents can also hear
this. As the tapping inside the egg continues, the shell is pushed
outwards until a hole appears and the bill of the chick is visible.
Finally the shell splits open into two main parts and the chick has
hatched. The broken pieces are carried away from the nest and, so
strong is the urge to do this, that I have seen a parent, calling its
young after disturbance, chance upon a fragment of shell from the
hatching one or two days previous and carry it away immediately to
the water's edge. The chicks often hatch within a few hours of one
another, apparently usually overnight. Sometimes one may be as
much as twenty-four hours behind the others, but a more or less

synchronous hatching would seem to be desirable. The young soon
leave the scrape, especially if disturbed, and a late egg may be left
behind unbrooded. At one nest an egg had only a small hole in the shell
some twelve hours after the others had hatched. The three chicks had
left the nest so I acted as midwife by enlarging the hole with my thumb
nail. Even so I was worried lest no adult returned to the nest, but in the
evening one of the parents was seen to go to the scrape, call the chicks
to it, and brood them and the egg together. The latter had hatched
out by next morning and all four youngsters successfully reached the
free-flying stage.
The chicks are damp on coming out of the egg and need brooding,

of the chicks, like they do on eggs, but rather half stand, with fluffed
underparts, and allow them to creep in underneath. Generally one
parent is on duty at a time while the other waits " on guard 55 near by
or goes off to feed. The young are not fed, though one popular writer
has stated that they are. They find their own nourishment in the form
of minute invertebrates (mainly insects) on the gravel or at the water's
edge. The stomach of one very small chick, not much more than
twenty-four hours old, contained the remains of many tiny beetles.
Apart from brooding, the parents' other important task is to warn the
chicks of danger and to deal with the would-be predator. The only pre-
dator of which I have had experience is man in the form of the observer
--myself. On being approached by a human the bird utter the alarm-
notes (" pee-00 " and " cloo "). When very young the chicks probably

always immediately crouch flat down at this and remain perfectly still,
but larger young are usually only put on guard on hearing the calls.
They show alarm by " bobbing " and displacement-feeding, only
crouching when they see the predator or when the parents fly up from
them, calling. Once down the chicks remain there until the observer
has gone and the parent has reappeared. Small chicks advertise their
position to the adult with a rather high-pitched piping. Larger young
are called up to the parent by a fast repeated " pip-pip-pip-pip ..."

call. The best way of locating the chicks when unobserved approach
is impossible is to allow the parent to locate them for you. First flush
the adult, then retire to cover, or as far away as possible in the open,
and stay still. Almost invariably the parent will soon resettle and,
after initial alarm, go to or call up the chicks. Even if these are old and
require no brooding, the return of the adult will stimulate them to
move about again, but the older the chicks are, I find, the harder they
are to track down. The younger the chick, the stronger the parental
brooding-drive and the swifter the return to them. I once had the
wonderful experience of seeing a female come and brood her single
tiny chick only five feet from me as I lay perfectly still flat out on the
gravel. The call of the young on being persistently handled is a trilling
purr of a note. The chicks swim readily if needs be, even when not
disturbed.
Apart from the behaviour outlined above, the adults may exhibit
a very complex and elaborate set of reactions towards man, the potential
predator. My studies have mainly dealt with this form of behaviour
and it is worth outlining the whole gamut of reactions to man through-
out the annual cycle in order to put those occurring during the chick-
stage in their proper perspective. It is impossible, however, to give all

K. E. L. SIMMONS-THE LITTLE RINGED PLOVER
the intricate details and complex discussion of facts in the present
paper.
In the winter and early days after arrival at the breeding-ground the
main response to the close approach of man is escape. This takes the
form of " pee-oo " alarm-notes, bobbing, displacement-feeding, and
flight away. When the plovers have settled down in the breeding-
territory, but before eggs have been laid, they still show alarm but
seldom fly away unless really very closely approached. Instead they
run ahead of the observer, tending to adopt a crouching position with
legs bent, head in, and body more or less horizontal ( crouch-run ). This
is often followed up by displacement-feeding. If the birds do fly they
seldom go far. Some factor is inhibiting the full expression of the
escape-drive, and we think that this is a tendency to attack, though the

birds dare not do this to such an immense upright predator as man.
Occasionally, however, the male will break into the territorial butterfly-
display-flight and even utter the buzzing-note towards the intruder--
a sure sign that he is feeling aggressive to him. Just before egg-laying
another pattern appears. At the end of a crouch-run away the bird
may stop and, instead of displacement-feeding and/or calling, it may
lean forward and crouch down on the ground, sometimes in a hollow,
and remain still there as if brooding eggs, perhaps for over a minute
at a stretch if the observer does not approach. It may perform this
displacement-brooding several times in succession. All the behaviour listed
so far continues to be shown during incubation, but then the birds tend
to do the brooding movement incompletely, crouching with the body
slanting forward sharply, stern in the air, vent showing, and the legs
only half bent (. squatting ). They tend now to run in a similar posture on
occasions, in short dashes ( high-tailed run) and the more incubated the

eggs become the more inclined are the birds to perform the most
complex of the reactions to man-- distraction-display. Until the hatching
time, however, the plovers do not draw attention to themselves in the
area of the protectively coloured eggs. They fly silently away with
perhaps the first signs of peculiar flicking wing action ( impeded-Jlight)
and show the more elaborate behaviour at some distance. Apart from

the usual alarm-note, " pee-00 ", another call with a hard edge to it is
common now, a fast repeated " cloo ". Near hatching time onwards,
and especially during the first few days of the chicks' lives, the parents
are liable to perform intense distraction-display if sufficiently stimu-
lated. Impeded-flight becomes very pronounced as the birds flit round
the observer and calling increases a great deal. As the chicks get
older the elements of reaction drop out one by one in the order in
which they appear, until when they are free-flying the adults are
showing the same reactions as in the pre-egg period.
Distraction-display is very intricate, varying much in intensity
depending on the age of the chicks and the degree of stimulation. High
intensity display is to be expected when the young are small, lower
intensity prior to hatching and when the chicks are older. However,
once when I was ringing two-week old young, one gave its purring
alarm-note and immediately one of the parents flew at my head,
swerved off, and broke into violent and totally unexpected display.
In the following description the full intensity sequence is outlined ;
at any one moment, of course, the behaviour may be at any stage in
this sequence and elements may be omitted. One so often reads that
simply such-and-such a wader runs off fluffing its feathers and trailing
a wing, that I may be forgiven for going into detail in order to show
how much more is usually involved.
Crouch-running is the first ground reaction, probably after the plover
has circled round in impeded-flight. This is succeeded by high-tailed
running, the bird pausing and then dashing off again. Soon, at the
end of a run, it may sidle to one side, sway its body round a little to
get a better view of the observer, and then squat, the wings being now

free of the flank feathers. The first element of true distraction-display
( wing-hinging ) may now appear. With ducked head, the plover starts
to move the closed wing outwards, at first with perhaps only a few
slight tremblings. Soon the wings are trembled jerkily with a rotating
action, the primary-tips moving out well from the sides. The bird
often tilts over, now to one side, now to the other, hinging the opposite
wing. The observer is soon conscious that much more white is visible

on the upperparts than is normally the case, especially in the rump area.
This is because the flank feathers are fluffed right up over the sides
and on to the back so that only a narrow band of brown shows down
the centre. The bird's conspicuousness is further stressed by the pale
under-tail and belly feathers. On increasing intensity the wing move-
ment speeds up into a rapid fluttering, still with the side-to-side tilting,
and the tail may be fanned into its striking pattern and depressed to
the ground. The position of the wing feathers is interesting all the
while. The secondaries remain folded over the primaries as when
normally closed at the side and the wing literally hinges outwards and
forwards with the carpal fixed still at the side of the bird's breast. The
pale undersurface of the wing is thus exhibited to the observer, who
always views the displaying plover from behind. Wing-hinging
develops into wing-rotating. The folded wing is now held out from the
side, the carpal being no longer fixed, the bird raises its body more
erect and rotates the wing rather like a schoolchild doing its elbow-
circling exercise. The tail is usually fanned and lowered. From this
the bird may switch to high-wing raising. The primaries of one wing
suddenly flick out from under their secondaries, both retaining the
same relative levels as when folded so that the wing is now curved.
The wing is held straight up and is usually tilted forward slightly,
showing the undersurface. The bird may rest thus, leaning on the side
away from the raised wing, or occasionally flick up the other wing as
well, lying with them both up and tilted forward. At still higher

intensity open-wing flapping occurs. With both wings partially or wholly
open, the bird vigorously beats now one several times, now the other,
against the ground, turning the body frequently as it does so. Some-
times the wings are merely flicked up and down one at a time,

occasionally both together. Although the plover usually high-tail runs
between bouts of static display, it may now and then run on while still
displaying and occasionally fly low over the ground or water with tail
still fanned and depressed and with very ungainly wing movements,
probably a compromise between display and impeded-flight. Even
more occasionally it may perform a display-run with the wings twitching
up and down alternately at the sides. I once saw a beautiful version
of this when a bird ran off twitching the wings under the fully expanded
and lowered tail. Displaying birds are often silent. The two alarm-
notes may be given during pauses or when the bird is merely squatting,
but a pecular cliattering-call accompanies very high intensity display at
times. While performing the bird tends to make partial use of cover,
displaying in hollows, behind mounds, etc. The more worked up it
becomes the nearer it displays to the observer. Really close display
is not common, however, under usual conditions. The best way of

effecting a near approach is for the watcher to lie down. Probably
when he destroys his outline and height he ceases to be a human as
far as the plover is concerned, and the bird becomes less afraid. Often
it stops displaying and then attempts to reach the chicks and brood
them.
Miscellaneous
In the broad details of its behaviour the Little Ringed Plover is very
similar to its near relations, the Ringed and Kentish Plovers. The
aggressive-behaviour of all three is much the same ; though the threat-
displays and notes differ in form, they all have more or less the same
butterfly-display-flight. The Little Ringed, however, alone has a well-
developed flight-threat-display though there are signs of this activity
in the Ringed Plover at least. Sexual-behaviour is more or less identical
in Little Ringed and Ringed but very little seems to be known about
the Kentish. General breeding-behaviour is closely similar in the three,
except that the Kentish regularly lays only three eggs and these are
often nearly covered over by the nest-scrape material. The distraction-
displays follow the same general trends, though there is much variation
in detail, but the Ringed and Kentish have commonly used display-
runs. So close is the behaviour of these ringed-type plovers that they
seem regularly to try to keep one another off their breeding-territories.
Avicultural evidence of interbreeding, which does not occur in the
wild, would be very interesting. I wonder if any aviculturist would
kindly advise me as to the possibility of keeping any of the three
plovers in captivity from an early age onwards. An opportunity of
such close study would be invaluable.
Male and female Little Ringed are practically impossible to dis-
tinguish in the field except at close quarters with the aid of binoculars.
Then it may be seen that some females are definitely browner than
their mates about the head markings, especially the patch through the
eye, and have the orange eye-rim less bright. I find the sexes of the
Ringed Plover easier to tell apart, again mainly on the intensity of the
black markings, while in the Kentish there is a well-marked sexual
dimorphism.
The Little Ringed Plover is a ground feeder, obtaining most of its
food near or at the water's edge, on gravel, short grass, mud, etc. Its
gait while hunting is a twinkling run, the bird stopping and dipping
its body forward to seize prey. It shares with the Lapwing (Vanellus
vanellus ) and the gulls ( Lams ), among others, one curious habit
apparently connected with food-seeking--that of making pattering
movements of the feet on mud. In the two plovers this is a trembling
action of one foot only while the gulls mark time with both feet. The
habit probably functions to bring prey to the surface of the damp mud.

Mention has often been made elsewhere in this paper of displace-
ment-activities, a concept which owes much for clear definition to
Tinbergen and his school. In general terms, a displacement-activity
may be described as a movement occurring when the internal drive
in action at the moment is not the one which normally produces that
movement. Thus, in the Little Ringed Plover it was seen that dis-
placement-feeding occurs during encounters between rivals, after
coition and in response to predators. Here we most probably have to
do with a blocked escape-drive in some way and it is worth noting that
on occasions the bird utters the alarm-note while doing the feeding
movements. These movements are usually performed incompletely,
the plover not really seizing and eating prey, but sometimes the full
pattern is enacted, especially in response to predators at a stage in the
breeding-cycle when distraction-display does not normally follow on
increased stimulation.
Finally, a word to would-be Little Ringed Plover watchers. A great
deal of work remains to be done on the behaviour and general biology
(and I hope the present paper doesn't show too much how true that
statement is !). For instance, we still need to know much more about
pair-formation and the only descriptive side of aggressive- and sexual-
behaviour has been touched upon in any detail, full analytic study
being needed. The breeding-biology requires to be worked out in
detail and measured. Among other questions are the following. Do
the parents ever call the young to food sources, as do many gallinaceous
birds which the plovers approach in so many of their behaviour
patterns ? What are the natural predators ? Does the male Little
Ringed bear the brunt of the incubation duty when the eggs are fresh,
as the male Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus ) seems certainly
to do ? The queries are numerous and the intending watcher is
guaranteed a busy and interesting time whatever his bent.

world, and are native to the Riu Kiu Island chain south of Japan.
The species varying in coloration with their Island home. The species
here mentioned is from Amami Oshima in the north of the group.
In my forty-odd years of collecting soft-billed birds, I have seldom
long been without a male " Loochoo " Robin. The females are
extremely difficult to obtain, the reason being that a male call bird
is used in trapping, and females generally stay away. The males are
very aggressive fighters. Of the only two females I have had, one was
received in 1949, the other in early 1952.
The 1949 bird had two eggs, and sat for ten days, when a bowel
upset killed her. This story relates this year's success. When the
1952 bird arrived, I had two fine males, one I had had for more than
twelve years, the other about two years, and to this one my hen was
mated this year. Since the female was not in fit condition upon
arrival, I was compelled to keep her separate until April, 1953.
The female was in a large cage inside the 50 feet by 25 feet aviary
where the male could see her for these many months. Early in March
the male built a nest in an old natural log nest-box, but the female was
not released until April. When released the male did not at once
display, but he did sing to her and kept going in and out of his log,
which is 18 inches from the ground, trying to interest her, but she
would have none of it. There was another log nest hung about 8 feet
up on a dead tree trunk, and to this one the female took a great interest,
and in three days she had put quite a few dry bamboo and old moist
leaves into it. The male was seen to look in once in a while, but he did
not assist in building. The hen filled the log nest to within about
3 inches from the hole, and then formed the nest with dry grasses and
horsehair. Now the male was seen to display and sing to his mate,
and a pretty sight it is. He struts, not unlike a Turkey, with lowered
wings, tail fanned out and held up over his back the while a torrent
of lovely song pouring forth. The actual mating is a violent affair,
so much so that I thought he would kill her with his fierce onslaughts.
The next day one egg was seen in the nest, and another the next, then
a third and sitting in earnest began. This log nest had a very large
hole which worried me, as any bird or mouse could get in, but all
went well for fourteen days, the male was a perfect guardian, and
chased every other bird that came within ten feet of the nest, small
or large ; Grey Thrush, Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrushes, Indian

The hen prepared small mealworms, flew to the nest with them in
her beak, and then ate them, which indicated something was wrong.
Upon looking in the nest I found it to be empty ! I blamed a number
of things, other birds, mice (of which there were a few), but no doubt
it was the male wanting to mate again, etc. I then caught the female
and caged her for a week, thinking the rest would do her some good ;
the male all the while went in and out of " his " nest. After again
releasing the female, the male tried and tried again to interest her
in his nest, but she chose a small square parrakeet nest-box which I had
nailed some nine feet up on the concrete block wall of the shelter to the
aviary. This nest-box has a platform under the 1^ in. diameter
hole which she usually used before entering. She almost invariably
approached the nest from the same direction. This box had been
used as a sleeping place for an Indian Nuthatch, which was promptly
killed by the male Loochoo before I could stop it. The female Loochoo
again built the nest, and laid her three pale buff-coloured eggs after
the usual pretty courtship. The male did not assist in incubation, but
made quite a nuisance of himself fighting with all other aviary inmates.
When the female had sat for a week, I caged the male so that he could
see the nest and sing to her.
On the fourteenth day one young hatched, and on the fifteenth day
there were three young in the nest. We were very lucky in having a
good supply of very small mealworms, and many in the soft grub stage,
also I had an old beehive with thousands of wax moth larva, to which
the female was partial. All went well until the fifth day (my wife
would feed her at regular intervals six or seven times a day, or approxi-
mately every hour when I was not home). We gave the hen two or
three worms or grubs and larva at a time, which " dose " she two
to four times took to the nest. Each time, for approximately the first
week, she waited to swallow the faeces of the young, after which
she carried the fecal sacas the length of the aviary, dropping them
into the water. On her third trip to the nest I could hear her jumping
up and down in the nest, and then she let out a Loochoo Robin shriek,
and emerged with a dead young in her beak. She flew the fifty feet
length of the aviary with the young one and I after her, she dropping
it in the water. My spirits sank after this, as I pictured the other two
young with the same fate, but luck was with me. On the seventh day
all was going along beautifully, when I discovered a place not far from
our house that had thousands of earwigs in old benches and tables,
which were easily collected by holding a large bowl under the earwigs'
hiding spots and pounding the spots with a hammer, upon which the
insects literally poured out. I rushed home with my find, and needless
to say " Mamma " Loochoo recognized the earwigs at once. I gave
her only two at a time at first, after I had snipped off their pincers
with a fingernail clipper. The next day I increased the number, but

always alternating with small mealworms, grubs, and wax moth
larvae ; once in a while I had a 44 flying daddylonglegs " and a moth
or two for her.
On the twelfth day my wife and I began discussing whether we
should take the young or not. I held off until the fifteenth day, which
was a bit late, as the young were ready to fly, and fly they tried when
I did take them. It was almost a full day before they would take
food from me, and one of them I did have to force a bit, but the next
day all was well, and they begged for food readily. At this stage the
tails hardly showed, and it was at least two weeks before they had
tails long enough to wag up and down in true Loochoo style. The
young were rusty brown and heavily speckled with lighter brown or
fawn. I was surprised to hear them tuning up quietly when two weeks
out of the nest. Now at approximately ten weeks, white and black
feathers are showing, and some of the reddish ones too. The face and
underparts up to now were greyish. As I write (8th August) the white
underparts are quite noticeable, and the black feathers too, also the
rich reddish-brown of the male is beginning to develop, but not the
black face as yet. I hoped that both would be females, but no such
luck. I feel certain the dead chick would have been a female. I am
most contented with this success, even though on ist August the female
and mother of these two succumbed to a bowel upset. I tried Aureo-
mycin and Enos Fruit Salts, but to no avail. Tragedies like this are
difficult to understand, especially when the aviary is ideal for Robin-
type birds, having much leafmould, lawn, bushes, rocks, moss, running
water, bamboo forest, logs, etc., etc., and the male was caged. The
female did not appear to be aged either. Oh, the patience of an
aviculturist !
I will not, however, wait another thirty-five years for another
female, but will go myself if friends in Japan can't get me one. If I
were down to my last bird I would want it to be a Loochoo Robin.
By i st September the two young males were in full colour and in
fine condition and singing quietly all day long.

" . . . the Ministry will be prepared to issue a licence for the im-
portation of five parrakeets from Holland on receipt of an under-
taking that your poultry have been removed from the premises and
that none will be kept in future. The undertaking must also state
that none of your collection of birds will be sold, either the progeny
of the imported birds or any surplus stock from the collection, and
that no birds will be given away or disposed of in any way other
than by destruction."
The quote is from the reply of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries to an application made last May for a licence to import five
Brown's Parrakeets from Holland, where they had been for some two
months and had been described to me as " perfect nice and healthy ;
5 pieces being 2 cocks and three hens " !
After some " negotiation " (if such is the right word to use in regard
to a Ministry Department) the restrictions were, in the particular
circumstances of this case, modified to allow the import of the birds on
my undertaking to remove all poultry from my premises and not to
keep any in future, to isolate any birds imported from the rest of the
collection for two months, not to sell, give away, or otherwise dispose
of them, and not to sell, give away, or dispose of any of their progeny
during the following two years. Negotiations had, however, lasted so
long that my Dutchman became impatient and disposed of some of
the five so eventually I only got a pair. In the meantime, however, a
fine cock Brown's had been obtained from Sir Crawford McCullagh as
a mate for another hen imported last year.
When, a couple of months later, I applied for, and obtained, a
licence for a cock Crimson-wing, also from Holland, though the restric-
tion as to poultry was rigidly adhered to the other provisions were
slightly modified so as to provide that " the birds will not be sold,
given away, or disposed of in any way other than by destruction or
re-export ", Allowing the restrictions to be necessary, and it rather
looks as though they have now come to stay, they must surely result
in the loss of all the rarer species of parrakeets through natural wastage
and in-breeding. But why pick on the parrots ; what of the finches,
weavers, and others still arriving ?

was also unique in that every adult mated hen nested and with one
exception reared their young and there were some remarkable egg

Pennant's inveterate eaters of eggs which is a very good reason why
I think, so few are reared each year. I have at last devised a nest
which excludes all but the most venturesome cock with the result that
the two girls and I between us reared eight young.
Secondly Kings. The loss of the breeding hen last autumn after but
one successful season was a big disappointment. A second hen that for
the past four or five years had, with cocks that had failed to fertilize
her eggs, laid and incubated clutches of six or seven eggs was mated to
the widower. Instinct must this year have warned her what was about
to happen for she laid but three eggs all of which hatched and were
very well reared. Of all the parrakeets I keep, or have kept, Kings are
the favourite and what a joy it is to feed a breeding pair with young.
So soon as these chicks attained any size a pound of seed, half an
apple, and vast quantities of groundsel were eaten each day. The two
birds bred last year have turned out to be both cocks.
And, finally, a word about the Splendids. The season has con-
clusively proved that they are no more liable to sudden death than
any other parrakeet and are reasonably easy to breed. I have yet to
lose a bird from a broken skull or neck ; some broods are steady from
the first, others wild, though not excessively so, and these latter almost
invariably knock the feathers from the crown of the head and fracture
the skin immediately they come out of the nest, but for that matter so
do a good many other young parrakeets that are bred here. The type
of aviary you use and its seclusion or otherwise undoubtedly has a lot to do with
these " mysterious " deaths one hears so much about.
With the original hen, this season four of her 1951 hens were used for
the first time. The five produced in the first " round " forty-six eggs.
There were inevitable breakages amongst the eggs and loss of newly
hatched youngsters by the inexperienced hens (it was one of these
hens that was the breeding failure, she losing one by one her five young)
but the joint effort of the others resulted in twenty-two very good young
being reared. Second nests were almost a complete failure, for which the
weather was entirely to blame, and only one further young bird was
reared from four clutches. Two hens apparently thought they might
miss the boat if they sat, so decided to play safe by abandoning their
eleven eggs and falling into moult instead ; they were probably right,
as one of their sisters did lose her small brood when the weather
turned quite cold late in September.

By I. Baty (Ponteland, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Northumberland,
England)
Something over a year ago I sent in an account of my Elegants which,
judging by correspondence I have received, seems to have been read
by quite a number of members, so I am continuing the story in the
hope that it will be of interest.
To recapitulate, I started with one pair in the autumn of 1946
received from Dr. Alan Lendon. Breeding results were :--
1947. --Nil.
1948. --Three.
1949. --Three plus three from the young hen of 1948 paired to
one or other of her brothers. Total six.
1950. --Three pairs of breeders--three each from the two older
pairs. Total six.
1951. --Still three pairs--Pair No. 1, three young ; pair No. 2,
six young ; pair No. 3, nine young. Total eighteen.
1952. --As for 1951, except that pair No. 2 had seven young
making the total nineteen.
And so to 1953 when the story is not so " elegant ", though it is
none the less interesting. We had a wonderful spring in the north,
which encouraged the birds to breed earlier than usual. Pair No. 1--
the original Australians--laid their first egg on 1st April, as did
pair No. 3, my most prolific pair. Pair No. 2's first egg appeared on
7th April--and the dates are significant because of what happened
later.
Pair No. 3's four eggs were all the eggs I was able to see while the
hens were brooding, because the other two hens always rushed back to
their logs whenever I entered their flights in the hope of getting a peep
at the eggs.
I did not record the date when I found that pair No. 3 had hatched
their four young, but they were not more than a day or two old.
Within another day or two I managed to look into the No. 2 nest and
found only one young one alive, another dead, and a clear egg.
Prepared to take a risk, I took out the young one, put a 1953 Budgie
ring on it, and put it into the No. 3 nest along with their four. I cleaned
out the No. 2 nest in the hope that they would go to nest again--which
they actually did.
Then I began to reckon up dates and decided that it was long past
time for pair No. 1. to have hatched. That evening I managed to get
a look into the No. 1 log and found five eggs. This was new from the
old Australians, which in the previous five years had never varied
from having three eggs. But the lapse of time made me certain that

they were not going to hatch. I took out an egg, broke it, and, as I
expected, there was a fully developed chick " dead in shell I reached
down, took out the remaining four eggs, and threw them in the dustbin.
Imagine my consternation when I saw that three of the broken eggs
contained live chicks, but the damage was done. Just too bad.
But worse was to follow. The next day I found hen No. 3 lying dead
in the flight. I blamed cats, which are my real bete noir. On looking
into the log I saw that all five young were alive, but would they survive
long ? They were little better than tiny pieces of meat covered with
down. To cut a long story short the cock has reared all five, and they
are as fine as any I have seen.
Pair No. 2 were slow in getting on with their second nest, but when
I went abroad at the end of July they had three fully-feathered young
almost ready to leave the nest. On my return towards the end of
August there were two fine young ones flying about, the third having
died after leaving the nest. Perhaps cats again. On looking into the
log I found the remains of a fourth young one which had died at an
early age.
I was not sure that the old pair No. 1 would attempt a second nest,
but they did, returning to their normal practice of three eggs. This
was new for them, because they had always been single brooded.
Again something went wrong. I found two of the eggs broken and the
third very dirty and " neglected " looking, so again I cleaned out the
nest. This must surely be the end--but it wasn't. Just before I went
away the old hen laid again !--a third attempt.
On my return I found this old hen a dreadful mess. She was plucking
herself. But she had three well-developed young ! Now comes a curious
part of the story. This hen had always plucked her young--sometimes
rather badly--so that they looked wretched when they left the nest
though they all fully recovered from the disfigurement. This time
when she has plucked herself she has scarcely touched the three young
which are now flying like hawks, and are actually the wildest I have
ever bred. That is a puzzle I have not solved--they are in the same
aviary, have the same nesting log, and the feeding is the same as it has
been since I got them seven years ago. But I prefer the hen to pluck
herself rather than the young--if there has to be plucking.
So in spite of tragedies 1953 has provided ten young Elegants, which
means that sixty-two have been bred here since 1948, which is not
a bad record. And what are they like ? I may be forgiven if I give
you the opinion of a real expert.
A week or two ago I had a surprise visit from Dr. Alan Lendon--
and I wish I had the space to enlarge upon the pleasure that visit
afforded me. I was able to show him the original pair he sent me in
1946 with their three young, and all the others except one which had
been sold, and he was kind enough to say that these birds are as fine

as any he has seen, even in the wild. I regard that as praise indeed,
coming from one whose knowledge of Australian parrakeets must be
second to none.
Dr. Lendon was not sure whether the birds he sent me were wild
caught or bred by him. If the former--and he has promised to let me
know when he returns to Australia and his records--it adds to the
interest because it may add a year or two to the age of the old pair
which have been so persistent this year. They are certainly seven
years old, and may be considerably more.

A Mantell's Kiwi (. Apteryx australis mantelli), presented by the
Government of New Zealand, arrived by air at the end of September.
It travelled via Honolulu, San Francisco, and New York, receiving at
each stop kind hospitality and refreshment in the form of earthworms.
Mantell's is the only Kiwi inhabiting North Island ; three others
live in South Island and a fifth on Stewart Island. Since 1851 some
twelve Kiwis of four different forms have been kept in the Gardens,
one of them living for just over nineteen years and one or two laying
eggs.
Owing to its dislike of daylight, this present bird is being exhibited
for twenty minutes only each day at 2.45 p.m. ; it is, of course, very
active at night.

Members of the Club, 44 ; guests, 35 ; total, 79.
Members and guests stood in silence for a few moments as a tribute
to the memory of Miss Ethel Chawner and of the Duke of Bedford.
Before introducing the speaker for the evening the Chairman pre-
sented the Society's Medal to H. J. Indge, for breeding the Red-sided
Eclectus ; and to E. N. T. Vane for breeding the Moustache Parrakeet.
In his inimitable manner E. N. T. Vane gave a brief outline of the
trials and tribulations likely to be experienced by the would-be
bird photographer.
He then showed a selection from his collection of Kodachrome
transparencies to illustrate " Parrots in England To-day ". It is
probable that at present the Order Psittaciformes is represented in
English collections by about one hundred and forty species. Now that
the parrot ban has been reimposed it is highly improbable that some of
these will ever again be seen alive in England. It is Vane's intention
to build up as complete a photographic reference library as possible.
He would be glad to have information concerning the whereabouts of
rare species.
About seventy species and varieties were shown. Some of the more
interesting were the lutino Blue-fronted Amazon, Hooded, blue Indian
Ring-neck, and yellow Blossom-headed Parrakeet at Woburn ;

F. H. Rudkin, Sr., writes : " Have you noticed the colour change of
the beaks of young Derbyan Parrakeets ? When they first leave the
nest they all have red beaks. Then after about three weeks they all
turn black. But at or about their first moult the young males' beaks
turn red like their male parent, and the females' beaks remain black
like their mother's.
I had a pair of Valley Quail in an aviary. The hen laid about
twelve eggs and then died. The cock took over and sat for about
twenty days. He brought off eight chicks and has cared for and
brooded them well."

The trapping pool in St. James's Park is now being operated and
ringing is progressing in earnest. It is the aim to ring all the ornamental
wildfowl in the Park, including those which are pinioned. The birds
caught so far have been pinioned, but these are being ringed for
record purposes. The full-winged offspring of the pinioned stock
continues to elude capture but there is now a much better chance of
catching them. The Society's special blue rings are used by the Bird
Sanctuaries Committee, Ministry of Works. Ring size 4 is usually
recommended for Pintail, but the Birdkeeper, our member W. H.
Punter, has found size 3 a better fit, moving freely up and down the
tarsus.

Captain R. W. Veitch sends news of his Alexandrine Parrakeets :
" My seven-year-old pair this year reared four very good young.
This is the first time I have had four in a nest. Most broods have
been twos with occasional threes and I have bred them almost without
a break for 18 years. The strain is a very good one and the birds
are much bigger than imported birds. They have never shown any
sign of attempting a second brood, and the young birds stay in the
nest until almost as large as the parents, but only grow the two long
central tail-feathers after they leave the nest. My twenty-two year
hen is still well but laid no eggs this year."

MENABONI'S BIRDS. By Athos and Sara Menaboni. Michael
Joseph, Ltd., London, 1952. Price 845. net.
This book on American birds is beautifully presented and auto-
matically falls into the class of books suitable for handsome gifts.
There are no less than thirty-two plates in colour, thirteen in black and
white, and a large number of smaller black and white illustrations.
The originals of these have been loaned by the owners, private
collectors, the National Audubon Society, the American Museum of
Natural History, and the Kennedy Galleries, and were chosen as the
best examples of Menaboni's work.
The book opens with an introduction giving the life story of Athos
Menaboni and his wife Sara, both of whom, Italian born, migrated to
America where they met, and tells of their early struggles throughout
which a passionate love of birds predominated. The rest of the book
is written by Sara Menaboni, who relates in diary form the experiences
of herself and her husband with birds and beasts. Mrs. Menaboni
gives her impressions and opinions in a light conversational style, and
includes many personal details.
The majority of species depicted are not familiar to European
readers, but the Mallard, Pintail, and Ring-necked Pheasant are of
course similar to the European birds, and the Wood Duck, more
commonly known in Britain as the Carolina, and Canada Goose, are
both well known.
A brief description of the bird is given on the back of each colour
plate, and similar descriptions of the black and white plates are found
at the end of the book.
The reproductions of both colour and black and white plates have
achieved a beautiful softness of tone, but some are not so successful
as others.

Feathered Ones : the Beautiful Life of the Birds). By Richard
Gerlach. Illustrated. Fifth enlarged edition. 1953. 401 pages.
Hamburg : Claasen Verlag. DM. 16.80.
On rare, much too rare, occasions there comes to the desk of this
reviewer a book on birds whose author, very fortunately, combines
a keen knowledge of his subject-matter with an equally keen command
of language. The result is a piece of writing which at once brings the
reader not only much useful and often little-known information but
also information clothed in a style of writing which is a delight to read--
again and again.
Such book is the present volume--without question a work of art,
not likely ever to get out of date simply because it presents the truth
as the author sees it--accurately, spiritedly, charmingly. The book is
filled with highly individualized observations of bird life in all its
fascinating phases, mostly European birds, but also some foreigners.
There is nothing commonplace or trite about either Gerlach's observa-
tions or his writing. With special enthusiasm I read his fascinating
commentary on the songs of birds. I recall not a single bird book in
recent years which equals Gerlach's in point of piquancy and charm
of style. The American book which comes nearest to it in quality of
style and in keenness of observation and description is Dawson's The
Birds of California --a classic in its own right.
There are no dry-as-dust technical descriptions burdening Gerlach's
work ; every page in it sparkles with a delightful liveliness as it tells the
reader about habits, songs, and numerous other activities of birds.
Later sections in the book are devoted to bird migration ; and one of
the most informative, rarely found in bird books, is the one devoted to
biographical sketches of eminent bird students, such as Bechstein, the
Brehms, Heinroth, and others.
If you read German at all, be sure to add this book to your library.
It's the sort of thing you will want to read at least once a year, if not
more often.
Carl Naether.

Bengalee x Cordon Bleu Hybrids.
Although both Weaving Finches, Uroeginthus and Munia are well apart, never-
theless hybrids between birds of these two genera have been proved possible. A
Mr. G. Johnstone residing at Tenterden (Kent) had hybrids arise from the mating
of a male fawn and white Bengalee and a female Cordon Bleu. No birds, other
than Canaries and a pair of Zebra Finches were in the enclosure. As far as could
be observed the Bengalee appeared to undertake not only most of the feeding, but
a large share of the incubation. Five eggs were deposited, and four were hatched

apparently on consecutive days. One died at 11 days, and another at 42 days,
which was sent to me, and is still preserved in spirit. It is a small darkish brown bird
with white chin and a few white feathers at the edge of one wing, otherwise at this
period it resembled a very large dark brown juvenile Cordon Bleu without blue.
The form of mandibles and tarsi and elongated appearance favoured this bird rather
than its male parent. Regarding the two remaining birds, I understand that later
they became more like Bengalees and the male survivor showed a reddish-purple
patch on the cheek.

A TUDOR BIRD-CAGE
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993140272727273" page_id="56292015"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
Several readers have very kindly sent me suggestions regarding the bird most
likely to have been kept in this cage. In appearance it is said to bear a resemblance
to a West of Ireland lark cage, and this is probably the most likely species.
My special thanks are due to the editorial staff of Country Life who went to a great
deal of trouble in this matter. I am informed that there is a well-known picture
of a Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, painted shortly before his death in 1654. The
bird is shown, not in a cage, but perched on a box to which it is attached by a long
chain from one of its legs. It is suggested that possibly the example under notice
was more in the nature of a bird-box, to which the bird retired at night, being let
out on a chain during the day. In the old days it was apparently not uncommon
for birds to be kept in this manner.

BREEDING PARROTLET HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.901717875" page_id="56292015"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
Referring to the article by J. Dalborg-Johansen entitled " Breeding Parrotlet
Hybrids ", which appeared in the Sep tern ber-October issue of the Avicultural
Magazine, he says : "It seems to me that the hens of both pure species and the
hybrids are all alike."
The differences (other than those of plumage) mentioned by Neunzig are as
follows :--
Blue-wing Parrotlet : Length, 120 mm. ; beak, whitish ; feet, blackish grey ;
eyes, grey to dark brown.
Emerald-rumped Parrotlet : Length, 130 mm. ; beak, whitish ; feet, flesh-
coloured ; eyes, brown.
He further mentions a subspecies (Psittacula deliciosa Ridgw.) which is smaller
(120 mm.) and of a brighter green. The birds I bred (see Avicultural Magazine,
September, 1926) certainly were not larger than Blue-wings and must have belonged
to this subspecies. They came from Dutch Guiana and their pink legs definitely
enhanced their beauty.
