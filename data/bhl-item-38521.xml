The Society's Medal.
RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a
detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the
date of hatching of the young and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young and be
of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder. An
evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the breeder
from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will seriously prejudice
any other claims he or she may subsequently advance for the breeding of the same
or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2# inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894." On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to (name of recipient ) for rearing the young of (name of
species) a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom "

Third, Series. --Yol. X.--No. 1 .--All rights reserved. NOVEMBER, 1918.
A GOOD START.
" What's well begun is half clone " runs the proverb. This
thought dominates the mind as the Magazine with this number
commences yet another avicultural year. Already it is plain that
the literary output will be excellent, while our pictures will equal
the letterpress--for which the Editor thanks all those who have
stood by him with pen and camera.
The illustration opposite has been selected from a line series
of photographs taken by our member and contributor Mr. G. E. Low.
Although other birds are included in the series, the collection
primarily deals with sea-birds--Gulls and Puffins. We see, for
instance, a wild headland awhirl with white wings; downy infant
Kittiwakes squatting in their rocky nursery; or a regiment of white-
fronted, black-backed Puffins marshalled in absurd dignity at their
breeding-station, or whirring past the camera, half filling the plate
with birds. Taken on the rocky cliffs of Irish islands, the photo-
graphs are steeped in the very salt of the sea. One almost
hears--
" The myriad cry of wheeling ocean-fowl,

Surg.-Com. K. H. Jones,
THE FULMAR PETREL.
By Surgeon-Commander K. H. Jones, M.B., R.N.
There is little to entertain the mind and please the eye of
the ornithologist whose lot is cast during the winter months upon
the stormy sea, in the harsh weather of the northern portions of
the British Isles, and on the ocean which stretches thence towards
the inhospitable Polar regions. Such a one must always feel grateful
to the Fulmar Petrel--almost invariably his companion, no matter
how vile the weather or how far away from land he may find
himself.
It is under the most unpleasant and arduous conditions of
wind and weather that this wonderful wanderer is to be seen to the
greatest advantage. Its untiring energy, its matchless strength and
skill in flight, and the perfect grace of its aerial evolutions can hardly
fail to excite admiration long after they have become the commonest
subjects of daily observation. It is impossible to sail from any
harbour in the Orkneys or Shetlands without some of these birds
following in the vessel's wake. The number varies very much, and is
greater, as a rule, in the winter than during the summer months,
because, of course, in the latter season a considerable proportion of
the species resorts to its breeding haunts.
The Fulmar apparently does, to some extent, feed on garbage
food thrown overboard from ships, for an individual of this species,
or perhaps a small party, may be seen to settle on the often very
stormy water in the ship's wake, when the cook has emptied the
contents of the shoot. Compared, however, with the Gulls the
Petrels are very abstemious, and the noisy, greedy parties of ravenous
birds do not include many of the latter at any time--at least such
has been the writer's experience. It is far from easy when watching
a Fulmar to observe the bird in the act of flapping its wings.
Easily passing ahead of the ship, accommodating itself with-
out any apparent effort, after the manner of its kind, to any shift in
the wind, it continues its long and rapid glides and marvellous swerves,
now almost touching the water, which it beats Petrel fashion with its
feet, and now rising as high, or higher than the mast-head. It is a

curious fact that, although one may travel day after day on the
northern part of the North Sea or on the North Atlantic Ocean in
very rough weather and see hundreds of Fulmars all the time, it is
quite infrequently that one sees one of these birds resting on the
water, and yet, of course, they must sleep thereon.
From the sudden way in which a few Fulmars in mid-ocean
may augment their numbers it seems as if they tend to go about in
company, apart altogether from their habit of congregating to follow
certain ships.
It has been stated that a Fulmar, when flying near the shore,
shows the greatest reluctance to cross dry land; the same dis-
inclination to cross the deck of a ship, even when quite high above
it, is very noticeable. It does so, but very, very rarely. A Fulmar
may cross the stern of a ship a hundred times with the wind strongly
behind or ahead of the bird, and yet not once will it appear above
the head of an observer standing right aft.
These birds are remarkably tame, or unusually bold--which it
is is a matter of opinion -- but they often fly so close to the rail that
with a stick one could easily strike them. When passing close by
the observer in this manner the great pace at which they are
travelling is very obvious.
Associated with the Fulmar is very frequently the Kittiwake,
but this elegant and very skilful little aviator cannot compare with its
more robust companion, either in point of pace or endurance, and it
is very often seen resting on the water even in the heaviest sea, and
breaking waves disturb it not in the least.
If a wave or white-crested curler breaks into surf over a
swimming Fulmar it does not usually raise itself up in the water to
meet it as the Kittiwake does, but often it will take to flight, beating
the sea with its feet as it rises into the air.
It having on one occasion happened that the writer of these
notes had to cross the Atlantic from the North of Scotland to Nova
Scotia at the end of one year and to return in the beginning of the
next, notes were kept of the incidence of the Fulmar Petrel during
both voyages.
On the outward voyage on the first day not a few Fulmars
were noted, and this day was calm and bright.

Summer birds at Boehampton.
The second day was rather rough, and the Fulmars were
scarcer.
The third day but four or five Fulmars were observed.
On the fourth day Fulmars were scarce in the forenoon, but
abundant at 3.30 p.m.
The fifth day no Fulmars were seen until noon, after which
time they were abundant.
On the sixth day only two or three Fulmars were seen, at
about 3.30 p.m.
For the last two days, before reaching the Canadian coast, no
Fulmars appeared at all.
Returning to Europe after a few days, precisely the same
occurred as on the previous voyage--no Fulmars were seen for
the first two days after leaving Canada, and on the third a bird,
which may have been of this species, was observed just as it was
getting dark.
Fulmars were abundant on the fourth day.
The fifth day Fulmars were again much in evidence, and the
same is true of the sixth.
On the seventh day Fulmars were still flying astern with
Kittiwakes and one or two Great Black-backed Gulls, and the eighth
day saw the ship safely back in a British harbour.
The above notes, of course, lose some of their value from the
fact that the writer was not always on the upper deck during the
day ; at the same time some hours were spent daily, in all weathers,
in observation of the avifauna of the open sea. In the experience
of the writer the grey form of the Fulmar is a good deal scarcer
than the white.

Nightingales are busy, as seem all the other birds, and except in
Song Thrushes and Whitethroats I see very little scarcity. I have
heal'd and seen one Grasshopper Warbler. Of course my journeys
are limited, and I have not been able to get to " the spots " where
one can bet on finding a species. People often say they have
not seen this, that, or the other because they have not localised
the right quarters, and slight deafness is fatal in field work. I find
the ear the best of all tell-tales. So many things are invisible but
speak loudly.
I watched a pair of Willow Wrens here courting. They are
both awful fools, like most other creatures at such times. Yesterday
the Flycatchers were " making choice "--the cocks at this time can
do " bull rushes " at each other. Blue-Tits now are mostly making
the place noisy with what I call their "mouse-call." Few books
mention this first sign of amour in that species, which noise usually
is suspended when the young hatch. This is one of the most difficult
birds to keep and moult we have. I'd sooner keep Long-tailed Tits,
Wrens, Creepers and Goldcrests any day, and far preferably Sunbirds,
i. e. with the idea of betting which would survive the longest. The
Marsh Tit is the easiest kept Tit, followed by the Cole and Greater,
which are equally questionable as " long livers." Crested and Red-
sided Tits are better " livers," and Reedlings are, of course, very
little trouble. Owls were very noisy in the grounds last night,
i. e. S. aluco. Starlings have a nest here just above that of the
Lesser-spotted Woodpecker. I hope they won't disturb it. They
can't get in, of course, and Nuthatches usually fool them, but
they generally have more wits than a Green Woodpecker, often
causing the latter to shift.

(Reprinted from the ' Zoologist.')
The first Spoonbills were a fine pair seen on Breydon Broad
by Mr. B. B. Riviere on May 1st, 1913; wind S.E. to S.W.,
force 2. Many other birds were on the mud-flats, including five

Mr. J. H. Gurney,
them travellers going north or east. From that date until August 16th
there were twenty-six days out of one hundred and six on which the
watcher was able to register the presence of Spoonbills. According
to his carefully kept notes, the longest period during which there was
not a Spoonbill on the Broad was from May 29th to June 11th. On
June 25th Mr. C. R. Gurney and I had a distinct view of three, and
on July 6th there were four, this being the largest number seen by
the watcher on any one day. In recording the visits of Spoonbills
Mr. Jaryhas always been requested to carefully observe the direction
of the wind. Accordingly, in looking back at his notes for many
years, we learn that forty-four Spoonbills have come to Breydon
Broad with a N.E. wind and seven with a N.W.; twenty more have
come with a W. wind, eight with a S.W., and six with a S. wind.
These observations were all made in April, May, or June, and a
good deal may be gathered from them. Evidently in the spring it is
a N.E. wind which generally brings Spoonbills ; but this is curious,
because in April and May their desire on leaving southern Europe
would be to migrate north, or perhaps north-west. Do they then
prefer to migrate with a wind which is against them ? There is,
however, another solution, namely, that it is a N.E. wind whereby
they are checked, and without which many would pass on without
halting on the Breydon mud-flats. This latter theory seems highly
probable, and it certainly appears that when the wind has been S., a
few only (fourteen in about as many years) have stopped on Breydon
Broad, the rest presumably wending their way to a breeding-place
in Holland.
Mr. F. C. Jourdain is of opinion that the largest Spoonbill
settlement in Europe is probably that at Obedszka-Bara, in the
Gegenwart (see Jakob Schenk, ' Aquila,' 1908, p. 245), but it is
not likely that our Breydon birds nest there, or even pass it on
migration.
We were sorry to miss the pair of Montagu's Harriers from
the marsh where they had been last year. However, this disappoint-
ment was more than balanced when a little before half-past five a
fine Bittern was viewed approaching with lazy flight, extended legs,
and retracted neck from the same direction as one had come from
when Mr. Bonhote and I were on this Broad one warm July day two

or three years ago. On perceiving itself watched by three people,
it rose considerably, but soon dropped again to its original level,
some fifteen feet above the reeds, among which we eventually saw it
settle. I should have liked at once to have searched for the nest,
but the owner was obdurate, fearing that the birds might forsake it,
a feeling with which one could not but sympathise. The return of
the Bittern to Norfolk of late years has been accompanied by a
general desire to protect it on the part of the Broad owners, and it
is hoped that this good action will have the support of the public
who use our Broads in summer. The " boom " of a Bittern is a
curious sound, not often to be heard ; it is hushed in the middle of
the day, but towards evening this nocturnal " Butter-bump," as it
has been called in allusion to its note, becomes more lively. By
listening carefully, we could easily distinguish five successive "gasps,"
rising in crescendo , and terminating in the deep " bump," whence its
name, but sometimes there were only three " gasps," which agrees
with the statement of Francis Willughby that the number is always
uneven.* Whether it goes on serenading its mate all night is hard
to say ; on the present occasion I can testify that its " boom " could
be heard up to 11 p.m. and again at 4 a.m. the next morning-- i.e.
sixteen minutes after sunrise--breaking forth about once in four
minutes, and this went on with clock-like regularity until past six
o'clock. I believe it is not yet settled whether the female Bittern
can boom or not, but at any rate she does not do it nearly as loudly
nor as often as the male. Mr. W. P. Pycraft, in a recent article (' The
British Bird Book,' iv, p. 338), leaves the question open, merely
remarking that the syrinx, which is usually considered to be the
voice organ in birds, presents no modification. An old eighteenth
century naturalist, Dr. Lamb, however, mentions having found in
repeated dissections a loose membrane on the inner side of the
windpipe in the male, wdiich the female does not possess (' Zoologist,'

1880, p. 318). It is through the nostrils, which are distinctly larger
than a Heron's, that the sound is believed to come.

Mr. J. Weir,
MY BULLFINCH.
By Miss D. Hussey Freke.
I reared my hen Bullfinch " Loomoola " from the nest, with
five others, from twelve days old. In the autumn I parted with the
five, and Loomoola being a hen I let her out of doors; but as she
repeatedly came back and was so very tame I decided to keep her.
She was seldom shut into her cage, but stayed in my bedroom--
always coming to me when I came in or called her. I was perfectly
devoted to the little treasure, and was quite miserable when, in the
second spring, she flew out of the window and remained out for a
fortnight. During that time I could never see her, and then one
afternoon I heard her calling in the kitchen garden. As I was ill
at the time I asked my mother to go and put the cage in the path
for her. The same afternoon she went in with delight, and mother
brought her in to me. In a few days' time, to my astonishment and
delight, she began picking up all the bits of hair and fluff off the
carpet, and began building a nest on a bracket close to my bed,
placing it behind a china pot; the following week it was finished,
and she began to lay her eggs--five. I was fearfully excited to see
if she would hatch any of them, and in due time four little birds
appeared. I put soft food--egg, etc.--in a saucer, and she fed and
reared them all, and never minded a bit how many strangers came to
look at her. When they were able to fly I put them in a cage and
took them away. Alas, the following winter my absolute treasure
was trodden on, and died on Christmas Day. I have reared Bull-
finches in quantities, but never had such a darling, or one that I was
quite so devoted to, as she knew my step, and the moment she heard
me come into the house she began calling, and would often fly out
into the hall to meet me coming up the stairs. I seldom came in
without bringing a berry or bit of evergreen for her.
HAMPSHIRE BIRDS.

and heather, and a wood adjoining. It used to be part of a large
estate, and the house I live in and the nearest one are both only a
few years old. A good deal of the undergrowth in one direction has
been cleared, which banished the Nightingale, but recently one seems
to have returned. One can stand at the door and listen to several
Nightingales singing, also the Night-jar&amp;apos;s note can be heard. Once
a Cuckoo seemed to call nearly all night. One appeared for a while
to be constantly in the neighbourhood, and a year or so ago a young
one was being fed in close proximity. Some birds seem scarcer
since the gorse has been cut near the house, as, for instance, the
Stone Chat and Linnet as breeding-birds. I believe I found the
nest of the Cirl Bunting with one young bird a few years back, but
there has been no sign of the species lately. A full list of birds seen
or heard without going many yards from the door might be weari-
some, but I may say that the Goldfinch is numerous, as also are the
Linnet, Skylark, Blackbird and Thrush, Willow Warbler, Green
Woodpecker, Tawny Owl, Starling and Missel Thrush. I cannot say
much for the good behaviour of boys in relation to birds here any
more than in other districts.
I have heard some very good vocalists in the Thrush and
Blackbird ranks here. Birds occurring on migration or found in
the neighbourhood include the Little Owl (or so I am told it is);
I have one stuffed, which was picked up dead. There is a
railway-line near the house, where the Corn-crake, although it does
not seem to stay here, has been picked up several times. One meets
with Partridge (both kinds), Pheasant, Barn Owl, Wryneck (not
much heard this year by me), Meadow Pipit (ditto, ditto), Lapwing,
Snipe, Jack Snipe, Water Rail, Woodcock, and the Redpoll in
winter. The Heron frequently passes over.
There is a very large rookery at Hinton Admiral: Jackdaws
are numerous, with Rooks ; Sea Gulls of one or two kinds are often
in evidence, and nearly all the well-known Warblers and Tits.
Magpies and Jays appear to be more unmolested than previously ; I
trust this will be permanent. I have noted the Spotted Flycatcher,
Nuthatch and Red-backed Shrike in the neighbourhood. Swallows
and Martins do not seem very numerous, and as yet not many
Swifts. If one can believe it, the Christchurch neighbourhood,

Mr. James J. Cash,
about half an hour's ride on the way to Bournemouth, was at least
at one time a noted place for birds. Of course the New Forest is
near. There is a museum of British birds at Christchurch, and I
believe a great number are claimed as local captures. I have heard
something about the Crossbill breeding not many miles away.
I lost my Jay by death this week ; it screamed very loudly
one night, and since then it had intermittently strong convulsive
seizures, rallied remarkably one night and next morning, but
relapsed and eventually died. I left it at night very collapsed and
in the morning it was dead. I never noticed it plucking itself,
but for several years it seemed to be stripped on the breast too
early in the year for Nature. I have a Magpie, a hen, which is
very lively and energetic ; as far as I can see the Magpie is of a more
inquiring nature than the Jay. It seems to think more, although
the Jay no doubt is cunning, but the expression on the faces of the
two birds is strikingly different. The Jay looks surprised, the
Magpie modest. The Magpie laid six eggs last year, and several
the previous one ; I have seen none this year. No eggs, either,
from any of my birds this year that I can recall, although they seem
in very good condition. I have a pair of Blackbirds at large in the
bird-house; the hen has built a nest, but I do not know of any eggs.
I have had all my birds for some years. The cock Combassou (I
have only one of that species) is still practically in full colour. The
Avadavat is nearly in eclipse, and the Grey Waxbill which I have had
now from four to five years is bright and strong. A number of
my birds are hand-reared by myself almost entirely, the smallest one
being a hen Hedge-Sparrow.
Later.-- The hen Blackbird has since laid two eggs. While
I was away, she escaped, and was not recaptured, and now appears
to be missing.

real--vital, indeed--yet, judging from much that we have read in the
press, and seen and heard, during the past four years of war, this
fact is not appreciated as it should be.
Every student of bird life must be filled with indignation at
much that has been going on--at the folly of allowing Plovers' eggs
to be collected for the table, for example ; at the urging of children to
collect the eggs and to kill the young of " Sparrows," which in
practice means destroying many species of small birds of great use-
fulness to the community ; in short, at the folly of thinking that
bird life is man's enemy and not his friend. It was a true remark in
a recent number of this Magazine that " the wild or native birds of
every country are there to benefit the farmers, the fruit-growers, and
the stock-breeders."
While practically every bird is found to do more good than
harm, insectivorous birds should be protected very zealously. We
simply could not do without them ; gardening and farming would
soon become impossible. Bird life must be encouraged and
protected. Dr. C. Gordon Hewitt well says that " birds are the
most powerful insecticides we have." Too many folks are alive only
to the damage that some birds do ; they do not see the good the
birds are waging at all times and seasons.
The question has been well asked and answered: " What
would be the state of our permanent pastures if there were no birds ? "
" In a few years thousands of acres would be bared by subterranean
insects. Were it not for Rook, Jackdaw, Starling, Plover and Gull, the
white grub, wire-worm, leather-jackets, etc., would increase in such
enormous numbers that the grass would be destroyed wholesale."
This brings to mind those great winter flocks of birds which roam
across the pastures and arable land from autumn until spring--the
snowy Gulls like winter drifts upon the brown earth, the clamouring
Rooks and Daws darkening the grasslands, the flickering wings
of Lapwings innumerable where potatoes and turnips have
recently been lifted. Think of the vast amount of grubs
and insects destroyed by these birds in the course of a winter
season !
It has been proved that the destruction of Lapwings, Rooks
and Starlings had much to do with the recent plague of antler moth

Mr. Allen Silver,
caterpillars among the hill pastures of Derbyshire and elsewhere.
There is no doubt, of course, that much harm can be done by certain
birds at times, but this should not blind us to their usefulness in
other directions, and to cry out for the extermination of any species
is, in the writer's opinion, wrong.
It is good to find that the Barn and Tawny Owls are decidedly
more numerous in Cheshire than they were a dozen years ago. On
the other hand it is disquieting to miss the always-useful Lapwings
from many old nesting haunts; great as are the winter flocks of
these Plovers, one can travel for many miles in spring without seeing
more than an occasional nesting pair.
We have always before us the tireless activities of the
Swallows and Swift, and we should appreciate to the full the cease-
less energies of the Flycatchers, the various summer Warblers, the
small fry (Tits, Goldcrest, and Creeper), Robin, Wren and Hedge
Sparrow, Wagtails and Pipits. These are but some of many intensely
useful feathered creatures. The Kestrel, too, must have special
mention. It has been heartening to see more than usual this
autumn. One or more have been seen most days, high in the windy
sky, hovering, gliding, sailing, in graceful, perfect flight. Perhaps
the shortage of gamekeepers accounts for this !

It may interest aviculturists to know that seven hybrids were
bred this season between a male Lesser Redpoll and female Twite by
a Mr. Efisio Azario, a London bird-keeper. The male parent boasted
four or five years' cage life; the female was a comparatively recently-
caged bird. Owing to aviary disturbances one only of the hybrid
nestlings was reared, and that by Canary foster parents. Although
sober in colouring, it is quite a charming little bird, and the characters
of its parents are almost equally merged in it. This is by no means
a common feature in Finch hybrids. The bill presents the character

than in the case of a pure example of C. flavirostris. The primaries
mainly resemble those of a Twite, the white webs being washed with
a sandy tone. The bird, although Redpoll-like in build, is nearly as
long as a Twite. There is no doubt as to its genuineness, either from
its appearance or from the details concerning its breeding, about
which I made full inquiries when visiting the owner.
A correspondent of mine, a Mr. John Angus, of Polmont,
Stirlingshire, bred this season three hybrids between a male Gold-
finch and a hen Twite in a cage 19 in. x 14 in. x 10 in. They were
reared by foster-parents, and I believe two are males and one a
female. They have not yet acquired full plumage, so at present
I am not aware whether they will exhibit a black cap or "blaze.&amp;quot;'
The blaze is fairly pronounced in mules between the Goldfinch
and the Linnet.*
The primary webs on the birds are yellowish, not brown or
white, or jonquil yellow. The cheeks are streaked and the mantle
described as speckled, as also are those of the flanks. The rectrices
at present are very much like those of the Twite, except that they
are yellowish in tone, no black and white Goldfinch-pattern being
noticeable. There is at present no chestnut on the upper breast,
no white cheek, no dark cap. The bill, however, is interesting,
being " Twite " yellow at the base and streaked on the upper
mandible like that of the Goldfinch, and is fairly long.
Birds of this kind and family are readily obtainable, and
aviculturists should, whilst exotic species are rare, turn their
attention to producing new British hybrids. Mules between Siskin
and Bullfinch and Canary and Chaffinch would fetch high prices
apart from their interest. Bunting hybrids are wanted, and also
any purely insectivorous, i. e. (not seed-sheller) hybrids.
I should be pleased at any time to give information relating
to what has been done in this direction, having for some good
number of years watched experiments closely (see vol. ii, No. 12,
3rd series). The Chaffinch at present has only been crossed
with the Brambling and the Greenfinch, and I think could be
further used.

bird-lore. I noticed a young Cuckoo being fed by some small bird,
bringing it a nearly full-grown larva of the Fox Moth. I think it
would be difficult to obtain the larva fully fed during the time the
Cuckoo is in the nest. What bird would bring a hairy larva to feed
it ? The Cuckoo is said to feed considerably on hairy caterpillars,
but does its foster parent bring it such food ? Is it possible that
the smaller bird does it through sheer worry, exhaustion, and
desperation? I should like to go into the subject.

" The old Cuckoos have all left, but the young are now on
migration. To-day Mr. E. T. Roberts received a well-grown bird,
evidently a flier, and having the curiosity to examine its stomach,
found therein on dissection a dense mass of rather long hairs, which
had effectually insinuated themselves into the lining of the bird's
gizzard. There were three good-sized caterpillars in its throat,
still undigested, and these resembled the larvae of the Tiger Moth or
Fox Moth, both of which are very hairy, and no doubt similar larvae
supplied the hairs in the gizzard. That somehow or other cater-
pillars' long hairs frequently find their way into the cuticle of the
gizzards of Cockoos has long been known, but it must be rare to find
so many as in the present case."

HAND-REARED v. WILD-CAUGHT BIRDS.
By Allen Silver.
I do not collect eggs now, but for years have continuously
gone nesting. We seldom, if ever, take either eggs or young. Earlier
in life I got together a good representative collection of local species,
and of course reared by hand the young of many British birds. Now
for reference I can examine collections, and prefer to deal with
caught birds rather than have the tie of hand-rearing. The only
advantage in hand-rearing is that you can retain " pets," but a pet
bird is inclined to lose the charm of its natural contour--an attraction
(at any rate to me) usually shown by a steadied wild bird. Tame
birds are almost useless as show specimens. They usually act the
fool and want to fight, and consequently spoil their qualities whilst
being judged.
I have in my possession a cock Goldfinch with a white
&amp;lt;l blaze," i.e. no red on head. This is the second of this kind I
have had. I expect, however, it will eventually have one. The other
one produced a palish blaze the second year. Wild Goldfinches will
soon be losing their light wing-tips and tail-tips now. When they
have reared two broods like other birds they become very worn out
and dowdy.
HYBRID WIGEON.
By W. Shore-Baily.
I am sending you photos of some hybrid Chili x English
Wigeon that I thought might possibly be of interest. The curious
thing about these birds is their almost exact resemblance to the
American Wigeon or Baldpate. The portrait of this bird, in
Thorburn's recently-published work, might well have been drawn
from either of the Ducks shown in the photograph. No doubt it
would be easy to find differences between these hybrids and the
American bird if both were examined when in the hand, but the only
difference noticeable when they are upon the water--and that, too,
at but a few yards' distance--is the larger space covered with rich

metallic green on the heads of the hybrids. One wonders whether
there could be any possibility of Mareca aviericana having been
produced by this cross. Mareca sibilatrix is, of course, a South
American bird, but it would probably reach as far north as Central
America. Mareca &amp;apos;penelo&amp;apos;pe still occurs in North America as a winter
visitor to some of the Eastern States, and has even been found in
Florida and California, although it must be very scarce in the latter
State, as the writer, with five years' duck-hunting experience there,
failed to meet with a specimen. Of course, in prehistoric days, both
M. &amp;apos;penelope and M. sibilatrix may have been found in the same
latitude. At any rate, this seems rather an interesting speculation.
Another rather unusual circumstance connected with this occurrence
was the fact that the female Wigeon deserted her husband and took
up with the Chili drake, whilst the deserted bird mated up with his
own daughter, a duck bred on the pond the previous year and left
unpinioned ! Five hybrids were reared, all of which were drakes.
These were practically indistinguishable one from the other. This
cross has previously occurred at the Zoo, and we are told that the
young ones closely resembled the Chilian parent.

Mr. Allen Silver writes :
" In colour-feeding a bird to get its value we know that the
' feed ' must be given just before and during moult and for some
time after, and in the case of many breeders of birds (Canaries),
where colour value means much, they keep it up off and on until the
end of the show season. There is one point with reference to the
Blackbird, and that is colour-toning of the yellow bill and eyelids
can be effected by feeding after the moult. In fact, one of the oldest
exhibitors of Blackbirds of my acquaintance once whispered in my
ear that a Blackbird was spoilt by being ' fed ' during the moult,
which I have since observed to be the case. This old man used to
turn them out the shiniest deep black imaginable, with beautiful rich
amber bills (not chough colour). It is to be hoped some dead-feather
professor will work the matter out on living birds."

Although not as a rule entering into the intricacies of avi-
cultural routine, Comparative Anatomy and Pathology nevertheless
claim their due place in our many-sided, fascinating science. The
Editor has received a Report on the post-mortem examinations
now or lately conducted by our Pathologist, Prof. Wooldridge, on
behalf of the Society, and his notes on the birds and the causes of
death make very interesting reading.
Analysis of the Report reveals considerable prevalence of
pneumonia, attributable to our variable climate, though when a bird
has been thoroughly acclimatised, as we all know, it will stand a
wonderful amount of exposure. Fatty degeneration of the organs
or actual deposit of fat also occur, want of exercise or improper
feeding being responsible for these conditions, though fatty degenera-
tion may also be caused by sheer old age. Enteritis (inflammation
of the intestines) may be due to chill or error in diet; tubercle and
intestinal parasites, unfortunately, are only too readily brought into
our aviaries by newly-imported birds.

THE EMBRYONIC LIFE OF THE OSTRICH.

Translated by the Editor from the 'Revue Framjaise d'Ornithologie.'
Natural incubation being often very difficult and restricted in
scope, artificial methods have assumed a growing importance. We
have had to employ only the latter methods at the Ostrich farm at
Mekn6s--in the end at least. The study of the advantages and draw-
backs of each of these methods will appear in the body of this work,
which has the single aim of explaining the most remarkable features
noticed in the course of the embryonic life of the Ostrich.
Incubation lasts from forty to forty-five days ; it varies with
the strength of the chick, and lasts from forty-four to forty-five days
in cold weather, which causes many failures. One need not attach
importance to the appearance of the shell; it is enough for it to be
normal with the pores permeable to the air. The shadow-test gives
no guide.
The Germ at the Beginning of Incubation.
As in fresh eggs, the discus proligerus is alone visible, so that
the early shadow in the egg of the Ostrich does not permit one to
separate at once clear from fertile eggs. It is at this period that the
embryos readily die ; they already show bulging of the head with

prominent and relatively enormous orbits, the rest of the body
forming a still shapeless mass recognisable as the beginning of the
blood-vessels ; the whole is contained in a very fragile vitelline mem-
brane.
The Embryo from the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Day.
Growth is rapid at this period ; the alimentary reserves are
massed in a pouch outside the umbilicus and linked to it by a
pedicle traversed by nutrient vessels. The head is formed, and the
whole is surrounded by an envelope full of a yellow fluid strictly
comparable to the amniotic fluid of mammalia; this is the germinal
vesicle which is developed, thanks to the vitellus. Macroscopically
the egg reveals a mass swimming in the midst of white and yellow
fluid. It is at this period that the mortality of the embryos is
greatest.
The Embryo from the Tiventieth to the Thirtieth Day.
Mortality is rarer at this stage ; the embryo is a little more
developed; in every case it possesses all the organs which are
essential. The head is well formed, as are also the limbs, which have
claws and even scales in the lower parts; the beak is still soft,
though defined. The vitelline membrane is richly nourished,
increasingly so as one approaches the nutrient zone; the external
vascular network sends out slender branches, which thicken at the
level of the air-chamber to allow greater aeration of the blood.
The Last Days of Incubation.
The well-developed embryo completes its organisation and
begins to move. Its shadow, of the greatest value, allows one to
follow its progress.
The skin is folded, especially at the level of the limbs. The
head is truncated; the body is clothed with down rolled into tubes,
which at birth give it the appearance of a Hedgehog. The abdomen
is retracted, all the nutritive vitelline mass being outside and
attached to the umbilicus by a large vascular pedicle. The vitelline
membrane is thickened and provided with great blood-vessels, whose

dimensions attain half the thickness of a lead-pencil. It is these
that prepare the respiratory functions of the embryo and assist
exchanges with the external air. The air-chamber increases during
the last hours of embryonic life ; it alone is transparent, all the rest
is opaque, but the movements of the embryo are visible.
Hatching.
The vitellus and the yellow fluid contained in the two pouches
return into the interior of the abdomen ; the vitellus constitutes a
food reserve which allows the chick to live from eight to ten or even
fifteen days without taking any other nourishment.
This absorption of the vitellus and fluid takes place several
hours before hatching. The fluid soaks into the subcutaneous tissue
and swells up the neck and feet, markedly increasing the size of the
body; the skin is no longer wrinkled, but regularly distended. The
chick is ready when the vitellus is deprived of its blood-supply, when
the body occupies the entire shell. But it is necessary in order to be
free for it to attack the fibrous, highly resistant membrane which
lines the shell. The chick uses its saliva: around the beak the
membrane becomes actually macerated, losing all its tenacity; the
blows which the little thing instinctively delivers end in the egg-shell
itself being attacked. Exceptionally, in artificial incubation, the
chick liberates itself; if this occurs, it is a sign of strength. In
other cases it rests with the operator to complete the hatching.

These lovely Fruit-Pigeons, clad in green, golden-yellow and
mauve, and as good to eat as they are to look at, are common all the
year round in the Gambia, but are wanderers, moving in parties from
place to place as the different trees which provide their food ripen
and are finished. At the beginning of the rainy season (June) a
more definite migration occurs. This is particularly noticeable in
Bathurst on the coast, where for a week or a fortnight large flocks
consisting entirely of young birds pass over in a more or less northerly
direction. At this time the " Gang " trees, a kind of evergreen fig,
which produce a low-grade rubber, are in fruit. On these the Pigeons
feed as they travel, and when flighting from one to the other offer
pretty shooting. Another similar movement takes place in the
reverse direction towards the end of the rainy season (October), but
this is a much smaller affair--less regular, and including old as well
as young birds. These flights vary considerably in size from year to
year. I can remember occasions when thousands would come over
daily, while in other years the numbers have been comparatively
small, and the short journey to the cemetery, where the best shoot-
ing usually is, not worth making. I have known the Gambia for
eighteen years, and I feel sure that in the last six or seven there have
never been anything like the numbers of Green Pigeon there used to
be in these flights.
The breeding season of these birds begins about March, in
some cases perhaps earlier; at any rate, I have a note that on Feb-
ruary 3rd, 1909, I shot a female, which dropped a fully-formed egg,
and I have frequently seen nests quite early in March. These are of
the most flimsy possible construction--a few twigs and rootlets
twisted together to form an apology for a nest, and situated in such
an apparently precarious situation that one wonders that the single
white egg ever remains in position and safety; it can always be easily
seen from below. The commonest site is a tabu tree, a large-leaved
evergreen, towards the extreme end of the wide-spreading branches,
where it sways about with every breeze. About 10 to 12 ft. from the
ground is where one generally finds the nest, but no doubt more are
built higher up and escape one's observation. I expect I have seen
more nests in Commissioners' compounds than elsewhere, as such
would come directly under notice, and in such situations the hen sits

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
very closely, and never seems disturbed by the people who are con-
stantly passing beneath her, Instinct has no doubt taught genera-
tions of Green Pigeons that in a tree immobility is their surest
safeguard. When the young bird is hatched it maintains its hold on
the nest, which it so quickly and so continually outgrows, by automati-
cally gripping with its feet one of the leaf-twigs to which the nest is
fixed. This clutch is quite a passive but very powerful one, and this
habit of holding tight to the perch persists in young birds for long
after they have left the nest. When a young one is shot in a tree it
nearly always remains hung up by the feet for some time, though
quite dead and the grip entirely due to muscular contraction. With
old birds one may at times hang for a moment or two; with young
a much longer lodgment is the rule.
Green Pigeons are essentially arboreal in their habits, and
haunt the higher branches of big trees, though they may he tempted
to the lower ones by ripe fruit when that on the upper branches is
finished. The natives say they never come to the ground even to
drink, and I have never seen one there unless wounded or dead.
Their food consists almost entirely of the fruit of different trees of
the " bush "--notably " tabus " and " sotos," two kinds of wild fig.
In one of these when in fruit one is nearly always sure of finding a
party of Green Pigeons feeding. A harvest-time ripening " basso "
is eaten as an addition to the ordinary fruit diet. This " basso " is
the largest of the native millets, and is much the same as what at
home we know as " dharri." In November, just before complete
ripening, this grain is soft and succulent, and is then greedily eaten
by such birds as Glossy Starlings and the like. At this season one
frequently shoots Green Pigeons with their crops absolutely overflow-
ing with the soft, juicy grains of this corn ; at other times one never
finds anything in their crops or stomachs hut the seeds and debris of
bush-fruits.
Adult birds are rather shy and wary, but give quite pretty
shooting if one gets them coming over, as often happens if large
numbers of them are about and several trees are ripe. If one waits
near such a tree and fires just as a party slows down to alight, they
offer easy shots; but flying free, their flight, though straight, is
deceptive as to speed, and wants more swing than one would think.

When out absolutely for the pot, as is so often the case out here, one
finds them most difficult to spot when feeding in a tree, as their
colours blend so well with their surroundings and make them almost
impossible to see as long as they keep still, as they do if at all sus-
picious. The young in their more uniform green are even harder to
make out, but are much more restless when feeding and in all ways
less wary, so when seen are much easier to shoot. They, unlike the
older birds, have no knowledge of guns, and after a shot will return
again and again to the same tree, in spite of losing one or more at every
shot. Old ones never do this; they are away with a dash at the first
shot, and only return when they think all must be safe again. A habit
they have, however, of perching on some big leafless tree, like the
" monkey-bread " (baobab), to take from this post of vantage a good
look round before going right away or before on their return actually
alighting on their food tree, often aids one to fill the larder and at
the same time provides good shooting if one finds a stand between
one of their look-out trees and their feeding-place. Their note, too,
is a useful guide to their whereabouts--this a peculiar one, a sort of
chuckle, not easy to imitate (though some of the native small boys
do it to perfection), but once heard never forgotten. It may be more
or less represented thus: "Boo-whoo; whu, whu, whup!" the last
short note being accented, going suddenly up and being followed by
a sharp break, after which the strain is repeated.
The Mandingo name for the Green Pigeon is " Putu-puto,&amp;quot;
and in some parts of the country the young are given a different
name, " Teyto-preto." For a long time I thought that we had two
species here, but now am almost certain that what I thought was a
second is only a stage between the all-green plumage of the red-
beaked young and that of the yellow-breasted adult. The full
dress is probably not obtained till the bird is more than a year
old; at any rate, I have seen birds in the intermediate plumage
nesting, and believe that they may do so also in that of the earlier
stage.
The following is a description of an adult: The whole head,
neck, throat, chest and sides of chest greenish-grey, sharply defined
in front against the upper margin of the yellow abdomen and against

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
right down to beak and cere; there is no "bald front." Back and
rest of the upper surface, including the inner wing-coverts and upper
tail-coverts, a light olive-green. On the primary-coverts is a clearly
outlined patch, an inch or so in diameter, of purplish-mauve. The
border-feathers of the whole upper wing-coverts are blackish-grey,
each feather bordered externally with lemon-yellow, to form a narrow
transverse bar of this colour across the wing. Of the flight-feathers
the primaries are uniformly grey above, the secondaries grey with
narrow lemon-yellow outer edges. The under surface of the whole
wing, including the under wing-coverts and auxiliaries, is a beautiful
grey-blue. The sides of the body and thighs are French grey. The
whole abdomen is bright golden-yellow--the bird's most conspicuous
feature--fading into pale buff near the vent. The tail-feathers are
above slatey-blue, the terminal half-inch of each paler than the rest,
below black with pale grey ends. The under tail-coverts are red-
brown, more or less mottled or tinged with pale fawn or white, and
consist of elongated pointed feathers. The bill is bluish-grey, the
cere dull purplish ; the legs, which are feathered nearly all the way
down the tarsus, yellow-ochre, exactly the colour of good pie-crust;
the iris magenta with a mauve-blue inner ring.
Length 12J in., i.e. about a third smaller than an English
Wood-Pigeon.
The young differ considerably from the adults. They are
distinctly smaller and entirely lack the yellow breast, this part and
nearly the whole of the plumage being green ; the shoulder patch,
too, is much smaller and a much paler, duller mauve. The legs are
as in the old bird, but the bill is pinkish-grey with a sealing-wax base
and cere. The iris is brown.
In the intermediate or semi-adult plumage to which I have
referred the breast is yellow, but the patch is smaller and much
paler than in the adult, and the rest of the plumage, both green and
mauve, altogether duller. In such birds, too, the bill is pale horn
colour in life, but turns blue-grey after death, and there is no wax-
red base or cere. The iris is entirely magenta without any blue
inner ring.
One also sometimes sees an earlier intermediate stage. The
following is a description from my note-book of two such birds which

I have occasionally tried to keep these birds alive in confine-
ment, but have never had any success, though one rains I remember
there were three in Bathurst, which had been taken from the nests,
and which lived for months at any rate. They were fed chiefly on
well-boiled, sweetened rice, and never had the chance of getting any of
their natural food, the bush-figs. Those I have had I could never get
to even look at rice or anything of the sort. They would eat readily
ripe figs, etc., but the difficulty of providing a constant supply of this
food soon puts an end to the experiment. Others, however, have
had better fortune, for I remember seeing African Green Pigeons
once or twice in the Zoo, and sullen, uninteresting birds they appear
to be in captivity.
As food Green Pigeons are excellent, always fat and tasty, but,
like anything else one gets too much of, soon pall. I should not like
to say how many I must have eaten in my time, but I know that the
saying, "No one can eat a Pigeon a day for a fortnight," has no
meaning in the Gambia. Of Pigeons of one sort or other, two or
three a day are more like the Protectorate chop-routine, and that,
too, for months on end. If they do not appear as roast, stew, etc.,

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
they are sure to have gone into the soup. The skin when cooked is
yellowish-green and the bones bright yellow.
The Guinea Pigeon (Columba guinea , Linn., 1766) (Guinea).
Range: West Africa; Senegambia to Nigeria; N.E. and E. Africa
to Kilimanjaro. (Brit. Mus. Hand List.)
This, the largest Gambian Pigeon, is commonly called here
the "Rhun Pigeon," because it is only found in those districts where
these tall bulbous-trunked palms grow ( Alyssus , I believe). On these,
among the stalks of their huge, fan-shaped leaves, the Guinea Pigeons
roost and nest. They are, therefore, only locally distributed in the
Gambia, but where found are in most places quite common, though
near wharves and factories they are certainly rarer than they were
ten to fifteen years ago. During this period these places have
increased rapidly in numbers and size. These Pigeons, unlike most
of our others, seem easily frightened by the near neighbourhood of
man, although they are never much sought after by gunners, for
their flesh is dry and tasteless at its best, and at certain times almost
uneatable. One never sees them in flocks even where they are
common, but in pairs, or at times parties of never more than six--
probably an old pair and two nests of young, as these remain with
their parents for some time after leaving the nest. Such a pair or
party keeps within comparatively narrow limits, except when flying
to and from water. With them and the rhun palms is commonly
associated one of our grey Hawks (the Rufous-necked Merlin, Falco
rjificollis, I think), which also nests in these palms, and which
appears to live in perfect peace and harmony with the Pigeons, even
to the extent of a pair of each making use of the same tree for
breeding purposes.
The flight of these Pigeons is comparatively slow, and accom-
panied with frequent wing-beats as a rule, though at times when
flighting to water they put the pace on and fly more strongly. They
can often be seen wheeling slowly about the tops of the palms, much
as tame Pigeons do about the house-tops at home.
Their note is a rapidly repeated " Koo-ku-ku-ku," the later
coos getting shorter and shorter and following one another more
quickly.

The most noteworthy features of this bird are the bifurcated
neck-feathers, the white triangular wing-spots, and the striking
contrast between the clear grey of the back and the maroon-brown
of the wings, etc.
An adult may be described as follows: The head, whole back,
including the upper tail-coverts and the under surface from chin to
vent are a beautiful clear ash-grey. A broad collar of chestnut and
white feathers, each bifurcated at its end, surrounds the neck. The
scapulars and adjacent part of the wing-coverts are uniform maroon-
brown, the median coverts maroon-brown with a triangular white
mark at the end of each feather, the lowest row of coverts and those
near the outer edge of the wing grey with similar white tips, which
diminish in size from within outwards. The quills are dark-grey
both above and below, and the under wing-coverts ash-grey like the
breast. The tail-feathers are ash-grey, faintly banded once with
darker grey, and broadly tipped with black. The bill is lead-coloured,
the legs pink in front, dirty flesh-colour (as are also the toes) behind.
The iris is dull pale amber. The large bare circumorbital area is
purplish-crimson. Length varies from 14 to 15 in. according to the
age (and perhaps the sex) of the bird.
The young resemble the adult, except that the plumage L
generally duller and the contrasts are less marked, while the tail-
feathers are definitely brown tipped with darker instead of the grey
and white of the old bird.

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
towns and in the rice fields and the swamps in flocks of hundreds,
and in smaller numbers throughout the bush. They nest in low
bushes in the most conspicuous and apparently dangerous situations,
making a typical Dove nest--a scanty collection of small sticks,
rootlets and grass most flimsily flung together. Although apparently
so reckless in their choice of nesting sites, this cannot, to judge from
their numbers, have ever had any harmful effect on the race as a
whole, and no doubt the fact that they usually select thorn bushes
(or, if not actually thorns, bushes situate in the midst of thorn
clumps) has been their saving. African thorn bush--" Them bad
prickle places " as the boys call them--is quite enough to stop idle
wanderers of all sorts, especially in the rains, when their armament
is hidden by leaves and long grass.
" Jettero " is the Mandingo name of this Dove. " Pura," the
name for all or any Doves, is often specifically used for this as being
the commonest, but " Jettero " is its proper distinctive name, and is
derived from its note, a trisyllabic " coo," which is supposed to
resemble the word " Jettero." My own boys go one better than this,
and say it is always sick and calling for medical assistance--
" Doctor-oh, doctor-oh." A white-man rendering of its call is
" Better-go-home, better-go-home "--a particularly annoying saluta-
tion to sportsmen trudging campward after an outing chiefly note-
worthy for a series of bad misses.
In general appearance and size these Doves resemble the
common cage-bird, the " Barbary," except that they are much
darker. Like it, they have the same black ring round the hinder
three-quarters of the neck, but, instead of the pale fawn of the cage-
bird, their general colour is dirt-brown above, fading into paler
buffy-brown below, until pure white is reached at the vent and under
tail-coverts. The crown, nape, throat and breast are suffused with
a delicate pale-vinous shade. The wings are brown, a slightly paler
shade of the back colour. The upper surface of the tail is grey, with
the terminal half inch or so of each feather white or whitish, except
the two central ones, which are dirt-brown like the wings and have
no white ends; the under surface is black, with broad white feather-
ends. The hill is black, the feet dull crimson, and the iris dark
brown. Length, 11 in. The young resemble the adult, except that-

The " Black Pigeons," as these birds are generally called
here, are very common in the Gambia, and numerous nearly every-
where and at all seasons, except for about the first two months
of the dry season -- middle of October to middle of December.
During the ground-nut season (Christmas onwards) they are
especially plentiful and feed largely on these nuts, which they
swallow without cracking the shell, their gizzards, I suppose,
dissolving what their comparatively weak beaks cannot break.
At other seasons they feed in the corn and rice fields, and when
nothing else is obtainable, as in the rains, on the different berries
and fruits of the bush. At the beginning of the rains -- June or
July--largish flocks appear in Bathurst, all travelling more or less
northward, and following the similar, but larger, flights of Green
Pigeons. From this time till about the end of the rains one sees
but few, and I think that a good many must leave us for this season.
At other times, however, they are strictly resident birds.
In their ordinary daily habits, too, they are among the most
regular of birds. In certain places one is practically certain of
finding them every day at one particular hour, while morning and
evening they go almost to the minute to drink at their favourite
watering-places. On these occasions one notices that they usually
pi-ecede the other smaller Doves, and are much quicker over the

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
business than they are. The bird arrives, settles on a tree--
preferably a dead one--near by, and surveys the surroundings. If
all seems well, down he comes to the water, hovers for a moment
only before alighting, and then settles and rapidly drinks his fill.
In half a minute at the outside he is satisfied and at once away.
There is no pottering about before approaching the water, taking
a peck here and a peck there, and then, when the water is a
last reached, taking a sip here and there and moving from place
to place as is the way with Ring-necked Doves. Another
interesting thing about their drinking habits is that they are
apparently quite satisfied with (if not actually fond of) brackish
water. They come down in the evening in many places to the
pools among the mangroves and certainly drink from such. At
one or two places this habit provides as good pigeon-shooting as
one wants. One place where it is particularly good is Ivafuta
Here the water in the creek is almost quite salt, rather more than
brackish, yet the " Black Pigeons " come in large numbers every
evening to drink there. The creek is fringed with tall mangroves,
and as the birds come over these, flying their very best, they give
great shooting. Another place which attracts numbers of " Black
Pigeon is a line of slightly brackish lagoons among the coastal
sand-dunes near Tujureh, and I know of others; but these two are,
I think, far and away the best, and certainly the most certain
providers of sport.
Taken altogether, our Pigeons and Doves give quite good
shooting when one can get them properly flighting. The " Black
Pigeon " under these circumstances is probably the easiest of all to
hit, as his flight is nothing like as fast as that of the smaller
Ringneck Dove, and also he generally flies straight, whereas the
latter not only goes about twice the pace, but twists and turns if
alarmed or apprehensive. The fastest of all, however, is the
migrating Turtledove, which moves like a bullet and twists like a
Snipe, but these are only to be found in a few places and on a few
days in each year. They do not, like our resident species, provide
a regular supply either of sport or food. From the latter point of
view I like the Ring-necked Dove best, and then either the Green
or the "Black Pigeon,'' bracketed equal. Sometimes I think one the

best, sometimes the other. Just before the rains the flesh of the
"Black Pigeon" is often very bitter and unpalatable, apparently
due to the fact that they are then largely feeding on " hira " fruit
--small, bitter berries of a small swamp-side tree. At other times,
however, Pigeon enters largely into the Protectorate officials' menu,
and they are pretty good evidence, as previously noted, that there is
nothing in the old saying, " A man cannot eat a Pigeon every day
for a fortnight." Very few days pass from November to June without
Pigeon (or Pigeons) appearing on the table in some form or other.
These Pigeons make the usual ramshackle pigeon-nest in
small trees and thorny shrubs, or in those places where a certain
kind of dwarf palm grows, in clefts where the leaf-stalks branch out
from the main trunk. They are usually about 12 ft. from the
ground. Two white eggs are the clutch. The nesting period, I
think, is from about March till July --that is, during the end of the
dry season -- and is well over before the heavy rains commence.
The Mandingo name of this Pigeon is " Bita-fing," from their
note, which is syllabised by them as " Biti, biti, biti-finn," and from
the colour (fing = " black "). The more imaginative among them
make a story about the call, and say that the cock is always scolding
at his wife because her extravagance is always bringing him into
court, and to their ears he says, " Lung-o-lung futa kiti, lung-o-lung
futa kiti; Talata nongkong te'mfe " (in English, " Every day the court
is ready ; by Tuesday I haven't sixpence "). This in print, I must say,
does not look very promising as a rendering of a Pigeon's note, but
pronounced (as the natives do it) in a sort of throaty whisper, it is
quite suggestive of the call, though not so actually like it as the
" Biti-fin " phrase, or as is the syllabisation which appeals most to
my ears -- " Too-too : tutta-tutt-too." In addition to this call, they
also have a shorter sort of throaty chuckle. This the natives say,
however, is that of the hen -- her laughing answer to her husband's
complaints. I do not know whether this is really so or not.

white increasing from within outwards. Sides of face and neck pale
grey washed with purplish-pink, chin almost white ; rest of under
surface slate-grey washed with pink on the chest and sides, and
becoming bluer on the belly ; under surface of wings pale grey.
Irides hazel. Eyelids and bare patch in front of eye dull crimson.
Bill dark grey. Legs purplish-red. Length 13 in.
From about April onwards a great many of the " Black
Pigeons " one gets differ considerably from the above description of
a typical Gambian example. These when on the wing look distinctly
paler than the ordinary bird, and have not any proper claim to the
epithet " black." In the hand, too, one sees that they are a much
lighter bird, in which the upper parts are a much paler grey--almost
a French grey--and the crown a bluer and brighter shade of this.
The eyelids and bare eye-patch, too, are fuller and a much brighter
crimson. At first I thought we had two distinct species here, but
now feel nearly sure that these lighter examples are the oldest, for
one often gets a bird with plumage intermediate between the dark
and light phases.
In young birds the upper parts are washed with brown, and
the feathers of nearly the whole body have broadish pale edges.
They are also distinctly smaller than the adults.
Turtle Dove ( Streptopelia turtur).
Bange: Breeds in Europe, Western Asia and North Africa . . .
also in Madeira and the Canaries. ... In winter it is found
in North and North-East Africa. (B.O.U. Hand List, 1915.)
Although the Gambia scarcely comes within the winter range,
as given above, the Turtle Dove is certainly a Gambian bird, a winter
visitor, staying with us as a rule only a few days on its northward
journey, and being most local in its haunts.
As no description of this well-known Dove is called for, a
reproduction of the notes I have on this species may take its place.
I knew this Dove in the Gambia long before I knew they were
Turtle Doves, and at one time had a wild idea they were hybrids. At
that time I had only handled one and had not recognised it, but later
on it struck me that they must be Turtle Doves. About 1910 I sent

some wings (and later a skin or two) to the British Museum, where
they were identified as young Turtle Doves.
February 11th, 1912.--Ida, South Bank Province. These
Doves are very numerous on the dry swamp near the landing-place
--nearly as plentiful here as the common Ringneck Dove. On the
wing they look larger than these, the wings and tail conspicuously
longer; the latter, too, shows much more white. Their flight is
much quicker and more dashing.
1916.--Turtle Doves are plentiful for days together at Ida,
generally about February. They provide good but difficult shooting,
as they fly very fast and anything but straight. Another place in the
South Bank where I have had good Turtle shooting is Jarreng. Here
on two or three occasions they have been coming over in flocks in the
late afternoon, all flying north and very high up. This year it was
on May 1st that I saw them, but in previous years it has been earlier
-- March or April. These Jarreng birds are all evidently definitely on
their Europe journey. At Ida, on the other hand, one finds them
resting or loitering on the road, staying for days at a time -- it may
be weeks, but my movements always prevent my staying long in any
one place. Here one sees them feeding on the ground with the
Ringneck Doves during the day, but the time for good shooting is
the evening, when they are flighting from water to roost. They
come through and over the low thorns and other scrub at a
tremendous pace, zigzagging and swerving all the time. Most
satisfactory shooting, especially if one is hitting them.
1918. -- This year I was at Ida the day they arrived, February
12th. On the 11th there were none, but during the following days
their numbers increased, though they never became as numerous as
they were last year about the same date.
I see occasional Turtles at other places, but the South Bank
Province, Ida, in February or March, and Jarreng, as passers-by
rather late in the year, are the only places where I have found them
in any number.
I have also seen occasional examples elsewhere in the Pro-
tectorate, but the chief thing about them in the Gambia is their local
distribution and their constancy as to time in their arrivals at the
places they select as rests.

Review.
April 9th, 1918.--Jappini. Quite a number of Turtles to-day
on the swamp here. Shooting " Black Pigeons this evening at the
cattle wells, I dropped a Turtle Dove, and then saw that quite a lot
were about, coming for their evening drink with the other Pigeons.
Three days before I was shooting at the same place--not a Turtle
Dove was there; I got six "Black Pigeons," and neither saw nor
shot a Turtle. They have evidently just arrived. This adds another
to the South Bank Turtle Dove places.

" A journey is a short lifetime," runs the Swahili proverb ;
and the treks described in the book now before us, in their rugged
alternations of torrid day and icy night, black rock and red sand
dune, blazing flower carpets and gaunt groves of dragon aloes, cram
the sensations of months of travel into a few short pages. The book
is full of vivid descriptions--nights spent by the tall flame of a
candle-bush fire alternate with days of blistering heat, and the long-
delayed thunderstorms transform the parched desert to a gay green-
sward, bright with gazanias and heliophilas.
Aviculturally the Ostrich dominates the book. The drawing
here reproduced vividly recalls the Sahara as we have seen it. The
giant bird-camels stand and stride in a vast landscape, under an
immense dome of sky ; the desert stretches unbroken to the illimi-
table horizon--it is the very heart of Africa, savage and desolate.
In the strong sunshine the snowy plumes of the Ostriches gleam
brightly against jet-black bodies ; one almost hears the booming of
the cock birds, or the faint yelp of some unseen Jackal.
The author writes (p. 70): " The plain to the south-west was
dotted with moving Ostriches. Singly, in twos, in threes, in tens,

they were speeding north-eastward over the desert; some on my
right, some to the left. Ever and anon one or another of the groups
halted and its members stood at gaze."
The tiny " Kapok Vogeltje," twittering on its snowball-like
nest, also appears in these pages ; we read how " the Chanting
Falcons swooped from their cliff eyries and filled the morning with
wild music "; we almost hear the cries of the Sand Grouse falling
from the night sky " like a rain of echoes." This book should
certainly be read by all -- whether professed aviculturists or not --
who wish to learn something of the avifauna of Great Bushmanland.
Turning to errors, there are no Pheasants in Africa, in spite
of the statement made on p. 210 and repeated on p. 214. In general
zoology the author is shaky. There are no true "desert Gazelles" in
South-West Africa (p. 22). The Springbok is by no means "really a
Gazelle" (p. 230), its erectile dorsal scut and molar teeth being quite
enough to distinguish it. The Gemsbok is not the only Antelope -- or
even the only Oryx Antelope -- with a reversed mane, this peculiarity
being shared by the Beisa and Fringe-eared Oryxes, to say nothing
of the Beatrix Oryx of Arabia. We do not agree that Rhinoceroses
have " disappeared " from the Bushman Desert, for we fail to see
how they can have ever lived there, since those animals must drink
every day. Surely no experienced aviculturist could confuso the
booming of a cock Ostrich with the deep-toned roar of a Lion.

Melanism in Wliydahs.
The Falls don't pour down in one great body of water as
you might think ; they are broken up by clumps of trees which
are covered with the nests of Weaver Birds. The nests hang down,
as I told you before, as if they were attached to long strings. They
sway about like flowers. I never see them without wishing that
you were here; they are so fascinating. They looked even more
graceful and beautiful hanging over the Falls than they did by the
banks of the Nzoia River on the Plateau.
On the branch of a tall tree on one bank of the Nile a big
Fish Eagle sat like a sentinel, waiting to pounce on its prey. It
caught more fish while I sat there than any fisherman we ever
watched for hours on the banks of the Thames. When it
pounced down and stretched out its wings it measured about
six feet across. Down in the swirling water there were hundreds
of fish playing about and jumping high in the air like salmon, and
glistening in the sun.
At its beginning the Nile swirls over shallows, and forms
eddies, and flows round green islands, until you lose sight of it in
the tropical jungle. I couldn't see what it did after that. You can
only walk down one side of its bank for about a mile to what is
called the Hippo Pool. Sometimes the hippos leave their pool
and take a stroll over the golf course, and invade the gardens of
the inhabitants.

Can any member tell me why birds should become melanistic

It is of frequent occurrence in birds in my aviaries,
particularly amongst various Whydahs.

years, are now jet black, having lost the yellowish patch on the
bend of the wing and all trace of the sandy edges to the wing
feathers. When moulting from the breeding dress to the " off

plumage," instead of assuming a plumage similar to that of the
females, they assume a patchy dress, several of the new feathers
being black.
Females do not appear to suffer to anything like the same
extent.
Another Whydah which has gone the same way is Pen-
thetria eqnes, which in normal breeding dress ought to have a
chestnut " shoulder patch " and a white bar on the wing. All mine
are now totally black. Coliuspasser laticauda is another bird which
shows similar changes, though not to the same extent. The red
of the head and neck is replaced by orange or yellow mottled
with black.
They are fed on native canary seed--m'wele--and are
given green food and insects when obtainable, and all are well
conditioned.
Another curious case of what is presumably melanism is
that of a Little Ground Dove --Chalcopclia chalcospilos. Normal
plumaged birds have three or four green " eye-spots " on the inner
secondaries.
Now one particular bird which I've had for two years is
metallic green over the entire upper surface from crown to upper
tail coverts. Is this melanism ? Are not metallic colours due to
refraction and reflection of light, and not to pigment?
All these birds are in outdoor aviaries.

EXECUTIVE NOTICE.
From correspondence that has reached the Hon. Secretary
and the Hon. Treasurer, we regret to learn that many members of
the Avicultural Society overlooked the announcement in the Magazine
that the subscription for the current year would be raised from 10s.
to 20s. to meet the increased cost of publication, which has been
steadily rising since the outbreak of war, and at the present time is
100 per cent, higher than it was in pre-war days.
At an emergency meeting of the Council held in October it
was found to be imperative, owing to the financial state of the
Society, to follow one of two courses : (1) Either to close down
altogether and cease publication, or (2) temporarily to double the
amount of the annual subscription. After long discussion, the
Council decided, owing to the urgency of the case and the impos-
sibility of securing a general vote of members on the question at
such short notice, to take upon itself the responsibility of increasing
the subscription, and of "carrying on," if possible, at the increased
rate. The Council felt confident that in adopting this course they
would be acting in accordance with the wishes of a great majority
of the members. It may be added that the unexpectedly sudden
cessation of hostilities encourages the hope that during 1918-19 the
cost of labour and material will gradually return to the normal.
In any case, members may feel assured that the Council will not
continue the higher subscription longer than is absolutely necessary.

Bv Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
Spots and ocellated markings in birds have obviously not been
always developed in the same way ; thus, although the ocelli in the
upper tail-coverts of Peacocks (as Darwin points out in Chapter XIY,
of his 4 Descent of Man,' pp. 655-661) have originated in twin spots,
separate in Polyplectron chinquis , hut partly confluent in P. malar -
cense, yet the remarkable ball and socket markings on the Argus
Pheasant are shown to have originated in dark stripes or rows of
spots, which run obliquely down the outer side of the shaft to the
ocelli. From Darwin&amp;apos;s illustration on pp. 663, 664, 665 and 668, I
should judge that the feathers were originally longitudinally striped,
that the stripes were broken up into spots as in Figs. 58 and 59, and
with the development of the ocelloid markings decreased in size and
finally reunited.*
Ocelli in lepidopterous insects are, I believe, more often than
not, developed from parallel undulated lines or stripes ; in the cowrie-
like markings on the wings of Brahvuea Swanzii and its close allies
every gradation is shown between the perfect shell-like and accurately
* In Fig. 60 the inner rows of spots are seen to have already partly merged into
stripes.

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
shaded spots, and the three outermost of a series of black undulated
lines which cross the disc of the wings (see my ' Lepidoptera Exotica,'
pi. xxx); the ocellus in the front wings of the butterfly genus
Mesosemia and towards the posterior angle of the hind-wings of many
of the Small Blues ( Lyccenidce) seem to have originated in the same
way; though it is possible that the black zone or iris enclosing the
pupil in these and many other groups (notably the Ringlets ( Satyrince &amp;gt;
may have originated, as Darwin suggests (p. 654), " by the colouring
matter being drawn towards a central point from a surrounding zone,
which latter is thus rendered lighter" ; but this does not explain the
central white pupil or pupils, or the sometimes variously coloured
concentric circles enclosing the iris.
Many years ago I made experiments in dyeing butterflies; in
some cases I first soaked the wings in hot water, in which I had
dissolved washing-soda ; the latter united with the somewhat greasy
pigment, so that it was washed out of most of the scales, leaving
them almost colourless ; some of the white scales, however, seem to
have been hermetically sealed instead of open at the extremities, so
that when the wings were dyed individual white scales remainedr
giving a marvellously natural appearance to these faked specimens,
even when examined through a lens. Some dealers who saw them
were much exercised in their minds as to the possibility that dis-
honest persons might, if they knew the process, pass off similarly
dyed specimens as extraordinary aberrations. Is it not possible that
these white scales may be solid throughout, not sac-like as in the
normal type, in which case the dark colouring could not affect
them ?* With regard to the concentric rings I have little doubt that
they originated from parallel lines approximate to the ocelli. In
many examples, especially among the Satyrine butterflies, some
or all of these ocelli are represented by the white pupils alone, and
in some there are gradations from the latter to the perfected eye-spot.
Central white or coloured spots in the feathers of birds have
clearly been formed by the inward expansion of the submarginal or
marginal borders. Turning to the illustration of a hybrid Grass-
finch (' Avic. Mag.,' n.s. vol. iv, October, 1906) we observe that the
* In some of the silk-moths (Saturniidce) the pupil of the ocellus is represented
by a colourless, transparent, chitinous disc.

flank-feathers are ornamented with e-shaped submarginal markings ;
in Munia punctulata these markings are thickened (extending also
backwards over the breast), so that they produce a spotted appearance;
in Amadina erythrocephala the markings have become marginal and
more regular ; in Steganopleura they retain their outline, are con-
fined to the sides of the body, but the base of the feathers is
blackened ; in the males of Taniopygia (in which they have changed
from black to cinnamon) they surround the feather, leaving only
subovate white spots; while in Bathilda, in which the sides and
breast are pale olive, they are transversely ovate and extend over
both areas, as in Munia punctulata. When flight-feathers are
spotted the result is probably obtained (as when they are barred) by
transverse outgrowth from the shaft-streak, subsequently more or less
broken up by longitudinal extension of the dark colouring, as in
Stictoptera.
Central black or dark brown spots are merely expansions of
the shaft-streak without longitudinal extension, and, of course, if the
shaft of the feather is pale it indicates at once the origin of twin
spots ; if I remember rightly some of the feathers of the Wonga-
wonga Pigeon show this character ; I was unfortunately unable to
save the skin of the bird which died in my possession.
I have already explained the probable origin of terminal pale
spots to feathers; they are usually modifications of a triangle, and,
therefore, clearly (I think) the result of the fork of the sagittate
development of the shaft-streak not being filled with dark pigment.
Why is it that wing- and tail-feathers are so frequently
many-banded, and why are the bands usually at about equal
distances apart ? I can see the necessity for this in the case of pro-
tectively barred birds, in order to render the general appearance of
the plumage uniform ; and, of course, the regularity of the banding
may have been gradually acquired through natural selection ; but I
cannot understand how it is that the coverts in the wings of our
European Jay are rendered conspicuous by precisely similar, though
brightly coloured, banding.

CURIOUS ATTITUDES OF EGRETS.

By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Mr. Astley's two small Egrets, of which he gave us such
an interesting account some time ago, as they came from South
America, would be Leucophoyx candidissima, not Garzetta garzetta,
which is an Old World bird. Although very similar in size, the two
species show a striking difference in the nuptial plumes; in the
" Snowy Egret "--as the American bird is rather absurdly called,
since all the typical Egrets are of the purest white throughout--the
crest is a bunch of thread-like " osprey " plumes, while the Old
World Little Egret has on the head only two long hackle-like
plumes, like those forming the crest of the Common Heron.
In 1916 there were a pair of candidissima at the Zoo, in the
Small Waders' Aviary, and I watched one taking its bath in a most
extraordinary way. Standing in the shallow water, it would have a
splash and then sit down on its hocks, the w T ater reaching half-way
up its body, which was perpendicular. It at the same time drew in
its neck, and drooped its head on one side, looking exactly as if over-
come by a chill or heart weakness, especially as it remained in its
queer position for an appreciable time. Presently, however, it pulled
itself together, rushed on a few paces, and then collapsed into the
dying-away position again.
Its companion seemed to think its behaviour unusual, for it
came up and had a look at it. The manoeuvre was repeated once or
twice more till the whale length of the pond had been traversed, and
the bird considered its bath finished. Was this an individual eccen-
tricity, or is this the usual procedure of this species when bathing ?
One does not get much chance of seeing, as all Herons appear to
bathe but rarely.
The Buff-backed Egret which was in this aviary recently
behaved in an equally strange manner one day. Coming to the
Zoo one Sunday morning I found it lying out flat on the piece of rock-
work at the south end of the pond, and looking so exactly like a dead
bird that when I came again in the afternoon I fully intended to
draw the keeper's attention to what I thought was the casualty; but

to my astonishment the bird was up and about and catching flies as
usual, and at the time of writing it was quite well.
I have only sOen Pne other-bird look as nearly like a dead one
as this, and that is the Cariama, which has a way of lying almost on
its hack at times, but it does not show the limp flatness of this Egret,
which was on its side--head, neck and all.
In writing of these Egrets, I have used the scientific names
given in the ' British Museum Catalogue of Birds,' but I must say
I do not agree with dividing up the typical species among different
genera as is there done. The totally white Egrets are all singu-
larly alike in general characters when in undress plumage, and
though they differ in size and in decorative details when in nuptial
dress, they all show the " osprey :;: " plumes on the hack at least, and
these are of the same highly filamentous character in all. They thus
form a very natural group or genus. An Egret is an all-white Heron
with very filamentous plumes on the back in the breeding season,
and Science is not helped, but rather hindered, by putting one species
in Garzetta, another in Lencojihoyx, and so on. It would he really
more scientific to leave them along with the coloured Herons in
Ardea, for they are all Herons anyhow, and not so distinct from the
ordinary Herons as the Bitterns and Night Herons are.
Their distinctness is not maintained, as in the case of the
Golden and Amherst Pheasants, by hostility, for in India, at any
rate, different species may be found breeding in the same colony.
Yet we do not know of their interbreeding, although all are alike in
colour, and the largest of all, Herodias, differs little in size, in its
smaller individuals, from the middle-sized Mesophoyx. Moreover, the
white and coloured forms of those less typical Egrets which are liable
to albinism interbreed freely. Colour, however, in spite of the theories
of " recognition marks " and " sexual selection,&amp;quot; seems to be com-
monly ignored by birds in their estimates of each other as comrades
or partners.
* It is, I fancy, now pretty well known that this trade terra for Egrets' plumes is
a corruption of the French " esprit."

By The Lady William Cecil
(B aroness Amherst of Hackney).
" Pleasant it was when woods were green
And winds were soft and low "
to rest in the shade and listen to the murmur of the woods, the
sweet, soft songs of the Warblers, and the " thousand and one " other
sounds of the forest world. Loud and persistent above all the music
is the tap-tap-tapping of the Woodpeckers as they hunt for insects,
or patiently drill and hammer at the excavations of their nest, or the
holes for secreting their hoards of nuts and acorns.
The Woodpeckers cannot boast of melodious voices, and
though varied, their call-notes are generally harsh and loud and
unmusical, while their love-songs are said to be the curious drumming
sound the male birds make on the stems of the trees.
In North America there are many varieties of these quaint
birds, so different from their perching, hopping, and running
neighbours ; for Woodpeckers are par excellence climbers, and are
oftenest seen on the stems or branches of trees, or flying from trunk
to trunk, though many of them feed on the ground-grubs and insects,
as well as those found on or under the bark of trees.
The Woodpecker family is a fairly numerous one, and its
members vary much in size, measuring from 6 or 7 in. to 25 in. in
length.
Among the small ones is the Downy Woodpecker (Picws
pubescens ), which is only about 6 |in. in length. He has a striped
black and white back, a broad black band on his head, and a white
line under and over the eyes ; a black and white barred tail with
black middle feathers, and at the back of the head, above the neck,
a bright red band of rather hairy feathers ; his breast is white and
slightly fluffy and huiry; his black wings are barred with white.
The Downy Woodpecker is a most friendly little bird, often
leaving the woods for hedgerow trees and gardens, and even parks
and avenues in towns. He dearly loves the orchards, and busily

drills holes in the stems of fruit trees to reach, with his barbed
tongue, the insects hidden under the bark. He seems so intent on
his work that it is often quite possible to get close to him without
in the least disturbing him, and to watch with what precision he
hits and hammers round the same spot until he has made a hole
large enough to suit his purpose, whatever it may be.
The Red-Headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) is
a good deal larger than the Downy, being some 9 in. long. He is a
much rarer bird, but one of the smartest of the family. In the
woods, orchards and gardens his conspicuous feathers and loud
tapping make him easy to follow and find, should he by chance visit
the neighbourhood. He has a black back with some white on it,
a black tail, and black wings marked with a white band; his breast
and under parts are snow-white. This description sounds colourless
enough, but the black has glossy blue lights and sheen on it,
and then he has a bright crimson head and neck, which gives him
just the right touch of colour and beauty and makes him quite
unmistakable.
How hard a pair of these Woodpeckers work to fashion a neat
round hole as the entrance to their nest, which is deep down in
some withered stump ! Scattering sawdust and chips about, inside
and outside the tree, they only seem to pause in their labours now
and then to utter their curious frog-like croaking call.
Nuts and acorns are cleverly hidden by these busy birds in
holes which they have bored in tree stems, and in crevices in the
bark. I often wonder when they begin to eat the store they have
so industriously gathered, and if they really remember in which
tree they are hidden, and if each pair of "Red-heads" knows its
own preserve.
The Yellow-bellied Woodpecker (Sphyrapicus varius) is about
half an inch smaller than the last species. He is another very
handsome bird, black and white, and a good deal shaded with yellow
on the back ; he has a bright crimson crown and throat edged with
black, and a black band round the head, with a narrow white line
round the back from eye to eye, and a broad, creamy white band
from above the bill, curving round the edge of the crimson throat-
patch to the edge of the black breast. The wings are black with

white spots, and the tail is black, with a little white on the middle
feathers. Underneath he is all pale yellow. The head and throat,
where crimson in the male, are white in the female.
This lovely bird does not, I fear, live np to the saying that
"handsome is that handsome does," for morally he is the "black
sheep" of the family, in spite of his fine feathers; for although
he devours slugs and grubs and insects in quantities and fruit in
moderation like the rest of his kind, he also enjoys a feast of the
soft inner bark of the fruit trees as well, and also the sap, of which
he is inordinately fond. His tongue is not extensile, therefore, in
order to reach the sweet juice, he will rip off the bark in great
patches, instead of boring holes as any well-conducted Woodpecker
should; and he does this "barking" of the trees to such an extent
that many are killed.
These Yellow-bellied Woodpeckers, or Sap-Suckers as they
are also called, build in holes in trees like the rest of their species,
making very deep nests. The noise of their tapping and curious
" drumming " may be heard far and wide on a summer's day. They
have a very sharp, clear call-note.
The Log-Cock, or Pileated Woodpecker (Hylotomus pileatus)
is one of the larger members of the tribe, and a very fine bird he
is, with black back and black and white wings, throat and head;
the white is sometimes tinted with a yellowish shade. The male
bird has a bright scarlet crest and a scarlet moustache. The crest of
the female is red mixed with black.
Among the big trees of the deep forests this Woodpecker
has his home. The female Woodpeckers do most of the excavating
for their nests, but the male birds help too, and the hammering is
loud and prolonged as they both work away at the making of their
nest's doorway. They often come to the ground for food. I once
watched an old mother Woodpecker teaching a young one to feed
on grubs in the ground. The parent bird buried her bill deep in
the earth and pulled out a nice fat grub, which she at once popped
into the little one's open mouth ; baby then tried to do the same,
and attempted to bury its bill in the ground, which happened to be
rather hard, and it only succeeded in penetrating a short way, and
quickly drew it out again and shook its still downy-feathered head,

pointing its little bill upwards, as if begging not to have to do it
again, as it hurt so! But for some time the stern parent continued
the severe lesson, thrusting her own bill into the earth and picking
out grubs, and insisting on the " papoose " doing likewise. Of
course it had to learn to " fend for itself," for such is the discipline
and rule of the " School of the Woods."
Far away in Louisiana, and in the swampy forests of the
South, where " Spanish moss " clothes the trees with fantastic
draperies, and the warm Hood of the " Gulf " joins the flood of
great rivers, or the long line of the Atlantic coast stretches to meet
the tropical forest, the finest of all the Woodpeckers, the Ivory-billed
Woodpecker ( Campephilus principalis), has his home. He is a big,
handsomely-marked, black and white bird, some 20 in. long, the
male having a splendid red crest and the female a black one. His
voice is clear and penetrating --three loud notes, repeated at intervals
many times.
I was fortunate enough to see one of these grand fellows
as he flew from one tall tree to another, across a flooded glade in
the forest between Pensacola and New Orleans. He flew in one
great swoop, not dropping and rising in short curves as do most
Woodpeckers. The " ivory " bill of these birds is so strong that
with it they can hammer off a piece of thick bark seven to eight
inches long with a few blows. They build in living trees, not
decayed ones like most of the Woodpeckers, and they rear two
broods in the year, the first in early spring, the second in August.
I was told that the Indians use the bills and heads of these birds as
charms, and the scales from the upper part of the bill as ornaments.
The Imperial Woodpecker ( Campephilus imperialis) is the
largest of his kind, and is said to be found in Southern California,
but this is very doubtful. He is* a Central American bird. I only
mention him as I saw a very fine stuffed specimen, which must
have measured some twenty-four inches, in a window in San
Francisco, grouped with other genuine North American birds.
Another handsome, but smaller, member of the family is
the Red-Cockaded Woodpeckdr ( Picus borealis ), inhabiting the
swamps and " barrens " of the Gulf States, his black and white
plumage showing up well against the dark Swamp pines. He has

a black crown, and the back of his neck is black; his breast white,
with black spots on the sides; black and white barred and spotted
wings and tail; his only scrap of bright colour is a vividly scarlet
line above each eye like a vermilion eyebrow.
We first made the acquaintance of the White-headed Wood-
pecker (Picus albolarvatus) in the far West, in Oregon, and
Washington State, and towards Montana eastward. He lives, too,
in the forests that clothe the Californian Mountains, and we met
him again in the Merced Yalley. He is an easily identified bird,
being nearly black with the exception of a white patch on the wings,
and a completely white head. But he has his bit of colour, too, in
a bright red band round the nape of the neck. This is wanting
in the female bird, whose " frosty pow " is white all over. This
Woodpecker measures about 9 in. in length.
The Hairy Woodpecker (Picus villosus ) is about the same
size as the last. He is a delightful person, often to be seen in the
woods of Southern Canada and the Eastern States. He is another
of the black and white birds, fairly evenly marked. He has a
black head, with a stripe all down it of rather long silky feathers
(like those of the Downy Woodpecker); a black tail with white
outer feathers, and black and white spotted wings; across the
back of the neck there is a clear red band. Madame " Hairy
Woodpecker" has no red band, and her plumage is altogether
more dull and rusty. The young birds of this species have
reddish-brown heads.
It is very amusing to watch a Hairy Woodpecker hunting
for insects on the trunk of a tree, carefully working his way up,
going round and round, till there is scarcely an inch that has not
come under the scrutiny of his sharp eyes or been tested by his
sharp bill and long tongue. Woodpeckers almost always work
upwards and spirally, they do not descend a tree head-downwards
as Tree-Creepers do.
I have watched a Hairy Woodpecker tap-tapping most
carefully and perseveringly for an hour or more, only pausing to
gobble up the insect or worm that he has scared from its " hidey-
hole " by his persistent hammering. In the spring and early summer
throughout the breeding season the Hairy Woodpeckers may always

be seen in pairs, but during the rest of the year they live apart, the
cock making a comfortable and sheltered home for himself, while his
wife has to find her own lodgings where she can. They are very
particular about their nest-making, both working at it ; the entrance
is often placed under the shelter of a branch, just where it grows
out of the trunk ; in this way the nest hole is cleverly sheltered from
wind and rain.
Among the beautiful birds of the forest the Golden-winged
Woodpecker or Flicker (Colaptes ajiratus i holds a high place. He
is rather a large bird, measuring from 12 to 13 in. His neck and
head are greyish-blue, occasionally rather darker on the crown; his
back is golden-brown, shaded with a greenish tint; at the back of
his neck is a crimson crescent-shaped band ; his breast is mauvy-
chocolate, the colour of unopened birch-buds in spring, shading off
to creamy-brown, with clear black spots all over it. There is a curved
band of black across the top of his breast, below the throat, and the
male bird has black cheek-patches. The lining of the wings and
tail are the brightest golden-yellow, which shows very conspicuously
in flight.
The Flickers may often be seen picking up grubs and insects
on the ground, several birds foraging together in small parties.
Their note is more full of changes than that of most of their kind,
and in the spring-time has a sort of Dove-like cooing tone. A
Flicker's love-making is rather Dove-like too, as he may often he
seen bowing and scraping before his lady-love in a most amusing
way. Like all Woodpeckers, Flickers nest in holes in trees. They
make several borings before they finally settle on that which is to he
the season's dwelling-place. They sometimes choose to excavate
in a rafter or post, or even in the thick rail of a " snake-fence." In
common with others of their species, these Woodpeckers lay pure
white eggs, with a smooth and shiny surface ; the clutch generally
consists of six. Flickers feed on fruits and berries as well as on
insect food ; they are not very shy, and I am sure if taken young
enough would become tame, though I doubt their living long in
captivity. They are really lovely birds, and to watch a Flicker
sitting on a leafy branch, preening his smart feathers in the sunshine
of a summer's day, is a sight to be remembered.

The Lady William Cecil.
There are a few other Flickers differing somewhat in colour,
those in the South (Southern California and Texas) having crimson
feathers where the Golden-wings are yellow, but whether these are
distinct varieties or the result of hybridity, or local food conditions
and surroundings, has not yet been clearly defined.
The Californian Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) haunts
the forests of the Rockies and California. On the "Old Wawona
trail" and thereabouts we met them just returned from their
migratory journey. They measure about 9 in. They are chiefly
black and white in colouring, the black being glossy like the feathers
of a Rook. This Woodpecker has a white stripe in front of the
eyes joining on the throat, forming a sort of " bib " under the bill;
above this bib the throat is black. In the male bird the crown is
bright crimson from the white eye-line to the nape of the neck ; in
the female a black line divides the white and red. The breast patch
in both sexes is black ; in the male a few red feathers are sometimes
found among the black. The Californian Woodpeckers have curious
white eyes. These birds feed on tree insects, and also on grubs and
caterpillars and ground insects. I saw several busily hunting for
their succulent prey among the thick undergrowth of deer-brush.
But they are chiefly renowned for their wonderfully elaborate work
of storing acorns and nuts in holes, which they bore in the trees in
the same way as the Red-headed Woodpeckers, but generally on a
much larger scale. A big tree is often spotted in large patches wflth
nuts and acorns, only a few inches apart. I have noticed several in
different places. One, a big sugar-pine in the Yosemite Valley, w T as
thickly studded with nuts, but unfortunately so high up that I could
not count them ; there must have been from twenty to thirty nuts
in quite a small space, and higher up were many more. Some
authorities say that the birds only store in this way the fruit
which contains maggots, thus insuring a supply of " animal food "
in readiness for their return from their winter in the South ; others
say that pebbles and stones are stored in the holes instead of nuts,
and that this careful work is only a mechanical " survival of a
long-forgotten necessity. Whatever the cause, the result is a very
curious habit, and it would be extremely interesting to see w 7 hat a
Californian Woodpecker would do if given the proper material of

tree-stem and nuts, and plenty of time and. space, in some large
aviary.
Another Woodpecker "out West" is Lewis's Woodpecker
(Asyndesmus torquatus), a bird about 11 in. long ; the upper parts,
wings and tail are black, shaded with the rich metallic blue, green
and bronze lustre of a Magpie's tail; a greyish collar and breast
shading to red and a red face and cheeks distinguish this bird very
easily--the red colour is rather a dark crimson, not scarlet red, as in
most of the other Woodpeckers.
We saw one of these birds in the Yosemite Valley one after-
noon, but it was difficult to see well, as it was feeding high up in
some tall pines ; and it was also very hard to follow it, for, though
the spring was far advanced, there was deep snow on the ground in
many places.
There are a few distinctly northern species, such as the
Black-backed Woodpecker ( Picoides arcticus), a rather rare bird, and
the Banded Woodpecker ( Picoides americanus ), which has a white
stripe with black-tipped feathers the whole length of its hack, some-
what like the stripe on the hack of a Hairy Woodpecker, only minus
the long feathers. A variety of this bird, with a pure white stripe
(var. dorsalis ), belongs to the Rockies. In flying they look practically
identical.
There are several more Woodpeckers, natives of North
America, which unfortunately I have not seen, or that I have only
caught sight of for a moment, so that I cannot describe them from
personal observation. Among these is Williamson's Woodpecker
(Sphyrapicus williamsonii ), one of the most beautiful, a white and
glossy black fellow with a good deal of yellow on the underparts,
and a small crimson thi'oat-patch.
The Yellow-faced Woodpecker ( Centurus aurifrons) has com-
paratively little black, and is chiefly yellow, red and white. Its
range is southwards, from Texas.
Gila's Woodpecker ( Centurus uropygialis) is peculiar to the
Colorado and Gila Valleys. There are several more, both smartly
plumaged and interesting, but whose habitat is so very limited that
their manners and customs must be studied " on the spot."
All the American Woodpeckers well repay study with field-

glass and note-book ; and in the wilder parts of the country, as every
bird-lover will realise, a very large stock of patience is also necessary,
for among the wonderful echoes of the forests and mountains the
tapping and drumming of a Woodpecker sounds sometimes in one
direction and sometimes in another in a most tantalising way, and
many difficulties may have to be overcome before the bird is found.
Among American agriculturists, fruit-growers and lumbermen
many are found who consider all Woodpeckers a nuisance, and
condemn the whole race because of their borings in timber and
fruit-trees, in buildings, telegraph and telephone poles, and such-
like places. But I believe that strictly scientific observation will
prove that only two, or perhaps three, out of the twenty Woodpeckers
of the country do any real injury to valuable crops or wood. These
" bad boys " are the Sap-Suckers, the Yellow-bellied Woodpecker
(Sphyrapicus varius ), the Red-breasted Woodpecker (S. rubra), and
perhaps Williamson&amp;apos;s Woodpecker (S. thyroideus or williamsonii).
These tear off the bark, bore deep into the trees and feed on the
.cambium, the inner hark of trees, and also on the sap, in such a
wholesale manner that the trees are riddled with deep holes, the
grain of the wood becomes distorted and knotted, and its market
value lost for ever, even if the trees attacked do not die.
The harm done by the more shallow borings (except for their
nests) of the other Woodpeckers is, on the other hand, far outweighed
by the good they do in their constant destruction of the tree-
injuring worms and insects, which are left untouched by the surface-
feeding birds.
For this reason the United States Government has put a
stop to the wholesale shooting, trapping and poisoning of Wood-
peckers of whatever variety, and the Sap-Suckers alone have to pay
the penalty of their crimes, and the harmless members of this most
interesting family are reasonably protected.

The Black Seed-finch (Melopyrrha nigra), sometimes erro-
neously called the Black Bullfinch, is a native of Cuba and is not very
frequently imported. It is somewhat smaller than our British Bull-
finch, to which its massive bill gives it some resemblance. A sketch
of this bird by Mr. Allen Silver appeared in ' Bird Notes ' in
February, 1911. The writer bred it in 1914, and published an account
in the same magazine. He w T as the first to breed it in England ; it
had, however, nested freely the previous year in Mr. Teschemaker's
aviaries, the eggs in every case proving infertile, from which I am
inclined to think that this gentleman's birds were all hens. The
sexes being alike, it is very difficult to pick out true pairs. Their
demeanour in captivity is very much like that of the Waxbills, their
movements being very sprightly and active. They spend much of
their time amongst the vegetation close to the ground. Their black
and white plumage is in striking contrast to that of most of the birds
usually kept in our aviaries, and as they are by no means backward
in coming forward when meal-worms are being handed out, they
usually attract the attention of visitors. As their name implies, they
are seed-eaters, but when feeding young they require a good deal of
live food. They are particularly fond of wasp-grubs, and are clever at
abstracting them from the comb. When the breeding season is over
mine live upon canary and millet, with the addition occasionally of a
little bread and milk. I winter them indoors, but think that they
would do equally well outside in a well-sheltered aviary.
N.B .--Since writing the above, Mr. Teschemaker has sent
me the wings of a sexed pair in which the secondaries of the male
were white almost to the extremities, whereas those of the female
were not.--W. S. B.

The storm struck the coast from a north-westerly direction,
and blew with such a uniform force that the water was driven away
from Rockport. Many fish were left floundering on the sandy
bottom, and some courageous people went out and gathered what
they wanted of the choicest speckled trout, red fish, sheep-head, red
snappers, etc. But the Pelicans showed no desire to fish. They
flew about in wild confusion, first to the shores, then across the
foaming waves into the very teeth of the storm. When there were
literally miles of bare beach where there had always been water,
the birds became even more panic-stricken than they were before.
Sometimes they would huddle together on the beach, but only for
a minute. Then with piercing shrieks they would scatter, some
waddling or half-flying up and down the beach, others trying to fly
against the wind, while some even braved the foaming waves.
As the storm increased, the Pelicans were simply blown about
like the materials from a refreshment stand when boxes of rolled
oats and packages of Uneeda biscuits chased one another towards
the water. When thoroughly exhausted, a Pelican would sometimes
spread itself out and lie flat on the sand with its head towards the
wind. While those on the shore were buffeted about at a terrible
rate, those in the water fared even worse. The waves rolled so fast
and with such irresistible force that the great birds, which are
ordinarily so sure of themselves in the water, were almost helpless.
When by an extreme effort one of them would succeed in raising its
body above the waves it was likely to he turned over and over by the
furious gale and shot into the crest of a foaming wave.
When the wind changed so that the water was driven back
towards the shore with a rush, all the Pelicans on the shore began
screaming, and it was these extreme penetrating cries from the
Pelicans and the Gulls that were being driven ahead of the gale that

drew the attention of the people to the coming wall of water. All of
the Pelicans began to run and flutter towards the higher ground, but
the fearful rolling, foaming waves caught and swallowed them in less
time than it takes to tell it. Not one was left on the shore. Some
of them could bt &amp;apos;een for a time riding the terrible billows. Others
were simply floating ; no doubt many of them were dead.
The screaming of the Gulls and the roar of the wind and
waves was intense. Just how the Gulls were able to drift ahead
of the storm so long and keep from being dashed into the waves is
hard to determine, but being lighter and able to take wing more
easily than the Pelicans they seemed to glance across the waves and
meet the air again without entirely losing control. Thus they
escaped being rolled into the waves, which were dashed together
with great force and which caused such terrible destruction to the
Pelicans. After the first dash, when the water rolled high upon
the beach, the Gulls began to roll, partly flying, walking, and being
blown along, towards the higher ground. As they reached com-
paratively high spots they veered about with their heads towards
the water and moved inland by a peculiar backing movement.
Drawing the wings together and raising the hind part of the body, a
Gull would hold its head to the ground and seemingly jump straight
up in order that the wind might carry it a few feet inland. In most
instances the head would drag on the ground something like an
anchor, and after accepting such a boost the Gull would let its body
fall down flat. In case it lost its balance and was taken up by the
wind and turned over, it would draw up its legs and contract its
wings so that when it hit the sand it would roll over and over. In
this way many of them worked their way far enough inland to avoid
the terrible crash of the debris that was brought in by the waves
after the first set had reached the shore, and the water had risen to
a point somewhat above high tide.
As the foaming waves began to deposit the wrecks of bath
houses, piers and pavilions along the beach, many water birds of
various kinds could be seen in the wreckage. Some of them were
alive ; though it seems impossible, several Gulls and Terns fluttered
out of the drifts and escaped to the shore. The waves pounded the
drifts with such force that if a bird did not escape as soon as it came

in there was no hope for it, since it would surely be crushed between
timbers.
The next morning great drifts of tangled masses of what had
been trim-limbed Cranes and pouch-mouthed Pelicans could be seen.
A few cripples were found--two great Grey Pelicans, one with his
leg broken just above the knee and the other with a broken wing ;
three Terns with broken wings, one of them having both wings
broken ; and five Gulls with broken wings. One very large Crane,
having one wing and one leg broken, was still ready to defend
himself with a spirit that deserved admiration.
A man who was marooned on one of the low islands which
was swept by waves climbed the largest tree on the island, a mere
bush, and as he was waiting, he knew not what for, he saw a Crane
nestling behind a large rock that protruded above the water.
Although he was not an ornithologist, a feeling of sympathy was
aroused, and he watched with much concern as the water became
higher and raised the Crane above the rock.
" Old fellow, I hope we'll both pull through," he said, as he
took a fresh hold with his numb hands. But the winds continued
and the water kept rising. He had to draw his legs up to keep his
feet out of the water. " I guess we'll go pretty soon. Well, here's
to you. You understand the game better than I do." The Crane
was on top of the rock now, but it was keeping its body as near the
surface of the water as possible. A flock of Gulls was driven past,
and their screams could be heard above the roar of the waves. The
Crane strained himself as if ready to try the waves. Then, with an
eager turn of the head from side to side, he plunged into the water
and allowed himself to drift before the storm. " Good-bye, old
fellow." The next morning when a boat came to the rescue, one
of the first things the man asked was, "I wonder how that old Crane
made out! "
No one witnessed the destruction of the Gallinules. A large
colony of these birds was completely exterminated. Their portion
of the island was completely swept by water, and the next afternoon
many of them drifted to shore just above the city of Corpus Christi.
With these birds that drifted in were several eggs floating unbroken
in the salt water. Why could not a Purple Gallinule, that graceful,

trim-built, active, fish-eating bird, take care of itself in a storm as
well as a Sea-gull ? An expert diver and an excellent swimmer
should be able to float. While a few live Pelicans could be found
after the storm, nobody reported seeing a live Purple Gallinule for
several days.
On one of the drifts that contained 31 dead cattle besides
the bodies of 215 birds of various kinds, there stood a solitary
Scarlet Ibis. Like a garnet in the sands, or a rosy promise of the
morning sun, it stood, gracefully poised above the terrible ruin -- an
encouragement, an inspiration, an unfailing hope--not as the rain-
bow, suggesting the possibility of another destructive force, but as
an animated symbol that life is immortal.

OF BIRDS.
By Dr. V. G. L. Van Someren.
In a letter to the Editor, p. 108, Dr. Butler mentions the
colour changes in feathers which he noted in the case of Pyromelana,
and to strengthen his argument that colouring matter can pass up
the vanes of already fully-formed feathers, he mentions the case.of
Turacus.
Now to take the last point first. In this country and Uganda
there are several species of Plantain-Eaters, all with the wide crimson
^'ing-patch, and I have in my collection of skins good series of all of
them. These birds have been collected at all times, rainy season and
dry, and not in any single instance do any of the feathers bearing
crimson show the slightest trace of this red colour being washed out
by wet. Furthermore, I have before me as I write four bottles, each
containing one crimson feather from different species of Turacus;
they have remained in water for one week and none shows any
change! These feathers were taken from dry study skins. Another
bottle contains a feather which had been plucked from one of my
tame Plantain-Eaters, Musophaga rossce. No change has taken

is a noticeable fact that those which appear to bear evfdence support-
ing Dr. Butler's statement are either--
(1) Young males changing into the breeding plumage for
the first time.
(2) Males which are obviously out of condition, and which
have not sufficient vitality in the colour glands to produce the
change.
(3) Males changing normally, i. e. red feathers are red.

Quills present!
Males of class 1 show feathers in quill which are either red,
orange or yellow, indicating a moult. Class 2 includes males with
bills far from black (though they were breeding-birds), and also with
feathers in quill practically over the whole of the body--some red,
some orange--other indications of reduced vitality being the retention
of very old worn feathers which the birds have not been able to throw
off. I refer above to birds shot in the field.
I have a large numher of captive birds in my aviaries (outdoor
and indoor, i. e. on verandahs), and these when taken up and
examined corroborate my statements above.
I have before me Dr. Butler's note on the same subject in the
' Ibis ' of July, 1916, p. 476. Dr. Butler admits that the bird under
discussion commenced its " change " rather late ; further, that it died.
One can only presume that it was ailing without actually showing it
to a marked extent, the moulting taking place slowly but not
normally, and then it died.
Dr. Butler states also that when the change takes place no
moulted feathers are found ! Do the birds not eat them ? Many of
mine do ! I give this evidence for what it is worth. I cannot at
present admit Dr. Butler's view, but I am still open to conviction on
sufficient evidence.

A MOOT QUESTION.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
All matters of interest in relation to bird-life should be freely
ventilated, and the experience of many observers brought forward
and tested in order to arrive at the truth. For this reason I have
not hesitated to express my own views touching the change of colour
in certain birds without or with only a partial moult. As a very
strong argument in favour of this view, I quoted the statement (by
not one only, but many winters) regarding the loss of colour in the
wings of the Touracous after they have been exposed to heavy rain,
and its recovery shortly afterwards, in my letter to the Editor,
published in our Magazine for 1918, p. 108.
In his ' Ornithologie Nordost Afrikas,' vol. i, p. 702, Heuglin
says: " It is known that in consequence of the extremely slight greasi-
ness of the plumage the latter absorbs much water and thus makes the
bird almost unable to fly. Moreover it has been observed in Touracous
brought alive to Europe that the red colour of the wings gets partly
washed out, which is not the case with prepared dried skins. A
Touracou shot by us during a violent thunderstorm partially lost, when
drying, the beautiful red, which changed into a dirty rusty yellow."
Then, again, the late Dr. Russ, in his ' Fremdliindischen
Stubenvogel,' vol. ii, p. 668, quotes Herr Meusel as stating : " All
lose colour when bathing, the water with most of them becoming
reddish, with others greenish"; and on p. 670 he says: "A. E.
Brehm reported in the year 1871, at the February meeting of the
German Ornithological Society, that the feathers of these birds dis-
colour. If they bathed in clear water a quantity of red colouring-
matter was dissolved in the water."
Once more Dr. Arthur Stark, in the ' Birds of South Africa,'
vol. iii, pp. 215, 216, remarks: " Perhaps the most interesting
peculiarities about this bird (which it shares with most of the other
members of the family) is the presence of a peculiar red pigment on
the wing-feathers, named by Professor Church ('Phil. Trans.,'
vol. clix, 1870, pp. 627-636, and vol. clxxxiii a, 1893, p. 511), turacin.
" This pigment is soluble to a certain extent in water and
exceedingly so in a soapy ( i.e . alkaline) solution, and it has been

A moot question.
observed by Verreaux and many others since that during heavy rains
these birds descend from the higher branches of the trees and seek
shelter in the lower and thicker undergrowth to avoid the wet, but
that, notwithstanding this, their plumage often becomes so saturated
with moisture that they are quite unable to fly and they can then be
caught with the hand. At this time the greater part of the red
colouring-matter of the wings has become washed out. The same
effect can be produced artificially by rubbing the feathers with soapy
water, when they can be reduced to a dull white or grey colour.
The bird, moreover, has the power of renewing the turacin of the
wings, and very shortly after the plumage becomes dry the colour is
as brilliant as ever. Turacin was carefully analysed by Professor
Church, and was found to contain, in addition to the usual carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, about 7 per cent, of copper--a
substance not usually found in organic compounds, and never in
such large quantities. Many suggestions have been put forward as
to whence the bird derives this metal, but it is probable that the
presence of small quantities of it in plantains, bananas and other
fruits on which these birds feed is sufficient to account for the matter
without having recourse to suppositions about their swallowing
grains of malachite and other copper ores as has been suggested."
In experiments undertaken by E. H. U. Draper (' Journ.
South African Orn. Un.,' vol. iv, p. 130), it was found that caustic
soda, 1 per cent., was the most satisfactory reagent for extracting
the colour from the feathers.
In their delightful ' Sketches of South African Bird-life,'
p. 108, Messrs. A. Ilaagner and B. H. Ivy say : " The peculiar part
of the red colouring matter of the wings is that it contains a large
amount of copper (about 7 per cent.), originally analysed by Professor
Church. A friend of ours, a chemist of the dynamite factory, con-
firmed the copper content of the feathers, hut with regard to the
theory that the red can be washed out with soap and water we are
sorry to say we cannot confirm this in toto. It certainly does get
paler during wet weather and in old skins, but we have never seen it
wash out in nature, and have tried to do so artificially with soap and
water, but without result."
(To be continued.)

Stage above stage high waving o'er the hills ;
Or to the far horizon wide diffused
A boundless, deep, immensity of shade."
Honourably wounded in the cause of freedom, Captain Beebe
returned to Guiana to resume those studies of which he wrote so
delightfully in an earlier volume.! He now gives us a second book,
designed more for the general reader, equally interesting and equally
delightful. An amusing account of steamer-travel merges gradually
into vivid descriptions of gorgeous tropical islands, finally plunging
one into the heart of the great forest of British Guiana. Captain
Beebe excels in the gift of vivid description, combined with strict
scientific accuracy : for example, he says on p. 39 :
" A long curved arm of richest green had been stretched care-
lessly out into the sea, inclosing a bay, which, from our height, looked
like a small pool, but such a pool as would grace a Dunsany tale.
It was limpid, its surface like glass and of the most exquisite turquoise.
Its inner rim was of pure white sand, a winding line hounding
turquoise water and the rich, dark green of the sloping land in a
flattened figure three. I never knew before that turquoise had a
hundred tints and shades, hut here the film nearest the sand was
unbelievably pale and translucent, then a deeper sheen overlaid the
surface, while the centre of the pool was shaded with the indescri-
bable pigment of sheer depth. In a great frame of shifting emerald
and cobalt set a shimmering blue wing of a morpho butterfly and you
can visualise this wonder scene."
It has been well said that Sir Cornwallis Harris by his famous
books first unbarred the doors of the African menagerie; equally
true is it that Wallace and Waterton, Bates and Beebe have been
the Columbuses of the Neotropical world. In the pages now before

us one fairly gasps at the profusion of bird life portrayed : one reads
with tense interest of the Vultures, like clear-cut silhouettes as they
sit hunched on the fence-posts ; of the Egrets, " like mannikins cut
from the whitest of celluloid " ; of the noisy, yelping Toucans ; of the
brilliant scarlet and yellow Woodpeckers, and the lovely Flycatchers
dressed in subdued greens and buffs ; of the droning swarms of
Humming-birds poised about the cashew trees. The book is in every
way excellent, and confirms our already high estimate of the author.
Although we advise everybody to get the book itself we cannot
refrain from one more extract:
" Close to my face, so near that it startled me for a moment,
over the curved length of a long narrow caladium leaf, there came
suddenly two brilliant lights. Steadily they moved onward, coming
up into view for all the world like two tiny head-lights of a motor-car.
They passed, and the broadside view of this great elater was still
absurdly like the profile of a miniature tonneau with the top down. I
laughingly thought to myself how perfect the illusion would be if a
red tail-light should be shown, when to my amazement a rosy red
light flashed out behind, and my bewildered eyes all but distinguished
a number." G. R.
OBITUARY.
We deeply regret to report that Sir Richard Sutton, step-son
of Mr. Astley, has died of illness in France.
We feel that all Members will join with the Council in
expressing their deep sympathy with Mr. Astley, who for so long
edited the Magazine, and who has always been so prominently asso-
ciated with the work of the Society. We all remember his unweary-
ing devotion to the best interests of avicultural journalism in the
dark days that are past.

THE PASSING OF THE SPOTTED EMU: A

I have seen tlie type-skin in the British Museum, and it is only a young Emu
of the ordinary variety.&amp;apos; - l&amp;gt;r. Le Soitef on the Spotted Emu.
On May 24th, 1859. the late Mr. A. I). Bartlett exhibited at a
meeting of the Zoological Society an Finn skin (being one of three
similar ones which had cotne under his notice) which differed markedly
from any other Emu then known to science, lie distinguished the
new bird from the common species, and in view of its minutely
spotted appearance, suggested that it should he known under the
name of Dronueus irroratus.
A few months later this zoological prize appeared in the flesh.
A living example--brought by a Dutch ship from Albany, King
George's Sound, arrived safely at the Amsterdam Zoological Gardens.
It was soon examined by the late Dr. Sclater, Secretary of the Society,
who declared that the " Spotted Emu differed from the common
iorm not only in its barred feathers but also in its more slender
build, its longer, thinner tarsi, and its longer toes. On observing
that a second bird had been sent to the Gardens at Rotterdam he
acquired it by exchange for the London Zoo, the Emu arriving in
excellent condition in the spring of 1860. Two more from the Swan

The passing of the Spotted Emu.
River were shortly added to the collection ; these, however, were
admittedly immature at this stage, being darker than the common
form.
For many years ornithologists accepted the Spotted Emu as
a valid species. At least two forms of Ostrich are known, three
species of Rhea, nine or ten Cassowaries, four Apteryxes; why,
then, should there not be two Emus ? At the time when Bartlett
and Sclaterwere describing their new find naturalists had only just
begun to realise the unsuspected richness of the struthious birds
both in species and varieties. The Spotted Emu was figured by
Joseph Wolf in a grand coloured plate which appeared in the fourth
volume of the ' Transactions of the Zoological Society.' We advise
all aviculturists to see and admire this plate.
Latterly the Spotted Emu has fallen under grave suspicion :
those aviculturists who, in Australia, have the best opportunities of
judging, reject it entirely. For ourselves, we confess that when a
few years ago we went to see in the Zoo four young Emus, one of
which, report had it, showed the characters of D. irroratus, we were
utterly unable to " spot the winner," these suspicions being confirmed
in 1915, when we again failed to distinguish a Spotted Emu from its
mates in the Edinburgh Zoological Park. Mr. Gillespie (' Avic. Mag.,'
vol. ix, April, p. 204) has expressed similar doubts regarding any
specific difference between the three Emus under his care In
Wolf's plate above-mentioned, though the iris of the spotted species
is supposed to be hazel and that of the common one reddish-brown,
there is practically no difference between them as rendered by the
lithographer. The photograph of the Spotted Emu, published by
the Zoological Society of Scotland in their Garden Guide, suggests
nothing remarkable : the slenderness of feet and figure once reckoned
of diagnostic value are probably merely due to youth.
Similarly, Dr. D. Le Souef wrote in the ' Emu ' for October,
1901 : " In the Melbourne Zoological Gardens many live specimens
from different parts of Australia have been received, including those
from North-Western Australia, and they are practically all the same.
. . . Young specimens both from New South Wales, Victoria, and
Queensland, which have their feathers distinctly barred or spotted,
have been frequently received. In some cases nearly every feather

was barred. The spotted plumage appears as they lose their down,
but at the end of the first year many of their mottled feathers, which
have got worn and ragged, are gradually shed, and new r feathers, as
a rule without bars, take their place. . . . In a clutch of young
birds from the same nest some are spotted and some are not, and
some only faintly so ; therefore I do not think D. irroratus can stand
even as a variety."
In correspondence we have received from him he adds :
" Although my article in the ' Emu &amp;apos; was written many years ago, all
my subsequent experience shows that this bird does not exist. I
have had birds from West and South Australia since I wrote."
We recollect this dialogue from a long-extinct musical comedy :
" Good old ' has been '!
Better be a ' lias-been ' than a ' never was ' ! "
Such is the epitaph of the Spotted Emu; aviculturally
speaking, it is a " never was."

NOTES ON BARRABAND'S PARRAKEETS

By The Marquis of Tavistock.
The two Polytelis Parrakeets and their ally Spathopterus (the
Princess of Wales's Parrakeet) form a small and very distinct group
among Australian birds. They have no affinity udiatever with the
Broad-tails, little with the Lorikeets, and their nearest relatives
have been considered to be the Palceornis Parrakeets of the Old
World, from which, however, they also differ in several respects.
They are not well known in captivity, nor as much prized as they
deserve to he (I except S. cilexandrce), for they are beautiful birds,
more gentle and more tolerant of close confinement than the Rosella
family, and, unhappily, not unlikely to become extinct.
Barraband's Parrakeet, or the " Green Leek " as it is called

crown; the forehead and throat are buttercup-yellow, and immediately
below the yellow of the throat is a small patch of scarlet. Scarlet
feathers also frequently appear on the thighs of the female.
Hens and young birds are of a much duller green, and the
neck, cheeks and breast have a greyish shade. The beak is small
and reddish-pink.
Barrabands are rather noisy, uttering various shrill cries,
which, however, hardly deserve to be called screeches. One of the
commonest of their calls sounds something like " Crrraow ! Crrraow ! "
The normal clutch of eggs appears to he five, but in captivity a
smaller number is often laid and only one brood is reared in a season.
The female alone incubates, and there seems to he nothing peculiar
about the nesting arrangements.
Barrabands agree well among themselves, and although I
have always separated my pairs before allowing them to go to
nest, I am not sure that the precaution is necessary. In mixed
company the " Green Leek " shows itself rather fond of worrying
weaker birds but it is not really murderous--anyhow with Parra-
keets.
Like most tropical birds, Barrabands require warmth when
first imported, hut afterwards they become quite indifferent to severe
cold. They are not difficult to tame, and make nice pets, far gentler
than the Platycerci ; although by nature exceedingly restless and
active and needing much wing exercise to ensure fertility in confine-
ment, they stand cage life well, and do not suffer in health and spirits
seen to the same extent as the Broad-tails ; no one, however, who has
this beautiful bird in the enjoyment of a good-sized aviary, or
watched its wonderful flight in a state of complete freedom, would
wish to keep it immured for life within the limits of an ordinary
Parrot cage.
When once acclimatised Barrabands are as hardy and long-
lived as any Parrakeet I know, and thrive upon the usual seed
mixture plus fruit, green food and mealworms; they are especially
fond of grapes. But they are kittle cattle to deal with during the
first twelve months of their captivity. Many, in fact most of the
hens become wholly or partially paralysed in the legs soon after
capture, while a large proportion of both sexes develop a kind of

ophthalmia. Both maladies come on quite suddenly, and none
of the remedies recommended to me by the most experienced
aviculturists and veterinary surgeons have proved of the slightest
use, even when tried for months. The best preventative is,
I think, to give plenty of fruit and sprouting oats and not much
hemp.
I have kept Barrabands for many years, and two pairs I
obtained at the dispersal of M. Pauwel's collection are still alive
and well. It is only recently, however, that I have succeeded in
breeding them. Previous to 1917 all the eggs laid were unfertile,
owing to the birds being allowed insufficient dying exercise during
the winter. Last year, however, a young bird was hatched by each
of the two pairs that went to nest and one was reared, hut
unfortunately it died the following June. This year two more
were reared, two others being accidentally crushed by the parents
owing to the nest-boxes provided being much too small.
I never ventured to risk an experiment with Barrabands at
liberty until this summer. A hen purchased in 1915 went partly
paralysed in the legs early in the spring; she could still perch
on a thick branch and cling to wire-netting, but had no power
of grasping with her hind toes and walked about on her tarsi.
Being useless for breeding, I decided, rather than destroy her, to
turn her loose on the chance of her staying and being able to get
about and enjoy life in spite of her infirmity. About the same time
I bought a cock who was fairly tame and steady, and turned him
into a garden aviary occupied by a hen Crimson-Wing, also a new
arrival. I was a little doubtful as to how the two birds would
agree as they had both been kept for some years in Parrot cages,
and the Crimson-Wing was very fond of human company. When
first introduced neither knew quite what to make of the other, and
each was a little afraid ; hut there was no hostility, and excellent
relations were maintained during the brief period they spent
together. One evening I brought the hen Barraband to the aviary
in her cage. She and the cock seemed more interested in each
other than I expected, and when I released her she flew on to the
top of the aviary. The following day she was still about, spending
nearly all her time on the aviary, and only leaving it for a tree

when alarmed. She flew strongly, and had little difficulty in
perching, or finding a more convenient resting-place when the first
branch she chose was too slender. Some days later I released the
cock just as it was beginning to get dark, my intention being that
he should go to roost at once and not have the chance of travelling
far on a full crop. He first settled on the top of his old home, but
soon became restless and swiftly took wing. How far would he go ?
As he readied the tall trees at the bottom of the garden the hen
called to him, and he swerved sharply to the right and joined her.
So far so good : he would go no further till the morning. The first
sounds that greeted me on waking next day were the shrill calls
of the Barrabands, sounding now from one part of the garden, now
from another. Occasionally I caught a glimpse of the birds darting
across the sky at a tremendous speed. The flight was powerful
and dove-like, and quite different from that of Broad-tails, or--except
when they were going slowly--from that of King-Necked Parrakeets.
After a time the hen grew tired and returned to a tree above the
aviaries, hut the cock continued to dash about like an emerald
meteor, coming down every now and then for a hasty meal on the
feeding-tray. As time went on the pair began to wander further
afield, but they have always returned regularly two or three times
a day. My chief fear in regard to them is Owls and misguided
" sportsmen," but so far they have escaped, and I hope may long
continue to do so.
One morning last week an Alexandrine and a Great-Billed
Parrakeet were sunning themselves on the top of an elm. Other
birds were similarly occupied some distance away, more than
half asleep. Suddenly a fowl, probably for some trivial cause,
broke into hysterical cackling. It is wonderful how birds from
every part of the world seem able to understand, from the very
first, each other&amp;apos;s alarm calls! With a wild and doleful clamour
the Great-bill launched himself into the air; with him went
the Alexandrine. A hundred yards away a Pennant shot, dipping
over the meadow, uncertain which way to go, until she caught
sight of the cock Barraband and decided to join him. A moment
later the Alexandrine and Great-hill picked them up and the oddly-
assorted little party circled once and disappeared, the lamentations

ash-tree the hen Barraband watched them go ; she could not be
bothered to follow her restless mate on all his excursions: he would

THE TWELVE SWIFTEST BIRDS OF
AUSTRALIA.
By E. S. Sorenson.
Kindly communicated by Mr. R. Colton from the ' Sydney Morning Herald,
May loth. 1918/
While lying on the cool grass in the delightful sunset hour of
summer days, listening to the chatter of Parrots in the gum trees
and following the rapid Might of a belated one across the bight, we
have speculated and argued as to which were the swiftest Australian
birds. In ascertaining this one had to depend mainly on the eye,
since it was not possible to get the candidates to race, like Homing
Pigeons, for the honour, nor always possible to catch an earnest
Might with a stop-watch. Thus the endless arguments on this
subject that took place in hut and camp.
From long observation we had no doubt that the Jerriang or
Little Lorikeet was the swiftest Parrot; shooters gave the palm for
speed among Waterfowl to the Pink-eared Duck, which some called
the Widgeon, and among Pigeons to the Common Bronzewing, and
it was generally conceded that the Grey Falcon (Blue Falcon or Blue
Hawk) was the champion among the birds of prey, while the
Australian Pratincole or Swallow Plover and the Australian Curlew
or Sea Curlew were the speediest of the Waders. But the Spine-tailed
Swift could challenge any of these. The speed of this bird has been
computed at 180 miles an hour--double that of the House-Swallow.
Besides its swiftness it was almost tireless of wing, being second
only in that respect to the Frigate Bird, the bird of eternal Might.
Both had very long wings in relation to the body--an indication of
rapid Might. The Swift, a bird of passage which crossed the wide
sea after breeding in Japan, w T as not known to alight in Australia,

where it spent a considerable time hunting its insect prey in the
upper air.
The Sea Curlew followed it in its annual migrations; so did
the Snipe ; both speedy birds and good stayers. This Curlew and its
lonely cry we knew little about inland, as it never left the coast;
but the Snipe came to our swamps in gladdening flocks, to mingle
with the Bed-necked Avocet and the Stilts and other marsh-haunters
that never left us. The Eagle has been credited with a speed of
140 miles an hour. Mulyan, our lordly Wedge-tail, graceful as he
was when circling on outstretched pinions, and wonderfully smart
at catching pieces of meat we threw into the air, never dazzled us
with his velocity in a straight flight from one horizon to the other.
He had a great wing spread, commonly over 7 ft., and occasionally
reaching nearly 9 ft., and he was a stayer, hut in a sprint he was no
match for the Crey Falcon. We had many kinds of predaceous birds
constantly with us, and the Crey Falcon was the swiftest of them
all. Still, he coxdd not catch the Jerriang in a sprint across the
bight, which was about a mile wide. In a long race the Falcon
would win ; so could the Little Falcon, a grevish-hlack bird, with
buff throat and white forehead, which many judges considered the
swiftest of all birds of prey. The latter, when in pursuit of a Hying
Duck, and especially when it was a little above its quarry, a position
it always manoeuvred to get, could travel at a terrific pace. It
struck with the edge of its wing with such force as often to kill the
Duck instantly, and at times even to strike the head clean off. It
was capable of overtaking and killing such a strong-winged bird as
the Sea Curlew. The handsome Black-cheeked Falcon was another
speedy member of this group and the equivalent of the European
Peregrine, the speed of which has been computed at 150 miles an
hour.

thinking about them wanting the soft food on which all Lories

My other birds have done fairly well. I have bred and reared
two nestfuls of Rosellas; I have young Red-Rumps now in the nest
--- and I hope young Browns also, but dare not look. My Peach-
Faces, who have done nothing all the summer, are now on eggs; I
have two pairs of these, also two pairs of Black-Cheeks, but no luck
with them yet. I am sorry to say I missed my chance with Pennants,
as I lost the hen of the pair which bred and reared young last year.
This was at the beginning of the season, hut though I bought another
hen it was too late for 1918. I had a very lovely pair of Kings
which nested and laid four eggs this season. These were sold to a
member, and he should breed with them next year.
I have plenty of young Green and Yellow Budgerigars, but
Blue Budgerigars are a failure. T have been trying for them, but
cannot manage it. I expect they will soon come now, as several
members have them.

*lune 1st, 1918.]
One November day while rambling through the home scrub
I heard a great commotion among the dry twigs and decaying
leaves near the river. Creeping along a ledge of hank behind
clustering hushes I found the disturbants were two male Regent
Birds engaged in deadly combat. Botli were bleeding about the
head; their lovely gold and black plumage was bedraggled and
their wings drooped with weariness. Still, they fought fiercely,
using beak and claw. A hen Regent, whose olive-brown dress was
set off with a black cap, was perched on a branch above them, an
interested and excited spectator of the duel; whilst some scrub Tits

Mr. E. S. Sorenson,
were hopping and flattering about, showing even more concern.
The rivals sprang at each other savagely, pecking and clawing,
and beating with their wings ; and now and again they hung on
and rolled on the ground, kicking and tearing at one another, and
thrashing the dead leaves. I watched them for a quarter of an
hour, by which time the tide of battle had a decided swing to one
side. I had heard that Regent Birds would fight till one was killed,
and to save the game little rival from a knock-out I rose from
behind the ledge of hank and moved towards them. As soon as
they saw me one fluttered up into the branches and stood panting,
with drooping and quivering wings, just out of reach, and the other
staggered away and crouched among the undergrowth. These birds
had a bower or playhouse not far away from the scene of the duel.
It was built mainly of sticks, and was decorated exclusively with
small shells. They built a flimsy twig nest in the same branches,
where combats between others of their kind were not infrequent
during the breeding season--November and December.
I witnessed many other bird fights about there, both in scrub
and forest; and " pugnacious birds " were sometimes a subject of
discussion amongst us. Of those that occasionally gave a sample of
their pugnacity in this rich region, the Spangled Drongo, the Greenie
or Chikoowee, the Magpie, Dollar Bird, and the Spur-winged Plover
were prominent. The Spangled Drongo was a cheeky and dominating
habitant of the dense timber--a vicious fighter, which attacked even
Crows and Hawks. Its peculiar harsh cry was heard only now and
again in the locality, for it was a bird of wandering habits--with a
range extending throughout the eastern part and the northern coast
of Australia to New Guinea. The Greenie (Chickoowee or White-
plumed Honey-Eater) was common about the place, and a general
favourite. He was one of the tamest of the family, and one of the
plainest, his coat being greyish-brown with a greenish tinge, his vest
yellowish-brown, and his only ornament the white ear plumes that
formed his distinguishing feature. He loved the gardens and the
eucalypts, living on honey and insects. An active and saucy little
chap, he bossed around with an air of general ownership; but his
loud and lively " Chick-oo-wee " was one of the cheery calls from the
near trees.

There were several quarrelsome and combative members
among the Honey-Eaters, notably the Gill Bird (Wattle Bird) and
the Tallarook or Brush Wattle Bird. The first was common among
the timber, a favourite sporting bird, easily recognised by the red
fleshy wattle at each side of the neck, somewhat resembling a pair
of ear-rings. It was particularly effective in defence with its sharp
claws, taking a tenacious and painful grip when handled. Sometimes
the Gillies assembled in thousands ; at other times the rough guttural
call of " Got to walk ! &amp;quot; was only occasionally heard. The Tallarook
(Brush Wattle Bird), a showy but smaller denizen, with no wattles,
mingled an equally curious note with the medley of voices that
greeted us in the sunny morning. Though of a bold and fightable
disposition, it was less frequently seen than its relation, as it liked a
more sheltered habitat.
The Magpie, Spur-winged Plover and the Dollar Bird, while
showing a peaceable disposition during a good part of the year, were
remarkably aggressive in the breeding season. We received startling
reminders of this in the paddock, when the sudden loud snap of
Magg ie's mandibles near our ears, or a vicious swoop of the Plover,
would apprise us that we were on forbidden ground. With the sharp
spur on either whig the Plover was capable of inflicting a severe
blow ; but it was generally the intruder's hat that was assaulted.
Often, too, the old dog that accompanied us would beat a hurried
retreat from Maggie's savage darts, his tail between his legs, and
an insulted look on his face. The Dollar Bird (Australian Holler)
furiously attacked anything that approached his home. He was one
of the show-birds of the big timber by the river side. Borne people
said his general appearance was green, some said it was blue, there
being several shades of blue and green in his elegant dress. The
inner half of his wing was light blue, the outer half dark blue, with
a conspicuous round, white patch (the dollar) in its centre; his head
and back were dark brown, throat dark blue, bill and feet red,
abdomen light green, tail dark blue, with a light bluish-greenish
band across the middle. He was a bold and active insect-eater,
whose pleasant loud call was often heard from the tree-tops not far
from the house. Sometimes he was alone, but mostly hunting with
his equally handsome mate.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
The Butcher Bird, whose home was a patch of swamp oak-
trees beyond the lagoon, was a little savage at most times, and a
bossy fellow when nesting was in progress. He was not aggressive
in the same way as the Magpie, hut more hostile towards other
birds. The midgets feared him, for he occasionally caught one and
killed it. He had his " butcher's shop," impaling his prey on
splinters, thorns, and twigs, where it was eaten at leisure or left for
future use. Sometimes two cock birds engaged in a running tight,
their strong hooked hills clipping sharply as they snapped at one
another amidst the houghs and in the air. The Sacred Kingfishers,
whose abode was in an arboreal ants' nest only 50 yards from the
door, attacked everything that encroached upon their domain. Their
pet aversion was the Goanna, at which they would dart with great
vim and determination. It didn't matter whether they were nesting
or not, they always showed fight to that egg thief. They were our
sentinels, for we always knew when a Goanna was about by the
noise they made. ::
A MOOT QUESTION.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
(Concluded from p. 04.)
Now in the above observations it is admitted that the plumage
gets paler in wet weather, and the underlined in toto seems to indicate
that a similar effect is obtained with soapy water, although the
colour is not completely washed out; hut our member, Dr. Van
Soineren goes further, and states that he has a good series of skins
" collected at all times, rainy season and dry, and not in any single
instance do any of the feathers show the slightest trace of this red
colour being washed out by wet." Well, I don't pretend to explain
why our member's experience differs so remarkably from that of
other observant ornithologists, although I do not doubt that there is
an explanation.
As regards four bottles of water, each containing one feather
taken from dried skins, I should not expect them to change, and

that plucked from a living bird would probably not change whilst in
a quiescent condition, though it might do so if the bottle were
shaken ; the steady heat of heavy rain upon feathers or the flapping
of the wings in water would he far more likely to wash out pigment
than if the feathers were merely standing still in a bottle.
I have frequently noticed, when quill-feathers have been
plucked or knocked out of the wing of a living bird, that their
proximal extremities were moist and slightly sticky ; moreover the
quill itself contained a certain quantity of serous lymph (in some
cases the tip of a torn-out quill is smeared with blood like the fang
of a freshly-extracted canine tooth), and I have seen parrots which
have acquired a depraved taste through being fed upon meat pull
out and chew the quill of a flight feather to gratify their unnatural
appetite.
On the other hand, if a moulted quill is examined it is found
to he quite dry, which seems to indicate that moult is a natural
result of the withdrawal of serum from the feathers, and that what
is known as " French moult &amp;quot; is the result of a feeble constitution
which fails to supply the feathers with needful nutrition, for I utterly
fail to see why it should he supposed that feathers, any more than
hair or teeth, could retain their attachment to the body when
deprived of vitality.
Now, when a feather becomes dry, it seems to me reasonable
to expect it to absorb a certain quantity of grease from under the
skin ; if so, this might explain, not only the slightly duller colouring
of the plumage in dead birds, hut also a more greasy condition of
pigment in moulted feathers ; so that soap, soda or ammonia might
be needed as a solvent to release the colouring in water; whereas in
a living bird whose plumage (according to Heuglin) is abnormally
free from grease, the pigment might readily he released in pure water.
Entomologists will, 1 think, admit that the wings of a living
butterfly do not speedily absorb moisture ; although it is quite pos-
sible to dye them, as 1 proved about the year 1873, by dipping the
tips of the front wings of a number of white butterflies into magenta

miserable oddity which used to trot around on the door of a large cage in the

dye (to simulate some of the African species of the genus Teracolus)
and turning them loose in my garden. After death undoubtedly the
pigment is distinctly greasy, but (as already stated in a previous
paper) it flows freely out of the scales like so much paint when the
wings are steeped in water in which soda has been dissolved. Of
course it is well known that the wings of some butterflies and many
moths after death gradually absorb grease from the body to such an
extent that they have to be soaked in benzine in order to restore
their colouring and render them fit for the cabinet.
I therefore conclude that the solvency of the pigment of living.
Touracous in clear water may vary according to the period at which
the plumage is subjected to it, and that of individual quills according
to whether they have been removed from a living bird or been
moulted out; but in any case, and in spite of our friend Dr. Van
Someren's experience, I do not think we are justified in discrediting
the statement of those naturalists who have definitely asserted that
the red pigment in the wings of Touracous is washed out during
heavy rains or when bathing and is shortly afterwards recovered.
Let me quote one or two more authorities : In his instructive
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.951271666666667">
little book, ' The Story of Bird-life,' p. 25, Mr. Bycraft says of turacin,
" In addition to the colouring matter, these feathers contain from
5 to 8 per cent, of copper, which can be extracted, Mr. Church tells

us, by soaking in a little weak ammonia and acetic acid, and filtered
off as a metallic red or blue powder. These birds lose the red colour
when washed by the rain, but regain it when dry ; moreover, this
colour is said to tint the water in which they bathe, just as is said to
be the case with the common Heron."
Once more, in ' The Ibis ' for 1900, p. 520, Messrs. It. B. and
J. D. A. Woodward say: " We noticed that the birds shot after rain
had lost much of the brilliancy of the carmine colour of the wing-
feathers ; but apparently the colour returns after the weather gets
dry again."
Well, there is my excuse for believing in the absorption of
colour by the plumage of Touracous. Now let us turn to Dr. Van
Someren's observations respecting Pyromelana. Among those which
he says appear to bear evidence supporting my statement, he men-

time. Now I really cannot see why a bird assuming its nuptial
dress for the first time, provided that it only passes through the usual
partial moult, should be regarded as exceptional ; but the statement
that the feathers are in quill, indicating a moult, in this and the other
two classes which he mentions certainly does not correspond with
my own experience or that of the late Dr. Stark and various other
field-naturalists.
With regard to what Dr. Van Someren says about my P. oryx
commencing the change rather late and dying shortly afterwards, he
has failed to observe that the time of change was not exceptional but
habitual, and that if the bird had not happened to die during the
change its transitional plumage would not have been preserved. To
assume, because the change from one plumage to the other was slow,
that the bird swallowed all the feathers which it moulted out, is
rather far-fetched; moreover, my question--" What becomes of the
moulted feathers?" in my article published in 1916 refers to the
Indigo Finch, not to the species of Pyromelana, which are admitted
to pass through a partial moult, so that one does see a few of the
small feathers dropped from the rump and flanks in order that they
may be replaced by tbe far larger, softer and more ornamental
plumes which greatly add to the charm of its nuptial dress ; but at
this season I have never come across quill-feathers, although at the
autumn moult the latter, on account of their size, are very conspicuous.
I occasionally saw one of my Hangnests, after playing with a
moulted feather for a considerable time, swallow it; but as a general
rule when it had been passed in and out of its bill, had been held
under the foot and some of the barbs torn out, it was dropped on the
floor. Of course nobody could seriously suggest that any bird would
devour the whole of its shed plumage, even if it were possible for it
to choke down its quill-feathers, and as the latter are those most
noticeable after a moult I think that point need not trouble us.
Of course my observations may have been faulty: I do not
claim infallibility any more than others ; but so many have come to
the same conclusion as myself, that I feel it to be only just that the
question should be thoroughly studied by many unbiassed workers
before it is accepted as a fact that a perfected feather is physio-
logically dead.

Review.
Moreover, in the autumn of 1896 one of my Goldfinches
moulted out with a golden instead of crimson face, and the late
Rev. H. A. Macpherson assured me that this was a common occur-
rence in captivity. Now, the moult being completed, this colouring
should have been retained if the feathers were physiologically dead;
but, as a matter of fact, it was very gradually replaced by crimson ;
just as the buff on the heads of the young Grey Cardinals slowly
assumes the scarlet hues of the adult plumage. The change of
colour in the bill develops much more rapidly in some individuals
than in others, being perhaps affected by their condition of health.
Lastly, I cannot regard the presence of sheathed feathers
scattered over the body, in birds so combative during the breeding-
season as males of Pyromelana are well known to he, as conclusive
evidence of a general moult; I should rather consider them as
replacing those which had been plucked out. Of course I may be
wrong, but why, then, have solitary males in my aviaries not exhibited
a similar condition ?

The Egyptian Government has been well advised in issuing
the pamphlet before us. Written by two members of our Society, it
gives the names--English, French, Arabic, and scientific--of the
principal species protected by law, with concise descriptions of
plumage and markings. Numerous coloured illustrations, reproduced
by the Survey of Egypt, accompany the text and add considerably to
its value. It is, indeed, fitting that this work should he connected with
our Society; for to every bird-lover aviculture is by no means limited to
the mere keeping of pets, but embraces a field that widens almost daily.
Especially are we interested in bird protection, for if all the birds
were destroyed there would be none, indeed, for our aviaries.
Even the very names given in this publication are interesting.
Some are obviously derived from the cry of the bird they designate--

as the " Fan-tailed Warbler," since this might lead to confusion with
the true Fantails of the Australian genus Rhipidura; the simple
term " Cisticola " would have been a title at once distinctive and
zoologically correct. We were glad to see mentioned the curious
habit of nesting on the tops of buildings practised by the Senegal
Stone-Curlew--one of the most unlikely of all birds, one would think,
to avail itself of such accommodation.
Although of unequal merit, the figures are in the main good-
We would specially mention the Tawny Pipit, the White-Collared
Flycatcher, the Skylark, and the Buff-backed Egrets: these are
charming examples of the illustrator's art. Very beautiful also are the
Senegal and Saharan Stone-Curlews, limned not only with exceeding
accuracy, but rendered in a delicately minute manner that suggests
the lines of a tine etching ; to us they suggested a mural decoration
on some ancient temple. On the other hand, the artist has read into
the plumage of the Lapwing too much of the brightness of the
Egyptian sky; a very dingy Little Bee-Eater gives but a poor idea
of the bird of Cleopatra, and this is the more unfortunate owing to
the skilfully-presented, quiet beauty of the Blue-cheeked Bee-Eater

It has well been said that the influence of the war has been so
far-reaching that there is not one of us whose life it has not pro-
foundly altered. The same, indeed, may be said with equal truth of
communities and societies, such as our own. The importation of
live birds has had to be severely restricted, almost to extinction ;
even the healthiest pets die in the end, and our fast-emptying
aviaries contain but a shadow of their pre-war population. There
are many of our members who have no birds at all.
This state of affairs is reflected in the Magazine. Instead of
papers exclusively devoted to the breeding and management of birds
we note a most interesting evolution. Mindful that the Society is

also wedded to the study of birds in freedom, our contributors have
sent in some valuable material under this head; others give purely
scientific articles of absorbing interest; others, again, have studied
that most important matter of all--the influence of birds on the
crops. The Magazine, in fact, like all other journals of permanent
value, has advanced with the times. " We bring the world before
you " aviculturally " far as creation's bounds extend."
This, then, is the up-to-date spirit of the new aviculture; any
other would have been as cramped and confined as the birds it
professed to study.
It is therefore with much pleasure that the Editor announces
as a novelty a number in the old style, to appear next month. All
the features, as far as possible, that appeared in pre-war days will
once more for a brief moment crowd the avicultural stage. Thus,
Lieut. Delacour will write on the Cologne Zoo after the armistice ;
Mr. Finn will give us a paper on Herons; there will be an article on
African Waxbills, and another on the chief aviary in a well-known
Zoological Garden. The correspondence column, so long closed for
urgent reasons of economy, will reappear with interesting features;
even the review will be largely avicultural. The illustrations are not
yet chosen, though it is probable that one photograph at least will
be taken from the fine collection presented to the Society by
Commander Rotch, whose work has already often appeared in the
Magazine.
Thus will the dry bones of the avicultural Dodo be once more
clothed with muscle and skin and feathers--in our March issue the
spirit of the old aviculture will live again. G. R.

HERONS.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
I should advise anyone who keeps any sort of Heron at large
to clip more than a few feathers of its wing if they want to stop its
flying. At first, at any rate, it would he advisable to cut nearly all the
secondaries of one wing as well as the primaries, though one might
leave the inner three--the so-called tertiaries--for appearances' sake.
I found that on trying to keep a common Heron in a garden, many
years ago, with only the primaries of one wing cut, it soon Hew over
the wall, using a low tree as a take-off.
Moreover, a magnificent pair of common Herons&amp;quot; they had at
Kew some years ago, pinioned, actually tried to nest on the fountain
base in the middle of the pond, to which they flew regularly, though
in a most awkward manner, looking as if they would drop into the
w&amp;apos;ater at every stroke. They ultimately disappeared, having, I believe,
flown away.
* These birds in the breeding season had the base of the beak, facial skin, and
legs bright brick-red, contrasting beautifully with the grey plumage. They
were, I believe, about ten years old. Does this mean that the common Heron
has to be very mature before it gets this final touch to its appearance ? I
have seen nothing about it in bird books.

Such large-winged birds appear in time to accommodate
themselves to the inequality artificially produced in their wings.
There used to be, and very likely still is, a pinioned Black-headed
Gull at St. James's Park which flew about freely, though it never
went away like the wild ones; and I once saw in Regent's Park a
Herring-Gull with a clipped wing practising flying on a very windy
day. It mounted to about fifty feet above the water, and then suddenly
dropped as if shot, having evidently failed to regulate its stroke ;
but its attempt gave me some idea as to how a large-winged bird,
though at first disabled from flight, can--accidentally no doubt in
the first place--regain its lost power to a sufficient extent to get
away.

My duties with the British Army having summoned me into
the part of Germany occupied by the Allies, I was able to visit the
Cologne Zoological Gardens on December 23rd last.

the starving Germans had been compelled to sacrifice their animals,
I supposed that I should see only empty cages. What was my
astonishment to still find there a very fine series of animals, and a
collection, all things considered, better, indeed, than that in Paris
or even London !
On entering one finds on the right some Pheasant aviaries
which only contain common species--Golden, Silver, Sacred, Reynaud's
--and some Pigeons ; then come, in the enclosures, Fallow Deer,
Hog Deer, Sika, and Red Deer. One of the yards bears this label:

at least a dozen Brown Bears, as many White ones, and several
other species.
The Bird House is very well appointed : one finds cages all
round. The centre is occupied by aquaria and vivaria. The collection
of Parrakeets there is remarkable. Almost all the species of
Macaw and Cockatoo are represented--amongst others, Lear's Macaw
and the Gang-gang Cockatoo (C. galeatus), and a fine pair of Po/y-
thorynchas stellatus. The Amazons, Pionus, etc., are well represented
(A. diademata, hod ini, P. menstruus, etc.). There are but few
Parrots, but there is a good pair of Cyanolysens patagonicns and a
charming Brontogenyspyrrhopterus. Further on I note a little Heron
with a most curious, enormous beak (Canchroma cochlearia ); a Dacelo
gig ant ea, a Toco Toucan, several Hornbills, a Nicobar Pigeon, a Giant
Whydah, Chinese Blue Magpies, and a number of small and medium-
sized birds. Further on I observe a couple of Goura coronata and
a couple of the rare Sclater's Goura Pigeon, and some white Sacred
Ibises.
In the centre of the house one sees a Python molurus and a
Reticulated Python, a certain number of Crocodiles, Alligators, and
Caimans; Lizards, Tortoises, Bull Frogs ; Butterflies and other
insects. In the aquaria one finds various Chancitos, some Hemi-
chromids, Chromids, etc., and young Sturgeons.
On the sheets of water the web-footed birds are not very
numerous, but belong to a variety of species. One finds Snow Geese,
Ross's Blue, Canada, and Magellanic Geese, etc., and Anseranas
melanoleuca, Bahama Ducks, Whistling and Chilian Ducks, etc.
There were at least fifty Rosy Flamingoes, and three Red Flamingoes
from Mexico which appeared to have been newly imported.
The collection of Raptores is very fine : almost all the larger
species figure in it--Eagles, Vultures, Condors, Ospreys. I call
attention to a Harpy Eagle, a Bengal Vulture, and a King Vulture.
There were also a certain number of nocturnal birds.
The big birds are a Rhea, two Emus, a Bennett Cassowary, a

great Carnivora, three Lions, three Tigers, two Jaguars, two Leopards,
a Puma, and a Black Panther. The Monkey House is well enough
filled, without containing anything of particular interest. Some
Lemurs, Skunks, Raccoons, Otters, and other small mammals occupy
numerous cages, both in and out of doors. Finally, the Zoo of
Cologne still possesses some big animals--a young Giraffe, a Hippo-
potamus, an Asiatic Elephant, an Indian Tapir, and a grand two-
horned Rhinoceros. In the same apartment one finds Zebras, some
Antelopes, and a Gnu (Catoblepas gorgon).
Let me add that all the animals are in excellent condition, and
appear very well fed. The establishment is well managed. To sum
up, the Zoological Garden of Cologne has scarcely suffered at all
from the war, and it is likely that it is the same with other German
Gardens.
It is not without bitterness that I have compared it with the
mournful ruins, the heaps of rubbish, the smashed trees, the twisted
iron-work and broken glass which represent to-day my poor garden
at Villers-Bretonneux, which was still flourishing less than a year
ago. I conclude that our public and private collections which have
been destroyed by the Germans ought to be reconstructed at their
expense.

The care of Birds of Paradise in an aviary has been, and
probably still is, regarded by many a bird-lover as a difficult problem.
They come from a country in the heart of the tropics reputed for its
deadly climate, and live in forests whose tree-tops, some 150 ft. high,
form an impenetrable screen against sunlight reaching the dense
undergrowth, in this way creating an atmosphere stifling in its heat
and vapour. It is therefore the more surprising that those species
of Birds of Paradise which have reached us here, such as the Six-
plumed, the Red, the King, the Superb, the Magnificent, and others
have with care so quickly and almost easily acclimatised themselves
to our changeable weather conditions. This year especially there

has been an exceptionally bleak and cold winter--in fact, I have
taken ice half an inch thick off their drinking pond. Night and day
bitter cold westerly winds were blowing, and do so at the present
moment, yet these birds slept in their open shelter all the time, and
in the mornings look sleek and slim and happy when other inmates
are fluffed out, resembling more a ball than a bird; they even enjoy
a bath in the ice-cold water.
When, some years ago at the end of winter, I acquired my
first Birds of Paradise, things worldly were generally more hopeful,
and one felt justified in granting oneself a little extra cash for such
pleasures. I felt very concerned at the time as to suitable housing
for them, but decided eventually, and made ready for their reception
my most sheltered aviary, 20 ft. by 60 ft., thickly planted out with
shrubs and with just an open shed behind. This shed we filled with
big branches, screening the open part thickly half way down, so that
the inside was dark and cosy and yet open. I cannot say that in
those early days this new acquisition was an unmixed joy. The
pleasure of possessing these rare and expensive birds was much
tempered with the anxiety as to how they would take to their new
abode. Each morning one scanned the ground in fear lest one of
these gorgeous birds had " gone before ! After a week, however, I
felt that my birds would be all right. Meanwhile, I had a look at
those in the Sydney Zoo, purchased at the same time. They had
been placed in an open aviary, and several mornings I saw them
crouched cold and shivering against the wire. They were being
" hardened off." That a number did survive shows how very hardy
these birds must be. From the commencement of keeping them I
tried to get my birds used to eating dry food, that is to say, rich cake
with plenty of eggs and butter--we can allow ourselves that luxury
out here even now--mixed with crushed hemp-seed. Besides, I
give them the best of fruit--not refuse--such as bananas, apples and
pears, whichever is in season, allowing them to have the fruit whole,
not cut up as in the Zoo here ; then, especially during summer-time,
it won't deteriorate and get sour so quickly, causing gastric troubles
and death to the birds. During the warmer period they got as a
luxury crickets, grasshoppers, locusts, and--what they like best---
white grubs out of the ground or decayed wood, the larvae of various

species of beetles. I noticed that whereas other birds will kill these
insects first, especially such as have nippers or pincers like the grubs,
the Birds of Paradise just grab them with their powerful claws, and
--they are remarkably sharp !--holding them down with one foot, will
eat them right away. It is remarkable how systematically they
proceed to dismember the locusts, or cicadas rather, always the same
way, commencing with the pulling off of the wings ; then come the
legs in rotation, and then the head last. It is strange that even
whilst being pulled to pieces these locusts will sing. To have small
birds in the same aviary is certain to court murder, for the Birds of
Paradise are great cannibals : even the little King, the gem of all I
know, is not above stealing eggs and young out of the nests of
smaller birds. This King Bird of Paradise is a great mimic. He
often delights to give the note of the Butcher Birds, followed by a
warning call which sends all the birds inside and those near, outside
the aviaries, under shelter. He has quite a repertoire of calls, some
not unpleasant, and his voice, like that of the Bed Bird, is heard
often and far off. He is certainly my favourite, and the most
interesting and liveliest of those Birds of Paradise I know. When
the moult commenced during September-October I noticed my
Birds of Paradise becoming very tame--a young Magnificent
especially so--as Soft-Bills have a habit of doing before or when
they get " light." I caught it out, and placing it in a large cage by
itself I set all the dainties I thought it would delight in before it.
Alas, a few days later the bird died--I admit through my ignorance
---but I had learnt my lesson, and when the others behaved in a like
manner I realised that they asked for more live food, which I now
supplied in additional mealworms. Some would eat forty to sixty
and more per day. They soon improved, and as their moult pro-
gressed so of themselves left off eating mealworms. Just now in
full colour, they hardly touch them. I might mention that young
cock Birds of Paradise have the plumage of the adult hens and
are hard to distinguish from the hens, hut once in plume they
always retain the characteristics of the male, dropping their " show "
plumes only. I understand from Mr. Ward that it takes three
years before the Red Bird gets the two streamers, and only in the
fourth shows the red plumes, which then, year by year, improve. I

verified this fact myself. Unfortunately in this bird the beautiful
orange head-feathers on the freshly-caught bird become after the
first moult in captivity a very pale und sickly yellow ; the same
applies to the shield at the back of the neck of the Magnificent. If
one only knew how to keep the orange tint in the feathers or the red
as in the Sepoy Finch, Scarlet Tanager, Red Robin, etc. ! Strange
to say, the King Bird retains that lovely velvety maroon-red colour.
What is the cause? What is the remedy?
The flight of the Birds of Paradise is the characteristic one of
all scrub birds, accompanied by a kind of rattling noise--the Quail
and Partridge species make the same sound when flushed. It is
astonishing how these birds love the rain. The sun will not draw
them out of their shelter into the open ; the rain does so every time :
even the Superb, the most shy and therefore most unsatisfactory of
the lot, will come out for a drenching, spreading out and displaying
his beautiful plumes. At times in the morning the Red Bird and the
Six-Wired will come out to bask in the sun, the former perching on a
branch with head back between the shoulders, the wings and plumes
well spread as we used to see them poised on ladies' hats. The only
one, however, that will dance in captivity is, it seems, the Six-Wired
species. I have seen the King Bird raise his two tail plumes Lyre
Bird fashion, puffing out and drooping the wings like a ducky hen,
giving a peculiar call at the same time, which leads me to believe
that this display is a love dance for the edification of the hen. That
these birds will breed in captivity given suitable conditions I am
convinced. I have seen the Six-Wired carrying sticks, and a pair of
Red Birds in the possession of Mr. De Berri-Waxman here also
appeared to be anxious to nest, the cock bird carrying sticks and
becoming very spiteful. Unfortunately, shortly after, the cock bird
died suddenly and without apparent cause. My King Bird is very
anxious for a mate, to judge by certain calls and his behaviour. My
Birds of Paradise are all males. One would like to make the experi-
ment, even at the high cost of the birds, but there are certain
restrictions in force here regarding keeping them, one being that their
dead bodies must be handed back to the Government authorities and
others--so one does not care to make the effort. For exhibition
purposes in Zoos or even privately Birds of Paradise are not satisfac-

tory at all, excepting, perhaps, the Red or the Blue Bird of Paradise.
These seem to come out into the open much more than the others.
Even Mr. Ward, with his wide experience, says that he has never
seen a King Bird of Paradise in freedom. They must have long
flights and thick scrub aviaries for shelter. I am sure that, however
large a cage may be, if they are kept like Canaries they will not live
very long. They must have shelter : however little is given they
make the best of it. As to keeping them otherwise, as I do, I can
only say that I wished all my Soft-Bills would do as well.
I have asked Mr. Ward, who is again returning to New
Guinea, to try and get some information as to the nesting of the
various species of the Birds of Paradise, and I may be able to impart
some information on that point later on. Then some enthusiast at
home will perhaps make the experiment of trying to breed one or
the other species.

By W. Shore Baily.
This handsome Serin does not seem to he very often
imported, and when it does come over is frequently met in true
pairs. Coming as it does from the cold regions of the Himalaya, this
species is admirably suited for our aviaries, the variable English
climate having no ill-effect upon it. A pair bred with me last
season--being the first time in this country, I believe. They built
rather a neat little nest of dead grass, moss, and hair. Three eggs
were laid--bluish-white, with a few brown spots chiefly at the
larger end. The little ones spent rather a long time in the nest, and
I did not notice them on the wing until eighteen days later. As far
as I could see they lived entirely upon seed, both parents feeding
them after the first few days. When they had left the nest the
cock took the principal charge of them, and a very good father he
made. It was a pretty sight to see the young ones chasing their
father around and around their large flight. The young ones were

brownish-grey, heavily striated on back and breast with a darker
shade of the same colour. They are now, at five months old,
beginning to show the colour areas of their parents. In 1914 I
reared a rather handsome hybrid from one of my hens, by an
English Greenfinch Cock, and exhibited it successfully at the London
Cage-Bird Show. I obtained my two pairs from four different
sources, and always under the name of Sikhim Siskins, and until
recently had always thought that these and the Himalayan were one
species. This spring Mr. Tescheinaker, who lias bred S. tibetana
freely for the last two seasons, asked me to exchange a pair of young
birds with him, which of course I was pleased to do. On the arrival
of his birds I at once noticed the difference, and on looking up
' Bird Notes ' I found that both varieties were described in the
volume for 1914. There appears to be nearly an inch difference in
size, S. spinoides being the larger ; this bird also lias a yellow rump,
which S. tibetana has not. The female of the latter species is also
described as being more or less striated with brown, whereas the
female of S. spinoides only differs from the male by being paler in
colour. The young Siskins were very much darker than the Himalayan
youngsters, the hen especially showing very little yellow as compared
with the cock. Both species are very desirable aviary birds.

In these days of empty aviaries and restricted importation the
newly decorated flying-cage in the Manchester Zoological Gardens is
of exceptional interest.
This aviary, which has been in existence for many years, is
situated in an ante-room of the Lion House; it has long sheltered a
series of Doves, Weavers, Budgerigars, and various other birds.
There is ample flying space; a service passage at the hack gives
access to the interior; there are large seed-boxes for food, and water
is supplied by two stone fountains. The perching accommodation

Dr. Graham Benshaw,
was formerly provided by large spreading branches, in which the
Weavers used to construct their nests ; now the branches are shorter,
though sufficient--presumably so as not to interfere with the new
background that has been painted in.
This recent decoration is at once novel and striking; painted
by the master hand of Mr. B. E. Holding, the effect is excellent. In
the Zoological Park at New York it has long been the custom to
furnish scenes from actual bird-haunts as backgrounds for the cages.
Over here Manchester leads the way in mural decoration, the aviary
at Belle Vue being the only instance of its kind in the country. Mr.
Holding has depicted a mighty African river flowing between wide
banks, to disappear in a broad waterfall. On the horizon we discern
a range of purple mountains, while in the foreground are seen many
feathered fowl. Weavers and Whydahs, Mousebirds and Bee-eaters
fly over the scrub or perch on branches ; great black and white Horn-
bills are here, with Sacred Ibis and Egyptian Geese. Touracoes sit
silent yet alert on a convenient bough ; close by a trio of Shrike please
the eye with their blue and white plumage. In the foreground we
recognise the familiar figure of the Masked Dove {AHna capensis );
by the water-side stands a Francolin and the pretty, historic Crocodile
Plover. Conspicuous in the scheme is the White-bellied Grow, with-
out which no African landscape would be complete.
On the right wall the Ornis of Australia is depicted in similarly
suitable surroundings. The African birds are replaced by great
Pelicans, a Bifie Bird, and the Australian "Magpie" ( Gymnorhina ).
We see the Laughing Jackass emitting its raucous notes, and there
is the Wonga Pigeon and the curious Maned Goose. The left wall
transports us to America, with its Curassows and Hangnests; a
Toucan yelps industriously, while a Yellow-fronted Amazon sits
phlegmatically on its perch unmoved by the clamour.
The lower portion of the background is occupied by a wired-in
service passage, skilfully subdued by white painted wirework, which,
by dazzling the eye, masks all detail. The front wires of the aviary,
on the other hand, are rendered as inconspicuous as possible by a
coat of black. The stone fountains are of simple and pleasing design :
the upper shallow basin is smaller than the lower, and both allow
ready bathing and drinking facilities. Many of the birds in this

aviary were in excellent condition, no doubt attributable to the
generous space allowed for exercise. Among the exhibits we noticed
Budgerigars, Cockatiels, a Conure, a Californian Quail, an Australian
Crested Pigeon, a Blue and Yellow Macaw, a Blue and Red Macaw,
a bright green Love-bird, a Song Thrush, a Saffron Finch, and a large
yellow Weaver. There was a good series of Psittacines in the Lion
House annexes, and we noticed besides some Macaws, the Greater
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Leadheater's Cockatoo, Pennent's Parra-
keet, Senegal Parrots, Black-headed Carque, and some Amazons.
In this building there is a long-tailed Glossy Starling, which
shows no sign of age though it has been several years in the
collection.
In another part of the gardens there is an ideal installation for
water birds. It consists of a circular well-grassed island, with a tiny
shrubbery at the top, which serves as a wind-screen. There are five
well-grown trees, including two weeping willows. The moat running
round the island is wide enough to allow plenty of swimming exercise,
and the whole is encircled with a neat, low railing. At present the ^
tenants are Demoiselle Cranes and a Flamingo. In the summer the
bright red plumage of the Flamingo made a beautiful and striking
picture, set off by the green grass and a vivid blue sky. Swans have
also been kept in this enclosure, where they are seen to great
advantage.
Not far off is the Ostrich House, a wooden structure with two
paddocks, containing an Emu and a very tame cock Rhea, which
feeds from the hand. The Pheasantry is divided into several out-
door flights, each with an inner apartment, and contains Swinhoe
and Silver Pheasants; also a Gold-Amherst cross, Peafowl, and a
Crowned Crane. One compartment is reserved for Cormorants, whose
blooming plumage shows them to he in the best of health. The
Cabypbara shares his enclosure with an Egyptian Goose, and in the
Waders' Aviary are Sarus and White-necked Cranes, a Violet Gallinule,
and Sea-Gulls.
Other interesting birds in the collection are a pair of Indian
Blue Magpies, very smart with their black heads and necks, azure
blue backs, long blue tails, and orange bills and feet. Alert and very
wide awake, they utter curious metallic, half-piping notes, flying

easily from branch to branch, or descending earthwards with
bounding hops.
The Black American Vulture is here, its sooty plumage
showing lines in it, like black watered silk ; also a Buzzard--like a
miniature Eagle--its brown plumage glossed with purple in the sun-
light. Here we see the half vulturine Caracara from Brazil, and a
large Horned Owl.
In conclusion we mention the Condor, which has lived many
years in the Gardens; the Golden Eagle; the Bald Eagle from
America--Uncle Sam's bird of freedom ; the scraggy, untidy-looking
Pondicherry Vultures; the beautiful Curassow, with its blue-black
plumage and intelligent eye, a Pheasant of the New World; the
common Crowned Crane, perhaps the original of the fabled Phoenix;
and the lovely Wood Storks, black and white and pink. Even more
beautiful is the snow-white Egret, its spotless purity set off by the
pale green eye and cere, and black legs and feet. There are two
Marabout Storks: one squats on his tarsus, bis head and neck retracted
between his shoulders; the other stands upright with wings neatly
folded, like some philosophic, very correct old gentleman wrapped in
a long tail-coat. The Black Stork in the collection is a nice bird.
Though much smaller than the familiar white species, he is very
choice, with his plumage shot with changeable purple-bronze, like the
feathers of a Bird of Paradise. Last of all there is a solemn old
Pelican, with plumage agreeably tinted with salmon colour, and a
pale green pouch under his red-tipped beak.
We would recommend all our readers to visit this collection at
least once ; indeed several hours can be profitably spent in avicultural
study at these well-stocked and long-established Gardens.

St. Helena Waxbills. Since I had them I have put them in a small
aviary made from a part of a conservatory, size about 7 ft. 6 in. high,
5 ft. back to front by 5 ft. wide. The end and back are brickwork,
the front wood 3 ft. high and glass, and roof glass, with a wire-
netting front on the inside of the conservatory and a tiled floor.
The position faces north ; access, from conservatory to drawing-room
(where mostly I have a fire every evening), is by casement doors.
The birds have nesting-boxes, which I think they use at
night. Since I had the birds I found one cock Cordon Bleu on
the aviary floor unable to fly. I took it out, " warmed " it up, and
in a day or two it was all right again. This was about six weeks
ago, and the bird is still well. I found recently the Fire-Finch and
St. Helena Waxbill both dead on the aviary floor. There are now
in the aviary 3 cocks and 1 hen Cordon Bleus, 1 Orange-breasted
and 1 Common Waxbill (both cocks), 1 hen and 1 cock Zebra, 1 cock
Longtail, 1 cock Fawn and White Bengalese. I do not think the
birds I found dead were killed, as they all seem fairly friendly
together.
I should like an opinion as to the probability of my keeping
particnlarh/ the Cordon Bleus and Waxbills in this aviary during
the winter.
I could heat the place during the severest weather by an
electric radiator, but owing to fuel restrictions could not do
anything more.
I could keep the Cordon Bleus and Waxbills in a cage indoors
in a room where fires would mostly be, but I do not wish to do
this unless it is absolutely necessary.
The Cordon Bleus are good birds, and I am desirous of keeping
them for breeding in the spring if possible.
I might add that this year is my first with any birds, and
I am\ery inexperienced. But I am extremely fond of my feathered
pets, and anxious to do the best I can for them.
I should have said, perhaps, that the food I give is millet
spray, Indian and white millet seed and canary seed, cuttle-fish
bone--crushed and in lump; ordinary sand and bird-sand are given,
I think, in sufficient quantities.

the spring, there would have been a better chance for them to have
become acclimatised. The change from a warm living-room to a
cold conservatory is necessarily very trying to delicate African
Waxbills ; and African Fire-Finches are of all the most delicate--
indeed, I was never able to keep them at all. Common and
St. Helena Waxbills were not as a rule long-lived birds with me,
and freshly imported Cordon Bleus were extremely delicate, though
when once acclimatised they lived to a good age. I should certainly
advise you to give the birds the benefit of the electric radiator,
at any rate for this winter. If gradually accustomed to a low
temperature, it is wonderful what even delicate Waxbills will stand,
but sudden changes are frequently fatal. I have known the Orange-
breasted Waxbill to live in an unheated outdoor aviary from one
year's end to another, but doubtless it was first turned out at
the end of the spring or in early summer. Your feeding is quite
correct."]
FINCH HYBRIDS.
By Allen Silver.
I am at present investigating cases of hybrids between Twite
and Redpoll, Goldfinch and Twite, and Chaffinch and Canary. We
have heard of many of the latter, but there has always been a
mistake. I am going to see owner, who seems extra sure, but expect
it is another case of a mixed collection.
I report having here a Twite and Goldfinch hybrid. Twite
predominates extraordinarily. Bill much like that of Citril Finch,
i. e. Goldfinch-like; hardly any green, except on rump; probably a
hen; tarsi black as in Twite. I saw later the Twite-Goldies
moulted. No blaze; wings buttoned as in Goldfinch, and white
webs of Twite wing-feathers suffused with pale yellow. Both crosses
are perfectly genuine. Green is evidently subservient to brown in
hybrid admixture. The lineal markings which are absent in one
parent are well developed in both crosses. The Twite seems to
minimise the shape and size of the hill immensely.

By E. S. Sorenson.
[Kindly communicated by Mr. R. Colton from the ' Sydney Morning Herald,&amp;apos;
May 15th, 1918.}
(Concluded from /&amp;gt;. 74.)
The Jerriang (Little Lorikeet), which so often flashed over-
head in screeching flocks, was the smallest as well as the swiftest
Australian Parrot. This green mite, with the red face and black
wings, was easily picked out from the several other kinds that fed
in the same trees, their common food being principally the honey of
the eucalyptus--though occasionally they attacked fruit and grain.
The Musk Lorikeet (Green Keet or Green Leek) associated with it,
and was another rapid flyer. You would hear the screech of a flock
overhead, and in an instant they were gone. The Green Keet, as it
was generally called, was a couple of inches more in length than
the Jerriang. When one was cut off from its mates it sailed after
them like a streak of green lightning. The Swift Parrot (called also
Bed-shouldered Parrot and Swift-flying Lorikeet) was another com-
panion. It was the biggest of the three, and when Hying was
distinguished from the others by the red colour under the wings.
When these three started together in a flight across the clear
paddock, as we were sometimes lucky to get them, the Jerriang
won, with the Green Keet a close second. Redwings, however,
were not so much with us as the Keets, nor were their kind in such
numbers.
The two Bronzewing Pigeons were prized by game-hunters.
Both were strong and rapid flyers. The Brush Bronzewing was
slightly smaller than its cousin, and it was a rarer and shyer bird.
We frequently found it feeding along the edge of the plantation and
outside the river scrub, into which it would disappear with a
whirring sound on being disturbed. We had many Pigeons in
those scrubs. The little Green Pigeon was always with us. As it
kept to the thick brushes its flight was not easy to gauge. The
Fruit Pigeons came in season, and the Wonga was in the scrubby
hills not far away. The Common Bronzewing was the swiftest.

It was a fine plump bird of nomadic habits, sometimes called a

for it drank about sundown, and its flight consequently directed him
to water.

The railway to Moscow has required very little engineering
skill in building; with the exception of a few bridges there is
nothing of moment; occasional farm-houses and villages are seen as
the train rushes eastward, then a deserted moated grange is passed,
then forests, chiefly of silver birch, but not of large growth, pine-
woods occasionally; in one place a Fox was startled by the sound
of the train. A dense forest was seen, to which a Wolf was skulking
home; a lagoon came in sight, in which the silent Stork was watch-
ing for its prey. As the day advanced, a few beautiful Cross-bills
were seen perched upon the telegraph wires ; they took no notice of
us as we passed. There seemed very little bird-life, except the Grey
and Black Rook,&amp;apos; ;: which in Russia to a great extent takes the place
of our black one. Mole-hills we saw everywhere, and one of the
travellers averred that they were of a different shape from those in
England.
In the summer the people start very early for market, going
together in numbers as mutual protection ; and very gay and well
dressed they look. The congregating together is a survival of the
time when Wolves in some numbers frequented the land near the
forest; Wolves even now attack isolated parties at the approach of
winter.

VULTURES.
By A. Blayney Percival.
[Reprinted from the 'Journal of the East Africa and Uganda Natural History
Society.']
In a real game reserve the sick animals are killed before they
have time to die, for there is little doubt that the scent left by a sick
beast would be at once recognised by such animals as live on the dead
and dying.
\ ultures are possibly the quickest to spot the sick animal, and
alight near to wait for its death, thus acting as guides to the four-
footed scavengers, who all make for the spot where they see the
\ ultures dropping. Taking this into consideration, it can be easily
seen that the only occasions on which disease in game is recognised
is when an epidemic breaks out.
The gathering of the scavengers--" those who come for the
broken meat "--is a most wonderful sight.
If an animal dies in the open, it is only a case of minutes
before the first Vulture appears. A few minutes later the air is full
of them, and then the four-footed scavengers begin to appear--the
jackals first, usually in pairs. In an out-of-the-way district, or game
reserve, where the sportsman is rare, they come openly trotting up,
showing little fear; and if the Vultures are not too numerous they

will at once attack the carcass. If the Vultures are in large numbers
they will not venture near, but will sit and await their chance of a
tit-bit, or wait until only the bones are left, and then they will take
what remains. Possibly an old hyaena, very hungry, will be tempted
to move in daylight, but his slinking approach is very different from
that of the jackal: he seems to feel that he is a creature of the night,
for he comes along, taking all the cover he can, till he sees the feast,
when he will hurry up to it, and, driving off the Vultures, set to
work ; even then he is very nervous, and constantly looks round for
a possible enemy. Should he manage to get a large piece of meat,
he will even retire to the nearest cover with it; one can see it is
against his instincts to be abroad in the daytime.
The quick arrival of the Vultures on the scene is explained by
the way in which they quarter the skies so high that the human eye
cannot see them ; yet with their No. 12 Zeiss-power eyesight they
can see all that goes on over a big area. The sick or wounded buck
is seen by one Vulture, and he drops towards it. From north, south,
east and west other birds sail in towards the same point, and so the
circle spreads until hundreds of birds are at the kill. The collection
of hyaenas at the feast must work out something on the same lines.
Every hyaena has its own regular round, which is followed night after
night, and, as he travels, his howl notifies His neighbours as to his
movements. Should he find a kill his howls cease, and I have no
doubt that this is quite enough to bid his friends to the feast.
This is, of course, if a kill is fresh. If a kill is a day or two
old, which only happens when a beast has died in thick bush, and
out of sight of the Vultures, it will of its own accord notify everything
down wind for a big distance ; or the track of a sick or wounded beast
will attract every meat-eater that crosses it.

with the hen ; several nests were built and fertile eggs laid, but the
little ones were always abandoned by their parents four or five
days after being hatched ! Once I hoped to obtain a success at
last. The birds fed the young ones as well as possible ; I supplied
them with soft food of the usual kind, soaked millet and plenty of
live ants' egg. But about the twelfth day after hatching the parents
seemed so restless that I feared the young were dead. I looked
in the nest and found it empty. Searching about the aviary, I
discovered two bodies already in pin-feather. Another nest was
constructed. But I gave over the hope of rearing any young this

THE PIGEONS OF THE GAMBIA.

These brightly-coloured, graceful Doves are in the Gambia
essentially village birds ; they frequent the yards and the immediate
vicinity of towns and villages, finding most of their food at the corn-
beating places and rubbish heaps, and getting their water from the
water-jars and coolers in which it is kept. From this they get their
Mandingo name, " Dumbokango Pura," which means " Jar-rim Dove '
--a much more appropriate name (as far as Gambia is concerned at any
rate) than " Palm Dove, as they are so commonly called in dealers'
advertisements, etc.
Their nests are nearly always in the thatch of huts or the fiat-
roofed grass shelters (" kwiangs "), in which we all live as much as
possible. Sometimes, however, they lay in the forks of large trees,
and occasionally select smaller ones, such as oranges or limes, in

which they then make the ordinary flimsy platform which suffices
for so many Doves. In every case, however, the breeding takes place
in the immediate neighbourhood of man and his dwellings, and in
most places, as the guests of the community, they enjoy absolute
immunity from pillaging boys.
One hardly ever sees any number together : they are practi-
cally always in pairs, and are seemingly among the most constant of
mates. They have two distinct notes--one a coo, the other a sort of
chuckle.
In size they are rather smaller and slimmer than the Ring-
neck Dove--104 in. as against 11 in. The plumage is greyish-pink
above, washed in places with chestnut; the flights are dull brown,
the wing-coverts rufous internally, grey externally. The upper tail-
coverts are dark grey ; the two central tail-feathers are very dark
grey, almost black, the others paler grey and tipped with white,
these white tips being larger on the under surface than on the upper.
The chin, throat and upper breast are vinous, and round the sides
and front of the neck is a collar of bifid black feathers which are
tipped with reddish-mauve. The lower chest and sides are slaty-
blue, fading into v T hite on the belly and under tail-coverts. The above
refers to the male ; the female is similar, but the colours are duller
and the pattern less distinct. In the young they are still more so,
the greater part of the plumage being more or less washed with
brown.
The irides are brown, the eyelids dull red in the adult, grey
just tinged with reddish in younger birds. The bill slate tinged with
purplish, the legs dark red.

found on the wings. There are two distinct races of this Dove, both
of which inhabit West Africa, and in one the wing spots are green,
in the other blue. In the first, the green-spotted (T. chalcospilos),
the spots are described as metallic golden-green, but even these are
not at all suggestive of an emerald, while in the other race (T. afra
afro) the spots are dark metallic blue--sapphires perhaps--hut not)
having the remotest resemblance to any green gem. All the birds I
have handled in the Gambia have had blue (not green) spots. The
epithet " emerald," too, can only cause confusion between this species
and the " Emerald- " or " Green-winged Doves " ( Chalcophaps) of the
East.
They are common throughout the Gambia, where they are
commonly seen in pairs in the hush, and are much more birds of
the uncleared parts than of the cultivated areas round the towns.
They spend much of their time on the ground, where they obtain
their food, mostly grass-seeds and the like, hut roost in hushes and
low, thick trees. They are very tame, and usually will not rise till
one is close to them, when they get up with a loud, very partridge-
like wing-whirr, and fly off with a rapid, darting flight, and a flash of
rufous red as they spread their wings. Their note is a quadrisyllabic
" coo," which is commonly translated into the words " Better-go-
home, better-go-home "--a very accurate rendering, hut one which can
be very irritating when one is coming home after an evening with the
gun which has been chiefly marked by a series of had misses.
These Doves are easily caught and do well in captivity.
Description. --Length, in. ; tail, comparatively short. The
whole crown clear blue-grey, the forehead, lores and chin white
shading into the grey of the crown. Rest of upper surface a rather
mealy grey-brown, crossed on the rump with two bars of much darker
(sepia) brown. The wing-coverts like the back, some of the postero-
internal ones marked with one or two circular, dark metallic blue
spots. The flights are above burnt-sienna brown, the outer two
having sepia outer webs; in the next three (about) the edges of the
outer webs and the ends are sepia, but the remaining feathers are
only tipped with this colour. The lower tier of the primary coverts
are burnt-sienna (like the flights) and tipped and edged with sepia.

each feather being tipped with sepia. The upper tail-coverts are

The tail has the upper surface bluish-grey broadly tipped with
black, except the central pair of rectrices, which are dark grey-brown
tipped with black, and the outer pair (one on each side) in which the
proximal halves of the outer webs are white. The under-surface of
the tail is black, the outer feather on each side being marked as above

This well-known, long-tailed small Dove is common in the
Gambia, though not all are permanent residents, for during the rainy
season one sees comparatively few r about. Prom November to June
they are plentiful, and are found either in pairs or (at the beginning
of the season) in small parties--one cock and two or three hens.
They frequent the open country, especially the cleared, cultivated
fields round the towns, and find their food (millet-grains, grass and
other seeds) on the ground. Here they walk, or rather run, about
very rapidly, w'hile in the air their flight is very fast and arrow T -like--
in fact when on the wing they look like big arrow r -heads. They are
not easily caught, but do very well in captivity, and have been bred,
but with confinement all their sprightliness disappears and they
become dull, over-greedy birds, disinclined to move except to the
food-tray.
The Mandingo name is " Moro Pura," the " Mahomedan
Dove."

the back pale brown with two dark brown bands separated by a

tail feathers are black with grey bases. The lower breast and belly
are white, the under tail-coverts black, as is the angle of the wing,
and the under wing-coverts are brown. The iris is brown, the bill is

Dr. Millet-Horsin,
each, which is quite dear enough. The two birds at this time were
quite naked. Mine. Chede fed them on cooked rice and bread and
milk. Very greedy, they soon became quite tame. After some time
they began fighting and had to be separated ; the weaker was put
into a large cage with Weavers and Pigeons, which never molested
it, while it was always quite peaceably disposed towards them.
The other bird, the larger, is the one which was given to me.
Like its brother, on August 12th it already had its shape and all its
feathers ; only the great quills of the wings and tail still remained
ensheathed, and were but two-thirds of their full length. I put it
into the aviary with the Ked-billed Hornbill, Glossy Starling and
Parrakeet; none of them made any unfriendly demonstration. It
settled itself in a corner of the cage, with the body vertical and the
knees drawn up, the tail perpendicular along the whole length of the
back, and the beak horizontal, shaking the head with a slow gesture
of negation. It accurately reproduced the appearance of a pitcher in
the form of a bird, and recalled the aspect of a seated Egyptain deity.
From time to time it cleaned itself, carefully preening its plumage,
and especially the tail. When I approached it, it came hopping
towards me, with half-open beak, uttering a strangled cry exactly
like that of a young Crow. If I gave it my finger it swallowed it
without ceasing its cries. I fed it with small native tomatoes, bread
and Duquesne&amp;apos;s paste; it did not merely eat, but took at once food
offered from the hand--there was no need to cram it. When I gave
it live butterflies it tried to catch them. It could not fly, but jumped
up to a perch 20 cm. from the ground ; one must, however, admit
that it maintained its position with difficulty.
From the following day it began to feed itself. I had taken it
out of its cage to feed it on rice cooked with sugar ; I had put several
live grasshoppers into the cage, and had by me five or six dead ones,
which I did not want to give it all at once. The rice did not suit
my new pensioner, who rejected it. A half-killed grasshopper began
to move, and in a moment my bird escaped me, seized the grass-
hopper, threw it into the air, caught it again and swallowed it, then
ate others, all by himself. From this moment he ate the food of
his companions ; he soon developed marked skill in catching live
grasshoppers and butterflies. He then desisted; not being very

active he often rested without movement on his perch. At the end
of six or eight days he climbed all over his cage, and tried his wings.
When resting he often uttered, almost ceaselessly, a " Tia-tia, tia-tia,"
which was audible quite a long way off; he never failed to salute my
arrival by his hoarse cry, like that of a young Crow. I never saw him
fight the other birds.
T left him on August 27th to return to hospital, and found
him on September 22nd fully developed, Hying about his cage in
perfect health.
At this date Adjutant Chede agreed to give me the young
Hornhill which remained with him. It was perfectly tame; they
had clipped its wings and it was left at semi-liberty, contenting itself
with returning at night. As it had always been hand-fed, and had
never been seen to feed itself, people thought it did not know how to
do so ; moreover, he screamed in the presence of food, so that it was
decided to give him the morsel, and he never touched it of his own
accord. But on September 22nd, at six o'clock at night, when they
wished me to put him back, he could not be found. They called ; he
answered " Tia-tia, tia-tia " ; he was perched in the middle of a
papaw tree. I took him and demonstrated that his stomach was
very full, though his owners had had no time to attend to him since
noon. The droppings, which T kept, showed that he had been feeding
on grasshoppers, which he had taken in the bush, for his wanderings
occasionally took him far enough. In spite of their former quarrels
the two brothers did not recommence fighting ; the new arrival easily
accommodated himself to the existing regime.
Their transportation took place without incident. However,
the two birds arrived in Paris with the tail quills so damaged that I
was obliged to pull them out to allow them to grow again more
rapidly. I had similarly supervised the development of the wing
quills of the new arrival, whose first owner, one remembers, had
clipped them for him.
In the menagerie of the museum they from the very first
showed a great affection for their keeper. The new arrival, with its
wings cut, could not stand the dampness of the ground, and died on
November 20th following. The first bird died in December.

At the beginning of this year, as soon as the February sun
had brought hack cheerfulness among the birds, I noticed that the
cock Melba Finch, which I had vainly sought to pair with a hen
Aurora Finch the year before, courted the hen Cordon-Bleu. I then
had many opportunities of admiring his remarkable flute song--
almost as pure and beautiful as that of the Violet-ear. By-and-by
a nest was built--the spherical nest of all Waxbills--and eggs were
laid and incubated, but they proved clear. Another attempt at
nesting met with no success, the nest having been destroyed by
other birds.
Towards the end of last May, being busy in this aviary, I
perceived the peeping note of young chicks coming from a Harz
nest-box hung high up near the ceiling of the shelter. Some minutes
after the Melba Finch flew out of the nest; I thus recognised the
parents of the new-born young.
They carefully fed their nestlings, using soft food, unripe
grass-seeds, ants' eggs and small insects collected round the tender
shoots of rose-bushes; and a fortnight later on entering the aviary,
I saw, to my great joy, some fine hybrids sunning themselves on
the twig of a little shrub. There were three, resembling the young
Crimson-eared Waxbills, but bigger and of a larger size, with a
stronger black bill and the typical light-blue warts on each side of it.
There was not any trace of blue on the breast, but only around the
bill. The rump and upper tail-coverts were dull reddish-brown,
the feet and tarsus flesh-brownish. The fledglings fed by themselves
two weeks after leaving their little cradle.
Meanwhile the Melba Finch repaired the nest with some
feathers and the hen began again to lay eggs. Both sat upon them
alternately, and I noticed how steadily the cock did so, and took
care of the chicks later on. Indeed, I wonder that this species,
which seems so apt at breeding, has not yet successfully reproduced
in captivity--for, as far as I know, it has not done so, not even

in Germany. However, I read some years ago in the ' Gefiederte
Welt ' an article by the well-known aviculturist, Herr Hugo Dicker,
of Halle, where he reports that the Melba Finches he possessed in
his bird-room gave him nothing else but clear eggs; he mentions
in the same article that he reared many Red-faced Waxbills and
Aurora Finch hybrids, which always died befoi'e they could feed
themselves. He noticed what a good father the Pytelia afra was,
and I have observed the same qualities in his near relative-- P. melba
(' Gef. Welt,' 1910).
This second brood gave me four more hybrids as fine and
hardy as their elder brothers.
In October a third brood was unfortunately destroyed by
mice, which penetrated into the nest-box, and threw away the little
ones when five or six days old.
These hybrids sing very often, and beautifully ; their song
resembles that of the Melba Finch, though perhaps it is a little less
melodious. They are magnificent, when adult, at about the age of
thi&amp;apos;ee months. The following is the description of the adult:
Wings and hack olivaceous yellow, not so bright as the
father's; tail-feathers red-brown broadly edged with blood-red, the
two centre feathers blood-red throughout; upper tail-coverts and
rump blood-red ; head, nape, sides of neck dull slate-grey; forehead,
cheeks and face scarlet: throat and breast of the same colour
shaded with purple, with more or less violet reflections according to
the incidence of light; a dull blue-grey line separates the breast from
the abdomen, which is light-huffish ; under tail-coverts light-buffish ;
flanks dull blue-grey marked with white spots; iris brown; eye-lid
fleshy-pink: hill coral-red, paler at base. The bird has the elegant
shape of the Crimson-eared Waxbill, hut resembles its father in size.

have found its way very frequently into our members' aviaries, or
we should probably have heard more about it. The cock is a
handsome bird, his white cheeks contrasting in a pleasing way
with his black head and breast and chestnut-coloured back; the
hen is not so richly coloured. To see them at their best they
should be kept in a large grass-covered aviary, containing not too
many shrubs and trees. My birds spend a good deal of their time
perched on a heap of faggots, but I think that they generally roost
on the ground at night. When disturbed they take to the trees,
as did my Indian Skylarks, and when singing the cock usually
selects the highest perch he can find. They are not nearly such
good vocalists as the Indian Lark, which is a really fine singer.
They appear to he very hardy, as they have been in a very exposed
enclosure all this winter, witli the temperature at times close on
zero. Two other species of Finch Larks are found in South Africa,
P. verticalis and P. australis, and we are told by Major Perreau
that there are several of these Larks in India. They are very
desirable birds, and should be well worth importing. My pair
nested in Dr. Amsler's aviaries in 1914, but did not bring off any
young. They made no attempt to do so with me last season.

No African landscape can be considered complete without a
group of these birds, and they are frequently to be seen in the
greenest part of the country. Observing them for the first time,
pasturing after the fashion of a flock of Geese, the stranger might
easily believe that he heheld a herd of black or white cattle, according
as the heads or tails were turned towards him. Many a time have I
seen a solitary coal-black cock, looming as large as an ox, standing
phlegmatically by himself, in the most exposed situation, the sun s
rays pouring perpendicularly upon his bald pate, but he appearing
most enviably regardless of the heat, drought and desolation that
surrounded him. Of the many wild scenes exhibited by Nature there

is none wilder than a fleet of these giant birds crowding all sail,
their towering masts raking gallantly, with every stitch of canvas
bellying to the breeze, as, like ships of the desert, they are bearing
down for some point in the ocean-like expanse.
The man who seeks to improve his acquaintance with the
desert-loving Ostrich will presently discover why it was that she was
created with a long neck. Like many other wary animals, she will
often suffer a waggon to approach very close before taking the alarm ;
but, generally speaking, her great range of vision renders approach
within moderate shot impossible otherwise than upon horseback.
Herding in troops of thirty, forty or more individuals of both sexes,
these giant birds inhabit the most sterile and desolate regions, com-
monly associating with Burchell's Zebra, and uniformly frequenting
the widest and most'naked plains, where their towering heads are as
far elevated above their four-footed companions, and above the
surrounding country, as to admit of their discovering objects at a
distance which renders them secure against the stealthy invasion
of man.
During the breeding season the South African Ostrich
associates himself with several females, which deposit their huge eggs
in one common nest, if we may so term a shallow cavity simply
scooped in the sand. No attempt at concealment is made, nor is the
smallest particle of any kind of material employed, the eggs being
nevertheless surrounded by a shallow embankment, and thus pre-
vented from rolling away. The ground colour of the egg is pure
white marbled with clear yellow, and the number found in one place
has been known to exceed sixty, the hens continuing to lay during
the whole period of incubation. The chicks are about the size of a
pullet, and walk the moment they are out of the shell.

Lieut. Gurney, Mr. Seth-Smith, and Mr. Pocock. Letters of regret
for non-attendance were received from Miss Chawner, Mr. Shore
Baily, and Mr. Willford.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
It was decided, in view of the cost of production, to delegate to the
Editor the entire correcting of proofs. By this ordinance, there-
fore, no MS. accepted for the Magazine is reissued to contributors
or others for revision prior to final setting-up in type. In this way
the Council trusts to effect economy in the make-up of the Magazine.
In view of the necessity of strictly limiting the expenditure,
a proposal to issue special sheets of advertisements on coloured
paper in the Magazine was negatived, as was also a suggestion to
recommence publication of coloured plates.
The Chairman drew attention to the gratifying notice of the
work of the Society published in a recent number of ' The Ibis.'
Special attention had been drawn to Mr. Low's unique photograph
of a runping Apteryx. The same gentleman's remarkable photograph
of a colony of nesting Puffins, published in the July ' Avicultural '
under the title of " The Birth of a Nation," was also noticed.
Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake was nominated to fill a vacancy on the

" The hand, wearied all day with grasping the rifle, is not
the best suited for wielding tbe pen." So wrote Roualeyn Gordon
Gumming, when in 1850 he published his famous book of South
African travel, from notes taken in the wilderness. Yet such rough
journalism, translated into literature, delighted generation after
generation of readers, and formed a notable accession to romantic
natural history. What Cumming and his fellow-hunters did for

the ancient writer we murmur, " Say not the former times were
better than these," for the book now before us, in its enchanting and
minutely accurate descriptions, should rank as a permanent classic
of zoology.
Some books of travel are cumbrous, utterly uninteresting,
wearisomely prolix; but the present volume is not one of these.
Vivid description is the keynote of every page of this pleasant
record, interesting alike to those of us who have seen something
of Africa, and also to those who have not. Arrived safely at
Mombasa, we pass through the choking red dust of the Tarn desert
to the rolling grassland alive with Ostrich and Zebra; thence to
prosperous Nairobi with its stone buildings, and to Lake Nakuru
sheeted with blue lotus lilies. There are pages on Zanzibar, Tanga
and Dar-es-Salaam. The second part of the book deals with hunting
experiences among big game; the third part is miscellaneous, and
the fourth consists of an account of fishing in the Protectorate,
by the late F. G. Afialo. Interwoven into the book are several
passages which will delight the aviculturist. Take, for example, the
description of Vultures assembling at a kill (p. 252):
" First a speck in the blue, which seems to fall with ever-
increasing velocity; then other specks appearing with incredible
speed from every point of the compass, until the air above the kill
is darkened with the spread of wings. They drop to earth, and
stand around in a circle, or perch in the boughs of neighbouring
trees if there be any close enough. They are of all sorts and sizes.
The Vultures are dignified and sedate, quietly but keenly expectant
of the moment of your departure, but the small fry, such as Kites,
Kestrels and the like form a shrieking, tumultuous mass, around
which the Marabouts pace solemnly as though on guard. Above
there are others, and yet others constantly converging to the spot.
You move off and there is a rush and a tumult of sound--the
flapping of wings, chattering of harsh voices, clashing of beaks.
You look back, and there is a black, struggling heap. A minute or
two, and the flapping and rushing of wings begins afresh. The
birds of prey are once more mounting to their airy look-out."
There are notes on Guinea-fowl, on Herons and Storks and
Marabouts, on Parrots, on Weavers, and on Touracoes; the bell-like

note of a Fruit Crow is described, together with the gurgling "water-
bottle " performance of the Bush Coucal; an interesting photograph
of a wild Ostrich's nest is included in the book. The illustrations
are nearly all good, printed two on a page, and worthy of the
letterpress. The entire work is in very truth a breath from
the veldt.
The book contains few errors; it must, however, be pointed
out that the Impala is not a " Red Deer " (p. 32) but an Antelope;
in spite of the statement on p. 236, "Deer innumerable" do not
occur in East Africa--nor indeed any Deer at all; the popular
name of the Touraco is Lourie, not "Dourie"; the Hammer-Head
should not be called the " Hammer-Headed Stork " (p. 211), for it
is in a class by itself, being as much Heron as Stork, and practically
an annectant form uniting the two. The phrase "great untidy bird "
is exaggerated when applied to a species no bigger than a small
Heron. G. R.

To-day we await with interest the completion of his monograph on
mound-building birds. A third has written from the depths of his
great knowledge many books and papers on matters ornithological-
scientific, scholarly, practical--linking aviculture delightfully with
journalism, whether he writes of ornithological oddities, of fancy
Pheasants, or of the care of rare Water-fowl. A fourth is an
acknowledged authority on Parrakeets. Others, again, are known for
brilliant work on foreign Finches, for nature study in the African
bush, or for research among Mammalia. By the courtesy of our
contemporaries their own published pages are free to our columns,
from the embryology of the Ostrich to the habits of the Albatrosses

Nothing in this world stands still ; as the old proverb has it,
not to go forwards is to go back. The dawn of peace gives oppor-

aviculture, modified and transformed in many ways by the long war,
moulded and remoulded by forces beyond the control of any of us,
embodying all that was best in the old system, yet with new
characters of its own.

typical of each department of the Society's activities, illustrating

THE HISTORY OF BIRDS' NESTS.
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
Has any ornithologist ever heard of a fossil bird's nest or even
egg? I never have,* but, oddly enough, some years ago when
gardening I picked a smallish heavy stone out of the earth, so
perfectly oval in form that it might well pass for a fossil egg, and J
kept it as a puzzling curiosity. Having, therefore, no positive
evidence of the existence of prehistoric nests, one is thrown back
upon imagination and probability. I regard a lively imagination as
an important acquisition ; it may open the way to deductive reasoning
and so help to explain long-hidden truth.
As man in his early days was content to live in caves and
burrows, there seems no reason for supposing that prehistoric birds
had acquired a superior condition of intelligence, and I can quite
imagine that Archceopteryx may have deposited its eggs in holes in
partly-decayed trees, that Ichthyomis, like our Razorbills, Guillemots
and Auks, made use of depressions or crevices in rocks, and that
Ilesperornis, a relative of the Divers and Grebes, not having attained
to the proficiency of the latter group as an architect, was content
I don't suppose the eggs of JEpyornis would be considered even semi-fossilised.

(like the somewhat similarly paddle-winged Penguins of our time)
to utilise a depression or burrow in the sand as a site for its eggs.
Fragile eggs lying on rock with no resilient material beneath
them would be very liable to be crushed, so that only the stronger
examples and those best formed to resist pressure would survive :
this may perhaps explain the thickness of shell and form of some of
those placed in such situations; then, again, chips of more or less
pointed wood in the hollows of trees might bruise or pierce delicate
shells, which may account for the hardness and polish of the eggs of
Woodpeckers and others.
Probably the earliest attempt to form a support for its eggs
is exemplified in the case of the Rock-dove, which lays upon a few
stalks or straws placed upon a ledge in the cave which it selects for
its habitation ; its relatives who inhabit trees have advanced a trifle
further, making platforms, of greater or less strength according to
their species, in the forked branches of trees or bushes; some other
groups (as, for instance, the Touracous) have not advanced any
further in nest-construction.
In platforms made of twigs or straws there must always be
more or less defined crevices or openings ; and, to prevent eggs
falling through the wider of these, they must necessarily be calked
in the centre with rootlets, grasses, leaves, or earth ;thus, even at
this early stage of development, one sees some of the materials in
use which are utilised in more advanced structures. When a plat-
form is constructed in the centre of a many-branched fork, it naturally
tends to become depressed in the middle, thus becoming vaguely
saucer-shaped, and this I imagine was the first step towards the
prevalent cup-like nests of the present time.
The increased stability and safety of eggs deposited in a
saucer-shaped as compared with a level platform would probably
encourage the builder to improve upon this type of nest by building
up the outer margin so as still further to safeguard its contents
during rough weather. As I have pointed out elsewhere, the con-
struction of most cup-shaped nests is a very simple process. The
parent bird first accumulates a quantity of twigs, straw, bents or
* In my experience the Wood-pigeon generally uses rootlets, which tend to bind
the twigs composing the platform firmly together.

whatever other material she requires as the foundation, in the fork
of a tree or shrub, in a hole in a bank, or whatever other site she
may have selected. She next proceeds to collect, one at a time,
pliant sticks, bents, etc., with which, holding one end in her beak,
she hops round the foundation. When the nest is in a forked branch
the material thus becomes enlaced and held in place by the divergent
twigs round which it is carried, and as soon as the walls thus formed
have attained a strength which appeals to the builder, she tucks in
loose ends and then flies off to seek material for the lining ; the
latter is brought to the nest a little at a time, until it sometimes
rises above the level of the walls, and then the hen squats down
upon it and turns round and round, at the same time scratching with
her claws ; by this means the soft mass is compressed and felted,
and nothing remains to be done excepting to add an inner lining of
hair or fine fibre, and (if the bird has testhetic tastes) a little
ornamentation of the outside walls.
But many cup-shaped nests are not half so elaborate in
construction, and this is especially true of birds which build in holes
in the ground or in banks, sucb as Larks or Wagtails, which often
merely collect a mass of dry bents and mould them into a cup by
sitting in the middle and turning round. I have made as good nests in
half a minute by taking a bandful of hay in one hand and squeezing
my other fist with a rotary movement into its centre, nor have the
birds I made them for disdained to sit in them.
The most ffirasy-looking, though one of the strongest, of cup-
sbaped nests is the beautifully-netted receptacle constructed by the
species of Sporophila, of which Hudson observes: " So light is the
little basket-nest that it may be placed on the open hand and blown
away with the breath like a straw, yet so strong that a man can
suspend his weight from it without pulling it to pieces." Why did
not he say that St. Paul's Cathedral might be suspended from it ?
There is no humour in exaggeration which is not extreme, and,
mind you, Sporophila forms its nests of fine fibrous roots or horse-
hair; in my bird-room fine willow-fibre (used for filling grates in
summer) was employed. How did birds learn to net and plait ?
* Itobins, Nightingales, Meadow-pipits and some others, when they utilise such
sites build far more finished nests.

122 The history of birds&amp;apos; nests.
Was the tucking in of loose ends the first step towards this
accomplishment ?
The building up of the sides of a cup-shaped nest was probably
the first step towards the construction of over-arched nests, in which
only a comparatively small opening is left in front, this over-arching
being due to an effort to protect the parents, eggs and young against
inclement weather, the fall of undesirable matter into the nest and
attacks from above ; the addition of a tube leading into the opening
was almost certainly a later development, since it is frequently
wanting in nests built by captive birds.
In the case of some birds which nest in holes where the
opening is so wide as to be a source of danger to the occupants, as,
for instance, in that of the Nuthatches, the entrance is filled up with
clay, leaving only a small aperture for the entrance of the parents.
The Hornbills go even farther, for the hen is imprisoned by a resinous
secretion commingled with woody particles (before the period of
incubation and for two or three w 7 eeks after the hatching of the
young), a slit only being left in front through which the male bird
feeds her. The origination of this kind of defence does not require
any great intellectual development, since we note analogous means
adopted for protection by the larvae of some insects, as, for instance,
those of the Psychid moths* and Caddis-flies ( Phrygctneidce ).
When caves became insufficiently numerous to house our savage
ancestors, or when they migrated from the vicinity of such shelters,
it became necessary for them either to burrow in the sides of hills
or construct huts of clay: with birds in all probability a similar
course was adopted. This would account for the solid nests built
by the Oven-birds of the New World and the Pied Grallina of
Australia, as well as by the numerous birds which inhabit burrows.
In the Swallows we find both types, those species which construct
the outer walls of their nests of mud or clay being, I should judge,
more advanced intellectually than the burrowing species, since
Trap-door Spiders, with their marvellous silk-lined burrows closed
at the entrance by a hinged and bevel-edged lid, show far more
intelligence.
* I think the popular name for these in English is Gipsy, but in America they are
called Bag-worms.

The necessity of State action for protection of wild birds. 123
It would be difficult to decide which group of birds has attained
to the highest rank as nest-builders--whether the Magpies' retreat,
barricaded by its thorny, basket-like covering, or the pensile nests of
some Starlings, should be awarded the prize ; but we know that both
the Crows and Starlings are very clever, though undoubtedly, as
with human beings, their brain-power is not equally developed in all
the species.

Carnegie Fellow, and Research Fellow of the University of St. Andrews.
It is now generally agreed that birds as a class are highly
beneficial, and function as an important natural force in the control
of the many insects that attack agricultural crops, fruit orchards and
forests. Realising this many countries have enacted laws for their
protection and preservation, whilst some maintain departments
wherein their feeding habits, migrations, increase and decrease, and
general movements are studied, with great benefit to their respective
nations.
The question is frequently asked, " Why should the State
interfere with wild life ; why should not birds and all other wild
animals be left alone ? "
In order to give an adequate reply to this question it is
necessary to consider at some length the activities of wild animals
and their relationship to mankind.
The nation or^the individual who possesses objects of great
value seeks by ail legitimate means in their power to preserve such
from wanton destruction or harm in any sense. Such action is
highly commendable, for surely it is only right that anything that
is conducive to the welfare of mankind, and that we of the present
generation have the privilege of enjoying, should, if possible, be
handed down for the benefit and enjoyment of generations to come.
It is the duty of the State, therefore, to guard and conserve most

Dr. Walter E. Collinge,
jealously every object that tends to the uplifting and advancement
of its people, irrespective of whether such objects possess any direct
utilitarian value or not.
In the case of wild birds we have both an aesthetic and a
utilitarian value attached to them. On the former we do not
propose to dwell at any great length, for the love of wild birds
is interwoven with our national life. In painting, statuary, poetry
and prose this is at once evident. We have associated with bird
life purity, valour, fidelity, the love of freedom, and the exalting love
of maternity. We have used the bird as the emblem of peace and
contentment, and to express the idea of grace and symmetry of form
and of perfect adaptation to the environment. The song of birds--
the "thousand blended notes" as Wordsworth described it--has
inspired the poets of all ages and countries, those of our own country
being not the least. Some of the stateliest lines in English poetry
refer to birds, as readers of Shakespeare, Shelley, Scott, Burns, Gray,
Longfellow and Tennyson will recall. The study of bird-life has ever
exercised an ennobling influence, in consequence of which in certain
countries efforts have been made to make it a compulsory provision
of the education code to arrange for the study of birds in the public
schools, and in a modified form to the original proposition one of the
States of North America has enacted a law requiring every teacher
in the public schools " to give oral instruction, at least once a month,
. . . relative to the preservation of song-birds, fish and game."
Legislation of this kind undoubtedly marks the commencement of
a phase in the public mind that is likely to assume greater importance
in the near future. As a recent writer states: " The systematic
study of birds develops both the observational faculties and the
analytical qualities of the mind. The study of the living bird afield
is rejuvenating to both mind and body. The outdoor use of eye,
ear and limb necessitated by field-work tends to fit both the body
and mind of the student for the practical work of life, for it develops
both members and faculties. It brings one into contact with nature
--out into the sunlight, where balmy airs stir the whispering pines
or fresh breezes ripple the blue water." Very similar ideas are
expressed by Forbush, who writes: " There is no purer joy in life
than that which may come to all who, rising in the dusk of early

morning, welcome the approach of day with all its bird voices.
The nature-lover who listens to the song of the Wood Thrush at
dawn--an anthem of calm, serene, spiritual joy sounding through
the dim woods--hears it with feelings akin to those of the devotee
whose being is thrilled by the grand and sacred music of the
sanctuary. And he who, in the still forest at evening, harkens to
the exquisite notes of the Hermit--that voice of Nature, expressing
in sweet cadences her pathos and her ineffable mystery--experiences
amid the falling shades of night emotions which must humble, chasten
and purify even the most upright and virtuous of men."
On the utility of birds we might dwell at great length and
then be far from exhausting the subject. Few of us have formed
any conception of the influence they exercise upon our food-supply
and many products of industry. Here we must strictly confine our
remarks to their value as the guardians of our crops, our orchards
and our forests. How little do we realise what a potent factor for
good wild birds are in this connection, what the sum total of their
ceaseless activities means, and how intimately associated it is with
the security of our food supply! Were it not for the benefits con-
ferred by wild birds it would be impossible to successfully cultivate
the majority of our crops. This statement may seem an extravagant
one, but an examination of a few instances will at once serve to show
how true it is.
We are all familiar with the greenflies on the rose, and have
some confused idea of their enormous fecundity. We probably call
to mind Professor Huxley's computation of their amazing rate of
increase, but few of us have ever seriously considered the potential
danger of greenflies with reference to our food supply.
The late Prof. Riley, when studying the Hop Aphis, observed
thirteen generations of this species in a year. Assuming the
average number of young produced by each female to be 100, and
that every individual attained maturity and produced its full com-
plement of young, " the number of the twelfth brood alone (not
counting those of all the preceding broods of the same year) would
be 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (ten sextillions) of individuals.''
Such figures fail to convey any idea of the numbers, but dealing
with these Prof. Forbush has pointed out that if these individuals

to view, to a point so inconceivably remote that light could only
reach us from it in twenty-five hundred years."
But there is scarcely a cultivated plant that is not attacked by
one or more species of greenfly, or aphid as the naturalist terms them.
Of the trillion of billions that infest the apple, pear, plum and cherry
trees, and the hops, wheat, beans, turnips, cabbage, etc., what
becomes of them ? They are eaten by the birds. Aphids in large
quantities have been found in the stomachs of the Whitethroat, the
Warblers, the Tits, the Wren, the Goldfinch, the Chaffinch, the Sky-
lark, and numerous other birds ; and the same remarks hold good
with reference to the insidious Scale Insects.
Most insects do the greatest amount of damage during their
larval or caterpillar stage ; they feed voraciously, their daily con-
sumption of food often exceeding many times the weight of their
bodies. Selecting a familiar example, the yellow-and-chocolate
marked caterpillar of the Currant or Magpie Moth, it requires about
170 of these to weigh an ounce ; in their earlier stages say about 200.
We have seen currant plantations infested with these, and by counting
the number on one bush have estimated nearly 1,000,000 to the
plantation, or a total of 2J cwt. Had these been left undisturbed
they would quickly have consumed the whole of the currant-leaves
and ruined the crop, but thanks to the birds they were reduced to
insignificant dimensions long ere they had an opportunity of devas-
tating the bushes. And so it is with numerous other crops. We
might continue to cite insect after insect and the birds that feed upon
them, but one further case will suffice.
Trouvelot, who introduced the Gipsy Moth into the United
States of America, specially studied the American silkworm, and
respecting its food and rate of growth he made numerous experiments.
The rate of growth and the amount of food consumed are astonishing.
Upon hatching from the egg, the caterpillar weighs one-twentieth of
a grain ; when 10 days old its weight has increased to half a grain

or ten times the original weight ; when 20 days old it weighs three
grains, or sixty times its original weight; when 30 days old its weight
has increased to thirty-one grains, or 620 times the original weight ;
when 40 days old it weighs ninety grains, or 1800 times its original
weight; and when 56 days old its weight has risen to 207 grains, or
4140 times the original weight.
When 30 days old this caterpillar will have consumed about
90 grains of food, but by the time it is fully grown, namely 56 days, it
will have consumed not less than three-quarters of a pound of oak-
leaves. Thus the food taken by a single caterpillar in 56 days equals in
weight 86,000 times the original weight of the animal. Well might
Longfellow say of the birds:
" They are the winged wardens of your farms,
Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe,
And from your harvests keep a hundred harms."
In the interests of agriculture, fruit-growing and forestry
surely the conservation of this wild life is worthy of State attention.
We do not simply mean the passing of an Act of Parliament for the
protection of certain species, but a daily study of their habits and
activities, and all their intricate relations to mankind.
"But what about birds that are injurious ? " If those that
are beneficial should be protected, surely those that are injurious
should be destroyed. Our knowledge as yet of the feeding habits of
wild birds is so fragmentary that it would be dangerous to make the
unqualified statement that any species of wild bird is wholly injurious.
Some are partly so, due in all probability to the fact that they are
too numerous, as, for example, the House Sparrow, the Wood Pigeon,
the Starling, etc., but there is reason to believe that if these species
were much less numerous than at present, the good they would do
would more than compensate for any harm they might inflict. It is
therefore incumbent upon the State to walk very warily when it
proceeds to withhold protection, or to frame repressive measures for
the destruction of any species. In a like manner the granting of
protection to a bird at present generally regarded as beneficial may
lead to an undue increase in its numbers, and within a very short
time it will prove equally injurious. The problem is a most difficult
one. Those who demand all-round uniform protection are equally as

wrong as those who favour all-round destruction, and the State that
listens to either side or allows such extravagant views to weigh in
their deliberations is amassing troubles for the immediate future.
Only after a long and careful study can we arrive at a
satisfactory conclusion. Experience shows that it is possible to
learn with considerable precision the percentage of the different
kinds of food. Let us take the case of the Skylark. This bird
requires about six pounds of food per year, " so that 10,000 birds
would require about 27 tons of food in a year." As we now know
the percentages of food eaten by this species we can analyse this
figure. Of the total food consumed in a year 35 - 5 per cent, consists
of injurious insects, 3-5 per cent, of neutral insects, 2 - 5 per cent, of
beneficial insects, 95 per cent, of grain, 1-0 per cent, of leaves,
2 - 0 per cent, of earthworms, 1-0 per cent, of slugs, 1'5 per cent, of
miscellaneous animal matter, and 43 per cent, of the seeds of weeds.
In other words, 36-5 per cent, of the food eaten is of benefit to the
farmer, 505 per cent, is of a neutral nature, and only 13 per cent,
injurious. Thus we have a debit and credit account: on the former
side we place the loss of 21 tons of cereals, and on the latter
something like 30,000,000 injurious insects and 30,000 slugs. Such,
a plague of insects left to themselves would have destroyed many
more tons of cereals, root crops, etc. Thus the farmer is undoubtedly
the gainer by an enormous tonnage of produce.
The indiscriminate destruction of wild birds has led to serious-
insect plagues in many countries, so that any repressive measures
must only he the outcome of very careful consideration founded upon
long and accurate investigations such as the above.
To provide against extermination, State reservations as places
of refuge are necessary. Other countries have found such to be
profitable investments apart from protecting certain species of
birds.
The education of all who are connected with the land is
another most important avenue for State activities if we are going
to secure to generations yet unborn their birthright.
The subject of bird protection is an exceedingly wide one and
worthy of the attention of every enlightened community. " The
food relations of birds are so complicated and have such a far-reaching

effect upon other forms of life that the mind of man may never be
able fully to trace and grasp them," says Prof. Forbush; but this
must not be advanced as a reason why we should not steadily pursue
our investigations of the subject, knowing how directly it affects
mankind. If we do not we are jeopardising our food-supply, im-
poverishing the land, and lagging behind in the progress of knowledge,
and for such apathy and omissions Nature will surely sooner or later
demand just retribution.

By W. H. St. Quintin.
It is, I think, worth recording that a young Lesser White-
fronted Goose (.4. erythropus ) was reared here this summer. I have
had three of these birds since July, 1914. They were in rough con-
dition when they came, and very wild--indeed, they are still much
less confiding than any other wild Geese that I have kept, partly no
doubt because they are in a large enclosure, where they almost get
their own living. I believe there is a gander and two geese.
On June 2nd my keeper reported a Goose's egg in a nest
built against a fence some five yards from the water, and on the next
day I surprised, near the site, a single Goose, which flattened itself
out on the water and stole away, so of course I made myself scarce.
After this I never found the bird off her eggs, and I never once saw
the Gander near the nest. He was always in the company of the
third bird, generally at a considerable distance.
The Goose must have started to incubate when she laid her
first egg, for on June 28th I found that she had hatched a single
Gosling, which I saw being escorted away by both parents from the
bank where the nest was. I w r as so anxious not to disturb the family
party that I hurried away, unfortunately taking it for granted that any
other eggs must be unfertile. But there was a young bird in each, and
if I had put them under a hen at once no doubt they would have
been safely hatched. As it was, it was not till the 30th that I
revisited the nest, thinking to blow the remaining eggs for specimens.

130 Breeding of the Lesser White-fronted Goose.
Although it was fully forty-eight hours after the Gosling was hatched,
and though both eggs felt cold to the touch, I found that one was
chipped. So I put them under a hen without delay, and in a few
hours a second young bird was hatched, though it was not very
vigorous, and died on the fifth day.
The young Gosling with the parents throve exceedingly. On
July 27th I have a note that it was feathering, and that I could see
the ends of the primaries showing through the down. The parents
were most attentive, but very suspicious, and never brought their
young one up to feed, so it was reared entirely on grass, which, as
the weather was showery, was constantly growing.
Mr. H. Seebohm exhibited to the Zoological Society a young
female of this Goose, shot in September, 1886, on the Northumberland
coast, which showed no white on the forehead. In my bird the
orange edges to the eyelids, which are a special characteristic of this
lesser form of the White-fronted Goose, as well as traces of the white
forehead, were visible by the end of November. At the present
date--January 20th--the young bird is distinguishable from its adult
companions by its darker and duller plumage, the feathers on back
and wing-coverts wanting the pale edges of the adult. The patch on
the forehead is not so extensive as in the old birds, and not of such
a pure white. There are at present no black bars on the breast,
though with a glass I can distinguish some irregular patches of
slightly darker shade than the rest of the under-plumage, and which
may later on develop into bars.
Owing to " war conditions " I was unable to hand-rear
anything last summer, but two broods of Falcated Ducks--and seven
three---were reared by the parents, all except three eventually flying
away. Three young Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl were reared by the
parents running loose, a fourth being killed, as we believed, by
Jackdaws. To my great disappointment the first severe frost of the
autumn was too much for the cockerel and two pullets, and I was
of course unable to give them any artificial heat. They were probably
weakened by the poor quality of the only food obtainable.

A CURIOUS HABIT OF THE MOORHEN.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo.
It is of course a well-known fact that the young Moorhens
of the first brood will feed the young of a later brood ; but the
following fact seems of sufficient interest to be recorded. A pair
of Moorhens hatched a brood of seven young ones on a garden pond
close to this house on April 28th, 1918. In a fortnight's time this
brood was reduced to five, four of which had greatly grown. The
fifth was small and puny, and followed one or other of its parents
continuously uttering its querulous cry for food. I noticed that
whenever the parent found a suitable morsel it did not give it to
the small young one following it, but ran over to one of the strong
young ones, who were already commencing to forage for themselves,
and presented the dainty, whatever it might be. I expected the
weakling to disappear; but one morning, while dressing, I noticed
that it seemed stronger and more independent, and the reason was
evident. I saw a parent present a piece of something to one of the
strong young ones, who in turn ran ami gave it to its weak fellow-
nestling ! This occurred repeatedly, and the small young one
eventually grew up. In an early number of this Magazine I recorded
how the young of the Trumpeter Bullfinch ( Erythrospiza githaginea)
would feed their brethren of a second nest while they themselves
were being fed occasionally by their parents, so probably this habit
is more frequent than is generally believed. I forgot to mention
that the old Moorhens, in addition to refusing to feed the w&amp;apos;eak
nestling, occasionally turned on it and gave it a good tweak !

I believe Dr. Butler has been successful in breeding or keeping
Goldfinches for long periods. I have only been able to keep one
hen for a year, all the other four dying within a few weeks after
purchase except one cock, which was not sound ; it used to gape,
except during the very hottest part of last summer. The pair nested

and partly brought up two young, but, perhaps owing to moulting
coming on, they neglected them. The cock died later in the
autumn.
Two cocks which I bought this year died about a week after
being caged. All were kept separately, and all seemed to be well
when first purchased. Usually the first sign is over-eating and then
sitting up on a perch panting, with the head under the wing. The
panting gets worse until the bird dies. It sounds like enteritis now
I write it down.
The food they have in the cage is canary-seed, Indian millet,
summer rape, teazel, and a little hemp now and again, and groundsel
as green food. They also have a piece of cuttle-bone, with brown
paper at the bottom of the cage if they live long enough. They get
very fine sea-sand--coarser as time goes on--till they are let out
into the aviary.
I have noticed that they have nothing to eat in the shops
except niger-seed, which I believe is practically poison. Trying to
change the last bird's food gradually did not have the desired effect.
[Dr. Butler writes :
" You are quite correct; until about 1913 or thereabouts I
was never without Goldfinches from the time when I first began to
keep birds, and I bred them without trouble; but then I used to buy
my birds from the catchers, and if I could turn them into an aviary
the same day that they were caught they were not even wild, but
settled down at once.
" Goldfinches confined in small cages in a foetid atmosphere
and fed upon such rank, greasy food as niger-seed are very severely
handicapped, and frequently reach the hands of their purchaser in a
diseased condition.
" I am a firm believer in hemp for these birds, and especially
when they are a little out of sorts. Goldfinches, being naturally
active, can consume more fat-making food than, for instance,
Canaries, and you will notice that when one of them dies it is
generally alarmingly thin (the breastbone almost like a knife-edge).
" I used to give a mixture of two parts each canary and
millet (as well as millet-sprays), and one part each of German rape
and hemp, with a sprinkling of teazel or thistle-seed.

" When a bird over-eats it is generally due to enteritis. I
believe the poor wretch imagines that eating will cure the pain. At
such times a few grains of Epsom salts dissolved in the drinking-

A RARE AMAZON.
By Allen Silver.
A I&amp;apos;are Amazon came to the London Docks some time ago.
It is not in Reichenow and I have not seen it; the owner, who
knows his Amazons and has had most species through his hands
alive, is not sure of it. From what I could make out it is the
Guatemalan species.
I remember getting a Cayman some years ago. No one knew
what it was; hut, curiously enough, a friend bought the companion
bird and at last got hold of a Cayman skin, so that we were able
to satisfy ourselves as to what it was. It was such a noisy brute
that I gave it to the Zoo, because, being in rooms at the time, it
was awkward to keep.
[We would urge all members having rare birds to preserve
the skins after death, as such specimens are very useful for reference,
and of enhanced value if presented to some public institution, where
they can be studied by all. Thus the rare Lesson's Amazon formerly
belonging to Mr. Astley was presented by its owner to the Leicester
Museum, where it still is, its rarity still commanding interest, and
after death forming an attractive addition to the bird series of the
Museum. Similarly at the Zoological Gardens a number of skins
are presei&amp;apos;ved for reference; while in the great Zoological Park at
New York not only are the bodies skinned by the taxidermist, but
the carcases are used for pathological research.--G. R.]

[Reprinted from the ' New South Wales Education Gazette Supplement.']
What life and interest birds add to a garden ! Most countries
have certain wild birds that make their homes near habitations, and
look upon man as a friend rather than as an enemy. Australia is
specially fortunate in this respect, and most suburban gardens can
count on a dozen species which are regular inhabitants, besides
several travellers who visit us in the summer; but one only gets
to know them when they are off again, following the fine weather
northwards, and we are left with our permanent friends. Around
Sydney, these are the welcome Swallow, the friendly Willie Wagtail,
the plain-coloured Jacky Winter, the trustful Yellow Robin,
the perky Blue Wren, the dainty little Diamond Bird, the busy
Tits of two species, the dashing Spine Bill, the immaculate Magpie
Lark, and the plaintive-voiced Cuckoo; while the Kookooburra, the
harmonious Shrike Thrush and the Butcher Bird are never very
far away. These birds are a very efficient first line of defence
against our insect pests, and are splendidly organised for searching
every space where troublesome insects dwell. Some seek their prey
in the air, others look after the leaves of the trees, and still others
take charge of the bark, while the shrubs, lawns, and paths each
have their specialists, diligently searching their own particular
sphere for every living thing therein.
The Swallows are the aerial scouts of the bird army, and
make themselves responsible for keeping the air free of winged pests,
chiefiy the troublesome house flies and the mosquito. Sometimes
we see them high above the treetops, floating on easy wing, for mere
enjoyment, or chasing up and down the busy streets, in and out
of the traffic, or racing beside the trams to gather in the insects
disturbed thereby, or gracefully skimming over ponds, picking up
gnats from the surface, or boldly entering buildings to gather flies
from the walls.
The Wagtail, or, to be more correct, the Black and White

Fantail, also feeds in the air, but chiefly takes toll of small moths
and gnats that live near the ground. From the vantage point of a
rail or a tree, he swoops down on anything that dies into his range
of vision, or he makes friends with the animals at pasture, and snaps
up insects that are disturbed by them ; and one even visits the lions
in their large enclosure in the Taronga Park, and catches the dies
that are attracted by the ration of meat, and not infrequently takes
them off the body of the king of beasts. Has anyone ever seen
a Wagtail quite still? I think not; they often, like the Nightingale
at home, chatter half the night, as if impatient for the day when
they can again commence their hunting.
The Yellow-rumped Tit is a very important little bird in his
own estimation, always twittering and bobbing about, betraying
his presence to all and sundry. He shares the responsibility with
the Magpie Lark of looking after the lawns; and what a cunning
little nest-builder he is, with a clearly visible false nest above and
the cleverly hidden real nest below, evidently so made in order to
deceive the Cuckoo. He loves to weave string into the nest.
The Diamond Bird, or Pardalote, which must not be
confounded with the much larger Diamond Sparrow, is one of our
prettiest little assistants. The plaintive call notes, one high and
one low, uttered by the cock and the hen birds respectively, are often
heard, but the bird is not so easy to see, as it is generally hidden
among the leaves of a eucalyptus tree, among which they find their
food. The nest is in a hole in a sloping bank, and one wonders how
such a tiny bird can excavate such a burrow.
The Striated Tit, not so often seen, but still quite common,
lives generally at the top of the trees. It is coloured dull olive,
much like the leaves and boughs in which it dwells; it is a busy
bird, always on the move, and few insects will escape its vigilance.
The Silver-eye is the most common of our garden birds, and
also the best singer. To listen to its pretty song on a summer's
moi'ning is a delight. Although it will take toll of soft fruits when
they are ripe, it more than makes atonement by keeping the trees
free from insect pests all the rest of the year. It can often be seen
searching every leaf and shred of bark, and vigorously drawing forth
its luckless prey.

Garden birds in Sydney.
The active little Blue Wren is a most welcome visitor. On
account of its beautiful blue and black livery, and its clear ringing
note, it has been called the Superb Wren Warbler, which very aptly
designates this gem among birds. The Wren looks after the low
bushes and shrubs. Working with wonderful quickness, it searches
every nook and corner for its daily meal, and often jumps into the
air after a moth that tries to escape. Be careful not to approach
Blue Wren's nest, for if it thinks that it is detected it will abandon
it, and we cannot afford to lose one of these useful birds.
The Jacky Winter lives in the open, and with his plain grey
coat and well-known note is familiar everywhere. Sitting on fence
or low bough, he is ever on the lookout for crawling insects, ants
being, perhaps, the most favourite morsel. He is a quiet little chap,
and takes life easily, and if left alone gets very tame.
The Yellow Robin loves the shelter of the shrubs or flower
beds. It seldom ventures far from the ground, and is often seen
at the edge of the scrub, sitting tense and alert, or diving to the
earth after a caterpillar. It is one of the most trustful birds, and if
understood will come right to one's feet for food, and even sit upon
its pretty cup-shaped nest within a few feet of a camera.
The Spine-bill loves the flowers. A near relative of the
Humming Bird, he lives on nectar, and wherever honey-bearing
blossoms are in bloom there you will find him, probing with his
long bill to the bottom of the cup. Do you know his shrill double
call, " Pipiti, pipiti," so often uttered, to let his mate know where
he is ?
The Brush Cuckoo wanders about like a lost soul, and never
seems to have any friends. Its plaintive note is often heard, but
unless the bird is seen it is not easy to tell where the sound comes
from. Small birds treat him as an enemy, and yet when the Cuckoo
egg hatches out in their nest they do not realise the deception, but
work overtime to rear the voracious baby. Although the Cuckoo
deprives us of some useful birds by this lazy habit of not rearing its
own young, it makes up in another way by eating up the large hairy
grubs that other birds will not touch.
The Magpie Lark belongs to an orphan family, with no very
near relatives. It is a handsome bird in its immaculate black and

white dress, and it seems to take a special pleasure in looking after
suburban lawns and pastures, where at all times of the day it can
be seen industriously searching for snails and caterpillars.
If we have an eye to our own interests we will see that our
garden birds are made to feel thoroughly at home, for it would be
hard to calculate the value we receive from their presence. Their
wants are few -- they appreciate water to drink and bathe in, trees
to nest in, and chiefly protection from their arch enemy, the domestic
cat, an animal which no amount of care and feeding will cause to
observe the law, " Thou shalt not kill." They are quick to learn
where they are safe, and reciprocate friendship that may be extended
to them. The wild birds at Taronga Park are now numerous, and
delightfully tame; and one can watch them at their daily work
without them showing timidity. A pair of Yellow-rumped Tits have
nested on one of the lawns, where many people pass within a few
feet of them every day, and a pair of Red-browed Finches have their
home a little distance away, and the Finches often quietly steal
some of the Tits' nest with which to build their own, and the poor
little Tits have to work overtime to keep their home together. The
Willie Wagtails are sure that the camels are kept for their special
benefit, and they build most luxurious nests lined with their soft
wool. In winter time, when food is not so abundant, the Yellow
Robins will approach the picnickers on the lookout for scraps of
cake, while the Jacky Winters keep a close eye on the gardeners
when they are digging, in order to snatch up any grub that is
uncovered, and all are doing their bit for the general welfare.

Mons. A. Decoux writes to say that he bred several Many-
Coloured Parrakeets last year; he also has two Red-Collared Lori-
keets. From photographs kindly sent we see that his aviaries are
well planned and spacious ; the flights are roofed with large-meshed
wire-netting, giving ample access to the sun and (what is equally
important) to the rain ; an elevated perch, large enough to give a

the Many-Colours and the Lorikeets appear to be in perfect plumage
--not a feather broken; and as they are in such good trim we hope
that in the coming season M. Decoux will repeat his successes. We
had hoped to reproduce the photographs sent us, but unfortunately
on further scrutiny they were found to be unsuited for this purpose.

AMALGAMATION.
The Editor draws attention to the thoughtful and valuable
letter on this subject published elsewhere in this issue. Our
correspondent but voices the wishes of many of us when he suggests
that Bird Notes should be amalgamated with the Avicultural
Magazine.
The widespread and growing movement in favour of union is,
as we know, of many years' standing : negotiations favouring this
object have more than once been on foot. It has been said, and well
said, time after time, that there is no opposition between the
Avicultural Society and the Foreign Bird Club. To the man in the
street it must indeed seem amazing that in these days of dear paper,
dear illustrations, and emptying aviaries there should be two
Societies, both professing the same object, both hampered by many
difficulties, and by loss of members due to the War, yet each
pursuing its own way--disunited, dissevered, disrupted--as if their
aims were poles apart.
The cost of production is enormous. Those of us who
study the business side of natural history publishing understand only
too well why the coloured illustration is banished from our front

page, and the brevier type from our correspondence column. Only
by drastic economy has it been possible to keep the flag flying:
indeed, there are many natural history journals that have failed to
survive the War.
Under these circumstances we believe that Mr. Workman's
letter will be of the greatest service to zoology. Should the Foreign
Bird Club wish to be reabsorbed into the Avicultural Society--the
parent from which it originally sprung--a great gain, not only to
aviculture, but to ornithology in general, would inevitably ensue.

WOOD-STORK.
By George Jennison, M.A.
[Reprinted from the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1914.]
On June 2, 1908, a specimen of Pseudotantalus leucocephalus ,
which I judged to be six months old, came to Belle Vue Gardens
with other stock. It was at that time not more than half its present
weight. The beak was straight and rather slender, pale yellow in
colour. The pinions were of a dull black, the rest of the plumage
a yellowish-white. The bird ate fish freely, and has not had a day's
illness or check of any kind, so we may assume its subsequent
development normal. The first change was noted in February, 1909,
when the feathers on the larger wing-coverts were slightly tinged
with pink. During the next three years, that is until the spring
of 1912, there was a continual change of the yellowish to ever
whiter body-feathers, for the moult is extremely gradual and the new
plumes make quite a checkered pattern with the old : the dull black
of the pinions and tail took on a lustrous greenish tinge, and the bare
skin of the head became red where it meets the feathers of the neck.
These changes might pass unnoticed by the casual observer,
but in January, 1912, a drastic alteration supervened which could
not fail to attract attention. The white feathers of the smaller and
median wing-coverts of the chest and underparts of the wings were

slowly replaced by black feathers, with a narrow edge of white.
The perfection of plumage was reached in May, when the whole of
the shoulder was a wavy pattern of brilliantly contrasted broad black
and narrow white, and the bird in flight showed the same beautiful
coloration on the chest and beneath the wings.
The beak changes slowly, first thickening and afterwards
taking a pronounced downward curve, which continues to develop
long after the plumage-change is completed: its colour changes
meanwhile to a deep shiny wax-like yellow. During this time the
skin of the head, which can be drawn back an inch or more, also
continues to develop until the forehead and cheeks are a deep yellow-
umber, and the hinder part of the head becomes a rich purple.
The legs are now (1914) showing signs of a remarkable
alteration ; for five years they were grey with a slight tinge of pink
on the toes. The upper half of the tarsus is now a deep magenta-red.
EASTERN RAVENS.
By Ethel M. Jones.
Far away on the borders of Nepal and India runs a certain
ridge, covered with a belt of ancient forest, the trees of which are
tall and straight with no undergrowth, but instead a carpet of moss
and beautiful ferns growing in profusion under the shade of those
mighty giants.
This particular spot, some 7,000 feet above the level of the
sea, among mountain ranges overlooking the plains of Northern
Bengal, was selected by some Ravens (Corvus macrorhynchus) for
their home ; for far away from the haunts of men their nests would
surely be safe. For building there was plenty of material at hand,
and soon the nests of twigs and sticks were comfortably lined with
moss and wild cotton growing beyond the tiny stream which formed
the botmdary dividing British from Nepalese territory.
The patience of the old birds was rewarded at last, and each
nest held some four or five youngsters, who awoke to find a world--

though at that season a trifle cold--generally bathed in the glorious
sunshine of an early Himalayan spring.
There were few dangers,, the only enemy who might prove
tiresome being the wild cat, and he was too wise to attack nests so
zealously guarded. Thus time passed uneventfully, until one day
robbers appeared in the form of native youths, who, heedless of the
scoldings and plaintive cries of the parent birds, carried into captivity
some eight or nine half-fledged infants. They were taken some miles
away to the bungalow of an English Sahib who had, in a moment
of lightheartedness, without a thought for the consequences, said that
he wished for a pet Raven. The youths having retired with the
desired reward, the Ravens were consigned to an enormous cage, and
the Moorghi - wallah -- otherwise known as the custodian of the
poultry-run--was raised to the dignity of a foster-parent. What he
fed his ungainly family on remained a mystery, probably boiled rice,
which to an Indian is an ideal diet for all and sundry, together with
scraps obtained from the cook. However, the majority of the
youngsters survived the ordeal and only one or two succumbed.
Had they all departed this life it would have been pleasanter,
though less amusing for the neighbourhood, as subsequent events
will show.
Having an abundant diet, the youngsters flourished exceedingly
and became fine specimens of their kind, clothed in glorious black
plumage with a purple sheen. When old enough to fly they were
released from captivity--greatly to their joy, but not to that of the
neighbouring community. Instead of being models of respectability
and a credit to the moorghi-wallah who had lavished much care and
attention on their education, they became notorious for their thievish
habits and general immorality. Carpenters were working at that
time on a wing lately added to the bungalow, and it was chiefly on
their tools and other property that this little band of buccaneers
concentrated their energies. Most ingenious were their ways ;
a couple would be innocently warming a stone with every appearance
of intense interest, and the moment the back of the carpenter was
turned, down they would swoop and carry off a packet of screws,
a chisel, or anything bright and shining. A bunch of keys was

rescued one day only just in time. It was never discovered where
these treasures were hidden.
Happily the curses cursed by the carpenters were lacking in
the potency of those attributed to prelates, or the Ravens might have
shared the fate of their notorious cousin of Rheims. An ovarian
diet appealed to them so strongly that they missed no chance of
purloining any egg placed in a position to furnish opportunity for
larceny. These birds were embarrassingly tame and would take food
from one's hand and brazenly peck any inoffending human legs.
Eventually they became such a nuisance that a general appeal from
all and sundry, black and white, was made to the Sahib for their
speedy eviction. The black Barabbases, like the modern Irish tenant,
refused to be evicted, and they remained in the vicinity of the
bungalow, breaking the eighth commandment on every possible
occasion, until the season when the irresistible call of the wild lured
them away into the jungle, where doubtless they made homes for
themselves and laid green eggs splotched with brown after the
manner of their kind.
A long time after a pair returned to the bungalow, probably
two of those brought up there, for these birds are not generally
known near the abodes of men.
INDIAN BIRDS.
By Althea R. Sherman.
[Reprinted from the Wilson Bulletin, No. 90.]
Calcutta was the only place in which the Common Indian
Swift (Cypselus affinis) was identified. Numbers of them were
noisily flying above my hotel; both their notes and their appearance
in flight were suggestive of our Chimney Swifts. They are said
to build their mud nests against the beams and rafters of houses
and of porches, and return to these nests for roosting. This
trustfulness in mankind makes the species one of the many in
India that could be brought under very close observation.

Althea R. Sherman,
Of three species that were seen in great abundance almost
everywhere it is difficult to say which were found most plentiful.
All were more numerous in the cities than in the country. The
Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens) was not seen on Mount Abu,
and the Common Pariah Kites (Milvus govinda ) were not numerous
there. The Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis ) was not seen in
Bombay, although it is said to he a resident. Without appearing to
exaggerate it is not easy to give an adequate idea of the very great
abundance of these species. Nineteen Indian House Crows standing
on a plot of ground no more than ten feet square in a Calcutta park
were thought exceedingly plentiful, hut afterwards they were seen
in greater numbers. Looking up a narrow street the air above it
seemed full of the Common Kites, one hundred or more of them
being in sight; and of the Common Mynas, flocks of twenty or
thirty appeared ready to fly up from one's path almost everywhere.
Especially well named is the Indian House Crow, a bird that
belongs to the Crow family, found in India most abundantly in the
neighbourhood of houses. It is comparatively fearless, and in its
search for scraps of food will walk with the boldness of a very
tame chicken among a group of natives who are eating. Neither
is it averse to coming to porch floors or perching under porch roofs.
Those who are intimately acquainted with this Crow tell us that
it will enter houses and eat food from the table, " for there is no
right to which the Crows cling more tenaciously than the right to
be fed by the man whose compound they clean." " Black as
a crow " is not applicable to this species, since grey is the
predominating colour, although the head and nape are black. It is
a very noisy bird, and all day long one's ears are filled with its
tiresome cawing; how tiresome these sounds are is realized when
one is out of ear-shot of them. The failure to hear them on
Mount Abu was one thing that caused that place to be so attractive.
Their place was filled in a very slight measure by their cousin, the
Jungle Crow, or Indian Corby (Corvus macrorhynchus ).
The Common Kite, less hold than the House Crow in its
approaches to man, is by no means a timid bird. A lady in Delhi,
in relating to me her experiences with this species, said that once

<bodyText confidence="0.999345864864865" page_id="10105228"  page_num="Page 145" year="" vol="">
when eating out of doors a Kite came so silently and so deftly
snatched food from her hand that she was not aware of her loss
until the bird had flown some distance from her. On another
occasion a Kite tried to snatch from her hand a paper bag containing
food. Having read similar stories I was led to inquire of my guides
and other people if these were common experiences, and learned
that they were, except that often the Kite left a painful scratch.
A pair of Kites w r as watched w T hile building their nest in
a neem-tree that stood in the hotel yard in Jaipur. The work
proceeded very slowly. The twigs were carried sometimes in the
bill, sometimes by a claw; once the bird took up the twig by its
bill, then shifted it to a foot. Bill and claw were used about equally
in the carrying. It was at Delhi that Kites were observed when
going to roost in the top of a peepul-tree. They perched among the
topmost limbs on the highest twigs, and when the coming and going
ceased there remained for the night thirty-seven of these birds.
The Kite equals, if it does not surpass, our Red-tailed Hawk in
length ; in weight it must be very light for such small boughs to
support so many of them.
The Common Myna resembles in size and build the Starling,
but has the street habits of the English Sparrow, yet in some of its
country habits it is like the Starling, especially in its fondness for
the neighbourhood of cattle and for perching on their backs. It has
a fine appearance, produced by plumage that is black on head, neck,
and throat, and iridescent vinaceous on breast and belly. When in
flight it is easily recognized by the white patches on the wings and
the white on the tail. These spots of white serve to distinguish it
from its cousin the Bank Myna ( Acridotheres (jinginianus) , on which
the wing patches are pinkish buff, as is also the tip of the tail. In
the latter species the skin around the eye is brick-red, while in the
Common Myna it is yellow. The Black-headed Myna ( Temenuclius
pagodarum ) is known as the Brahminy Myna because of its elegant
appearance and the distinguished air imparted by its long black
crest, and the elongated feathers of its neck, throat, and breast, which
in colour resemble the breast of our female Robin. This species was
seen several times in a free state, also frequently in captivity along
with its cousin, the Grey-headed Myna ( Sturnia malabarica).

G. E. Low,
The avian sights viewed from the car windows that were of
a thrilling nature were confined to those portions of the journey
that were between Bombay and Calcutta, and to that which lies
eastward of Benares. Westward of that place the plains soon became
drier, then drought-stricken, and with increasing aridity the number
of birds decreased. East of Benares the level green fields were in
all directions very much alike. There was no lack of water, but
rather an excess of it. From the many ponds by the track-side were
startled huge birds : Vultures, Storks, and Herons, sometimes singly,
again in flocks. Often the train rushed past stupid-looking birds of
a smaller species, standing in the wayside pools. These grey,
obscure-appearing creatures frequently took flight, whereupon from
the grey unobtrusive forms there arose visions of white loveliness,
that floated off a short distance, then suddenly sank into the earth--
apparently--for the birds had alighted and were a dull, concealing
grey once more. Here in truth were the " Surprise Birds "! for
these were Pond Herons, sometimes called Paddy-birds (Ardeola
grayi).

Last autumn, to my great regret, I lost my hen Shamah (who
had reared eleven young in the season 1917), by a very unusual
accident.
The door of my aviary is about 3 inches thick, with double
wire netting, a provision against cats. It opens outwards, and is
governed by a steel spring. I had left the aviary, and the door was
closing by the force of the spring, when I was just conscious of
something dashing at the hinge--presumably to secure an earwig--
and in the same instant a little fluttering corpse lay on the ground,
cruelly crushed by the leverage of the door. This tragic end was
a great grief to me.
Even for a Shamah, she was exceptionally tame and wholly
attractive. In the breeding season this little mother never wasted
any time. When one brood left the nest she immediately got busy

THE INDIAN GREY TIT (Varus atriceps).
" There is only one Tit here, the Indian Grey Tit (Parus cinereus ),
a conspicuously marked bird, which bears a certain superficial
resemblance to the Great Tit so well known in England. The bird
is resident, and rears two broods in the year, commencing to breed as
early as the first half of March."--Surgeon-Commander K. H. Jones

repairing it for the next. One day she became confused in her
multifarious duties of building and rearing, and--presumably after
carrying a gentle or cockroach to the empty nest--attempted to
feed a young one with a thick grass stem, which choked it.
This, I fear, must not be considered an isolated accident, as
on opening the throat of another young bird, which had died after
neglect by its parents, I found a stout stalk, lodged at the junction
of the gullet with the body, as the cause of death.
The only young Sharnah which was fully reared--being on
the wing for about six weeks of last season--ended her existence by
swallowing a piece of stout white twine, 11 inches long, and with
a double knot at one end ! Her death being a complete mystery,
as she always appeared to be in perfect health, I opened the gizzard,
to find it entirely filled with the twine, rolled up in a compact ball.
The father of the family died in moult, after living with me
for about six years, which is the end of a rather unfortunate chapter.
I am glad to say, however, that I am able to start a new one with
another pair of these birds.
The cock was received in exchange last year from Mr. Holden,
and has been out of doors all the winter. He is a wonderful
songster, and in his repertoire imitates the musical sounds of cats
fighting with extraordinary skill. He also whistles a bar or two of
at least one popular air. His wife (bred here) frequently " talks " to
him when the gas is lit within, and black darkness reigns without,
and it is quite amusing, in the silence of the night, to hear an
occasional sleepy reply from the aviary.

The Indian Grey Tit (Parus atriceps ) is a Himalayan species.
It has been fairly frequently imported, but only in small numbers,
and it is consequently never very cheap. About the end of 1915
I purchased a pair from a dealer, one of which arrived dead ; and as
these were the only ones he had, I was unable to replace it.

Indian Grey Tit.
However, early in 1916 I was able to get another from one of our
members. It pi'obably came from the same consignment as my own
bird, which was, I believe, brought over by Mr. Harper. Un-
fortunately the newcomer was minus flights and tail, and was of
course quite unable to fly. She made up for this--I think it was
a hen--by her extreme activity on her feet: it was astonishing at
what a rate she could run up the wire netting. In spite of her weird
appearance she was a most engaging little, thing. She would nearly
always greet me with a perfect volley of swear words--or that's what
they sounded like anyway. It was certainly the same language she
used to let fly at her fellow-captives if they attempted to take a meal-
worm from her : I don't think that any of them ever succeeded in
doing so. The cock I never heard make a sound. Early in May
I turned both birds into an outside aviary containing plenty of
natural cover. The hen was still unable to fly, and as she was
evidently stuck in the moult I had little hope of her ever being able
to do so. As she could not reach the table I had to feed her on the
ground, and she would take peanuts and sunflower seeds, of which
she was very fond, from my feet, and would always come for a meal-
worm when I had one to spare. Unfortunately, whilst I was away
on holiday, my man must have neglected to feed her on the ground,
and I am afraid she was starved to death. On my return I secured
a hen Great Tit (Pams major), hoping that the surviving Grey Tit
\0x25A0would make love to her, but this he declined to do. In the autumn
to my regret he also disappeared, but whether he found his way out
through a hole in the netting or simply died I was never able to find
out. P. atriceps is a good deal smaller than an adult P. major, and
is not so bright in colour, but the young Great Tits are almost
exactly similar, and I doubt if anyone could tell the difference
without handling them. Mr. Temple very nearly succeeded in
breeding it in 1913, and given a sufficient supply of live food there
seems to be no reason why it should not be bred in this country.

By Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
I have to criticize, and that adversely, the coloured plate of
the wattle of Cabot's Tragopan as depicted in that splendid work
A Monograph of the Pheasants, by William Beebe. The colouring
as well as the shape is almost entirely incorrect.
I have had the great misfortune to lose my magnificent male
Cabot, which I found dead without any warning on March 28, just
as he appeared to be in fine breeding form, and was displaying to
his mate day by day. The bird was in very good condition, but had
nothing in his crop. Well! I made a close examination of the
wattle, then fully developed. In Mr. Beebe's Monograph of the
Pheasants it appears as dull orange in the centre with magenta
spots, surrounded by pale dull blue and yellowish-grey ; furthermore,
there is no scolloping on the outside edge around the whole wattle.
The horns also appear as pale mauve blue. It would seem as if
the painting by Mr. Gronvold has been done from a faded skin.
The gular flap, instead of following the line of the throat, as in his
painting, hangs out immediately from the base of the lower mandible,
and curves from the throat very conspicuously.
The colours are as follows in a living bird : Skin of face,
gular flap, and centre of wattle, a most vivid and brilliant orange,
the orange of the centre of the wattle being boldly spotted with
a warm lead grey, not magenta. Outside the orange area are waves
of a lovely turquoise blue-green, alternating with bright flesh colour,
except at the base, where the turquoise predominates. The whole
wattle is distinctly and beautifully scolloped. The scollops are gold,
i.e. really the colour of a bright "old" gold with an edging of
turquoise within.
The horns are also brilliant turquoise blue, inclining to an

to lose this splendid bird, which Monsieur Delacour had most kindly
brought me from France last year--a 1918 bird--and when he was
staying with me in March and saw it again, he said he had never
seen a finer specimen. The Tragopans are charming birds, the
males of great beauty, becoming very tame ; and in France, at any
rate, they are bred successfully. Temminck's and Cabot's are most
usually imported ; Satyra is rarer, and Blyth's and the Western
Tragopan ( T. melanocephalus) rarer still. No other species are
known, except wdiat is perhaps a local race of Blyth's in Tibet.
The display of the males is it wonderful sight, when the
wattle is let down over the upper breast like a curtain embroidered
with vivid and beautiful colours, the fleshy horns being erected from
beneath the silky crests.
MANCHURIAN PARTRIDGES.
By C. Barnby Smith.
For some years before the War I often saw in game-dealers'
windows in various towns in the spring, Partridges for sale with
a large black patch on the breast . On inquiry I was always told
that these were " Manchurian Partridges ". I shall be glad if some
member of the Avicultural Society could tell me the correct name.
Were they the Bearded Partridge (Perclix daurica) or were they
" Mrs. Hodgson's Partridge " ? The fact that they were called
Manchurian is very little indication, as trade descriptions of this
kind are hopelessly misleading.
Whatever is the correct name of the birds, it has occurred to
me that it would probably be a most interesting thing to have them
in captivity in England. I wonder if they have ever been kept, and
if so, with what result. They probably would be quite easy to
manage, and experiments might be made of crossing them with our
own English Partridge. It seems a case for some member of the

Avicultural Society who has connexions with the East to give
a little help. When shipping becomes normal it should not be
difficult to get them over.
[Mr. Meade-Waldo writes : " The Bearded Partridge (Perdix
daurica ) was largely introduced with Russian game before the War.
1 do not think it has ever been imported alive. It appears to be
a numerous species, and its range includes N.E. and Central Asia--*
northward into Dauria, eastward to Amurland, Manchuria, and the
mountains near Peking, westward to Dzungaria and the Tian-shan,
and southward to the sources of the Yangtze-Kiang. It would be
a very interesting bird to import alive, and should thrive in
confinement at least as well as our own Common Partridge."]
THE WILD BIRD INVESTIGATION SOCIETY.
The first number of the " Journal " is now prepared for
the Press.
The Editors invite contributions in the form of articles (of
000-3,000 words), notes, photographs, etc., which if found suitable
will be accepted for publication, it being understood that they are
offered to this Journal alone.
Contributions should be written or typed on one side of the
paper only.
Amongst other features, and in addition to original papers
and notes, there will be a series of notes and news of interest to
ornithologists and bird-lovers, a correspondence column, reports and
news from local branches, reviews and notes on current literature.
All communications should be addressed to Dr. Collinge,

of specimens without the intervention of a dealer ; for, next to eggs
collected hy oneself, it is surely most satisfactory to obtain them at
first hand from the actual collector.
We are pleased to learn that the publication of such a medium
is to be taken in hand by a well-known collector, Mr. K. L. Skinner,
of Brooklands Estate Office, Weybridge, who will he pleased to hear
from any member of the Avicultural Society who is interested in
the idea.
The publication, which is to be a monthly one, will probably
take the form of an Egg Collectors&amp;apos; Exchange and Mart and will be
issued to subscribers only.
It is hoped to publish the first number on June 1, 1919, and
thereafter as nearly as possible on the first day of each succeeding
month. The subscription for the period ending December 31, 1919,
will be 4s. and for future years 5s. No reduction will be made in the
case of those joining after the commencement of a year, but such
new subscribers will receive the back numbers of the year in which
they join.
The founder regards it as essential that only reliable collectors
should he admitted as subscribers, and will take all possible steps to
ensure this. No subscriber need therefore have any hesitation in
transacting business with any other subscriber.
We are pleased to learn that the advertisement of British-
taken eggs of certain species, the protection of which is so much to
be desired, will he absolutely taboo.
It is hoped that much may he done in the w y ay of bringing
together collectors in remote parts of the Empire and facilitating inter-
course between them, and between those in this country and America.
The information to be published will at first consist of sub-
scribers' advertisements and notes and comments on matters of
interest to egg collectors. Subscribers can advertise in any number
of the paper at a charge of  |d . per word, and will have the right once
in each year to a free 25-word advertisement. The names of all new
subscribers will be published once a year, on joining, and on renewing
their subscriptions, together with their addresses. Both names and
addresses can be omitted if preferred in any case.

Our Member, Mr. Barnby Smith, has sent us an interesting
and well-written booklet on his garden and aviaries. The work deals
successively (and successfully) with trees and flowers, with a rock
garden, with the birds in the garden, with the fish in the garden;
it has been a great pleasure to read this little work. Under two acres
in extent, the pleasaunce contains a miniature wood of pines and
larches and birches, with maples, poplars, and cedars, beds of rhodo-
dendrons and azaleas, clumps of irises; the portion devoted to rock
plants blooms with primulas and saxifrages. In the avicultural
section Mr. Smith tells us of his Pheasants, Partridges, Francolin,
Cranes, Ibises, and Oyster-catcher ("so-called because it never catches
oysters"), of his fascinating Waders and lovely Tragopans. Four
fine photographs illustrate this part of the book; those of us who
have read the author's bird papers published in the Magazine will
well appreciate the interest of the letterpress. An account of a
Rainbow Trout, tame enough to feed from the hand, concludes this
pleasant pamphlet.
The book has been well got up, and is almost free from errors;
on p. 17, however, we read " Kurroo " instead of "Karroo". We
were glad to see that the writer insists that Owls should only be fed
on six days of the week.

A Handbook of British Birds.
British birds, produced throughout by able writers, this up-to-date
and practical work consists of a series of keys for the identification
of the various species and subspecies, together with brief accounts of
the plumage in various stages, of measurements, field characters,
breeding habits, nest, eggs, and so forth. Special attention, indeed,
has been given to the varying stages of plumage ; ornithologists the
world over will appreciate the immense trouble that has been taken
in working up, so thoroughly, this complicated and difficult section.
The work is prefaced with a good introduction, a glossary, a scale of
measurements, and some carefully executed drawings. The entire
book is issued in eighteen parts, of which the first two, now before us,
deal with Crows, Starlings, Finches, and some of the Buntings. As
evidencing the care with which the writers have worked, we mention
the plate facing p. 16, showing the gradual change in the feathering
of the head of the Rook, illustrated by thirteen specimens. The
coloured plates are delightful; as, for instance, that which shows the
juvenal plumage of various Finches, the feathers being rendered with
exquisite softness and beauty; or Mr. Davies' family of Crossbills,
every detail set in hard clear outline against a pale-blue sky ; or
Mr. Gronvold's series of Bunting heads, each one a perfect study in
itself, clear-cut and brilliant, a veritable Nature cameo.
We recommend the authors to revise the legend below the
upper figure on p. xiv of the introduction ; for in spite of the drawing
accompanying it, the term " base of the skull " is anatomically
incorrect when applied to the root of the beak, an essentially anterior
structure; the term " glabellum " exists ready made, and should
have been employed here. In the glossary we were surprised to note
the omission of any reference to the tomium, though the clumsy term
" cutting edges of the hill " is carefully enshrined and moreover
explained. Although the lores is illustrated in the diagram on p. xvi,
there is no mention of it in the glossary. Part I, which we are
expressly told has been brought up to date, mentions the bird studies
of " Mr. " Eagle Clarke. It was news to learn that the term
" melanism " includes the abnormal presence of " very dark-coloured "
plumage--a condition to which we had thought the term " phasism "
had long been universally applied.

powerful union which will include all the British and Foreign
aviculturists; it would then be possible to issue a much larger and
more interesting magazine, with coloured plates and a much greater
amount of original reading matter under one cover. I would suggest,
too, that more space should then be devoted to notes and articles on
British and foreign wild birds ; travellers doubtless could give us
splendid descriptions of a popular nature of their experiences amongst
the birds of the various countries visited. I recall two intensely
interesting articles which came out in the early volumes of the
Avicultural Magazine--" The Birds of Ecuador," by Mr. W. Good-
fellow, and " Birds of the Bahamas ", by Mr. Bonhote. There must
and will be numbers of people who could write interesting notes
which would he of very great value to our members, but not perhaps
scientific enough for publication in the Ibis. Again, since the
Zoologist was given up there is a great want of a popular magazine
for British bird notes and descriptions of bird life in this country in
general. I know, of course, that we have that most interesting
magazine British Birds, hut it again is of a pretty high scientific
nature rather after the style of Ibis, and the Editors would not wish
to fill up their pages with notes and articles such as used to appear
in the Zoologist when in its palmy days.
Surely in these days of great business amalgamations the
Councils of the Avicultural Society and Foreign Bird Club could
meet together and produce a magnificent scheme for the good of
Ornithology in its widest sense; members then would not mind
paying the larger subscription, because they know that they would
he getting the best value possible instead of keeping up two Societies,
one in opposition to the other. This I believe to he the ideal plan,
but if not acceptable I would take a leaf from this " Distressful
Country " of mine ; here we have a little magazine called the Irish
Naturalist, which in spite of party fights does duty as the official
magazine of no less than seven different Natural History Societies.
If this can he done in Ireland, surely in England enough unity could
be obtained amongst naturalists to carry through a scheme on the
above lines.--Yours very truly,
W. H. Workman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.

SEMI-JUBILEE.
The Annual Meeting and Garden Party on July 17 will
indeed be a historic occasion : for not only is it the first post-War
gathering, but it also marks the Semi-Jubilee of the Society. Twenty-
five years ago Messrs. Fillmer and Simpson communicated with
Mr. Phillipps and Dr. Butler with a view to founding a Society
for the study of British and foreign birds in freedom and captivity ;
and&amp;apos;on November 1, 1894, the first volume of the Magazine was
issued. For the new science the apt name of "aviculture" was
proposed by Dr. Butler. The first list of members consisted of
fifty-two names.
From this modest beginning the Society and Magazine has
greatly increased and prospered : known the world over, with
a recognized status and authority peculiarly its own, the cause of
aviculture has been helped--or rather spurred--on by many highly
competent observers, whose notes and papers fill the substantial
series of back volumes which we trust adorn the shelves of all our
members. We continually receive proofs of the estimation every-
where accorded to our Journal : even in the present issue many
encouraging and helpful remarks will be found.

The Semi-Jubilee Garden Party at the Zoo.
In our correspondence column we publish several remarkable
letters : for now that we can once more resume this valuable section
it would seem as if a very flood of literature had burst forth. It
was well said at one of our Council Meetings that "the correspondence
was as interesting as the articles " ; certainly our members have
distinguished themselves in the variety and interest of the topics they
discuss.
First and foremost, the lifting of the war cloud coincides
with a sudden and most welcome revival of aviculture; the letter of
our member Mr. Rogers heralds the dawn. Once again the
aviculturist may read the ever-interesting lists of new importations
which so delighted him before the War. All our old friends are once
more with us: flaming Bishop, dainty Waxbill, steely Combassou ;
green singing Finches, yellow as the Canaries to whom they are
related ; delicate Cordon Bleus, graceful Whydahs, charming Silver
Bills. In these latter times the gate of Africa stands unbarred and
the golden days return. Before us lies an avicultural Paradise,
bright with opportunity.
With the fast-brightening prospect a new (yet old) policy is
fast developing, that of amalgamation. Shall the Avicultural Society
unite with the Foreign Bird Club ? Many of our members belong
also to the daughter Society, reabsorption would necessitate but
little disturbance. In our letter-box we already find proofs of the
stir occasioned by Mr. Workman's historic suggestion published in
the June issue ; to-day we print further evidence of the entente,
which, long existent, but seeks to reveal itself.
The Council hopes--nay, expects--that the Annual Meeting
of July 17 will&amp;apos;eclipse all previous occasions both in attendance and
importance.

THE FUTURE.
By H. E. Rogers.
I think that the Avicultural Magazine, and particularly the
back numbers, will appreciate greatly in value in the near future.
I find that illustrated natural history works are becoming scarce, and
generally three times the pre-War prices are asked. I have tried lately
to get Reichenow's Parrots : it was fairly common a few years
ago, but I have searched in vain ; I only had a badly cut up copy
offered at a high price.
I would very much like to write an article generally interesting
from the point of view of the importer and the private collector, but
must forego such an idea for the present. I have a greater pressure
of work than I can attend to, the difficulties of labour and material
are too great.
I have just received two magnificent Chimpanzees, and during
the past eight weeks have had through my hands some of the finest
ethnographic specimens that have ever arrived in Liverpool.
[We hope Mr. Rogers will send us his suggested paper, as it
would be of great interest to all.--G. R.]

(Rhea americana ).
By J. K. Butter, M.D.
In South America the place of the Ostriches is taken by an
allied group of birds known as Rheas, or as they are often termed
American Ostriches, which are distinguished externally by the presence
of three toes furnished with claws instead of nails, a head and neck

fully feathered, and the absence of a tail; the wings are proportionally
longer and are covered with big slender plumes, and the extremity of
the wing has a horny process. The flattened beak is broad at the
base and rounded at the tip, where it has a curved nail-like sheath.
The feathers on the head and neck are small, thin, and pointed, those
on the body are large, broad, and rounded.
In colour the two sexes are very similar, the cock being larger,
darker in his plumage, and having a band of darker feathers down the
back of his neck from the head to the shoulders. They are inhabitants
of the Pampas of Argentina and Patagonia.
The Rhea will readily take to water, and is a good swimmer.
They are gregarious, each cock associates with several hens. I had
in my field one cock which was kindly presented to me by the
Duke of Bedford. With this bird were three hens that I bought
from different places. One day early in July I noticed that the cock
bird had scooped a hole in the sand by the side of the fence, and the
hens had already each laid an egg, pale in colour. The cock began at
once to brood, sitting on the three eggs, and about every other day the
hens laid their eggs close beside him, and by the help of his beak and
his wings he scooped all the eggs under him until he sat on a dozen.
The first chicks came out on the thirty-first day, they were three in
number; on the thirty-second day there were another two out, and
before he came off the eggs he hatched nine altogether out of the
twelve. He took sole charge of the family, the hens were not
interested much, so I fenced him and the chicks in, and as soon as he
began to sit I made a rough shelter over him to keep out the wet.
The chicks were very hardy and fed well; after three weeks in the
pen I let them out in the field, and they then grew very fast.
Rheas utter a booming cry accompanied by a sighing or hissing
sound. My Rheas were very fond of running as fast as possible round
the field, with one wing outstretched and suddenly turning round, and
one day my cock bird whilst doing this broke his leg at the knee.
I put the leg up in plaster of Paris with gum solution, and it did
remarkably well. He was very patient, and rested it well, I could see
he was easier when quiet; when I removed the plaster his leg was
healed, it was a compound fracture into the joint. He had a stiff leg

afterwards. I fed my Rheas the same as the Emeus, on grass, grain,
roots, bread, fruits, Indian corn, dog biscuits broken up, cabbage,
lettuce, chopped turnips, and carrots.
The chicks were given a mixture consisting of the following:
Coarse chicken meal (scalded), ground meal, crissel (scalded), cardiac
powder (Spratt's), about two teaspoonsful to twelve chicks (increase
the quantity as they grow older), mix well together and dry out to
a crumbly state with barley meal, chopped lettuce, any insect food

Danvinii), less common, distinguished by its smaller size, shorter
legs, less uniformly coloured plumage, and pale-green eggs; and the
long-billed Rhea ( Rhea macrorhyncha ) of Northern Brazil--also a
small species, characterized by its longer beak, larger and more
flattened head feathers, longer body feathers, and more slender legs,
as well as by the general darker colouring, which is brownish-grey
mingled with black.
THE EMEU
(Dromceus nova-hollandice ).
By J. K. Butter, M.D.
The Emeu is next in size to the African Ostrich : the word
Emeu originally came from a Portuguese word, emea, meaning
a crane, and then any large bird, now by common consent restricted
to the latter. The Emeus are entirely restricted to Australia and
some of the adjacent islands, and are distinguished by the absence of
a helmet, such as adorns the head of the Cassowary ; the complete
feathering of the head and neck, unless at its upper part, which is
bluish in colour; and the normal length of the claw of the second
toe, the claws of all three toes being much shorter than in the allied
genus. Emeus are further characterized by the beak being depressed
and broad. The wing is very small and rudimentary. The common
Emeu has the general hue of the plumage light brown, mottled in
some parts with grey, except near the tips of the feathers, where

J. K. Butter,
they are black, with a broad subterminal band of rufous. In
Western Australia you get the so-called Spotted Emeu ( Dromons
irroratus) of more slender build, having the feathers barred with
white and dark grey, terminating in a black spot, with a rufous
margin, while the two sexes of the adult are nearly similar, the
female is the larger of the two. The male remains attached to
a single female, instead of being polygamous.
The note of the Emeu is a low booming or pumping noise
produced by the female by means of the expansion and contraction of
a large membranous hag surrounding an oblong opening through the
rings of the trachea. The male has no voice beyond a suppressed
hiss when angry and a sort of grunt when distressed.
Emeus take readily to water, and can swim well. Their
vision is keen and they are swift of foot. They can deliver a powerful
kick, and the blow is delivered outwards and backwards. Beneath
the skin these birds have a thick layer of fat, yielding a pale amber-
coloured oil which is free from taste or smell. The flesh is not
iinlike coarse beef and sweet to eat. They lay from six to nine eggs
of a beautiful dark green, resembling shagreen in appearance,
5f inches in length by 3f inches in breadth. These are nice to eat,
being very rich in flavour, and the contents of one egg just covers the
bottom of an ordinary frying-pan.
The Emeu squats down with its legs stretched out in front of
it. I had three in my paddock, they were very hardy birds, and had
a shed to shelter in if they liked; but they preferred staying out in
the field all night, and in the morning were often resting on the
ground, with icicles hanging from their feathers. The feathers are
double, springing from a single shaft. I have heard the lecturer in
a menagerie describe this bird as having neither tongue, wing, nor
tail, and every quill in its body bears two distinct feathers ! They
drink water freely, gulping it down, especially in the warm weather,
which distresses them a good deal. They feed on grass, roots, grain,
bread, fruits, Indian corn, broken-up dog biscuits, cabbage, lettuce,
chopped turnips, and carrots.
The female lays generally in a sandy hollow, and it is the
male bird that incubates the beautiful granulated green-coloured eggs.

He incubates for about fifty to sixty days; the chicks when batched
are very pretty, being longitudinally striped, brownish black and
grey. These stripes are continued on to the head, where they break
up into spots, while there are also others on the foreneck and breast
which terminate on the thighs. They are easily tamed, after a short
time, when they get used to the field. I had one arrive once that
was quite wild, and when let out of the box started running round
and round the field, pitching into the wall, till I thought it would kill
itself. I got help, and we drove it into a shed, where I had many
bags half-filled with hay and flattened out; then I nailed the bags all
round the sides of the shed, so that it could not injure itself any
further. I put plenty of straw on the floor, and kept it in the dark
for a couple of days, feeding it at intervals, gradually letting it have
more light, till I got it perfectly quiet, so that you could go in and
out from it without disturbing it. I then opened the door one
morning and let it come out itself, and I had no further trouble.

REPORT OF COUNCIL MEETING.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994808933333333" page_id="10105252"  page_num="Page 163" year="" vol="">
By kind permission of the Zoological Society a Council Meeting
was held at the Gardens on April 30. Present: Misses Alderson
(Hon. Secretary), Chawner, Messrs. Seth-Smith, Astley, Ezra (Hon.
Treasurer), Meade-Waldo (Chairman), Lieut. Gurney, Dr. Amsler,
Dr. Graham Renshaw (Hon. Editor).
An important offer for all the back numbers of the Magazine,
up to October, 1913, inclusive, was considered, Mr. Seth-Smith being
appointed delegate to discuss the matter and report to the Council.
The rules were amended to allow the Hon. Treasurer to become
ex officio a member of the Executive.
The unsatisfactory conduct of certain members, who did not
even assist the labours of the Council by paying their subscriptions,
was commented upon.
The Hon. Treasurer, in presenting his Report, stated a balance
in hand of #63.

Unpaid Subscriptions.
The Hon. Editor reported that it had been possible by strict
editing to effect considerable economy in the production of the
Magazine, considerable saving haying been attained regarding author's
corrections and extra small type.
The proposed change of publisher was discussed, and the
tender of Messrs. Austin &amp; Sons being approved, they were appointed
publishers of the Magazine.
It was decided to again insert a notice of the work of the
Society in the Year-Book of Scientific Societies.
The date of the Semi-Jubilee Garden Party was fixed for
July 17.
The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the Chairman,
and to the Zoological Society for the use of the room.
The Council then proceeded on a tour of inspection. The fine
collection of Parrakeets in the Small Bird House was visited, together
with the Mynahs, Fruit Pigeons, and Jays, and the smaller birds in
the outside flights. In the North Garden the Council inspected the
series of Tragopans, Pheasants, and Jungle Fowl, which also included
hybrid Peafowl, and a very good Honduras Turkey; two Great
Bustards were also on exhibition.
UNPAID SUBSCRIPTIONS.
It will hardly be credited that at this late period of the
avicultural year--especially in view of the post-War conditions which
hamper the labours of the Council--there are certain members who
have not yet paid their subscriptions.
The cost of producing the Magazine is so serious that the
Council, it will be noted, has rationed each issue to sixteen pages.
Every economy is practised in editing; no member of the Council
receives a penny for his or her services; all work is done for the pure
love of Science. After four years of a war which has made utter
havoc of zoological journalism, the Magazine still carries on amid the
graves of many contemporaries.
Every unpaid subscription is a hindrance to the already
burdened Council--a drag on the wheels of progress, a Cuckoo in the

confidently forward to the brilliant future just dawning.
But it can do nothing without money. Every member
regularly receives the Magazine ; the Council does not ask for alms,
but for its due.

Dear Sir, --It was with pleasure that I read Mr. Workman's
letter in the last issue with reference to a suggested amalgamation of
the Avicultural and Foreign Bird Club Societies.
In this matter possibly my opinion may not be required, but
as I have keenly interested myself in bird-keeping for more years

possession from the commencement, perhaps I may be permitted to
publish a few remarks.
In addition to an intimate connexion with other bird societies
and journals, I have been pleasantly associated with active members
of the Avicultural Magazine and Bird Notes and have contributed to
both these magazines, and during this time when trying to obtain
recruits to either or both I have more than once been unsuccessful on
the score that " both lumped " would be worth a subscription.
All worth publishing from either source would well go into
one publication, likely to sustain increasing interest, and I believe all
(who are not inclined to place personal ideas or interests in front of
aviculture) would be willing to help bring about such a state of
affairs, especially when an aggregate membership at the commence-
ment is hardly likely to exceed 500 subscribers. Such a magazine,
with its combined influential membership, would get a much larger
circulation and run of success if its Council undertook to safeguard
the legitimate interests of keepers of living birds, in addition to the
collection and publication of items relating to scientific and popular
aviculture.
I am inclined to think even to-day that ornithologists have
not awakened to the fact that of those interested at all in birds
by far the greatest number are those occupied in bird-keeping either
for reasons of recreation or instruction, and that the most entertaining
and reliable information relating to birds is that culled from a union
of scientific aviculture and field-work. Little of value (apart from
structural investigation) can he obtained from lifeless things, and ten
minutes with a living specimen will supply more information than
weeks with a preserved one.
It is to be hoped that something will be done to supply those
interested in living birds with a popular and scientific monthly
magazine, enjoying a much wider circulation than has at present
been the case, and as far as lies in my power I should he most
willing to help, although my spare moments in these days are

White-winged Wrens are concerned, I assure you that they made
quite a stir in the little world of bird-lovers here. I often wish,
when they come to take their mealworms out of my fingers, that my
old friend Mr. North could have lived to see them.
The Kagus are, I am afraid, little known at home, yet they
are exceptionally handsome birds, and if one gets them to display at
command, as mine will, they are indeed an attraction and joy to
their owner.
Rock Pebbler Parrots are again in the market--thirty or forty
came in a few days ago. I expect they find their way to America, as
all better and rarer birds do now. I just mention it as this species
has been out of the market for many, many years.
Through the drought numbers of birds have been driven in
and caught; for example, Regent Birds. I have quite a number,
mostly out of colour; there is about one coloured to a hundred brown
ones in the bush. I expect to make a good exchange with them for
American Finches and Soft-bills, as we get nothing new here at all.
African birds are right off the market.--Yours faithfully,

Dear Dr. Renshaw, --Although I consider Dr. Collinge's
article on the Protection of Wild Birds a useful addition to the
published literature on the subject, I do not agree with him that
birds or any other insect-eaters are of much use in reducing the
numbers of the Magpie (Gooseberry or Currant) Moth, because the
caterpillars and apparently also the chrysalides and imagines of that
moth are rejected by most, if not all, British birds, lizards, frogs, and
spiders (see my observations referred to by Darwin in his Descent
of Man, 2nd ed., p. 500 and elsewhere), though some foreigners have
been known to devour them.
Then, again, I am not at all satisfied of the advantage of
preserving the House-Sparrow : it undoubtedly drives away many
more useful insectivorous birds from our flower and vegetable
gardens, jloes far more damage to plants by nipping off leaves, buds,

and flowers, and snapping yonng twigs by its weight, than it does
good by the destruction of an occasional green-fly. Moreover, the
Sparrow breeds nearly all the year round, even in mild winters.
I remember that as a boy I liked it very much, with a bit of steak,
in a pie; but otherwise I shall always regard it as a public nuisance.
--Yours very sincerely,
A. G. Butler.
Dear Dr. Renshaw,- --With reference to Dr. Butler's opinion
as to birds feeding upon tbe larvae of the Magpie Moth (Abraxas
grossulariata ), I regret that I am unable to agree with him. Firstly,
because I have taken them on numerous occasions from the stomachs
of the Blackbird, Song and Mistle Thrush, Blue and Great Tits,
Whitethroat, Chaffinch, and other species. Secondly, in the spring
of 1918 a most interesting case came under my notice, which was very
carefully inquired into. Some currant bushes were noticed to be
very badly infected with the young larvae of the Magpie Moth, and
for the first four or five days after they appeared they attracted quite
a number of Song and Mistle Thrushes, which were observed feeding
upon the caterpillars. Over a hundred were found in the stomach of
a Song Thrush, and fifty to sixty were common in some of the Mistle
Thrushes examined. Suddenly the birds ceased to feed upon the
larvae. On examining the bushes many larvae were found to remain.
Some were collected (forty-one examples) and kept. From these
I reared fourteen masses of cocoons of Microgaster and twenty-seven
specimens of Exorista. Not one of the larvae entered upon the pupa
stage. Further, after most careful searching, not a single pupa could
be found beneath the bushes, and we have scarcely seen a moth,
although there must have been tens of thousands of the larvae.
Here, I think, we have an excellent example of two natural
agencies, viz. wild birds and insect parasites, practically controlling
what would otherwise have developed into a serious plague.
These larvae may not be eaten to the same extent as those of
other common species, but it is certainly a mistaken impression that
they are entirely avoided by wild birds in their free condition.

As to the House-Sparrow, I have never advocated preserving
it; on the other hand, I have strongly protested against the apathy
displayed in its destruction (cf. Nature, June 28, 1917 ; Journ. Board
Agric., p. 67G, September, 1918; National Review, pp. 606-12, June,
1919). Whilst I should be pleased to see, in the interests of
agriculture, strong repressive measures instituted, I am not in favour
of any policy advocating extermination. The House-Sparrow is
injurious because it is too plentiful.--Yours,

admirable accounts of his Australian trips. Since then I have built
an article upon the subject as a whole, and I trust to have it out this
year. A letter from Captain White came in my mail this morning
along with yours. All to a day, his was two months on its way here.
Am glad to learn from your letter that there are so many
interesting specimens living in the London " Zoo "; I've been a
Corresponding Member there since 1886. In the old days I was
a correspondent of all the leading British zoologists of the Victorian
era, but now nearly all of them have passed away ; there were over
500 of them on my list. They were the most prominent ones of
their day, as Sir Richard Owen, Darwin, Huxley, Sir William H.

" Before I left Brinsop in November one of my 1918 Monauls
died, I think from bronchial catarrh, which finally seemed to choke
it. The bird was very strong and quite plump to the last."

PARRAKEETS, LORIKEETS, AND LOVE-BIRDS.

species made no attempt to nest last year.
The female Many-coloured (Psephotus multicolor) laid four eggs
in February and sat very steadily. The eggs were all clear In May
another clutch of four eggs gave two beautiful male birds.
I have kept these Parrakeets with various little birds, and
though their aviary is a very small one they have never tried to injure
their companions. They are wintered in an aviary the shelter of
which is shut during the night, but during the day only when it is very
cold or wet.
This species is particularly attractive. Besides its beautiful
colours, its musical whistling voice and its tameness make it very
desirable for the bird-lover.
The Rosy-faced Love-birds (Agapornis roseicollis) hatched and
reared first four and then five young ones. One of the last brood was
accidentally crushed in the nest-barrel by its brothers. It is a pity
that these fine birds have such an unbearably shrill shriek.

F. W. H. Seppings,
The Redrumps began to go to nest in the last days of February,
but in March the cock was so excited that he killed the hen before she
had laid her eggs.
The three pairs of Black-cheeked Love-birds (Agcipornis
nigrigenis), after laying some clear eggs, hatched and reared four, four,
and three young respectively, but did not nest again after the little
ones had left the boxes.
These small Parrots are very wild ; a pair of mine, which is
kept alone in a little aviary, is afraid of the least noise--the barking of
a dog, for instance--and hides in the nest-box as soon as anybody
approaches the cage. The two others are not so fearful, though timid.
My Mealy Rosellas reared four young, one of which was deformed
and died some days after leaving the nest.
The female Blue Budgerigar was too young to lay eggs this year.
I have never bred from my Red-collared Lorikeets ( Tricho -
glossus rubritorquatus). These birds always spend the night in a very
large box. Last May I saw them pairing (on the ground), but, though
during the whole summer they appeared to be on the point of nesting,
no eggs were laid. Like other Lorikeets every season they always seem
greatly attached to each other.
Two weeks ago I received another pair of this magnificent
species, bred in France by a bird-lover. The breeder wrote that they
remained sixty-seven days in the nesting-box, and were fed by their
parents chiefly on bread soaked in milk and a little ripe fruit.

I thought perhaps it might interest you to see how the preserva-
tion of birds is treated in South Africa nowadays, so I am sending one
of the notices issued here which shows that the matter is regarded as of
" a purely local nature ".
It is nearly three years now since I came out here. I have been
in Pretoria, Cape Town, and Durban, but I have had very little time
to devote to birds,

A thing which has surprised me very much is the enormous
number of Canaries kept. Many are kept in large wire cages, five or
six feet long, and six to twenty birds in the cage. 1 am told that
before the War large numbers of Canaries used to be imported from
Europe. I have seen a few seed-eaters, Waxbills and Weavers, and
a Parrot here and there, but with these few exceptions all the cage
birds 1 have seen were Canaries.
The Zoological Gardens at Pretoria and Durban have good
collections of birds, but I did not see anything of outstanding interest
in either of them, except the sun-birds in Durban, which were
wonderfully beautiful.
In Cape Town there is no zoological collection open to the
public except the Rhodes collection at Groote Schuur. This is very
small but very remarkable, by reason of the huge size of the paddocks
in which antelope are kept. This is not good for purely exhibition
purposes, but it enables one to see Ostrich, Gnu, Springbuck, etc.,
grazing on the open hillside without the usual obtrusive, close-drawn
fence. Eland one may meet anywhere, as they are generally free to go
all over the estate.
As regards wild birds, Pretoria is a very birdless town. There
are a few South African Sparrows, Cape Robinchats (Cossypha cajfra),
Wagtails, Doves, and other birds in some of the gardens. A short
distance out of the town one may see the Secretary Bird. Certain
Palaearctic birds pass through on migration, such as the European
Swallow and Spotted Flycatcher.
Durban is remarkable in that it has two common and very
noticeable birds which are seen all over the town, both of which are
imported. The one is the English Sparrow and the other is an Indian
Mynah. The Town Council debated the advisability of destroying
the Sparrows some time ago, but finally decided to let them live.
It would appear that they are extending their range, and that they
must necessarily get out of hand and become a serious pest in course
of time. They are as badly behaved here as at home. I watched one
pestering a pair of Rufous-breasted Swallows (Hirundo semirufra )
which were nesting. It is a terrible mistake not to kill off these Sparrows
while there is yet time.

Durban Bay is very remarkable also for the extreme tameness
of the waders. No guns are allowed. Curlew, Whimbrel, the Lesser
White and Cattle Egrets, Heronsj and many small waders feed quietly
twenty yards or less from the esplanade wall when the tide is low.
I have seen the White-bellied Stork and some kind of large Fish Eagle
over the bay, one of the latter making a practice for some weeks of
roosting on a pole about a hundred yards from shore.
Cape Town has very few birds. The Cape Wagtail (Motacilla
capensis) is common and extraordinarily tame. They will walk about
and feed within a few feet of one, or sit on a wire fence as one passes
within easy reach of a walking-stick .
The English Starling, Spreuw (Spreo hicolor), White-eye
(Zosterops capensis), Cape Robinchat, and Doves are often seen, and
sometimes Glossy Starlings. A common Starling nested in the mouth
of one of the stone lions that guard the Castle gate one season. I am
told the Starlings do a certain amount of damage when the figs and
grapes are ripening, but nobody in the town seems to bother about
them, and there are a good many.
There is a very beautiful race-course in the suburbs of Cape
Town at Kenilworth. Great care is taken to keep the turf in good
condition. This is apparently much appreciated by a Secretary
Bird, which I have several times seen walking round the course, but
not on race days.
During my several journeys to and fro between here and
Pretoria (one thousand miles) and here and Durban (twelve hundred
and fifty miles) I saw very few birds. A good part of both journeys is
over the Karroo, and there I saw only a few Swifts, the White-bellied
Crow, and Ostriches. Where there is water in the upper part of Natal
there are a good many small birds, but on the whole the number of
birds seen from trains here is very small compared to the number seen
from English trains.

BIRD LIFE ABOUT MOREE, N.S.W.: THE HOME
OF THE WHITE-WINGED BLUE WREN.

By an Old Australian Bird-lover.
Many a time in years gone by, when 1 stood before the exhibits
of the Australian Wrens in the Sydney Museum, I looked longingly at
the White-winged Blue Wrens, the gems of the whole tribe.
The late Mr. North, extracts from whose book on Australian
birds have several times appeared in this Magazine, and with whom
I spent pleasant hours when he came to see my birds (especially during
the nesting season), told me that his White-winged Wren was found in
the extreme west of N.S.W. on 20 miles from the Cobar-Bourke Railway,
and 500 miles away from Sydney, living amongst the Roly Poly weeds
in this " never-never " country. From my experience of these in-
hospitable regions I knew it to be useless to attempt transporting such
delicate birds, even should I catch them.
The Moree bores enjoy the reputation of possessing great curative
properties, and I made up my mind to try them myself. Mentioning
this to a gentleman also interested in birds and knowing the Moree
district well, he told me when I showed him the various species of
Wren--I have five--that I would probably find the White-winged Wren
there, as he had personally seen them. That settled the trip, and
without much loss of time my son (whose holidays fell just then and
was also an enthusiast in bird matters) and myself set out for Moree in
quest of the White-winged Blue, Wren.
The little township of Moree is situated in the great western
plains of N.S.W., 420 miles by rail from Sydney. The journey is
uninteresting and tedious, especially during the trying summer weather ;
but one is pleasantly surprised to find such an out-of-the-way little
place so well laid out and cleanly kept. The streets are lined with
Kurrajong trees and Silky Oaks, which were in flower at the time of
our visit. Hundreds of Leatherheads were feeding, fighting, and
vociferating amongst the foliage. They are not pretty, but the old
male bird looks quaint in his bare head and frilled neck. Quite a number

of other Honey-eaters were noticed, with which we were not familiar.
In the mornings between five and six on our way to the Bore Baths we
noticed hundreds of Red-rumped, and here and there a pair of lnany-
coloured Parrakeets, feeding in the streets; whilst Galahs in their silver
and pink plumage could always be seen flying in pairs over the town.
The Mehi River flows through the town--that is to say when there is
water in it; at the time of our visit there were but pools here and there.
It is spanned by a very modern bridge. Looking down from it we could
at any time see, not many yards away, various species of Water-fowl.
White and Grey Cranes, Black and White Shags, Water-hens, Dotterels,
and other species of birds came to drink and hunt early in the morning.
A little out of the town we noticed flocks of Spurwing Plovers, and came
across a pair of " Plain Turkeys Numbers of Masked Wood Swallows
perched on fences and wires; happy families in their sombre attire were
seen wherever a little scrub existed--miserably, for the drought had
killed almost every tree not growing on a watercourse. Top-knot
Pigeons were quite tame and everywhere in evidence, and, except in the
Northern Territory, I have never seen so many Hawks of various
species. Strange to say, Diamond Sparrows and Redhead Finches were
quite absent, whereas there were plenty of Double-bars and Fire-
tail Finches. Following the dry river-course--residents assured me
that during wet seasons it will rise 20 to 30 feet--it seemed to us as if all
the birds in the district had come to live there as a kind of summer
holiday resort. It was a perfect Babel of noises, songs, and screeches :
in my many wanderings never have I seen such a congregation of birds
of various species as in this narrow valley; it shows what careful pro-
tection will do. Near Sydney such an idyllic spot would be unthinkable,
since most parents seem to delight in the prowess of their children when
they destroy with their pea-rifles all that comes within reach. The
common Blue Wrens were absolutely innumerable : Wagtails, Scissor-
grinders, and Peewees were everywhere; so were the rowdy Soldier
Birds, White Eyebrowed Caterpillar-eaters, and others. On the
Town Common we often saw birds quite strangers to us, such as Black
Magpies with white under wings, and the Mutton Birds, one of the
proudest and stateliest birds I know, silver grey--a very light silver,
and a white throat, chest, and abdomen--twice the size of a Starling,

but very slender, with a careful and measured gait--a real regal bird.
We were able to get within less than ten yards of them to admire their
beauty. Here we also watched a native bear feeding on the low
branches of a gum-tree ; we should have dearly loved to bring it along
as it was almost within reach--but one might just as well be honest--
we were afraid of being caught!
Our excursions into the surroundings of Moree, however prolific
otherwise, were not crowned with success in finding the object of our
visit--the White-winged Blue Wren. None of the residents (and we
asked many) had ever seen or heard of it. There was but one thing
left, and that was to go out into the plains and try to locate them there,
though we feared this, too, would be hopeless, since the senseless
method of using rabbit poison had cleared out first and foremost all
birds thereabouts. Still we went. It was frightfully hot--never a day
below 108* Fahr. in the shade of the hotel verandah. The ground we
passed over was dry and crumbly, and threw up again the enormous
heat stored in it. In fact, it was so contracted that great fissures had
appeared, often the width of a hand, and seemingly of an interminable
depth. As far as the eye could reach nothing could be seen but an
endless stretch of the Roly-Poly scrub. This weed is an annual. It
shoots up a small stem, the thickness of a finger, a few inches above the
ground, then spreads out, developing into an even huge ball from
4 to 8 feet high. Succulent and liked by the cattle when green and
young, it grows and dries very rapidly, producing exceptionally
prickly, needle-like thorns. Then the main stem rots, the body
remaining intact, the wind catches these prickly balls and rolls them
along at a tremendous pace. In their mad career they mount those
bushes still standing, going " roly-poly " over them until they strike
the station fence, where we have seen them piled up 20 and 30 feet deep.
Rain and heat soon destroy this barrier.
This is the home of the White-winged Blue Wren. It was
a happy hour when we located the first pair, but to catch them was
another matter. They refused to come to a decoy (in this case a
common Blue Wren) and the bird-lime, exposed to this fierce heat,
became absolutely useless, whilst mealworms had no attraction for them.
They are exceptionally shy birds, always hiding ; the male seldom

indicates their whereabouts by his warble, which is very similar to
that of a Lamberz Wren, yet sweeter and shriller. We soon found
that they could only be located by their call, like the Emeu Wrens, as
they seldom show on the top of the bushes like the Common or
Lamberz or Red-backed species.
With infinite trouble they had to be rounded up, doubly hard on
account of the heat, the sun parching us to an extent that we could
hardly speak. The prickles of the Roly-Poly were a veritable scourge
to our bodies, and the mosquitoes and flies--well, it is over, and
remembrance always modifies the evils ! But it is only the extreme
enthusiast, amounting almost to a crank, who will leave the comforts
of a home and spend a holiday undergoing discomforts (to say the least
of it) for the sake of getting a certain species of bird. However, all is
well that ends well; we were successful in the end, and brought away
with us from Moree quite a number of these little treasures, now doing
well in my aviaries and that of my friend. We were fortunate in
locating the nests of these birds later on, and might have saved our-
selves a lot of hardships had we seen them before. It appears they do
not build in the Roly-Poly where they generally live, but in Acacia
bushes inaccessible by virtue of their strong thorns. The remarkable
thing is that most pairs we saw breeding were grey birds--that is to say,
the cock bird out of colour. Quite contrary to other Wrens, which
breed when the male is in his " wedding dress ". It is a matter of fact
that we only saw four coloured cock birds, two of which we brought
home, out of about ten pair. I need hardly say that our excitement
was intense when we were able to admire our first coloured male bird
in the cage. These birds must fly long distances for water, unless they
ken of a little pool unknown to us. In the open and at a distance the
coloured bird looks like a black and white Butterfly ; it is only when
seen in cage or aviary that its beautiful hues appear. The whole
bird is a rich cornflower blue, only the shoulders where the cover-
feathers are enlarged, or seem to be, are white. The flight feathers are
a bluish-grey. They are the smallest species of Wren I have known,
and exceptionally slender. To my sorrow several escaped by squeezing
through half-inch wire mesh. They are exceptionally easy to get on to
artificial food, and my misgivings on this point were quite unfounded

(Chrysotis bod ini).
By Allen Silver, F.Z.S., F.R.H.S.
Since the Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton in 1899 contributed notes
on Chrysotis for this journal, I do not remember having seen any mention
of Bodin's Amazon Parrot therein. On that occasion the writer said
he had not seen it, although from the B.M.C. he knew of its existence.
In twenty years I do not remember seeing more than a single specimen,
although one would suspect that a bird hailing from British Guiana
and Venezuela would be less rare. Probably it passes with other trade
birds unrecognized into private hands. One frequently meets with
surprises of this kind. Only the other day I discovered a lovely pair of
Blackheaded Caiques at the rear of a baker's shop, where they were
kept and known by the owners as " Macaiques ", coming from far up
the Amazon River. A short time ago I saw advertised a Red-fronted
Amazon, and knowing how sporting are these cover-all descriptive terms,
such as " Red-fronted ", I gambled, not expecting, of course, C. vittata.
On arrival the bird proved to be Chrysotis bodini in excellent
condition. I see in my Russ, p. 555, vol. iii, Parrot Section, that it
was probably first received, or at least recognized, on the Continent
forty years ago, and it has been represented in our Zoo.
Those possessing Butler's Foreign Birds Jor Cage and Aviary
(probably the handiest book extant for an aviculturist) will find it
adequately described. It, however, suffices here to mention that it is
one of the small red-rumped and red-headed Amazons, with lilacine
and bluish head and neck ornamentations. In behaviour it reminds me
of C. viridigena, and yelps mornings and evenings like that and other
Amazons, which character seems the curse of the group.

Recent Work on the Hoatzin.
I am glad, however, that my bird is not over-tame, and has none
of the cackling, fatuous, and drivelling mannerisms of a pet Bluefront.
I feed this bird in the same way as others of the group, i.e. mainly on
canary seed, plus a little oats and maize. On occasions hemp and
sunflower is given, and lettuce leaves and fruit. Those possessing
Dr. Ant. Reichenow's Vogelbilder aus fernen Zonen, Papageien, will
find the bird figured by G. Mutzel on plate xxxii, fig. 8. The Boche
there calls it the " Rothstirn-Amazone ", and groups it in his Antlro-
glossa (A. bodini, Finsch) ; whereas on plate i, fig. 3, the bird described
as Rothstirn-Amazone ( Chrysotis bodini, Finsch) is figured with a green
and red head, and is apparently the bird we call C. finschi. This book
is probably one of the most useful Parrot books in existence, and in the
colour process the faint lilac bands in finschi may not have shown up.
Miitzel's drawings, as a whole, are very good, especially as I daresay in
a number of instances they had to be made from skins. One little
character seems well stamped in this species, and that is the faint line
of blackish feathers immediately beneath the red-fronted patch,
and extending from the bill to the eye ; and this somewhat obscure
marking gives the bird an austere and slightly fierce expression, which
I do not think H. Goodchild would miss. Of late his very accurate
and characteristic work has been singularly absent from these pages.
I notice my bird exhibits an odd red feather on the lower chest, which
feature is not uncommon in other allied birds. Variation seems very
prevalent in Amazons as a group, although for that matter I cannot
say I ever saw any two living things exactly alike.

ordinary fowl and its quaint, almost four-footed nestling ; to-day we
note the valuable treatise on its anatomy by Dr. Shufeldt, published in
vol. xxxi of the Journal of Morphology.
Several young and sub-adult Hoatzins were received by
Dr. Shufeldt in the winter of 1914-15 ; their external appearance and
also the structure of the skeleton is shown in four most interesting
plates appended to the memoir. All aviculturists, we suppose, are
pre-eminently interested in nestlings ; in these clear photographs we
have the secrets of the South American jungle before our very eyes.
The photographs, very beautiful and full of detail, were taken by
Dr. Shufeldt himself.
A sub-adult specimen studied was still in pin-feather when
obtained ; the skin was quite thick and tough, as was also the case,
though to a less extent, in the chick. Although the bird was nearly able
to fly, the skeleton was still almost entirely composed of gristle ; even
the all-important breast-bone was chiefly cartilaginous, though quite
thick and substantial. In view of the uncanny climbing powers of the
almost quadrupedal nestling, it is interesting to note the enormous feet,
with their strong, powerful digits, and curved claws. All the specimens
figured had been carefully preserved in alcohol, with excellent results,
for no shrinking or distortion is seen in the photographs, even the stout
scaly covering of the feet being perfectly rendered.

One Sunday afternoon in May this year I went down to Richmond
Park to spend a few hours away from all the crowd and rush of London,
and finding a comfortable looking oak-tree to lean against near the
Penn Ponds, waited to see what birds were about.
In the branches of the tree above my head was a Tree Pipit,
singing that joyous careless song of his, which has so much in it that

reminds one of the caged Canary, but without the Canary's ear-splitting
persistency.
From the dead branches of an oak in front of where I sat came
the loud sonorous drumming of a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. For
a while I was unable to find him, as he insisted, as Woodpeckers will
the world over, on keeping the branch he was on between himself and
me. But he soon got used to me, so that I was able to watch him for
some while, through my glasses, as he rapidly hammered on the dead
wood, which is a sort of love-song that is, I believe, only made by this
family of birds.
From my position I was able to hear no less than three male
Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers drumming at once. Surely it would be
difficult to find any other place in England where so many of these
small Picidae abound, and this only half an hour's journey from
London ! They seem much more plentiful here than in the New
Forest, which is such a good place for all the Woodpeckers, specially for
the Greater Spotted.
Presently I became aware of a most restless small bird which
flitted about the lower branches of an oak-tree ; and proved to be
a female Redstart, which was presently joined by her handsome mate.
Herons flew over occasionally, evidently carrying food to their
ravenous young, which could be heard honking and coughing somewhere
amongst the tops of some high trees in an enclosure not far away.
In this same enclosure were a few Chiffchaffs, a hilarious Green
Woodpecker, and a Cuckoo.
Just in front of me in some rough low-lying ground, with clumps
of last year's dead bracken, was a pair of Whinchats, evidently, from
their restless movements, feeling very uncomfortable about my inten-
tions, which made one suspect they had a nest somewhere about,
particularly as the hen soon disappeared, probably back to her eggs.
How often birds " give away " the whereabouts of their nests by
their cries and actions when by simply remaining still and quiet the
enemy, whether feather or not, would suspect nothing and pass on !
Some two hundred yards further away was another pair of
Whinchats, the cock in very handsome plumage.
While sitting by the pond a little while after, watching a pair

of Great Crested Grebes with their young, I heard the song of a Black-
cap ; and presently the bird flew up out of a clump of rhododendrons
on to a branch of a tree, where I had a good view of him.
The Grebes were swimming about under the overhanging
branches of a small island in the middle of the pond ; their two young
ones, about a third the size of their parents, showed a bold and
adventurous spirit by occasionally sallying forth some little way out
into the open, to the apparent annoyance of their parents, one or other
of which woidd come out and escort them back to safety amongst the
bushes.
With the aid of field-glasses it was quite easy to see the curiously
striped heads and necks of the young ones.
Most of what are called the common birds abounded : White-
throats, Chaffinches, Jackdaws, Robins, Blackbirds, and many others ;
surely no other great city can boast of such a number and variety of
birds in her suburbs as London can ?
What makes Richmond Park such a good place to observe birds
in is, I think, the huge number of harmless visitors that go there daily,
for many birds that would skulk and hide when approached anywhere
else, seem here to be almost indifferent to such an everyday sight as
a human being--or two--sitting beneath a tree.

A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK OF BRITISH BIRDS*
We have received a further instalment of this useful and well-
written work. The section before us deals with Buntings, Larks, Pipits,
and Wagtails--a favourite group with many, embracing as it does such
interesting forms. Both illustrations and letterpress are a pleasure to
study, and the high level of the preceding parts is fully maintained. We
would specially mention Mr. Gronvold's exquisite plate of Wagtails,

executed with wonderful finish and accuracy ; while the separate
feathers drawn on plate vi by Mr. Frohawk are so delicately rendered
that one almost expects to see them blow away. Other pleasing
illustrations are the figure of the Black Lark's head on p. 149, and the
Shore Lark's head on p. 168. We are pleased to see that the authors
draw attention to the habit of simultaneously soaring and singing
practised by the Wood Lark ; also to the deep yellow or orange colouring
occasionally seen in Wagtails.
On the other hand, the figure of the Calandra Lark on p. 151 is
too Hawk-like ; the Short-toed Lark on p. 154 is feebly rendered ; the
Crested Lark on p. 157 is too much like a Cardinal. We doubt if the
Snow Bunting really nests among " larva " blocks.

We welcome the June and July issues of this new and long-
needed publication, devoted entirely to the needs of egg-collectors
throughout the world. In his foreword the Editor, Mr. K. L. Skinner,
rightly expresses his confidence in the future success of the paper, for
the first list of subscribers contains names known to all ornithologists--
while the July number shows a rapid increase in membership.
The supply of the once familiar sets of German-taken eggs--
Golden Oriole, Greater Reed Warbler, Great Bustard, and what not--
has been completely stopped by the War ; one well-known dealer,
writing us some months ago, stated that even in Allied or neutral
countries it had been found impossible to procure certain species. In
these circumstances the foundation of a league of oologists, by means of
a special journal, will prove of the greatest benefit to ornithologists.
A special data label has been suggested, a sample of the same
having been forwarded to us. Briefly, it is an extension of the old
British Museum method of marking on the actual egg the name, locality,
and date ; to our mind by far the best style of record. Owing, how-
ever, to the naturally limited space available on the actual specimen,
various data labels have been devised ; the present example is excellent

EXTINCT BIRDS.
Dear Dr. Renshaw, -- I still have the photograph you sent me
of the Dodo model, which is in the collections of the Museum in Paris,
and the two others that came with it. The matter of modelling
restorations of extinct birds greatly interests me, although I have not
been in that field for several years past. In all such matters I chiefly
depend upon the collections of our United States National Museum
here, and they are truly wonderful in their extent and general com-
pleteness. We have a mounted Great Auk and a plaster cast of its
egg--possibly an egg ; while on the other hand, we have done very
little in the matter of " make-ups Possibly they do more of that
class of work up at the American Museum in New York City. In the
Scientific American Supplement, several years ago, I published many of
Rothschild's extinct birds, and in 1884 an article in Century Magazine
on " Feathered Forms of Other Days ". There was a drawing of mine
of the Dodo in that article, also the Great Auk, and various other
birds and reptilian birds, including a terrible restoration of Archaeopteryx
which I " disowned " long ago. As you know, I have published a great
many papers and formal works on fossil birds, and I have probably
described more species than any other palaeornithologist living. We
have no flightless birds in our United States avifauna ; the Great Auk
has been written to shreds, and Lucas has fully described our Great
Auk mount. My figure of the bird has been published over and over
again--even in school books and general lexicons. It will, nevertheless,
afford me great pleasure to get you up some short article on an
ornithological subject.
On the other hand, we have fine skeletal restorations of our
extinct birds, such as Hesperornis and a few other forms. I could
readily touch upon allied subjects, as Great Auks' eggs, etc. What

has been done with Diatryma in the American Museum is well known
to me, and I feel sure you are familiar with Dr. Matthews' excellent
paper about it; D. ajax is my own species. We have here a superb
mounted group of our now extinct Passenger Pigeon, and one of the
Carolina Paroquet as well; but they are all actual skins. I have
published in American Forestry an elegant picture of a pair of the
extinct Labrador Ducks ; the block, however, would be too large for the
Avicultural , but I have the original photographs from the mounted
birds.
The time will soon be here for the civilized part of the world
to move ahead again ; then, as now, I am with you to the limit to push
biological science to the front.
Cordially yours,
R. W. Shufeldt.
THE WATER RAIL.
Dear Dr. Graham Renshaw, -- I wish you could persuade
some member of the Avicultural Society to try and get the English
Water Rail to breed in captivity. I have seen a good deal of these
birds, and am satisfied it could be done if a true pair could be
obtained. This might mean concerted action on the part of several
members, but the result would be most interesting.
Yours very faithfully,
C. Barnby Smith.

SEAGULLS.
I wonder if a great war is necessary to make one recognize the
full joy of a holiday on the Cornish .coast. The contrast between the
constant rush and strain of war work and the peace in beauty of Nature
is so great; how else can one appreciate the difference between " on
duty " each day in the wards at 8 a.m., and hardly stopping till
evening, and--lying on one's back on a thyme-scented cliff, with nothing
to do but watch the Gull's ceaseless activities, to the soothing
accompaniment of the waves breaking, and fussing, tearing, and
rending at the rocky sentinels of the coast. What a relief to watch
other things doing all the work !
People go miles and pay much money to watch an aeroplane,
but I defy anybody to produce a more wonderful exhibition of grace,
dignity, and power than a Seagull. To watch them soaring, turning,
dropping, rising, with hardly a flicker of their wings, is indeed
wonderful ; and then--the joy of being above them !
To look down on their smooth glossy backs, so trim and neat,
tapering gracefully to the small head and cruel beak ! Never think

Adliii,
you know all the beauties of a bird till you have watched it from above.
There was one great rock out a short distance from shore, quite
impossible to scale, and inhabited by hundreds of Gulls, Razorbills, Shags,
and Cormorants. What hours we spent watching them, and how
fascinating it all was ! On one occasion a full-grown Gull seized
another (which was peacefully sunning itself on a rock) by the wing
and held on remorselessly. The victim struggled and pulled without
any effect. After at least ten minutes the tormentor let go. There
seemed to be no animosity displayed afterwards, so perhaps it was a
token of affection, but it looked extremely painful. The young Gulls
were in all stages, from little balls of grey down to large ungainly
youngsters just able not to fly ; and our amusement was great one
day to see mother Gull administer a hearty cuff to an adventurous
youngster, who on a windy day was trying his wings in imminent
danger of being wafted into space.
Oh ! the delight of a fluffy baby when it stretched what it
called " wings ", and actually left the earth for an inch or two! I
wonder how many do get blown away ? I found one starving to
death with a broken wing, and as it was out of reach one could only
hope a Black Back woidd come and put an end to its misery. Further
along the coast were a pair of Ravens, and another of Peregrines, not
forgetting innumerable Pipits, Larks, Whinchats, Stonechats, and
Wheatears, which kept one always amused by their efforts to disguise
the family. On one occasion I was searching for a rare flower, when
I heard " chack ! chack ! " and saw a cock Wheatear hovering and
dipping angrily over a depression in the ground. I " froze " to see
what it was about, and along came father Stoat with a fat Rabbit; an
awkward parcel, which had to be dropped several times before home
was reached. It made one marvel at the courage of small birds, and
reminded me of an incident I had just seen in a friend's garden. A
pair of Blue Tits had built in a box on the house, under which a large
yellow cat took up her quarters, with the idea I suppose of catching
a baby if it should fall out. This was more than mother could stand,
so she fetched father, and these two balls of blue and green tossed and
swooped, and swore to such good purpose that the cat was driven off
defeated. I watched in fear and trembling, for they almost settled on

her in their fury, and I thought of what would happen if her paw shot
out and caught one of the brave little pair. It was good to see their
joy when the enemy departed. But, alas, our perfect holiday, like all
good things, has come to an end, and we can only now look forward to
another year, and another visit to the Cornish birds.

By Capt. B. Hamilton Scott, R.F.A.
In 1917 I sent a few notes on birds seen in France and Belgium.
Since then the list has gradually increased, and below I give the
number of species up to date.
In February of 1918 I was fortunate in being sent to the South
of France on duty. There, in a very pretty district, 9 miles north-east
of Marseilles, I expected to be able to add considerably to my list.
This, however, was not the case. Among the more interesting species
were the Hoopoes, in fair numbers, usually in pairs, the first being
seen in April. They were not particularly wild, and allowed one to
approach fairly closely. Their prettily contrasted plumage, graceful
crests, and slow undulating flight made them very noticeable features
in a country which at that time was rather lacking in bird life. A
small, rather insignificant Finch of a greenish tint was noticed in small
numbers frequenting the pine woods of the district. It appeared
similar in shape to the Lesser Redpoll, and its note w T hen in flight
resembled that bird. At first sight it was not unlike the Siskin, but
closer inspection showed the black cap wanting, and the beak w r as not
so pointed. In the Natural History Museum at the Palais de
Longchamps, where, by the way, there is a fine collection of birds of
the district and of Provemje, I was able to identify it, according to the
museum labelling, as " Venturon Citrin (Citrinella alpina). What its
English name is I am unable to find out.*

Capt. B. Hamilton Scott,
Warblers were seen in great numbers from the middle of April
onwards, Blackcaps being by far the most numerous, no clump of
bushes or grove of trees being without several male birds in practically
full song. Both species of Whitetliroat, Garden Warblers, Nightingales,
and Willow-warblers were also to be seen and heard ; a great number
of these soon disappeared on their northern migration, but some of
each stayed in the neighbourhood to breed. Numbers of Bed-backed
Shrikes were to be seen hawking insects from telegraph wires and other
points of vantage. Another handsome bird was the Woodchat Shrike
--at least, I take it to be that species. The colouring, roughly, is
white breast, rich brown head, back and wings a mixture of brown
and black. It habits were very similar to those of the previous species.
Specimens shown in the Museum are described as " La Pie Prieche
a tete rousse " (Lanius rufus). A bird which I was very keen on
seeing was the Garrulous Roller (Coracias garrula). One had been
seen several times in the neighbourhood by my C.O. He called it a
" blue Jay ", but I knew from his description it was a Roller. We
went out several times to look for it, but without success. Of the
Finches, certainly the most common was the Goldfinch, which might
be seen any day in the orchards or on any rough or weedy ground.
Chaffinches, too, were quite plentiful. Golden-crested Wrens were
sometimes seen in the pine woods, and the ubiquitous Magpie was
always in evidence. At all seasons of the year the so-called " sports-
man " of the district wanders round with a gun, letting drive at any-
thing that flies. Thrushes and Blackbirds seem to be his favourite
" game ", and consequently there are very few of these birds to be seen.
In the rugged hills to the south-west there was a small bird which in-
habited the close undergrowth on the hill-sides. It had a harsh jarring
note, and though heard pretty frequently it kept itself well screened from
view, and was only actually seen three times, and then at too great
a distance to give a detailed description. Its general colouring seemed
to be a dark bluish-grey, and it was about the size of a Lesser White-
throat.
The part of France passed through showed many signs of war
and the German occupation. Practically all the woods had been cut
down, so it was not a likely part to see anything beyond the usual

common species which generally frequent the war area. But, near
Le Cateau, I saw my first Black Redstart, and during the next few days
several small parties were observed (November). Belgium, however,
had not suffered half as severely from the Germans. In hardly a single
instance had their woods or plantations been touched, nor had fruit-
trees been wantonly destroyed as was the case with France. The
country improved as we progressed eastward, and some very beautiful
parts were traversed--principally through the northern portion of the
Ardennes. Here bird life was much in evidence, and the Lesser Spotted
Woodpecker and the Nuthatch were seen for the first time. In the
valley of the Ambleve, where the scenery was very fine, numbers of
Water-ouzels might be seen flitting from rock to rock in the stream.
After crossing the frontier into Germany (December) the country
became very bleak and cold--open heath-like country with pine and
spruce woods. Stuffed specimens of the Capercaillie and Black Grouse
were seen in a shooting box, but no living birds were noted. The
pine woods sheltered all the commoner Titmice, and both the Crested
and Longtailed abounded. (The former I had seen for the first time
in the woods near Rouen.) Gold Crests were also very numerous.
Shortly after Christmas, when the weather became rather more severe,
I came upon a small flock of Snow Buntings. This was another
addition to my list. Fieldfares were in large numbers, feeding on the
berries of the Rowan-trees, which in this part of Germany are planted
along the roadsides. Redwings did not seem so numerous as their
larger cousins, and were met with in smaller parties. Jays are nearly
as plentiful as Magpies were in France and Belgium. One pair had
nested here in what I consider rather an unusual site for this species--in
a pear-tree trained against the wall of the house, and npt many yards
from one of the windows. The Little Owl is common round here, and
may often be seen in the daytime in the old apple orchard. It has
been seen or heard in nearly all the districts passed through on this
march, and is one of the few birds found actually in the trench area
among the ruins.
In the hall of a large house near here (south-west of Cologne) is a
rather interesting collection of stuffed birds. The shooting of the rarer
and more beautiful birds seems a common practice in this neighbourhood,

most houses possessing some stuffed specimens. The owner of the
place gave me to understand that all the birds were shot close by.
Certainly the most interesting bird was a large black Woodpecker.
(I do not know if this is its correct name or whether there are any other
members of this group.) In size it was considerably larger than the
green, of which there were two examples. The colour was black, and
there was a brilliant red crest. It was rather nicely mounted, as were
most of the other birds, which included : A Golden Oriole, a Hoopoe,
a Nightjar, a Landrail, a Water-rail, a Greater Spotted Woodpecker,
and the poor inevitable Kingfisher. There were also some birds of
prey in very natural attitudes--a Merlin, a Peregrine, a Buzzard, and
a Montagu's Harrier.
Black Redstarts in small parties had been seen here at different
times, but it was not until the beginning of April that they appeared
to have settled in the district. Within a comparatively short distance
from the old moated farm where the mess is three pairs may be seen,
each occupying its own area and zealously guarding it in the same
manner as the Robin. In habits they much resemble the ordinary
Redstart or Robin, flitting in and out of cart-sheds and old buildings.
The song, though described in one handbook I have as " rich in tone ",
is certainly not so musical as that of the Redstart proper. It starts
with a very peculiar and distinctive note, most difficult to describe--
a kind of wheezing, grating sound, and ends with a few pretty twittering
notes. One day (April 8) whilst watching a pair of these most
interesting birds a splendid male specimen of the ordinary Redstart
appeared, the first seen in Germany. This is about a week earlier
than usually seen in any part of England (Suffolk). The pair of
Black Redstarts which frequent this farm built their nest in a crevice in
the under side of the bridge over the moat, and successfully reared a
family.* The nest was too deep and the crevice too narrow to allow
* The same pair of Black Redstarts mentioned above have built their
second nest in a hole in the wall of the farm, not five yards from their old nest,
and are busily feeding another family ; so it seems that this species is double-
brooded. There is quite a collection of young birds in the neighbourhood now.
They frequent the open fields and meadows, especially where the hay or clover
has been cut, sitting on the tops of the ricks or on the wire fences catching
insects.

and lack the black breast and light crown of the male bird. Other
migrants were arriving now, and among the more interesting were
numbers of Pied Flycatchers, which suddenly appeared about the first
week in May. I hoped they would stay and nest, but they remained
a week and then completely disappeared, being replaced by their
spotted confreres who have established themselves here. Golden
Orioles, a specimen of which was first seen on May 10, are not uncommon,

Have not been in Westmorland and Cumberland this season.
Carrion Crow-- Plentiful in all suitable localities. Many pairs
bred in suburban London.
Hooded Crow .--Have visited no breeding quarters, but saw
winter passage birds in usual numbers. Flanders " reeked " with
them in the line in 1916-17 winter.
Chough .--One naturalist friend reported their appearance, but
have not been that way.
Rook .--Needs no comment. Still clings to certain places in
Suburbia, and has apparently never varied in my lifetime except
when May droughts have made it difficult for them to feed their young-
Jackdaw .--Excessively prevalent where I have been. This
season reared large broods in townships and villages as apart from
woodland colonies.
Magpie .--Young and old pretty numerous in Monmouthshire
and South Wales, and heard good accounts from other localities.

Jay. --Seemed common everywhere I have been. Saw two
breeding pairs in Suburbia, and met with good flocks in Kent, Surrey,
East Anglia, and North and South Wales.
Starlings.
Starling. --Has, as usual, teemed. Some earlier broods now
clean moulted (August).
Larks.
Skylark. --Thick everywhere ; bred well into outskirts of the
Metropolis.
Woodlark. --Have been only where it is a shy breeder or passing
migrant, and have no reports of its breeding this season.
Buntings.
Common. --Met with breeding pairs in usual quantity in East
Anglia and North and South Wales.
Yellow. --Plenty in East Anglia. Saw very early nestlings this
season.
Reed. --Common in proper haunts ; early broods on wing this
season. Applies to East Anglia and western localities.
Cirl. --Have had no breeding reports sent in, but it cropped up in
winter in usual numbers and saw one to-day (August).
Finches.
Hawfinch. --Good accounts of this shy bird. Saw it in East Anglia
February, 1918, and have one youngster caught on peas here now.
In this district they came in good large parties right into walled-in
gardens, and mutilated and destroyed the tall varieties of choice peas.
This occurs usually early in the morning.
Crossbill. --Am out of touch with the localities where I can
usually find it, even when no flux is on.
Bullfinch.- --Plenty of these " primers " wherever I have been.
Saw strong broods both sides of the country.
Chaffinch.-- Needs no comment, except that in many places with
the Greenfinch equals and in some cases exceeds the House Sparrow
in numbers.
Brambling. --Snow and slop prevented me getting out, but saw
several, and it " cropped up " in the snow of 1918 all over the place.

House Sparrow .--Many pairs, apparently thrice brooded.
Ousted many Martins as usual.
Tree Sparrow .--Occurs in usual places ; saw several on some
old willows recently, but have not been where I could see the big
winter flocks that usually occur on the Suffolk and Essex borders.
Greenfinch .--Prevalent everywhere, many strong broods about.
Nested close into Suburbia. South Wales specimens differ slightly
in notes from those in East Anglia. Cannot see where this bird claims
close relationship to Coccothraustes vulgaris (Hawfinch).
Siskin .--Came quite close to town in North Kent in winter of
1917-18. Have heard nothing from Scotland.
Goldfinch .--In its proper places has apparently kept up its
numbers in at least twelve counties, for the last twenty-five years.
Saw large numbers in Hunts, Beds, Carnarvon, and it was breeding in
village streets and small gardens in East Anglia as usual, and in all
the parks I passed, there favouring the chestnut. Saw a really big
departure flock in 1916 about to leave a South Coast point. This flock
I saw collect in a short jieriod, and when I disturbed them the last
time I saw them feeding on flat thistles in closely nibbled grass ; the
company must have numbered between 300 and 500 birds. If one is
there at the right time and spot one can annually see flocks nearly as
large, if not quite, but not for long.
Redpoll .--It may be imagination, but seems to have increased
the last ten years as a breeder. Breeding birds passed over my garden
and alighted on my aviaries daily this summer. Saw it nesting in
Surrey suburbs. Prevalent in all its own country haunts that were
visited, and saw as many as four breeding cocks in one cemetery later
with their broods.
Mealy Redpoll .--Plenty of " intermediates " were noticeable,
but was unable to gauge anything as to last winter's migrant birds of
the larger and whiter forms. This and the former species can be graded
right up to the giant white and pink type, and they feed each other,
sing, and behave absolutely similarly. Am by no means satisfied as
to wide differences [apart from subspecific variation] in Redpolls.
Aviculturists should interbreed and test for ready fertility in order to
settle how far apart Redpolls really are. As far as I can judge from

behaviour they do not seem much farther apart than is the case with
small examples and typical north-eastern examples of the Goldfinch.
This cannot be thrashed out with skins.
Twite . -- Some few occurred with the catchers in 1918 in usual
quantities, i.e. moving parties. Have no account of this season's
breeding.
Linnet .--Saw old and young in fair quantities in East Anglia,
Kent, and Wales. Resident winter birds were " hit badly '' by the
1916-17 winter, so much so that distinctly fewer pairs were noticeable,
where formerly they teemed. I have known from forty to fifty broods
occur in a season in one pleasaunce, and have seen them in cloud
parties later in the same district. Even now they can be heard hourly,
but are distinctly less.

DR. LOVELL-KEAYS.
It is with great pleasure that we note the safe return of our
valued and esteemed colleague Dr. Lovell-Keays ; every member will
congratulate him on his restoration to health after his arduous and
perilous war service. We recollect his articles contributed under the
name of " Secretarius ", and his labours as Hon. Business Secretary ;
now that he is once more with us we hope to again profit by his wisdom

THE REVIVAL OE AVICULTURE.
Dear Sir,-- In Marseilles there are several good bird shops.
These (which is, perhaps, more than one would expect!) are well kept
and clean, and the birds well looked after. Their principal stock
beyond the usual Canary consisted of large numbers of the commoner
African finches. There were also many Weavers and Whydahs of
different species, quite a number coming into colour. One proprietor
had recently bought birds from a ship from South America, as there
was a fine group of Red-crested Cardinals and a number of Saffron
Finches, all in excellent order. Some Blue-fronted Amazons and
Canary-wing Parrakeets were also in this shop. There seemed to be
a ready sale for the Cardinals and Finches, for in a few days most were
gone. The prices, too, were much below the English, even in pre-War
days.
In another shop was a fine brace of Green Glossy Starlings,
also numbers of Senegal Palm Doves and the pretty little Emerald

with apparent dearth of birds in Great Britain, inclines me Ut express
an opinion on bird life in certain localities which I have visited
somewhere between October 1917 and 1918. Owing to circumstances
I have been prevented from getting where ordinary two-legged
individuals can go with ease ; in consequence, I can only conclude
that a good many of the accounts deploring the scarcity of a species
either arise from hearsay or from the fact that we are rather apt to
draw erroneous opinions from relying upon immediate impressions.
Circumstances are entirely responsible for these impressions, and
because we do not happen on a certain day to arrive at favourable
results, we are apt to forget that the next ten days, when we are else-
where, a good number of incidents " crop up " which did not occur on
the particular day when we were exploring. Twenty-five years close
study of the variability in numbers of a species has led me to this
conclusion. Every little while we get winters of such severity that
a drastic pruning occurs, which obviously only affects those species
actually remaining in a locality. Even they flee before the severity
of the weather, and only a small proportion are caught napping--so
much so that by the end of the next breeding season no noticeable
difference exists. Three or four times in my lifetime only have we
had a winter which froze birds in the sides of the stacks and in the
shrubberies, and which played real havoc with Thrushes and certain
small but prolific species, and on each occasion they quite recovered
by the following autumn. Readers of Lorna Doonc may remember
that Jan Ridd (fictitiously of course) gives an account of a hard winter
such as I mean, but evidently Blackmore had experienced such
a time, and makes his character give a pretty graphic account of what
takes place among birds on such occasions.

I do not append the following particulars as being of great
value, because I am now unable to do what I used to do ; but the
results obtained, although half-hearted, are w T ell on the side of
accuracy, because they could well have been supplemented by
individuals who have more leisure or to whom a mountain side, thick
wood, or sloppy marsh was not an obstacle to investigation. The
species are mostly Passerine because I am more interested in such
groups, but a few notes with reference to certain Picarian birds, Owls,
Hawks* Waders, Ducks, Gulls, etc., may not be out of the way.
I am inclined, however, to say without hesitation (eliminating
disappearing species like the Kite) that with the ordinary run of birds
their numbers are as good to-day as when I was a boy, and in some
cases a style of cultivation or game-preserving has apparently either
increased them or perhaps drawn them from elsewhere. The real
local extinction or " lessening " of a species (as apart from wholesale
slaughter by the gun for various reasons) I can, without exception,
trace solely to altered conditions of country, and wherever conditions
remain good, continual and reasonable toll of their numbers seems to
not affect them adversely. Since the days of Gilbert White people
have been more inclined to observe small items of this kind, and, of
course, that's (from a natural history standpoint) only yesterday !
In consequence we have much to learn, and we are often at a loss to
give any logical reason as to why a species removes itself to just over
the way, or w T hy it is apparently more common in a local area this
year than last. We sometimes forget that we are not everywhere
at once, and that the numbers of a species are as much affected by
incidents occurring during their absence from these shores as when
they are here, which is applicable to winter or summer birds or
such resident species as are migratory, and how many are not ?
Whatever we do we must not start reports because our personal
" luck is out " on a day's investigation, because, as before stated, we
can only draw impressions from the sum total of reports received
from competent observers who know their birds by ear and distance
as well as when they are under their noses.--Yours faithfully,

MAGPIE MOTH LARV/E (ABRAXAS GROSSU-
LARIATA) AS BIRD FOOD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9539887" page_id="10105298"  page_num="Page 203" year="" vol="">
Dear Dr. Renshaw, -- Dr. Collinge's observations on the
edibility of Abraxas grossulariata should prove exceedingly interesting
to Prof. Poulton and many others, who have always considered it
(upon almost overwhelming evidence) as one of the larva) most
generally avoided by European birds. *
On the other hand, another gooseberry caterpillar (Ilalia vauaria)
is freely eaten, and is a favourite food of the Titmice, as I have pointed
out previously.
If you offer the larvae of Abraxas to a frog, it licks it up at once,
and then the tongue is protruded to its utmost limit and the caterpillar
steps off and strides away unhurt. If you put one into a spider's web
the owner cuts away the surrounding threads and lets it drop out, or
if the web be funnel-shaped the spider retires to the back and lets the
caterpillar walk away. I have never known a lizard, a British bird,
or a fowl to devour a single specimen of this caterpillar, so that
Dr. Collinge's observations strike me as remarkable ; on the other hand,
Mr. Page says that his Weaver-birds devoured larva; of Abraxas, and
my Bluebirds, although they rejected the larvae, ate the perfect insect
with pleasure. -- Yours very sincerely,
A. G. Butler.

Sir, --The Brent Valley Bird Sanctuary of the Selborne Society
has been carried on for sixteen years, and apart from the experimental
work which has resulted in the sending of nesting boxes all over the
country and to different parts of the world, much pleasure has been
given to very numerous visitors of all classes. The Committee has,
until recently, been able to keep things going on the profits obtained
from the sale of nesting-boxes, together with occasional donations.
The War upset all arrangements, and turned the balance in
hand in 1914 into one due to the Secretary, so that it has been found
necessary to make an appeal for direct contributions. These may be
sent to me at " The Hermitage ", W. 7, together with orders for
nesting-boxes.
With a greatly increased amount of land under cultivation, and
in view of the Government's afforestation scheme, the need for
augmenting the number of insect-eating birds is manifest, and the
importance of bird sanctuaries is greater than ever.
Under these circumstances it may not be out of place to express
the hope that someone may come forward and put the Brent Valley

charming Woodpecker, too--ridiculously confident, exceedingly hand-
some, and delightfully tame. He is the Yellow-naped Woodpecker,
found in the Himalayas as far west as Masuri, extending into Assam
and Cachar, and ranging south into British Burmah as far as the
central portion of the province of Tenasserim. Dr. Jerdon recorded
that it is " found throughout the Himalayas, extending from Assam

2,000 to 6,000 feet
Describing his colouring roughly, let me explain that the upper
parts from nape of neck to tail are a uniform vivid glossy green.
Primaries, chestnut barred with black ; forehead, rufous brown ; sides
of head, dingy olive-brown ; chin and throat, lemon yellow, terminating
in black and white chequering ; chest, dull olive ; underparts, grey

with a dusty olive tinge ; thighs and under tail-coverts, washed with
yellow ; tail, black ; pointed nuchal crest, bright golden yellow ; bill,
bluish-white ; iris, red ; eyelids and naked skin at gape, greenish blue.
This Woodpecker is an inch longer than the common Green Wood-
pecker of England, etc. Gould terms it " this noble bird ".
My specimen, evidently hand-reared, delights in coming out of
his cage on to anyone's shoulder, where he plays a sort of peep-bo
from one side of one's head to the other, extending his long pink
tongue, which quiveringly tickles one's neck, ears, and even teeth if
one opens one's mouth.
He seems to delight in human companionship, chattering softly
at moments, and looking altogether fascinating and intelligent.
A young male. The female has a chestnut throat, where his is lemon
or butter yellow. Until he came to me I was not aware that Wood-
peckers greedily eat fruit. He digs into a pear or apple, extracting
large mouthfuls ; and wine-berries, blackberries, etc., are all welcomed.
Offer him some wasp-cake, and see his tongue flick out the grubs.
Most entertaining !
Never did I have a more charming pet, and I have had a good
many in my day. If he sang like a Shamah, he would be the perfect
bird; as it is, his notes up till now consist of a soft chattering, and also
a louder and melodious "chip ", if one whistles it.
BIRD-LIFp: IN 1918.

Thrushes.
Missel Thrush .--Has done well, many parties noticeable
everywhere.
Song Thrush .--Has " got over " the punishing of the 1916-17
frost, and had all my gooseberries in Suburbia. Quite as many every-
where as are needful.
Redwing .--Big flocks in Huntingdon, 1917-18, but did not see
so many in Suffolk and Essex myself.

Fieldfare .--Saw it here and there, but weather prevented me
going on low wet ground at the time I was in the country.
Blackbird .--Exceptionally strong everywhere. Is never " hit "
by the frost like a Song Thrush. Saw 1918 bird feed August nestlings
of the same year, apparently an earlier example from three broods
reared by a pair in my garden.
Ring Ouzel .--Have not been in its haunts, but have a report
to the effect that it came in usual numbers.
Redbreast .--As numerous as ever, bred early and late every-
where. More old birds seemed to survive moult and keep their
quarters this autumn than usual. Some seasons birds of the year shift
many of them.
Nightingale .--Good accounts from Kent, Surrey, Hunts, and
East Anglia. In Farnborough, Kent, a pair brought a flying brood
from a wood and fed them on a mould heap near potting shed in garden
for several days. Last year in same grounds a pair similarly conducted
a brood round pigsties and manure heap at almost same dates.
I heard this male on arrival, and he apparently settled and bred
in area.
Redstart .--Had good report in Ipswich district, and saw it here
(East Anglia), and as far west as the Wye and Conway.
Black Redstart .--Have had no report, and have been unable to
go where I expect it at a certain time. Saw last living wild specimen
not far from Dr. Butler's a few years ago. It remained there for
weeks.
Chats.
Wheatear .--Am afraid I shall be unable to get to Downs
country, where I usually see the return birds. Had accounts of its
vernal arrival in usual numbers.
Stonechat .--Winter resident birds were thinned in 1916-17.
Migratory birds, however, made this up. Saw a winter pair settled early
this spring, and recently (August) a cock and brood near New Cross on
some elevated waste.
Whinchat .--Moving alongside four-foot way disturbed birds in
one or two of my favourite spots. These shifted, but have not been
to where I can usually see them with moving broods. Local report
mentions them.

Warblers.
Garden Warbler. --Did not sing till rather late (1918). Saw it in
Kent and in suburban gardens for fruit, with Whitethroats. Turned
up in usual quantities and heard it in South Wales.
Blackcap. --Saw and heard cocks in Kent, East Anglia, and
Monmouthshire. Good accounts of it in usual spots.
Whitethroat.- --Good broods everywhere.
Lesser Whitethroat. --Plenty in such localities as favoured by it.
This, with its congener, went for raspberries rather painfully in South
London in July and August.
Grasshopper Warbler. --Heard it early in Kent, but was unable
to go where several pairs usually appear. Fine weather and trippers
were accountable for shifting it on a North Kent common, where it
always passes and stays in the spring.
Dartford Warbler. --One good neighbourhood has been spoiled
by fires and military necessities. Am not now in touch with a friend
in that district who has watched it annually.
Sedge Warbler. --Saw good broods with parents in Monmouth-
shire.
Reed Warbler. --Heard and saw it in South Wales, Hunts, and
Suffolk, and Essex border. As usual.
Marsh Warbler.- --Have not been where one might expect to
find it, and when near Ouse did not go on punt.
Willow Wren. --Should think it must exist in countless numbers
wherever it goes. Breeds right up to Suburbia. Courtship of this
species observed in Roehampton ; quite idiotic, but doubtless pleasing
to Willow Wrens.
Chiffchaff. --Noticed plenty early, and met with it almost
everywhere. Many strong broods noticeable in North and South
Wales.
Wood Wren. --Have been unable to visit my Surrey spots;
heard a few and saw this and its two congeners in one small hillside
wood in Monmouthshire.
Wrens and Oddments.
Wren. --Plentiful everywhere, bred early and late, many good
broods successfully dispersed.

Dipper .--Saw it in North and South Wales, but have not been
in its northern haunts.
Nuthatch .--Well distributed, and as common as usual both sides
of the island where I expected to find it. Pair bred in a suburban
district.
Creeper .--Have seen numbers in several counties, and several
strong broods ; no shortage as far as I can see, but can usually gauge
this better when they are on the shift.
Goldcrest .--Have been unable to go to spots where they are
thick in breeding season. Heard and saw singing cocks in nesting
season, and a brood party passed through an East Anglian garden this
week (August).
Tits.
Greater Tit .--Exceptionally numerous in early winter of 1917
in Suburbia, and very common elsewhere. Has teemed since young
have flown.
Blue Tit .--Much the same applies.
Coal Tit .--Numbers as usual in all respects. Apparently bred
near me in Suburbia, and when I have visited certain spots have met
latterly with numerous parties.
Marsh Tit .--Saw isolated pairs in Suffolk, Essex, and Monmouth.
Have no accounts this season of its nesting.
Longtailed Tit .--Saw it in winter of 1917-18 in certain localities
in usual numbers. An exceptional flock occurred during shooting
operations on an estate in East Anglia.
More Oddments.
Bearded Reedling .--Am not now in touch with any Broad people.
Hedge Accentor .--Excessively numerous, right up into Suburbia,
\yhere good broods appeared early and late. Before moult sets in this
species usually prevents a forlorn appearance, and I see more wild
Hedge-sparrows minus head feathers in the nesting-season than any
other bird I know.
Flycatchers, Shrikes, and Swallows.
Pied Flycatcher .--Prevented from following up such examples
as I have heard and seen. Put one hen out of a stone wall by roadside.

and saw another feed her brood in a quarry " shoot " wall. Tons of
dusty granite must have been trundled over this shoot hourly for
eight hours at a stretch, and apparently workmen did not notice the
brood. This bird behaves much like a Redstart.
Spotted Flycatcher.-- Numerous everywhere. Bred right into
Suburbia. "
Great Grey Shrikes. -- Heard of its occurrence in wide apart
localities during the winter.
Redbackecl Shrike. --Saw pairs at usual spots. Absent in
meadows and fences where hedges were trimmed, or where camps had
been instituted. This bird when rearing kills game up to the size of
a nestling Song Thrush. Have seen it impale a House Martin, and
have known it to attack small running game. The last pair I had, in
addition to eating a pot of food and plenty of cockroaches and beetles,
would in twenty-four hours spoil the look of a mouse or a Greenfinch.
Have picked up numbers of legs of Robins, Willow Wrens, White-
throats, etc., near an " abattoir ". Does not confine itself to bumble-
bees and beetles when young are hatched.
Swallow. --No scarcity wherever I have been. Broods very
strong and large. Saw an unquestionable bird of the year carrying
a feather to a chimney yesterday (August).

[Reprinted from the Wilson Bulletin, No. 90.]
One of the sp&amp;gt;ecies of birds frequently seen near the hotels was
the Indian Hoopoe ( Upupa indica). Both the manner of its flight
and the barred portion of its plumage were strong reminders of the
Woodpeckers. Immediately upon alighting its bright-coloured crest
is erected, and the same thing happens when the bird is frightened.
At other times the crest lies flat; the end of it projecting beyond the
head affords in outline a symmetrical balance to the long bill, making
the head resemble a double-pointed pickaxe. This semblance is

especially marked when the bird is digging for its living in the earth.
The sight of my first Hoopoe was a long anticipated event, and was of
unusual significance from the fact that it was the first foreign bird in
a free state to be met of which I had retained a mental picture from
my early childhood, or more correctly speaking, it was a mental picture
of a picture one found in the second book I owned. It was a book
then, a wonderful book, though now it would be called a tiny brochure
of twenty-four pages. Its title is A History of Birds for Children.
Its illustrated cover is wonderful ; still more so is its wood-cut
illustration of the Hoopoe, for it proves the theory of evolution. This
illustration shows that fifty-five or more years ago the Hoopoe was
a thick-set, thick-billed bird, resembling a Grosbeak, with a gently
curving crest becoming to the form and disposition of a Bluebird.
In the course of ten or twelve years the structure of the species had
undergone considerable change, which can be proved by the picture of
it that is to be found in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, edition
of 1870. And now in January, 1914, I find from the living birds seen
in India that in a structural sense vastly greater changes have taken
place within the last forty-five years. The bird at present, with its
short legs, long, sharp bill, and barred wings, looks somewhat like
a Woodpecker. In fact, some of the tourists insisted that it was a
Woodpecker.
One Golden-backed Woodpecker ( Brachypternus aurantius) was
the sole representative of the Picus family seen in India. With the
usual cheerful spirit that characterizes the family the world over it
searched tree-trunks and inspected the hood of an electric lamp on one
of the principal streets of Delhi.
Other species of birds found by me near the hotels more often
than elsewhere were the Bulbuls, the Babblers, Indian Tree-pie,
Common Indian Starling, Magpie Robin, Brown-backed Indian Robin,
Indian Redstart, Indian Tailor-bird, Flycatchers, Warblers, and
Purple Honeysucker. Some ornithologists prefer to call the last-
mentioned species the Purple Sunbird ( Arachnechthra asiatica). By
its quick movements among the flowers while seeking its food of insects
and nectar, as well as by its size and colour, it brought to mind the
Hummingbirds. Especially is this true of the male Sunbird, that is of

a rich, iridescent violet-blue colour, while the female as described is
greenish brown-grey above, and greenish yellow beneath. Both sexes
were seen, but the male more frequently.
The Red-whiskered Bulbul was seen and positively identified
a short distance from the entrance to the Caves of Elephanta ; on a
few other pccasions identification was not so certain. The Common
Bulbul was found in several places, but nowhere so plentiful as on
Mount Abu, where it appeared to be the most abundant species, even
outnumbering the Common Myna. These two species were the only
Bulbuls of which I made sure, although India boasts of fifty other
species of them ; and of Babblers there are eighty-three, of which
I saw but two, the Common or Striated Babble ( Argya caudata) and
the Jungle Babble (Crateropus canorus). The last-named species,
very inconspicuous in its ashy brown plumage, with its ground-haunting
proclivities, would not be so easy of identification as one might suppose,
if it were not for its habit of flocking in small parties of five, six, or
seven birds which affords a clue to their identity, confirmation o#
which may be had from almost any guide, since these birds are
commonly known to the natives by the very appropriate name of the
Seven Sisters, or the Seven Brothers.
The Indian Tree-pie (Dendrocitta rufa), a bird eighteen inches
in length, is certain to arrest one's attention by its pleasing display
of colours and its long tail. Its metallic whistle is fully as musical
as the call notes of the Bronzed Crackle, nor has it a better reputation,
since it is well known as a destroyer of both birds and their eggs.

PARRAKEETS.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
I have two hybrid Barraband (Polytelis barrabancli ) x Queen
Alexandra Parrakeets ( P. Alexandrce --nr as it was ridiculously named,
Spathopterus Alexandrce ; thereby separating this latter species from
its true genus of Polytelis, merely because the male happens to have

a spatulated feather on the third primary. The Queen Alexandra is
absolutely a Polytelis as much as is the Barraband and the Rock
Pebbler). At any rate, my male Barraband seemed to recognize
a close relation in a female Queen Alexandra which I reared last year,
1918. The result is two young ones, male and female, favouring the
father in colouring, but the colours are still those of nestlings. Later
on I hope to describe the adult bird.
The male is uniform bright green with a patch of orange-pink
at the base of the throat, and the same colour on the inner webs of
the tail.
The female has the tail of that colour, but not the throat, which
is green like the rest of her plumage. The mother wished to mate
with a bird of her own species who seems to be a confirmed celibate,
so she yielded to an earnest proposal from the Barraband, and the
result is what I suppose to be a unique hybrid. As yet there is no
indication of yellow or blue on the forehead of the male. That may
come later on. Which will it be ? Perhaps neither, but some
mixture.
[Mr. Astley writes on September 4 : "I regret greatly that
I have to send you the body of one of my hybrid Polytelis barrabandi X
P. Alexandra; Parrakeets. Both have died ! The bill was much
redder in life. I hope to have better luck another time.'&amp;quot;]

Some knowledge of elementary museum methods, if not actually
essential, is, at any rate, very helpful to the aviculturist; by which
term one designates, not the mere haphazard bird-fancier, who pursues
his hobby without plan or method, but the intelligent student of bird
life. Since in normal times we study the eggs and young of birds,
it follows that any method of preserving clear eggs, or any nestlings
that may die, is of the first importance. Only too often, it is to be

feared, have rare eggs or dead young ones been thrown away, merely
through ignorance of some method of retaining them for future study.
Eggs which it is desired to preserve should be emptied by
drilling with a steel drill a neat, hole in the centre of the egg, care
being taken to select a site free from conspicuous markings. A blow-
pijje of glass or metal having been inserted into the hole, the contents
are then neatly expelled by blowing down the tube, the white and yolk
streaming past the blow-pipe between the pipe and the rim of the hole.
The former barbarous method of making a hole at each end with
a pin often resulted in ruining the shape of the egg by damaging one
or both ends ; the later practice of making two holes at the side is
now also discarded in favour of the neat, one-hole method. After
blowing, the egg is allowed to become thoroughly dry before placing
in the cabinet; if this precaution is omitted, mould and mildew are
only too likely to appear on the shell. Before being put away the
egg should always be inscribed with the name of the bird and date of
laying. These details should be written on the egg itself, for labels
tend in time to become detached and lost.
Hard-sat eggs containing well-developed embryos may
occasionally come under the notice of the aviculturist. The hole
should be drilled at the side as before, and the egg put away for a day
or two to allow the embryo to soften ; it may then in many cases be
cautiously extracted after cutting it to pieces with fine curved scissors.
Obstinate cases may be injected with a solution of caustic potash,
the egg then being well shaken and left to stand for twelve hours ; it
is then again shaken, and the softened embryo blown out if possible
by the blow-pipe. If, however, the embryo is on the point of hatching,
and the egg is boldly marked, the shell may be carefully bisected with
a minute file, the embryo extracted, and the two half-shells neatly
gummed together ; if the filing has been carefully done the mark of
the union will be hardly noticeable on a richly spotted specimen. With
white eggs a good plan is either maceration by caustic potash or
embryotomy. The aviculturist may, however, prefer to place the
egg on an ants' nest. The ants will enter by the drill-hole, and in the
majority of cases end by completely emptying the shell. Hard, well-
formed bone will, however, resist their efforts.

Nestlings are readily preserved in methylated spirit; they soon
become hardened, and may be taken out for examination without
fear of tearing ; the eyes, it may be noted, become white under the
action of the spirit. All specimens should have a label with the name
of the species, together with the date of preservation and any other
useful details, attached to the bottle.
A NEW DOOR-LATCH.
By G. E. Low.
I suppose most bird-keepers have suffered at some time or other
through doors being carelessly left open, or unlatched. I remember
once losing a cock Melba Finch through the door blowing open on
a very windy day when I was in the aviary, although it was governed
by a spring.
I have found the device which is shown in the illustration quite
satisfactory, as it simply insists on shutting from any point. The
door must be fitted with an efficient spring or weight and pulley ;
the latch is made of hard wood, weighted at the inner end, and fixed
to the door post by a screw and washer, so as to swing easily. The
bar, which is fastened to the*door, slides lightly over the latch until
it engages in the notch. This latch may have been used in the Ark,
but its advantages are so obvious and its construction so simple that
I venture to suggest its use.
THE OOLOGISTS' EXCHANGE AND MART.
This little paper, first published on June 1, 1919, appears on
the first day of each month. With its advertisement supplement
it is issued privately to subscribers only and no specimen copies
or single parts can be sent out. Every effort is made to limit the
subscription list to thoroughly reliable collectors, and those who

The Oologists ' Exchange and Mart.
are not members of some scientific society of standing, and who
wish to become subscribers, are required to satisfy the Editor as
to their bona fides. The names and addresses of new subscribers
are published as they join, and a complete list will appear early in
the new year when subscriptions are renewed. No dealers in
natural history specimens are accepted as subscribers, as one of
the principal objects of the paper is the assistance of collectors in
securing specimens from each other at first hand without the
intervention of others.
As its title indicates, the paper deals exclusively with oology,
and though many ornithologists deprecate the collection of eggs,
the legitimate interests of the oologists can neither be denied nor
ignored, and the support already accorded to the paper shows that
it is appreciated. But while encouraging scientific oology in every
possible way, no effort is spared to protect the rarer British breeding
species and to discourage the random collection of eggs and the mere
accumulation of specimens.
Amongst the steadily growing list of subscribers are to be
found the names of many leading collectors both in this country
and in the U.S.A., as well as some few in France and in the Colonies.
This increasing support will permit of the gradual improvement of
the paper, until it becomes not only the recognized medium for the
purchase and exchange of eggs amongst oologists everywhere but also
a paper of much interest.
The subscription for the period ending December 31, 1919,
has been fixed at 4s., and this includes the right to a free 25-word
advertisement in the supplement, in which also extra words or extra
advertisements can be inserted at the rate of \d. per word. The
subscription for the whole of 1920 will probably be 5s.

Naturalists of a bygone day believed that in the course of development each
individual climbed up its own genealogical tree. The reconstruction of aviculture
exhibits somewhat similar characters, the old features reappearing one by one in
the Magazine. To-day the Editor takes pleasure in restoring the " notes " section

New Arrivals at the Zoo. --Lieut. Delacour most kindly
purchased for us in Paris a collection of Senegal Birds, and some
Cuban Finches, Olive Finches, and Yellow-winged Sugar-birds. He
also presented to the Zoo two Greenish Hangnests and a Yellow
Troupial. We had also a valuable present from Dr. Van Someren,
who brought us from East Africa a splendid Ross's Plantain-eater,
a Bare-faced Fruit Pigeon, and two Grant's Francolins.---D. Seth-
Smith.
New Arrivals at Brinsop Court. --Amongst the birds which accom-
panied my Yellow-naped Woodpecker (I did not keep them all !) were
a Bengal Pitta, a Rufous-bellied Blue Niltava, a White-crested Jay
Thrush, a Plumbeous Redstart, and a coal-black Redstart--which
latter resembles the European Black Redstart very closely, but the
black is really black, and the bird has chestnut about the thighs.
There was also an Orange-headed Ground-Thrush ( Geocichla citrina),
a female.-- H. D. Astley.

We have received from Mr. W. Leon Dawson the double number
(Nos. 1 and 2, vol. i) of the Journal of the Museum of Comparative
Oology, Santa Barbara, California. The Museum is devoted to the
study of the birds of the world, with especial reference to their nests
and eggs. It is a pioneer museum ; nothing at all approaching it
exists anywhere else. In these difficult times it is encouraging and
inspiriting to learn that a good start has already been made, and the
first official publication breathes a spirit of science, energy, and hopeful-
ness that makes us jmoud indeed of our American brothers, " not
cousins," as indeed Mr. Dawson says in his letter to us.
The Board of Visitors includes many names well known and
honoured on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Brooks, Bryant,
Chambers, Finley, Ridgway, and Shufeldt; an array of Fellows,
Patrons, Members, Patron Collectors, Field Members, Exchange
Collectors, Corresponding Members, and Authorized Collectors, marks
the thoroughness with which the well-wishers of the Museum have
been organized ; in the Journal we read of the building erected to
house the twenty thousand eggs already acquired, and of liberal, far-
reaching plans for the future. The illustrations are good, and give
an excellent idea of the Museum both internally and externally. The
ultimate intention is to provide some twenty-two buildings, fire and
earthquake proof, with top lighting and dry heating. There will be an
administration hall, a library, a lecture hall, and workrooms. Research
expeditions will ultimately be sent out to collect for the Museum.
At the present time the premises consist of a reception room
and an annexe, with a workroom. The cabinets consist of twenty-four
redwood cases, their space allotment being 473 drawers, all covered,
or intended to be covered, with glass. From the illustrations in the
Journal one can gather a faint idea of the riches of this Museum. The
"Roc" drawer contains a grand egg of the extinct giant Ostrich of

Madagascar, the Epyornis maximus. The Prairie Falcon drawer
contains seventeen sets of this interesting species. The ordinal drawer
is most instructive, showing as it does eggs of thirty living orders,
amongst which we readily distinguish the Ostrich, Emu, and Tinamou.
One readily endorses the statement on p. 7 : " We have set out to
accomplish something which has never been done before."
The Museum asks for further contributions of eggs ; all who
send specimens may rest assured that they are supporting a cause well
worth while, and that every egg will be utilized. It is a pleasure to
record that Mr. W. Leon Dawson, the Secretary of the Museum, has
now become a member of the Avicultural Society.

Dear Sir,-- The copy of the Avicultural Magazine gave me much
pleasure, not alone for the amiable and hopeful tone of its editorials)
but for the concrete information of bird-life which it furnished. For
example, Dr. Butter's articles on the Rhea and the Emu recited two
facts which are of immense inportance to a student of comparative
oology. Dr. Butter gave the incubating period of the Emu as from
fifty to sixty days, and that of the Rhea (Rhea americana) at thirty-one
days. This probably means that the Rhea is a more advanced type,
a more " evolved " bird than the Emu. If the hypotheses of our
Dr. Bergtold is correct the reduction in length of the incubating period
in birds is correlated with elevation of body (blood) temperature, and
this in turn with structural and taxonomic advancement. It w T ould
be interesting to know from Dr. Butter what the comparative blood
temperatures of the Rhea and the Emu family really are, and to see
whether Dr. Bergtold's theory is borne out in this instance. Both
are hardy birds and hail from hardy climes, so that the difference,
if any, would have phylogenetic rather than merely geographic
significance.
It occurs to me that Aviculture and Comparative Oology really
have much in common ; so much so that I am tempted to inquire

whether it might not be possible for the Museum of Comparative
Oology to serve aviculturists as a repository for eggs not required in
propagating. I can assure aviculturists that any carefully
authenticated egg material from British or Continental aviaries will be
warmly welcomed by the Museum of Comparative Oology, and
especially such as depart from the normal type, or which tend to vary
conceivably owing to captivity. The ultimate plans of the Museum
call for a well-equipped aviary. In this all circumstances attending
egg deposition, incubation, etc., will be carefully studied. In the
meantime, however, we shall be quite dependent upon volunteer
service in this important field.--Sincerely yours,
W. Leon Dawson.
[We hope that with the revival of aviculture which has already
set in our Members will be able to participate as suggested in enriching
the egg collections of the Museum of Oology. Mr. Dawson's address

THE WASHINGTON ZOOLOGICAL PARK.
Dear Dr. Renshaw, --This morning I consulted with my
friend, the Superintendent of our Zoo, and he at once responded
favourably. He will help me to secure photographs of any birds that
I may point out to him, and let me have prints of any of those they now
have on hand. I have a fine one of the Harpy Eagle that died a few
months ago, and I can readily secure others. When the pictures are
assembled I will get up some text for them and send the whole on to
you for publication.
We have some very famous American taxidermists now living
and actively at work, and I am sure you would be surprised to see
what they have accomplished here in the great museums. Several
of their groups are truly wonderful and masterpieces of their kind.--
Faithfully yours,
R. W. Shufeldt.

with pleasure to receiving the promised article.--G. R.]

I promised our Editor some long time ago to write him some
avicultural notes, and having been reminded by him that these were
long since due, I have sent him the following scraps, which I am afraid
are of no great interest, but we have hardly any birds here now to
write about. As with all other avicnlturists, our stock gradually
diminished during the War, either from natural causes or in some
cases from being disposed of owing to food difficulties. So far we
have not been able to replace them, though as I write I hear of several
large consignments from abroad being received by the dealers, so
that T have hopes of being able before long to fill up some of my empty
aviaries.
The few birds we have were all here five years ago, and are quite
old stagers. Amongst these the pair of Jackal Buzzards are still living,
and in perfect condition ; we have had them now since the winter of
1904, fifteen years ago, and they came to us from the Zoological Gardens,
where they had then not been a very long time. They look the picture
of health at present, and have nested here every year since we got
them, but on only one occasion were the young completely reared.
This was in 1906, though in the following year only an unlucky
accident killed the two young birds, which were then about three weeks
old. The nest has always been made in the same spot--a big, rather

untidy structure of sticks placed on a large platform in one corner
of the aviary, and in no way hidden from public view. More than
two eggs have never been laid at a time, except once when there was
some doubt about a third ! Several other young ones have been
hatched, but have always died, from some unexplained cause, before
they left the nest. For the last six years the eggs have not hatched
and have generally been clear, though the old birds have sat as well
as ever.
A full account of the breeding of this species has appeared in
Vol. V of the Avicultural Magazine, p. 57.
In the next aviary to the Jackal Buzzards is a South American
Caracara, a beautiful bird which I bought a good many years ago from
the late Mr. Jamrach. It lives a solitary life, having been guilty in
1908 of killing our old Common Buzzard, which we had had for twenty-
five years. For some reason which I cannot now remember the
Buzzard had been stupidly put into the Caracara's aviary, and after
a terrible fight the Buzzard was defeated and killed--needless to say
when no one was about to separate them. This was all the more to be
regretted, as it was in very good health, and had all the appearance
of living for another twenty-five years.
A Rufous Tinamou is the sole survivor of a large aviary once full
of birds. He is now monarch of all he surveys, and I wish I could
find a companion of some sort for him, as I am sure in many cases
certain birds mope when they are left for long alone. I was especially
struck by this in the case of my White-crested Touracoes. The hen
had died, and for a long time the male bird was all alone in a large
outdoor aviary. He appeared lethargic and moped, which was altogether
wrong for such a very active bird, always on the move in his native
woods in Central Africa. However, on my putting a few small foreign
Finches into the aviary with him he quickly regained his spirits and
appeared to enjoy life once more. But to return to the Rufous
Tinamou ; he is one of a pair I received from a dealer in 1910, so he is
no longer young. I have never bred this species, though eggs were
laid. My bird is now quite bald on the top of his head, I suppose
from old age, but otherwise is in good fettle. Though fed on grain and
some green food he is constantly digging in the ground, and devours

earthworms and beetles, when given to him, with the greatest avidity.
He is a silent bird, except when he is frightened, when he utters a single
loud and very musical alarm note.
During the War we did not breed any Rheas here, and my flock of
five remained as they were. This year two nests, if nests they can be
called, were made, and nine and eleven eggs respectively laid, but for
some reason or other the cocks refused to sit. A wet, cold spell came
on just when they were about to commence sitting, which may have
had something to do with it; or they may have had too many visitors.
The latter is, I am afraid, the true explanation. However, the eggs
were not wasted, as I sold them, with their contents, in August at a
jumble sale here for sixpence apiece ; but I daresay they were rather
stale to eat then, as they had been lying in the open field since the
middle of June ! Rheas' eggs when fresh are not at all bad, and
make quite good omelettes.
A varied collection&amp;apos; of Ducks, of many different species, mostly
widows and widowers, completes my present meagre list of our birds ;
but I hope that next time I write anything for the Magazine I shall
have a different tale to tell, and that our aviaries will be restocked,
and in something like pre-War condition.

Bright autumn days set birds singing and calling in a manner very
pleasant to listen to. It is quite a mistake to think that birds' songs
are restricted to spring and early summer, though naturally that is the
time when the choir is complete and the various choristers are in their
best voice. First among autumn songsters is the Robin, whose ruddy
breast glows among the fading leafage. Everywhere we go there are
Robins singing. Sunny September days set the larks trilling and
carolling in the sky in a way that recalls spring. Thrushes sing a little
just now, in a whispered sort of way, but their voices will improve-
In wooded gardens of quiet suburbs round Manchester they are heard
throughout mild winters. The Wren is the most irrepressible of birds,
and to-day it is gaily vocal in the dingles, as though spring were nigh.

About the garden beds Hedge-sparrows utter their piping note, and
now and then they sing. The " Dunnock ", to use a homely name,
sings well in late autumn and winter ; starlings cheerily whistle and
sing on the chimneys. The autumn melody of the Chaffinch is always
uncertain ; some years we hear it frequently, while other years we
miss it altogether. The bluff and stirring voice of the Mistle Thrush
is heard as the year grows old. Occasionally the Yellow-hammer
sings a little in late autumn. The Blackbird rarely carols in autumn
and winter--at any rate, in Lancashire and Cheshire.
Apart from actual song, fine autumn weather sets many birds
calling and twittering. Finches of various kinds have much to say,
and they say it among the breezy fields when seeking food among
the seeds of weeds. There is the whispering of Tits and other small
fry in the woods, the wild notes of Lapwings in open places, and the
clamour of Rooks and Daws. Many birds are in flocks, which makes
the scene more animated and enjoyable to witness.

The following account of an attempt I made to keep Budgerigars
in a small outdoor aviary may perhaps not be entirely void of interest
to some of our Members. It is more a record of failure than success,
but I am by no means discouraged and intend to keep on trying.
My aviary (if I may describe it as such) consists of a roosting-shed
and a small flight enclosure of wire-netting, except half of the roof,
which is wood. The dimensions are as follows : Roosting-shed, height
at back 6 ft. 6 in., height at front 5 ft. 5 in., length from back to front
5 ft. 3 in., width 3 ft. ; flight enclosure, length 4 ft. 6 in., width 3 ft.,
height at back 4 ft. 6 in., height at front 3 ft. 8 in. The roosting-shed
is of wood, well felted and tarred outside, distempered inside, and is
free from draughts. It has always had, however, an odour of dampness
inside, for which I can in no way account.
For the past few years I have kept a pair of Budgerigars in this
place at a time. After the birds had been in for a week or two they
seemed to make a kind of sneezing noise. I lost three hens at different

times. The cock birds seemed to do better, but I lost one of
them also.
Once I had a nest of three fine youngsters, but the hen bird died
when the oldest young one was ready to leave the nest, and it alone
survived. A few days before the hen died she made the sneezing
noise violently.
Of the pair of birds at present in my possession the hen has been
in the place over a year and the cock a few months. Both birds sneeze
slightly at long intervals, not, however, as much as the former ones did.
I think this is in some measure due to a ventilation slit that I made in
the back of the roosting-shed and near the roof.
Until next spring I am having my present pair of birds indoors.
By that time I intend to have a better place got ready for them in
the garden, and of course larger than the first, although I am not
over-burdened with space. One of the chief disadvantages I have to
contend with is the absence of a high wall to build against.
Probably some of your readers may care to give a suggestion
regarding the proportions of a small garden aviary for Budgerigars.

Kingfisher .--Found it in usual places, and seldom visit spots in
Hunts, Suffolk, and Essex without hearing it the moment I arrive at
its quarters. Has never varied in its numbers where I know it, except
just during severe frosts. Even then it attacks a roving member of
its kind should it come near its haunts.

" Woodcock Owl ".
Little Out .--Hear and see it everywhere. Has become a real
nuisance, and attacks things by day as well as by night. Saw one
catching " Midsummer dors " outside railway station in Hunts the
other evening. Hear it all over Suffolk and Essex. Very noisy two
nights ago here. Intelligent farmer who preserves in a small way had
seven adult Pheasants blinded and eventually killed by one. These
were penned, and for a time the culprit was a mystery because they
knew nothing larger than a Little Owl could get through such apertures
as occurred in the rough wood and wire enclosure. They watched it
go for the remaining bird, a cock, and terrify it until the bird tried
to hide.
Sparrow-hawk .--Saw it here and there. Has been shot at when
sitting every year in most of the localities I visit, and has much difficulty
in rearing its broods. Has had a better time lately.
Kestrel .--Numerous everywhere. Have seen it from time to time
in suburbs. Good broods got away this season, and saw six migrant
Kestrels sitting on tops of scrub bushes in a meadow recently. These
are usually birds of the year, and very tame. One pair I knew of
this season was responsible for the loss of 150 chicks. Although l can
hardly credit it, the parent birds apparently accidentally flushed a Wild
Duck, which, as she flew off, banged down on to the nest : the Kestrels
were seen carrying off Ducks ' eggs. The owner of the property waited
and watched to make sure when he heard of this, and got up the tree to see
if such was actually the case. Egg shells and remnants of ducklings were
found. This was the first case of its kind I have met with, and I was
especially introduced to the gentleman in order to question him myself.
Shelduck .--Saw big broods in Conway, and old birds in good
quantity.
Mallard .--Numerous on wing early in evening now ; has bred
undisturbed in good numbers. Dined to-day off excellent flapper.

and recently observed an example plough its way up Thames between
the Tower and London Bridge.
Gulls. --Have only been to one breeding-spot, and saw six species.
During the last few days they are conspicuous over the stubbles in this
district, apparently engaged in catching winged ants, after the manner
of the Sparrow and Starling.

Regularity in Moulting. --It is interesting to note with what
regularity birds shed their feathers. In April, 1915, I obtained a cock
Alexandrine Parrot, and have kept a record of the shedding each year
of his two longest tail feathers. The accompanying table shows that
the moult becomes slightly later each year--whether this is due to
weather conditions or food I do not know--it also shows that the
feathers become slightly longer each year. It also indicates that the
left feather is always the longer, and is generally shed first [this is so
with this particular bird, but in another cock Alexandrine 1 had it was
the right feather that was always the longer]. For seven years I also
possessed a Shama, whose tail became longer as he grew older. When
he first came to me the longest tail feather at moult was 4 |inches ; at
the time of his death it was 6 inches. May it be possible in this way
to tell the age of a bird ?--

Mould in Collections of Eggs. -- I have no doubt that lack of

A Tame Seagull. --A tame Seagull used to live in a garden not far

calling while a fish was being caught for him. He was quite tame,
and great friends with the lad and dogs. His wing had been broken
at some time, and as he could not fly he resigned himself to his fate,
and became very attached to his owner. I am sorry to say he has
gone the way of all pets and is much missed.-- Eileen Staveley-Hill.

Bird Behaviour : Psychical and Physiological. By Frank Finn.
]ip. x, 363, with 44 illustrations. London : Hutchinson &amp; Co.
1919. Price Is. 6d.
The widespread and growing interest in bird-life, which is such
a pleasant feature of the times, will ensure for this work a favourable
reception, and it deserves it, for the author has brought together an
amount of facts that is truly surprising, and in spite of a somewhat
loose arrangement of the subject-matter his work is full of interest.
Whilst fully agreeing with Mr. Finn's remarks upon the attitude
displayed by many zoologists towards the study of birds, ornithologists
we feel have themselves largely to blame; for in the past, and to a much
lesser degree at present, they have been content with the publication
of dull and uninteresting local lists, or absorbed in recording local and
other rarities. There are other sides of bird-life much more important,
as the author recognizes, and the ways and habits and general behaviour
of birds are, to my mind, not only of greater importance but much
more interesting.
To some of Mr. Finn's statements we can hardly subscribe, e.g.
he writes, " taking the class of birds as a whole, a beautiful bird
never lays a beautiful egg, and vice versci." How about the Chaffinch,

Bullfinch, Jay, and many of the Hawks &amp;apos;( These are all certainly
very beautiful birds and they lay very beautiful eggs, both as regards
shape and colour markings.
If the book has a fault it is that it is overburdened with instances
of curious behaviour and habit with little or no explanation. This is
a pity, for often a line or two would have proved very valuable.
Nevertheless, in spite of these minor drawbacks, and they are
nothing more, Mr. Finn has presented us with a work that must arrest
the attention of the most casual student of bird-life, and leave him with
a bushel of queries to solve, whilst to all those who delight in the study
of living zoology it contains a wealth of matter sufficient to keep the
most energetic busy.
The illustrations are excellent, but the index is very incomplete.
The publishers are at fault in neglecting to place a date of the year
of publication on the title-page.

Mr. Gladstone has done good service to bird-lovers and to naturalists
in collecting and arranging the information available regarding the
relation of birds to war and of war to bird-life. The value of the
collection will increase with the years, for much of it has been gathered
from jottings and newspaper-cuttings which otherwise would soon have
been lost to memory. It affords a strange medley of fact and fiction.
Bird-breeders will be interested to read how faithfully Homing
Pigeons served the Army and Navy as messengers, and how Canaries
were used for the purpose of giving warning of a hostile gas attack.
Some economic faddists will be astounded to read again in the cold
light of post-War reason their own rash suggestions for the destruction
or exploitation of bird-life. Naturalists will learn of the delicacy of
the senses of birds, which enabled them to give early warning of air-
raids and of distant bombardment; of the effect of the W ar upon
migration and nesting habits ; and of the behaviour of birds in w r ar
areas. Inventors may admire the ingenuity of the gentleman who

suggested the training of Cormorants so that they might fly to the
attack and destruction of the munition works of the notorious Krupp.
There is some gold in newspaper cuttings, but there is much
ornithological dross ; yet even this Mr. Gladstone has wisely retained,
for behind the strange suggestions of letters to the Press we see an
epitome of war feelings, of the panic of ignorant minds vvho, losing
faith in themselves, trusted to the birds to see them through.

This fine work must surely by now have become an avicultural
classic ; once more, on receipt of the fourth instalment, we recognize
all the features which made the previous sections so delightful. The
present number deals with Wagtails, Creepers, Tits, Goldcrests, and
Shrikes ; it is again adorned with two fine plates from the magic
hand of Mr. Gronvold. To praise these is almost an impertinence ;
suffice it to say that they are indeed worthy of the artist, for we can
almost see the Titmice move, and hear their cry " Teacher ! teacher !
teacher ! " as we examine them in the coloured plate opposite p. 232.
In the letterpress the oologist will find a valuable hint (p. 217) in
diagnosing the eggs of the British Tree-creeper, while the stout
workmanlike beak of the Nuthatch is well rendered on p. 222.
It is unfortunate that the authors in their zeal for nomenclature
do not adopt a uniform standard of spelling ; thus we find " briffanica "
on p. 214 and " brhamdea " on p. 233. The beak of the Creeper on
p. 215 is much too feeble.

PATAGONIAN CONURES AND RED-BILLED
WEAVERS

<bodyText confidence="0.992397678571428" page_id="10105335"  page_num="Page 234" year="" vol="">
Dear Dr. Renshaw, -- I wonder whether any of our members
could tell me the name of some parrots I purchased recently in London.
I bought them as Patagonian Conures. Two of them are certainly
C. patagonicus, but the other two are much larger and vary considerably
in colour. I am wondering whether they can be C. bgroni. Mr. Seth-
Smith, in his book on Parrots, tells us that the larger Patagonian
Conure differs from the lesser only in size, one measuring 20 inches
and the other only 17J inches. My birds vary very considerably,
or at least one of them does (the other is nearly bare of feathers).
Upper parts of C. patagonicus , dark olive green ; in the larger bird
these are bright grass-green ; C. patagonicus has its throat and breast
greyish-brown, lower back and abdomen yellow, with a red patch on
lower abdomen and thighs ; all these parts in the larger bird are green ;
primary coverts and quills of the smaller bird are blue, and in the
larger bird green. According to Smith there is a band of white across
the upper part of the breast, which is more pronounced in the larger
bird. I cannot see this in either variety. The bill of the Lesser
Patagonian is nearly black, the upper mandible of the other is white.
Tins bird very closely resembles the Blue-crowned Conure (C.
hcemorrhous), but is, of course, very much larger, the latter only
measuring 13 inches.
Can any of our members tell me if they have ever come across
any cases of- melanism in the Red-billed Weaver ( Quelea quelea) ?
I have kept this species for many years, and had never seen an abnormal
specimen until last week, when in one of the big stores I spotted four.
One of these is black, with a small patch of yellow on the abdomen,
beak bright yellow ; another is black, with more or less chocolate and
buff on the breast and lower parts, beak coral red ; the third is dark-

brown, with a black head and yellow bill; the fourth dark-chocolate,
with brown wings and also a yellow beak. Isn't this rather unusual ?
W. Shore-Baily.
Dr. Butler writes : " If Mr. Shore-Baily's larger Conures are the
size of Cyanolyscus byroni I am afraid I am not well enough acquainted
with the Psittacidae to help him ; a total length of 20 inches is
exceptional among the Conures. Ilis observation that it ' very closely
resembles the Blue-crowned Conure ( C . hcemorrhous), but is, of course,
very much larger ', as also the fact that its upper mandible is white,
made me wonder at first whether it might be Conurus acuticaudatus,
only the latter bird is distinctly smaller than the Lesser Patagonian
Conure. Some years ago a male Red-billed Weaver was given to me
with an unusual amount of black in its plumage, but at its autumn
moult it became quite normal in colouring, which was disappointing.
Varieties of Quelea quelea, with the exception of the albinistic form
(Q. russi), have not often come my way ; but, if I remember rightly,
there are several among the skins in the collection at the Natural
History Museum (South Kensington). Of course, Mr. Shore-Baily
is aware that the yellow-billed examples are females, the red males.
In vigorous birds like the Weavers melanism frequently develops with
old age. Q. russi seems to be an exception to this rule, if I am correct
in supposing that the assumption of buff in place of black on the head
is albinistic, or of the same character as lutinism in Parrots. It un-
doubtedly appears in birds of advanced age, and may indicate delicacy
of constitution in a stock usually long-lived and vigorous. In really
delicate birds, like the C&amp;apos;ordon-bleu, old age tends to develop albinism,
a white speculum, which grows larger at each moult, appearing upon
the wings. The Weavers undoubtedly are only varieties of Q. quelea ;
there is no other species which they approach in character."
Mr. Seth-Smith writes : " I don't know what these Conures can be,
but suspect that C. byroni and C. patayonicus grade into one another,
and that these may be intermediate. There is only one way to make
certain, and that is to take them to the Natural History Museum and
compare them with the series there. Cases of melanism or partial
melanism in Quelea quelea are not common in captive birds."

Sir,-- In the August, 1919, number of your Magazine there is an
article on the above subject by Major Seppings which I cannot allow
to go unchallenged. Inter alia, he says that the National Zoological
Gardens at Pretoria have a good collection of birds (like Turban), but
that he did not see anything of outstanding interest. It is a pity
Major Seppings did not call for me at my office, or appeal to the bird-
keeper, when he would have been shown a truly remarkable collection
of South African birds of prey accommodated in a series of aviaries
from 12 feet to 18 feet high by over 200 feet in length. We have no
less than ten species of Eagles, including a pair of the magnificent
Yerreaux' Eagle, a fine collection of the South African Vultures (six
species), all the Kestrels, and at least a dozen other species of Hawks.
Our collection of South African game-birds is also very fine, including
six species of Francolin, three of Korhaan, one Paauw, four Guinea-
fowl, and some twelve species of Ducks and Geese.
Our Picarian birds are also representative, including three species of
Lourie,* two Rollers, five Hornbills, etc. I can only imagine that Major
Seppings either visited the Gardens near midday, when nearly every
form of bird-life is hidden in cover, or that his tour was very hasty.
As regards his statement that Pretoria is a very birdless town, I do
not quite comprehend his meaning. If he refers to the streets, then he
is quite correct, but I have never seen many birds in streets. Some
years ago I published a very considerable list of the wild birds found
in the Zoo, and I could nearly double that list to-day. The fountains
are full of bird-life, and in almost every garden you will find, besides
the species enumerated by Major Seppings, the Bakbakiri and Fiskal
Shrikes, Sunbirds of various species, and Finches and Seedeaters,
besides an occasional Thrush and some Waxbill.
I trust that Major Seppings will favour me with a call on his next
visit, and I will endeavour to show him some birddife.

BIRD PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE ZOO

By W. S. Berridge, F.Z.S.
The Zoo is a veritable paradise for the photographer--birds, beasts,
reptiles, fish, and insects from all parts of the world being found within
its precincts. With such an array of subjects at hand the camera
enthusiast cannot fail to find something to his liking, but as the writer
has been asked to contribute to a Magazine devoted to the study of
birds it will be as well for him to confine his remarks to avian fauna.
Although the late Lord Leighton designated photography a joe-
to-graphic art, there can be no gainsaying that it has made vast strides
during the last few years. Colour photography and rapid work, enabling
one to obtain records of birds in flight and during display, cannot but
afford valuable object lessons to the Nature student, even if, as is often
the case, the photographs fall short of high art. The writer is of opinion
that bird portrayal is by far the most difficult of all branches of
natural history photography, the restless and nervous disposition of most
feathered folk rendering them extremely difficult subjects to deal
with. Then, again, so many are endowed with very brilliant plumage--
bi'ight yellows and reds being especially difficult colours to render in
their true tone values, although, to a certain extent, the task can be
simplified by making use of colour-sensitive plates.
Another difficulty to contend against is that so many birds are of
such small proportions that it is necessary to be within a few feet of

them in order to procure a picture of any appreciable size. Under
such circumstances the depth of focus (i.e. the portion of the picture
that is sharply focussed) of even the best lens is but a few inches, and
although this state of affairs can be partly remedied by stopping down
the lens, yet this results in a reduced illuminating power when it is
the most required--for the nearer one is to an object the greater amount
of light and exposure is necessary in order to obtain successful results.
Although, as previously stated, shyness and timidity renders so
many birds difficult subjects for the photographer, yet, on the other
hand, extreme tameness maybe a cause of embarrassment. The writer
well remembers attempting to take a picture of a Brazilian Hangnest or
Troupial at the Zoo. The bird was of such a confiding nature that as
soon as the photographer entered the cage the sitter greeted him in
the heartiest manner--perching upon his head, then hopping upon
the camera, and with head craned forward examining the quality of the
lens with a most critical air. To make matters even more hopeless the
bird finally vanished up the sleeve of the operator's coat!
Visitors to the Zoo are usually very much interested in the doings
of a photographer, the more youthful members of the community
generally endeavouring to be included in the picture, while the adults
content themselves by remarking " doesn&amp;apos;t it seem to know it is having
its picture taken ! "*
Many people fail to understand how it is possible to take a photo-
graph of a bird or other creature through the wire meshing of a cage-
front without the strands appearing in the picture. The explanation
of this seemingly difficult problem is that when the lens is held quite
close to the wires and an object focussed some distance beyond, the
wires are thrown out of focus and do not appear in the image, although,
of course, it must be understood that they must not be too thick,
otherwise they would stop all light from passing through the lens.
Although many interesting bird studies are to be procured at the
Zoo throughout the year, the spring-time is possibly the best of all.
Not only is the light better at that period, but the majority of the

manner. The Ruff is another bird whose antics are well w r orth recording
by a series of photographs taken during his love-sick days, for few
birds indulge in such comical postures when courting. Then, again,
one cannot resist expending a few plates upon the Peacock, for he is
of a most accommodating disposition when displaying, turning first
one way and then the other in the most obliging manner.
From the writer's experience it would appear that the majority
of birds are far less shy of man during the mating season than at other
times. The males seem to be so overcome by their amorous emotions
that it is often possible to ajiproach to within a few feet without dis-
turbing them, although it must be remembered that certain species,
such as Swans and Ostriches, are liable to resent intrusion upon their
domestic affairs in a manner that commands respect.
THE BREEDING OF MY KAGUS, AEE BUT--
By an Old Australian Bird-lover
Readers of the Avicultural Magazine may not remember the mention
of my Kagus in this paper. I will therefore introduce them once more :
.Tames, now about ten years with me, and Mary, his wife, seven years.
Both are exceptionally tame, and will always meet me whenever
I come into their compound, displaying for me whenever I wish. They
are real pets and don't mind strangers, unless they have bare feet or
tan boots; they hate boys, whom they invariably attack. I had housed
the Kagus in an enclosure 100 by 50 feet, planted with shrubs and trees,
thinking this residence an ideal one for them to raise a family in. They,
however, deemed otherwise, and for years made no attempt at breeding.
My friend Mr. Waxman, living near me. has also a pair, which he houses
in a small enclosure with a shelter-shed. His birds repeatedly laid
in a cask which happened to be on the floor of the shed, but unfor-
tunately the chicks always died on leaving the shell; it seemed as if
they hatched before their time. Another gentleman who possesses

several pairs has the same experience regularly. Turning this pro-
position over in my mind, I came to the conclusion that the birds
require more than a shrubbery and a large run for breeding. I therefore
removed them to an extensive lawn and gave them a cask, the open
side of which I turned to a wall, allowing the birds just room to go in
and out. They very soon made this cask their sleeping-place, and
when I saw a great intimacy between the pair after they had been about
six months in their new surroundings my hopes ran high.
I was not disapjminted, for missing the hen one day I saw her
sitting in the cask, but no egg. Looking into the cask next morning
(September 4) I found she had laid her egg--they only lay one--and was
incubating it right away. The birds had no objection to my fondling it.
In size it resembled a fowl's egg, but in shape it was almost round.
It is a very striking egg in shape and colour. The ground tint is very
light stone, marked with a profusion of chocolate-gold blotches, the
remarkable thing being that part of the blotches appear to be on the
underside of the shell (or inside, if you like), and that one only sees
them transparent, which, however, is not so. The size of the spots
varies from little dots to the size of a grain of wdieat, longish and
mostly angulated. Of course, when I found that the birds were sitting
I removed all other inmates off this lawn, not that I feared that
the Kagus might become aggressive, but because I was afraid the
Seagulls, Plovers, Ducks, Curlews, or Magpies might take a liking to
the egg. The incubation was done alternately between the male and
female, and I never saw the egg left alone.
On October 5, after thirty-two days of incubation, the young
hatched-- to the delight and joy of the whole household, for they are
great favourites with us. Like the egg I could remove the young and
inspect it without interference from the old ones. Its colour was the
reverse of the shell, in shape it resembled a young Lyre Bird. Its
ground colour, on a peculiar furry down, was chocolate, in parts shading
to black. Along the back-bone and on each side of the flanks ran light
stone, i-in. wide stripes. The head was exceptionally large and flat,
the crown of it like the body, chocolate with light stone gold stripes.
Eyes black and glossy, bill grey and short and peculiarly blunt. I may
say that the sexes of these birds can only be decided by the colour of

their eyes--those of the male possess an additional brownish-orange
ring which the female lacks. (With the Mopokes it is the same.) The
bill of the old Kagus is of a dirty orange colour, and very long, sharp,
and powerful. In hunting for their food they have a habit of tapping
the ground with their foot to make sure by sound or touch--it would
be interesting to know which--where the worm really is, and then
unerringly penetrate this spot in the ground to 3 or 4 inches to extract
the worm.
The first day after hatching no food whatever was taken, but I
noticed that the male bird fed the chick in the cask on the second
day with what I took to be a very hard-skinned grub. I had given them
besides their larvae the run of my orchard, an area of about two acres,
so that plenty of natural food was assured ; but even so I fed them
with earth-worms and raw beef cut into narrow strips. On the third
day the chick left its nest--which, by the way, only consisted of a few
leaves--and came out to have a suit bath, afterwards running in again.
I feared for it the first few days as the weather was very cold and
changeable, but it never minded it in the least. From the second day
onward the baby emitted a peculiar whining noise, just like a Lyre
Bird. In feeding it the parent would dangle a worm or whatever it
had in front of its bill. The baby would then grab the bait and jerk
it in, feeding just like the parents. Often the young one would allow
the parent to wait four or five minutes and more before it was pleased
to take the food, the old bird all the time trying to coax it by making
a clucking sort of noise. Whenever the chick moved about, the mother
would follow it--quite unlike other baby birds, which seem to follow
their parents or come to their call--it seemed a real little tyrant.
After the chick was a week old it used to run in and out of the cask,
often going right away from it, the old birds then feeding it on raw
beef, snails, worms, and grubs. It had grown well and seemed to
thrive rapidly. It was just a fortnight old when one morning I could
not hear its whine. I thought a bush-rat might have taken it, but
looking into the cask I saw it there. Taking it out it breathed its last
in my hand. Sadly I looked down on its little body, which had given
me such pleasure and created so much interest. It is now in the Sydney
Museum, where in dissecting it we found that the parents had fed it with

one of the large white earth grubs, the larvae of a beetle plentiful about
here. It was the size and thickness of a big finger, and with its powerful
pincers had bitten into the throat of the baby Kagu and so caused
its death.
If I am lucky enough to escape the "flu" and other ills and my
birds keep well I hope to be able to tell a more satisfactory story of
the breeding of the Kagu next year.

There is no difficulty in breeding these birds provided that you have,
as Mr. Seth-Smith says, " a good-sized outdoor aviary. Here some
half-dozen or so pairs will produce anything up to a hundred young
in the course of a year."
Gregarious birds like Budgerigars breed most readily in aviaries
sufficiently large to accommodate several pairs without crowding,
but they should be provided with a choice of breeding receptacles,
exceeding the pairs of birds in number so as to avoid disputes. It is
possible to breed Budgerigars in indoor aviaries, or even in attics if
large enough to give the birds plenty of exercise ; but undoubtedly
the best results are obtained in outdoor aviaries with covered-in and
draught-proof retiring compartments, against the walls of which the
nesting receptacles should be fixed. Being very active birds exercise
is necessary to keep them in vigorous health, therefore the larger the
aviary the better for the birds. An enclosure which is only 3 feet wide
and the height of which ranges from 5 ft. 5 in. to 6 ft. 6 in. hardly gives
even one pair a fair chance, and in my opinion three pairs at least
should be kept together if one wishes to breed these birds successfully.
When nesting stale bread soaked in water and then pressed as dry
as possible in a cloth should be given in addition to the usual seeds ;
the latter should consist of canary or canary and millet. I found that
a slight admixture of oats was also acceptable.
I bred Budgerigars some years ago, but in an indoor aviary, and the
foolish creatures selected the winter (their proper breeding season,
I suppose) in which to increase and multiply. The result was that the
young were more delicate than they otherwise would have been.

NOTES ON THE BIRDS OE THE
BALEARIC ISLANDS

The following observations on the birds of some of the islands of
the Balearic group are, 1 fear, far from complete. They are the
result of a few weeks' rather hurried trip to the Islands of Mallorca,
Iviza, and Formentera. The Island of Menorca we did not have time
to visit. Short and incomplete as these notes are, I think they will
show that there is plenty of work to be done by an ornithologist in
all these islands, which in the month of April at all events swarm with
small birds.
Arriving at Palma, the capital of Mallorca, on April 1 my com-
panion, Mr. H. Willford, and I went by train to the town of Puebla,
and thence by diligence to the port of Alcudia, which is in a large bay
at the extreme north-east corner of the island. The country here
consists of marshes with stunted pines, shrubs, and clumps of coarse
ground, and close to the sea-shore rough sandy land ; then cultivated
land, mostly walled orchards of vines, almonds, and olive-trees.
Further inland we come to the montana-- steep, stony, littered,
uncultivated hills covered with pines.
We stayed altogether eight days at Alcudia, and then returned
to Palma and took a steamer to Iviza, the capital of the island of the
same name, a voyage of some 70 miles ; Iviza lying about half-way
between Mallorca and the Spanish port of Alicante. While in Iviza
we spent six days at the delightful village of Santa Eulalia, on the
east coast. This place was unique in having a stream of fresh water,
which I think accounted for the large number of birds found there.
The last island to be visited was Formentera, about 10 miles in
length, and 18 south of Iviza ; it is dead flat except at the south-east
end, which has a high hill covered with big trees. A good deal of
corn is still cultivated, from which the island got its name.
We only had time for three days here, and, as I was ill half the
while, I did not have many opportunities of collecting birds; but from
what we saw I think that probably Formentera would prove the most

rewarding of the three islands from the point of view of migration.
During the whole of our visit there seemed to be a large amount of
migration going on, especially of Warblers and Wagtails. The only
birds nesting were two pairs of .Kestrels ; one in the wall of our
" fonda " at St. Eulalia. All the Fringillidae were in full song, but of
the Sylviidse only the Blackcaps. The whole country was exceedingly
dry, and was supplied by innumerable wells ; the water is pumped up
by means of a primitive wheel turned by donkeys or cattle. Lastly,
I must mention that the inhabitants are, without exception, hospitable
and courteous, and allowed us to go where we liked and do what we
wished, although their usual politeness gave way to laughter when
they discovered me setting traps for Field-Mice.
Great care has to be taken when out collecting birds; the whole
country except the marshes and hills is highly cultivated, and it is
very difficult sometimes to see if anybody is working behind the bush
or hedge which contains the bird you particularly wish to procure.
Owing to this a few birds I should liked to have got for identification
had to be allowed to escape. To study the birds of this group com-
pletely would necessitate at least two years' residence in the islands;
or several visits in the spring and autumn should be undertaken if
" migration " is the principal object of investigation.
It had always struck me from studying the map of Western Europe
that the Balearic group would prove to be a good place to watch bird
migration, and my hurried journey of three weeks confirmed this
belief. Unfortunately the War prevented me going again, and now,
when I should like to continue and complete the work 1 commenced
in 1914, circumstances prevent me from doing so.
It is surprising to me that these very accessible islands have been
so long neglected by ornithologists ; but it appears that this neglect is
now over, as Mr. H. F. Witherby has been there this summer, and I hear
of several other ornithologists who are making arrangements to go
there shortly.
I have to thank Mr. Ogilvie-Grant for kindly looking over the
sixty-five skins I brought back, and Mr. David Bannerman for revising
these notes from material in the Natural History Museum. Some of
the specimens are still under examination by Mr. Bannerman at the

Every aviculturist, of course, knows that most birds with scarlet
feathers or a colour of which scarlet would be a component part, like
orange, will lose it altogether during the first moult, or at least change
the red to shades ranging down from yellow to a dirty pink or creamy
white. In seed-eaters we have the Linnet, which loses the carmine
entirely ; the Red Cardinal's glorious blood-red becomes almost terra-
cotta ; in the Orange Bishop Weaver of Africa the scarlet frill turns
to yellow, and the same happens to the Sepoy Finch of India. This
change of colour is even more pronounced in soft-billed birds. The
Scarlet Tanager, one of the finest red species in existence, becomes
terra-cotta ; the Australian Scarlet-breasted Robin--a glorious bird--
is hardly recognizable as the same, having turned a dirty pink or creamy
white. The Sanguineous Honey-eater or Bloodbird, which is really
scarlet, moults into a dirty pink. What is the reason for these colour
changes ?
I take it, according to scientific explanation, that there is no colour
pigment in the feathers, although according to Dr. Butler Professor
Church found copper in the wing-feathers of Touracous ; but this is
probably exceptional. As I understand it the colour is produced by
interference of the light waves. As we know, a feather consists of
a main shaft with barbs, and these latter are furnished with barbules,
so that when a wing-feather has become distorted it is quite easy to
readjust it by gently raising the lower barbules and dropping them
over those above. Now suppose that the food to which these birds
have been accustomed at liberty cannot be given in captivity, it is
quite feasible that this may cause during the moult a malformation of
the minute parts of the feathers. If, then, there is any difference in
the minute structure of a feather before or after a moult, the quality
of the light reflected from it will naturally be different, and in this way
create the change we see in various degrees as the malformations may
be slight or severe. Contra to this theory I have heard or seen it stated
somewhere that through unnatural food the blood deteriorates, and in
conjunction with probably insufficient sunshine cannot assimilate the
necessary light and chemicals to create and store the colour pigment
seen in wild birds. I cannot personally endorse this theory, for it
presupposes the existence of colour pigment with which the blood feeds

An Old Australian Bird-lover--The Colour Question 247
the feathers, no matter whether they are perfect or malformed. I am
confirmed in this view by the experiment I made with some scarlet
Robins. Removing a small patch of the red breast feathers I found
that the new growth made an ugly area of dirty pink amid the scarlet.
Assuming that the blood had stored up sufficient red pigment to last
from one moult to the next, one would think it would supply the new
feathers with the stored red pigment in the same way as those left
undisturbed. Acting upon what Dr. Butler says, I tried to wash out
the red of feathers belonging to different species, and as they were
feathers of freshly caught birds I should say the experiment should
have succeeded if anything really was to be washed out; but I can
state definitely that no particle of colour came away. That birds after
a bath appear to have a modified colour sometimes different from the
original--like Green Parrots, which generally show a bronze tint after
a bath--shows that there can be no colour feeding from the blood,
or there would be no change of colour before or after a bath. The
particles of what appears colouring matter in the water may quite
likely be the powdery substance found on many birds' feathers. Any-
one who handles, for instance, Kagus knows that the hand becomes
quite grey with the powdery stuff, the colour of the plumage of
the bird.
These colour changes have always interested me, and for many
years I have carried on experiments with Australian insectivorous
birds and foreign seed-eaters. One fact I have settled to my entire
satisfaction, and that is that both insectivorous and seed-eating birds
require a certain amount of live food, which itself has lived upon live
plants. They absolutely require these a few months before the moult
sets in. I have tried this on Orange Bishops in conjunction with
feeding on unripe seed, such as millet or grass-seed still in a milky
state. / almost got back the original scarlet colour! Red-breasted
Australian Robins fed upon mealworms exclusively produced a dirty
pink after the first moult, others which received in addition to the
ordinary soft bill food minced raw beef became almost white, which
shows that the mealworms fed on dry vegetable matter like bran will
not produce the natural scarlet in the feathers. During my experiments
with the Sanguineous Honey-eater (Blood-bird) 1 allowed some of these

to fly in a large outdoor aviary set with grape-vines and other plants,
which attracted myriads of the tiny leaf-fly. The flies served the Blood-
birds as food in addition to the sugar water they received. All these
birds moulted perfectly into their natural scarlet plumage. At the
same time others were placed in a large cage with plenty of sunlight,
and fed on sugar water sprinkled only with dried and crushed cocoons
of flies and with powdered flies, this providing the protein which is
necessary for our and their existence. The birds did very well on this
diet and moulted without trouble, but--a washed-out pink ! This
seems to prove that it was the leaf-fly in conjunction with unlimited
sunlight which caused the natural colour to reappear.
It is certainly a remarkable fact that it is the red which suffers
in moulting, and even nature itself produces these changes, as, for
instance, in the Yellow-headed Gouldian, the Yellow-headed Parrot-
finch of Fiji, and even the gorgeous King Parrot of Australia, of which
I have seen at least one living specimen having the scarlet colour
replaced by yellow. Furthermore, these colour changes are not nearly
so frequent in Parrots, the probability being that their nature better
adapts itself to dry feeding in captivity.
THE REVIVAL OE AVICULTURE
By H. E. Rogers
1 have no doubt that business will now gradually increase, and
keep increasing for a year or so until the normal pre-War standard
is attained--possibly that may be greatly exceeded by the addition
of considerable trade formerly in Continental hands, chiefly German.
One may gather from articles in the Times and illustrations in the
pictorials, Irish Life, etc., that there have been a number of unusual,
rare, or remarkable arrivals during the past few months. Amongst
mammals was an interesting Chimpanzee from the Congo, which
I supplied to the Dublin Zoo, illustrated in Irish Life October 3.
A black Mangaby monkey from the Congo was illustrated in the Mail
and Field. Some Red-billed Toucans, Curassows, etc., and a pair of
Red Titi Monkeys from the Upper Amazon also arrived here safely.

What I am more particularly writing about at the moment,
however, is a very rare Amazon from Western Ecuador. I think it
is particularly interesting to Aviculture, and have sent the bird to
Mr. Allen Silver to keep for me. It is Chrysotis lilacina, also termed
coccineofrons and viridigenalis. I do not think the species has ever
been illustrated in your Magazine. If the bird has not been previously
figured I think it is sufficiently rare to deserve attention.
[By the generosity of Mr. Rogers arrangements are being made to
have the bird illustrated in the Magazine.]
AYICUI ;ru RAI. NOTES
Two Rare Birds. --Among birds in the Indian consignment which
arrived in August, 1919, I noticed and acquired two very uncommon
specimens: A hen Chestnut-breasted Rock Thrush ( Petrocincla
erythrogastra) and a Maroon Oriole ( Oriolus trailli). Mr. Astley very
generously gave me a mate for the former. The Oriole I could not at
first make out, and was unable to look it up whilst in town. Mr. D.
Seth-Smith very kindly helped me out of my difficulty by identifying
it from a rough sketch. The bird has a Hangnest type of bill, and its
call is rather musical. It behaves like a Starling when alarmed by a dog,
and then calls out harshly. The figure of it in Gould's Asiatic Birds
does not show the very accentuated bill to advantage. I have no record
of it coming over alive before, and should be glad to know if it has been
previously kept in any English collection. --Allen Silver.
Finch Larks. --Some time back I saw an article in the Avicultural
Magazine on the breeding of African Finch Larks by Mr. Shore Baily
(Avicultural Magazine , April, 1919). The pair I have has bred with me
every year since 1915, rearing two young each time. If the first brood
fails they make a second nest. Before breeding they always ask for
mealworms, and this craving lasts till the young are fairly old. The pair
of young are generally a true pair, the cock moulting only in the second
year. In infancy he shows a brownish base over the bill ; the hen is
even-coloured.--G. A. Heumann.

In issuing their Report for the past year the Council wishes to draw
particular attention to three important changes that have been
introduced in that period :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.454206416666667">
(1) The Increase of the Subscription .--The unprecedented rise in
wages and the price of material, augmenting by over one hundred per
cent the cost of production of the Magazine, compelled the Executive
reluctantly to raise the subscription from ten to twenty shillings per
annum. Although it was feared that this course might lose the
Society the support of some lukewarm subscribers, the confidence of
the Council that the wisdom of their decision would appeal to the
majority of aviculturists was justified beyond expectation, and the
response to the inevitable demand was most gratifying. With very
few exceptions the members fully appreciated the necessity for the
call made upon them, and willingly acquiesced in the innovation.
(2) The Change of Ptiblishers .--In spite of the additional revenue

resulting from the increased subscription the Treasurer found the
income of the Society insufficient to meet the high cost of issuing the
Magazine at the rates charged by printers in London. It w r as decided,
therefore, to open negotiations with provincial firms, and arrangements
were finally made with Stephen Austin &amp; Sons, of Hertford, w r ell known
to some members of the Council as experienced printers of scientific
periodicals at relatively reasonable charges. That the saving in
expense thus achieved has not affected adversely the character and
style of the Magazine will be admitted by all Members of the Society.

<bodyText confidence="0.9970956" page_id="10105358"  page_num="Page 251" year="" vol="">
Since the inauguration of the Society in 1894 its year has commenced
in November, and terminated in the following October. Many
inconveniences connected with finance and publication have arisen
from this anomalous arrangement, and the Council have for a long
while been convinced that coincidence between the Society's year and
the calendar year would be a distinct advantage, not only to Members
but also to non-members interested in Aviculture who consult and
quote the Magazine. It was decided, therefore, to make the change,
and the Society's year for the future will begin on January 1 and end
on December 31 following.
In announcing the regretted retirement of Miss Rose Alderson
from the Honorary Secretaryship the Council wishes to place on record
their sincere appreciation of the services she rendered the Society
during her tenure of that post, and at the same time to express their
heartfelt sympathy with her for the serious illness which compelled
her to send in her resignation. Miss Alderson took up the arduous
duties of Honorary Business Secretary at a time when the Council was
faced with the difficulty of finding a volunteer able and willing to
undertake the task ; and the able manner in which, despite all obstacles,
she conducted the affairs of the Society through a period of exceptional
stress deserves the gratitude of all its Members. Dr. Lovell-Keays,
who acted as Secretary for a short time before his services were required
for the country during the War, has kindly consented to resume the
post in succession to Miss Alderson.
A point connected with the present volume, upon which the Council
feels compelled to comment, is the noticeable falling off in the numbers
of articles and notes dealing with the main business and purpose of
the Society, namely Aviculture, and the substitution, unavoidable under
the circumstances, of essays rather ornithological than avicultural in
character. This regrettable event is attributable partly to the absence
from England of many of our usual contributors or to their occupation
with other matters ; but mainly, it appears, to the general disorganiza-
tion of commerce involving the animal trade, which for long prevented,
and still hampers, the importation of living birds. For 1920 the
prospect is brighter ; and since the number of interesting exotic birds

Report of the Council for 1918-1919
coming into the country is steadily and rapidly on the increase, and
aviculturists are thereby being provided with opportunities for re-
stocking their depleted aviaries, the Council ventures to hope that
during the coining year Members will have no difficulty in finding
subject-matter to supply the Editor with articles or paragraphs on
Aviculture which will bring the volume up to the standard of pre-
War days.
Signed for the Council,
R. I. POCOCIv,
Acting Hon. Business Secretary.

While this Report was in the printers&amp;apos; hands news was
received of the death of Miss Alderson. Under the
circumstances it is not possible for the Council to do
more than record their sincere sorrow for the loss of an
esteemed friend and coadjutor, and to express their
cordial sympathy with the members of her family. An
obituary notice will appear in the next issue of the
Magazine.

Life Histories of North American Diving Birds, Order
Pygopodes. By Arthur Cleveland Bent. United States
National Museum, Bulletin 107.
Among the many ornithological publications which come to one's
notice each year, most deal either with classification, the description
of new species or local races, or accounts of recently acquired
collections of skins ; it is therefore most refreshing (especially to an
aviculturist) to receive a highly interesting and exhaustive treatise
of well over two hundred pages dealing exclusively with the life-
histories of a group of very charming birds.
In the preparation of his valuable article Mr. Bent has been assisted
by numerous friends, both with useful information respecting the
habits of the different species and their distribution, and also by the
contribution of many admirable photographs of the birds, their nests,
and nesting-sites. Among these illustrations, all of which are excellent,
those facing pp. 3, 49, and 185 strike one as being singularly
attractive.
The paper commences with the Grebes (Colymbidse), the account of
which occupies nearly forty-seven pages ; it then passes on to the
Loons (Gaviidse), known to us as Divers * ; on p. 82 the history of the
Alcidae (Auks, Murres or Guillemots, and Puffins) commences, and
continues to the end of the treatise. The completeness of the
information respecting the various species, together with the numerous
beautiful illustrations, must appeal at once to any student of nature.
A dozen very characteristic coloured plates of the eggs accompany
the article.
It might perhaps have been advantageous to those who like myself
do not possess a synonymic catalogue of the Pygopodes if Mr. Bent had
inserted the synonymy of each species under its name. In these days of
priority-worship and the hair-splitting of genera and species, the names
of many of the best-known forms have been so altered that to a naturalist
* On the Norfolk Broads this name is given to the Grebes.

of even the end of the past century they would be unrecognizable.
I rejoiced to see our old friends TJria troile (or troille) and Aha tore!a
still in possession of their old names, and even the Black Guillemot,
though turned out of the genus TJria, still retains his specific title.
By the way, who was cruel enough to burden one of these beautiful
birds with the barbarous generic title of SynthJiboramphus ?

An ABC of Common Birds : A Pocket Guide to the Commoner
Inland Birds of Britain. Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds, London, S.W. 1. Price 6 d.
This is an excellent little booklet, simple, practical, and good in
every way ; its source alone would commend it. Space is limited, but
every word is carefully chosen. Many sizable books on birds go miles
further, as it were, without giving such a sharp and vivid impression
as this diminutive work. It is a " first aid " to the study of birds,
and sets out to give " short and simple descriptions from which they
may be identified by the unlearned, their local names, and brief notes
on the food they eat that may be regarded as ' pro ' or 4 con ' the
interests of husbandman and gardener ". The description of some of the
songs is excellent, the Blackbird's for example, flute-like, leisurely ;
a leading song bird," the Tree Pipit's, " sweet, canary-like, with long
drawn, languishing final notes." The description of some other songs
does not strike the ear quite so happily ; for example, those of the
three Buntings. This little work is a pocket guide of useful information,
and its author is obviously a careful field observer.

New List of Natural History Photographs. By W. J. Berridge,

Menagerie of the Zoological Society delineated, he remarks that the book

will bring the collection into the actual home of the reader without the
necessity of paying it a visit. Similarly, those who have seen
Mr. Berriclge's beautiful photographs (and who has not ?) may form
a vivid idea of the Zoo without a trip to Regent's Park.
Mr. Berridge's list, now before us, embraces a wide range of subjects
--Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Batrachians, Fish, and miscellaneous
creatures. His photographs are so well known that to describe them
is superfluous ; not only are they realistic zoologically, but from the
photographic standpoint they are true works of art. In the too small
band of first-class Zoo photographers Mi&amp;apos;. Berridge holds high place.
Aviculturists will warmly appreciate the beautiful Bird of Paradise
study which adorns this issue of the Magazine.

Dear Dr. Renshaw, --Lately everything has conspired to prevent
my getting over to the " Zoo ", notwithstanding the fact that our
home is so close to it that we can, in the stillness of the night, not only
hear the low growlings of the Lions and Tigers, but often the nocturnal
noises of the smaller animals : it is all music to me. This week it looks
as though I might get a few hours over there before the seven short
days slip by. Should I do so I will make every effort to break the ice
in pulling together for you some photographs of the birds, later on
writing out a brief account of the bird contingent at our " Zoo ". We
have a beautiful fowl pond there and many rare birds, as the California
Condor, Kea Parrot, Trumpeter Swan -- the last of its race, its mate
having died not long ago. Mr. Hollister, the Superintendent, is a good
friend of mine, and will assist me in every possible way. He will
send ordinary birds and animals, when not too big, over to my own
photographic room to have their pictures taken for the Press, etc.
I have very lately received a skeleton of the Wedge-tailed Eagle
from Captain White, and I will describe and figure it for the Emu.
You see that publication regularly, of course--has not Dr. Leach made
a fine thing of it ? R. W. Shufeldt.

M. DELACOUR'S NEW ESTATE
Dear Dr. Renshaw, --I am glad to tell you that I have got a new
country seat in Normandy, the Chateau de Cleres (Seine-Inferieure)
between Rouen and Dieppe.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.907623" page_id="10105363"  page_num="Page 256" year="" vol="">
I shall attempt immediately to build aviaries and arrange the park
for birds. There is running water and a lake of about three acres,
quite convenient for Waders and Waterfowl. I hope to have ready
for next spring a bird gallery, two bird-rooms, twenty aviaries with
heated shelters, and twenty enclosures, as well as larger paddocks for
Ostriches, Rheas, Cassowaries, and Cranes.
I think it will be a good beginning, and hope to improve it later on.
I cannot possibly pretend to keep at once the same number of birds
as I used to do at Villers-Bretonneux, owing to the awful prices one has
to pay for everything nowadays.
Cleres is only 25 miles from Dieppe ; I hope that it will be convenient
for British aviculturists to stop there on their way to the Continent.
Yours very sincerely,
Delacour.
