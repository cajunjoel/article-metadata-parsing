REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1928

<bodyText confidence="0.955678935483871" page_id="56185613"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
During the year we have received many letters from all parts of
the globe telling how much the Avicultural Magazine is appreciated ;
this is very gratifying to hear, and we would like to thank those
members who have taken the trouble to write.
As the years go by and our membership increases, our chief object
is to keep the standard of the Magazine at a very high level.
This has only been made possible by the excellent editorship of
Mr. Seth-Smith, to whom the whole society owe a deep debt of gratitude.
With this volume we have published twelve coloured plates, and
with a few exceptions they speak for themselves as to their high quality
both as regards their execution and their method of reproduction.
The main feature of the year has been the formation of various
Avicultural Societies in Australasia, showing how keen is the interest
taken in keeping foreign birds in captivity in other countries as well
as our own. These we hope to see affiliated to the Avicultural Society
in the near future, and we wish to extend to them our very cordial
support.
To all who have furthered the interest of the Society during the
past year we beg to offer our very hearty thanks. Especially we would
like to mention Lord Tavistock, Mr. G. B. Chapman, Mr. G. H. Gurney,
and Mr. H. Whitley for their gifts of plates ; Miss Chawner for her
unremitting labours in translating articles, Mr. T. H. Newman for
managing the sale and exchange column, and Mr. Hicks for conducting
post-mortem examinations.
As we go to press we learn with the deepest regret of the death
of the Viscountess Grey of Falloden. Lady Grey was a member of
our Council and a keen lover of birds, and her death is a great loss
to the avicultural world.
(Signed for the Council) E. Maud Knobel,
Hon. Secretary and Treasurer.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a &apos;permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the Species .
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

By J. Delacqur
Ducks are met with all over the globe wherever there is either fresh
or salt water to provide them with the means of existence. Generally
speaking they abound most in large swamps. Some few prefer damp
forests, others streams, while certain species are purely sea birds and
some frequent either fresh or salt water according to the time of year.
Most Ducks are omnivorous, swallowing with equal readiness
grain, grass, insects, and small animals. Those nearest to Geese are in
general the greatest grass feeders. Diving Ducks, especially the
marine species, feed principally on shell-fish and crustaceans, while the
mergansers are fish-eaters.
If considered according to their distribution, Ducks may be divided
into Arctic, Temperate, and Tropical species. The first named comprise
those living in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, Asia, and North
America) where Ducks are very numerous and certain species live all
the year round.

J. Delacow -- -Ducks
Ducks living in these tropical countries have well-defined limits.
In Asia (India and Indo-China), in Africa, America, and Oceania certain
kinds have an enormously wide range, over whole continents. On the
other hand a great many species found in the temperate zone come there
only for the winter and join forces with the resident tropical kinds.
Ducks belonging to the Northern Hemisphere are nearly all migratory
and as a rule breed farthest south where they can secure the most
favourable conditions. All have more or less a double moult and from
June to October the drakes lose their gay plumage and take on the
sober hues of the ducks. This is known as the " eclipse plumage
This eclipse is less complete among the diving than with the surface-
feeding Ducks, and among those kinds where the male and female
are alike there is either no eclipse at all or it is scarcely noticeable.
The same holds good with Australian, South African, and South
American species.
Tropical species do not usually undergo eclipse, though there are
certain exceptions, e.g. the little Cotton Teal, where the drake only
wears his bright colours at the breeding season.
Those Ducks which dwell in temperate Australia, South Africa, or
America are migratory like the northern species, but to a less degree,
on account of their habitat. Their migrations are mostly determined
by the greater or lesser amount of water in their localities, and they
breed where circumstances permit.
The tropical species are sedentary, or at the most" somewhat
wandering.
When at liberty Ducks are nocturnal, but this habit is imposed on
them by fear of their enemies and of mankind in chief.
There is no need to point out their skill in swimming, diving, and
flying, which varies according to the species. Some have lost or are
on the way to lose their power of flight.
Ducks are naturally monogamous, they only become polygamous
when their instincts are altered by captivity. The greater number
nest on the ground, often among reeds by the side of water ; some nest
in holes, and a good many in holes in trunks of trees or in old nests of
other birds. The tropical species as a rule are the most arboreal.
Speaking generally the drakes have a hoarse whistling voice, while

the ducks quack resoundingly. Very often this is the best way to
distinguish the sexes.
In the height of the breeding season both drakes and ducks indulge
in strange antics which are characteristic of their species, but which
we have no space to describe in detail. They are very amusing to
watch. They also become quarrelsome, and may injure one another
by their violence.
For practical study it will be best to divide the Ducks into the
following groups :--
(a) Perching Ducks, which together with certain genera which
we have already discussed among the Geese (Plectroptera) belong to the
sub-species of Plectropterinse. They all have long tails, legs placed far
forward, and rather small, high, narrow bills. They prefer to perch
and often build in holes in trees. They are all tropical and non-
migratory ; some kinds have an eclipse plumage.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.831738428571429" page_id="56185664"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
(b) Sheldrakes, related to the Egyptian and Orinoco Geese, having
broad, flat bills slightly turned up at the tip, and long tails. They
generally nest in holes in the ground and do not perch. They are to
be met with in temperate Europe and Asia, Africa and Oceania. They
are only slightly migratory, and have no marked eclipse plumage.
(c) Tree Ducks ; a very distinct genus having short tails, long
necks and bills. Both sexes utter shrill whistling cries, and have

rounder wings than other Ducks. They perch occasionally and some-
times nest in trees, but as a general rule prefer the middle of a reed
bed. They belong to the tropics and do not migrate though they
may sometimes wander. They do not go into eclipse.
(d) Surface-feeding Ducks, which are the true Ducks, are found
chiefly in cold or temperate regions ; they are mostly migratory. As a
rule they nest on the ground and do not perch. The northern kinds
have an eclipse plumage, but the Southern either none or very little;
they live chiefly on the surface of the water.

They are found in the cold and temperate parts of Europe, Asia, and
America ; one species is a native of New Zealand, and another inhabits
Brazil. To them may be joined the curious river Ducks of New Zealand
and New Guinea ; they go into eclipse.
Few birds are more desirable in confinement than Ducks, and they
are indispensable ornaments of all ponds and pieces of water. If their
size and quantity are in proportion to the space provided they neither
foul nor spoil it, while nothing can be prettier or more amusing.
Ducks can be kept suitably either in practically complete liberty, on
a lake, or confined in a garden or small enclosure provided with water.
In a large place, provided that the water does not communicate
too directly with neighbouring rivers, Ducks may be loosed without
much fear of their straying ; but they are not absolutely safe unless
the park is either fenced or walled. Such a park, containing a running
stream, is ideal. It may be stocked with about 200 Ducks to 2J acres
of water, from which it is easy to calculate how many the park or
garden in which it is proposed to keep them should contain. If the
place is not very large it is wise to keep only one pair of a kind, by which
means quarrels may be avoided. In any case, vicious species should be
avoided; these are, however, few, and shall receive special mention when
we come to describe them. Individuals may prove aggressive or
inclined to cross with other species ; these should be eliminated and
replaced. If the pond extends to about an acre or more it will accommo-
date several pairs of the same species.
In order to succeed in either garden or park it is most necessary
to exclude all enemies. The worst is the otter, which does frightful
slaughter among Ducks. If otters inhabit the neighbourhood, it is
important to make all fences at least 6 feet high, preferably with wire
netting at the top, and above all to cover every inlet and outlet of the
water with a grating. It is scarcely necessary to add that the Ducks
must be protected from foxes and vermin. But if the Ducks have access
to islands they are fairly safe. Islands are a necessity, for it is there that
most of the Ducks will nest. Bats, too, are dangerous, particularly

to ducklings. All these foes must be destroyed throughout the
neighbourhood.
When installed after this fashion Ducks will find abundance of
natural food as well in the water as on its brink, and it will be quite
sufficient to given them one ration of grain (corn, barley, and kibbled
maize) daily and a mash made of bran and barley-meal in equal
quantities with 10 per cent of meat meal or fish ; more of this mixture
is required in winter than in summer.
Only under these conditions of semi-liberty can one hope to obtain
the maximum breeding results or keep the more aquatic and delicate
kinds alive.
Failing natural water Ducks can be kept in enclosures provided
with ponds either in pairs or several together. In the first case the
enclosure should be at least 50 yards square, grass covered, and con-
taining a pond of at least 10 square yards and bushes. Most species
only need a low fence, about 3 ft. high, made of wood or zinc to keep
them safely away from the outside world. But such enclosures are
necessary to confine aggressive or particularly valuable species which
it is desired to keep separate. If the enclosures can be provided with
running water so much the better, if not, the tanks should be emptied
and cleaned out every week. If several pairs of Ducks are to be kept
in one enclosure a sufficient number of ponds must be provided ; it may
be calculated that each pair will require 50 square yards of water
which should have islands and the banks in places thinly planted
with bushes.
It is often difficult to persuade adult Ducks to nest in confinement
even on a large sheet of water. They frequently will not lay until many
years have elapsed, and sometimes never lay at all. But it is, on the other
hand, quite easy to obtain broods from young Ducks reared in confine-
ment. For this reason one should always endeavour to procure these,
which also have the additional attraction of being fairly tame, but if
they are not to be had the next best plan is to get Ducks reared from
eggs laid by wild birds but hatched under a hen and reared in confine-
ment. If such are unobtainable also one must put up with birds which
were adult when caught, and give them plenty of space, but not expect
eggs for several years in the majority of cases.

Ducks kept in a park or a large garden usually go to nest in a natural
way and find suitable places for themselves, particularly if they have
access to islands. They may also be given wooden nesting boxes.
The simplest kind is a box about 3 ft. by 1 ft. 6 in. without a
bottom and having one side half open, laid on the ground and hidden
among shrubs and grass ; it often proves very attractive. For perching
Ducks a similar box but having a bottom, fixed at some height from
the ground and approached by a sloping tree-trunk or rough board.
Similar boxes, or square ones on feet flush with the water in the pond
itself are usually very attractive.
It is often risky to allow Ducks to hatch and rear their young.
Accidents of various kinds often cause considerable losses ; the young
may die from insufficient nourishment and it is difficult, almost
impossible, to tend them. But a fair proportion can be reared in this
way, and it has the advantage of giving no trouble.
It is, however, much wiser to collect the eggs. In spring a daily
round should enable one to learn where the birds have hidden their
eggs, not always a very easy matter. In order that they may not go and
lay somewhere else other eggs must be substituted for those which
are removed until the full clutch has been laid. The eggs should
then be placed under a Bantam or other small hen, the character of
the foster-mother being of the greatest importance. She should be
chosen for her gentle, quiet disposition. The eggs are apt to become
somewhat damp on straw and nests on the bare ground are desirable.
Care must be taken that the ducklings do not leave the nest as soon
as hatching takes place, or they will be lost. It is best to set the hens
in boxes which can be entirely closed, and to leave the ducklings in
the nest for forty-eight hours afterwards ; they and the hen should be
kept in a rearing box and given a dish containing food and water.
There are two way&apos;s of rearing under a hen, and either will give
good results. One way is to let the ducklings go to water from the
the first, in which case they must be watched to see if they can dry
themselves ; the second way is to deny them access to water, giving them
drink in such small vessels that they cannot wet themselves. This
formerly was the method generally adopted, but at the present day
they are usually allowed to go into water at once ; but they require

careful watching to prevent them from staying wet, as if so they will
certainly die ; they should be dried in front of a fire whenever they seem
to be suffering. Perhaps the best plan is when they are a few days old
to allow access to a little enclosure with short grass and a shallow pond.
To succeed with ducklings a certain number should be placed in
little enclosures of about 6 to 10 square yards, where they are safe
from rats, crows and other enemies. They like sun and dislike damp,
and they must have shelter from rain. They may be left so until
they are about two months old provided that the water is frequently
changed. It is very important that these rearing pens should be where
they can easily be kept under close observation.
Ducklings of the same age and nearly related species can be kept
together, but it is unsafe to put strong and feeble ones in the same pen.
Their food in the early stages should be a mixture of soaked bread,
duckweed, ants' eggs, and dried insects, crashed biscuit and powdered
meat, with custard (eggs and milk whipped and cooked together).
Little by little grain should be added, and a simpler mixture made up
of barley meal, pollards, grated bread crumbs, biscuit meal, powdered
meat or fish. The first should be given in equal quantities, the last
in the proportion of 10 per cent. It is a good thing to keep on with the
duckweed, which is an indispensable food, as long as possible, later
it can be replaced by grass, salad, or any other green food.
Ducklings grow rapidly, and are nearly full sized in two months.
The sexes can be told by their voices when they are three months old.
Swans, Geese, and Ducks should be pinioned, or there is always
the fear that they will fly away. This operation consists in removing
the tip of the wing bearing the flight feathers. One way to do this
is to bind the wing tightly above the thumb, represented by a little
protuberance, and to cut it immediately above with strong scissors
or pruners. The binding stops the flow of blood. The wound is then
cauterized with tincture of iodine; later the tie will fall off of itself.
Another way is to cut off the joint with a knife and mallet and then to
let the bird go on the water at once, when the wound quickly heals.
The best age to pinion the birds is from three to four weeks while
the wing is still rudimentary and the operation therefore correspondingly
slight. At this age the joint is cut off with a pair of scissors. A good

many of the more sedentary kinds can be left full winged, such as
Mandarins, Carolinas, Tree Ducks, etc., if one is not afraid that they
will be killed by neighbours, or if the domain is sufficiently large.
Ducks are certainly more interesting when they can fly and they
breed more freely if they are full winged.
Ducks travel well on short journeys of a few days, but not so if
they have to be boxed up for several weeks. They soil themselves and
their feathers lose their power of resisting water. &quot;When they again
have access to water they immerse themselves completely and soon
drown or die of cold if they are not dried at once, but as a rule after
several consecutive baths and dryings their plumage recovers its
water-proofing. Nearly all Ducks once acclimatized are hardy and can
spend the winter out of doors provided they have access to unfrozen
water.

This is a group comprising species which are decidedly incongruous
and vary much in size. Most of them live on the banks of wooded
streams either in small companies or single pairs, perch and often
nest in trees.
The Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata) inhabits Central America
and the north of South America in the wild state, but its domesticated
descendants are to be met with in every quarter of the globe. The
wild bird is dark brown with very fine green and purple lights and with
white wing-coverts. Between its eye and bill are small red wattles
which in the domesticated race become large and ugly. The bill is
black and rose colour, feet black, iris yellowish brown. The sexes
are alike, but the drake is twice as large as the duck. It has a very
low voice.
They are very beautiful birds,&quot;but unfortunately extremely combative
with large Ducks or Geese, and must be kept separate. They are very
hardy and breed freely.
The Comb-duck (Sarcidiornis melanonota) inhabits Africa, India, and
Indo-China. Its back, wings, and tail are black with very brilliant
green and purple reflections ; the rest of its plumage is white more or
less black spotted, it has the bill black and grey feet. The drake

is much larger than the duck and has brighter reflections. His abdomen
and sometimes his head are yellowish, and he carries a large caruncle
at the base of his bill which becomes much larger in the breeding season.
He is silent as a rule, but at times utters loud cries.
This species frequents swamps surrounded by trees ; it is pretty
freely imported, is hardy and usually inoffensive in confinement, but
not a free breeder. Once only a duck belonging to Mr. Blaauw laid,
but the eggs were clear. It is a very ornamental bird.
S. carunculata is like the preceding save that its flanks are blackish.
It is found in Brazil but appears to be rare. It is seldom imported.
The White-winged Duck (Asarcornis scutulata), a native of India,
Indo-China, and Malaya, in size and habits resembles the Muscovy
Duck. Its head and neck are white with black spots, the rest of its
plumage is golden brown deepening into chestnut below, having the
wings heavily marked with white and blue grey. Its beak is yellow,
orange at the base, and speckled with brown, feet orange yellow. It is
very rare in confinement, but does not appear to be quarrelsome.
Hartlaub's Duck ( Pteronetta hartlaubi) lives in Guinea and the
Congo ; it has never been imported alive. It is a handsome bright
chestnut bird with forehead and sometimes the top of the head white,
the back of the head and neck are black, the wing-coverts white.
The Pink-headed Duck ( Rhodonessa caryojohyllacea) inhabits East
India where it has become very rare. Its colour is deep golden brown,
with white rectrices ; its bill, head, and neck save for a narrow band
in front, are a glorious rose colour ; its feet are brown. The Duck's
head and neck are brown shot with rose colour.
This superb Duck has always been rare in confinement. Some were
obtained by Mr. Ezra in 1925.
The Cotton Teal ( Nettopus coromandelianus) is met with in India,
China, Indo-China, Malaysia, and part of Oceania. It is a very small
bird with a short raised bill like a Bernicle, and with very short
feet. In spring the drake is white with the back of the head black, its
back, part of the wings and a narrow collar are fine metallic green ;
its tail is grey and the primaries black and white, bill and feet black.
During the rest of the year the drake is white with grey spots beneath,
grey above and with the top of the head and eyebrows grey. The

duck is the same except that there is no white in her wings. This
species does well in confinement, but on account of its highly aquatic
habits is very difficult to import. In Europe it has only made its appear-
ance at the Zoological Gardens of London, and with Messrs. Astley, Ezra,
and Delacour. Mr. Astley managed to keep it alive for nine years.
To bring these birds over alive a cage containing a large tank
would be necessary, perches would be required, and the birds should
be given as much green food as possible. Once landed and acclimatized
they can be fed like ordinary Ducks and given the same treatment
as small Teals. They can be wintered in the open.
There are two other species of about the same size, N. auritus of
Africa and N. pulchellus of Australia. The first is metallic green above,
with the sides of the head light green bordered with black. Eace and
front of the neck are white, as is the abdomen. The breast and flanks
are light chestnut, the bill yellow, feet black. The duck's face and neck
are white with grey spots.
The second species is green above and on the neck ; it has the sides
of the head, the speculum, and abdomen white ; the breast, back,
upper tail-coverts and flanks are white streaked with greenish grey.
These two species have not yet been imported.
The two species of the genus Aix are perhaps the most beautiful
of all Ducks ; everybody knows and admires the Carolina and the
Mandarin.
The Carolina Duck (A . sponsa) originally comes from North
America ; in summer it is found as far north as Canada and in the
winter as far south as the Gulf of Mexico and Cuba. It is not necessary
to describe it as the reader can study the coloured plate which gives
both sexes. The drake goes into eclipse from June to October, but wears
a different plumage to that of the duck.
The Mandarin Duck (A. galericulata) conies from China, Formosa,
and Japan, and goes for the summer to Siberia. Again we bid our
readers study the plate and refrain from describing the drake ; the
duck is very much like that of the Carolina, but stands higher and
always has a distinct white eyebrow, while the colour of the upper
parts is lighter. The drake in eclipse resembles the duck, but has a
paler face and reddish bill instead of a black one.

Although, they appear to be closely related it is exceedingly rare
for the two species to interbreed. Both Carolinas and Mandarins like
wooded streams, frequently perch in trees and nest in hollow trunks.
They are hardy and robust in confinement, but at every age have a
tremendous capability of climbing, which makes it very difficult to
keep them in a small place. They usually stay well in a garden or park,
and do not attempt to leave the water, but sometimes they are inclined
to roam at the approach of the nesting season. For this reason it is
best to keep them unpinioned as they are better able to escape danger
when they are roaming, and they can get back more readily. It is
most important to give them raised boxes in which to lay. The young
can be reared like other Ducks but are somewhat delicate, though with
care they can safely be reared. Their parents will rear them if they are
kept in small enclosures or even aviaries.
Mandarins and Carolinas thrive equally well under all circumstances
whether they have complete freedom and power of flight or are kept
in an aviary in a small garden.

THE MIGRATION OF SNOWY OWLS, 1926-7
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988965" page_id="56185674"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
In the autumn and winter of 1926 quite a number of Snowy Owls
arrived in this country on board steamers coming from North America.
They had flown aboard in the Western Atlantic, sometimes several
hundred miles from land and generally in a very starved and exhausted
condition. Previously to this one had known of rare instances of these
Owls being taken in this way, but only a very few cases had been
reported during the last twenty years or so.
The 1926 invasion of these splendid Owls was quite exceptional
and one wondered what could be the cause of so many Owls having
wandered so far from their natural habitat. Inquiries were made of the
Hudson Bay Company to * ascertain whether there had been any
interruption in the supply of rodents such as rabbits and lemmings,
the natural food of these Owls, in their far northern home, and their
courteous reply was to the effect that the season of 1925 had been
an unusually good one for rabbits, but during the latter half of 1926
these rodents had almost disappeared, disease or other obscure cause

having resulted in their sudden diminution. So here apparently was
the key to the solution of the puzzle as to the cause of the erratic
movements of the Owls.
So much for the few scattered wanderers that were picked up by
ships, having lost their way over the face of the waters ; but what
of the main stock from which these came ? American ornithologists
were alive to the importance of an unusually large southern migration
of these birds, and at once sought for records of their appearance both
in south-eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, and the
result of the inquiry is embodied in an extremely interesting and
valuable report in the October number of the Auk from the able pen
of Mr. Alfred 0. Gross.
The invasion which commenced in October, 1926, reached its height
on 16th November, and thence gradually diminished and ceased in the
early part of 1927. It can only be described as vast, the birds travelling
in large numbers through south-eastern Canada to the north-eastern
United States, following the courses of the rivers and great lakes and
congregating along the coast, feeding upon dead fish as well as Gulls and
other sea birds, Crows and domestic poultry and so forth. They had
been driven south by hunger, only to meet with a very hostile reception,
for the American man with a gun is no more sparing of any unusual
bird than is his counterpart over here. " The number of these beautiful
and interesting birds that were killed is appalling," writes the author
of the report; " they came at a time when there was a maximum
number of gunners in the field and every Owl that appeared seemed
to be an invitation to shoot. There are few hunters in the far north and
hence the Owls, especially the young birds which were in the majority,
had but little fear of man. Their habit of feeding in the open also
made them conspicuous and easy targets. Many hunters killed them
thinking it their duty to protect the game birds, but too often the Owls
were killed merely to satisfy a desire to kill or a curiosity to examine
a strange bird at close range. A large number of the Owls were
thrown aside and wasted and of course were never reported."
In Canada it is estimated that 1,500 Snowy Owls were killed in
the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec alone, while no less than 2,363
records were received from the United States, and the author of the

reports received from elsewhere I feel that 5,000 is a conservative
estimate of the number of Snowy Owls killed in the United States and
Canada during the 1926-7 flight."
It would be interesting to know how many, if any, of these splendid
birds were spared to return to their home in the far north, and whether
any would have returned if unmolested. This was no normal migration,
but what might be termed an overflow migration, such as occurs
periodically in the case of the small mammals known as lemmings,
and would seem to be Nature&apos;s way of clearing a district of its surplus
population.

Agapornis swindereniana
In 1820 Kuhl described and figured in his well-known Conspectus
Psittacorum a new Parrakeet from a specimen in the Langier collection
at Paris, which he named after the famous Professor van Swinderen
of the Groningen University, Psittacus swindernianus . Nothing more
was heard of this species until 1876, when Mr. Schweizer re-discovered
it in the interior of that little-known country, Liberia, where it frequents
the fruit-trees and oil-palms in flocks of from ten to twenty individuals,
but is not very abundant. Ten specimens were procured which were
divided amongst the Continental museums. No living example has
yet reached Europe, but when Mr. Chapman's collectors " open-up "

Zenker's or the Black-collared Lovebird, of the Cameroons and
Belgian Congo, is very similar to Swinderen's, but differs in that it has
a collar of orange red instead of olive green, and the throat and breast
are tinged with orange yellow. The late Dr. Emir Pasha met with this
species at Manjema in the Belgian Congo and writes in his last journal,
which was published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society , 1894,
p. 599, as follows : "In flocks from three to four these birds may be
seen and heard at morning and evening time, when leaving the trees
they roost in and returning to them; their shrill twitter is at those times
most loudly heard. During the morning they frequent with predilection
the new ripening sesame and the rice-fields, and are often on the soil,
where they move quickly enough. They are great friends of water,
and the Manyuema tell most earnestly their feeding on liquid mud.
At noon they take repose on the best trees, congregating there to 10.15 ;
at 2 or 3 o'clock they are oh again in the fields, take then a second time
to the water, and turn in to sleep towards sunset. Their flight is rapid
and not so awkward as that of Poeocephalus, of which a small species
here exists."
Mr. G. L. Bates, writing on the Birds of Southern Cameroon (Ibis,
1911, pp. 496-7) says :--
" Five specimens, all males, were shot with bows and arrows on
three successive days, together with some others that were damaged,

Lovebird Hybrids

<bodyText confidence="0.985363" page_id="56185680"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
The following crosses have been recorded. It is to be hoped that
any member knowing of any other cross will send particulars to the
Magazine.
Madagascar Lovebird (Agajpornis cana ) X Budgerigar ( Melojp-
sittacus undulatus).
This cross was obtained in Germany, in 1890. Dr. Carl Russ writes
as follows :--\0x25A0
" In the bird chamber of Baron von Grote is a very interesting
hybrid breeding success. A communication from the gentleman
mentioned gives a brief account of a hybrid between a Grey-headed
Dwarf Parrot and an Undulated Grass Parrakeet hen or Budgerigar.
The bird has the shape and markings of the Budgerigar, only the head,
neck, and about half the upper surface exhibits the colouring of the
young of the Madagascar Lovebird." (Die Gejiederte Welt , 1890, p. 223.)
The late Mr. Wesley T. Page reported partial success ; writing on
the Madagascar Lovebird (Bird Notes, 1918, p. 55), he says:--
" A cock mated up with a hen Budgerigar, and one young hybrid
was hatched out and lived to leave the nest; the next day it unfortu-
nately got into the bath (a large shallow vessel only containing an inch
depth of water) and was drowned."
Black-cheeked Lovebird (Agajpornis nigrigenis ) X Budgerigar
(Melojpsittacus undulatus).
The Editor of Bird Notes writes as follows :--
" Our esteemed member Mrs. Higginbotham has four young
of the above cross hatched out and doing well. The male of a pair of
Black-cheeks forsook his own mate and paired up with the Budgerigar.
Seven eggs were duly laid, of which four duly hatched out, both parents

shared the duties of incubation. The Black-cheek feeds the Budgerigar
on the nest, but has not been seen to enter the nest receptacle since
the hatching of the young. There are pairs of Rosella and Alexandrine
ParrakeetS in the aviary, but neither dare go near the nest while the
Black-cheek is in the vicinity." (Bird Notes , 1911, p. 211.)
Mrs. Higginbotham was apparently awarded the F.B.C. medal
for rearing these hybrids. No further mention is made of them, and
it seems probable that they did not live to be independent of their
parents.

Black-cheeked Lovebird (Agapornis nigrigenis) X Peach-faced
Lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis).
Mr. Sumner Marriner bred several pairs in 1924. Two pairs were
exhibited at the Crystal Palace Show, February, 1925, concerning
which Mr. Seth-Smith writes (Avicultural Magazine, 1925, p. 107) :--
" Second and third prizes were awarded to Mr. Sumner Marriner
for pairs of Black-cheeked and Peach-faced hybrids resembling small
Peach-faces with dirty faces."
Two such hybrids (possibly Mr. Marriner's) were in the Parrot
House at the Zoo in 1925, and one lived Until about two months ago,
when it was killed by a rat. The discovery that these two quite distinct
Lovebirds are capable of producing fertile hybrids is of great interest.
Mr. Marriner writes (Avicultural Magazine, April, 1927, p. 116):--
" Last year my hybrid Black-cheeked Peach-faced Lovebirds,
breeding inter se, produced two of their own peculiar progeny."

Mr. Bearby will oblige with some particulars ?

First bred by Williams in 1905, this little bird has not, I believe,
been bred here very many times since. I have had the species on several
occasions, but last season was the first year a pair has gone to nest with
me. My birds have been in my possession now for three years. The
cock is a very handsome little bird with its brilliant scarlet crest, but
the hen is rather a decrepit looking specimen, having permanently
lost half her crest, which in the female is brown instead of scarlet.
At the end of May they constructed a rather flimsy nest of dried grass
at the extreme end of a branch on a conifer, about 5 ft. from the ground.
Three bluish white eggs, unmarked, were laid. Two young were hatched
on 12th June, one of which left the nest on the 20th of the same month.
This youngster was like the mother, but had a broad white wing bar
which was very conspicuous in flight. The young were fed principally
on bread and milk, and what insects the old birds could catch, these
being very few as the season was very unfavourable for insect life.
Whilst still feeding the young the hen again laid in the same nest,
but as this was very dilapidated and I feared it would collapse I removed
the eggs. About this time I left home for a short holiday. On my
return I found the grass in the aviary was nearly knee deep so I had
it cut. My man in doing so found two young birds concealed in it,
as yet unable to fly. These proved to be two more little Pileated Finches
that had evidently fallen from the nest. In a fortnight they were
strong on the wing, but a spell of dreadful weather proved too much for
them. In September they again went to nest, this time in a privet bush.
Thinking the hen had already done enough I removed the eggs once
more. However, she was not yet satisfied for on 1st October I found
her sitting again on three fertile eggs. Two young were hatched, and
these lived about a week, when a deluge of rain drowned them in the
nest. The young one, which I believe to be a male, has not developed a
crest yet, but has lost the white wing bars. This species is an excellent
aviary bird, as it is not quarrelsome, is fairly hardy, and is easy to
cater for. Habitat : Brazil.

THE BREEDING OF THE MASKED LOVEBIRD

Agapornis per sonata is certainly the oddest and most striking member
of the family, a sort of Puffin among the Parrots ; the Black-cheeked
Lovebird over again with all the Black-cheek's quaint points accentuated.
In fact it is my private opinion (unsupportedas yet by any of the scientific
ornithologists who write for The Ibis) that the Masked Lovebird
evolved through a pair of reprobate Black-cheeks selling themselves
to Satan. As a result of this shocking transaction two rather homely
little birds, members of a good-natured race, emerged with noses larger
and redder than they were before, black heads, huge white eye circles,
mustard coloured waistcoats, and pepper and mustard tempers--the
most perfect little nigger devils imaginable ! There is something original
about the Masked Lovebird's temper which separates him from other
spiteful birds. The Grey Struthidea commits murder because he enjoys
the fun of putting things to death ; like the British sportsman, " What
a lovely day," he says, " let's go and kill something." The Passerine
Parrotlet engages in sanguinary conflict because he loves fighting for
fighting's sake when he is feeling fit and happy. Like our friend the dog,
once a row is under way, his motto seems to be " the more we get together
the merrier we shall be ", and pair after pair rush gladly into a general
melee. A Broadtailed Parrakeet fights partly also for the joy of conflict
but mainly because he is a bird with a strong territorial instinct who
believes that trespassers must be, not merely prosecuted, but persecuted
to the death. As a general rule birds which fight for fun or for territory
are cowed into almost perfect amiability by hardship and misfortune.
Their pugnacity increases as their happiness and contentment with their
surroundings increase and it declines as they decline.
The Masked Lovebird is the exact opposite. As long as he is living
in a nice big aviary with plenty of nesting accommodation, he may,
unlike his cousin the Peachface, behave with tolerable decency towards
his own kind (I would not trust him in mixed company under any
circumstances) ; but catch him and make him a close prisoner, cramp
him in a .cage and torment him with many journeys and his worst
passions are aroused and murder is done.

The world is out of joint,
0 cursed spite !
I&apos;ll see you dead, you fool,
Before to-night.
Therefore if you contemplate sending adult Masked Lovebirds
by rail, you will be wise to pack them separately and anyhow not to
mix pairs.
The first four Personata to reach me were among the earliest lot
to arrive in England. The short journey from London to Havant was
too much for tempers .already exasperated by much voyaging and
the opening of the box revealed a torn and dying bird. Of the three
survivors two proved to be suffering from a kind of French moult and I
wasted several weeks waiting in vain for their flight feathers to grow.
July was therefore almost in before I was equipped with four sound
birds which are, I think, one cock and three hens. These I turned
into one of my movable Parrakeet aviaries 24 ft. X 8 ft. X 8 ft.,
providing in the flight a couple of hollow logs hung up in a horizontal
position.
In their calls and general behaviour the birds bear a close resemblance
to Black-cheeks, but being excessively wild it was difficult to observe
them closely. Early in August they settled down to nesting operations,
carrying fine twigs into one of the logs. I cannot be absolutely certain
but my impression is that the hen carries the material in her beak and
alone incubates, being fed by her mate.
In due course the four eggs hatched, and my aviary attendant tells
me that the young were almost naked when about a week old. When
her family were small the hen and sometimes her mate also used to
rush into the log whenever a person approached the aviary, but when
the young were nearly fledged they discontinued the habit. After the
hatching of the eggs the parents continued to add building material
until a sheaf of leafy twigs projected from the entrance hole.
The young birds were very silent and I never heard them being fed.
About eight weeks after incubation began the first young bird was
found on the ground below the nest, fully fledged, but unable to fly.
In colour it was only slightly duller than its parents. I put it into the
aviary shelter, but I do not think the old birds fed it, nor did it feed

20 Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of the Masked Lovebird
itself, and it died the following day. The next two I brought into the
house. They refused to respond to my efforts at hand feeding, and after
thirty-six hours starvation began to feed themselves, eating first small
brown bread crumbs.and later cracked soaked hemp and shelled soaked
sunflower. On this diet they throve, and it would now be difficult to
distinguish them from adult birds. A fourth young one left the nest
some days after the rest, but it had apparently contracted a bad
chill, and died the next day. Two of the young on leaving the nest
had a little black at the base of the upper mandible, but the beaks of
the others were wholly red like those of adults.
About a month after the first hen began to sit a second took possession
of the other log and now has several young. As no cock ever sits at the
entrance of her home I am inclined to think that the family are the
result of a bigamous union of which the one male is somewhat ashamed !
Unlike her neighbour, the second hen has added no material to the nest
since her family arrived, either because her ideas as to what constitutes
a sufficiency of bedding are different, or because the bundle opposite
is the result of the labours of her neglectful lover.
It was rather amusing to notice how early the young Lovebirds
developed the irascible temperament of their race. When they were
first brought in they spent most of their time sleeping and preening
their feathers, but as the hours passed and no parents appeared to feed
them they began to get discontented and made strenuous efforts to
escape from their cage. As the younger one was trying to scratch his
way out at one corner his elder brother accidentally trampled on him.
In a moment he turned on him in a perfect fury and there was a fine
battle which was not attended by any serious results only because the
combatants' power to inflict damage was by no means equal to their
will. A similar display of ill-humour took place a few days later when
a young Budgerigar trod on a Lovebird's tail, and got in his way when
he was feeding. The adult birds eat hemp, sunflower, oats, canary, and
millet, and, like many Parrakeets, are particularly fond of oats thrown
on the ground of the aviary flight to sprout on the damp earth. These
are most relished at the early stage when they have become soft but
before they have made any growth at all.

In 1926 my friend Mr. Delacour gave me a pair of these handsome
Pigeons, which he had brought back from Indo-China. I turned
them out into a large aviary, with a lot of other birds, and they did
splendidly all last winter, and seem very hardy birds. Last June they
built a nest in a basket, which was placed inside the sheltered part of
the aviary. As the birds were very wild I left them severely alone,
with the result that I was not able to make many observations. Generally
I found one bird on the nest, while the other sat close by, but the moment
I went into the aviary, both birds flew out. About the end of the
month a young bird fully fledged left the nest, but the parents refused
to feed it, so I put it in a cage and tried to hand rear it, but without
success, and it died after a couple of days. This was a great disappoint-
ment, as I was afraid I would have to wait till next summer before
breeding them. In September, I was surprised to find one of the birds
on the nest again. In October a fine healthy young pigeon left the
nest, and this time was well looked after by the parents. It seems
indifferent to the cold, and is as strong as the parents, and practically
the same colour. This fine bird is found in Hainan in French Indo-
China and is a darker bird than the typical form from the Malay
States, and the M. tusalia from India. In captivity these birds
seem to lay only one egg at a sitting. Madame Lecallier bred the
Malay form last year, and again this year, and each time only one
young. I believe this is the first time this bird has been bred in
Europe. The under parts of the male bird are barred chestnut and
black. Under parts vinous buff with lilac reflection. Head, chin, and
throat buff, neck and mantle with green and violet reflections. In the
hen bird the upper parts are similar to those of the cock, but she
differs in having the under parts barred with brownish black.

By A. F. Moody
As of possible interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine I
record that on 21st October there died in the Lilford collection a male
Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis) acquired during 1886 and therefore
41 years old. There is no record as to whether it was adult or immature
when received, but assuming it to be a bird of one year it is at least of
the age mentioned. This example, an old favourite, unlike other Eagles
living here, was very tame, apparently finding pleasure in following
one about the floor of its aviary and allowing itself to be stroked,
uttering the while a succession of short barking grunts. Death appeared
to take place during&apos; sleep, but it was noticeable that a few months
prior to this its eyes became dull and its eyesight defective.
As a further tribute to the care of their late keeper, Mr. K. Cosgrave,
may I also record that amongst other and older veterans living in the
collection, there still thrives a male American Wigeon (Mareca americana)
which has already lived 22 years in this country. This bird, apparently
wild caught when in the adult plumage, was one of six newly imported
birds (two males and four females) received by Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
of Secrupston Hill, East Yorks, during the autumn of 1905. It was by
the writer privately marked before being dispatched from the Secrupston
to the Lilford collection on 15th September, 1908.
Mr. St. Quintin has recorded in the Avicultural Magazine, N.S.,
vol. v, p. 203, the breeding of this species for the first time in confine-
ment in this country, rearing three during the summer of 1906. During
later years these birds and their descendants bred freely, and as the writer
is unaware of any later importations except four drakes and two ducks
imported by Messrs. McLean and Wormald in 1924, the aged male
referred to is of special interest as being one of the parents from which
the English bred stock of American Wigeon have sprung.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998354375" page_id="56185688"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
The present popularity of the Budgerigar, has called forth a seventh
edition of Dr. Karl Russ' book on this bird, the new edition being
edited and brought up to date by Herr Karl Neunzig, and the transla-
tion by Dr. M. Burgers has been published by Cage Birds ( 65 . net).
The book deals exhaustively with the history of this Parrakeet,
its wild life in Australia and first importation into Europe, its food,
health, ailments, and breeding in captivity, while there is a very
useful chapter on the breeding of colour varieties and an explanation
of the laws of heredity as brought to light by Mendel's famous experi-
ments on sweet peas.
It is rightly shown that breeding for colour varieties must be
systematically carried out with a definite object in view, and that a
knowledge of the laws of heredity must be acquired by those who would
succeed, but we may warn our readers that they must not be surprised
if the Mendelian laws do not altogether work out as they are expected
to do. We know that when breeding from heterozygotes we should
obtain 50 per cent of similar heterozygotes, 25 per cent of the dominant,
and 25 per cent of the recessive homozygotes. In other words, in a full
brood from blue-bred parents there should be 50 per cent of blue-bred
green, 25 per cent of pure green, and 25 per cent of pure blue. But in
practice we find that some full nests of six or seven birds contain only
green birds, while others of perhaps four or five young will contain one
or even two blues. But with a number of pairs and over a whole season
the percentage will probably be found to be more or less correct.
We are advised, and this advice has often been given by others,
that no bird should be bred from until it is twelve months old. No
doubt this is on the whole good advice, especially if applied to late-
hatched birds, but our experience with early-hatched birds has been
that the young produced from parents of less than six months old are
some of the largest and strongest birds that one has seen.
We strongly advise Budgerigar enthusiasts to invest in this book,
which contains much that will be found useful.

about a week old in the nest. These birds are breeding in a large cage,
the same in which I have bred other species of Lovebirds and Cockatiels,

NESTING MATERIAL FOR LOVEBIRDS

Sir,- --I have seen the family Agapornis accredited with using such
a curious assortment of nesting materials--leaves, grass, twigs, groundsel,
and paper shavings, to mention but a few--that I think it might be of
assistance to those who are attempting to breed members of this genus
for the first time to mention a reliable material for their nests. I have
found young lime branches to be eagerly stripped by Black-cheeks,
Peach-faces, Masked and Nyasa Lovebirds, and with these strips of
bark they are able to make quite cleverly-constructed nests, probably
because it peels easily and in long pliable strips. Lime possesses the
additional advantage of being very full of sap, so that its bark tends to
keep the nest moist, even in an indoor shelter. A pair of Masked
Lovebirds in my possession ignored poplar branches, and seemed only
moderately amused with some hazel twigs which they carried up to
the entrance hole of their nest-box, but failed to get inside.
Finally I gave them some lime, which had had to be fetched from
some distance, and this they fell upon at once, stripping it bare and
completing a nest of it in a few days.
In my letter re Rosy-faced Lovebirds in the December number
there occurs the sentence " as I recently possessed an abnormal pair,
of which the hen was not only the larger, which is not usual," etc.
This, I think, is a misprint, as in my original letter I said, or, anyway,
intended to say, " not only the larger, which is not unusual ."

On 23rd December, 1927, Mr. Chapman received a collection from
Tanganyika in which was a Bine Lovebird. He kindly invited me to
call and see it, which I lost no time in doing. I saw at once that it was
a Masked Lovebird (Agapornis personata ) in which the yellow coloration
of the normal bird was absent, the dark pigment being retained, those
areas of the body normally coloured green were blue, while the broad
yellow collar of the typical bird was replaced by a white one. The bill
was of a rosy flesh-colour and the feet light grey.
Mr. Chapman most generously offered to defray the cost of the
production of a coloured plate of this rarity for the Avicultural
Magazine, and allowed me to take charge of the bird while this was
being prepared; and it is thanks to him, Mr. Rowland Green, and
Messrs. Bale, Son and Danielsson that it has been possible to produce
this plate and publish it in record time.
For a newly imported Lovebird the specimen is extremely tame,
which may be due to the fact that it was brought home in a separate
small cage. Otherwise one might suppose that it had been bred in

captivity by some enterprising aviculturist in Tanganyika Territory;
but Mr. Chapman tells me that without doubt it was captured wild,
and it may be that in some parts of the range of A. per sonata this
beautiful sport is breeding and eventually a blue race of the species
may be established. It may be possible to establish such a race in
captivity, and every endeavour will be made to do so by the Zoological
Society who have acquired'this very interesting bird. It appears to
be a female, but its plumage is.imperfect at present and it will need to
moult before it can be expected to breed.

BIRD KEEPING IN PEKING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98301875" page_id="56185701"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour
There is no doubt that the Chinese, and particularly the Mandchus,
are as fond of bird keeping as any other people in the world, but they
are a very special kind of bird lover. Unlike us or the Japanese, they
never try to breed birds or to keep them in aviaries--they only keep
birds as pets, but in this way they are far ahead of all others. In the
streets of Peking almost one man out of three carries a cage, or a perch,
on which a bird is tied--for the sole object of taking his pets on
" promenade ", for fresh air and sun.
Naturally all these pet birds, unless freshly caught, are in perfect
condition and feather, and exceedingly tame. Only those in such a
form are prized in China. In no other country, of course, is so much time
devoted to a bird. If many passers-by have birds with them, it is safe
to say that every house possesses, at least, one cage which on warm
days is hung outside the front door.
In China birds are kept and fed in a very different way to that in which
they are treated in Europe and even in Japan, and no doubt many of
our members will be surprised by the following information. There
are two ways of accommodating birds, cages and stands.&apos; Chinese cages
are nearly always round in shape, most skilfully and artistically made
of wood or bamboo. Many are adorned with carvings, especially on
their doors. Naturally there are exceedingly fine ones, made of precious
materials, which are worth hundreds of dollars, but these are outside
the scope of ordinary aviculture. Cages are generally rather low, except

for such birds as Laughing Thrushes (Trochalopterum canorum) and
Mynahs. All are meant to hang up by a big brass or wood hook, often
prettily chiselled. Cages for seed-eaters have a wooden bottom ; those
for insectivorous birds have a barred one, through which refusefallsout.
For Larks there is a little platform in the middle, while nestling birds
have carefully selected twigs, generally twisted, often with carved
ivory or bone tips and covered with shark's skin, the effect of which is
beneficial to birds in giving them a better grip. The middle half of the
cage top is of solid wood, and a round piece of paper fixed on canvas is
put on the inside of this and sewed to the next bars ; it is decorated
with ornamental drawings and changed now and then. Food and water
are put into pretty little china pots, of different sizes and shapes,
which are most decorative. Water is often hung outside the cage in
special brass or china receptacles. The average price of a cage, furnished
with all fittings, is&apos; 2s. to 10s.
Bird stands are made of small branches of hard wood, about Jin. thick,
chosen for their knots, and nicely coloured and shaped, more or less
straight, with a rough branch at the top ; the latter is cut about 4 inches
long and covered with a cotton or silk string, curled around, so that
it provides a soft perch for the bird's feet. The other end of the stand
has a strong brass or steel point, which allows one to stick it in the
ground or in a pot. Birds are tied on the stand by a light silk or cotton
string, divided in two by a little brass swivel, which prevents
the birds entangling themselves, one end of which is fastened on the
stand, while the other is tied round the bird's neck in such a way that
it cannot become too tight.
All birds kept in China are wild caught, only Mongolian Larks and
a few others being taken from the nests. Seed-eaters are caged at once,
but insectivorous birds are first kept on the stands, which is a wonderful
means of taming them. Food is offered to them on a special bamboo
spoon, and I was assured by Chinese bird-lovers that none ever
refuses to feed right from the time of his capture. They are fed in
this way every ten minutes. It takes about a fortnight to tame a young
bird of the year, and one month for an adult. Afterwards they can be
put into a cage. But this sort of bird is always put again on the stand
for a few hours each day and taken out for a walk, and therefore keeps

its necktie all the time. Sometimes the bird is put on a small perch
fastened at both ends to two vertical bamboos, which are themselves
fastened to a small wood or bamboo box, forming a tray underneath the
perch.
In Peking one finds only native birds, with the exception of a few
Laughing Thrushes and Mynahs. Birds, cages, and the many special
implements--food-pots, spoons, stands, etc.--are offered in various
markets, some daily, others, more important, occurring at fixed dates.
They are most interesting, as not only numbers of birds are brought
for sale, but hundreds of fanciers come and look round, carrying their
own pets. The autumn is naturally the best season, as numbers of
migrants are then caught. It is the time when one replenishes his cages,
and we were lucky to be in Peking in October, which is just the right
time.
Only a few species of birds are kept in North China. The most
popular one is the Mongolian Lark (Melanocorypha mongolica). They
are brought by thousands as fledglings from the Mongolian plateau
in the summer, and are praised for their powerful voice. Fanciers carry
them about everywhere, in their low round cages, each covered with a
dark blue cloth. When at a suitable place, they uncover the cage and
make the bird sing, regular singing competitions being held in the
streets and parks. Crested- and Sky-larks are occasionally kept.
Among Finches, Siskins are the most popular ; one sees also Chinese
Greenfinches ( Chloris sinica), Crossbills, and even Tree Sparrows,
although the latter are as common in Peking as our English Sparrow
is in London or Paris. A special mention must be made of the Masked
Grosbeak ( Eophona per sonata), a fine big grey bird, with black face,
wings, and tail, and an enormous yellow bill. Quiet and sensible, they
become so tame as to be carried on a stick tied by the leg, and are trained
to catch on the wing a seed of hemp. No nicer pet can be seen.
Among insectivorous birds, the two most popular are the
Red Spotted Blue-throat ( Cyanosylva suecica rohusta ) and the Ruby-
throat ( Calliope calliope) ; there are also many Daurian Redstarts
(Phoenicurus auroreus) and some Blue Chats ( Larvivora cyanea),
Swinhoe's Robins ( L . sibilans), Red-flanked Blue-tails ( lanthia
cyanura), and Red Warblers ( Acrocephalus orientalis). Great and

Coal Tits are also kept, as well as Isabellene Shrikes ( Lanius
isabellinus), Blue Magpies (Cyanopica cyanus). Bed-flanked Zosterops
(Z. erythropleurus) are also very numerous, and are the cheapest
birds in the autumn. Outside the above-mentioned species, birds of
prey are the only attractive ones to Chinese, or, rather, Mandchu,
eyes. There are always some in the bird markets, hooded and
kept on perches. Five species are represented: the Goshawk,
the Sparrow Hawk, the Besra Sparrow Hawk, and two Falcons.
All are trained to catch birds and mammals.
Seed-eaters are fed on a very small millet, with the exception of the
Crossbills and Grosbeaks, which receive hemp. Larks are also fed on
millet, often husked, green food, and a little paste made of boiled yolk
of eggs and soya bean flour. Insectivorous birds are all fed on a mixture
made as follows : . Cut up meat (preferably mutton) and put to soak
in a little water for several hours, then a powder made of boiled yolk
of egg and soya bean flour is added. For newly caught birds the mixture
is made rather liquid and no drinking water is supplied. Only at the
moulting season a few insects are added. Birds do beautifully on this
food, and I have seen Blue and Buby-throats so fed four and five years
in captivity, in the best possible health. For Zosterops it is simpler
still, as they are fed on nothing but dry soya bean flour, and do very
well on it.
When we left Peking for Japan we brought with us several dozen
of Bed-flanked Zosterops, thirty-five Blue Magpies, a dozen Larks,
and as many Blue-throats and Buby-throats, a pet Grosbeak, a tame
Shrike, a dozen Chinese Greenfinches, and a few others. To them we
added at Dairen (Manchuria) lots of Hemipodes (Turnix maculatus) and
five charming North Chinese Babblers (Thopophilus pekinensis). Some
of these birds will remain in friends' aviaries in Japan, while others
will, I hope, arrive in France and in England.

This little Suthora is kept by the Chinese as a cage bird only on
account of its ability to be trained for fighting, as it has neither song
nor brilliant plumage to make it attractive to the ordinary Chinese,
who usually values a bird upon these two qualities only.
The fights usually take place in a tea-house or other public place,
and considerable sums of money are bet by the owners and supporters
as to which bird will win. The " sport " is very popular, and a bird
with a known reputation as a fighter will often be valued at over a
thousand dollars.
The contestants are placed in a cage and allowed to fight until one
is so exhausted as to be unable to continue to fight, or is so outclassed
that it stops fighting and endeavours to escape. The birds are then
returned to their cages and the bets paid.
In a wild state the habits of these birds are very similar to those of
the familiar English Blue Tit, and small flocks of from four to twenty
may be seen in the autumn working their way through thick under-
growth or along a garden hedge in search of insects and seeds, upon
which they feed. The nest is usually built in a bush or reed bed, and often
two broods a year are raised, the family keeping together until the
following spring.
In a cage or aviary these little birds are most attractive, and soon
become tame. They are easily fed, and do quite well on small red millet
seed and a few insects daily. I also give mine a little moist sponge-cake,
which they seem to like for a change, although the Chinese feed them
only on red millet and dry bean or corn flour. Unripe seeds, soaked
millet sprays, and fruit are also eaten in small quantities. The birds
should do well and breed freely in aviaries in England, as they are
hardy and able to stand the wet, cold winters of the Yangtze valley,
which are very similar to the English winter.
I am sending home some of these birds to the London Zoological
Society, and I hope they will arrive safely, so that those members who
are not fortunate enough to obtain birds for their own aviaries may be

has previously been shown.
Crowtits are very fond of bathing, and should also be provided with
a nesting-box or travelling cage half filled with hay into which they
may retire. Although when trained they become very desperate
fighters, the wild birds are very peaceable and gentle, and are quite safe
inmates for any mixed aviary.

A not uninteresting side-line in avicultural experience is the varying
ability of escaped or strayed foreign birds to fend for themselves when
receiving no artificial aid.
Insectivorous kinds pick up an easy living almost anywhere as long
as warm weather lasts, but the winter usually brings them and their
food supply to an untimely end. Gallinaceous birds and Waterfowl,
provided they can stand cold, find food with little more difficulty than
native species, and survive until they meet a violent end, generally
from man or fox. The hardier Cranes get on well as long as the ground
is soft, but a severe frost reduces them to serious straits where they
can get no artificial feeds of grain.
Flamingoes have proved their ability to survive the winter, and,
what is more, the persistent attacks of wildfowlers on an English coast.
Pekin Robins, whose natural diet closely resembles that of our own
Hedge Sparrow, seem equally well able to look after themselves in
suitable cover, even in severe weather. Finches, Buntings, and Waxbills
can all shift for themselves as long as insects and seeding grass are
abundant, but I know of no instance of any tropical Finch surviving

the winter without artificial aid. Foreign Doves and Pigeons are not
often picked up in a starving condition when they stray from home,
but, with the exception of the Triangular and South American Spotted
Pigeons and one or two of the African Turtle Doves, I do not know of
any which have shown noticeable ability to maintain themselves in an
entirely wild state.
As might be expected, the days of exotic birds of prey which gain
their freedom are apt to be few and evil. Either captivity has deprived
them of their hunting gifts, in which case they quickly starve, or, by
too successful operations against game or poultry, they find themselves
in fatal proximity to a gun.
Parrot-like birds show great variability in their power of shifting
for themselves. Macaws and Black Cockatoos, deprived of artificial
food, last only so long as their not inconsiderable powers of fasting
permit. Amazon Parrots get on much better, and, though I do not
think that an Amazon would survive many days if it made its first
escape in winter, there are, I believe, recorded instances of Amazons
which have learned their way about during the more genial season,
ultimately supporting themselves the whole year round. Both Sulphur-
crested and Boseate Cockatoos have, I believe, spent a whole year at
complete liberty without artificial feeding, but I should be interested
to find out how they manage in heavy snow, as they are not normally
bud-eaters.
While the little Plum-headed Parrakeet quickly perishes if it escapes
from its aviary in winter, there must be quite a number of Ringnecks
of independent means in different parts of the country. Two have paid
me a visit within recent years, and neither artificial food nor the com-
panionship of their kind induced them to make a permanent stay.
Their big cousin, the Alexandrine, is equally able to take care of himself.
A cock turned out of one of my aviaries in December went away the
same evening and was not seen for a fortnight, when he was observed
10 miles away on his homeward journey. He came back as hearty and
strong as he started, and not in the least starved or tired.
KingParrakeets are, during the winter months, dependent for a long
time on artificial feeding, but after two or three years at liberty they
may learn to keep themselves entirely on wild food.

Barrabands and Rock Peplars cannot as a rule support themselves,
and even in summer are often soon reduced to starvation when their
seed supply is lost.
The big Broadtails and Blue-bonnets succeed in making a living at
almost any time of year, and, being largely bud-eaters, may come
through severe weather in better fettle than our own British birds.
I have known Adelaides to live and breed for ten years in an entirely
wild state. Redrumps and their near allies, on the other hand, can only
find food in summer and early autumn, and a Cockatiel that strays
in winter is a dead bird within four days. Budgerigars, also, cannot
support themselves on genuine wild food in winter, but they have
some of the Sparrow's ability to discover, in times of scarcity, the refuse
grain of stable and poultry yard.
It would be very, interesting if some sort of census could be made
of foreign birds at the present time living in a wild and ownerless
state, together with some account of their habits and the time they
are known to have been at liberty. I fancy the number and variety
would be greater than one would expect.

The account of a so-called Dodo, by Sir Hamon Lestrange, who saw
the bird exhibited alive in London about 1638, appears really to refer
to the Solitaire. He says it was " a great fowle somewhat bigger than
the largest Turkey Cock, and so legged and footed, but stouter and
thicker and of a more erect shape, coloured before like a yong cock
fesan, and on the back of dunn or deare colour. The keeper called it a
Dodo . .
It will be noticed that the colour here described is not right for a
Dodo, which was also not of an erect shape, and was far shorter-
legged than a Turkey. Most important of all, no mention is made of
the huge and heavily hooked beak.
The Solitaire was a browner bird, in shape fairly conforming to the

above description, and with a beak which, though powerful, would not
attract especial attention--it was not unlike a Condor's.
The bird figured in " The Hunting of the Dodo "---the old Italian
feather-picture reproduced in Dr. Casey Wood's interesting paper in
the I his for 1927 (p. 724, pi. xix)--is also evidently a Solitaire, if it
be not a mere imaginative adaptation of an Ostrich, which seems to me
more likely from the form of the feet, which are not to be taken for any
other bird's. Moreover, the bird is being hunted by a horseman with a
scimitar, and is nearly half as big as the horse, so the taxidermist-
artist Minaggio evidently made the bird up from his ideas of the Ostrich,
to which scientists even long after thought the Dodo to be allied,
much as ancient naturalists mixed up the Oryx antelope with the
Indian rhinoceros and the narwhal to make the unicorn.
That the Dodo and Solitaire should have been confused is only
what might have been expected, both being big flightless island birds.
We know the Great Auk was the original " Penguin ", and that Rheas
have been for centuries called Ostriches in their own country.
Doubt was recently expressed by a distinguished scientist as to
whether the Dodo could have developed by natural selection. I see
no difficulty here, and have expressed my views in an article " The
Dodo's lesson to Democracy " (Graphic, 6th February, 1926).
Briefly my argument is this : The Dodo and Solitaire found them-
selves in an environment where no enemies existed to make them use
their wings and their wits. Hence " one was as good as another ",
and brute force of beak or knobbed wings was developed by the natural
selection of large coarse types, while flight was lost, being unnecessary.
Savery's pictures of the Dodo were evidently drawn from a live
captive bird ; that in the picture owned by the Zoological Society
is remarkably vivid and far the best of all Dodo portraits ; the bird is
shown with the stern facing the spectator, and the head turned round
to chew an uplifted foot. It would be interesting to know if the Dodo
cleaned its toes as, I believe, some Parrots and Birds of Prey do, or if
it played with them like the Great Indian Hornbill now at the Zoo.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
After an interval of some years I have succeeded in obtaining two
more examples of the rarest of the Fijian Parrakeets, Pyrrhulopsis
personata, a species which is said to be threatened with extinction
through the hostility of fruit-growers and the ravages of the imported
mongoose. The Masked Parrakeet is a large bird, whose prevailing
colour is a rich glittering green, with blue flights and a blue-green tail
the beak and mask are black, while a not very wide strip of yellow runs
down the centre of the breast from below the chin and deepens into
orange on the abdomen. My first bird--a very old one--had an orange
iris, and the eye of the younger of the new arrivals is of the same colour.
The other, however, has wonderful ruby eyes, and as it appears from its
actions to be a cock, it may be that the colour of the iris is an indication
of sex. Now that it is recovering from the effects of its journey, it is
becoming lively and sociable, repeating a few words fairly distinctly,
and showing special pleasure and excitement at the approach of ladies,
whom it attempts to feed. So far the only natural cry I have heard from
it is one resembling the soft call sometimes used by P. splendens, but
as my old " Georgie " screeched hideously in moments of excitement,
it is probable that this less agreeable accomplishment js being held in
reserve. The second new arrival is shy and in very bad plumage,
although it appears in good health in other respects. The Pyrrhulopsis
Parrakeets are gorgeously coloured birds, lively in their behaviour, and,
when tame, fair talkers and sociable and amusing, if not always gentle,
companions. Unfortunately, however, though well adapted to aviary
life in more genial climates, they thrive but indifferently with us, usually
falling victims to tuberculosis or chronic enteritis in spite of the best
of care and attention. Although sometimes classed with the King
Parrakeets they bear not the slightest resemblance to this group in
their general habits, which are in many ways distinctive and peculiar.
The Masked Parrakeet has a peculiar musty and rather goaty odour,
pronounced, but not sufficiently so to be actively unpleasant.

By C. H. Macklin, M.R.C.S.
In view of their present comparative scarcity, it might interest
members to hear about my breeding results with Gouldian Finches
(Pcephila mirabilis and P. gouldice). I believe none have been imported
for two years.
I obtained two pairs in the spring of 1924. Two Black-headed hens,
reputed aviary bred in England, a Red-headed and a Black-headed
cock, imported. Both pairs nested in August, half filling coco-nut
shell nests with grass, moss, small twigs, and feathers. The nests were
hung near the roof of the inside shelter of a garden aviary.
The Red-headed cock and his mate brought off two youngsters
from a clutch of five, the other three eggs being clear. These two young
birds died during a spell of wet weather about a month after leaving
the nest.
The other pair hatched four young birds, which were getting well
feathered when the hen died suddenly ; the cock continued to feed,
and all four nestlings flew, but the effort was too much for the cock,
and they all died.
As it was getting late in the year, I brought the three survivors
indoors for the winter. This was quite unnecessary, for these three
birds have been outside for two winters, and are still in perfect health
and feather.
In 1925 the same pair, Red-headed cock and Black-headed hen,
successfully reared two youngsters, a cock and hen, both good specimens
of the Red-headed variety. The odd Black-headed cock helped feed
the young after they had left the nest.
In 1926 this pair had two nests, rearing two young in August and
four late in October. The latter flew during the first week in November,
and all turned out healthy birds, which speaks well for their hardiness
in this climate.
The odd old cock paired up with the 1925 hen, but she would not

sit on her five eggs, laid in September. One of the six young birds
died during the winter, so that last spring I was left with the three old
birds, two 1925, and five 1926 hatched young.
In September, 1927, the original pair hatched out a brood of six,
and reared five. The other mated pair again refused to sit on two
clutches of eggs. On cleaning out the nesting places I found no less than
thirty-two eggs, all Gouldians ; I think the reason for their not having
been incubated was too many pairs in the same aviary and the young
hens being disturbed.
I parted with one pair of the 1926 birds, so am now left with a little
flock of twelve, seven adult, a delightful sight; they are very tame
and allow even strangers to watch them closely.
The old breeding pair have fully reared fifteen birds out of eighteen
hatched in six nests in four seasons ; of these there were seven Red-
headed (three cocks, four hens) and five Black-headed (two cocks,
three hens) ; the other three died in nest plumage.
The full adult plumage is assumed at the first moult, at about
eight months old. The head colour and sex can be distinguished at
about three to four months.* The head colours are either pure red or
pure black, not intermediate; the young red cocks are indistinguishable
from their wild-bred father. The young birds have been chiefly reared
on white and spray millet seed. Soft food was always untouched, but
the old birds took a lot of grass, eating the new shoots of lawn turf
kept cut short. I never saw insects taken, but one year the hen took
very small snails which she found in the turf, hammering them open
like a Thrush. I believe that turf kept cut short is the chief reason for
success ; the first year, when no young survived, they had none.
An interesting point about the nestlings is their luminous mouths ;
there are four luminous spots inside the mouth, which give a most
curious effect on looking into the dark nest when the young gape
for food.
I should be very glad if any other member who has bred Gouldians
would exchange two or three young ones with me to avoid inbreeding.
If one or two would take up the breeding of these most attractive, but
less commonly imported Australian Finches, we might become
indifferent to the export restrictions now in force.

There are various degrees of this disease, some of which are so slight
that the young bird recovers and becomes outwardly perfect, while
other birds are so extremely affected that it is best to destroy them
before they attempt to leave the nest.
The following is, I think, a fairly good and explanatory classification :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923320583333333" page_id="56185719"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
(1) The young bird leaves the nest in apparently perfect condition,
but after a few days the long feathers of the tail and wings, including
the primaries and secondaries, fall out or snap off, and the bird becomes
what is known in the trade as a " runner
(2) The young bird leaves the nest with the body fully feathered,
but the primaries and perhaps the secondaries, and also the tail feathers,
are absent, and the bird, of course, cannot fly.
(3) The nestling at three to five weeks is almost as naked as the day
on which it was hatched. There may be a few feathers or quills on the
anterior part of the skull. The wings and tail show a few short quills,
and the feathers if present are twisted and distorted and soon fall out.
My experience has been that birds falling under the headings (1)

and (2) often recover completely, though it is doubtful whether it is
wise to breed from them, however healthy they may look.
I have fortunately had little experience of class (3), but there are
some aviaries, which, though well-known, shall be nameless, where

affect the whole nest, and also the first, second, and third nests equally,
whereas it is known that the later nests are the most prone to produce
imperfect young. The converse does occasionally happen, the early
nestlings being weaklings, while those hatched in autumn are healthy.
If we consider the condition a " deficiency disease " produced by
the lack of some essential foodstuff or vitamin, allied to rickets in other
animals, we can ask why is not the whole brood and every brood
affected, seeing that the feeding conditions and the general surroundings
are identical in each case.
Many breeders will speak glibly of parasites affecting the quills, and
of painting these with paraffin, iodine, etc. All this is, I feel sure, sheer
nonsense. I have worked on this subject for the last year or two, and
have tried various foodstuffs and drugs, amongst the latter more
especially cod liver oil, iron, thyroid gland, and iodine, also preparations,
said to be rich in vitamins B and C. I cannot say that any of my
experiments have been sufficiently successful to claim any advance on
our knowledge of this disease. Observation, however, has taught me
a few facts.
(1) The young when affected remain in the nest-box longer than
they should, and it is &apos;possible that this causes the parents, who are
anxious to nest again, to bite off the quills and otherwise harass the
young, thus making bad worse. Feathers so destroyed should, of course,
grow again at the next moult.
Certain it is that nest-boxes containing such young always show a
large number of loose stumpy feathers and quills.
(2) After leaving the nest these flightless young birds are con-
stantly preening their " wings " and " tails ", or what remains of them,
as if there were some constant irritation, and I have seen fully formed
and promising feathers deliberately bitten off, leaving bleeding stumps.
As I said in the last number of the Magazine, I have of late, in the
third round, had my full share of French moult, and not wishing to
continue breeding these deformities, I took several fully grown young
which were beginning to drop their feathers ruthlessly out of their
nests and caged them with their parents. Those that were well fed
ceased to moult, but a few who had to fend for themselves continued to
drop feathers and quills and became " runners

(3) This is the most interesting part of my experience. When
catching up my birds at the end of the season I found that two early
hatched 1927 hens were on eggs. Their previous nests (two in each
case) had given me 75 per cent of weaklings. Without much hope I
took their eggs and placed them under two common Green hens, each
of which was incubating her first clutch for the year. Much to my
delight and surprise, one of these hens has brought off four perfect
Blues, which left the nest some ten days ago--the other has two Blues
and a Green in perfect plumage, which should fly at any moment.
(4) French moult more frequently appears in the autumn than in
the spring, and is of more frequent occurrence with very young hens
than with those one, two, or even three years old. It is often seen to
occur also if the hen is for any reason in partial moult, having dropped
a few wing feathers, for instance.
My conclusions from the above facts and observations are that the
disease in question is due to fatigue on the part of the parent or parents,
who cease to feed their young sufficiently fully and frequently. To this
must be added the fact that the autumnal days are very much shorter.
Possibly there is also an element of boredom and a desire to get the
job over and to start a fresh clutch.
It is easy to realize that the frequent journeys from the nest to the
feeding tray and back, dozens of times daily for weeks on end, must,
indeed, be hard labour, especially to a bird which through the lack of
two or three flight feathers is a trifle weak in flight.
I think I am right in saying that the wild Budgerigar of the
Australian bush only breeds for three months of the year. This cannot
mean more than two nests at the most, and the same applies at first to
such birds when imported into Europe. The tendency on the part of
the Budgerigar to breed all the year round if allowed so to do, is
therefore an acquired characteristic and may account for the tendency
to neglect the young in order to start a new nest.
An extreme example of this loss of maternal instinct, combined with
an excessive production of eggs, is found in the light breeds of poultry
(e.g. Leghorns), who not only make bad mothers, but who very rarely
can be induced to sit out the full period of incubation.
If my deductions are at all correct, there seems to be only one

remedy for the trouble in question, namely, sufficient rest, together
with every endeavour to build up a really healthy and vigorous strain
of birds. Complete rest from all nesting or breeding activities can only
be obtained by removing all nest-boxes and separating the sexes for
several months, say, from November to March. This will give the birds
ample time to rear three broods a year. The use of cages and more
especially of artificial heat during the winter, are a mistake. It is
important that the birds, more especially the hens, should have as much
flying room as possible in order to be thoroughly fit for the coming
season. Exercise and exposure to weather are probably the two best
preventives of egg-binding, therefore let your birds have the largest
possible aviary and a few hours at least in the outer flight each day,
unless the weather is really impossible.
Should any other member have any definite views on the subject,
which I fear I have treated at too great length, I hope the Editor will
allow further discussion in the Magazine, if only to help avert the great
wastage of young Budgerigars which is at present taking place.

<bodyText confidence="0.983505" page_id="56185722"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
By James B. Housden
After my long railway journey of nearly 3,000 miles, I reached
my brother's home in south-west Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico.
I was awake very early next morning, and the first sounds I heard in
the forest came from thousands of crickets, cicades, and tree
frogs ; and the cries of distant night birds were the sounds that
broke the stillness.
I was anxious to see the birds in their native haunts, and the
first bird I saw near my window was the American Mocking-bird ;
this bird was quite tame and had a fascination absolutely its own ;
especially when exploring for the first time in a new part of the forest.
The Mocker, as this bird is called, is a favourite, being so tame, not
only because of his own beautiful song, his powers of imitation, and
his pretty ways and elegant form, but also because he loves the society
of man, and will build his home near that of man ; 1 have watched
this bird many times searching for grasshoppers near my feet on the

lawn, He always seems animated and His motions are rapid and
graceful.
Someone lias said : " He who has not heard the wild singing
of the Mocking-bird has missed one of the richest treats that Nature
has in her wonderfully rich storehouse.
" Listen to him when the world is hushed, when the air is heavy
with the rich fragrance of orange blossoms and the dewy leaves glisten
in the moonlight, it is then his song will thrill you."
The writer has heard him sing in the morning, at midday, in the
evening, and often through the night, whenever the light of the moon
causes the darkness to wane.
As a mimic this bird has very few equals. No bird notes seem beyond
his compass. He can perfectly imitate them all, from the screech of
the Hawk to the soft and restful notes of the Wood Thrush or the
exquisitely sweet song of the Hermit Thrush.
The musical talent of the Mocking-bird is by no means confined to
mimicry of other birds' songs. He has notes of his own which are rich
and varied which are rapidly delivered with much sweetness and
energy. He seems to enjoy his own voice, for his song is accompanied
by a movement of the wings, tail, and body.
The nest is constructed with twigs, weed stalks, strips of bark, and
I sometimes found in the nest rags and pieces of string. It is lined with
fine rootlets, cotton, feathers, and other soft substances that may
be near at hand. Nests are found in all kinds of strange places ; orange,
peach, cedar trees and in vines and shrubberies near houses.
One pair of Mocking-birds built their nest near the gate of our
garden : the hen was so tame I could almost stroke her as she brooded
over &apos;her eggs, another nest I found near where the cows stood waiting
to be milked, while others were discovered away in the forest.
I shall long remember one cloudless day of June, when the sun
was blazing stiflingly hot, I was exploring a new part of the forest, and
I did not take my bearings at the start, and so got almost hopelessly
lost; I came to a most beautiful part which to any lover of the wild
in Nature would always have a charm peculiar to itself, for its
beauties were many. I came to a log shack, and knocked at the rough
door. A coloured girl answered the knock, then the mother came.

then an old man who understood me. I asked for some water, and the
way out. When he found I was an Englishman, he treated me with
true hospitality, there was some charm about him when he brought
me a large tin bucket of water, and an iron ladle with a long iron
handle; the water was quite warm, but I was thankful; it
seemed to give all the family great pleasure to watch me scooping it
up. He was most kind and was certainly one of Nature&apos;s true gentlemen.
Near the hut, and where the Texas blue bonnet and other
beautiful flowers grew in great profusion, in a small bush I found a
hen Mocking-bird brooding over a nest of five beautifully marked
eggs ; some distance away I found another nest with young, and
throughout the day I found many nests containing eggs.
The eggs are four or five in number^ and there are often two broods
in the course of the year. They are a beautiful greenish hue, spotted
with amber brown.
The Mocking-birds are devoted parents, and ably defend their
eggs and young, especially from one of their greatest foes, the black
snake.
Its breeding range extends from Florida all through the Gulf
States, several other states, and Mexico.
THE TREE OR WHISTLING DUCKS
By J. Delacour
As we have already stated the Tree Ducks form a very distinct
group from the tropical Ducks whether migratory or sedentary. They
live in great flocks and fill the air with shrill cries more like Sparrows
than Ducks. In their ways and habits the Tree Ducks remind us
somewhat of Waders. They swim and dive well, but differently to
other Ducks.
In very cold places they feel hard frost&apos; and it is wise to shut them
up for the winter ; but in the milder parts of France and England they
may stay out all the year round except in unusually cold weather.
Being as a rule very tame and non-migratory, they may usually be
left full-winged and will not abuse the privilege. I must say that all
those which I have kept full-winged for years, though they sometimes
take flight, never stray away.

Imported birds (and almost all are imported birds) do not breed
readily, but once young can be obtained in confinement, they reproduce
themselves abundantly ; each female lays about thirty eggs between
April and August. The young are rather delicate and grow slowly.
Both adults and young are fed like other Ducks. They do not go into
eclipse plumage and the sexes are&apos;identical and impossible to distinguish.
As a rule they are inoffensive birds, but a few males may turn bully*
which may be tiresome, but is not dangerous.
The Tree Ducks are much to be recommended for their tameness,
their handsome plumage and amusing ways. They are certainly
very intelligent.
The White-faced Tree Ducks (Dendrocygna viduata) is found
throughout tropical Africa and South America. This extremely
curious distribution is without a parallel among birds, save in the case
of the Fulvous Tree Duck which is even more remarkable. It has
a very short tail. All the front of the head is white, the rest is black,
together with the neck, back, wings, and abdomen. The upper portions
of the breast, back, and sides are striped black and white, the white
fading into yellow towards the breast; the shoulders are streaked
russet and brown, the mantle brown edged with tawny ; the beak
black with a grey subterminal mark ; feet bluish grey. This species
is common and often imported. It is charmingly tame and artful,
breeds readily, and stays well full-winged.
The Bed-billed Tree Duck (D. autumnalis) inhabits Mexico^
and Central America. Its tail is not quite as short as the preceding,
but it is about the same size. Its head and neck are grey with a brown
streak in the centre ; the abdomen and tail black ; wings pale grey
with black and mahogany coloured flights ; the rest of its plumage
is the same shade, except the subcaudals which are black and whitish ;
bill and feet pink.
The Grey-necked Tree Duck (D. discolor) which is found through-
out the north of South America only differs from the preceding in
having the upper portion of its back and its breast tawny grey
deepening to russet towards the neck, or even mahogany red ; otherwise
it is identical in every way and probably constitutes merely a sub-
species.

These two ducks are very pretty and delightful in confinement
but are possibly rather more susceptible to cold than D. viduata ;
they have occasionally bred in captivity but as a rule are not much
inclined that way. It is not certain that discolor has bred in Europe.
They are pretty freely imported.
The Fulvous Tree Duck (D. fulva) inhabits Mexico, the mouth
of the Orinoco, the South of Brazil, and North Argentina in America ;
the East and South-East of Africa and Madagascar ; India, Ceylon,
and Burma in Asia. This distribution is unique among birds and
quite inexplicable ; there does not appear to be any difference between
individuals from all these diverse regions.
It is slightly larger than the preceding species, has a very short
tail and the back of its head is slightly crested. Its head is tawny
russet, deep brown above and a black stripe runs from the nape to
the back ; the sides of its neck are pale tawny streaked with black ;
under parts reddish tawny ; the feathers on its flanks are long and wide,
deep brown and white ; wings and tail black ; shoulders reddish brown ;
mantle very dark grey with russet; bill and feet dark grey. It is
occasionally imported and has been bred in Europe. It is hardy.
The Wandering Tree Duck (D. arcuata) inhabit Oceania from
Java and the Philippines to S.E. Australia. It is smaller than the
preceding by nearly a half, all the tawny colouring is paler and the sides
of the breast spotted with brown. The sides are bright russet and
the feathers on its black and white flanks are longer and more showy.
It is seldom imported and does not appear to have been bred in Europe.
It is as hardy as the rest.
The Indian Tree Duck (D. javanica) is widely spread throughout
India, Indo-China, and the Malays ; it may be known from the
preceding by its wholly tawny breast and duller and paler coloration
everywhere. The feathers on its flanks are less developed and less
strikingly coloured. It is often imported and is very hardy, but does
not seem to have bred in Europe.
The three remaining species are extremely rare and reach Europe
only accidentally.

has a grey head passing to white under the chin and throat with a

black band from tbe vertex to the back ; a white neck streaked with
black ; the upper parts of the body ticked dark and light brown ;
under parts tawny brown, spotted with black ; flight and tail black ;
beak and feet dark grey. It has been bred by Mr. Blaauw and in the
Zoological Gardens of Cologne.
The Spotted Tree Duck (D. guttata) is a native of New Guinea
and the neighbouring islands. Its head is tawny brown, with a dark
streak down the neck ; the upper parts of the body spotted light and
dark brown ; under parts pale tawny ; beak black ; feet grey tinged
with reddish. It is very rare in confinement.
Eyton's Tree Duck (D. eytoni) peculiar to Australia, is perhaps
the prettiest of the genus. Its shape is more graceful; it has a longer
tail and smaller bill. Its head and neck are tawny ; the upper parts
of the body dark brown checked with pale tawny ; the rump and tail
deep brown ; the breast is light chestnut barred with black ; abdomen
tawny ; but its chief ornament consists of the feathers on its flanks,
which are very wide, long, and tapering, pale tawny yellow edged with
black. These feathers form as it were two fans, one on each side of
the bird. Its bill is pale pink spotted with black ; feet pink.
This pretty Tree Duck is unfortunately rare in our collections
and has not been bred in confinement. In its habits and shape it
somewhat recalls the Egyptian Goose and the Bernacles of mid-America.

home. They appear to be even more of a tree bird than the Californian
Quail, as they were not often seen on the ground except when feeding.
It was quite impossible to distinguish between my two birds, and
as they took very little notice of each other, I concluded that I had
two birds of the same sex. Occasionally I heard them calling, but could
not tell whether there was any difference in their notes, as there is in
the different sexes of the Californian bird. Their call is not nearly so
loud as that of the other tree Quails that I have kept, but I am afraid
that I am not able to describe it.
Until October there had not been the slightest sign of nesting or
love-making between them, and I was very much surprised on returning
from a week-end visit to a brother aviculturist to find that the Quails
were not occupying their usual roosting place in the trees. A search
resulted in my flushing one of them from a nest in a thick tuft of grass,,
but to my dismay I found the other dead close to the side of the nest.
The survivifig bird, which I believe to be the cock, continued to sit for
two or three days and then deserted, the weather being very bad at
the time. The eight creamy white eggs, slightly smaller than those of
the Californian Quail, were fertile, so but for a bit of bad luck I might
have been able to describe the nesting plumage of the first little birds of
this species to have been born in captivity.

Sir,-- In the December number of our Magazine Dr. Amsler says
that my Blue Robins nested outside. I am afraid this is a mistake, as
all my Robins have nested in nest-boxes and flower-pots, hung up inside
*the sheltered part of the aviary. All birds prefer nesting outside, but
I find, in uncertain weather, it gives the birds a better chance to rear
young when they have their nests under shelter. To encourage the birds
to nest inside I do not put up any nest-boxes outside. I am sure I would
not have been successful in rearing two fine, healthy young Robins
as early as the 4th April had the nests been outside.

A SMALL AVIARY IN CORNWALL
Sir, --It may interest some of the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine to read my experience in keeping a few foreign small birds
in this part of the country.
Mylor is situated on an estuary of the sea about 2 miles from
Falmouth and is fairly well sheltered by hills all round. The climate is
very mild and equable, so We do not get either excessive heat or cold ;
snow is seldom seen,; but slight frosts occur from time to time. My
aviary is unheated, and situated in the garden about 50 or 60 feet
above sea-level, and about a quarter of a mile from the sea. The aviary
consists of a shed well lit facing east and gets all the sunshine, and is
divided into three compartments, each measuring 4 by 6 by 7J feet,
with an outside flight of .14 by. 6 by 7 |feet. Early in September last
I took down a nest-box in the open flight thinking it deserted, when to
my great surprise out flew six wee Zebra Finches. My pair of Bichenos
immediately took on the duty of feeding all six, and very soon the

parents deserted them and went to nest again, the Bichenos still
" carrying on " until the young rascals were well able to fend for
themselves ! I removed them at dusk, when I lost one through
escaping into the next aviary, and I think was killed by the Spreos.
My Diamond Doves have reared two pairs. I lost my hen Long-tailed
Grassfinch with the young, through rats getting into their compartment
(which soon afterwards received the punishment they deserved !).
Now the male Long-tail has paired with my odd hen Zebra Finch, and
there are now (6th November) some dear wee lively mites ready to
fly at any moment. I am most anxious to see them. According to
Dr. Hopkinson's book, I am not sure whether the cross has actually
been bred and successfully reared. However, I hope mine will live
to good old age. The young Orange-cheeked Waxbills made a charming
nest in the long grass, but some good Cornish rains came down and
showed no mercy to the plucky little birds, who did their best to keep
the roof watertight, but when the rain came through into my bedroom
I could not wonder at it entering theirs ! The Diamond Finches have
been very disappointing, always quarrelling. The Cordons have tried
so hard, but always the young die--perhaps someone can help me.
My great trouble is I want more aviaries--always the same cry, is it not ?

NOTE ON THE HYBRID SWAN RECENTLY AT THE
ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985445333333333" page_id="56185733"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- As the hybrid between the Black and Mute Swans is little
known, a few notes on the specimen lately on view at the Zoological
Gardens may be worth publishing. Its bill was most like that of the
Mute Swan, and had a black " bean " at the tip as in that species ;
but the red colour extended from it over the bare lores, as in the Black
Swan, and there was no frontal knob, but merely a patch of minutely
feathered skin invading the beak where the knob should be. The red
of the beak was not nearly so bright as one would have expected, being
merely salmon-colour, whereas the Mute Swan's beak is bright orange-
red and the Black Swan's scarlet. I have seen a similar reduction of
colour by crossing in another rare hybrid waterfowl exhibited at the
Gardens some years ago. This was bred between the Orinoco Goose,
which has Vermillion legs, and the Egyptian Goose, whose legs are
bright pink ; yet this hybrid's legs were only dull brick-red. The iris
of the hybrid Swan was light brown ; in its curiously mottled plumage
I looked for some trace of reversion to an earlier type in black tips to the
flights, which occur in the young Black Swan and (only on the first
few feathers) in the young Black-necked Swan and in the Coscoroba. 1
The hybrid's flights, however, were completely white, as in both
parents. The inner secondaries were almost as smooth and flat as in
the Mute Swan, so that here and in the suppression of the knob there
was considerable reversion in the cancelling out of parental peculiarities,
the Black Swan's inner secondaries being very noticeably crimped.

Sir,- --Many who love birds must find it difficult at times to keep
them always caged, and Lady Grey's happy experiences with her Rock
Pepplars will, I hope, encourage some of our members to endeavour
to substitute for captivity--domestication.
The poorer Indian, who delights in the companionship of his Grey
Partridge, uses the little wicker cage not so much as a prison as a stable
1 What is the cygnet plumage of this species ? I have only seen a few with
some brown markings.

for his pet, and any evening in cantonments in Upper India you can
see a tall Sepoy striding along carrying in his hand a wicker cage, while
behind trots obediently his Titar, or tame Urey Partridge. Two which
I brought home with me and which are again in my possession, and to
which Dr. Amsler's recent article relates, are of this kind, and when, in
India, the hen commenced to lay and I placed her in a large aviary,
she wandered round disconsolate and refused to sit until I returned her
and her eggs to her little cage, when she at once gathered her eggs
beneath her and in due time hatched out her young. And after the
young were hatched the cock would lead his family out of the little
room opening on to the verandah, where the cage was kept, to the
tomato patch ; there he mounted guard while the hen brooded her
young, or they dusted themselves or fed or basked in the sun, until the
Havildar approaching with their cage, all would return to spend the
heat of the day in the shelter and coolness of the verandah. And I have
no doubt myself that their vigour and health were due to their liberty.
But it would take pages to describe all their adventures and pretty ways
till all the young safely reared, the parent birds embarked with me for
England. When stationed in Belgaum, in the Southern Maratha country,
an Indian brought me a young Crested Titmouse. He had endeavoured
to rear it on sattoo, or grain flour, and its days appeared numbered ; but
the asters in the garden were infested with a smooth green caterpillar,
and these, under my instructions, the Mali gathered and fed to the bird ;
and it throve and grew wonderfully tame. And when thereafter
1 went on circuit, the Titmouse in his wicker cage accompanied me
on my travels. Arrived at the Circuit Bungalow, my Havildar would
put the cage on the verandah floor, open the door, and out would fly
the Titmouse, to return after a few hours to his cage. So I came to
prefer one tame bird to a whole aviary.

A pair of these very beautiful Bush Shrikes, which are depicted
in the accompanying plate, have occupied a large cage in my bird
house since April, 1926 ; they are the sole survivors of the small
consignment of five or six examples which Messrs. Gamage's representa-
tive imported from South Africa in the summer of 1925 ; so that
they have been considerably over two years in confinement. As will
be seen from the plate, this Bush-Shrike is one of the most gorgeous
members of a very beautiful genus of brilliantly coloured birds. The
genus Laniarius, which is entirely confined to Africa, numbers nearly
twenty species, in which red or green is the principal colour in their
plumage ; they are all typical-looking Shrikes, the bill stout and
strongly hooked, with conspicuous stiff bristles at the base. The sexes
are generally identical, though in some females of atrococcineus the
crimson may not be quite so brilliant as in the males. One of my birds
measures 8*3 inches in length, of which the tail is 4 inches, so that they
are considerably larger than a Red-backed Shrike. They inhabit
South Africa, though they are not found near the Cape, but further
North in Griqualand and Natal are not uncommon, living in the

hottest parts of the region in open woods, and amongst dense thorn
thickets. It appears to extend north as far as the Zambesi region.
The late Charles Anderson, in his Birds of Damara Land, writes of
this species as follows :--
" This brilliantly coloured Shrike is pretty generally dispersed over
Damara and Great Namaqua Land, also over the Lake regions. It is
usually found either singly or in pairs, and is a wary bird, frequenting
both open woods and dense thickets, but preferring the latter. In
such localities it searches industriously for insects and their larvae,
and, whilst thus occupied, occasionally utters pleasant, clear, ringing
notes, but with the prelude of a harsh guttural sound. This species
builds its nest in the fork of a tree, constructing it roughly of the inner
bark of trees, with a few grasses interlaced, but without any softer
lining . . . The eggs are white, spotted with light brown, and some-
times tinged with green."
My birds, which I think are both cocks, occasionally utter, when
excited, a loud, clear, and very musical note, which always recalls
to me the Bush-Shrikes' notes I heard in East Africa, coming flute-
like from the dense thorn jungles, where one could never see the birds,
only hear their ringing calls. Unlike so many crimson or red plumaged
birds in captivity, mine have kept their brilliant colours, as though they
were wild moulted, in fact the only criticism I have to make on the
very excellent and life-like plate, which accompanies these notes,
is that the crimson is really not brilliant enough, but Mr. Boland Green
told me when he was here painting them, that he feared in reproduc-
tion it would be impossible to get the wonderful brilliance of colours the
living birds show. They are very tame, always coming up to the
bars of their cage to take a mealworm from my fingers, and like all
Shrikes are full of character. They have very fully developed the
characteristic habit of the genus of loving to impale a bee, or a piece
of a mouse, on one of the nails stuck in a piece of wood, which we
provide them with for that purpose ; I gave them a bough with long
thorns, but these soon became brittle and broke off, and a small piece
of wood hung up with protruding nails, answers the purpose equally
well. They are very carnivorous, and cannot do without mice or
young sparrows, and in the summer a good supply of larvae, grass-

hoppers, and beetles; they eat as well a lot of my usual insectivorous
mixture, and were overjoyed one day when I gave them a small lizard.
They do not care much for fruit. They feel the cold acutely, and the
higher the temperature, and the brighter the sun, the better they look ;
this is only what one would expect, when one knows that their natural
habitat is the desert bush in the dryest and hottest part of Africa ;
for this reason I have never dared put them into an aviary, for a possible
chance of their trying to breed ; our Norfolk climate is far too change-
able ; and I consider one of the reasons why I have kept them alive
bo long is that they have always had a perfectly even temperature;
besides, as I have said before, I believe they are two cocks, and so
there would be no point in running the risk.

THE BREEDING OF FISCHER&apos;S LOVEBIRD

By The Marquess of Tavistock
On obtaining six Fischer's Lovebirds (Agapornis jischeri) from an
early consignment I decided to gamble on the hardiness of the genus
Agapornis and, although summer was practically over, I turned them
straight into an unheated moveable outdoor aviary, 24 ft. by 8 ft. by
8 ft. Three nest logs were hung in the open flight with no overhead
protection at all in order that rain might fall on them and provide
moisture. jThe birds fell into moult soon after arrival, so no serious
nesting was begun until October was well advanced and the first
sharp frosts had come.
One hen contracted a slight chill and had to be taken into the
hospital. On her recovery I turned her into an aviary with a heated
shelter but she proceeded to murder two valuable finches, and I was
obliged to confine her in a cage. Among themselves, however,
Fischers seem to quarrel less than Masked Lovebirds.
All three logs were filled with elm twigs and bark, but in only
one were eggs laid. The building material seemed to be carried
in the beak, presumably by the hens, though I cannot discover any
reliable test of sex. After incubation had begun the weather grew
extremely bad. Soon after the young bird was hatched there
was a spell of bitter east wind, followed by torrential rains; then

the wind went back to the east, increasing in coldness and violence,
until on Boxing Day it culminated in a raging blizzard, of which, as
it faces east, the Lovebirds' aviary got the full benefit. The Fischers,
however, were in no way discomposed. They sat, squeaking cheerfully,
at the end of their log, while the snow whirled round them and covered
the roof of the flight with a thick white pall. In order, also, that their
offspring might not suffer from lack of fresh air they added to the
entrance hole two others of their own construction. Like their near
relatives, however, they did increase their bedding by carrying in fresh
supplies of bark and twigs. When the snow stopped the gale continued
for three days more and it never ceased to freeze day or night, then
at last there came a chilly and reluctant thaw. Such weather, one would
have thought, would certainly have terminated the existence of any
young bird less inured to cold than an Emperor Penguin, but on
11th January "Jeremy", as we afterwards called him, made his
appearance fully fledged, but unable to fly. He was an exact rep'ica
of his parents save that his frontal band was a trifle paler, and the
olivaceous tint extended further round the sides of the neck and down
to the green of the mantle. Judging that treatment that had proved
satisfactory with young Masked Lovebirds would do equally well for
him, we put him in a cage in the birdroom and supplied him with
brown breadcrumbs, cracked soaked hemp and shelled soaked sun-
flower. The same evening he was seen to be feeding and all seemed
to promise well. Next evening, however, he did not look so well and
his food appeared for the most part untouched and the following
morning it was only too evident that he was on hunger strike and
beginning to feel the effects. As the day was fairly mild I took him
back to his parents in the hope that they might feed him. But
although they seemed interested in him they gave him no nourishment.
He kept climbing the wire to the top of the aviary and then falling
down. No bird seems more easily hurt by a fall than a young Lovebird,
and after the third tumble the chances of the shaky and decrepit little
object I picked up surviving to be the first young Fischer to be reared
in confinement seemed to be more than a little remote. Clearly the
aviary was no place for Jeremy, so I brought him back to the house and
wondered whether I should be able to oblige him to swallow some

raw egg beaten up in milk--an unnatural but nutritious diet which
is the last hope for a baby parrot too young and too ill to feed himself.
Jeremy, however, required no forcible feeding, but himself drank the
liquid with unexpected gusto and fortified by it soon began to eat
soaked Indian millet which I provided as a substitute for the despised
hemp and bread crumbs. He improved rapidly and on the second
day began to eat soaked canary as well. He greatly preferred having
his meals on the carpets to eating them in his cage, and regarded
the latter -with extreme disfavour, although perfectly happy, as he
was allowed to run about the room.
For a time Jeremy appeared to be an only child, but five days later
to our surprise another young cock Lovebird w T as found on the grass.
He had, however, hurt himself by falling from the nest, and died the
same morning. Inspection of the log revealed two more little birds,
fully fledged, which from the small size of their heads appeared to be
hens. To save them from possible injury I decided to bring them
indoors. Jemima, as we called her, was a sturdy little thing, and soon
began to feed, selecting for her first meal the crushed hemp her brother
had so resolutely despised. Jessica, on the other hand, was the weakly
baby of the family, and required hand feeding on egg and milk for
some days before she began to eat seed, her first selection being millet.
Sad to relate, when about a month out of the nest, Jeremy, who had
grown into a fine strong bird, able to use his wings, had a bad attack
of apoplexy. Starvation, followed by careful dieting, restored him to
health for a time, but on the 17th he had another series of fits, which
this time ended fatally. His two sisters continue to thrive. Examina-
tion of the Lovebirds' nest log showed the reason of their habit of
adding material all the time it is occupied by the young. The lower
layers of bark were very wet; almost sopping, but the actual bed on
which the nestlings lay was of fresh material, clean, and dry. In this
way a supply of moisture is combined with lack of discomfort for the
occupants of the log.
When the young birds flew I removed the logs and drove the adults
into the aviary shelter for the night. Strange to say, this was not at all
a success, and two caught bad chills. On their recovery I returned the
logs, and the five have thriven as before.

Cecil W. B. Squire--The Malay Falconet
My adult Fischers are fed on canary, millet, hemp, oats, and sun-
flower, and they are very fond of oats softened by lying on the damp
earth. Their cries and general behaviour very closely resemble those
of the Nyasa Lovebird.
For some obscure reason Agapornis fischeri has been described as a
more sombre bird than its near ally. Not only, however, is it decidedly
larger and possessed of a bluish lower rump (quite as bright, if not
brighter, in the juvenile than in the adult), but the pinkish and red-gold
areas of the head and neck are richer in colour, more extensive and more
varied. In my opinion it is the handsomest member of the genus so
far imported, though less striking than A. personata.

<bodyText confidence="0.9909646" page_id="56185753"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
By Cecil W. B. Squire
Some time ago the arrival in England of this small bird was
announced in the Avicultural Magazine, and, as he is the first
Falconet of this type to be kept in captivity in this country, I thought
that it might interest some of your readers to hear in what manner
he is acclimatizing himself.
He arrived in a small oblong box, a wee fierce creature, looking like
a miniature of an eagle. His wings and back are shimmering black,
his breast a beautiful biscuit colour with here and there flecks of white.
He. has bright, black eyes and an exceptionally powerful beak. In
comparison with the beak, his claws are almost weak. He showed no
fear when his box was uncovered, and displayed a very definite tendency
to attack his admirers. We had arranged a long zinc and wire cage,
in a fairly warm room, as his future home. Unfortunately his will
to leave captivity led him to fly furiously against the wire meshes
of his cage, and his tail feathers were damaged. This was the first
difficulty demanding solution. Later in the evening we went to see
how things were with him, and, to our dismay, found that the Satan
of Birds, made classical by Lord Tavistock under the cognomen of
Mr. " X ", had already begun his assault. The Falconet was sitting,

quiet and shivering, at the bottom of his cage. Lord Tavistock,
suspecting the temperature of the room, carried him to the bird hospital,
where there is a constant temperature of 85 degrees F. Here he began
to regain all his vivacity. Mr. " X " appears to have little power in
a temperature.
Next we had to consider the question of his feeding. We tried
him with mealworms. Hungry as he obviously was, he refused to
touch them. On that first day, and on that day only, he ate a grass-
hopper. He sidled along his perch and snatched the wretched creature
o,ut of our fingers and ate it very discriminatingly. Being tried with the
same food later again he took it from our fingers, and with a most
contemptuous gesture, flung it upon the floor. Nowadays his meal
consists of the bodies of small birds or mice, for which he shows great
fondness. On the approach of the bearer of his meals he was wont
to fly furiously about his cage, and would never attempt to eat until he
was alone. Gradually, however, by a process of putting in one's
hand, in which was the mouse or bird, one taught him to fly from his
perch on to one's hand and to eat his meal out of it. He is, really,
fascinating to watch, standing upon his prey, both claws firmly holding
it, and eating with a quick jerky movement. He will now even fly
down, pick the prey out of one's hand and carry it to the perch at the
other end of his cage in a single movement.
He and I came into conflict the other day. We had found that
a paper-covered tray seemed to induce a sort of indolence, which took
the form of a refusal to use a perch or his legs. He would sit all ruffled
up, by the electric heater behind his cage, on his tail. To counteract
this Lord Tavistock suggested that we should cut turves and put them
at the bottom of his cage. This he approved. He would sit sometimes
on a hillock, or on his perch. On the day in question I had gone to feed
him. He, apparently, liking his game high, had hidden his yesterday's
mouse under a turf. When he saw me lift up the repulsive remains
he flew on to my hand and seized his beloved corpse firmly in his left
claw, gripping my finger with his right. He then attacked me to some
tune, with his beak. I finally made him let go his hold of the remains
and of my finger, but he sulked like a small child, and refused to eat
his fresh meat.

We found that, although he had lost all fear with us, he still flew
against the bars of his cage when strangers came in. Now he has
a very long wickerwork cage with wooden bars, and up to the present
the difficulty appears to have been solved. As he is subject to colds
and loathes, with some reason, the English weather, he is not permitted
to take many baths, and when he does have one, it is warmed.
He is about five inches long from the top of his head to the end of
his tail.
I have been reading the description of Microhierax fringillarius
in Herbert C. Robinson's Birds of the Malay Peninsula and think
that my bird must be a hen.

By J. Delacour
Sheldrakes (Tadorna and Casarca) are very closely related to
the Egyptian and Orinoco Geese, only differing from these in having
shorter legs; they all interbreed readily, and require a large enclosure
with grass and plenty of water.
The Common Sheldrake ( Tadorna tadorna) inhabits Central Asia
and Europe, and migrates for the winter to North Africa, India, and
China. It prefers the sea shore to fresh water and feeds chiefly on
small molluscs and crustaceans. It is a handsome bird, slightly
larger than a Wild Duck, its head and upper neck, a band across the
shoulders, the tips of the wings and tail are all black; it has a green
and red brown speculum, a black stripe across the abdomen and a wide
chestnut band round its back and chest; the remainder of its plumage
is pure white. Its bill is red, adorned with a caruncle which is swollen
at its base. Its feet are pink. The duck is smaller and minus the
caruncle.
The sexes are alike in summer, but the colouring of the female
is less brilliant; the drake loses his caruncle, and the duck's face turns
light grey after the summer moult.
Sheldrakes nest in holes. In captivity they should be provided
with large wooden boxes buried in the ground. They breed freely

and lay a large egg for their size. They occasionally bully weaker
companions without, however, becoming really dangerous to them.
The drake whistles softly, but the duck utters a raucous cackle. If
the Sheldrake is not pinioned it soon vanishes.
The Rajah Sheldrake (T. radjah) from the Moluccas, New Guinea
and Northern Australia, has the head, neck, a band across the back
and the wing coverts white ; the mantle and a band across the chest
rusty chestnut; speculum russet and green with a white border, bill
and feet rosy. No caruncle. It is a rare and attractive species, but
rather delicate.
The species belonging to the genus Casarca are larger and have
black beaks and feet. Russet and grey are their prevailing colours.
Both male and female have very loud and disagreeable voices and are
much too fond of making them heard. They are very combative and
each pair must be kept separately. The females are the worst and egg
the males on to fight. They are very hardy birds.
The Ruddy Sheldrake (Casarca casarca) is found throughout
Central Asia, Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the South of Spain,
migrating in winter as far as India and Egypt. Its head is yellowish
white, the whole body bright and shining russet, wings white with green
speculum, flights and tail black. The male bird is recognized by his
narrow black collar which divides the neck and breast. This species
breeds very readily in confinement.
The Cape Sheldrake (C. cana ) peculiar to the Cape of Good Hope
is distinguished by the male bird having a grey-blue head and the female
a white face and throat. It is very rare in confinement and has so
far only been bred as a hybrid with the preceding species.
The Paradise Sheldrake (C. variegata ) from New Zealand
presents a great difference of plumage between the sexes. The male
has a black head, neck, wing and tail tips. The wing coverts are white ;
speculum green and russet; the rest of its plumage is grey pencilled
with black. The female has a white head and neck and russet body
pencilled with black ; her wings and tail are like her mate's. This
species, although perfectly hardy and extremely prolific in confinement,
is very scarce at present; this is much to be regretted, as its numbers
are also decreasing very much in its native land.

The Australian Sheldrake (C. tadornoides) is found to the South

which crosses the upper back and the breast. The female may be
known by her white spotted face. This handsome species does wel]

This group comprises those typical Ducks which generally speaking
approach Wild Ducks.
The Wild Duck or Mallard (A. boschas) is too well known to
need description here, but though so common is a very beautiful bird,
as ornamental on a piece of water as any rarer species. For all that it
must be eliminated from a collection containing nearly related species
as it crosses so freely. Pdre-bred specimens are particularly elegant and
well shaped, but many of those which live in confinement or enjoy
semi-liberty show traces of domestic ancestry and are heavy and
clumsy.
The Mallard is the ancestor of all domesticated breeds, of which
some, notably the miniature white or grey Ducks, are exceedingly
ornamental, but should never be associated with wild species.
Certain species very strongly remind one of Mallards, but the drakes
are like the ducks and have no bright colours. Some of these have
become very rare. They are of little interest from the ornamental
point of view, so we will only give them brief mention here
The Hawaian Duck (A. wyvilliana), theLAYSAN (A. laysanensis ),
the Oustalet (A. oustaleti) from the Marianne Islands, the Dusky
Duck (A. rubrijpes) from N. America, which is difficult to breed in
confinement, and its neighbours from Mexico (A. diazi) and Florida
(A. fulvigula).
The Spot-billed Duck (A. jpcecilorhyncha) also strongly resembles
the Mallard. It is a non-migratory Indian species. The sexes are
alike and there is no " eclipse ", which is also the case with the following

nine species. It is a rather large bird, grey and bright tawny, thickly
spotted with blackish brown, the back and wings are darker and the
latter have a green speculum surrounded with white, and white primaries;
its bill is black with an orange yellow spot at the end and another
at the base of the mandibles ; its feet are orange. It is hardy and
prolific in confinement. Some have found it quarrelsome, but my
specimens are peaceable and do not interbreed with other species.
A nearly related species (A. zonorhynchus) is found in China and
Japan. It is distinguished by duller plumage, by its tertiary flights
being grey edged with white, and by the absence of the yellow spot
at the base of the mandibles. It is never imported.
The Philippine Duck ( A . luzonica) is greyish brown with head,
neck and breast tawny rust colour ; a dark blackish brown line on the
occiput and two others across the eyes, the speculum is green shot
purple ; grey blue bill, grey brown feet. It has not yet been imported
to our knowledge.
The Australian Wild Duck (A. superciliosa) is dark brown with
the throat and two lines above and below the eye pale fawn, green
speculum bordered black. It is hardy in confinement and breeds
freely.
The Yellow-billed Duck (A. undulata) inhabits Africa, South
of the Equator. It is more elegantly shaped than the preceding,
its plumage pale fawn with dark brown spots. Darker above where
the feathers have pale borders, the speculum green shot purple
surrounded with white ; bright yellow bill with a black spot in the
middle, orange feet. It is a pretty and hardy species which breeds
freely.
The Abyssinian Duck (A. u. ruepelli) is a variety of the yellow-
billed, rather smaller, much deeper chestnut brown, edged with black,
and the bill more intensely yellow. I received a pair in 1923 and had
young from them in 1925.
All these species which we have enumerated have exactly the habits
and voice of the Wild Duck. Those still to come are less like it.
The Spotted Duck (A. sparsa) is found in South and East Africa.
The sexes are alike, blackish brown, sparsely streaked, the wings
and tail are strewn with large light spots which sometimes may be

almost white ; the large green blue speculum is surrounded with
white, the bill grey and yellow, the feet orange. They live, in pairs
by the banks of hidden streams. In confinement, where though they
breed freely they are not common, only single pairs can be kept, as
they are very spiteful, the duck especially so, and attack all other ducks.
Their cry is lower and harsher than the foregoing.
Meller's Duck (A. melleri) from Madagascar, is rather light
chestnut brown with dark brown spots, head grey with black stripes,
green speculum, black bill, * orange feet. It has very rarely been
imported, but fertile hybrids have been obtained between it and the
Wild Duck.
The Bronze-winged Duck (A. specularis) from Chili has but rarely
been brought to Europe, which is a great pity, as it is a very fine species.
It has a dark brown head with large white spots on the face, throat
and sides of the neck, its body tawny brown with dark brown spots,
the wings are green with purple speculum, bill black and feet yellow.
The Crested Duck (A. cristata) ranges from Peru and the Argentine
to Tierra del Fuego. Another handsome species, which is all too rarely
obtainable here. It is light fawn with brown spots, the wings are
greenish and the speculum purple, the very pointed tail is black, the
head decked with a kind of mane, bill and feet are black.
The Gad wall (A. strepera ) inhabits the Northern Hemisphere,
but does not go very far north. When the Drake is in full colour
his head and neck are tawny grey speckled with brown; his body is
vermiculated grey and white, as are also the pointed feathers on his
back, and edged with tawny ; the lower back and tail coverts are black,
wings reddish brown and black with a white speculum, bill grey and
yellow and the feet are yellow. The duck and the drake in eclipse
plumage resemble the Mallard except for the white speculum on the
wings. It has a curious short harsh cry.
The Gadwall breeds freely in confinement, but is not a very orna-
mental species.
There is a smaller closely related species confined to the Fanning
Islands which is extremely rare.
The Falcated Duck (A. falcata) is one of the handsomest of
this genus. It breeds in east Siberia and winters in China and Japan.

The drake in colour has a crest at the back of his head and his tertiary
flight feathers are very long, slender, and curved in hoops over his
back. The colouring is silvery grey, vermiculated with black; tail,
speculum, and hoops are bronzed green edged with light grey ; head,
neck, and crest are green shot with purple, with a little spot on the
forehead; the chin, throat, and a patch below the neck are pure
white. The drake in eclipse and the duck are chestnut brown with
black spots. The bill and feet are grey. They thrive and breed in
Europe.
The Wigeon have short high beaks, and are more herbivorous than
the foregoing.
The Common Wigeon (A. penelope) is very common in Europe
and Asia, ranging from far north down to India, Egypt, and Senegal.
It is also found in a restricted locality on the east side of the United
States. The drake is very elegant, with bright, ruddy head and a wide
fawn coloured stripe on the crown ; breast vinous red and white
abdomen ; the back and sides are grey, streaked with black; wings
and tail mingled black, white, grey, and bronzy green, bill and feet
grey. The duck and the drake in summer are brown with blackish
spots. She has grey wing coverts in summer, but the drakes are always
white, which provides an easy means of distinguishing the sexes.
The Common Wigeon is hardy and prolific, it is active and noted
for the musical and pleasing whistling of the drake.
The American Wigeon (A. americana) winters in the United
States, and breeds in North-west America. It-is distinguished from
the above by its vinous back and flanks, its head is pale grey with
black spots, with a white stripe on the crown, and two bronzy green
stripes from the eye to the nape. The duck and the drake in eclipse
have greyer heads and backs than the Common Wigeon, and can
easily be distinguished by them.
This species will live and breed in confinement as freely as the
Common Wigeon, and it has the same call.
The Chiloe Wigeon (A. sibilatrix) is found from South America
to the south of Uruguay and Peru. Its head is white in front, blackish
at the back, with a wide green stripe from the eye to the nape of the
neck ; its breast dappled black and white, the mantle composed of

pointed feathers which are dark grey, edged with white ; its wings
and tail are white and black, ruddy flanks, white abdomen, feet and
bill grey. The duck is only distinguishable from the drake by her
smaller size, slightly duller colouring, and the rump grey instead of
white. The drake does not go into eclipse.
The Chiloe Wigeon's call is slightly different to that of its allies ;
it is hardy and prolific, and thanks to its amusing habits and pretty
plumage all the year round in both sexes, may be considered one of
our most ornamental waterfowl.
The Pintails are known by their long bills and necks, and their
pointed tails.
The Common Pintail (A. acuta) is one of our finest ducks. It is
found throughout the northern hemisphere. The drake has a beautiful
silky brown head and neck, a white line up the sides of the neck, the
breast and abdomen white, the back and flanks vermiculated grey
and black ; the feathers of the mantle are pointed, bluish black,
bordered with white; grey wings with reddish brown speculum, the flanks
yellowish, the tail grey and black, and having two enormously long
feathers. The duck and the drake in eclipse are fawn with brown spots.
The Pintail drake utters a little tuneful whistle. They do well in
confinement.
The Chilian Pintail (A. spinicanda) is very common to the south
of the mouth of the Amazon. It is like the preceding, but is smaller.
Both drake and duck are light fawn, finely flecked with brown ; yellow
bills turning to blue grey at the point, and barred with black above
it; the feet are grey. It is a very prolific breeder in confinement.
The Kerguelan Pintail (A. eytoni) is browner, and has a dark
grey bill. Its importation to Europe is much to be desired.
The Bahama Duck (A. bahamensis) is shaped like the Pintails,
but its tail is shorter ; it is to be found in the Isle of Bahama, in the
east of South America, in Bolivia, and Peru. Its colour is a pretty
reddish fawn, with a green speculum ; its chin, throat, and cheeks
are white ; its beak is grey with large carmine spots at the sides near
the base ; feet grey. The sexes are alike. This is a very pretty little
duck, and does well in Europe. The drake's call is shrill and harsh.
The Galapagan Duck (A. galapagensis) is only distinguishable

The Red-billed Duck (A. erythrorhyncha), which is found in
south and south-east Africa, as well as in Madagascar, recalls the
Bahaman Duck, but is greyer and darker above and paler under-
neath, with a fawn coloured speculum ; its bill is rosy red spotted with
black. It is rare in confinement, but breeds freely.

By Karl Plath, Chicago, Ill., U.S.A.
As Trogons are such unusual birds in confinement a few words
regarding mine may not be uninteresting. I have two Cuban Trogons
(Prionotelus temnurus) which are doing quite well in a mixed aviary
containing the usual aviary birds as well as the more uncommon ones,
such as Callistes, Tanagers, Sugar-birds. Superb Spreo, Nyasa Love-
birds, etc. Trogons are renowned for their resplendent plumage, hence
I was somewhat disappointed when mine arrived with defective wings
and tails and a generally frowsy appearance. At that time, too, they
seemed stupid or indifferent and frequently too slow to take their share
in the daily rations of mealworms and insects. However, they were
tame enough to take food from my fingers, and it was not long before
they commenced to grow their really beautiful plumage and are
now in much better condition and appearance than they were, though
I think with time they will become even more attractive.
In one of the back numbers of the Magazine (August, 1925) one is
represented in a coloured plate ; this gives a good idea of the appear-
ance of the underside with its areas of pure white, delicate grey, rose-
pink, etc., but the upper parts show a rich mixture of metallic hues
which on the back appears similar to green gilt. The head is shining
blue, and the wings and tail black and white, the central feathers of
the latter being green, blue, and copper. The bill is red and black on
the upper ridge. They frequently sail to the ground, where they are
becoming more adept at seizing an insect or other food, and often fly
to a branch on which grapes or elderberries are hung, and snatching

one, fly to another branch to eat it. One of them is not quite so alert
as the other, and sometimes before it has time to swallow the worm a
Tanager or Spreo will pull it away. The appearance when animatedly
perching is decidedly awkward, and their short legs look as though
they were merely " stuck " on, as in a poorly mounted bird.
The call is a guttural croak, which in one of the birds is a higher
pitch, and sometimes when I hold them, they emit a shrill cry, almost
human in sound. As in these Trogons the plumage of the sexes is
identical, I am wondering if this is a distinction--at any rate, they
frequently call to one another. In action they remind me of our
American Cuckoos, bowing the head and puffing out the throat with
its whisker-like feathers. At night they roost together, but during
the day rarely use the same perch.
They have been called uninteresting in captivity, but they are
always in motion, and while lacking the grace of most birds, their odd
appearance is an attractive addition to my aviary.
As to food, they eat from the same dish as the other birds, taking
it in great mouthfuls, and certainly bolt their food--I have also seen
them tear great pieces from a lettuce leaf and cram it into their
strong beaks.
The month of September was the record for extremes in temperature ;
one week the high temperature of 95 degrees was reached, and within
eight days it fell to 47 degrees. This did not seem to bother the Trogons,
however, which apparently are able to stand a cool climate, as we
have had much of it since.

There are surely few birds that can compare with the Egrets where
grace is concerned. They have always seemed to me to be the fairies
of the avian world. The beautiful curves, the wonderful filmy nuptial
plumage and the spotless dress, as white as driven snow, give the birds
a very ethereal appearance. In captivity these birds require great
attention if one wishes to keep them in perfect condition, both in

respect to their food and surrounding; cleanliness is of the first import-
ance, or their plumage very soon gets soiled. It is necessary that their
aviary should be well sanded or gravelled, and that there is a constant
supply of fresh clean water. For food they should have, if possible,
a supply of small live fish, frogs, etc. ; if this cannot be constant, cut-up
fish and chopped meat will do, though I think that live food is very
essential; birds fed wholly on raw meat never look in good condition,
and give one a very erroneous idea of what Egrets are really like in a
state of freedom. The amount of live fish that these birds can consume
is incredible.
It is always best to keep Egrets in an aviary alone unless this
be a very large one, for I have found them to be great bullies, not so
much in the daytime as at night, for some species seem to be semi-
nocturnal, and they have a habit of going around and turning the
*others birds out of their roosting places, at least that has been my
\0x25A0experience.
I am only familiar with the Snowy Egret in captivity, which is perhaps
the most beautiful of them all. This bird has the filmy decomposed
feathers on the head, breast, and back. I found it to be a charming pet,
*lively and confiding in its demeanour, and very different from the
ordinary Herons, which in captivity are usually very stolid and unattrac-
tive. This species has a peculiar habit of standing in shallow water,
and putting one foot under a bunch of water weeds and making a
trembling motion with it; this is no doubt done to drive out any small
aquatic insects.
I am familiar with most of the European species in a state
of freedom, and have spent a considerable time in studying their
habits. All of them are found in the vicinity of water, usually in marshy
places where the vegetation is rank. I have never seen any of them
fish in the same manner as Herons ; they seek their food by the edge
of the water or in the marshes or swamps, feeding mainly upon insects,
though they will eat almost any living thing which they come across
if it is not too large to be swallowed. The Buff-backed Egret, though,
will frequent pasture lands, and wait attendance upon the herds of
cattle, feeding upon the insects which the cattle disturb out of the
grass, which are mainly grasshoppers and locusts ; the birds are remark-

ably intimate with the huge beasts, walking in and out of their legs
as they walk, or perching upon their backs ; sometimes when the birds
have finished feeding they will all alight upon the backs of the cattle
and rest, thus presenting one of the most unique sights in the annals
of natural history. It is said that the birds feed upon the ticks which
adhere to the animals, but I do not think that they do so, for the
insects usually fasten themselves upon the buttocks or the neck of the
beast, in which places the bird cannot reach them. But in cattle-
breeding lands these birds are looked on with great favour as tick
destroyers, and are never shot or molested in any way, so that it is
well not to disillusion their protectors.
I have noticed a rather remarkable thing in regard to the bird
in question: they seem to know the spot where the cattle will graze,
or on the other hand the cattle may go to the Egrets, but invariably
the birds will congregate on a spot before the cattle are in sight, and it
is almost certain that the cattle will make that place their feeding
ground. I have watched very closely, but I have never seen the Egret
pick any ticks off the cattle, though I believe they wait until the insects
are fully gorged and fall off on their own accord.
The Great White Egret is a very shy bird, and this is no doubt
due to the persecution that it has undergone, but sometimes, through
careful stalking, I have been able to observe it at comparatively close
quarters. It seems to suffer from nerves, for the slightest unusual noise
will cause it to jump, and the sight of a human being will send it miles
away. It seldom gets into a position in which it cannot see the surround-
ing country, and its long neck, which seems almost too long for the
bird, is always stretched above the reeds, the bright yellow eyes con-
tinually on the look-out for danger. Standing, walking, or flying, the
Great White Egret is always the acme of grace, but in captivity, unless
given great care, its beautiful white plumage soon gets soiled and the
bird seems to get very dejected.
I see no reason why, given suitable conditions, Egrets should not
breed in captivity, I have never heard of their being bred in Europe.
In spite of the protection afforded this bird in Africa, great numbers
are still slaughtered for their feathers, and in the Sudan I have seen
large bundles of about 100 feathers each offered for 12s. 6 d. by the Arabs.

and Indians at the small trading stores. I suppose these would be
brought down from the banks of the Nile.
One of my happiest memories is of the hours I spent by a roosting
place of a large colony of Egrets. The hundreds of these exquisite
snowy creatures, contrasting wonderfully with the dark green
foliage of the trees and mirrored in the deep dark waters below, as the
sun sank down in the west, the white plumage of the birds took on a
ruddy hue in the last rays of the setting sun, and changed in the
course of a few minutes to ghostly green in that mysterious afterglow
which precedes the sunset in the tropics, the mingled perfume of the
mimosa and the lotus, the soft evening breeze, the lapping of the
waters on the bank, the only sound breaking the stillness of the evening ;
leave a picture in my mind which will never be effaced by the passing
of time.
During the rainy reason when heavy rains fall at night or when there
has been a very heavy dew, the Egrets settle on the flat-topped mimosa
trees surrounding their roosting place, and for about two hours after
sun-up perform a very lengthy toilet before they eventually fly away
in small parties to their respective feeding grounds. It is a wonderful
sight to see thousands of these birds glistening in the early morning
sunshine on the tops of the trees ; in the distance it looks as though
there had been a fall of snow over night.
In the evenings the birds arrive in tens and twelves, flying abreast
between the trees bordering the water, swinging round the sharp curves
of the river with delightful grace and ease ; the first-comers arrive
about an hour before sunset, and the last stragglers just about dusk.
A great deal of squabbling and bickering takes place before the birds
eventually settle down for the night, but as soon as every bird is settled,
there is absolute silence.
It is when having an argument with his neighbour that the Egret
looks his best, his filmy plumes are all erected, the long scapular
feathers are raised almost at right angles to the back and fall in a filmy
cascade, the wings are half open, the head is drawn back between the
shoulders and the dagger-like bill thrust out at intervals.
The pretty little Squacco Heron, which appears to be superficially
an Egret, is usually found either in pairs or solitary in the reed beds

The Grand National Show at the Crystal Palace on the 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th February was a great success. The foreign bird section was
quite up to the average, and contained a most interesting collection
of birds. The thirty-two classes were on the whole well supported,
and contained 210 entries. Mr. H. Whitley once more sent some of
the gems of his collection, the best part of seventy exhibits, in charge
of his curator--Miss Gladys Salter, and was rewarded by winning
the " National Foreign Bird Trophy," presented by Mr. G. B. Chapman ;
the " Grand National " silver medal; both " National Challenge "
medals, and all three " Championship " diplomas.
The class for Lories and Lorikeets contained a very fine Black-
winged Lory (first) and a nice pair of the rare Versicolor Lorikeets
(second), both exhibits owned by Mr. Whitley, while Mr. Frostick was
third and fourth with his superb pairs of Yellow-backed Lories and
Swainson's Lorikeets. Amongst the Lovebirds and Parrotlets was a
very steady pair of Masked Lovebirds (first) exhibited by Mr. Frostick ;
second prize was awarded to a perfect pair of Nyasas, belonging to
Mr. Haworth, and Mr. F. Child took third with a good pair of Fischers.
Mr. Whitley sent a nice pair of Peach-faced, now somewhat scarce,
and a smart pair of unidentified Psillacula, not unlike cyanojpygia, but
smaller and of a more yellowish-green.
Mr. Whitley won the class for Brotogerys , etc., with a good pair of
Orange-flanks, and he was also successful in the class for Common
Rosel] as and Common Ring-necks, with a very fine Blossom-headed
Parrakeet. The class for Conures (excepting Whitley's and Golden^

was carried off by Mr. Whitley's Patagonian, a somewhat scarce bird
that also won last year. An excellent pair of Prince Lucians gained
second prize for Mr. F. Child ; third being awarded to Mr. Frostick's
Green Conure.
Another Primley success was registered in the class for Kings,
Crimson-wings, Pennants, etc., Mr. Whitley's fine pair of Kings

winning for the third year in succession. Mr. B. Jackson's equally
good Crimson-wings were second, and Mr. Frostick's Barnard--a very
good female--third.
The " All other species of Parrakeets " class contained only four
entries, but all worthy of first prizes. Lord Tavistock was first and
third with one of his very rare Queen of Bavaria Conures, in perfect
condition, and a good example of the Derbyan Parrakeet. Mr. Whitley
occupied the other two " places " with a very fine Eed-shining Parrakeet
and a little Blue-rumped Parrot, probably the only one in the country.
Grey, Timneh, Senegal, and Common Amazons again found
Mr. Whitley to the fore with Green-cheeked and Festive Amazons,
and a nice little Timneh Parrot. Mr. Whitley was also first, second,
and third in the class for White and Rose-breasted Cockatoos, with a
perfect White-crested, leading a Triton and a Rose-crested, all three
with a beautiful bloom. There were three Black Cockatoos in the
class for " All other species of Cockatoos and Macaws ", Mr. Whitley
being first, second, and fourth with a Great Black, a Banksian, and a
Spix Macaw respectively; Lord Tavistock's Western Black Cockatoo
being second.
The " All other species of Parrot " class provided the rarest bird
in the show, namely Mr. Whitley's Pesquet's Parrot, 1 a magnificent
bird, quite tame; the same exhibitor's Baudin's and Diademed
Amazons were third and fourth; Lord Tavistock's almost unique
Guilding's Amazon was second. The " Hybrid and Abnormally-coloured
bird " class was as usual of great interest, and was won by Lord Tavi-
stock's remarkable Lutino Blue-fronted Amazon, his hybrid Princess
of Wales X Crimson-winged Parrakeet being second. Mr. Whitley
showed his Rosy-faced X Masked Lovebird hybrid, very similar to,

but larger than, the Black-cheeked Nyasa cross, shows little trace of

a rather disappointing result, and a Pagoda X Malabar Mynah, Our
Editor judged the above classes, so there was little cause for complaint;
in addition, he was called upon for a speech at the Judges 5 luncheon,
an ordeal which he successfully came through with great applause.
Space will not permit of anything like a full report of the many
classes that fell to the lot of our genial member--Allen Silver. In the
-class for Quails, Partridges, Pigeons, etc.., Mr. Whitley was first with
a good Crowned Pigeon (G.coronata), which was awarded the " National
Eoreign Bird Trophy ", his Black-headed Partridge was second, and a
pretty little unidentified Fruit Pigeon third. The next three classes
for various Common Finches were won by St. Helena Waxbills
(Mrs. Victor Cooper's) Cordon Bleus (Mr. F. Hawksby's), and White
Java Sparrows (Mr. Whitley's). The first in the Common Grass-finch
class was taken by Mr. Whitley with a pair of Chestnut-breasted
Finches, third and fourth prizes going to his Heck's Long-tailed
Grass-finches, until recently very scarce, and his Pectoral Finches ;
second prize was awarded to Mrs. Victor Cooper for a specially good
pair of Diamond Finches. The class for the rarer Grass-finches and
rarer Waxbills was deservedly won by Mr. J. Cranna's Dufresne's
Waxbills in wonderful condition; Mrs. Victor Cooper took second
and third with Violet-eared Waxbills, excellent male bird, but inferior
female, and a good Parson Finch. Mr. Frostick won the class for
Buntings, Siskins, Pileated Finches, etc., with an excellent Rainbow
Bunting, a species very difficult to keep in anything like show form in
a cage ; Mr. Whitley and Mr. Beauchamp were second and third with
Red-crested Finches.
All species of Cardinals, Hawfinches. First three places : Mr. Whitley
with a Black-cheeked Cardinal, Blue Grosbeak, and Rose Cardinal,
all excellent birds. As usual, the class for Weavers and Whydahs was
a failure and contained but two birds--a Mahali and a Chestnut-backed
Weaver--both Mr. Whitley's. Mr. P. W. Beauchamp gained the
premier position in the class for the common Tanagers, with a good
Scarlet; Miss Hughes was second with a Tri-colour, and Mr. Whitley
third and fourth with Summer and Black. Amongst the rare Tanagers

and Sugar Birds, Mr. C. S. Dunstan was first with a good Yellow
Tanager, and Mr. Whitley second with a Yellow-winged Sugar Bird.
As usual, Mr. Frostick met with success in the class for Shamahs,
gaining first and second prizes with a perfect male bird in full song
and an equally fine female ; third prize went to a good Mexican Clarino-
(Mr. Frostick's). There were eleven entries of Glossy Starlings, six,,
however, " not for competition Mr. J. Spedan Lewis sent a good
series, comprised of Crowned, White-capped, Burchell's, Green, Lilac,,
and Royal. Mr. Whitley was first with a splendid Royal, winner of a
44 Challenge " medal, while his White-capped was third ; second prize
was gained by Mr. C. S. Dunstan's Purple-headed. The class for Robins
was made up of six entries, all Pekins. Mr. H. J. Indge's bird was by
far the best, a splendid colour-fed example. Mr. Whitley's Temminck's.
Whistling Thrush gained yet another success for Primley in the class&gt;
for Thrushes and Fruit-suckers ; Mr. Frostick being awarded second
for an Orange-headed Ground Thrush, and Mr. Beauchamp third for
a Golden-fronted Fruit-sucker.
There was little of interest in the 44 All species of Hangnests and
Cassiques class " ; first prize was gained by Mrs. Victor Cooper, with
a Hangnest; second and third prizes were awarded to Mr. Whitley
for a good Black Cassique and Mr. Frost for a Bare-eyed Troupial.
Mr. Whitley's birds were in winning form, and it was only natural
that he should win the next class, for Pies, Jays, Barbets, and Toucans,
his Hunting Cissa being first, and his Indian Crow third ; Mr. Frostick's
veteran Red-billed Toucan filling the gap.
The most disappointing class in the section was that for Birds of
Paradise, Motmots, Sunbirds, and kindred species. Out of all the-
Birds of Paradise in the country, only one was sent to the 44 Palace ",
an immature Twelve-wired, which gained first prize for Mr. Whitley;
second prize went to his splendid Motmot, which might well have-
headed the class. The four other exhibits were all Sunbirds, the best
being Mrs. V. Cooper's Double-collared; Lord Tavistock's Purple
and Mr. Yealland's Golden-breasted and Double-collared were all
rather rough. The two remaining classes were for 44 All other species
of insectivorous and fruit-eating birds, 4 smaller than ' and 4 larger
than ' a Silver-eared Mesia ". An exceptionally good Rufous-bellied

BIRDS AT THE NEST 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999026095238095" page_id="56185773"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
Mr. Douglas Dewar, well-known to most of us as a writer on Indian
birds, has producd an instructive work on the behaviour of birds during
the nesting season, which will be read with great interest by those
who aspire to the breeding of birds in captivity, for in it he throws light
on the often apparently strange behaviour of birds during this season.
The reason, for instance, of birds sometimes neglecting their young
before these are able to care for themselves, or even killing those
which but a short time before they were labouring so hard to rear.
At first sight one is surprised that the subject would yield sufficient
to fill a book of 267 pages, but it is larger than it would at
first appear to be. One is apt to judge the behaviour of birds from
the human standpoint and to forget that the lower animals are governed
by a compelling instinct rather than by reason, and Mr. Dewar has set
himself the task of showing that this is so and thus dispelling many of
the misconceptions that prevail on the subject. Instinct to reproduce
its species compels the Swallow to build its nest and to rear brood after
brood of young during its few months' stay in its northern home. But
often before the last brood has left the nest the instinct to migrate
becomes stronger than that which has previously driven it to feed its
hungry brood and it is compelled to depart South leaving its young
to starve.

The instinct of nest-building is perhaps the most wonderful, for
birds taken from the nest before they are fledged and han d-reared will,
the following spring, build nests typical of the species, though they can
certainly not recollect what the nest they were hatched in was like.
These and other matters connected with the nesting habits of birds
are ably dealt with by Mr. Dewar, who takes 'his facts not only from
wild birds, but from those in captivity as recorded in the pages of the
Avicultural Magazine.
THE HEART OF A BIRD 1
Mr. Anthony Collett is one of those rare observers of bird life who
reasons out the why and the wherefore of the habits of the feathered
world, and in this book discusses his theories on such subjects as
protective coloration, hereditary instinct and migration. He gives us
a chapter for each month of the year, in each of which he shows himself
to be a very careful observer and a charming writer. The book contains
some beautiful photographic illustrations by Mr. Oliver Gr. Pike.

Sir, --Through the kindness of a friend, I have been fortunate in
obtaining two very beautiful abinistic Roseate Cockatoos. All the grey
of the normal plumage is replaced by snow white, the head, breast,
beak, and soft parts remaining unchanged.
The birds are adult, and a true pair, and I have every hope of
inducing them to breed, though the young of the first generation will
not improbably revert to the ordinary colour.

MASKED LOVEBIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.996099071428571" page_id="56185775"  page_num="78" year="" vol="">
Sir, --It may be of interest to record that the second brood of Masked
Lovebirds, mentioned in my recent article, were successfully reared.
Directly they left the nest, I put them in a cage in the birdroom, and
fed them on brown breadcrumbs, cracked soaked hemp, and shelled
soaked sunflower, which they picked up for themselves as soon as they
became really hungry. There were three, and, as in the case of the
first brood, the two which, by their more massive heads appeared to
be cocks, had perpendicular streaks of black near the base of the upper
mandible, while the beak of possible female was entirely red. Both
pairs--I think, after all, I have two true pairs--are nesting again, and,
although in an unheated aviary, have taken no harm from the recent
intense cold and wet. Five out of an original six Fischers', similarly
housed, have proved equally hardy.

LONG FLIGHT OF A BARRABAND PARRAKEET

<bodyText confidence="0.998503133333333" page_id="56185775"  page_num="78" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- On the morning of the recent blizzard a large cypress tree
in my garden was blown down, unfortunately killing in its fall the
youngest of the Sula Island King Crimson-wing hybrids which I had
trained as a day-liberty bird. The crash of the falling tree startled a
young cock Barraband, bred this year by Madame Lecallier and not
trained very many weeks to fly at liberty, and rising high in the air he
became confused by the snowflakes and allowed himself to be carried
away in a south-westerly direction by the furious gale. Some days
later he was seen on the further side of the Isle of Wight, and after
being absent over a week, he turned up again, looking not a penny
the worse for his adventures. It is difficult to know which is the more
extraordinary circumstance ; that a Barraband should be able to
survive for nine days of the worst and wildest winter weather we have
had for years, when the species, unlike the Broadtail family, is usually
quite unable to exist, even in summer, for more than three days without

Mr. S. Harvey, of Adelaide, in a letter to our Hon. Secretary, under
date 8th November, 1927, writes : " About 22nd September two pairs
of Turquoisines and one pair of Princess Alexandras were sitting. They
all seemed to start sitting the same day. After a week one pair of
Turquoisines deserted the nest. I removed the log and there was one
broken egg. I cleaned the log and put it back in the same position, and
after about a fortnight they started again, and are now going along all
right. The Princess Alexandras went on sitting for nearly three weeks,
and then deserted the nest. They had six eggs, five with young ones,
nearly ready to come out. After three weeks they made another start,
and have now been sitting nearly a fortnight. The other pair of
Turquoisines went on all right, and now have four young ones flying.
Oue came out on 6th November, and three on 7th November. The
father of these I reared last season, and he is just twelve months old.
The hen was aviary-bred about the same time."

made it into a skin. They allowed Mr. Harvey to send it to our Hon.

Society and before the British Ornithologists' Club. It is a gynan-
dromorph specimen possessing characters, both external and doubtless
internal (though we do not know if these were examined), of both sexes.
The plumage is most interesting, being equally divided bilaterally,
complete male plumage on the right side and female on the left. Such
birds may be capable of actually laying eggs, though it is doubtful
if these are ever fertile, and Mr. Harvey tells us that this bird did
actually lay eggs last season, but nothing came of them. Some of
our older members may remember a similar case of a Bullfinch which
was exhibited at a Crystal Palace Show a good many years ago. I
remember wondering why a cock Bullfinch was exhibited in the " freak "
class, as I viewed it standing sideways to me, but when it turned
round it presented the aspect of a hen !

THE PLUMED JAY (CALLOC ITT A FORMOSA)
By G. H. Gurney, F.E.S., F.Z.S.
The very fine pair of Jays or Pies depicted in the accompanying
plate were imported from Central America in April, 1927, and were
acquired by me soon afterwards. They appear to be the first living
examples of this species to reach this country. The excellence of the
plate renders a further description of them unnecessary. The genus
Callocitta, which only numbers two species, is very closely allied to the
Asiatic genera Cissa and Urocissa, which includes the well-known
species U. occipitalis. Indeed my C.formosa much more resemble Pies
than Jays. Why they are called formosa it is hard to say, they have
certainly never been found anywhere near the island of Formosa,
which is off the east coast of China. There is, however, a tract of
country in Central Paraguay in South America called Formosa ; and
it is possible the original type-specimens may have come from there.
The British Museum Catalogue of Birds gives the habitat of this species
as Central America: Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Pica, Nicaragua,
Honduras. When my birds arrived they were in very good condition,
and now having moulted are in perfect order. I believe them to be
a true pair. They share an aviary with a Black Pie, Cryptorhina

afra, and I should not dare put any smaller birds with them, as
they have all the carnivorus instincts of the Pies ; though they are
extremely fond of all kinds of fruit, as well as mice and very small
birds. They appear to be fairly hardy, and do not mind the cold.

I am afraid that any notes on the latter bird will only be in the-
form of an obituary notice, for although I possessed three birds, a
very fine cock and two hens, only one reached these shores alive, and]
lived for about two years in my aviaries, and was eventually sent with
a bird of the former species to the Zoological Gardens.
Both species of birds came down from the uplands of Tanganyika
Territory, and were brought to Tanga, where I received them from
my friend Mr. Schulz. The male of the Hildebrant's Francolin w~as a
beautiful little creature and very strikingly coloured, the upper parts,
being brown, very finely mottled with black and buff, the lower parts,
white with a large heart-shaped black spot near the end of each feather,,
the throat white, spotted with black. The females were much smaller
than the male, but more or less like him on the upper parts, but the-
under parts were a brownish brick colour. The great difference between
the two sexes, which is very unusual in the Francolins, has caused con-
siderable confusion, and male and female have been described several!
times as different species. The beak, legs, and feet are a striking coral red..
When in the Red Sea the male one day knocked his head on the
top of his crate so badly that he had a fit and was lying in my hands,,
apparently dead, when he suddenly came to life and, before I could,
grasp him, had flown into the sea and was speedily devoured by the.
hungry sharks, much to my chagrin. One of the females succumbed
to the cold in the Bay of Biscay, and so only one landed safely here
and lived a peaceable life with the little Dusky Francolin. In am

aviary they were quiet unobtrusive birds, fairly tame and confiding,
though by no means interesting pets, apart from their rarity. Both
birds had a distinctive crow, which they uttered when perching in
the trees.
The Francolins, of which about forty-four species are known,
inhabit most of the northern, southern, and tropical parts of Africa,
by far the great proportion being found in the south and in the Eastern
tropical regions, and only one or two species in the northern portion.
Three species are found in Asia, one of these extending into Europe,
even being found once in Spain and Sicily, but it has long since been
exterminated from both places. Two more species are found in the
Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo.
In their habits and also in appearance, they resemble the Partridges,
being for the most part terrestrial, and living in small coveys on the
dry bush veldt. They are omnivorous in their diet, feeding upon seeds,
insects, berries, roots, buds, and tender sprouting plants. The only
exception is the genus Pternistes, the birds of which live in trees usually
in marshy places and by rivers, though they find most of their food on
the ground.
In Matabeleland, in the districts bordering the Kalahari Desert and
in the Transvaal, they are very numerous, fifteen species being found
south of the Zambesi River, which divides the temperate from the
tropical regions.
The Coqui Francolin is one of the smallest, but is the most beautiful
of all the Francolins. I have kept it in captivity in Africa, but owing
to the birds being captured when adult, they were shy and retiring
and very difficult to tame, though no doubt hand-reared specimens
would make delightful pets.

when acclimatized, hardy and long-lived. I had one for eight years,
and it was only killed by accident in my absence. The Purple Sunbird

has the best song; loud, cheerful, and continuous. The Double-
collared Sunbird, and indeed all those with the brilliant scarlet
colouring, lose their brightness in captivity and become a dull yellow,
which must be the result of something wanting in their food, as a
double-collared that was let out of the aviary by mistake and lived in
a neighbouring garden in the herbaceous border for a week in August
had already begun to show the red colour coming through the yellow
when it returned of its own accord to its cage. It is now eight years
old. Most Sunbirds are very vindictive to their own species, even the
pairs, and I have known a cock kill his hen, not by fighting but by
keeping her away from the food pot. The only way to prevent this
would be to have a number of food pots far apart in the aviary, but
even then, I believe, those who have had these birds flying loose have
found that they do better when caged separately. I find keeping them
caged, and let out for a fly round in a garden aviary each in turn for
a day in the summer months, keeps them in perfect health and happi-
ness, but of course this is impossible in a large collection. The food
consists of the usual mixture of Nestle's milk, Mellin's food, honey, and
a speck of Marmite, mixed with boiling water and given fresh twice
a day in the summer, with any insects that can be captured ; and some
will suck the inside of a mealworm if held up to the bars--one a day is
enough. Here is also a recipe from the late Mr. Brooks of Hoddam
Castle. To make one pint of liquid food. *

The usual recipe is simpler, and quicker to make, and I find my
birds like it just as well, and with a cage large enough to give plenty
of exercise by flying backwards and forwards, and with a bath hung
up every day for an hour in the morning, you will find any Sunbird
far easier to keep than a Waxbill or other seed-eater.

It is customary to call certain small Ducks Teal, but the word
does not imply any real distinction.
The Common Teal (A. crecca) is very small. It inhabits northern
Europe and Asia, migrating south in winter. The male has a slight
crest at the back of the head, fine mahogany colour, and a wide green
stripe edged with white on the sides. His breast is pale fawn with
brown spots ; mantle and sides vermiculated black and white, wings
and tail black and white, abdomen white, the speculum and a stripe
across the wing are fawn, bill and feet black. It is a hardy species in
confinement. The call of the male is like the Pintail's.
The Green-winged (A. carolinensis) of North America is only
distinguishable from the preceding by having two white lines encircling
its sides and breast. It has lately been imported and has been bred
in Europe.
The Baikal or Japanese Teal ( A.formosa ) is a charming Siberian
species which winters in China and Japan. It is slightly larger than
the above. The drake in breeding plumage has his head curiously
marked with black, green, fawn, and white ; the remaining plumage is
variegated with brown, blue grey, black, and white. Its bill is grey,
feet yellowish grey. Both male and female in summer are spotted
brown, with the characteristic spots lighter at the base of the bill and
at the back of the eye.
This is a freely imported species, but is very rarely bred in confine-
ment. Its short call is very distinct.
The Chestnut-breasted Teal (A. castanea) is rather large, and
reminds one of the Pintails by its length. The drake has a deep green
head and neck, above he is blackish; his breast, sides, and abdomen are
bright mahogany spotted black, there is a white spot near the tail
which is black, the wings are dark grey with a green and white speculum.
Feet and bill are black. The duck's plumage is deep brown, edged with
tawny, the speculum the same.
In summer the drake becomes much browner and his feathers lose
their lustre. He goes fully into eclipse. This fine species is very

prolific in Europe, but for all that has become very scarce; owing
doubtless to too close inbreeding, the percentage of females is very high.
The Grey Teal (A. gihberifrons) also comes from Australia. It is
found as well in Java and some of the Oceanic islands. Except that
they are slightly smaller, both sexes resemble the female of the preceding
species, and aviculturally are not of much interest.
The Cape Teal (A. capensis) from South Africa is pale grey with
brown spots, has yellowish grey feet and a red bill. Neither it nor its
neighbour the Madagascan Teal (A. bernieri) have yet been imported.
The latter has brownish fawn plumage, a black and white speculum
with green reflections, bill and feet red.
The Chilean Teal (A. flavirostris), south North America, recalls
the Chilean Pintail in miniature, but its plumage is greyer and more
finely marked, its bill, which is smaller in proportion, is yellow with a
black line above ; the speculum is green and fawn. It is quite hardy
and very elegant, but does not breed readily. A. georgica from the
island of Georgia and A. oxyptera from Bolivia and Peru resemble the
Chilean Teal.
The Andaman Teal (A. albogularis), Andaman Isles, is like the
Grey Teal, the only difference being that its face and throat are more
or less white. It has been bred in Europe, especially in the London
Zoological Gardens, but is not particularly ornamental.
The Hottentot Teal (A. punctata) from South, South-West and
East Africa is a very pretty little species, which has not yet been bred.
It is brown, speckled with black, and its head is pale yellow, black,
and blue-grey; the wings are wholly metallic green.
The Necklaced Teal (A. leucophrys) is one of the smallest and
probably quite the prettiest of Ducks. It is found in Bolivia, the
Argentine, and Brazil. The male, which does not go into eclipse, has a
fawn coloured neck and head with a black stripe above ; a rose coloured
breast with brown spots; abdomen tawny grey, often finely striped
with black ; sides grey blue ; mantle brown ; wings a mixture of deep
green, golden green, white, and black, having the mahogany coloured
tertiary flights prolonged, and tail black above, white ringed black
beneath ; blue-grey bill, pink feet. The female has a brown head with
white marks, a white throat, the body brown above, white with brown

spots beneath, wings like those of the male minus the mahogany
tertiaries, tail black, bill brown, feet black. This charming species is
hardy, but is a very capricious breeder.
The Brazilian Teal (A. hrasiliensis) reminds one of the perching
Ducks by its shape and long tail, but the voice of the drake somewhat
recalls that of the Tree Ducks, only it is much lower. The male does
not go into eclipse, is chestnut, with cheeks and sides whitish tawny,
and has a dark stripe at the back of the neck ; black marks on the
breast, black back and tail, the wdngs are nearly altogether of a splendid
deep green colour, with a white speculum, but they are unfortunately
hidden in repose by the chestnut tertiaries. The bill is dark red, feet
orange. The female has a dark grey bill, and a brown head, with
whitish spots in front and behind the eye ; yellowish grey feet.
This pretty species, a native of all east South America from Venezuela
to the Argentine, has proved hardy and ready to breed.
The Garganey (A. querquedula) , a native of Europe and Asia, is
peculiar in that it does not come into full plumage until the end of
winter, so that the male is eight months in eclipse. When in colour its
head is chestnut striped white, with wide white eyebrows and a dark
band on the nape ; its breast is chestnut netted with black, its sides
light grey vermiculated wdth black, abdomen pale grey ; mantle dark
brown edged with light brown, with pointed black and fawn feathers,
tail and coverts brown ; wings blue-grey, with green and white speculum
and brown flights. The female and the male in eclipse are tawny grey
with brown spots, with the same wings. The bill is black, the feet grey.
The Blue-winged Teal (A. discors) takes the place of the preceding
in America. It breeds in the United States and Canada, but goes
south in winter to Colombia and Venezuela. When in colour the male
is brown with black spots with deep blue-grey head and neck, a dark
stripe on the head, and a white crescent in front of the eye; grey blue,
green, and white wings, black tail with white coverts ; black bill,
orange, and black feet. It is late coming into colour. The female
is like that of the preceding species, but less grey and more brown, the
bill and feet are washed with orange. This is a rare species in European
collections, but it breeds freely.

both north and south. The male, when in colour, is bright red brown,
lightly spotted on the mantle, with black. There is a dark stripe on
the crown of the head. Its tail is black, wings grey blue and green,
some pointed black and tawny plumes, black bill, orange feet. The
female is like those of the two preceding species ; she often has a light
spot at the base of the bill.
Contrary to the two species above mentioned, this handsome Teal
does not long remain in eclipse, at most from June to September. It is
very ornamental, and a free breeder.
The Many-coloured Teal (A. versicolor), which is found to the
south of South America, has the crown of the head and back of the
neck black, the rest light fawn. Above it is black, barred white, below
white blotched black. The upper part of the wing grey blue, speculum
green washed with purple, flights brown. Bill grey blue, with a large
yellow spot below the nostrils, feet grey. The female resembles the
male. This species has become rare in confinement. A nearly allied
species (A. puna) inhabits the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, the chief
difference is its larger size, and the absence of the yellow spot on the bill.
The Marbled Teal (A. augusturostris) inhabits North Africa, and
extends to Persia and North-West India ; it is also found in South Spain.
Of medium size, it is tawny grey, spotted with greyish white, brown
round the eyes ; bill grey blue, feet dark brown. The sexes are alike.
It is uncommon and delicate in confinement, but has been bred by the
Duke of Bedford.
The Shovellers (Spatula) form a very distinct genus, specially
noticeable for their enormous bills, provided with wide plates.
The Common Shoveller (S. clypeata) is found in Europe, Asia,
and America, going down south in winter. The male has a green head
and neck, pale blue wing coverts, green speculum, the sides and under
parts are chestnut, the back, flights, and tail grey and black, the rest
is white, black bill, orange feet. In summer he is light brown, spotted
with dark brown. The female is like the Wild Duck.
The Shoveller requires animal food, and does not do well in a small
place, but, given a large pond, it is hardy, and will breed.
Three exotic species inhabit southern countries, and are very like
the Common Shoveller; they are duller and do not go into eclipse.

The Australian Shoveller (S. rhynchotis) is brown with black
spots, has blue and green wings and tail, a grey head, with a more or
less distinct white crescent on the cheeks.
The Cape Shoveller ( S. capensis) is greyer brown, with darker
green wings and tawny head, speckled with black.
The Busty Shoveller (S. platalea) from South America is known
by its russet black spotted plumage. The females of these species are
like that of the European Shoveller, only more spotted. As yet none
of them have reached Europe alive, but they are not strikingly
ornamental.
The Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceas) of Australia
has a large bill like the Shovellers, but is provided as well with long
membranes on each side, which give it a comical appearance. It is
grey, with head, neck, and under parts striped black and white, a circle
round the eye and a stripe behind it are black, and it has a soft pink
spot behind the eye ; its bill and feet are grey. The sexes are alike.
This species has never been imported.
We may mention in passing the Brown Teal op New Zealand
(Elasmonetta chlorates), short winged with brown plumage, prettily
vermiculated with black, grey head, shading into green behind the
eye, with a white line on the breast, feet and bill grey. The female is
brown. It appears not yet to have been imported. A species peculiar
to the Auckland Isles ( Nesonetta auklandica ) has still more rudimentary
wings and cannot fly, its plumage is like that of the Australian Teal.
A specimen has been shown by the Zoological Society of London.
In conclusion, we may mention to complete the genus a curious
Duck from the Argentine and Chili, Heteronetta atricapilla, and the
scarce Spotted Duck of Australia ( Slictonetta noevosa) ; neither of them
have ever been received here alive.

In districts where prolonged periods of very low temperature are
frequently experienced, to just keep the frost and damp out of one's
bird room, aviary, or shelter, more especially at night, gives the true
aviculturist that feeling of satisfaction that his birds are at least
comfortable in the most severe weather.
In the case of sick birds or birds showing the least signs of going off
colour, the heated bird room is a necessity, where such birds can
promptly be placed with an excellent chance of recovery, thereby
minimizing one's casualties and saving money.
After exhaustive experiments wdth various methods of heating
my bird room with oil stoves, lamps, radiators, and gas-heaters--all
having the great disadvantage of emitting fumes and creating an oily
" smelly " atmosphere, I eventually installed an electrical tubular
heater and find this the nearest approach to perfection.
The system has the unique advantage of providing warmth over a
large area at an even temperature.
The tube itself never becoming more than what I might term
black hot ", very little protection is necessary against contact by
the birds, netting or gauze answering the purpose admirably.
The heaters themselves consist of an electrical element mounted
Inside metal tubes of any desired length with a diameter of about 3 inches
and can be either clipped with brackets to the skirting or floor or
screwed in any desired position.
An ordinary adapter or plug is then inserted to the nearest lamp-
holder or plug point of one's electrical supply, and by means of a
short, or any disused, length of flexible wire is connected to the tube
itself.
The elements are supplied in any voltage, and the tube manufactured
in lengths from 2 feet, rising in 1 foot lengths, to 7 or 8 feet, and placed
in position where the even distribution of the heat is most desired.
The necessary length of tubing required is naturally dependent upon
the heat it is desired to maintain, and the consumption of current
necessary to heat one's bird room or aviary is influenced by several
factors--chiefly the size of room or aviary, materials of which one's
room or aviary is constructed, geographical position, outside
temperature, etc.

F. Finn--Notes on Humming-Birds
The elements themselves are supplied loaded to 50 or 60 watts per
foot, and for the desired purpose I recommend the lower loading,
although, where area is to be considered, the higher loading would
naturally reduce the length of tube required.
Take, for example, a small, well-conducted bird room or outside
aviary where an even temperature of say 55* to 60* would be sufficient
to keep one's birds in a happy and healthy condition ; during a sudden
drop in temperature outside a short length of tubing 5 feet would
answer this purpose, the tube loaded with 50 watts per foot would mean
a consumption of 250 watts per hour.
Most electricity undertakings, I believe, supply current for heating
appliances at a considerably reduced rate, and presuming, for example,
the heating rate to be one penny per unit, it will readily be seen that
four hours' consumption of electrical heat can be obtained for one
penny.
The tubes themselves are inexpensive, and the cost of installing
very little. Any member interested can obtain the name and address
of the suppliers from me if they so desire.

NOTES ON THE HUMMING-BIRDS RECENTLY

By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
A few notes I made on some of the species of Humming-birds
exhibited last year at the Zoological Gardens may be worth recording,
especially as all, I believe, were new to British aviculture. Probably
much of the difficulty in keeping these birds lies in the fact that no
species has been " tried out 55 .
The one species of Hermit (Phcethornis) exhibited was remarkable
for its extreme energy. At first, though it did not survive long, it was
the most frequently on the wing of all the species shown, and the power
of its wings was such that when it was in flight at the top of its cage the
grass on the turf at the bottom was agitated by the draught produced,
which I did not notice in the case of any of the other species shown.
In repose the bird constantly moved its tail up and down, unlike any

of the others. The tail was not raised up to the level of the back, but
the motion was very noticeable, in fact, I may say that as far as my
observation of the bird went, it was never still, the tail being in action
all through the short spells of perching. I once saw it yawn, and then
the lower jaw appeared red, the blood-vessels showing through the
thin horn of bone.
Although the smallest species exhibited, the tiny White-tailed
Hummer (Elvira albicauda) was one of the longest livers. It was almost
constantly in motion, seldom settling longer than a minute.
The bulk of the collection consisted of specimens of Debus's
Humming-bird (Amazilia dubusi), and, as two of these long survived
all the rest of the consignment, one being lost by escape, I was able to
study this species pretty thoroughly, as I visited the birds about twice
a week nearly all the time they were exhibited.
Judging by their plumage, the two last birds of this species were
hens or young, but they looked very different at most times, because
their ways and poses were so different; in fact, I have never noted so
much difference between the individuals of any bird. They differed
more than either did from any of the other species except the Hermit,
and this is one of the points that go to show that the Humming-birds
probably have as much personality as other birds, and are not insect-
like automata--not that I believe insects are so completely automatic
as many naturalists do, for I think personality is practically universal
among animals.
Dubus A, as I will call the bird which escaped, was almost constantly
on the move, seldom settling for more than a minute. When thus
settled, it appeared close-feathered and alert, and showed much green
in its plumage, though on occasion when I saw it with the plumage
relaxed, it had no more than Dubus B, as I will call the other. Although
so active, Dubus A, except on one occasion, always settled on the edge of
the food-pan when sucking up the food, and did not hover there like
all the other specimens shown. On one occasion, after scratching its
beak with its foot, it grasped it for a moment in the toes, but I never
saw in this consignment any of the deliberate wiping down of the
beak with the toes which I observed in some of the Humming-birds
brought over before the war by Captain A. Pam from Venezuela.

F. Finn--Notes on Humming-Birds
This may be a speciality of Lampornis prevosti, specimens of which lived
longest in this lot. 1
Dubus B was always sluggish, and was generally sitting still with
the plumage relaxed, while A next door was busily buzzing about.
Thus it looked very different and much less green. Its tail was often
partly spread, and it plumed and scratched itself much, unlike Dubus A.
The scratching was done by lifting the foot up between the lowered
wing and the body, as by Passerine birds and some other groups. All
Humming-birds I have seen scratching themselves scratch in this way,
as opposed to the other method of scratching with the hock lowered
and wing closed.
I mention this, as method of scratching is one of the minor habits
which will probably turn out to be a group-character in birds. Although
so lethargic as compared with Dubus A, Dubus B always, except when
X last saw it shortly before its death, fed on the wing like the other
Humming-birds in the lot, and I have seen it pick up objects from the
ground--no doubt some of the fruit flies supplied--in this way.
I never saw any of these Humming-birds attempt to use their feet
in progression; they either sat still or flew. I have seen Dubus B
now and then spread the tail on the wing when executing some
manuoevre, but generally all the Humming-birds kept the tail closed
when hovering.
In fact, a good idea of a hovering Humming-bird's action may be
got by watching Sparrows hawking over high grass in the parks in
summer. I believe, however, the Sparrow keeps its feet drawn up in
front as in its ordinary flight, while after much watching of the Dubus
Humming-birds, especially B, I made out that the feet are kept down
with a slight backward inclination, which agrees with what I observed

Our member, Mr. J. B. Housden, has just sailed on another trip to
America, and hopes to spend some four months in the Gulf States,
during which most of his time will be devoted to bird observation.
We congratulate Mr. Housden, who is in his 78th year, on his enterprise
and wish him all success.
A fine collection of Australian Finches has recently reached London
in wonderfully good condition. They consist of Gouldians, Long-tailed
and Masked Grassfinches, Bichenos, Pectoral, Crimson, and Zebra
Finches. Such collections are seldom seen now-a-days, and it behoves,
all who purchase these birds to take the greatest care of them, and see
if it is not possible to keep them going for many years to come. Long-
tails and Masked Finches breed very freely in suitable aviaries, and
there is no excuse for letting them die out in this country. Gouldians
are less easy to establish, but they are not delicate when once they have
got over their first few weeks in this country. An outdoor aviary with
a warmed inner compartment and a grass lawn outside suits them
well, and with care there would seem to be no reason why they should
not be established over here in the same way as the Budgerigar has.
been. And why should we not establish a Gouldian Club ?
The new Bird House at the Zoological Gardens is now nearing
completion, and before this is in print the inside of the house will be
stocked, and the old house will be a bird house no more.
The outside aviaries, of which there will be seventeen, will not
be completed for some few weeks. It is hoped to publish a full account
of the house in our next number.

Sir,--M. Delacour in Lis extremely interesting article on " Bird
Keeping in Peking", referring to the feeding of insectivorous birds,
states that he has seen Blue and Ruby-throats fed for four or five years
on the food described in the best possible health. I am sure it would
interest members if he would tell us if the birds so fed and kept pre-
served their great distinctive beauty, the blue and ruby on the throat;
for if this be the case it must be a new and interesting fact to avi-
oulturists, as I have always understood that the great beauty of these
birds is lost after the first moult in captivity. It would be indeed
interesting, if the Chinese had discovered the secret of its preservation,
.and I am myself convinced that there is between the plumage of birds
and the food they live on a close and interesting connexion. The case
of the Yellow-breasted Cissa described in the last December number
is a case in point. And I myself have come across a most interesting
case in India.
The Indians keep birds, as do the Chinese, mainly as pets and for
fighting, and a favourite is the Red-vented Bulbul. Indians feed
insectivorous birds on a mitxure of finely chopped raw kidney, the
flour of the parched chick pea, and ghee, which is clarified butter,
though the young are reared mainly on grasshoppers. The kidney
is first chopped very fine : it is then dipped in the flour and well
covered ; the ghee is then heated and the kidney, covered with the flour,
is then placed in the melted ghee and mixed till the ghee is absorbed.
On this, with a few insects, Shamas and other insectivorous birds are
kept in health. But it is curious that when the Bulbul, which is largely
frugivorous, is reared and fed on this, as it can be, the beautiful grey
mottling of its plumage goes and the red feathers of the vent become
tinged with black. The white feathers on the rump, so distinctive
a mark, become black, as does the plumage generally: yet when a
bird so coloured is moulted out on insects and fruit, it resumes the
beauty of its original plumage. The case of the Bullfinch fed on hemp is
perhaps analogous. And it may well be that the loss by the Linnet and
the Redpoll in captivity of their great beauty, the crimson of the

breast and head, is due to the absence of some food in captivity. Seeing
that the beauty of their plumage is one of the great charms of birds,
the relation of food to colour is a matter of great interest to bird
lovers and would well repay attention.
M. Delacour's visit to Pekin may help to set us on the way. Would
he oblige us with this information about the Blue and Ruby-throats ?
Bechstein, writing of the Blue-throat, says : " It is unfortunate that
it gradually loses the fine blue on the breast in successive moultings,
when confined to the house, and becomes at length of a whitish grey."
But the Chinese must have kept Blue-throats centuries before Bechstein.

NESTING OF THE VIRGINIAN EAGLE OWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993585809523809" page_id="56185812"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
Sir,- --A pair of these Owls (Bubo virginicmus) in Mr. J. S. Lewis'
Owlery at Wargrave have dug themselves a scrape in the earth of their
shed behind a big log and gone to nest. As in the wild state they usually
build or adapt nests in trees they were well provided with baskets,
boxes, and hollow stumps, but these they utterly ignored save as hiding
places for bits of rabbit.
For some time they had been carrying small pieces of dry turf
which they arranged in sundry corners, and then paid no more attention
to them. It is curious that while this particular pair have several
times been moved from one aviary to another and only lately found
themselves in their present home, others which were kept carefully
secluded in the hope that they might breed, have so far done nothing.
A week ago the hen signified her intention of being left to herself
by attacking the aviary boy when he went to clean out the shed.
She struck her talons through his cap, making a gash on the side of his
head, fortunately not a serious wound. She and her mate also took
to hooting defiantly when their compartment was approached.
As is usual with Owls, she began to incubate at once, and only
comes off the nest towards evening for a hurried bath and a stretch ;
should anybody come into sight she is back to her scrape in a moment,
so it is impossible to say how many eggs there are in her clutch.

According to the books there are usually two, but sometimes three or
even four. Incubation lasts four weeks.
Meanwhile her mate sits on guard outside the door and carries
in food. They are fine birds in beautiful plumage, and have been
from three to four years in confinement.

Sir, --Watching the Sheathbills at the Zoo the other day, I was
much interested to notice that they put their feet on pieces of meat
in order to hold them steady while they picked at them--a habit which
I have not seen recorded, and did not expect in a bird of the Limicoline
group. The habit of using the feet for prehension in birds seems
generally a very limited and comparatively invariable one--thus,
I have only once seen a Starling of any sort holding anything in its
feet, and that was a Pied Starling ( Sturnopastor contra) in India, which
was carrying a twig to its nest in that way--a genius, I suppose, like
Romanes' horse that gripped with its pastern-joint.

A PUZZLING GREY PARROT
Sir, --At the end of last year or early in this I saw in the establish-
ment of Mr. G. Palmer, at Park Street, Camden Town, a Grey Parrot
which had the completely black beak of the ordinary Psittacus erithacus,
but the dark slaty crimson tail of P. timneh. The plumage generally
was also dark, but this is well known to be a variable point in the Grey
Parrot. If this bird were a hybrid, it was a remarkable one, with
the beak of one parent and the tail of the other ; but, as many years
ago I saw a Grey Parrot with one outer tail feather in the scarlet tail
slate colour with a splash of scarlet, I take it that erithacus tends some-
times to vary in the direction of timneh , and that the bird I saw recently

<bodyText confidence="0.999081555555555" page_id="56185814"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Examples of this distressing perversity have occurred here
from time to time, and it is in the hope that some cause may be
suggested that I call attention to it.
Small species such as Scops and Glaucidium seem most prone to it,
though I once heard of a Barn Owl killing and eating another which
was in the same aviary. As, however, they had been fed entirely
on raw meat without either fur or feather, the unnatural food may be
held responsible for this lapse.
No such excuse can be made for the birds here ; they are well
supplied with as varied a diet as possible.
In each case the culprits were true pairs, had been several months
together, and appeared devoted to each other, always sitting side
by side, and showing distress if separated for any reason. The Glau-
cidium were caged, but the Scops giu and Athene hrama were in com-
partments amply large enough for them to keep out of each other's
way. In the case of the Athene they were sitting close together at
10 o'clock, and by noon one had killed, plucked, and partly eaten
the other.
A curious feature is that the victim never defends itself. Given
a well-matched pair in good health one would expect a struggle before
one was overpowered, and that the survivor would show some marks
of the conflict by the loss of feathers at least if not a more serious
wound, but it is not so. The conqueror, presumably the agressor, never
has so much as a feather awry, but sits sleek and complacent above the
mangled remains of its late companion and friend. Thwarted sexual
impulse does not appear to. have anything to do with it, for the murder
may be committed at any time of year.

clutch of eggs in the process of incubation. The father is a Many-
colour Parrakeet, the mother a Redrump, and she was fortunate enough
to get her eggs all laid during the recent warm spell. I take it that
such an obvious cross must have been frequently bred before, but I
should be interested to know what the young hybrids look like, and also
whether anyone has taken the trouble to prove if they are fertile or not.
Edward J. Boosey.
[Though we cannot find any record of the cross, we feel sure that
it has been obtained, and that a specimen has been exhibited.-- Ed.]

<bodyText confidence="0.982474" page_id="56185815"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In Scopoli's Annus Historico-Naturalis, i, is given a Latin
description of a bird which he saw in the Imperial Menagerie (at
Schonbrum, I believe) and called Coracias cartagenensis ; this description
can fit nothing but one of the races of the Sulphury Tyrant, and, as
this bird, though now and then imported, has never even yet become
popular or familiar in aviculture, I thought it was worth while to draw
attention to the fact that a comparatively out-of-the-way species like
this had been imported into Europe as long ago as the eighteenth
century.

This is perhaps the finest of the whole group of red-legged Partridges,
and differs from the others in the possession of elongated feathers on
the chin and throat, forming a beard, and on the crown, forming a
small crest. The tail is also longer proportionately than in the other
species. It inhabits Arabia, but, according to Colonel R. Meinertyhagen
its distribution is still somewhat obscure.
These splendid Partridges are rarely obtainable in Europe and,
as a rule, do not survive for any great length of time, unless kept on
very dry soil, for being desert birds they cannot stand a damp situation.
Mr. Herbert Whitley bred them very freely in Devonshire during the
summer of 1927 , in a comparatively small, covered aviary, and found
no difficulty in rearing the young until they were half grown, when the
majority contracted gapes and died.
The hen laid altogether upwards of 50 eggs between February and
September, and the incubation period proved to be 24 days.
Had it not been for the gapes epidemic, doubtless partly accounted
for by the exceptionally wet summer, a large number would have been

A. A. Prestwick--The New Bird-house at the Zoo
reared, but as it was, only six were fully reared, and are alive to-day,
one having been exhibited at the Crystal Palace show in February.
The eggs can be hatched and the chicks reared by small domestic
hens, but if the coop is placed on damp soil, and the chicks allowed
to run in the open, they are liable to suffer unless the soil is sandy and
very dry.
Given a prolific species such as this, one sees possibilities of increasing
its numbers to almost any extent, if only the right conditions can be.
provided, and this should not be impossible of attainment.
THE NEW BIRD-HOUSE AT THE ZOO
By A. A. Prestwich
In the Avicultural Magazine for January, 1927, is an article
contributed by Capt. H. S. Stokes, entitled " The Small Bird House
at the Zoo ". Capt. Stokes ends by writing " The house is condemned
to be pulled down to make way for the large new ape and monkey
house, and the birds are to be transferred to the old reptile house, where,
let us hope, the authorities will provide as good quarters and as
attractive a display as we have at present".
The conversion of the old " Reptile House " is now complete, and
the new " Small Bird House " is open to the public. A remarkable
transformation has been accomplished and when the reconstructed
house is visited it is difficult to believe that it was once the " home of
reptiles Capt. Stokes' hopes are surely more than fully realized
and the London Zoological Society now possesses a house worthy of
containing its superb collection of small birds.
Not only aviculturists, but all visitors in general, owe a debt of
gratitude to " Our Editor " for his untiring efforts in supervising the
construction and furnishing of this " Mecca " of all lovers of foreign
birds. It is the aim of the authorities to exhibit a really representative
collection of birds, and this they succeed in doing. Well over five
hundred birds--ranging in size from an Indian White-eye to a Great-
Indian Hornbill--are now on view. As hitherto the birds are in charge
of Tanner, ably assisted by Raggett and Jones.

On entering by the western main door the first thing to catch the
eye is the fine large aviary, which has been constructed on the site of the
old central alligator pool. This is furnished with several large shrubs,
and is at present tenanted by a very interesting mixed series, amongst
which we noted examples of a Mexican Barred and Grey-throated

The foregoing lists are somewhat long and probably of little interest
to members who are able to visit the Zoo, but to readers domiciled
abroad they will possibly convey some little idea of the great variety
of birds on view. Attached to the house are seventeen large outdoor
flights which are nearing completion; when stocked they will
add further charm to an already very excellent display.

The old Small Bird House at the Zoological Gardens was presented
to the Zoological Society by the late Mr. Czarnikow in 1907, before which
there was no house in the Zoo suitable for the smaller foreign birds.
For twenty years it has housed a valuable collection, and has been a
great attraction not only to aviculturists but to the general public as
well. But it was never regarded as anything but a temporary structure.
It was built for the most part of wood, covered with asbestos sheeting,

the hollow walls forming a wonderful harbour for mice, which could
never be properly kept in check.
When, in 1926, the Council decided to build a new house for reptiles,
I was asked if the old Reptile House could be adapted to accommodate
birds. I had for a long time seen the possibilities of this house, and at
once agreed to the suggestion and commenced to make plans showing
the necessary alterations that would be required to make it into a
first-rate bird-house. Work was commenced last summer and the
inside of the house completed and the birds transferred thereto on
22nd March, 1928. The outside aviaries are rapidly nearing com-
pletion, and when finished will accommodate many of the birds from the
Western Aviary as well as those from the old Small Bird House. The
house is a very well-built structure, 108 feet by 60 feet, lighted from the
roof. In the middle, in the spaces formerly occupied by crocodile and
alligator tanks, have been erected three ornamental aviaries, the centre
one being 32 feet by 20 feet, the side ones 20 feet by 10 feet. On the
north, east, and west sides are a series of aviaries, twenty-two in number,
suitable for Hornbills, Toucans, and Birds of Paradise, while on the
south side are rows of cages in two tiers for such birds as do best in these.
To show themselves to advantage birds need to be surrounded by
vegetation, and this has been provided. The large middle aviary
contains a number of large bay-trees and some bamboos in tubs, while
palms, bay-trees, and hanging baskets of ferns decorate the house.
The heating system has been entirely remodelled. It is a low-
pressure hot-water system, with the flow pipes carried overhead,
returning by means of three rows of 4 in. pipes on the north, east, and
west, and radiators on the south side of the house. For large buildings
low-pressure hot-water heating has proved itself to be the best and most
economical system that has yet been devised. The former vestibule of
the house, which is 35 feet long, is being formed into the inside com-
partments of three large aviaries with wired external flights, new
entrance doors to the house being formed at either side of this, where
there were windows before. In addition to these aviaries there are no
less than fourteen other outdoor aviaries on the south and west sides,
the covered portions being of brickwork, warmed by radiators and
communicating with open flights planted with turf and shrubs. In

addition to opening skylights for ventilation, there have been installed
in the roof four exhaust fans, which can be switched on as required.
In dull weather the house and outside aviaries can be lighted by
electricity, special " Restlight " lamps, which produce a very truthful

THE FINE ART OF AVICULTURE
By Leon Patrick, M.D. (California)
Unlike the poet, the real aviculturist is born--and then made.
To have been endowed by nature with an inherent love for birds and
*a natural aptitude for the care of them is not enough, he needs must
add to these essential attributes the knowledge acquired by
"experience--both his own and that of others.
Just as art is the expression of man's joy in his work, so is aviculture
-one of the rare mediums for the expression of his feelings. And, as we
-develop our mentality and finer qualities of heart the urge for con-
servation evolves into action and aviculture becomes one of our keenest
necessities and greatest delights.
The evolution of aviculture has been synchronous with the growth
and development of mankind. To hark back to the genesis of aviculture
is to be confronted with the myths and mysteries of Time.
In the cradle of the human race, Asia, we would naturally expect
to find indications of primitive care for birds, and so it is. Early
records of Asia Minor testify to the use of doves or pigeons for carrying
messages, and such use necessitates the maintenance of houses or
shelters for the propagation of the birds ; these must have been provided
in very early stages of the domestication of the birds, certainly at a
remote period. The shelves for swallows in Japanese temples and the
feeding towers with nesting places mentioned by the Brahmans of
India are no innovation ; on the contrary, they must have, among these
nature worshippers, an antiquity going back to the very beginnings of
their religions.

Nowadays, aviculture is imperative, if certain rare and beautiful
species are to be perpetuated for the pleasure and benefit of posterity.
Those wise children of light who do their own thinking reasoned this
out years ago. Others, less thoughtful and more credulous, are labouring
under the erroneous idea that the bureaucratic protectionists have the
only plausible plan of perpetuating those avian beauties now threatened
with extinction. That the facts are against them is common knowledge.
The Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the Carolina Conure
(Conuropsis carolinensis) have become extinct under the perfectly
functioning regime of the protection enthusiasts. Meanwhile, the Wood
Duck and the Wild Turkey have been saved from a similar fate by being
propagated in captivity. These are but two of the many picturesque
and instructive object lessons in conservation furnished by intelligent
aviculture.
Our age is one that does not readily tolerate the camouflaging of
fact by the fog of bureaucracy. As the common denominator of
education and intelligence rises, nature lovers become more insistent
in demanding of their departmental bureaucrats a candid admission
of the processes of pseudo-protection as administered to-day. And,
gradually, things are coming our way--slow it they may, but still
our way.
Another phase of aviculture as a necessity is the opportunity it
affords for scientific study and observation. In no other manner can
such complete and authentic information be obtained. It is in
aviculture that we see birds in some of their most jubilant activities.
Many observations which formerly were interesting and curious, but
apparently isolated, now seem to fit beautifully into a general scheme.
Nature lends her spirit to the feathered world, and what a wonderful
story the keen observer can read in these sprightly creatures ! We who
are absorbed in aviculture are coming to understand that bird-life
forms an ever-changing background for human life--indispensable,
yet always fanciful. And we learn why the birds, with their half-
million known species, are man's greatest allies in the struggle for
survival.
Of equal importance and perhaps even greater significance to the
average individual are the amenities of aviculture. As an avocation or

hobby it is emphatically unique and of paramount consideration-
appealing as it does to all red-blooded men and women, regardless of -
race, creed, occupation, social rank or financial rating.
Aviculture as a pastime or hobby is proving itself an avocation of
the highest order. It adapts itself to both indoor and outdoor accom-
modations. It opens up a field wherein the ornithologist may delve
and exercise his apocalyptic capabilities to their full, and gives
thousands of nature lovers a never-ending source of delight and
information. Educationally and economically its scope is limited only,
and in direct ratio, to the amount of time and money spent upon it.
It exerts a potent influence upon man's character, or mental and
physical estate. It is, withal, a beneficial and helpful diversion that
tends to make a good man better, and a well man more healthy and
efficient.
The ranks of the intelligentsia are full of aviculturists. But it is not
certain whether an intellectual is an intellectual because he is an
aviculturist, or is an aviculturist because he is an intellectual. Of course,
it is not claimed that all aviculturists are intellectuals. Some are other-
wise--the argument simply is that they are good men in spite of their
hobby.
Aviculture usually attacks the youth with a penchant for birdlore.
If he was predestined for an aviculturist, the hobby grows on him until
it becomes a necessity. The idea of doing something worth while--of
propagating rare and perhaps exotic species becomes an obsession. He
no longer confines his efforts to the common cage birds. He begins to
haunt the big bird stores ; he makes long stops before the flamboyant
denizens there displayed, and his whole being thrills with the longing
to possess. He walks up and down in a maze at the mysterious allot-
ments of Providence, that gives so much money to men to spend on their
appetites, and so little to men who would spent it in benevolence or
upon their refined tastes ! It is astonishing, too, how one's necessities,
multiply in the presence of the supply. One never knows how many
birds it is impossible to do without till he visits a real bird mart. One
is surprised to perceive at some bird bazaar or importer's shop,&apos; how
many species he really needs. He is satisfied that his life, up until now,
has been utterly drab and wholly devoid of desideratum. Suddenly he

is aware of having lived for years without certain birds which he is now
-satisfied that he cannot live without. Then and there is exercised all
those -subtle processes by which man contrives to convince himself
that he can afford to buy. No artful manager or efficiency expert ever
saw through a maze of financial embarrassments half so quickly as an
aviculturist can see his way clear to pay for what he wants. He
promises himself marvels of retrenchment; he will go without smokes
or shows or drive his automobile less, that he may purchase certain
birds to thrill his soul. Yea, he will raise birds, that he may buy more
birds. The appetite is insatiable.
He is now fairly launched in this, the most amiable of all avocations.
He registers the name and address of all those supposed to be avicul-
turists, and sooner or later he visits them all. He asks advice--and
follows it, more or less--perhaps less.
I might go on and on with- this indefinitely, referring to many more
typical characteristics that distinguish the aviculturist from the
proletarian.
Suffice it to say that the true aviculturist is invariably a confirmed
bibliophile. Next to the living birds he loves those rare volumes which
picture and describe them. Books and birds--birds and books--the
two are inseparable ! In the beginning he bought books at random, and
without examining them too closely. Little by little his taste is formed
and purified; he becomes fastidious ; he no longer buys without
knowing what he is about.
Such are the extravagant turns and the follies (not to mention the
disheartening episodes) of this passion which we call aviculture. But,
nevertheless, this passion, which sometimes degenerates into the mere
collecting of birds, which excites the emotions of young and old,
which stirs the soul to a point of sacrifice, and which, it must be allowed,
is one form of avarice--this passion, I say, has a rational basis, it has a
noble origin and a justifiable objective. Aviculture is an elevated
avocation, for it has for foundation the love and perpetuation of nature's
feathered aristocrats.

By J. Bradshaw
During recent months a keen controversy has existed among breeders
of these little Parrakeets as to whether or no the hereditary factors
44 mendelize To be strictly applicable it is required that the crossing
of Blue with Blue-bred birds, e.g. should produce among the youngsters
50 per cent Blues, while the mating of Blue-bred with Blue-bred should
produce 25 per cent Blue. One school says that the theory works out
perfectly correctly, the other maintains that results cannot be fore-
casted with any certainty. Some enthusiasts insist that the percentages
44 come true every time when clutches are full If by this is meant
that every pair of Blue-bred birds produces 25 per cent of Blue, it
must be pointed out that theory does not demand such rigid adherence.
The results are subject to an error which, it is suggested, is given by the
following formula :--
where jp 1 and jp 2 are the percentages of Blue and non-Blue respectively
and n is the number of young produced. When n is small, this allows
of a wide margin, and the actual production of the theoretical percentage
does not prove anything for or against the theory.
With regard to the above formula and others of a similar character,
it may be stated that, while they are quite all right from the standpoint
of the mathematician, even he often regards them as somewhat artificial,
while the layman often looks upon them as something in the nature
of a 44 wangle
It is a pity that so few people have kept breeding records in such a
form as to make a critical examination possible, for the matter can only
be adequately tested by means of large numbers of examples.
In the cases quoted below the Blue-bred birds all possessed one
Blue parent, being produced in aviaries where Blue birds of one sex
were paired to Blue-breds of the other sex ; and these latter conditions
apply when Blues mated to Blue-breds are referred to. Unhatched
eggs have been disregarded, as no satisfactory method exists of bringing

them into account. Their disposal under any system is almost entirely
speculation, but perhaps the safest proceeding is to divide them up in
the same proportions as the hatched eggs. In quite a number of the
"ases, however, they could have no material bearing upon the results.

of error, the whole of the figures taken together give an actual yield of
104 Blues out of a total of 187 young, as against a theoretical 93'5.
This, however, is within the limits of error, which are 73 and 114. This
procedure, however, suggests jugglery, and the result could be easily
upset by the introduction of other examples instead of, or in addition
to, one of the cases above. These cases have been selected at random.
Cases 2, 3, and 4 combined give a result far removed from theory and
well outside the limits of error.
The idea that a long line of Blue ancestry is a factor to be taken
into account seems to be anathema to Mendelists. It is to be noted that
Case 1 above is taken from the records of some years ago, while 2 and 3
relate to a more recent period when the Blue-breds had a longer " Blue "
heredity. Mr. Porter's results were obtained from one pair of birds,
a Blue cock and a " pedigree " Blue-bred hen. The facts need not be
taken as conclusive evidence in favour of ancestry, since other factors
were at work. But that is another story. A few results from the mating
of Blue-bred birds inter se are now given :--

If we combine the six cases we have a total of 327 birds, with a
theoretical expectation of 81*75 Blues. Instead of this we get 32 Blues,
and are outside the stipulated limits which, with an error of 23*5 are
58*25 and 105*25. And here, again, it must be stated that case 2 refers
to the early stages of the operation.
While the mating of Bine with Blue-bred birds has produced in
recent years a number of Blues well in excess of the theoretical 50 per
cent and even above the limits allowed by theory, the same result has
not been obtained with the Blue-breds breeding among themselves.
In the latter case there has certainly been an increase in the percentage
of Blues obtained, but the expectation of 25 per cent has very seldom
been realized and has only been exceeded in isolated cases (e.g. one pair
of birds gave 50 per cent). The figure is usually not far removed from the
lower limit. The question is often asked : " Mendelism works with
other stock, why not with Budgerigars ? " Arguments from analogy
are never entirely satisfactory. There is no need to attempt an answer
until there is sufficient evidence to reach a decision upon the primal
question. At present the evidence is conflicting, and it is not surprising
that there is a sharp division of opinion.

lead to the conclusion that while it is difficult to obtain the theoretical
percentage of 25 per cent Blue from Blue-breds, the use of one Blue
parent continuously will lead to very satisfactory results. Also that if
there is any reality in the Mendelian percentages, they can only apply
to such a large number of birds as to render them of little practical
utility to the average breeder.
I was interested in Dr. Amsler's remarks in the December issue,
and note that he also obtained figures, with thirty birds bred Blue X
Blue-bred, which declined to conform to the theory even with its
generous margin for small numbers of birds. Perhaps other breeders
of Budgerigars may feel inclined to submit data bearing on the
question.

By George Hebden Corsan, Sen.
Back in 1911, in October, I chanced upon an auction sale of a farm
up the Valley of the Mimico, near Toronto, Canada, and charmed with
the beauty of the bit of valley, purchased that part of the farm. Huge
elms grew along the little creek ; tall white pines stood upon the hillside
facing north. This valley became my camping place, and my hobby.
In 1912 I secured some Canada Geese and placed them on the creek.
Almost immediately thereafter I brought some Snow Geese and some
Blue Geese to the little winding stream. Then, in the autumn of 1913,
I attended the Canadian National Exhibition at Toronto. Stopping to
talk with a man who was a breeder of large numbers of Bronze Turkeys,
I discovered he lived on the shores of Lake Huron, on the peninsular
that separates this lake from Georgian Bay. As we talked he told me
that one day a terrific north-west gale had blown into his farmyard
a lesser Snow Gander and a Blue Gander. These birds mixed with his
domestic Geese, and one day he closed them in his barn, caught them,
and sold them to a bird fancier at Maple, Ontario.

One of these Bine Geese, the gander leading, was bom up at the Arctic Circle, or
above it; the others were bred at Echo Yalley. The goose, mother of the younger
birds, is on the ground. She cannot fly, as she was wing-wounded when I bought her.
Three of these flying blues are still young enough not to have really white heads.
The others are a year older.

G. H. Corsan--Breeding the Blue Goose in Canada 115
One day I had occasion to go to Maple to purchase a female Black
Raccoon, and I recalled the conversation I had had with this Turkey
breeder. I called on the man to whom he had sold the Wild Geese,
finding him to be a storekeeper and undertaker. I looked at his fowl
and saw these two ganders in a pen, and I bought them for $15 (about
#3), bringing the birds back to Echo Valley with me. On releasing them
I did not think to examine their wings, and was astounded to see them
rise from the ground and fly, but, fortunately, they did not fly far, for
my other Blues and Snows called them back, and back they came.
That Blue Gander, I always noticed, had a dislike for water, so he must,
have had a bad experience in some stormy weather. The Snow Gander
paired with a Snow Goose, and they had many young, which he always
took up in the air for long flights about the valley. He never landed
off the place. But one day he flew into a new electric wire and
decapitated himself. The Blue Gander, however, is still living. That
first year, spring of 1914, he very strangely paired with a Toulouse
Goose, instead of with a Blue, and in the autumn when I visited my
valley I got rid of that Goose and their young. The next spring, 1915,.
this Blue Gander chose a Blue Goose and they were successful in raising
their babies. I remember I was quite surprised they did not have white-
heads, like their parents, when I returned in the autumn and my game-
keeper, Mr. John Huddleston, showed me the pair with their young.
During the next few years, from that autumn until 1918 my valley was
left to itself a great deal, with only a young lad coming in to feed the
birds each day. Then I secured another gamekeeper, who, alas ! was,
not as he should have been, although a good bird man. Many of my
Blue Geese disappeared in my absence, old ones as well as young ones,,
for the Blues continued their breeding.
Bendick Bros., of Leduc, Alberta, Canada, have bred Blue-
Geese. Mr. H. J. Jager, of Owatonna, Minnesota, ILS.A., bred
Blue Geese in 1925 or 1924, and a man who lives south of Mr. Jager,,
but whose name and address I have forgotten, also bred Blue Geese
previous to Mr. Jager's success, to be exact in 1922, but they were
killed from one cause or another, although they lived to six months of
age. The National Zoo at Washington, D.C., U.S.A., also bred Blue-,
Geese in 1925 or 1926.

My Blue Gander, the leader of the Blue Geese, is still with me,
although he has been mated to several Geese off and on, each Goose
being killed by mink or other predatory creature. At present he is
paired to a Blue Goose without the usual white head, and I am waiting
to see what their young this year will be like.

The Avicultural Society grows apace, for wdiich all lovers of our
feathered pets should be truly thankful. But in reading our Magazine
one cannot help noticing that the articles therein confine themselves
more to the rare and expensive birds than to those quite as interesting
but less costly.
Now it seems to me, that though this feature is good in homoeopathic
doses, it is not altogether the best method of promoting the interest
of aviculture in general, which I presume is the ultimate object of our
Society.
I think we should achieve greater success and popularity if more
attention were paid to the breeding and rearing of the more numerously
imported birds. Such items as details of food, conditions of housing,
local climatic conditions, are of paramount importance. One shudders
at the losses that occur among freshly imported foreign birds. Is it
not a laudable desire to diminish those losses, and so to some extent
close the mouths of those fanatics who would stop the caging of all
birds, and deprive thousands of true bird lovers the pleasure they derive
from seeing birds in good condition in real comfort and safe homes.
To reach this state of perfection, we as a Society should set an
example, and give freely and openly of our losses and successes, our
experiments by trial and error. For by such method only is any science
advanced.
Now for the benefit of those members interested, and who did
not see my note in the Magazine last May, pp. 136-8,1 will recapitulate
the conditions under which my birds dwell, and then give a copy of
my aviary diary for last twelve months.
The shores of south-west Lancashire are very exposed. Nevertheless

J. Appleby--Notes from a Lancashire Aviary 117
we have a fairly equitable climate and milder than many places further
south. For instance, we have had no snow to speak of this winter.
But (and it is a very large but) we have more than our share of
wind, fog, and wet sea mists, and a very poor allowance of sunshine
in comparison with Dorset and Wiltshire for instance.
Conditions, therefore, are not the most favourable for keeping foreign
birds in any condition.
However, by providing fairly roomy quarters (they have nearly
4,000 cubic feet of space, part of which is warmed up to 50* F. during
the months October to April), I have managed to cut down the per-
centage loss. But it is too high yet. The birds kept range from Pekin
Robins, Javas, Buntings, to the small Waxbills. They are fed on
canary, white millet, Indian millet, hemp, rice, oats, and grass seeds,
Spratts' C.L.O. food, Lark food, mealworms, earwigs, and other live-
stock as procurable. They have running water and the floors of the flights
are grassed. They are at liberty to sleep under cover or in the open.
The Siskins and Grey Singing Finches never sleep inside, whatever the
weather. The same applies to a cock Nonpareil and Red-crested Finch.
Most of the others do, except under most favourable conditions. Last
March I determined not to buy another bird for a year, with a view
to seeing if my district was a pneumonia area or not, and also testing
the resisting power of birds that had passed one winter under my
conditions. Taking things all round they seem to have come through
fairly well.
Although many nested and laid eggs, few have reared young,
generally due to some disturbing influence in the shape of another
bird of egg-stealing and nest-robbing propensities. I began the year
with 56 birds, and end with 43, and 40 of these have now spent two
winters here, are in finer feather and better colour and condition than
any freshly imported bird I have ever seen.

exchanging experiences and treatment that we can help on the science
of aviculture, and save the lives of our pets.

Sir, --Birds when bred in captivity require large aviaries, in which
it is possible--given the opportunity of a long flight, to keep themselves
in a healthy condition. Under these restrictions the whole system of the
birds will be working naturally, as in their wild state. The respiratory
organs will remain clear ; the lungs filled with oxygen from the air
will expel the poisonous carbon from the body, in the formation of
carbon-dioxide, a poisonous composition.
With flight the heart will continue its beat, consequently keeping
the blood in circulation.
I consider that in the breeding of birds the health of the individuals
is the primary factor.

HERMAPHRODITISM IN BIRDS

Sir, --The case of the gynandromorphical Gouldian Finch, the
subject of an article in last month's Magazine, is extremely interesting
to those who have studied hermaphroditism in the avian world.
We hear from time to time of such things as crowing Hens, Cocks
which lay eggs, the assumption of the male plumage by the female
or vice versa, and we are apt to be rather incredulous about them or
look on them as mere freaks and dismiss them from our minds as such,
but in reality they constitute one of those strange natural phenomena
which call for long and careful research.

The case of the crowing Hen, etc., is one of those obvious circum-
stances which through its special peculiarity is brought to the public
notice as also is the case of the Gouldian Finch, but hermaphroditism
in its various stages of gynandromorphism, etc., is far more common in
birds than we are led to believe, and it is very difficult to detect indeed
amongst birds in which there is no difference between the plumage of
the sexes.
Hermaphroditism is now generally assumed to have been developed
in the early embryonic life, and is due no doubt to either of two things
or possibly both, that the embryo after developing along the lines of
one sex will, for some inexplicable reason, gradually develop along
the lines of the opposite sex, thus giving the bird a mixture of both the
physical and mental characteristics of both, or while having the external
semblance of one sex will have the organic and mental characters of
the other. On the other hand, the embryo may develop with a
simultaneous mixture of the cells of both sex, thus giving the same result.
There is an extremely interesting article in the Transactions of the
Pathological Society of London, vol. lvii, part i, 1906, by Shattock and
Seligman, pointing out that " mere atrophy of the ovary cannot account
for the appearance in the hen bird of male characters, which are not
retrogressive, but progressive ", argues that such birds are really
bisexual or hermaphrodite either by the single ovary being really
bisexual, as was the case with a fowl they examined, or that the sexual
glands are paired, one being male and the other female, or else that there
is misplaced male tissue in a neighbouring viscus like the adrenal
or kidney, the male elements asserting themselves when the female
elements degenerate. " Hermaphroditism," they conclude, " far from
being a phenomena altogether abnormal amongst the higher
vertebrates should be viewed rather as a reversion to the primitive
ancestral phase in which bisexualism was the normal disposition."

depending almost entirely on importations from abroad to replenish
the stock of birds in their aviaries. Such breeding as is attempted is
often carried on in a desultory and haphazard fashion, with little care
to prevent degeneracy in the stock reared. Four species of Lovebirds--
Black-cheeked, Nyasa, Masked, and Fischers are being imported by
hundreds and there is a very special reason why these importations
should not continue, but the market be supplied with aviary-bred
birds. All these Lovebirds breed continually with only a short pause
for the moult, and there is no reason to suppose that they are any less
prolific in a wild state. I wonder how many people realize what this
involves in the way of cruelty ? It may safely be assumed that every
other pair of adult Lovebirds caught by the trappers--certainly one
pair in every three&apos;--have a brood in the nest which must perish
miserably of starvation on the loss of their parents. Looked at from this
point of view, the trade in live Lovebirds assumes almost as ugly an
aspect as the trade in Egret plumes. A pleasanter, if less cogent, reason
for more systematic breeding in captivity is to be found in the fact that
it is only a question of time for domestication to produce colour
variations in any kind of bird or beast. We have seen the interesting
and beautiful colours resulting from the domestication of the
Budgerigar--not to mention the financial gain of skilful and fortunate
breeders--and there is no reason to suppose that the genus Agapornis
would yield a less satisfactory return. A Blue Lovebird has already
proved a possibility.
Tavistock.
[There is almost certainly one period in the year when Lovebirds
are moulting, and when no breeding takes place, in spite of the fact that
under the unnatural conditions of captivity they may continue to breed
almost throughout the year. It should be made illegal to capture them
at any other than this non-breeding period. In some of the collections
of Lovebirds that have come over nearly all were young birds, probably
captured just after the breeding season.
We have more than once endeavoured to impress upon our members
the importance of carefully conserving the stock of foreign birds in
this country, by exchanging young birds with others to ensure fresh
blood and so forth. There would be no excuse for any of the recently

DRUMMING OF SNIPE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99732847826087" page_id="56185854"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Many people who have shot and hunted all their lives have
only come in contact with their game and quarry during winter months
and perhaps, from various reasons, have had little or no opportunity
of studying at any rate some, if not all, of their furred or feathered
victims during the breeding season ; at all events, such had been my
experience in connexion with the subject of my notes until last year.
Then while collecting moss and other materials for my aviaries,
I found myself near a well-known little stream and a favourite nesting
ground for Snipe.
I had not been there long before I heard what sounded to me like
the bleating of a lamb, and for half an hour I watched through my field
glasses a Snipe that the chauffeur had at once located and pointed out
to me.
A week later I went again to listen and observe with like results.
This year, on 5th April, I went again to the same locality, hoping
to renew my observations, but fearing I might be too early, as last
year my first visit was three weeks later. Much to my surprise and
pleasure, however, two Snipe got up in a rough grass field adjoining the
road, one to disappear, the other to commence its wide circling in the
air, and the bleating sound I had heard for the first time last year.
Now was my opportunity for settling in my own mind (only, be it
understood) the lifelong discussions I had so often listened to on the
subject of how this sound was produced by the Snipe.

Another good half hour's watching through field glasses and careful
listening convinced me that no sound could possibly be produced by
feather or feathers that would carry to the human ear for the distance
in space represented by the bird that was barely visible even through
glasses, and a very fair breeze blowing into the bargain.
Again I noticed that on every occasion that the bird emitted the
sound, was when it dipped in its flight, as it constantly did, and then
the wings were extended and perfectly still. What I should very much

like to know from the experience of others is :--
1. Why is this sound called drumming ?
2. How could it be produced without a sound box ?
3. Why is the sound only heard during the breeding season ?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941926230769231" page_id="56185855"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
I ask this because, although I have shot many snipe in my time,
both walking up and driven, I never once heard the sound before
last year. If it be generally agreed that the sound is confined to the
breeding season, then am I convinced that it is only the natural call
of mate to mate, and is produced internally, and not externally.
J. N. Hayley.
[The " drumming " or " bleating " of the Snipe- takes place only
on the downward flight and the sound is produced by the two lateral
tail-feathers, which are very stiff, and spread at right angles to the
line of the body. When rushing swiftly through the air in this position
the well-known sound is produced. The sound is frequently heard
during the breeding season, but has also, occasionally, been noted in
the winter.-- Ed.]

Of the large Sub-Family of American Parrots known as the Conurince
perhaps the most attractive species are those of the genus Pyrrhura.
There are over twenty of them, many of which have never been imported
alive. That represented in our colour plate is surely one of the most
beautiful of all, and the pair there figured are probably the first ever
brought home alive. They were brought home from the interior of
Brazil by Mr. Davidson for Mr. Chapman, in whose establishment I
discovered them and secured them for the Zoological Society.
The species was described by the late Dr. Sclater in the Proceedings
of the Zoological Society for 1864 , and illustrated by means of a coloured
plate by the late Joseph Wolf.

tion to an aquatic life. We will begin with those which come nearest
to the surface feeding Ducks. The first genera ( Netta , Metopiana,
Nyroca) have very short tails.
The Red-crested Pochard (Netta rufina) is about the prettiest
of its family. It is found in South-East Europe and the middle of Asia,
whence it emigrates in winter to Persia and India. A few come to
South-West Europe, particularly France, and breed there. It is rather
large, and the male has a shock of long ruddy feathers on its head ;
the neck, breast, abdomen and tail are black, the mantle brown, flanks
white, as are the shoulders. Bill, legs, and eyes are red. The female
and the male in eclipse are wholly light brown, the cheeks, front of the
neck, and the abdomen light grey.
This bird does not dive much, and does well in confinement, breeding
readily and adapting itself to the same treatment as Mallard.
The Rosy-billed Duck (Metopiana peposaca), which inhabits
the North Argentine, is like the preceding in its shape and habits,
and will readily interbreed with it. The drake's head, neck, and
breast are black with violet lights, his mantle is black, finely vermi-
culated with grey, abdomen and sides are streaked with grey and
white, sub-caudal feathers white, as is also the speculum. His bill
is pink surmounted by a Vermillion coloured tubercle, eyes red, yellow
and black legs ; he keeps this colour all the year round. The duck
is light brown with whitish underparts, bill and legs grey.
This species thrives and breeds very freely in confinement.
Pochards are much greater divers. There are three species which
are very much alike, two from North America and one, which is inter-
mediate between them, from Asia.
The Red-eyed Pochard (Nyroca valisneria) is very popular
throughout the United States under the name of " Canvas-back
It lives in West Canada ; a rather large bird, with very long bill and
neck. The head and neck of the male are bright red, the front of the
breast and the tail are black, the remainder a very light grey, finely
vermiculated with dark grey, the bill is wholly black, eye red, feet
black. The female has a light brown head, neck, breast, and tail
the rest of the body is pale brownish grey.
The Common Pochard (N. ferina) is widely spread over Europe

and Asia, differs from the preceding by its shorter bill which has a
grey stripe down the middle, its compact shape and a wider black band
across the breast which extends over the back ; the grey parts are not
so light. The female is darker.
The Red-headed Pochard (N. americana), also an inhabitant of
North America, where it is called the 44 Red-Head ", is less stoutly
built, it has a rounder head and is redder than the foregoing ; it has, too,
a shorter bill and grey with a black terminal spot and another white
sub-terminal. Its eyes are yellow, the black extends further over the
back, sides, and breast, and the grey mantle and upper parts are darker.
The female is far more uniformly grey and duller.
All these three Pochards do very well in confinement, and are free
breeders given sufficient water and room. The two American species
were only introduced into Europe a few years ago, but have greatly
increased. The males in summer go into partial eclipse, merely a duller
form of their handsome breeding plumage.
The Tufted Duck ( N. fuligula) is found in nearly all Europe and
Asia, migrating south in winter to North Africa and the Nile Valley.
The male is adorned with a slight crest on his nape which is merely
indicated in the female. His head, neck, breast and upper part of the
back are metallic black, mantle and tail are brownish black ; speculum
white, sides and abdomen pure white, bill and feet blue grey, eye yellow.
The female and the male when in eclipse are dull brown, with white
round the beak, on the speculum and abdomen.
This handsome Duck thrives in confinement and breeds freely
if provided with sufficient water.
The Collared Duck (N . collaris) of North America, is more like
the Pochards ; it has no crest, only a few long feathers on the crown
of its head. It differs from the Tufted Duck also in having light grey
sides, bordered by a white line, and its beak has a white and black
spot at the tip. Although fairly easy to keep in confinement, it has not
yet been brought to Europe.
The White-eyed or Ferruginous Duck (N . nyroca) is found in
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, migrating in winter to South Europe
and North Africa, Asia Minor, Persia and India. It is smaller than the
preceding, chocolate brown washed violet, darker on the back and lighter

beneath with white eyes. The bills, feet, and speculum grey; sub-caudal
white. The female is distinguished by having brown eyes. The male
in summer becomes rather duller.
This little Diver does very well in confinement, but it is sometimes
rather difficult to rear the young.
There are several species of Diving Ducks, all much alike. N. haeri,
East Asia, with green head and neck, has been imported. N. innotata,
Madagascar, has a purple head. N. australis, Australia, New Zealand,
and New Caledonia, with brown body and purple head and neck.
N. erythmphthalma, South and South-East Africa and North-West
South America, very dark, breast, abdomen and tail dark brown, almost
black, head and neck black with purple lights. Only one specimen
has been imported.
The Scaup are stouter and shorter than the Pochards, and are marine
species. They are less easy to keep and to rear but do well where they
have natural ponds.
The Common Scaup ( Fuligula marila) is widely distributed through-
out Europe, Asia, and North America, and winters in North Africa.
About the size of a Pochard, it has a dark green head, black neck,
breast and tail, pale grey mantle vermiculated with black, sides and
abdomen pure white ; yellow eyes, grey feet and bill. The female
is brown striped above with grey, breast and abdomen marked with
white, and a white band round the bill.
The Lesser Scaup (F. affinis), of North America, is decidedly
smaller ; its head has purple reflections and besides differs from the
above in having its sides finely striped with black. The female has
two white spots on either side of her bill. It has recently been imported
into Europe and has interbred with the Common Scaup.
F. novce-zelandice, which is extremely rare, approaches the Scaups.
The male is known by his black-brown mantle and dark russet under-
parts. The species has never been imported.
The Steamer Duck (Tachyeres cinereus) is a curious bird found
off the coast of South Chili, Patagonia and the adjacent islands. It owes
its name to its habit of running over the surface of the water with great
rapidity flapping its wings. It is about the size of our large domestic
kinds and is almost,-sometimes quite, incapable of flying ; ashy grey,

or brownish according to individuals, with white marks on the head,
abdomen, and wings ; bill and feet brownish yellow. The grey form
is the larger and does not fly, the brown is smaller and can fly. The
female is smaller and has throat and breast tinged with russet. This
is an interesting bird and might well be established here. It is rarely
imported, but is at present represented in the London Zoological
Gardens.
The next three have shorter bills, longer bodies and tails than
the foregoing, and are even more aquatic, feeding on molluscs and
crustaceans. Once acclimatized, they live well on natural sheets of
water if given animal food, but to rear and acclimatize them requires
great care.
The Golden-eye (Clangula clangula) is found throughout the
Northern Hemisphere. The male has a metallic green head with a white
spot on either side of the bill; back, wings and tail are black with white
marks ; all the rest of the plumage is white ; bill dark grey or black,
eye yellow, feet orange. The female and the male in eclipse are grey
with brown stripes and white abdomen.
The Iceland Duck (C. islandica) inhabits Iceland, Greenland and
the west coast of North America. It is stouter than the first named,
and has a blue-black head, crescent shaped mark at the base of the bill,
and a black mantle with white spots. Mr. Wormald has reared this
species from eggs sent from Iceland. It is a very fine bird and very
hardy when acclimatized.
The Buffel-headed Duck (C. albeola) is smaller and confined to
North America. Its head is adorned with long bushy feathers, white
at the tips, black at the base and in front. Wings and back are mingled
black and white, the rest white. The female and male in eclipse
resemble the Golden-eye, but have white chins and two white patches
behind the eyes. It has bred in confinement in America, but has not
reached Europe alive.
The Longtailed Duck (0. hiemalis) is found throughout the coasts
of the Northern Hemisphere, and frequents the most southerly parts.
It has a long, pointed tail; the male is white in winter with the sides
of the head, neck, breast, middle of the back, wings and tail dark brown,
bill black and pink, feet black ; in summer the top of his head, hie chin,

throat, neck, breast, wings, and tail are brown ; the sides of the head,
flanks, and belly white ; the feathers of the mantle are brown edged
fawn. The female has back and wings brown and the rest of her
colouring is white tinged brown on the head, breast, and tail; in summer
the brown prevails, but the sides of the head and round the eyes are
white.
This is a very abundant bird ; it is noisy and amusing to watch. It
has often been reared in confinement from eggs taken out of the
nests, but up to date it has always been short lived.
The Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) inhabits parts of
North America, Greenland, Iceland, and North-East Asia. The male
is a very beautiful slaty grey bird, having curious white marks
surrounded by black and ruddy ones on the sides and head. Both the
male in eclipse and the female are brown with white patches on the
head. It is rather uncommon, has sometimes been reared from eggs
collected in Iceland, but it proved very delicate.
The Scoters (CEdemia) are maritime Ducks whose males are black
with bills adorned either with tubercles or coloured skin. They live
on molluscs and are difficult to keep alive in confinement. There are
six species which may be briefly enumerated. The Common Scoter
( 0 . nigra), with yellow marks on the bill, inhabits Europe and Asia ;
its place is taken in America by 0 . n. americana, a closely related form.
The Velvet Scoter ( 0 . fusca), black with brown, light and orange
bill, a white patch under the eye and white speculum, inhabiting
Europe and Asia ; it is represented in America by 0 . deglandi and in
China by 0 . stejnegeri.
The Spectacled Scoter ( 0 . perspicillata) extends over the whole
Northern Hemisphere, it has a white, red, and black bill, a white spot
on the nape, and another on the centre of the head.
The Eider ( Somateria mollissima) is found on almost all shores
of the Northern Hemisphere, and breeds more particularly in the
North of Iceland, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway,
Canada, etc.
The adult male has back and breast creamy white, wings, rump,
tail, abdomen, and crown of the head black ; the nape is a pretty pale
green; the females and males in eclipse brown with black streaks.

<bodyText confidence="0.982564677419355" page_id="56185876"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
The males acquire adult plumage at three years old. In most places
the Eider is practically domesticated, and is exploited for its down and
eggs. Although their natural food is molluscan, Eiders can be reared
and kept in confinement if given running water, and will do well on
soft food and even grain.
The other Eiders, Somateria spectabilis , Heniconetta stelleri, and
Arctonetta fischeri, all have their abode in the extreme north and have
never been imported.
The genus Erismatum contains peculiar little Ducks with long
pointed tails often spread out, in whose plumage ruddy tints predominate.
There are many species, but one only from North America (E. jamai-
censis) has been kept in confinement in its own country. The European
species (E. leucocephaia) which is found in the Mediterranean basin
and Western Asia, has never been kept in confinement. We can only
enumerate here the other species : E . maccoa from South and East
Africa ; E. australis from South Australia ; E. vittata from the Argen-
tine ; E.ferruginea from Peru ; Thalassornis of Africa and Madagascar ;
Nomonyx of Central America.
The strange Musk Duck (Biziura lobata) of Australia is connected
with the above named. It is dark grey streaked with greyish white and
red brown breast, a black membrane hangs beneath the bill.
It has several times been imported, and is not very delicate ; it
appears to be rather quarrelsome.
We have not space to do more than mention the curious little
river Ducks ( Merganetta ) of the Andes ; they have narrow bills, and
long tails, red, white, and black plumage mingled, in the males, with
brown and russet; the females are grey above and ruddy beneath.
The various species do not differ much. They have never been imported.
The Salvadorina waigiulensis of New Guinea and Hymenolcemus
malacorhynchus of New Zealand are two scarce species which belong
to this family.

do fairly well if given water and unlimited fish ; they can also be trained
to take soft food and meat. But most amateurs find them difficult
to keep on account of their requirements.
The Smew (Mergus albellus) is a pretty little white bird banded
with black. Both male and female are brown and white. It inhabits
Europe and Asia, and is delightful in confinement.
The Hooded Merganser (M. cucullatus) from North America
is another handsome species. Its plumage is a mixture of white, black,
and chestnut, and it has a wide white crest bordered with black.
The Goosander (Mergus merganser) is large. The male is white
tinted fawn, except the mantle, which is grey ; the tail and abdomen
grey, the head, which has no crest, and the neck, are metallic
green. The female has a chestnut crest and white chin, the body is
grey above, tawny beneath. In eclipse the male is like the female.
The bill and feet are red.
This species lives quite well in confinement. It is found in the
Northern Hemisphere.
The Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus senator) inhabits the
same locality as the former. The females are practically alike, but the
male has a thick crest and is reddish streaked with black on the upper
part of his neck. It appears to be rather more delicate in confinement.
There are besides three very rare Mergansers : Mergus squamatus
of China, M. australis of Auckland Island, and M. brasilianus of Brazil.

measures their worth by " filthy lucre ", and how fond we are of valuing

they are worth ten times that sum, nay a hundred times to me for the
memories they bring back, not of a stuffy dealer's shop, of cages of
tiny mites straggling against dirt, foul air, bad food, and lack of sunshine,
for life. No, when I sit and watch them building their wonderful nests
or singing their harsh song my mind goes back to far- off happy days,
to a fair coral island set like a jewel in a translucent turquoise sea,
of palms mirrored in the blue lagoons, of breezes laden with heavy
tropical perfumes, of radiant tropical nights and cloudless days, of a
tiny ancient city of dazzling white and faded pink, of the crowds of
golden Weavers with their incessant din, nesting in the main avenues,
and of my seven little birds which were brought to me in a strong
but artistic wicker cage together with dozens of other feathered jewels,
rare Weavers, Whydahs, Waxbills, etc.; lovely birds never before
brought to these shores--but of all the gaudy throng, alas, but few
remained when months afterwards the ship touched the grey shores
of England. Of the others, some escaped, they were the most fortunate,
though some with weakened powers of flight found a watery grave.
Then there was the ship's cat; some of the rarest got stolen by natives
at the various ports en route ; the cage collapsed and some fell sick
and died, others reached home but the long long journey had been
too much for their frail little bodies and they " passed on ", But oh !
the love and care that was bestowed upon them. Every morning I was
up at five o'clock, many times after a &lt;c farewell party ", with aching
head and weary limbs ; at midnight in the midst of a storm with waves
mountains high and the ship heaving from side to side until we thought
each moment was our last--through it all I kept my vigil, so do you
wonder that I value my birds beyond pounds, shillings, and pence ?
Of my Weavers there were six hens and one cock, though some of
the supposed hens may have been cocks in juvenile plumage, but only
three reached here alive ; the other escaped and flew to the mainland.
They were strong winged, and I am happy to say they did not find a
watery grave. My beautiful little male escaped too, but he flew into
the engine room, and as we endeavoured to capture him he flew lower
and lower into the great maze of machinery until at last we lost him
and I came np out of the thick hot atmosphere convinced that I should
never see him again. In vain I offered rewards to the native stokers.

but a week passed and on the seventh day a native stoker handed me
as I thought a bit of dirty engine rag--it was my Weaver, filthy and
discoloured beyond recognition, just a bundle of greasy, oily feathers
but still alive. How he had lived for a week in that atmosphere without
food is to me a profound mystery : he recovered, but no amount of
washing would cleanse his oily garb, only the moult did that.
For the best part of a year the birds lived in a large outdoor aviary,
but one hen was killed by a rat. During the time they were outside
they made no attempt at nesting, and when the winter came on I
placed them in an aviary in my bird-room, which is kept at an even
temperature of 60* F. It was not a large aviary, about 6 X 6 X
8 ft. high with a sloping roof. It contained amongst others a Barbet,
a Superb Glossy Starling, and some other Weavers.
As soon as the birds got settled down they started to nest. First
of all they commenced to strip the bark from the branches and build
the nucleus of a nest, so I supplied them with hay, but this they never
found very satisfactory, it was too dry and brittle. What they wanted
was fresh grass and tough leaves, but I was at a loss to get supplies
of these in mid-winter, so I hit on the plan of supplying aspidistra
leaves as there were a good many in the greenhouse where they had been
banished from other quarters. They were just what the birds had been
waiting for, and almost before I had finished fastening the leaves in
the aviary the birds commenced stripping them. They first made a
small cut at the base of the leaf, then holding the edge of the leaf
above the cut they flew away, thus tearing a narrow strip about J X 12
inches long. This they would weave the nest of, repeating the process
until only the midrib of the leaf was left.
Very many nests were made, all of them of the most beautiful
construction. The hen would weave from the inside and the cock from
the outside. The nests were like baskets. They were much better
made than the nests of any other Weavers I have ever seen, and it was
hard to convince strangers that they were not the work of human hands.
Sometimes if the birds thought that one branch was not strong enough
to carry a nest they would draw several together and fasten them in
the most ingenuous and skilful way possible. Most of the nests were
built from the fronds of a dead palm which I placed in the aviary. The

nest which contained the eggs seemed of an even stronger construction
than the others, and the entrance hole was lengthened into a kind
of tube.
The energy of the male was amazing. From light until dark he was
in a state of perpetual motion, and he hardly ever ceased from singing
his harsh rasping song. He would hang on to the underside of the nest,
which was pouch-shaped with the entrance underneath, and with rapidly
beating wings and his head in the nest, sing to his uttermost power.
Many eggs were laid, but unfortunately they all disappeared.
I found out, but not until afterward, that this was the work of the Barbet.
The eggs were eliptical in shape, rather large for the size of the bird,
of a pinky white ground colour profusely spotted with a deeper brownish
pink. At last one egg only was laid which seemed excessively large,
this was incubated from 29th May to 8th June, on which day the young
one hatched. The mother was most assiduous in her task of feeding
the youngster. When mealworms were thrown into the aviary the
hen would be down in a flash and before the other birds realized what
was happening she would be up at the nest with a dozen or so in her
beak and upon these and soft food and small insects which she procured
from a large tray of earth which was placed in the aviary each day
the young one was fed.
All the other birds were kept from the vicinity of the nest by the
male bird, who was exceedingly pugnacious.
All went well until one day I noticed the Barbet with some large
object in its beak. It was the young Weaver, and needless to say
quite dead. After this the parents seemed to lose heart, and even though
they built many nests they never laid again.
In colour the male is chiefly bright golden yellow, the head and
face being intense dark brown, the back and u wing being dark olive
with each feather broadly edged with golden yellow, the tail brownish
olive, the beak black, and the iris of the eye bright ruby red. The hen
is larger than the cock, and she seems to have a seasonal change,
whereas the cock has none, for one part of the year she is greyish,
the back, tail, and wing olive edged with pale yellow. In the breeding
season the plumage gradually changes to a bright yellow nearly as
bright as that of the male.

On the islands of the Indian Ocean off the East African coast where
this bird lives, the nesting trees present a most remarkable sight.
Thousands of pairs of birds will use the one tree which is almost denuded
of leaves and hung with thousands of nests. The noise made by the
birds singing is perfectly deafening, and the ground underneath has
the appearance of a basket stall in a native market, for nests lie three
or four deep for a radius of about twenty feet from the trank.
This bird city is one of the most animated sights I have ever seen
in Nature. The hundreds of birds flying to and fro with nesting material
the others weaving, fighting, mating, and feeding their young produce
a sense of utter amazement on one who is used to thinking of the breeding
of birds as a very quiet and secretive business.
The largest nesting tree I ever saw was one at the end of the street
in a small town where the traffic, such as it was, did not seem to bother
the birds in the least.

JUNGLE-FOWL

As a rule Jungle-fowl are not very popular with aviculturists,
partly owing to the difficulty in obtaining living birds, and partly no
doubt owing to the fact that they are too much like domestic bantams ;
but of the four species the only one that closely resembles any one of the
domestic breeds is the Bed or Bankiva Jungle-fowl, which is the species
from which all of the domestic breeds of fowls have been derived. It
is difficult to obtain pure-bred examples of this bird, as it crosses so
very readily with the domestic breeds, and I am told that even the
wild birds are not always free from domestic blood. The crow of the
cock is identical with that of its tame descendants.
The three remaining species are very distinct, although bearing a
certain family likeness. The cocks in all three are very handsome, and
to my mind they are some of the most attractive of the Game-birds.
The Grey or Sonnerat's Jungle-fowl (Galius sonnerati ), of Southern
India, is a very beautiful bird, the cock's hackles being decorated with
spots which appear to be formed of sealing-wax. The crow of the cock
is peculiar, and has been described by Davidson as resembling " KucJc-

kaya-kya-kuk ", ending with a low double syllable like " Kyukun
kyukun ".
Sonnerat's Jungle-fowl has been bred in the London Zoological
Gardens on several occasions.
The Green or Javan Jungle-fowl (G. varius) is another remarkably
handsome species of which the cocks are from time to time imported,
but hens very rarely. The cock is peculiar in possessing an unserrated
comb, green and red in colour, a single median wattle of red, yellow
and blue, and square instead of pointed hackles. In 1877 and the two
following years this species bred in the London Zoo. Hybrids with the
Bed Jungle-fowl have been produced freely in recent years, but they
proved to be unfertile inter se.
The crow of G. varius is described by Beebe as " a high, shrill,
metallic explosion, chaw-aw-awk ". The only pair of these birds now
in this country are in Mr. Spedan Lewis's collection, and it is much to
be hoped that these will rear young.
But it is of the Ceylon Jungle-fowl (G. lafayettei) that I set out to
write, for a pair recently added to the collection are the first we have
had since 1887--more than forty years ago. I have been trying to obtain
examples for nearly a score of years, and have only recently succeeded,
thanks to the efforts and generosity of Mr. Walter Shakspeare, who,
after several attempts, got home two pairs and presented them to the
Society. One pair were apparently weakened by the voyage and died
soon after their arrival, but the remaining pair have done well.
This is another very beautiful species, the cock being readily
distinguished from that of the Red Jungle-fowl by his orange-red
instead of black breast, golden hackles, red comb with yellow patch
in the centre, and violet patch on the throat.
The hen is not easily described, but is entirely unlike the Red
Jungle-hen or any of its domestic relations, and may be briefly described
as brown, very mottled, especially on the underparts with white ; the
tail mostly rufous, and the wings barred with black, white, and
chestnut.
This species is confined to Ceylon, and is fairly generally distributed
in suitable localities, but very few birds are ever exported alive from
that island, which perhaps accounts for the Jungle-fowl being

unobtainable over here. A few attempts have been made to keep it in
captivity in its own country, and there hybrids have been produced
with domestic fowls. These have proved to be not entirely sterile when
bred inter se, but the percentage of fertility, according to Beebe, has
been exceedingly low, and of the eggs produced, about one hundred
in one year, only two chicks were hatched. Jungle-hens, we are told,
have never laid in captivity in Ceylon.
When our pair arrived the cock was already fairly tame, but the
hen was decidedly otherwise, though she rapidly improved. The cock
soon commenced to utter his crow of Cluck-George-Joyce, or, as Mr. Finn
interprets it, Up-George-Rex, and when the pair had been in the Gardens
only two months a nest containing two eggs was discovered behind
some brushwood in one corner of the aviary. The following two days
added two more eggs, and the next day, after laying her fifth egg, the
little hen commenced to sit, and we are looking forward to the hatching
of a brood very soon.
The Ceylon Jungle-fowl was bred in the London Zoological Gardens
in 1874, in the good old days when the Gardens were sparsely populated
and contained but few buildings and there were quiet enclosures to which
only a few favoured individuals had access. The breeding of rare game-
birds was then a comparatively easy matter, and there was plenty of
fresh ground on which to rear the chicks, which, unfortunately, is not
the case nowadays. But in spite of the changed conditions, we hope
for success with the Ceylon Jungle-fowl.

and to raise the young. They are much interested in what will be

of their own age. These are the first albino Canadas to be bred in
domesticity, so far as I know. Neither of the brothers take credit
for breeding these pure white Canadas, but they have a natural pride
in them ; also in their breeding of many hundreds of brown-eared or
Manchurian Pheasants. In fact, they alone have supplied United States
of America and Canada with this variety. They have also bred many

A SAILOR'S PETS

<bodyText confidence="0.985538888888889" page_id="56185886"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In this district there lives a sailor who appears to possess
an unusual gift for taming and training wild and domestic birds. Some
years ago he attracted my attention by walking along the busy streets
of the town with a cock, who required but little persuasion to accompany
his master for a promenade the conditions of which would have reduced
an ordinary fowl to screaming hysterics. Later I heard that the sailor
had become the owner of a Crane which also joined him in his walks.
Though interested, I was not particularly surprised, as Cranes are
readily tamed and a single bird will show for a human friend the same
sociable attachment which in a wild state it would display towards
its mate.
I was not, however, able to see the bird until last week, when I
happened to pass the sailor and his pets. He was standing with several
other men in an open space in the middle of a busy country town.
A short distance from him a small domestic or possibly half-bred Wild
Duck was resting as contentedly as though she were on the bank of a
pond, and not far from the duck was standing, in an equally composed
frame of mind, not a Crane, but a Common Heron. To render a Heron

utterly fearless of humanity may not be a very difficult task, but to
induce that solitary and meditative bird to stroll along a busy thorough-
fare and stand about in a market place is surely a remarkable feat.
I am not a little puzzled either to understand how the sailor manages
to protect his pets from constant molestation by passing dogs.

Sir, --It is, as you say, likely that there is a non-breeding season
when Lovebirds are in moult, although at the time of writing some
of my adult Fischers, imported at the same time and kept in the same
aviary, are breeding, while others are resting and moulting. It would
be interesting to know whether the newly imported lots observed
to consist almost entirely of young birds were of more than one
species ? There would be a reason for the trappers selecting only
immature Masked, as the adults fight so savagely that it is difficult
to keep a remunerative percentage alive. But is this desirable selection
of young birds also made in the case of the more amiable species,
where no financial interest is involved ?

Only by keeping fewer birds, at greater expense and in more unsightly
quarters, can the mortality from chill and egg-binding be much
reduced. If you keep only a few pairs in smaller aviaries--preferably
movable--shut them up in the shelter at night; warm the shelter
during inclement weather at all times of the year ; oblige the hens
to nest in the shelters only and give them gin and glycerine in the
drinking-water, and, if necessary, extra heat when they appear about to
lay, you may cut down your losses, but few people think it worth while
to go to so much trouble for cheap and common birds. The following are
useful tips : (1) Get a p.m. report on all birds that have not obviously
died of egg-binding or accident. If you find you are losing a large per-
centage of one species from the same complaints, it shows you must
either give up keeping it or change its environment or you will be
wasting birds and money. (2) Never leave a sick bird in the aviary
with others ; isolate it at once. If it is suffering from chill it is bound
to get worse if left in the environment that caused it to fall ill. If it
has got some infectious complaint it will be a source of danger to its
companions and foul the ground or cage worse the longer it remains.
(3) In a new lot of imported Finches some are almost sure to be a bit
plucked about the head. As long as the heads of these birds remain
bare it is a sure sign that they and their better-feathered companions
which have endured the same hardships are in a delicate state of health
and very likely to die if turned into an unheated aviary. Keep them,
therefore, in box cages provided with snug sleeping quarters and
kept in a warm room until a thick crop of quills appears on the bare
spots ; that is nature's sign that their systems are recovered from the
exhaustion of the voyage and they are then safe to turn out.

Sir,-- I read with interest Mr. Appleby's article " Notes from a

which we, as a Society, pay to the keeping of the commoner and less
expensive birds.

As Mr. Appleby says, the articles do, generally speaking, confine
themselves to rare and expensive species most of which are quite out
of the reach of the ordinary aviculturist.
Yet I feel with Mr. Appleby that articles on the keeping, feeding,
housing, and general treatment of the commoner birds are essential
to the well-being of the Society. Newcomers must be taught, and
their interest, and that of the general public, must be fostered, and
I feel that this is far more likely to be accomplished by means of
articles on birds which the average person can afford to purchase
than by those, valuable as they are, on species which are rarely
imported.
How long is it, for instance, since we had an article on the Redrump
Parrakeet ? Yet this is an excellent species for the beginner, and
a complete account of its feeding, breeding, and general management
would, I think, prove both interesting and instructive to many of
our members--because the bird is within their reach.
By means of such accounts members' interests would be extended
to species of which at present they may fight shy owing to lack of
knowledge.
Why do we hesitate to send in such articles ? Is it the fear that
" my " few birds are too poor to interest anyone but myself ? If so
we are wrong. An account of everyone's birds would interest some-
one, and it is by this means that we further the objects of the Society,
help one another enlarge the Magazine, and, by allowing such articles
to be judiciously intermixed with others, none the less interesting and
instructive though more advanced, make it more interesting for the
majority of our members.
There is one point which might prove useful to Mr. Appleby (and
perhaps other members), and which if adopted will prevent a recurrence
of the unfortunate accident to his Golden-breasted Waxbill. When
I removed to my present address 18 months ago I extended my aviary
accommodation and was very badly troubled with cats. I endured
it all last summer, and in the autumn I decided to put a stop to it.
I obtained some 2 in. by 2 in. quartering and cut it into 2 J in. pieces.
These I nailed all over the top of my 20 ft. by 12 ft. aviary flight,
at intervals of 4 feet, and across them stretched tightly 2 in. mesh

wire netting. I have not been troubled with cats since as the mesh
is too large for them to walk on and a 4 in. overhang all round prevents
them climbing up the sides.
If they should get on top they will have to move too slowly for
them to be able to do any damage. The arrangement is scarcely
noticeable from the ground. If the blocks are drilled before being
sawn off they will not split when nailed on the flight.

Sir, --About a week ago I took a young Masked Lovebird to hand-
rear as a pet. It was fairly well feathered on the head and wings, but
the rest of the body wasmostly in down or quills.
It is a strangely alert, grown-up little bird for its age. At first it was
excessively shy, and for more than two days it ate practically nothing,
hiding in the flannel in its basket and refusing my repeated offers of
food. Towards the end of the third day it began to eat brown bread,
and on the fifth day spray millet, and would have maintained itself
entirely on that seed if I had not obliged it to take other food from me
to retain its confidence. It is extremely fond of porridge, and without
any suggestion or encouragement from us insists, whenever possible,
on being fed from our mouths instead of from our hands. The fact that
it clearly realizes that a human mouth is a mouth suggests the rather

Masked Lovebirds !
It already discriminates between strangers and people it knows,
and hides in its basket on the appearance of the former, climbing up
the side and tumbling in if it happens to be out of its home.
I have turned the parents loose, and so far they are staying well.

By Denys Weston, F.Z.S.
Our Editor has had many requests for articles upon common birds,
and no variety can answer this description better than the Budgerigar.
To describe this bird would be superfluous after we have
admired the beautiful coloured plate by Mr. Roland Green which
accompanies this article.
The subject of this essay is extremely hardy, easy to breed, and
requires little attention.
Budgerigars can be kept either in a cage or aviary, indoors or out,
but they undoubtedly thrive better in a large garden aviary. The
design of their home must, of course, depend upon the length of one's
purse or accommodation, but two warnings are necessary. The wire
netting should be beyond reproach, many deaths having occurred
through birds biting off lumps of soft solder. The second danger is
lack of shelter from the sun. Some protection must be given against
*direct rays, or fits and paralysis will be caused by sunstroke. If glass
is used, either in cage or aviary, it should be covered by netting, or the
birds will endeavour to fly through it. I can, from personal experience,
recommend " Yitaglass " which admits the ultra-violet rays, and

costs little more than ordinary glass. It is scarcely necessary to add
that this should never be used in a room which has other windows
through which the source of light has already been filtered by ordinary
glass.
The cock Budgerigar is easily distinguished when adult by the
cere or fleshy substance above the beak, this being purple whereas in
hens it varies from pale blue to deep brown. This latter condition is
erroneously described as " breeding condition ". In my opinion,
the deeper shade of brown a hen's cere is, the nearer she is to going
out of condition. I have only seen hens eggbound in this condition .
never with either a pale blue or light brown coloration.
The young are rather harder to sex by the tyro, as the cere in both
sexes appears blue. Closer inspection will reveal a deep purple-pink
tint under the outer skin in the cock, whereas that of the hen is of a
pale buff shade.
Food can consist of a staple diet of canary seed 1 part, Italian
white millet 1 part, Indian millet J part. Pintail groats can be supplied
as an extra when feeding young or in cold weather. Cuttlefish, old
mortar, and sea sand should be supplied as grit. The sea sand should
be about the coarseness of Demerara sugar. Water is necessary.
Although they seldom bathe they appreciate a shower or a roll in
wet turf.
A warning is necessary when discussing green food. This should
never be supplied in a frost-bitten condition, or diarrhoea will follow.
I use lettuce all the year round, keeping a whole lettuce in water for
them to peck at. Chickweed, groundsel, dandelion, and all seeding
grasses are appreciated. Rye-grass (perennial rye) and green oats
are specially valuable food. My birds rave over the latter, and the
young always leave the nest a week earlier when these are in season.
It should be remembered that green food contains little carbohydrate,
and should be used freely if hens are too fat. Naturally, if their crop
is half full of green food, they eat less corn.
The Budgerigar is undoubtedly the most prolific foreign bird in
captivity, but we must remember that they are gregarious, and that
is why a pair, kept alone, will usually refuse to nest.
I have never been successful in breeding in cages, but know plenty

of breeders who do so. Undoubtedly an outdoor aviary is the ideal
method.
Budgerigars build no nest but simply scrape out a cocoanut husk,
or use the concave bottom of a wooden box to lay in. I prefer a wooden
nest as it is easier both to clean and inspect. Nests should be hung
about 5 ft. 6 in. high, facing the light. The birds also soon destroy
husks.
The most suitable nesting boxes are formed of J inch wood,
outside measurements being 7J inches high by 5 inches square. The
bottom is formed of 1|- inch wood which is hollowed out to form a
concave receptacle for the actual egg-chamber. The entrance hole
is 1J inches in diameter, the top of the hole being about one inch
from the top. Just below the entrance hole a short perch is inserted.
The top of the box should be hinged for inspection and cleaning,
and a strong wire loop at the back serves for hanging the box to a nail.
Care should be taken to see that the bottom of the box is thick.
The commercial article usually purchased is useless without an extra
piece of wood, as the birds soon scratch a hole through the bottom,
and the eggs chill from underneath, causing dead, in shell.
Overcrowding should be avoided during the breeding season, and
two or three nesting receptacles provided for each pair or fighting will
be experienced.
Avoid an odd hen like the plague when breeding. Actuated by
jealousy she will do incalculable damage to other hens, eggs, and young.
April is quite soon enough to put the nest boxes up, and the first
egg should be laid about the eighth day if birds are in condition. In
fact it is useless pairing birds until they are fit, or eggbinding, delicate
young, etc., will be the result. Eggs are laid on alternate days, until
the clutch of five or six is complete. Incubation commences from the
first egg, and lasts 17 days. The young require no special soft food,
nature supplying the parents with a yellow fluid which is pumped
into the crop after the manner of pigeons. This " pigeon's milk "
becomes coarser until the young are weaned. They leave the nest,
fully feathered, at about a month old, and quickly fend for themselves.
Breeding should be stopped by removing the nests about October,
or the parents' vitality will be sapped, and the young delicate.

148 G. H. Gurney--Some Notes on Egyptian Birds in Giza
Trouble need not be experienced if good robust stock be purchased.
Fits, enteritis, and eggbinding are the most likely sicknesses to be
encountered. Enteritis can be cured if taken in time, by filling the
mouth with powdered bismuth carbonate and keeping the bird warm.
This should be administered twice daily. Provided plenty of grit and
cuttlefish is available, and the birds are fit and take plenty of exercise,
eggbinding should not occur. First season hens are usually the victims,
and the third egg seems the most critical time. The patient should be
put in a small cage, in front of a hot fire, when the egg will usually be
laid. If not forthcoming, and the egg can be felt, and the bird is
obviously dying, I usually adopt a method advised by my friend
Mr. Miles of Norwich Canary fame. This consists of holding the bird
firmly with one hand, and squeezing the egg with the other towards
the vent, until it is broken, and then expelled. This is a desperate
remedy, but has never failed with me.
Young birds are usually very mischievous, and should be separated
from their parents when able to fend for themselves. If allowed to
remain, they will soon go to nest and ruin their constitutions. I have
always emphasized that no Budgerigar should be allowed to nest
until twelve months old.
I have never experienced " French moult This either takes
the form of curly feathers or lack of flight and/or tail feathers. It is
very prevalent, and, in my opinion, nothing more than debility caused
by inbreeding, overbreeding, or immature stock. For this reason I
have not referred to it under my paragraph on diseases. The remedy
is obvious.
With the kind permission of the Editor, I shall deal with
colour production in a future issue.

sunshine. I am afraid the paper must necessarily be more ornithological
than purely avicultixrah
Egypt, as everyone knows, rejoices in a perfect winter climate,
rain is almost unknown, and each succeeding day is hot and cloudless ;
its splendid monuments and wonderful tombs and temples are unrivalled
among the marvels of the world. The scenery, too, is unique in its way,
the golden desert stretching away on either side, the arid rocky wadis
or ravines, the broad shining Nile flowing placidly between wide
strips of brilliant green cultivation, the groups of waving palms, and
the shady lebek trees, combine to form pictures of never ending beauty.
The population, too, is at once intensely interesting and picturesque,
for the Egyptian felaheen of to-day have much the same customs and
habits as their ancestors in the times of the ancient Pharaohs. The
shadouf and the zakeyeh (water-wheel) still groan on the river banks,
the women still winnow com in the wind and grind it in stone mills,
fish are caught in the same kind of nets, and birds are snared in the
same shaped traps as in the days of Seti and Eameses the Great. To
the ornithologist Egypt is one of the most interesting countries he
can visit; the Nile valley has been from time immemorial one of the
great migration routes for birds of all descriptions, which in early
spring, or returning in the autumn, pass in myriads up the course
of the river. When we were at Mena at the end of March, and during
the first week in April, we came in for the height of the northward
spring migration, and an intensely interesting experience it was. The
hotel garden would be full one day of some species, Wrynecks for
instance, and the following day there would be hardly one to be seen,
they had all passed on. Immense flocks of migrating Wagtails, Finches,
and many other small species would be seen passing overhead, and such
birds as Merlins, Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters, and Cuckoos would pass
over, or be seen resting in some grove of trees, only to be gone next
day. But the subject of bird migration.in Egypt is of much too wide
a character to be more than touched on here. I was also tremendously
interested in the numberless paintings and drawings of birds done by
the ancient Egyptians in the temples and tombs, many of them drawn
four and five thousand years ago, and depicted in the most life-like
way, so that it is easy to recognize birds and animals which were common

in the land in those remote ages, as the predecessors of the identical
species which one sees in the same localities to-day. Among some
of the more interesting ones, is an undoubted portrait of two Bed-
breasted Geese, they are half the size of life, and are painted with
White-fronted Geese upon a stone slab found at Meydoun; they
are supposed to be older than the Pyramids themselves, and are extra-
ordinarily life-like. 1 On the walls of some of the tombs at Sakkara
are wonderful drawings of Cranes, being fed by hand, no doubt birds
which were being kept in captivity, and fattened until they were
plump enough to be killed for the Pharaoh's table ; while on a tomb
at Beni-Hassan it is easy to make out the Spoonbill, Barn Owl, the
Masked Shrike, and others. I also saw wonderful drawings of the
Night Heron, Pintail Duck, Buddy Shelduck, Hoopoe, Avocat, Dove,
Pelican, Ostrich, and Sacred Ibis. With regard to this latter bird,
Ibis cethiopica, much has been written ; it will always remain a vexed
question why this particular species should have been made by the
ancient Egyptians one of the objects of their worship, and venerated
to a tremendous degree. I believe it was Plutarch who gave the three
following reasons, viz. that its black and white plumage resembled the
colour of the moon and the surrounding sky at night, that the space
between its legs resembled an equilateral triangle, and that it was
supposed to make a medicinal use of its beak, but Plutarch is notorious
for his plausibility. It was always supposed that the Sacred Ibis was,
in ancient times, a very common Egyptian bird, but it was probably
never a common wild bird, in fact, I. consider that it must always
have been a rarity, and that they were imported from the south, else
why should they have become extinct if they were ever natives ?
They were probably domesticated, became totally dependent on man,
and when Egypt was conquered by another nation, and the hand of
protection withdrawn, the breed died out. However, whether the
species was found in Egypt or not, the Sacred Ibis has always been,
and still is, the bird par excellence for the tourist to see and for the
dragoman to romance about; the ignorant and unsuspecting traveller
is shown them to-day, by unscrupulous guides, stalking about in the
fields between Cairo and Mena. I heard one loquacious dragoman

dilating on their beauty and interest to a small party of credulous
Cook's tourists, who were obviously thrilled at long last seeing the
venerable Ibis of antiquity. The birds which are made to do duty
for them are, of course, Buff-backed Herons. The only other birds
sacred to the ancient Egyptians, or venerated by them in worship'
besides the Ibis were the Griffon Vulture, the Banner, the Goose, and
the Night Heron. Birds of Prey are extremely numerous in Egypt,
and the commonest is the Egyptian Kite, Milvus parasiticus. These
birds swarm nearly everywhere, and very bold and fearless they are ;
they abound in Cairo, and frequent every village, and indeed any place
where there is a chance of their obtaining offal. They had all started
to breed by 20th March, often choosing a sont-tree ; two nests which
I climbed up to had no eggs on 18th March, they were large,
untidy structures, and contained rubbish of every description, pieces
of paper, bits of rag, in fact any oddment the birds happened to notice.
Their wailing cry is not unpleasing, and I was never tired of watching
them sailing gracefully backwards and forwards over the hotel terrace.
Kestrels (Cerchneis tinnunculus ), too, abounded ; this was another
bird the ancient Egyptians made sacred, they frequent the villages
very much, building in the walls of the houses ; if we selected a bird
to deify, we might choose the House Martin, in the same way, perhaps,
the old Egyptians chose the Kestrel from its affecting the haunts of
men, the Kite would have been too much of a scavenger, the Sparrow
was too insignificant, while the Buff-backed Heron, an equally
abundant species, consorted with beasts and not with men. I saw
Egyptian Vultures, Neophron percnopterus , on a few occasions, one got
up from a dead donkey in the desert very close to me one day, a
magnificent, fully adult male, and other big Vultures and large Hawks.
w T ere often seen far off, soaring very high up in the sky, but
impossible to identify at that distance.
For several weeks I stayed at Helouan, a delightful place, some
thirty miles south of Cairo, and right on the edge of the Libyan desert.
In the hotel garden a pair of White-vented Bulbuls (Pycnonotus arsinoe)
were generally to be seen in some large tamarisk bushes ; three weeks
later this species was quite common, and singing beautifully at Mena,
and evidently about to breed. Thanks to protection in recent years

152 G. H. Gurney--Some Notes on Egyptian Birds in Giza
(there is a good Egyptian bird protection society), certain birds have
now become much commoner than when I was last in Egypt before
the war. The exquisite Little Green Bee-eater, M erops viridis, hadbecome
quite rare, owing to perpetual persecution, at Luxor boys used to catch
them alive, tie a string to one leg, which was generally broken, and
whirling them round their heads, try and sell them to tourists, in every
case the birds were nearly dead from exhaustion and fright; however,
all this has now been put a stop to, and this lovely tropical-like species
may be seen commonly, often little parties of three or four, sitting
together on the fronds of a palm leaf, one or other continually dashing
off to catch a passing insect; they are resident in Middle Egypt
throughout the year. Another lovely species of Bee-eater, which is
migratory, is the Blue-cheeked, M erops cegyptius. I first saw a small
flock of these birds on 13th March passing high overhead, and during
the following days I saw others ; curiously enough the Common
Bee-eater, M. apiaster , is the last of the family to arrive from the
South, and is not generally seen before the middle of April.
A very characteristic bird, wherever there is any water, is the Pied
Kingfisher, Ceryle nidis , their wonderful, rapid, hovering flight, as they
hang head and beak pointing downwards looking for their prey, has
often been described; if they see a fish they fall on to it like a stone,
with a resounding splash, which one would .think would frighten all
the neighbouring fish miles away. I watched many fishing, and I am
bound to say they did not appear to be very successful, but if they
missed they were up again in a moment and hovering over a different
part of the water. In Egypt, as everywhere else, the presence of water
always means interesting birds, and amongst other species which
I noted, generally near ponds or reedy marshes, were Red-spotted
Bluethroats, Cyanecuia suecica, which were often very common;
they are nearly always on the ground, and may be recognized
immediately by their tails, which they always hold straight up, yet it is
extremely difficult to get a sight of the breast spot, as they invariably
turn their backs upon you. Another most characteristic Egyptian
bird, which I often saw in the vicinity of water, was the Spur-winged
Plover, Hoplopterus spinosus , so conspicuous in their black and
grey and white plumage. They stand erect watching one, moving their

bodies with spasmodic jerks, they have a loud and varied cry, and are
altogether most attractive birds, the native name for them is " Tak-
tak balad ", they start breeding in March, but I did not find any nests.
Round the edges of the marsh one will see Green Sandpipers, Tringa
ocropus, Ruffs and Reeves, Machetes pugnax, and plenty of Kentish
Plover, Charadrius alexandrinus , and if the water is of large enough
extent many other Waders, while perhaps a Marsh Harrier, Circus
ceruginosus, will come sailing round, or a flock of Ruddy Sheld-duck,
Tadorna tadorna, fly over, and always the beautiful Oriental Chimney
Swallow, Hirundo savignii, with its purple-red breast will flit backwards
and forwards over the water. The curious Painted Snipe, Bhynchcea
capensis, are found more often in marshy fields; it is a very peculiar
bird, totally different from any other species of Snipe, having more the
appearance of a kind of Sun Bittern, it would make a most interesting
inmate for our aviaries. On several occasions I motored, or rode, far
into the desert to some of the distant Wadis ; these are absolutely arid
and rocky ravines or gorges between the hills, practically destitute of
vegetation, and where the sun's rays beat fiercely dowm until they
become veritable suntraps. What birds there are in these remote spots
are always extraordinarily interesting. The splendid form of Egyptian
Eagle Owl, Bubo ascalaphus, may be found in caves and holes in the
mountains : a pair of Brown-necked Ravens, Corvus umbrinus , will
croak mournfully at the intruder of their solitude before flapping away.
Beautiful black and white Chats (Saxicola) of different species fly
hurriedly from boulder to boulder, on the top of which they perch for
a moment to gaze at the stranger before flying off, with a flick of their
tails. Unless one handles them, it is sometimes difficult to identify the
species correctly, but they are always most showy birds, their contrasting
colours of jet black and snowy white showing up conspicuously against
.the yellow arid rocks.
A bird I was specially pleased to see in the Wadi Risheid was
Heys Rock Partridge, Ammoperdix heyii, as I had never come across
it previously in a wild state, though I had a charming pair alive some
years ago in one of the aviaries ; they are great runners, and those
I saw ran straight up the almost perpendicular side of the gorge,
jumping upwards from rock to rock. No wonder it is difficult to keep

alive in confinement, in our damp wet climate, birds which live in such
a torrid, dry spot, roasted by the blazing sun every day. Colonel
Meinertzhagen told me that a few weeks previously he had found the
species common half-way up Mount Sinai, and living right amongst
the snow, but as all aviculturalists know, some birds will stand any
amount of dry cold and die at once from damp. On the sandy bottoms
of the wadis were small flocks of that charming bird the Trumpeter
Bullfinch, Erythrospiza gitaginea ; they were rendered easier to see by
their bright red bills and pretty pink plumage, it has too a wonderfully
clear tinkling note; here again would be a most delightful bird for our
aviaries, but it is all too seldom imported. They bred in Mr. Mead-
Waldo's aviary many years ago, I believe. But perhaps the rarest
bird I identified in the Wadi Risheid was the tiny Scrub Warbler,
Scotocerca inquieta, a minute brown bird with a very long tail; it occurred
singly in some of the grey-coloured bushes which grew sparsely along
the bed of the wadi, and was very shy. This species is only known in
Egypt in the Wadi Risheid and the adjacent Wadi Hof.
Coming home across the desert, one saw a few Desert Larks
(Amomonanes), of what species I am unable to say, as I did not shoot
any, so could not identify them ; and on the more stony parts we
disturbed a pair or two of Stone Curlews, (Edicnemus senegalensis
a fine large spotted form, differing considerably from our British
species. In certain places in Egypt this species has adopted the very
remarkable habit of perching, and even breeding, on the flat roofs of
the houses. I climbed up on to the roof of a large factory at the Delta
Barrage, and on the top were no less than seventeen Stone Curlews
running about; they were quite tame, and allowed a very near approach
before flying off. It was the most remarkable sight to see a bird which
one had always considered, and previously seen, as entirely a ground
bird, living on the flat roof of a building, where there was considerable,
noise from machinery continually going on and numbers of people
passing backwards and forwards below them ; though the manager
who accompanied us on to the roof told me that no one ever went up
there, and that consequently the birds were never disturbed. He said
that in ten days time (my visit was on 4th April) they would all be
breeding on the roof. One would immensely like to know what reason &gt;

in the first instance, made them desert their natural habitat and take
to what was apparently such an unnatural mode of existence, and that,
although the desert, their true home, ran up to within a mile or so of
the houses (for there were several others there) which they were
inhabiting. It cannot be for any sense of protection, or avoiding
possible dangers, as one would imagine they were far more liable
to have many eggs taken by the swarms of Kites and Hooded Crows
which were continually flying round the houses.
The last weeks of my time in Egypt were spent at Mena, at the foot
of the mighty Pyramids; here I noted other birds which I had not seen
at Helouan. The Rock Thrush, Monticola saxalilis, and the Blue Rock
Thrush, M. cyana, both occurred. The beautiful Cretzchmar's Bunting,
Emberiza caesia, was seen near the golf links, further along the Rufous
Warbler, JEdon galactodes, appeared on 2nd April; the reed beds
surrounding some large ponds were full of very noisy Clamorous Sedge
Warblers, Acrocephalus stentoreous, and occasionally a solitary Lesser
E gret, Herodias garzetta, would be seen there too; while always innumer-
able Buff-backed Herons, Ardeola russata, dazzlingly snow-white, stalked
solemnly about in the fields, closely attending the buffaloes and
picking the gnats off their legs.
In the hotel garden, Hoopoes, IJpupa epops, had already young in
their nests by 5th April. Bulbuls, P. arsinoe, were singing blythely
from the orange-trees, and a pair of lovely little Black-headed Warblers,
.Sylvia melanocephala, were evidently about to breed in a tamarisk
hedge.
A largs company of about forty Night Herons, Nycticorax g rise us,
roosted by day in the tops of some tall acacia trees at the bottom of
the garden. One morning I heard two shots fired and saw the whole
flock of Herons flying wildly about over the tops of their trees ; going
down to investigate, I found three freshly killed birds lying underneath
the trees, which their murderer had not even troubled to pick up
after slaughtering them ; hearing from a native gardener that the
German manager of the hotel was the aggressor, this gentleman was
presently interviewed, and it was explained to him that, as he no
*doubt knew, he was breaking the law in shooting a protected bird,
*and that for no reason, such as requiring it to eat, or for a collection,

but out of sheer wanton cruelty, and it was gently indicated that it
would not look well if an account shortly appeared in the local Press
to the effect that the well-known manager of a well-known
Hotel had been summoned for thus heinously breaking the
law. This threat had the effect of immediately producing a ten pound
note from the gentleman's pocket for the Egyptian Bird Protection
Society if no more was said about the matter !
Many more rare and interesting birds were seen, including a
wonderful company of Flamingoes on Lake Menzaleh, but these notes
are already long enough, but before ending I should like to give a
very brief account of the Cairo Zoological Gardens, which are situated
at Giza, just outside the town, and are renowned as some of the best
gardens there are.
I had last visited them when they were under the control and most
able management of Messrs. Flower and Nicoll, both very fine
ornithologists, and&apos; to-day they are administered entirely by the
Egyptian Government, and the whole staff is Egyptian, the under-
keepers being Soudanese. One must not criticize, but there was a
very marked difference in the general appearance of the Zoo. The
gardens are most beautifully laid out, with wonderful flowering trees
and shrubs, plenty of open water, and groves of natural trees and
bushes which were swarming with passing migrants during the first
week of April. The number of birds and animals now in the Gardens
appeared to me to be very considerably larger than formerly, and
are a wonderful collection, mainly African types.
The larger Mammals made a very fine show, especially the splendid
series of big Antelopes, Hartebeestes, and Gazelles; the big Carnivora,
too, were very fine, and the Apes and Monkeys, of which there is a
fine representative collection, all living in outdoor wire cages, with
no shelter at all beyond a roof, and in some cases a box for the animals
to go into. There is no artificial heat of any kind in the Gardens,
except in the Reptile House, and delicate tropical birds are out the
whole year round, with nothing more than a small open shelter to go
into ; some of the aviaries containing Orioles and Rollers had not
even a real shelter. A huge flight contained a magnificent series of
African Vultures of various species, all looking in perfect condition

though against this some of the smaller Hawks (Kites and Falcons)
were badly housed in very small places and did not look well. A large
enclosure contained three Balceniceps rex, which were quite tame,
a whole flock of Large Bustards, which I supposed were Eupodotis
arahs, with various Cranes, Crested Screamers, and other birds, the
whole making a very fine display. The larger piece of ornamental
water in the middle of the Gardens was covered with Ducks, mainly
Shovellers and some Teal; these are all full-winged birds, and are
perfectly wild, and go off to their feeding grounds every night, returning
at daybreak. They know they are perfectly safe in this sanctuary,
and are very tame, and yet if one saw the same birds on a lake outside,
they would be up and away before one could get within gunshot;
otherwise the series of pinioned Ducks is very poor, and not at all
representative, though the masses of wild birds cover the water, and
fill in the picture.
The present Director, Doctor Kadri, and his assistant, Yousef
Sabit, were most courteous, giving me every facility for seeing all
I wanted to, and before I left kindly presented me with several live
birds, some Buff-backed Herons, a pair of Abyssinan Helmeted
Guineafowl, Numida ptilorhyncha, and some nice Starlings, the Beautiful
Spreo, Spreo pulcher, which in spite of its name I do not consider such
a fine species as Spreo superbus ; it is rather larger in size perhaps, and
the red of the breast, though much duller in tint than in Superhus,
extends further, the back is a very peculiar shade of dark oily green.
It is a species which is seldom imported, and will make a
nice addition to my series of Glossy Starlings. The Cairo Zoological
Gardens is not a paying concern, and this perhaps is hardly to
be wondered at, as admission to the Gardens is only Id., though a
small additional charge is made to go into the Reptile House. It was
always nicely filled with middle and lower-class native visitors, and
on Sundays was crowded, with a good sprinkling of Europeans as
well. I will conclude these notes by quoting the following rather
amusing story I was told while in Egypt: A tourist, visiting the country
for the first time, was anxious to air his then slender stock of Arabic.
Wishing to order a hot bath, he called the " boy ",and gave, as he thought,
the order in good, well-pronounced Arabic. After waiting for a very

long time, the "boy" reappeared, not with the expected bath, but
with a freshly cooked roast pigeon and a bowl of sugar, much to the
gentleman's surprise. Explanations, of course, ensued, and the waiter
proved himself to have only obeyed orders, for the gentleman had
asked for Hamdm-sukkar (pigeon, sugar) instead of for Hammam sukkn

My aviary is a lean-to affair, consisting of a wooden shelter 7 ft. by
4 ft. and a wire flight 7 ft. by 5 ft., the whole being 6 ft. 6 in. high.
The shelter is constructed of f inch matchboarding and is well
lighted by two large windows. The floor is of concrete, covered with
two or three inches of builders' sand. Round the bottom of the
interior of the shelter I have nailed about six inches of J inch mesh
wire netting, and this, together with the concrete floor, makes it, I
think, reasonably rat-proof (though it has never been called upon to
stand the test).
The flight is built over a small plum-tree, which provides all the
perching accommodation necessary outside. Inside the shelter I have,
of course, fixed up several branches. The ground space of the flight
is turfed over. I find it necessary to returf about three times a year,
as the Parrakeets are very fond of nibbling the growing shoots.
This, then, was the aviary into which I put my pair of Stanley
Parrakeets when I received them in September, 1921. They were
beautiful birds, and when adult were very similar to a small Rosella.
They very soon settled down and in a couple of months were so tame
that they would perch upon my hand and take a piece of apple from my
fingers. Needless to say I was very pleased at this, and had great
hopes of breeding from them in 1922. My hopes, however, were not
realized, for though I frequently noticed the cock feeding the hen in
May, they got no further, and I had to wait as patiently as I could
for another spring. However, this year the cock showed signs of a
desire to nest very early, for in March he began to chase the hen violently

round the aviary. At first she would have nothing to do with him,
but in April I noticed she began to accept his attentions, and later
on I frequently saw them inspecting nest boxes together.
They eventually chose an oblong box, 18 in. long by 6 in. by
6 in., with a 2 in. diameter hole in one end, and straightway began to
scrape out the sawdust which I had put in to prevent the eggs rolling
about. (I have boxes with concave bottoms now.) I was rather
surprised that they chose this box in preference to barrel nests, which
were in the aviary.
I was away from home on holiday from 1st to the 14th May, but on
the day I returned I found the hen apparently sitting very closely
in the nest box. When at last I managed to catch her off the nest.
I was very disappointed to find it empty. The next morning, however,.
I was surprised to find two eggs in the box. On the 17th there were
three, and on the 22nd four. After the third egg was laid, the hen very
rarely left the nest, so I do not know the exact date on which the-
fourth egg was laid. She never even left the nest to feed, so I conclude
the cock must have fed her all through the period of incubation.
On 7th June, twenty-three days after the first egg. was laid, I
noticed the hen off the nest, and a hurried examination showed that,
two of the eggs had hatched. A third hatched the following day, and
the fourth was infertile.
The young were lovely little things at first, for they were covered
with long white down. As they sat in the nest together they looked
just like a ball of fluff. After about a fortnight, however, pen feathers,
began to grow on the head and wings and they became ugly little things.
They grew fairly quickly, but did not feather as fast as I expected, and
at five weeks old, though the wings and head were fully feathered, they
had scarcely a feather on their bodies.
I will now give a word of warning to my readers. It was just at.
this time that I decided to clean out the nest box. This I found was
a great mistake, for the young would not afterwards stay in the nest,
and repeatedly crawled out and fell to the floor below. Eventually
I was compelled to leave them out and place branches on the shelter-
floor to prevent them from catching cold, as none of them could fly
more than two or three feet. They made use of these fairly readily,.

but the smallest must have spent a night on the floor, for a day or two
later I found it dead. I then covered the shelter floor with sacks
and had no further trouble. The survivors, a cock and a hen, gradually
learned to use their wings, and three &quot;weeks or a month later were
flying about the aviary as strongly as their parents.
The old birds did not attempt to nest again, though Lord Tavistock
has since informed me that they are normally double brooded. He
also explained why the young were so long feathering and learning
to fly. The reason for this is lack of stamina in the old birds through
insufficient exercise, or to an unsuitable nest box. The best type of
nest for these birds, in fact for most large Parrakeets, is a natural
hollow tree trunk standing on bare earth in the open flight, and I
intend introducing two of these into my aviary this year (1928).
Stanleys are not difficult to cater for. All they require is a mixture
*of canary and white millet seed, sunflower and oats, with a little hemp
in winter, and green food ad lib., particularly whilst they are feeding
young. Mine were also supplied with soaked stale bread squeezed
dry at this period, but this is not to be recommended. They are very
iond of most fruits and should have a little whenever possible.
They are not noisy, and are perfectly hardy and require no additional
attention even in the most severe weather. Mine have never had a
day's illness in the seven years I have kept them.
They have never harmed Cockatiels, Budgerigars, Lovebirds, or
Ribbon Finches, which have at times been kept with them, but would,
I think, prove spiteful if permanently kept with finch-like birds.
In conclusion, I might say that I have always found them to be
desirable aviary birds in every way and can thoroughly recommend
them to my readers.

to fits. This is because their diet in an aviary is generally unsuitable,
most people making the mistake of trying to get them on to seed.
Of course this can be done, but a great many birds will be lost,
and of those that survive--the majority, sooner or later, will die from
fits. In their natural state they are honey eaters, following the
flowering gums which, all over Australia, flower at different times
and seasons.
They also do a fair amount of damage to the fruit trees ; pears and
plu ms , etc., in fact any fruit that is soft and sweet.
I used to have the usual difficulty in keeping them alive, and, as
there is little demand for them on this account, it is rather difficult
to obtain them from the dealers as they are seldom caught.
Their cry is rather harsh and. unmusical, though some kinds are
not as unpleasant as others.
They are all very neatly shaped birds with smooth close-fitting
plumage. When one realizes that their digestive system is designed
to function on nectar and honey, one can see that the attempt to make
them digest seed, etc., is not going to be successful.
Whereas once I regarded Lorikeets as almost impossible to keep,
I now consider them the hardiest birds in my aviary.
I feed my birds entirely on scalded stale bread, cooled off with
cold water, which is poured off, and the soft bread is then covered
with milk, and enough sugar added to make it sweet.
On this diet I have never lost a Lorikeet, and have never had one
throw fits. It is fascinating to see how soon they know their food,
and how they come down and wait while I fill their tins with
tood--some in their eagerness getting on my hand while I hold
the tin.
When the tins are all set out the excitement begins. They squabble
and argue about it without doing any damage. Some one gets a
foot nipped, or perhaps gets pulled off the tin.
As an instance of success with this food may I mention my
experience with some varied Lorikeets which I obtained over twelve
months ago. These birds (to my mind the most fascinating and beautiful
in my aviary) were young uncoloured birds, trapped in the north of
Australia, and arriving in Adelaide in December, 1926. That, of course,

is our summer time, and they were put in a pen 11 ft. by 6 ft. by 3 ft.,
with 3 ft, square shelter at one end, entirely closed but for a small
opening 12 inches wide extending the height of the shelter.
They thrived exceedingly, and when coloured were magnificent.
Their colouring is difficult to describe, as the birds need to be seen
to be appreciated.
Though tropical birds, I left them untouched in their pen all the
winter. (They were the only birds left in the small pens, the others
being let out into the main flight where they could get more protection.)
They moulted twice in the one year, their own season first and later
with our own birds.
I had twelve of them, and they all lived and are still alive.
I did not expect to breed them, nor have I done so, but as they have
now come to the same moulting period as our southern birds this side
of the continent, I hope to do so next year.
They are friendly and keep together in small flocks.
The native name of " Mother Red Cap " is most apt, as they
resemble little spectacled old women with white rings round
their eyes and the little red cap perched on the top of their
heads. On a cold day to see twelve of them sitting huddled together
on a perch with each little red head resting on the next bird's shoulder,
is a sight that is not easily forgotten.
The trimness of their shape and their brilliant plumage is a constant
source of amazement and delight.
The Blue Mountains, Scaly - breasts, Purple - crowned, Musk
Lorikeets, Varied Lorikeets, and Swifts all feed together, and are now
mixed with the larger parrots in the one flight. The other parrots,
after the Lorikeets have dined, come down and greedily gobble up
the bread and milk. I think they are the healthier for it, and since I
have allowed the honey-eating parrots in with the seed eaters, I have
not had a death.
Twelve months ago I lost 176 parrots in a season, the daily procedure
being to go out to the aviary in the morning to see who was dead.
It became a positive nightmare. Now I never expect to see any dead
at all.
I have come to the conclusion that sugar in some form is necessary

milk tend to keep them healthy.
Swifts fed on seed will die for no apparent reason. They seem in
the best of health, and when picked up dead are as fat as butter and
with no sign of disease.
I have lost them on seed, but never since using bread, milk, an d
sugar. I almost forgot the most important remark of all, which is-
that it is of the utmost importance that the vessels into which the
bread and milk is poured should be enamel or porcelain, or phina of
some sort. Galvanized iron or soldered receptacles will be fatal to
the birds, due to the action of the milk and sugar on the lead and zinc.

SOME RARE BIRDS AT THE ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995109545454545" page_id="56185920"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
The collection at the Zoological Gardens has recently been enriched
by some very rare birds, mostly from French Indo-China.
First, M. Delacour presented a fine cock Rheinard's Argus Pheasant
(Rheinardius ocellatus), a wonderful species not previously represented.
Then the Messrs. Webb, who had been collecting with M. Delacour,
but on behalf of Mr. Spedan Lewis, arrived home with a fine collection,
and Mr. Lewis very generously presented several to the Zoo. Amongst
these is a Chaulet's Cissa ( Cissa hypoleuca chauleti), a bird with con-
siderably richer yellow plumage than the Yellow-breasted Cissas
recently figured in this journal. It was only discovered quite recently
and named by M. Delacour. Then there is a pair of Fork-tailed
Magpies (Crypsirhina varians), pretty little glossy black fellows, and
a pair of Diard's White-crested Jay Thrushes ( Garrulax leucolophus
diardi), a subspecies of the Himalayan bird.
Finally, a beautiful specimen of the Blue Touracou ( Corythceola
cristata) was brought from Uganda by my brother, who will I hope
give us some notes on it in our next number. It is a hand-reared
bird and perfectly tame.
A valuable collection, consisting of about 120 birds, belonging to
the late Mr. Dan Mason, has been presented to the Zoological
Society by his Trustee. It contains no very great rarities, but several
of very considerable interest and value. D. Seth-Smxth.

A HAND-REARED MASKED LOVEBIRD

<bodyText confidence="0.981352" page_id="56185921"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The Masked Lovebird described on page 143 is now quite
grown-up and a fine specimen. She is an amusing and intelligent,
though mischievous, pet. Her favourite amusement is to settle on
my shoulder and bite my ears, not viciously, but with an earnest and
persistent desire to test their consistency which is not entirely
pleasant! While so engaged she will let me take her in my hand
without biting and hold her upside down, while I give her a lecture
on the general depravity of her conduct and morals. On being released
she flies back instantly and resumes operations ! At other times
she walks about on the letter I am trying to write and bites my fingers
and the pen, and were it not for the fact that she is also fond of climbing
about the cages of the other birds in the room and insulting the
occupants, work would be wholly impossible when she is loose. She
is rather afraid of women, but is quite ready to sample the ears of male
guests to whom she has taken a fancy ! Tavistock.

Sir, --Again this year my pair of Rock Peplars have bred, hatching
three young ones. Two of these I have reared by hand, and the one
left in the nest is just about to emerge from it; this makes twelve
young birds produced by this pair during the three years they have
been in my possession. The father bird is liberty trained, and flies
out every day. I have not had such good fortune with my pair of
Crimson-winged Parrakeets. The hen laid seven eggs, but appeared
to lose interest in them, and was most inconstant during the first
ten days of incubation. I left the eggs in the nest, and now after
some lapse of time she is sitting well. Whether the eggs will prove
good still is, I fear, doubtful. I regret that my two Pennant Parrakeets
are male birds ; both appear eager to nest. Should any of your readers
have an extra female of this breed, I would be glad to effect an exchange.

Sir, --It is only through watching living birds that one can correctly
ascertain how their plumage is worn, so to speak. I have noticed at
the Zoo that the crest of the Boat-bill ( Cancroma ), though so like that
of the Kagu, is displayed differently ; instead of merely standing
straight up, it also expands at the sides. The crest of the Gardener-
bird (Amhlyornis) is also displayed in an unexpected manner ; it is
horizontally radiated, so as to look like a huge orange-coloured
dandelion flower-head. Another curious trait in an allied bird seems
to deserve mention, though it may have been individual. A pair of
Manucodes at the Zoo used to sit side by side, one, I believe the male,
clasping the other's foot in his lovingly. Perhaps the queerest
performance I ever saw in Zoo birds, however, was that of two Ground
Hornbiils, a male and female but of different species. They were in
the Eastern aviary, and used to play " hide-and-seek The male
would run indoors and push the door of the inner compartment out
enough to get behind it; the female would then come and peep at him
through the crack of the hinges, when he would rush playfully out at
her. Another game I have seen played--a " solo " one--was by a
cock Kaleege in a paddock, which bent down a twig of a bush with
his beak and then sparred at it with his feet as it sprang up.

Sir, --Indian Stick-insects (Dixiphus morosus) are now advertised
for sale, and as we have long kept them at the Horniman Museum,
and they belong to the Orthoptera, like grasshoppers--the favourite
insects of many birds--it seems worth while to draw attention to their
possibilities as food for birds. They will live and breed at ordinary
indoor temperatures, and our stock has always been fed on privet--
the common green variety, not the golden. We have never had a male,
this sex being very rare, and the breeding taking place without it.
The eggs are dropped on the ground, and look as much like seeds as
the parents do like sticks. The young resemble the adults (which are
wingless) except in size, but have no distinctive colour and look rather

like wingless gnats. The adults grow to about two inches long and
the thickness of a straw ; thus at different ages they would suit birds
of very different sizes. The only drawback is that the eggs are said
to take more than half a year to hatch, and the growth may for all
I know be slow, but we always have plenty of specimens. For the
benefit of those who are interested in variation generally I may say
that, during the last two years, a black or dark-brown variety has
appeared in addition to the ordinary light-green and light-brown forms.
Sometimes several are present, sometimes but one, or none, and they
have the inside of the thighs pink like the ordinary specimens. They
look the most stick-like of all.

BREEDING OF WHITE MALLARD FROM SPORTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999442" page_id="56185923"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Apropos of the White Canadian Geese reported in the June
issue of the Avicultural Magazine, the following facts, from an
account by Teebay on pp. 349-50 in the second edition of Tegetmeier's
Poultry Booh (1873) may be worth re-publishing, as the book is probably
rare--I have only seen one copy of the edition in the Dulwich Public
Library. I believe, however, the British Museum Library has it.
A pair of pinioned Mallard, normal in colour, and hatched from
eggs taken from different wild nests, produced two broods--one of ten
normal birds and one white one, a female, and a second of ten normal
birds and two white ones, a pure white male and a female which when
young was white with a black spot on the head and black tail-coverts.
This bird moulted pure white, but had some black speckling on the
beak, which was otherwise orange ; the other two white ones had
pure orange beaks, and all had orange feet with dusky webs.
The white birds were not pinioned and flew about freely all that
autumn and early winter, but were believed only to alight at home.
Next year the pure white male and female were paired and had a
brood of eight young, five pure white and three white with the same
black markings as their aunt had had ; but as they matured the black
was diminishing.
The aunt was paired with a normal Mallard Drake ; she had two
nests destroyed, but had four young, which before feathering looked

like the mother. Meanwhile the old normal pair had a brood of eleven
normal birds and one white one. Here the account ends. One is
naturally inclined to suspect a previous White Call-duck Cross, but
the white birds are stated to have been very slim and of the true Wild
Duck form. I have seen such birds, I believe of a new strain.

Sir, --In answer to Mr. Godfrey Davis' interesting note in the
April number, I understood when writing that the Blue-throats and
Ruby-throats were kept in perfect condition for several years, that
their plumage was perfect. Their throats were of the bright pink or
blue of the wild birds. Certainly insects, which are given in the
moulting season only, are in great part responsible for it; also probably
the soaked raw mutton meat. Food has a great influence on feather&apos;s
I have seen several times in Indo-China that wild Cissas, at the end
of the dry season and before the moult, were becoming blue, their
feathers having faded as in caged birds. At that time of the year
insects and fresh fruit are very scarce.

THE CROW OF THE RED JUNGLE-COCK
Sir, --I should like to point out that the crow of the wild Red
Jungle-cock is not quite identical with that of the domestic bird.
It starts in the same way but is much shorter and stops, so to say,
abruptly. It is one of the best characters by which to distinguish
the real wild birds from others. It may also be pointed out that
pure-bred cocks go into an eclipse plumage in May and June for a
couple of months at least, losing all their hackles which are only
replaced later on. Sonnerat's Jungle-fowl also goes into an eclipse
plumage.

China. The birds arrive in our and the neighbouring province,
Kiangsu and Kiangsi, about the beginning of May.
As at this time of the year the shooting season is over, the birds
are not molested, and in consequence are very tame, coming to the
villages and looking for suitable sites for their nests, which they some-
times construct in the chimneys of Chinese houses.
One of my friends whose garden adjoins a lake near Kiukiang

to state that my Chinese Purple Water Hens always hold their food

Sir, --Do Starlings capture and eat Honey Bees ? Perhaps some
member may be able to answer this question definitely.
It is quite a common sight on a hot summer's day to see Starlings
hawking the large flying ants which come out and take wing at that
season of the year. They may be seen doing it all day, emulating
Swallows and Swifts, but performing their aerial movements in a
much more awkward and laboured way. This year four or five Starlings
have been noticed on some of the few bright days we have had this
month (May) going through the same kind of actions.
Now it is very much too early for ants, and as the scene of the
Starlings' operations is confined to a comparatively small area, over
our garden, and over that part where the beehives are, the only con-
clusion one can come to is that they are catching bees ; in all probability

the slower flying and more heavily laden ones on their return flight.
A Starling was found dead in some fruit bushes about 20 yards from
the hives some days ago--that was before we suspected them of this
habit--and unfortunately the body was thrown away without being
examined. Is it not possible the bird may have made a bad shot or
swallowed a bee without killing it and was thus stung to death ? I

FURTHER AVIARY NOTES

Sir, --My thanks are due to Lord Tavistock and Mr. Best for the
information and support given in response to my queries in the notes
sent to you in May.
Although I have kept birds of one kind or another from Budgerigars
to Sparrow-hawks since 1909, in fact commencing with the House-
sparrow in 1880, I still feel a beginner in the art of real aviculture,
which of course includes the rearing as well as the care of birds. And
it was with the object of acquiring more first-hand knowledge from
interested and expert amateurs that I became a member of our Society.
I have books galore and pore over them for any little tit-bit of
advice or help to be picked up from the description of their native
haunts and habits.
Most of them contain excellent descriptions and details from the
ornithologist's point of view, but few go into the character, weaknesses,
and little foibles of the various species which would help the aviculturist.
The most useful tome is an old book by Dr. W. T. Greene, Notes on
Cage Birds , published in 1899. Of course, Aviculture , vol. i, is excellent
but it does not give the details one would like. In fact the only man
who could give these details is the man who collects and catches the
birds.
Now, Sir, I say with Mr. Best that an account of anyone's " few
poor birds " is of interest to some one of our members. At any rate,
when they have appeared they have appealed to me. And .it may be
that many of our members are a bit diffident in the presence of such

august writers as our Magazine contains in putting their experience
before other members. Please don't conclude that I blame either
you or your predecessors. I don't think anyone could have done better
in the times we have experienced.
Perhaps this letter will encourage others to do likewise. I do what
I can though I may show my ignorance. The cold dry sunny weather
of the last two months up here has suited my birds, and all the old
stock are in beautiful condition. I have kept heat on in the bird-room
shelter between 55* and 60* day and night and even now keep it on
at night. The majority sleep under cover, and I have not been
bothered with cats, though an owl pays a visit now and then and a
Siskin has lost some of her head feathers in consequence, but it sleeps
out always.
I got a few fresh Lavender Finches and Cordon Bleus in March.
They were in fair condition on arrival, but I kept them caged till 3rd May,
feeding them on white millet, millet spray, and canary seed, with a few
small mealworms daily and water to which was added Parish's Chemical
Food ( |oz. to 8 oz. water), and every other day, instead of water,
they had weak Bovril, an eggspoonful of Bovril to 8 oz. water.
This treatment pulled up the Cordon Bleus tremendously, and as
they were the weaker lot, I was very pleased with the result.
I also got some Gouldian and Grass Finches. The latter were in
excellent condition on arrival, but I kept them up and gave them all
the same treatment, keeping the bird-room temperature up as stated
above. Now they are all out with the other birds and most of them
with their feathers " as smooth as paint ", as the old fanciers used to
say. I have to thank someone but I don't know who for that tip
about Bovril, and I do so here and now, for it's going to prove a valuable
pick-me-up for poor conditioned birds and those newly imported. I am
just now treating some Indigo and Rainbow Buntings with the same
medicine.
My Grey Javas nested in April, laid two eggs, then deserted
after sitting ten days. I wonder if the absence of unhulled rice
from their diet was a contributory cause. Its difficult to get
nowadays. The White Javas have done nothing, in fact are very
lazy and rather weak on the wing, so as polished rice is supposed

to be a cause of " beri beri " in humans, it may be a cause of
weakness in birds that live naturally on wild rice. The Pekin
Robins, after building three nests in various places and pulling them to
bits (I think because the " lady " did not like the situation), finally
built in the same barberry bush as last year, laid three eggs, and hatched
three chicks on 3rd June, and now I'm hard put to it to find live food
for them, though of course mealworms are a standby. The Zebra
Finches have had several nests and eggs, but so far have only reared
two, which are now getting their first plumage and their beaks are
still black. They are untidy nesters and several eggs have been
kicked out. A pair of Masked Grassfinches have built a nest, but so
far only use it as a dormitory : it is a domed structure beautifully
built of coarse grass lined with fine grass and bits of rope fibre which
I cut up for nesting purposes. I have had a deal of trouble with a
Nonpareil Bunting cock: he would not leave a hen Red-crested Finch
(Coryphospingus cristatus) alone, also a green hen Canary; he bullied
them so much and caused such a commotion in the aviary that I
caught him and kept him on canary seed and water for a month, but
as he did not improve his manners on release I adopted rather drastic
treatment and clipped the primaries of one wing. This does not prevent
him flying but is just sufficient handicap to stop him doing harm to
anyone, and in appearance he is much the same and not disfigured.
Taking things all round and the mixed lot I have, I don't think there
is much to complain about, for I know Lord Tavistock is right in
saying that if one wishes to breed, separate and small aviaries are
indispensable.

By The Marquess of Tavistock
Black-cheeked Lovebird. --This species, imported in great
numbers before the war, was allowed to become nearly extinct as an
aviary bird until again brought over in hundreds a few years ago;
since when it has been bred in all parts of the world where aviculture
is practised. Were it not for the fact that the eggs are apt to hatch
badly in the unnaturally dry environment of a bird-room or aviary
shelter, the Black-cheeked Lovebird would exceed the Budgerigar
in prolificacy, for, while the Budgerigar is apt to be a slow starter in a
new home, no pair of these Lovebirds ever hesitated to endeavour
to reproduce their species at the earliest possible moment with the
least possible encouragement.
The cock has the iris light yellow-brown ; the hen yellow-brown ;
otherwise the sexes are alike. The behaviour of the birds also provides
a speedy and sure indication of sex. If you have pairs they will nest
at once : if hens only, they will lay at once--double clutches of
infertile eggs : it is a menage composed solely of cocks that alone
does nothing. The Black-cheeked Lovebird lines its nest with strips
of bark or other material--lime twigs being the favourite. Fresh
bark is added while the young are being reared, the object being to

<bodyText confidence="0.998727666666667" page_id="56185941"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
provide the nestlings with a clean dry bed on a wet substratum of
damp material. Owing to this habit of continuous building it is
important that the nest should be large.
The Black-cheek's extreme prolificacy, combined with the fact
that it is apt to do badly if deprived of a log to sleep in, renders it a
little difficult to manage in cold climates in winter. On the whole
the best policy is to put the logs in a heated shelter and allow the hens
to go on laying, even if they do not hatch or rear many young. If
the logs are left outside they are apt to get egg-bound in severe weather,
but separation of the sexes will not stop laying and the birds do not
thrive in cages. The Black-cheeked Lovebird does well on any seed
mixture containing plenty of millet and canary. Green food may be
offered, but is little relished.
The species agrees well with its own kind and some have found
it safe with Budgerigars, though others have had a contrary experience.
The Black-cheek hybridizes readily with other Lovebirds and the
hybrids are fertile.
In order to overcome the difficulty of lack of moisture in the nest
some indoor breeders recpmmend a false bottom filled with damp
sponge or sphagnum moss and separated from the actual material of
the nest by wire gauze or perforated zinc.
Red-faced Lovebird. --Although as hardy as its allies once it
has fully recovered from the exhaustion of the voyage and grown
the flight feathers that have usually been cut by the catcher, this
Lovebird seems to have registered a vow to atone for the almost
indecent haste in reproduction shown by its relatives, by an abnormal
unwillingness to go to nest at all. A record of completely successful
breeding has not, I believe, been achieved in the United Kingdom,
and even at complete liberty I failed to induce Red-faces to undertake j
domestic duties.
The hen has less red on the face than her mate and her under
wing-coverts are green and not black. The young show very little red
at all.
I have found the species quiet and gentle, with a weak, sibilant
cry. Like all Lovebirds it is unsuited to permanent confinement in
a small cage.

Abyssinian Lovebird. --Another species, formerly rare but now
common in aviculture. Females and young have entirely green heads.
The Abyssinian Lovebird is not exactly a free breeder but young
have been reared on several occasions: little building seems to be
done. It is a perfectly hardy bird with a weak, inoffensive call.
Experience varies as to its disposition, some pairs proving harmless
to their associates ; others very savage. They are fonder of green
food than their allies.
Blue-rumped Parrotlet.-- The little South American Parrots
of the genus Psittacula or Forpus are commonly called Lovebirds
in the trade. Needing warmth and care when newly imported, they
become quite hardy when acclimatized, and can be wintered out of
doors. Their nesting habits resemble those of Budgerigars as they
use no building material. Females are wholly green, but young males*
even in first plumage, show some trace of blue colouring. Inoffensive
towards other birds, the Blue-rumped Parrotlet fights savagely with
its own kind and pairs must be kept separate.
The species is unsuited to close confinement and is of a nervous
disposition. Unless terrified their calls are not unpleasant.
The food should be that of Lovebirds with the addition of stale
bread or plain cake slightly moistened with water.
Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeet.-- This species is not often
imported nor much esteemed by reason of its uninteresting appearance
when young and the extra trouble involved in feeding and cleaning.
It is, however, one of the most beautiful of the small Parrots and an
adult pair are well worth the trouble their management may entail.
An old male is an indescribably gorgeous little fellow and his quaint
actions and courtship display are most amusing. Hanging Parrakeets
will live on almost any kind of sweet soft food but do best on sunbird
mixture (one teaspoonful each of honey, Mellin's food, and malted milk

unheated bird-room. On the whole they are better kept indoors
from October to May. They do well in large box cages, though their
claws tend to become overgrown and need regular cutting. As they
never willingly venture on the ground, food, water and bathing dishes
should be suspended from the wires. Their normal breathing is
curiously heavy, so that it is not always easy to see whether they are
sick or well, until one is used to their ways. For aviary life it is very
important to have only birds that are reasonably tame and steady.
Wild ones hide constantly in the shelter or injure themselves by flying
against obstacles. Blue-crowns are very gentle with Finches, and
I have never known them to injure small birds.
So far, infertile eggs only have been produced in this country,
but American breeders may have been more fortunate. The nest log
is lined with green leaves or grass.
Peach-faced Lovebird. --Although the Peach-face is one of the
handsomest and most prolific members of the genus Agapornis it
unfortunately possesses two serious drawbacks; it has the worst
temper of all the Lovebirds and it is the only Lovebird with an
unpleasant voice.
The sexes are alike in colouring, and although the male is usually
brighter, this rule is by no means invariable. Birds in first plumage
have the peach areas replaced by a dull tint, but adult dress is quickly
assumed. As with other philoprogenitive Lovebirds the difficulty
of distinguishing male and female by their plumage is largely made
up for by the facility with which they can be sexed by their behaviour,
hens, mated or unmated, going to nest at the first opportunity. Peach-
faces line their nest logs with strips of bark from slender twigs, the
building being done by the female who collects a load of the material
in the feathers of her rump. The male feeds her while she is sitting, and
spends a good deal of time in the log. As many as ten eggs have been
known to be laid in one clutch, and several broods are reared in a season.
Peach-faces do well on millet, canary, and oats, and will eat a little
green food when rearing young. As already hinted, they are dangerous
with weaker birds, even those larger than themselves, and fight savagely
with their own kind, it being impossible to induce two breeding pairs
to share an aviary in harmony.

A lovely morning early in October, Shanghai is at its best. The
air is fresh and crisp, one feels good after a cool, restful night and is
glad that the Shanghai summer with its hothouse climate is over.
Also my good China pony, the faithful friend of all the sporting people
in Shanghai, is evidently glad of the change in the temperature. Eagerly
he scratches the ground while I mount him and when I turn him to
the velvety turf of the race track he steps out like a thoroughbred.
We halve only ridden half a mile, when my companion, a newcomer
to the East, turns his head in surprise to the left and asks me : " Have
you bird concerts here in the morning ? "
Indeed we have, for on the trees outside the course hang about
fifty cages, all of the same type, and in each of them sings a modestly
coloured brown bird, as if he wanted to get first prize in a singing
competition. Underneath the trees stand the admiring owners of the
songsters, as modestly clad as their feathered friends, for they all belong
to the lower classes of the Chinese Republic. Small shop-keepers,
workmen, house servants, grooms, etc., have got up early in order
to give their pets an airing and to hear them sing. It is the " Hwamee ",
the flowery eyebrow (Hwa--the flower, Mee--the eyebrow) to which
we owe this concert. But only a few of my fellow-members will know
the bird by the Chinese name, let me therefore mention that it is the
Brown Laughing Thrush (Trochalopteron canorum), a bird about
9 inches to 10 inches long, crown and back olive rufous with dark
shaftlines to the feathers, back and rump dark olive, underparts bright
yellowish rufous with dark shaftlines to the feathers of the chin and

throat and upper breast, the middle of the abdomen ashy grey, tail
and wings dark olive-brown. Round the eyes there is a white circle,
the white extending posteriorly as a stripe, hence the Chinese name
of the bird. Male and female are of the same colour and size. The
bird has a very wide range, for it has been recorded from the following
provinces: Kiangsi, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fokien, Kwantung, and, I
believe, also from Yunnan and Szechuan. As a song-bird it is one of the
very best I have heard, in my opinion even beating the much-prized
Shama. It has two kinds of song, a very loud one which is to be heard in
the early morning and which is continued until noon, and a lower one,
a mezzo voce, which it sings in the afternoon from about 3 o'clock.
The morning song may be a bit too loud and vigorous for indoors, but
to listen to the demi-loud song of a good Hwamee is delightful, there
Is not one unmelodious sound in it. And further, to hear the flute-
like tones of our friend when up-country amongst the beautiful hills
of Fokien or Chekiang is for me, and I should think for every lover of
nature, a gift of the Far East. Besides the bird is a great mimic and
produces the song of many Chinese birds.
Is is generally in the early autumn, beginning of October, that
hundreds of Hwamees reach the Shanghai bird market. Each bird
is in a tiny cage made of matting, for they cannot be put together in
large cages, they would fight desperately. Piles of these cages are to
be found in or rather in front of nearly every bird-shop in the native
city and before them we see the would-be owners in order to select
a bird. Many a cage is taken up for inspection, put back, taken up
again, the son of the Celestial Empire (alas ! now a Republic) takes
his time and is in no hurry when selecting a bird. Finally he has
mhde his choice, now to the price. " What! one dollar half for a fresh
Hwamee, very dear, how can you ask such an exorbitant price,
impossible to do business with you." But the shopkeeper smiles and
with a sweet mouth talks to pacify his customer. Finally they settle
the price at a dollar and are both happy. The bird is now transferred
to a somewhat larger but still very small cage made of bamboo,
where he remains until absolutely steady and accustomed to be carried
about when his owner takes him out for an airing. When he is
rather tame and has lost all nervousness, he is put into the typical

Hwamee cage, a cylindrical affair with one perch only and covered with
a dark-blue cotton cloth which usually is only lifted when the owner
hangs the cage somewhere on a tree to listen to the song of the bird.
The bottom of the cage is also made of bamboo bars, underneath which
is a removable board.
When the Chinaman wants to give his bird a bath, he removes
the board and puts the cage into a flat vessel filled with water, so that
the Hwamee can take its ablution.
No European bird-lover would keep a bird in such a cage, which
to my opinion is uncomfortable for both bird and bird owner, and I
Teally cannot understand how people can admire Chinese or Japanese
made cages ; they are very unpractical, as artistic as they may look.
For food the Hwamee gets rice immersed into egg yolk and then
dried or rather toasted, besides a few insects. The birds thrive on it
and sing well, but I doubt whether they like it. When at a certain
time (during my camp life in Japan during the war) I had to eat beans
and pea-soup six times a week, I was in good health, but I did not
enjoy my meals. Probably a good insectile food with plenty of ants'
cocoons would be much preferred by our friend. Anyhow, thousands
of Hwamees are kept in the way described above, have been kept for
hundreds of years, and will be kept for another hundred years, for the
Chinese fancier is conservative and hates changes. In the south
the Hwamee is also used for fighting, viz. for gambling. For this
purpose young birds taken from the nest are trained, but their song
is of little value. As already mentioned the Hwamee is the bird of
the lower classes; indeed, it would not do for a respectable
Chinese of the old school to carry a Hwamee. Its song is too loud,
its manners are too coarse for genteel people. A few weeks ago I had
searched the local bird market in company with my ever obliging
bird dealer for rarer Chinese birds. We could not find much, but
had bought two hen Hwamees. Then my dealer proposed to visit
a tea-house, where the Chinese fanciers take their pets in the afternoon
to enjoy their song together with a cup of tea and a friendly gossip
with a brother fancier. When we entered the tea-house with our
Hwamees, everybody stared at us. Indeed, a breach of etiquette
unheard of and only possible for one of those barbarians from over the

sea who have such strange manners, to bring a Hwamee to a respectable
tea-house. I wondered that the waiter did not tell us politely to
" clear out ". Luckily our birds, being hens, kept silent. There
were only White-Eyes and Crowtits, and as we did not want those,
we soon paid for our tea and left.
The bird of the refined Chinese fancier is the little Zosterops, the
Chinese White-Eye, and indeed one can hardly find a more genteel
bird than this little songster.
I think it is quite safe to recommend him to the most nervous
person as a pet. Although far from being dull, he does not jump about
incessantly in his cage and his song is not loud but very sweet. Besides
he gets very tame and attached to his owner and can be trained to
take a flight into a garden and to return to his cage. A bird of the
Japanese race which I kept in Japan would have an outing and a hunt
for insects while I cleaned his cage, returning happily when house-
cleaning was over, and when I was deferred to another camp and not
allowed to take my pet with me, it was really difficult to make him
give up captivity. In colour the Zosterops is a simply dressed bird,
olive green above, greyish white underneath ; around the eye there is a
distinct w T hite circle which gives him his name. The Chinese call
the bird " Beautiful Eye ". Zosterops simplex, of which I am speaking
here, is distributed all over central and south China. In the north he
is replaced by Zosterops erythropleura, which is prettier, having a bright
yellow throat and the sides of the abdomen reddish brown. Also his
song is by far the best of the three kinds of Zosterops I have kept
(viz. simplex, erythropleura, and japonica). Erythropleura is generally,
during the early autumn, for sale in the Shanghai bird market, but
the local native fanciers do not appreciate him very much. While
freshly caught birds can be bought for a few cents, selected singers
with certain notes in their song fetch high prices up to #5 and even
more. The Chinese keep the White-Eyes in neat but rather small
bamboo cages and feed them mainly on Soya bean powder mixed with
hard-boiled egg yolk. Besides this staple food the birds get many
titbits in the form of fruit and alive insects of which they are very
fond.
Daily the bird is given a bath, for which purpose he is transferred

he goes for a walk. The birds very soon get accustomed to the noisy

In this chapter are grouped together some very peculiar Waders,
belonging to separate families, which each consist of only one or two
genera containing very few species. They are very individual birds,
having little relationship with one another or with other families.
All are very interesting and some are among the prettiest and most
charming birds that can be had.
Cariamas or Seriamas
There are two kinds of Cariamas--the Crested (Cariama cristata ) of
Brazil, and Burmeister's Cariama (Chunga burmeisteri) of the Argentine.
Their plumage is light brown streaked fawn ; their short hooked beaks
remind one of birds of prey. They are long legged. The first named
has a more developed frontal crest than the second, and has a red beak
while the other's is black. They chiefly feed on reptiles and in looks
and habits resemble the Secretary Bird, which is a true bird of prey.
Seriamas do well in confinement and have been known to breed ;
they live on meat, mice, etc. They move slowly and are not very
interesting, but are strong and fairly hardy.
Trumpeters
The Trumpeters (Psophia) are a highly interesting group of South
American Waders which more nearly approach fowls. They have
short beaks rather like Pheasants' ; their legs are long and slender
with rather short toes. They are the same size as common fowls.
All the species have black heads and necks with short velvety
plumage and metallic reflections on the front of the neck and underparts.

The feathers of the back and lower wing-coverts long and filamentous
covering the whole of the body above.
Trumpeters live in forests and roost at night; they feed on insects,
berries and worms. They make delightful pets owing to their confiding
natures their handsome plumage, and their amusing ways. They are
susceptible to cold and require heat in winter. Their wonderful
tameness enables them to be kept at liberty, but they are inclined to
follow people about and so are sometimes lost. They should be fed
on insectivorous mixture, fruit, bread and milk, and a little meat.
Notwithstanding their tameness they have never nested in confinement.
Owing to their habit of teasing they sometimes become dangerous
to other birds of their own size, but do not usually take any notice of
small passerine birds, though they will occasionally attack and even
eat these.
The Common Trumpeter (P. crepitans) of Guiana is pearly grey on
the back and the feathers in front of the neck are metallic blue-green.
The White-Winged Trumpeter (P. leucoptera) from the Amazon
and Peru has the wing-coverts white and is purple in front of the neck,
with the primary coverts metallic blue and green.
The Green-winged Trumpeter (P. ochroptera) from the north of the
Amazon has the upper part of the body yellowish green.

Sun Bitterns ( Eurypyga) are fascinating little birds which inhabit
creeks in the forests of South America. They have a peculiar charm.
Their dead-leaf coloured plumage is ornamented on the wings with
beautiful yellow and bronzy-red markings.
The only species imported ( E.helias ) does very well in confinement;
it is completely insectivorous. This is almost the most beautiful of
all the Waders. It requires heat in the winter. They should be fed
on insectivorous mixture, chopped meat, and ants' eggs. In South
America this bird is often kept in courtyards where it catches flies in
quantity.
Kagus
There is in New Caledonia a fine Wader which is allied to both
Herons and Cranes. This is the Kagu, the only species of its genus

(.Rhinochetus jubatus). Its colour is pale blue grey with oral red
feet and legs, and it has a thick crest on its head.
The Kagu does not fly although it has good wings ; it indulges in
very strange antics and is in every way a most interesting bird. It
does well in confinement, living on chopped meat and worms. It has
not yet&apos;bred in Europe but successfully in Australia. Kagus are hardy
and only require an unheated shelter in winter.

genus. They are large chocolate coloured birds with green reflections,
with white streaks on the head and neck in the case of the South

Florida and the Equator, is a little larger, with white spots on the back
and wing.
They are uncommon in confinement; they should have the same

By Denys Weston, F.Z.S.
In dealing with colour production I quite realize that I am treading
upon dangerous ground, and have no wish to provoke controversy,
or in any way force my opinions upon others who may not agree
with me.
I am indebted to Consul-General Cremer and Dr. Duncker for their
extensive experiments in colour-breeding for my facts, which have been
checked not only by me, but by numerous friends.
As my readers are aware, the original wild Budgerigar is green.
Yv 7 e now have blue, cobalt, mauve, olive,-white, yellow, and different
shades of these colours. I shall endeavour to show how most of these
can be produced by the novice with a minimum outlay.
To digress for one moment. The human race consists of white,
mulatto, and black-skinned people. This pigmentation is caused
by a brown colouring matter called melanin, and is absent in white
races, present in small quantities in half-castes, and in large quantities
in negroes.

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999477944444444" page_id="56185957"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
Now we have this same factor in green forms of Budgerigars, i.e.
green (no melanin), laurel green (little melanin), and olive (much
melanin).
A similar condition exists in all colours : pale, daffodil, and olive
yellows ; sky, cobalt, and mauve in blues ; and the white class with
tints of pale blue, cobalt blue, and mauve.
It will therefore be seen clearly that if it is required to produce
a mauve from blue varieties, a bird containing much melanin must be
introduced.
A yellow is simply a green Budgerigar lacking the blue factor,
and a blue Budgerigar one lacking the yellow factor, whites have both
these pigments missing. These were doubtless first obtained as freaks,
but obviously must have bred true as, if the factor is missing, how can
they produce it in their offspring ?
When these facts are grasped it will be seen that nothing new or
striking has really been produced: only certain colour-pigment&amp;
have been eliminated.
In producing the different colours, we can apply Mendel's Law,
and the following instructions will be a guide to simple colour selection.
It is obviously impossible to publish full details of every possible cross
in so short an article.
A word of warning is necessary. Although Budgerigars pair for
life, they are notorious for their infidelity, and it is impossible to obtain
definite results in a mixed aviary. I suggest that all cocks be of one
colour in each aviary or cage. The hens can consist of whatever
colour the breeder desires. As an example : if we have five blue
cocks with green, yellow, blue, mauve, and white hens, we shall be
certain that the male parent of any offspring is blue.
Green, paired to blue, will produce a green coloured young, which
will possess the property of being blue-bred, or, as I shall describe
them, green-split-blue. These young, paired inter se, will throw about
25% blue; 50% green-split-blue, and 25% pure green babies. The
trouble with this cross, and others, is that the green young cannot
be distinguished from the green-split-blue in appearance, and must
be tested by pairing back to blues. Pairing the young green-split,
blues to pure blues will produce 50% blue and 50% green-split-blue-
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.718123">

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999627444444445" page_id="56185958"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
so it will be seen that there is no waste in such pairing and no " green 55
young need be tested.
Blue, paired to yellow, will again produce green coloured young,
provided that the yellow is pure and not produced from other colours.
These young are green-split-blue-yellow-white, and paired to each
other will throw :--Pure yellow, pure green, green-split-yellow, pure
blue, blue-split-white, yellow-split-white, green-split-blue, white, and
green-split-yellow-blue-white.
All these birds will have to be tested. This again is a complicated
matter, and it would be better to pair them to blues, as all young with
one blue parent would be blue-bred (split-blue). These green-split-
blue-yellow-white birds should produce one white in sixty babies when
paired together.
White, paired to yellow, should produce similar results as the green
to blue cross. We should expect first 100% yellow-split-white young,
which paired together should produce 25% white, 50% yellow-split-
white, and 25% pure yellows. Pairing these split birds to a pure
white we should obtain half whites and half-yellow-split-whites. The
same principle applies to green plus yellow, white plus blue, etc., etc.
Bearing in mind the results from these crosses, we can now introduce
melanin by a similar cross, using either a darker green (olive) or darker
blue (mauve), remembering that the percentage of blue or green chicks
will have the same characteristics, except for the extra melanin
introduced. This will simply make the blues or greens produced
darker or lighter, according to how much melanin is transferred.
The entire principle will now, I hope, have been grasped, and I
shall deal briefly with a few crosses, introducing melanin to illustrate
my remarks.
Providing we have a deep olive bird we can easily introduce melanin
from this bird, by various crosses, into whites, yellows, greens, or blues.
Thus : Ordinary dark olive paired to sky blue = 100% laurel-
green-split-blue. These laurel-green-split-blue will contain a medium
amount of melanin. If the dark olive had been paired to a mauve
(both would contain much melanin) the young would all have been
deep olive in colour, possessing the split characteristics, and saturated
with melanin like their parents. Had the olive been paired to a cobalt

(small melanin) we should expect 50% olive-split-blue and 50% laurel-
green-split-blue young. It will be gathered that the melanin naturally
gets divided. 4
The aforesaid remarks, about green birds containing much, little,
or no melanin, also apply to the yellow and white groups.

This beautiful bird is common in the forests of Uganda, and its
resounding wild notes can frequently be heard, more especially in
the evenings. It is commonly seen flying from one forest to another,
one bird following another at intervals of perhaps half a minute or more.
When flying from one tree to another they always fly from near the
top of one tree and land about halfway up the next, then ran and
hop up the branches until they reach the top, when the process is
repeated to another tree. Usually when one bird is just leaving,
the next is just arriving.

In spite of living close to their haunts and seeing them daily for
seventeen years, I had never found a nest until March of last year.
While having tea in the garden I noticed a bird fly across an opening,
singly and without uttering a note. This was repeated the next evening,
so I thought it might be nesting nearby, but a thorough search revealed
nothing.
The next morning I saw it flying the other way, and settle in a tree,
but in spite of watching for half an hour it did not move on. In the
end I felt sure that its nest must be in a high isolated tree covered in
creepers, in fact I could see the nest but could not be sure that it was
one even with powerful glasses, - until one day I saw the bird's head
move.
On 14th March, 1927, I sent a native up and the young birds were
just the right age to rear. There were two, one much larger than the
other.
I reared them on all the fruits I could get, mainly paw-paw, the
larger bird always growing much faster than its mate. For this reason
I put them down as male and female. Unfortunately, at one period
fruit became very difficult to get, and I had to try unripe paw-paw,
and this I fear was the cause of the death of the smaller bird, which,
however, actually died from parasitic worms on 26th September.
By a curious coincidence a native brought me another young one
on the very day that this bird died. He had got it out of a nest at the
top of a Para rubber tree, but it only lived a few days. It is interesting
to note, however, that there appear from this to be two breeding
seasons, one in March and another in September.
In November I had to move to a house where I was able only to
give a small cage to the bird, so I used to let it out quite frequently
to have the run of the garden. I rather expected it to fly away as
there was a forest about half a mile away where its species could often
be heard, and when it was away for two nights and a day I quite thought
I had seen the last of it, and was greatly relieved to see it back one
morning. In spite of it being out always from this time till I brought
it with me to England in April this year, it became tamer and tamer,
and was really a nuisance in the house and had to be driven out
continually. When having tea in the garden it always sat on the

back of our chairs and one could stroke it and do anything with it.
One day when my wife was pouring out tea it came and began drinking
a*s the tea came out of the teapot and this became its daily amusement,
so we gave it its own cup of tea and it ate soft bread and butter, salmon
and shrimp sandwiches, crystallized cherries, sponge cake, etc., with
gusto. When I was carpentering the bird was a perfect nuisance :
it would come and seize the hammer or saw which I was using, and
I was terrified of hurting it; in fact we came to the conclusion that it
must have been a carpenter in its previous incarnation.
To show its real affection, I must mention one more story about it.
I had been away the whole day, and on returning went into the
nursery. The bird heard me talking and very excitedly went and looked
into all the rooms : at last he spotted me through the slightly open
door and made a bee-line for me to welcome me back. While free,
I still fed it on paw-paw, etc., but it ate large quantities of leaves
from the surrounding trees, and without doubt leaves form much
of their diet in nature. It would be interesting to know whether
Plantain Eaters become tamer than many other birds, as I have known
Musophaga rossce to be kept in the same way in Uganda, quite free
but always coming down at the sound of the gong for meals and allowing
itself to be bathed by its mistress. This bird unfortunately came to
a sad end, as is so often the case with tame wild birds.
A LOVEBIRD MISCELLANY
By A. A. Prestwich
The unique example of a Blue Masked Lovebird (A. per sonata),
recently acquired by the London Zoological Society, has proved to
be a male, and is not a female as was at first thought. This charmng
little bird mated with a female of standard type, and in due course
three eggs were laid. All went well for about a fortnight, when the
female either tired of sitting or was disturbed by the vast crowds
of visitors to the " Parrot House ", for she deserted the nest. It
was a very great pity as the eggs contained well-developed embryos.
Perhaps the next attempt will be crowned with complete success.

In addition to the above, A. cana has been crossed with the fiomely
Budgerigar with complete success abroad by Baron von Grote, as
long ago as 1890 ; and with partial success in England by the late
Mr. Wesley T. Page. Mrs. Higginbotham is supposed to have reared
young from the A. nigrigenis X M. undulatus cross, but this would
seem to be lacking confirmation, although the Foreign Bird Club Medal
was apparently awarded for the event.
Many aviculturists do not care about breeding hybrids, being
under the impression that such are invariably inferior as regards
colouring and beauty to the parent birds. That there is ample cause
for such belief cannot be gainsaid, but a view of Mr. Whitley's A.
roseicollis X A. per sonata hybrid should do much to break down the
prejudice of even the most biased. Even in immature plumage it
would seem to be an improvement on any existing recognized type
of Agapornis, and when fully adult should be an extremely beautiful
bird.
I wonder how many aviarists have observed Rosy-faced, or any
other species, carrying nesting material tucked under the upper tail-
coverts. This is, of course, a recognized mode of conveyance and has
been observed by several recognized authorities. Few birds, however,
seem to adopt this method in captivity. Probably the necessity does
not arise on account of the easily accessible positions in which nest
receptacles are usually placed.

seen material carried otherwise than in the beak. It would be of
interest if members would state which species they have noticed
conveying material in this manner.
Recently, while discussing Lovebirds, Mr. Whitley observed that
it was curious that the three species which present no difficulty as regards
sexing-- A. cana, taranta, and pullaria --should be so shy and timid
compared with their five congeners about which there is usually a fair
modicum of doubt as to sex.

By The Viscountess Grey of Falloden
From time to time in the pages of this Magazine there occur articles
telling of some aviary and its inmates, and these I find most enjoyable ;
so, although I cannot claim to possess any ^very rare birds, perhaps
a short account of the aviary we have may be of interest to others ?
The chief enclosure here measures 60 feet long by 30 feet wide ;
the centre is sown with grass, and planted with box and rosemary
bushes, some yews, a Judas tree, and bay bushes. It is further
furnished with the large ivy and fern-grown heads of pollarded willows.
These are cut off just below the top and placed leaning, with all their
tall, pliant branches providing excellent perching places, high in the
vaulted wire roof. The supporting larch poles are given each a clematis
or honeysuckle, protected from the parrots by a wire surround. A
sunk pool, 3 feet by 2 feet, made in cement, has large flat stones laid
round its margin. A path, also in cement, is carried round the enclosure,
4 feet from the wire walls, the space between left in soil for herbaceous
plants, such as golden rod, Michaelmas daisies, succory, sunflower
and teasel, polyanthii and double daisies ; these get well eaten down.
A green seat and garden chairs furnish one end, and there are portions
of felled trees, and a pile of faggoted sticks for shelter for the ground
birds. A construction of four posts, 2 feet high, with wire stretched over
the top, and a second stage of wire, one foot from the ground, receives
a shake-down of fresh hay at intervals, and is a favourite hiding and

resting place, particularly prized by the birds in winter, when the ground
is sodden and cold. The central part of the roof is thrown up into the
form of a wire tunnel, the full length of the aviary, 10 feet 6 inches from
the ground, and lateral beams 3 inches wide and deep are set across
it at intervals. This higher portion provides good flight room and
meets the danger of collapse under snow.
Wind shelters are made by boarding up the comers of the place
outside, each corner thrown up into a wooden gable, lined with tarred
felt and rubberoid. Two of these shelters have stoves in them,
that bum carbotron fuel, when needful. *
The place has been rendered rat and weasel proof, but who can
hope to keep the mice away ? They run in and round, up, through,
about, and over everything, even rearing their little impudent families
in the very nest-boxes of the birds. The campaign against mice;,
should be incessant, if it is to be successful.
Most of the birds have come to this aviary from less happy circum-
stances. Shop-weary birds get here, rather than gay ones, they have so
much less chance of being bought than the smart Parrots. In this
aviary, and in some enclosures adjoining it, live a G-rey African and two
Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots, an Orange-winged Amazon, a Hawk-
headed Parrot, and a pair of Crimson Wings ; two Guiana Parrotlets,
four Rock Peplars, two pf which breed every year ; Masked Doves,
Emerald Spotted Doves, a Senegal Parrot, two Plumed Ground Doves,
Nonpareil and Indigo Buntings, Bullfinches, Goldfinches, Siskins,
Indian White-eyed Tits, Java Sparrows, Cordon Bleus, Senegal
Finches, Firefinches, Combassous, two pairs of King Parrakeets,
a pair of Pennants, and, I hope my readers will not curl the lip
of scorn, a host of Canaries. These sit in the bare boughs of the
Judas tree, and make it look as if it were covered with alamanda
blossom. Only those who have heard a quantity of Canaries singing
on a sunny day in January, sending sheaves of crystal notes out upon
the keen winter air, can know how lovely the glittering sound can be-
lt is very like the massed effect of Skylarks singing. Both the
Nonpareil and Indigo Buntings uplift their voices, something in the
manner of a Dunnock's song ; but the song of the Indigo Bunting is
sharper ; there is almost a touch of dentristy about it. The sweetest

call-note I know among the foreign Finches, is that of the Firefinch,
and Long-tailed Grass Finch. The Cordon Bleu has an exquisite
utterance, like the packet of singing needles in the Fairy Tale that
made the Princess' task so pleasant. I think it must be such notes
as these that W. H. Hudson writes of in the pages of Far Away and
Long Ago, when he is describing the host of small Finches con-
gregating melodiously in the orchards of blossoming peach-trees ;
a memory of his youth.
My Bullfinch has had three nests in all, but so far her eggs have
been clear. I first noticed her inclination to build by seeing her fly
repeatedly into corners, perch a moment, looking from side to side,
and so continue, appearing in turn eagerly expectant and blankly
disappointed, and concerned. So I furnished one of these corners
with a mass of pea-sticks, and threaded dark layers of cedar boughs
among them. Then I filled a basket with the top sweepings from
a neighbouring wood, after which I cut a hank from the mane of the
garden horse, which hair I cut again into shorter lengths, so that no
slender feet should get entangled in that extraordinarily strong stuff.
These materials I scattered, and within ten minutes she had commenced
building. All her movements were alert, joyful, dexterous. She swung
her black tail laterally, setting her ebon cap sideways as she chose
her twig. She built without ceasing till the nest had taken form,
in its early stage, of a small raft of twigs. Then she rested. Next
day by noon, she had formed the cup shape and reached the point
of lining it with horsehair. She would take a bit, rearing her head
back, on tiptoe to loosen the hair from its moorings. She would hop
daintily backward till it was freed. Then away she darted with it
in sudden furtive flight, or catching sight of the cock Bullfinch, she
would, with tuft of building material still in her beak, chase him with
speed and animus. The cock Bullfinch in aviary life takes no part
in the building. I do not know if this is so when living under natural
conditions. Once I was aware of his song, and found him close beside
my chair, on the soil by the golden rod. This song is so seldom heard
in wild life because of its exceeding softness. Bullfinches trained
to pipe, abandon their native song, exchanging it for something more
commonplace ; for the woodland song of the Bullfinch is a very special

thing ; it is so intimate and yet so remote. Almost like something
" Kilmeny " might have heard when she entered upon that other
plane of finer consciousness. The call note of the Bullfinch on the
other hand, though soft, is very noticeable.
The first nest the Masked Doves made was a case of clever hiding.
The slightest fabric, a few straws of withered grass, was placed on the
roof of a Dove's cage that had been thatched with straw. This nest
passed unnoticed by the aviary attendant and myself till the pair of
young were fully quilled.
We have reared Californian Quail in this aviary, and all the more
ordinary of the foreign Finches. The Bock Peplars breed each year
in one of the tall wooden nests, built after Lord Tavistock's instructions,
and for the last three years most successfully. I rear some by hand
every year. The mating instinct of birds kept under artificial con-
ditions sometimes leads to curious developments. The Bock Peplar
that I first reared, now a fine young cock bird of three years, has given
his affection to Edith, the Bing-Dove ; who finds her place in this
collection by reason of her great use in brooding--if occasion arises--
more valuable eggs than her own. He champions her against the
whole Parrot group, utters her call-note, the inane laughing sound
that is one of the Bing-dove's utterances ; he whistles a ditty when
she alights on the perch beside him, and unlike Lord Byron who could
not bear to see his wife eat, he evinces the greatest contentment and
vigilance while the Bing-dove is enjoying the white bread-crumbs
that she loves.
A pleasant feature in this aviary are the .stone feeding-tables,
made out of the old rick " staddles ". These originally supported
granaries to render them rat-proof. But in the aviary the upper
piece or cap is placed with its larger plane uppermost. These make
fine weather-proof furniture. There is also a feeding-board of slatted
wood set up high, on wooden posts, to hold the green food, seeding
grasses, with their roots, and all the large family of fresh plants supplied
to the birds. The slats let all the moisture through so that nothing
rots or decays there.
Most of the birds are tame in this aviary. A Dove will fly the full
length of the place and alight upon me to spread her wing in a sun-

attitude. The Rock Peplar perches on anyone's shoulder ; he loves
to steal a posy or drink a crystal ear-ring ; and three of the Parrots
have the freedom of the garden. Indeed, I believe more could be done
generally with Parrots in this way. Ours show the greatest intelligence
in dealing with their liberty. But it is essential for success that the
cage to which they have been accustomed be put out for them in some
prominent position, and there need be little fear of their safe return.
When we pay our morning visit to the aviary, basket of titbits in hand,
it is not long before the birds arrive upon us. The Amazon Parrot
approaches ponderously, wondering if one is going to prove worth a
journey or not; he lays a jargoon eye upon the basket; if it contains
cake or raisins, he has no doubt in the matter. The Crested Ground
Doves give their muted call, and the Emerald Spotted Dove sounds
its note profoundly. Surely this is the most mournful of the Dove
tribe ? Andrew Marvell, who tells us at once so beautifully and
accurately that
" The Nightingale does here make choice
To sing the trials of her voice,
Low shrubs she sits in, and adorns
With music high, the squatted thorns."
Says elsewhere of the Dove's notes--
" But why should two such lovers mourn
That in such equal flames do burn ? "
But, alas, the flames that consume the Doves, feed on all the passions,
envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness, if not the more insidious malice.
To such a pass has this brought them here that now, having
reared five young and being a company of seven, with two male birds
among them, owing to their own constant interference with each other
they frustrate any attempt at breeding ; so they are going to be given
the freedom of the trees. The mournful note of the Emerald Spotted
Dove reminds one of the saying " A dule of Doves ", this occurs
among those pleasant old terms descriptive of birds in companies ;
such as a spring of Teal, a sute (or suite ?) of Mallards, a nye of
Pheasants, a fall of Woodcock, a building of Rooks, an exaltation of
Skylarks, and a dule of Doves. It seems to me that this may be

these terms is used by Gilbert White, though he no doubt knew them
all. He writes of a " charm of Goldfinches
Sitting among all these creatures, one finds delight in the colours
of their plumes, the diversity of their ways, their fleet games in curving
flight, their joy in water. The various and interesting character of
their respective Spring display during the mating season, and, if once
they are tamed, their affection towards those who own them. One
sees the Parrot's rain-dance, rhythmic and measured, the noble wings
set in static gesture ; like some design in wrought iron. And on those
days when the outer world presses less hardly, one can share with
the birds, gratefully, the unbroken quiet of their noonday repose.

It was recorded in the Avicultural Magazine for April that a pair
of Virginian Eagle Owls belonging to Mr. J. S. Lewis had gone to nest
and were incubating two eggs, but it was greatly feared that the eggs
were infertile. The female Owl sat steadily from 1st March to 21st
April, and hope fell to zero. On the 21st, however, she left the scrape
to fetch a young rabbit which had been thrown towards her, and
revealed a nestling about three days old by the side of an addled egg.
She was back again in a flash, but we could see that the nestling was
covered with greyish fluff and had a conspicuously black beak.
We did not see it again until the 27th when it had nearly doubled
in size and was able to stand. Its mother still brooded it, but stood
over it when feeding and allowed it to try and pull morsels for itself.
Two days later it was seen to walk towards her uttering squeaks while
she fetched food. Unlike what I have observed when B. ignavus
has young, the male bird did not carry food to the scrape but confined
himself to standing on guard glaring and snapping fiercely at intruders.
By the 15th May the nestling was no longer brooded ; its wing
feathers were showing and it could walk about the shed, but its parents

would not allow it to come into the flight. They perched above it
and redoubled their vigilance, even threatening intruders in the next
aviary. The chick was first allowed in the flight on 20th May, but was
called inside when a shower came on. It was still in down, but its
face was feathered and its flights about half grown. It flew to a perch
on 2nd June, and from then onward was not much on the ground, it
fed itself to a certain extent but still relied on its mother for the bulk
of its nourishment. It grew and feathered very fast. It first made
its appearance on a perch in the flight on 5th June, sitting between its
parents, and nearly as tall as they. It snapped as loudly and fiercely
and pounced down on its portion of rabbit, carrying it into the inner
compartment.
By the end of June it was fully fledged and had lost most of its
down. It is rather paler than the old birds, but not noticeably so.
The ear tufts are indicated but as yet (9th July) not visible above the
down.
The old birds still watch over and protect it, but it is quite
independent and able to take its own part. It is believed that it is
the first of its kind to be bred in captivity.
Virginian Eagle Owls are very large handsome birds, fierce and
fearless in disposition and very powerful. They are armed with
formidable talons and in the breeding season have no fear of man at
any rate in an aviary. It can easily be imagined how a pair of these
Great Owls will harry a country side when they have young to feed and
what toll they will levy on poultry farms and farm yards.

The Budgerigar Bulletin for June contains a summary of results
in hereditary experiments on Budgerigars by General-Konsul C. H.
Cremer. General Cremer has probably studied the subject more
thoroughly than anyone. He enumerates no less than twelve distinct
colour-breeds, namely, (1) olive, (2) dark green or laurel green, (3) light
green, (4) yellow olive, (5) dark yellow, (6) light yellow, (7) mauve,
(8) cobalt, (9)|light or sky blue, (10) white with mauve tinge, (11) white
with cobalt tinge, (12) white with light-blue tinge.

General Cremer has worked out elaborate formulse for the breeding
of the various colours, and those who are able to follow him should be
able to produce what colour they desire within certain limits, providing
they have the stock to work with, but the deeper one goes into the
subject the more complicated does it become. Every breeder of
Budgerigars, however, if he wishes to produce colour varieties will find
much that is helpful to them by carefully digesting the results of General
Cremer's very thorough work.
Mr. M. T. Allen gives an interesting account of experiments in
the winter breeding of Budgerigars. He installed into his aviaries
a system of electric lighting, one lamp to each compartment, controlled
by a time switch which was set to give light from 5.30 to 8 a.m.
Hatching became general about the 1st of December and was most-
successful, the same happening with the second broods which left the
nest in February. All of the birds were rare colour-varieties--cobalts
bred with cobalt-bred olives. All left the nest in a perfectly fit state
in the regulation twenty-eight days. No green food was available,
the birds subsisting entirely upon white and spray millet and canary
seed.
Among birds recently imported were some very fine Pileated or
Bed-capped Parrakeets (Porphyrocephalus pileatus) from Western
Australia, a species that has not been seen in this country for many
years past. It frequents the wooded country of the south-west,
flying up from the grassy sides of the track as one drives past in a
buggy, or from the open glades amongst the gum-trees. It was one
of the birds that delighted me when there in January, 1908, the other
Parrots one came across being Baudin's Black Cockatoo, the Stanley
Parrakeet, and the exquisite Purple-crowned Lorikeet.
A Cock-of-the-Bock arrived recently also and some examples
of the Chilian Conure (Microsittace ferruginea), both being species that
have not been seen here for many years. The Chilian Conure should

A White Chaffinch is surely not a common bird, though it has
doubtless been seen at times at our great bird shows. One was brought
into the Zoo the other day and is a very beautiful bird. It has dark
eyes and its plumage is snow-white with the exception of some distinct
tinges of canary-yellow on the back and wings. It would pass as a
Chaffinch-Canary hybrid, a cross which I believe has never been
obtained, but this bird was taken from a Chaffinch's nest in North
Italy and reared by hand.

RENEWAL OE CLAWS AND BILL TIPS IN BIRDS OF PREY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991945111111111" page_id="56185973"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Judging from observations on a limited number of species
it would appear that Nature attends to the repair and renewal of the
beaks and claws of birds of prey more carefully than to those of other
kinds less dependent on the perfection of such equipment for a liveli-
hood. If an ordinary bird has a claw broken or torn off at the root
it is usually not replaced and the blemish lasts until death. When
Mr. Squire's little Malay Falconet arrived it had two or three claws
entirely missing and it was with some surprise that I noticed the
other day that, at the completion of the moult, the lost members had
been replaced. The tip of the upper mandible, which had grown
rather long, also broke off quite short during the moult.
When I kept Little Owls I noticed that the tip of the upper mandible
also broke off annually with great neatness and regularity, the new
short tip being perfectly shaped after the old one had been discarded.
It would be interesting to know whether all birds of prey can renew
a lost claw and how many have an annual shortening of the tip of the
beak.

breeding operations of a pair of Crimson-wings, over a period of three
years, may be of interest. First season: wooden nest-box in aviary
shelter ; young all badly affected with rickets. Second season : first
nest in portion of a rather draughty log standing on earth in the aviary
flight; young died at a few days, apparently of chill; second nest in
hollow, earth-filled tree-trunk standing in dry part of aviary flight,
with protection of overhanging roof ; one strong nestling ; remainder
rickety. Third season : earth-filled tree-trunk in open flight fully
exposed to the rain ; all members of brood strong and healthy. The
parents have been in the same movable aviary and have received
exactly the same food and treatment all the time. I have also been
able to confirm my belief that certain districts are, for no obvious
reason connected with soil or climate, unhealthy for certain species
of birds which, with precisely similar treatment, will flourish elsewhere.
Having kept Brown's and Hooded Parrakeets without the slightest
difficulty in Bedfordshire and found the former species difficult and the
latter impossible at Havant, I tried the experiment of sending a few
of both to a friend in Kent who fed and managed them as I directed.
Although they had been most troublesome and needed constant
coddling with me to keep them alive at all, they have flourished in
their new home and are in unheated outdoor aviaries. I may add
that I also tried fresh-air treatment--with the most disastrous results,
even in perfect weather.

FURTHER NOTES ON JUNGLE-FOWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9958561" page_id="56185974"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The crow of the Red Jungle-fowl can fairly be likened to
that of the domestic bird, if the latter be a Bantam. In both Bantam
and Jungle-cock the crow ends abruptly--" cock-a-doodle-don't "
instead of " cock-a-doodle-doo "--and is pitched much higher than in
ordinary fowls ; in fact, I would not undertake to distinguish Jungle-
cock from Bantam by the crow.
While on the subject of Jungle-fowl, I would like to add a few
further notes. In two hybrids, both cocks, between the Grey Jungle-
cock and hens of the common species--one a Jungle-hen and the other
a mongrel Rose-combed Bantam hen, blackish above and whitish

below--the peculiar sealing-wax-like feathering on neck and wing
was lost, and the general colour was ginger-red, with a purplish-bronze
tail, though the streaky character of the plumage of the grey bird was
evident. The ginger-red on the breast was particularly interesting,
being so widely different from the black of the common bird and
the grey of the other. The hybrid from the Bantam mother had the
rose comb. Both these birds were on view at the Zoo.
With regard to the Ceylon Jungle-cock now there, I note that
he has a small dewlap between the wattles, and a fold indicating the
ear-lobe; also that he flaps his wings before a series of crows, whereas
the green bird flaps after crowing, and the grey not at all then.
In the pair of green Jungle-fowl shown last year at the Zoo, I
obseryed that both had yellow eyes, those of the hen being of a brighter
hue than the cock's. Her comb was only indicated by a bare blackish
streak.
In the hybrids between green cock and red hens bred at the Zoo
some years ago, the combs of the cocks were red, plain-edged or slightly
undulated, those of the hens minutely serrated. The cocks had very
small wattles, or none, but well-developed ear-lobes and also red
dewlaps. The hens had no wattles, but a small patch of red skin
where the ear-lobe should be.
F. Finn.
THE CROW OF THE RED JUNGLE-COCK
Sir, -- I can corroborate Monsieur Delacour's statement that the
crow of the wild Jungle-cock differs from that of domestic breeds. If
we take the popular " cock-a-doodle-doo ! " as a rough representation
of the challenge of a normal barndoor rooster, the crow of the Jungle-
cock may be rendered, by comparison, " cock-a-doo-do ! "

Sir, --Several of our members appear to be breeding Gouldian

At one time I bred a large number of Gouldians and the young

so much appreciated.

A HAWKHEAD IN A MIXED AVIARY
Sir, --An amusing incident happened in the aviary here when I
released my Hawk-headed Parrot among the other birds. There
fell a moment of tense silence ; this was followed by a gradual
assembling of the entire collection upon perch, twig, rod, and bar, and
every available place close to the new arrival. Then, that noise
began of massed chirping in agitation, which when heard in a thicket
tells one that an Owl is being mobbed. The Parrot was obviously
taken for a Hawk, and so concentrated was the gathering about it,
that I could for the first time easily count how many foreign Finches
there are in the collection, for they all sat close as beads upon a string,
ejaculating surprise and annoyance. The affair looked like a picture
drawn in the nursery, when far too many birds are shown on one perch,
and of all sorts and sizes. In the midst of the racket sat Judy turning
her Tarquin profile to the crowd, and dominating the situation.
The spell lasted, and the clamour was sustained. Then Judy,
laid an unexpected " card " upon the table ; she erected her hood,
and with a lovely sound of the rushing of wings the company dispersed,
trying to hide from themselves and others, doubtless, that what they
had taken for a " chef de police," armed with authority had proved
to be simply an old lady in a Salvation Army bonnet! Obviously,

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960263714285714" page_id="56185977"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
Sir, --A nest of three hybrid Lovebirds hatched out in my aviary on
10th June. They are the progeny of a cock Black-cheek (A. nigrigenis )
and a hen Masked (A. per sonata). The young birds are now fully fledged
and are almost exactly like the Black-cheek cock, only they seem
slightly larger and the white ring round the eyes is bigger and more
conspicuous. I should be very interested to know if this cross has ever
been bred before in captivity. [See page 189.--Ed.]
I find an absolute necessity in breeding Lovebirds is to have green
vegetables such as cabbage and spinach always in the aviary. I take
the overgrown plants from the garden and stand them in tubs of water.
The green leaves of these plants, with which the birds line their nests,
seem to supply the necessary moisture, and certainly this year I have
been very successful in breeding from all my Lovebirds.

SOME AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS

<bodyText confidence="0.9981565" page_id="56185988"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By the Marquess op Tavistock
The accompanying coloured plate represents some of the most
beautiful and attractive of the Australian Parrakeets, most of which
are, however, rarely imported nowadays, partly owing to their increasing
rarity in their native country and to the unsympathetic attitude of the
authorities in Australia towards aviculture, by means of which, there
is little doubt that certain species could be saved from becoming
extinct.
The Turquoisine. --This very beautiful little Grass Parrakeet
was at one time, as is well known, widely kept and freely bred both in
England and on the Continent and young were reared in America also.
It was, however, neglected and allowed to die out, and as it was
no longer observed in a wild state, it was thought to have become
extinct. Of recent years, however, it has reappeared in very small
numbers and a few have been captured, one or two pairs nesting
successfully in Australian aviaries. The future of the species appears
very precarious. The causes of its grave diminution are imperfectly
understood, and it is quite certain that they cannot effectively be
dealt with by legislation. Yet Australian bird protectionists, who
appear gifted with more enthusiasm than sense or avicultural know-

ledge, are putting every obstacle in the way of the catching of the
rare Grass Parrakeets, and their keeping in confinement, even in their
native land--the one method by which, with proper management,
they could certainly be preserved.
In an unhealthy district the Turquoisine, like other Grass Parrakeets 9
is a hopeless proposition, but in a reasonably healthy one its manage-
ment presents no serious problems. Its food should consist of millet
and Canary-seed, with groundsel and seeding grass. Hemp is injurious,
but oats soaked in clean water are much appreciated. Torquoisines
should not be exposed to great cold; an unheated bird-room probably
represents the maximum degree of exposure to which they can be
subjected with safety, while warmed winter quarters are preferable,
especially as they are late moulters.
Turquoisines, like their near allies, have a fatal habit of dashing
against the roof of their cage or aviary flight when suddenly alarmed.
For this reason it is prudent to provide the former with a false top of
taut canvas, and the latter with a false roof of string netting : the
netting will require regular attention or it will stretch slack and become
useless.
As Turquoisines are very sensitive to infectious disease, and while
amiable with other birds are intolerant of the presence of their
own kind, a movable aviary for each pair is desirable. While there is i
no doubt that the species could be perpetuated in captivity as success-
fully as the Budgerigar, it is most important to realize that it cannot
be managed successfully by the same methods and at the same low cost
as that gregarious species which is uniquely tolerant of stale ground and
close confinement.
On account of the simple nature of their diet, Turquoisines travel
well if their special requirements in the way of cleanliness are observed.
It is absolutely essential that the travelling boxes should have movable
perches and sliding sand trays, which are washed daily, and that not more
than two birds should be placed in each box. If these precautions are
neglected the birds are almost certain to be infected with incurable
enteritis or eye disease. The latter malady may not develop for some
weeks, or even months after arrival, and the victim may linger for the
best part of a year, but the end is always the same.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Some Australian Parrakeets 205
The hen Turquoisine is of a duller and softer green than her mate,
and she lacks the red wing bar. The blue on her head is restricted
to the forehead and edge of the cheeks, and the upper part of the breast
is green. Young cocks resemble the females, but show a few red feathers
even in first plumage. Adult plumage is assumed when they are about
six months old.
. Turquoisines are easily suited in the matter of nests, preferring a
box or log that is not too deep as they are not great climbers. Their
habits when breeding resemble those of Rosellas. In a wild state they
appear to be single-brooded, but in confinement there are records of
very prolific pairs which have reared two or three families of four or
five in a seasons The cry is weak and inoffensive, and the bill is not
strong enough to break the skin if the bird be handled without gloves.
Pennant's Parrakeet. --A handsome and freely imported
broadtail, which, when acclimatized, can be wintered in an outdoor
aviary. The species is the least quarrelsome of the big Platycercinse,
but this should not be taken as indicating that it is always safe and
amiable with other birds. The sexes are alike in colour, but the hen has
a much smaller head and beak. Young birds are mainly green in first
plumage, but there are instances of the crimson dress being taken on
from the nest. Adult plumage is assumed with the first complete moult,
though a considerable sprinkling of red feathers appear earlier during
the first autumn and winter.
A hollow natural tree trunk or tall bottomless box filled with earth
and mould to within 18 inches of the entrance hole makes the best
nest, care being taken to see that the interior is climbable. The hen alone
sits, being fed by her mate, who also feeds the young. The species is
often double-brooded.
Pennants require plenty of apple and green food, and are usually fond
of peanuts. Their call is not unpleasant. They are not suited to cage life.
The Many-coloured Parrakeet.-- Though easy to feed, ready
to go to nest, and when acclimatized, not particularly sensitive to a low
temperature, this beautiful ally of the Redrump does not, unfortunately,
share its relative's all-round hardiness. In an unhealthy district it is
an impossible bird : in a healthy one it may thrive and breed for two or
three seasons, but unless the aviary be movable, success over a

longer period is very rarely achieved. Many-colours are extraordinarily
sensitive to infectious diseases, the most common complaint being a
form of septicoemia affecting the blood. Death may be very sudden,
and an unskilful post mortem examiner usually reports cerebral
haemorrhage as the cause. There is no cure for the complaint, and no
prevention other than scrupulous cleanliness and a change of site for the
aviary at least once a year. The Many-colour's sensitiveness to disease
also makes it a bad traveller, and the mortality is very high when the
birds receive no more care and attention than is considered sufficient
for Redrumps and Rosellas. Treated in the manner recommended for
Turquoisines, they would, however, come over without loss. The hen
Many-colour is mainly greenish-brown, with a red wing-bar instead of
an orange one. Cocks in first plumage have a red wing-bar, but they are
always green enough for their sex to be discernible. They assume adult
plumage by a complete moult which is finished during their first
winter. Until the first moult is over young birds are rather subject
to chills.
In disposition and breeding habits the Many-coloured Parrakeet
resembles the Redrump. The food should be that recommended for the
Turquoisine, with the addition of apple. The cry is quite musical and
bears a striking resemblance to that of the Nuthatch. Many-colours,
like Grass Parrakeets, are rather apt to kill themselves by flying against
the roof of cage or aviary, for which reason the cage should have a false
top of canvas, and the birds should be shut into the aviary shelter at
night, as it is during night alarms that accidents most often occur.
The Many-colour is quite unsuited to permanent confinement in a
small cage.
Barraband's Parrakeet is a very charming species, and perfectly
hardy in a healthy district, though apt to give trouble in an unhealthy
one. It is one of the most amiable of the larger Parrakeets, and seldom
quarrels seriously with companions of its own or other species. It is
quite ready to go to nest, but unless kept in very large or movable
aviaries the cocks are often unfertile and young cocks reared in small,
fixed aviaries are invariably useless for breeding. Barrabands, when
newly caught or imported, are subject to paralysis and eye disease. The
former complaint appears to be due to gorging on dry seed after a period
</bodyText>

of starvation due to fear ; the latter is induced by insufficient cleanliness
and can always be prevented by daily cleaning of the trays and perches
of the travelling boxes and by not putting several birds in one box.
Sometimes the trouble starts immediately after capture owing to the
dirty receptacles provided by the catchers. Of Barrabands affected with
eye disease, about a third eventually recover if kept in very clean
quarters with perches disinfected daily and droppings constantly
removed. The cure is, however, lengthy and troublesome, and may
take over a year. It is important that the nest should stand in the open
flight, a tall hollow tree trunk, not too large, or a bottomless wooden
box about 6 feet high giving the best results. The box should be filled
with mould to within 18 inches of the entrance hole and the interior
should be rendered climbable with wire netting. The breeding habits
resemble those of Rosellas, but only one nest is produced in a season.
Hen Barrabands are of a softer green with greyish throats, pink
under the tail, and no red or yellow. Young cocks resemble females,
but from the first show a pinkish tinge on the throat where the red will
one day appear. They assume full plumage with the first complete
moult, and long before they are a year old show some yellow on the
head and give further indications of their sex by chuckling and crooning
to themselves when at rest, a ha*bit not indulged in by hens.
Barrabands should be fed on millet and Canary seed with a little
sun-flower. They are very fond of soaked oats and appreciate sweet
fruit and green food.
Their flight is wonderful, and they make charming liberty birds, but
must be induced to enter an aviary every night in districts where
Brown Owls occur. Only the cocks of mated pairs whose hens are
confined and young home-bred males of the year can with safety be
released.
The call of Barraband's Parrakeet is unpleasantly loud and shrill
in a confined space, though not disagreeable in the open.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet. --Although there is no special
reason to believe this lovely bird to be unduly rare in its native habitat,
the inaccessibility of its desert haunts in Central Australia and the
uncertainty of its movements, combined with the unique beauty of its
soft colouring, have combined to render it exceedingly rare in collections

and terribly expensive to buy. At the present time there is probably
only one female in Europe, and about five males, with little prospect
of further importations. Possibly because it receives greater care on
the voyage, Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet is a good traveller, and seems
little subject to the importation diseases that cause so high a mortality
among its allies. Although delicate individuals are sometimes met
with, and young birds are the better for artificial heat during their first
winter, the species can stand a fair amount of cold and wet if obliged
to make use of a snug shelter at night.
The sexes are alike in colour, but the hen has a shorter tail, is of a
more slaty blue on the crown and rump, and lacks the curious spatules
borne on one primary feather of each wing by the male.
Hen Queen Alexandra's are quite ready to go to nest, but good
breeding cocks are more difficult to come by, partly because males are
easily rendered infertile by stale ground and lack of flying exercise
and partly because they are subject to eccentric and misguided love
affairs which cause them to scorn their proper brides. If the first brood
comes to grief, a second clutch of eggs is often laid. The species is
easily fed, requiring only the usual seed mixture with fruit and green
food. Most individuals are fond of mealworms.
No Parrakeet is naturally more fearless than the Queen Alexandra
or more easy to tame. Pet birds will learn to repeat a word or two or
whistle part of a tune. Nesting accommodation should be the same as
that of the Barraband.
None of the Polyteline Parrakeets are flattered by their portraits
in the plate, the beak being much smaller than is represented in
proportion to the rest of the head, with the result that the expression
is much less " Parroty " and more refined.
The Eock Peplar or Blacktailed Parrakeet. --A handsome,
though not gaudy species which in many respects resembles its near
ally, the Barraband. It is a very hardy bird, though the cocks in
unhealthy districts are rather subject to pneumonia in spring and
autumn, being apparently more delicate than their mates, which are
very seldom ailing. Treatment should be the same as for the Barraband,&apos;
but pairs will not agree together in the breeding season. Hemp seed
can be given with safety. Hen birds are olive green where the

cocks are yellow and their tails are green. Immature males resemble
the female, but some yellow feathers appear before the first winter is
over, and full plumage is assumed with the first moult. Adult males
vary greatly in colour, some being almost as olive as hens all their lives,
though they acquire the blue-black tail.
Hen Rock Peplars are apt to be very fussy arid hard to please in the
matter of a nesting site. If a tree-trunk or tall bottomless box in the
open flight does not satisfy them they may take to a log or box with a
long, slanting spout for an entrance, or they may fancy an entrance
shaped like a chimney pot. Ordinary entrance holes should always face
north, an aspect all Parrakeets prefer for their doorway. Cock birds,
also, are sometimes tiresome and eccentric, refusing to fertilize the eggs,
either from indifference to their mates or excessive anxiety to drive
them into the nest and keep them there while the eggs are being laid
and incubated. Nestlings are exceedingly intolerant of anything
artificial in their surroundings, and I have never been able to rear those
which were hatched in an aviary shelter or in a box with a wooden
floor. They must be in the open and on soil or natural decaying wood.
Tame Rock Peplars make nice pets, and will learn to whistle or
repeat a few words in a hoarse indistinct tone. The species is charming
at liberty, its flight being unrivalled for speed and grace. The same
precautions as to management must be observed as with the
Earraband.
THE CALL OF THE WILD
By J. B. Housden
To be once again in the beautiful groves and virgin forests of
Southern Texas (after a very stormy voyage across the Atlantic ; and
after being held up for some hours in the tail end of a train wreck "
and cyclone in Oklahama on my long journey) is a very delightful
change.
The watching of the spring migration here, in March and April,
gives special pleasure to the bird lover. It is a fascinating pursuit, when
opportunity occurs, to watch the hosts of birds on their line of migration.

J. B. Housden--The Call of the Wild
Quite a number winter in the Gulf States, but large numbers, including
many species, seem to come by the all-land route through Mexico and
Southern Texas during the spring migration. Many seem to prefer
to fly across the Gulf of Mexico, while others take the easier route
through Cuba and other islands of the West Indies to Southern Florida.
This route affords convenient resting places to break the long journey.
The flight from Cuba to the Florida Keys is only about 100 miles, yet
one may see many flocks of small migrants flying low over the water,
some appearing very exhausted. The first arrivals, often in flocks of
thousands, are Cedar Waxwings, Bluebirds, Robins, Redwing Black-
birds, Song Sparrows, Meadow Larks, Purple Martins, and many others.
The beautiful groves of muskeet-trees near here, in Southern Texas,
form a mighty gathering place for the hosts of feathered creatures
returning in the spring from their winter quarters. During these times
they are literally alive with thousands of Purple Crackles and Waxwings
and the smaller Warblers, but in two or three days all this great
feathered congregation is gone, and their places taken by Woodpeckers,
White-breasted and Red-bellied Nuthatches, Brown Creepers, and
others. Troops of Redbirds (Virginian Nightingales) and others are
to be seen. Blossoms perfume the air, the eye is delighted and the ear
enraptured and held with song ; tropical insects and bees are humming
and birds wildly singing ; all these adding to the fascination of the place.
Our house is on the border of the virgin forest, and one can go down
what is a mere cow-track and soon be amongst the swarms of lovely
little green and gold lizards darting across one's path and hiding in the
banks and crevices of the rocks. One sees those strange heaps that
look like soot, which are really the nests of countless swarms of red and
black ants, while birds of brilliant plumage are everywhere.
One of the best posts for bird observation is our gallery (verandah),
near which are some large hackberry-trees, a resort of all kinds of birds.
The other day I sat reading and watching two pairs of Mocking-birds
building their nests in a hedge of roses near by, Purple Grackles were
making a great noise and feeding their young in the trees ; Red Birds
(Cardinals) and lovely Hangnests, Nonpareils, and other bright-
plumed birds were flying about in the brilliant sunshine ; I was

" I hear the Blue Bird's warbling note,
And in the garden-bowers
I see the flashing Buby-throat
Hang poised before the flowers."
I had just received from home the April and May numbers of the
Avicultural Magazine (two excellent numbers), and was reading
Mr. F. Finn's interesting account of the Humming Birds lately at our
own Zoo ; I noticed two or three of these lovely little birds flitting from
one flower to another, suspended as if by magic, and soon after one of
these little Hummers came and settled on a telegraph-wire above my
head in a most inquisitive and fearless way ; they have a very
interesting way of turning the head and looking at the visitor with their
small black eye. A great attraction for them is to put some miniature
bottles, about 2 inches long, covered with some bright-hued paper
(red and yellow are the colours we use) to represent flowers, and filled
with sugared water, fixed among the plants and flowers on the gallery.
These are soon found out, as these little birds investigate all bright
objects on the gallery ; they soon become tame and on friendly terms,
and will even take the sweetened water from the finger. Feathers of the
Ruby-throat flash in the sunlight with the many colours of the rainbow.
Red and black ants and bees soon find out the sweetened water and
cause trouble that way. Hummers are amongst the most fearless of
all birds, and despite their size they will attack Hawks and other large
birds. The nest is very beautiful, about an inch or less in diameter,
and the same in depth.
When I arrived in New York I saw in Bronx Zoological Park a
pair of Ricordi's Emerald Humming Birds that had spent a winter
there, having been in the bird-house eleven months.
Since coming to the Gulf States I have made Southern Texas my
headquarters. I have had for a companion a nephew who is a true
naturalist. He has taken me in his automobile some two thousand miles
into the wilds of Texas and other parts, and has been a great help to
me in the study of bird life in those parts. A detailed and connected
account of all our journeys is beyond the compass of this article, but
in another chapter I am including some of the interesting incidents of
those long journeys.

By J. Delacour
When in 1927 Mr. J. Spedan Lewis very generously became
interested in my coming fourth expedition to Indo-China, and so enabled
the British MuseunTto'share in the results as on previous occasions, he
suggested that we might try as well to get, for himself and for myself,
a collection of living birds from Annam. We decided to share the
additional expenses and engaged Mr. C. S. Webb to come over and
join me.
On 29th February, 1928, Mr. Webb and his brother arrived at Hue,
and when I knew what his requirements were, I decided to establish
his camp at Thua-Luu, between the towns of Hue and Tourane, on
the railway line between the sea and the foot of the mountains (Chaine
Annamitique). It is a most convenient spot, where the mountain
forests, close at hand, are the home of some of the rarest and most
beautiful birds in the country. We had made a fine collection of skins,
including several novelties, at this same place the year before.
I returned home at the end of April, having left Tourane on
*19th March and brought back with me a number of birds alive, mainly
game birds: Eastern Sarus Cranes, Bheinardt's Argus, Edward's
and Bel&apos;s Pheasants, Chigi's Polyplectron, Tree-Partridges, Benauld's
Ground Cuckoos, etc., as well as a pair of fine new Pheasants from
Cambodia, which I have described since as Lewis's Pheasant (Gennceus
lewisi). At Singapore I added Malayan and Bornean Argus, Noble
Pheasants, Java Jungle Fowls, one young Malayan Polyplectron, a
rare bird, etc.
Messrs. Webb, however, stayed behind and left Annam at the end of
April, landing at Marseilles on 25th May, with a fine collection. They
worked continuously at Thua-Luu, trapping birds most skilfully and
establishing them with the greatest care and patience. In fact, no one
else can capture and acclimatize difficult insectivorous birds better
than they do. They brought home, in the best of condition and in spite
of many difficulties, forty species of birds from Central Annam, twenty-
two of which were landed alive in Europe for the first time. A list of

J. Delacour -- A Collection of
Four White-breasted Kingfishers ( Halcyon smyrnensis fused).
Another common, but very fine bird. Throat and breast white ; head
and remainder of under parts chestnut brown ; mantle and tail shining
greenish blue. Ked bill and feet.
One Armstrong's White-collared Kingfisher ( Halcyon chloris
armstrongi). A smaller bird, white below with the crown and upper
parts sea-blue. Very handsome, and imported for the first
time. Resembles rather the better-known Sacred Kingfisher from
Australia.
Two Green Bee-eaters (Mcrops viridis). First importation, and
one of the handsomest species of this wonderful genus : crown and
upper back rufous chestnut ; a black band over the eye ; throat,
lower back and tail bright silky blue ; rest of the plumage green.
The two central tail feathers are very long and pointed.
Two Burmese Lineated Barbet ( Thereiceryx lintermedius) . Green,
with head and neck streaked greyish buff and white. A very common,
not particularly pretty bird.
Two Striated Barbets (Thereiceryx faiostrictus). Imported for the
first time ; darker green than the above, with a smaller bill ; head
striated dark grey and greenish white ; two reddish spots in front of
the neck.
Three Annamese Pittas (Pitta n. soror). First importation. A big
bird, with a blue and violet crown and rump ; back green. Face and
under parts rich buff with a mauve tinge.
Two Swinhoe's Pittas (Pitta nympha). First importation; the
migratory Pitta, which sometimes reaches as far north as Japan. A
glorification of the well-known Bengal Pitta, larger, with very much
brighter colours.
Three Elliot's Pittas (Pitta ellioti). First importation of one of the
most beautiful and rarest birds in Asia ; found in Indo-China only.
The cock is of a love^ pale green above, tinged with blue on the wings ;
tail bright blue ; a broad black band over the eyes ; throat whitish ;
breast pale green ; rest of under parts with black and golden yellow
streaks, and the middle of the belly of an intense indigo blue. The hen
differs in its buffy-brown head and breast, it lacks the blue patch on
the belly.

It is extremely difficult to accustom all these Pittas to captivity,
especially Elliot's Pitta.
Six Finlayson's Bulbuls (Pycnonotus finlaysoni). A pretty bird,
haunting the thick vegetation; olive grey, with pretty golden yellow
streaks on the head and throat; a pale yellow vent. Imported for the
first time.
One Black-headed Bulbul (Microtarsus melanocephalus). A very
handsome bird, imported for the first time. I bought this specimen in
Cambodia, and brought it up to Annam. Rather small; bright olive
green, with a black head ; tail marked with black and yellow bands.
Cobalt blue eyes.
Three Fries's Scimitar Babbler ( Pomatorhinus t. friesi). A bird
described by me two years ago. One of the tickelli group, with a white
breast; size rather large. I often heard it whistle in the forests of
Annam. It has one of the most wonderful voices that I ever heard,
full, deep, and mellow. First importation. Ought to make an excellent
cage-bird.
Eight White-cheeked Jay Thrushes (Dryonastes chinensis).
Nine Diard's Jay Thrushes ( Garrulax diardi), which differs from the
better-known White-crested Jay Thrush in having the whole of the
under parts white.
Four Pasquier's Jay Thrushes (Garrulax pasquieri). One of the
necklaced ones.
Two Hainan Orange-headed Thrush (Geocichla c. aurimaculata ).
These are peculiar to Annam, and to the Island of Hainan; where
they were first discovered. A smaller bird than the ordinary Orange-
headed Thrush, of a deeper yellow below, and with brown bars on
the face.
One Japanese Ouzel (Turdus cardis). A fine songster, migrating to
Annam in the winter.
Two Eastern Shamas (Kittacincla malabarica interposita). A
slightly darker variety.
One Paradise Drongo (Dissemurus paradiseus).
Five Chaulet's Yellow Cissas (Cissa hypoleuca chauleti). One of the

the upper parts are washed with a golden tinge. So far the type
specimen only had been found. A local and rare bird, very difficult
to obtain.
Twelve Black Backet-tailed Magpies (Chrypsirhina varians )*
Imported for the first time. Small dark green birds with coppery
reflections ; bill rather thick and curved ; tail long and spatulated.
Eyes cobalt blue. A common bird in open country.
One Black-necked Mynah (Gracupica nigricollis).
One Mangin's Bed Sunbird (Mthopyga siparaja mangini). A small
bird with red back, neck, and breast; yellow lower back ; violet tail
and forehead, grey belly and olive wings. Imported for the first time,
and resembling rather the Indian Bed Sunbird (JE. s. seherice).
Two Hainan Sunbirds (Leptocoma rizophorce) also imported for the
first time ; brown above, pale yellow below, with the forehead, chin,
throat and upper breast metallic purple, a metallic red band across the
breast, and two orange-yellow axillary tufts.
Some of these birds have been presented to the London Zoo, and to
Mr. A. Ezra, while the others remained in Mr. Lewis's or my own
collections. They all arrived in perfect health and feathers. It is to be
hoped that they will have a long life with us, and also that we shall
have later on details on their behaviour in captivity in the coming
numbers of this Magazine.

By the Marquess of Tavistock and J. Delacour
Anyone who has a park or large space at his disposal will find
Cranes extremely interesting to keep. Their large size, majestic
deportment, and beautiful plumage are all points in their favour ;
besides which they are easily fed, most are hardy, and the probability
that they will live at least half as long as their owner.
Cranes are large waders, not nearly as aquatic as Swans ; they feed
on insects and small animals, and to a great extent on grain. They are
monogamous, pair for life, and thrive best when kept in pairs, though
</bodyText>

single birds are easily tamed, show warm affection for their master, and
are very intelligent. Usually, however, tame Cranes become attached
to one person only, and are aggressive and even dangerous with others.
If a tame Crane is paired it often becomes spiteful to human beings and
a nuisance if one has occasion to go through its paddock, for it is not
easy to defend oneself against its powerful bill without injuring the
bird.
Cranes make excellent parents ; both sexes take the greatest care
of their young, feeding them on insects, etc., from the bill. If young
Cranes are to be hatched in an incubator or under a hen, they should
be fed by hand until they are strong enough to pick up their food off
the ground.
To induce a pair of Cranes to breed they must be turned into a
large quiet paddock containing a pool surrounded by rushes. The nest
will most likely be built at the water's edge, and the normal clutch
contains two eggs.
Quite a tiny pond is sufficient to persuade Cranes to nest provided
that there is reedy covert round it and no exposed patches of very
soft mud where young birds might stick. The paddock, however, must
be really spacious, for there is small likelihood of rearing young if
the ground is even slightly fouled. In Japan, where Manchurian
Cranes are bred in great numbers, they are generally kept in small
pens and fed on grain, earthworms, and small fish, but conditions in
Japan would appear to be different to ours.
Young Cranes are most sensitive to polluted ground, as their food
for the most part consists of earthworms, which contain much earth
and any parasites which may be present therein. If the presence of
gape worms be suspected, the soil must be disinfected in spring with
agricultural salt. Young Cranes stay with their parents until they are
nearly a year old. If there are two from the same clutch they are
nearly always a pair and mate on reaching maturity.
If the eggs are infertile for two or three seasons in succession, and
the birds cannot be given more room or more stimulating food, the
only thing to do is to change the male.
When breeding, Cranes are more or less quarrelsome among them-
selVes, but do not generally molest other birds, but unless they can

be given a very large park it is better to enclose breeding pairs in
separate paddocks.
Adult Cranes kept in roomy enclosures only need corn and maize to
supplement the natural food which they pick up for themselves, but
if more closely confined should receive in addition dog biscuit and a
little chopped meat or fish. In times of drought young birds should be
given some animal food, either meat or fish ; they are very fond of
mussels.
Cranes have, as is well known, an amusing habit of dancing in a
style which is at once graceful and comic. This is not, as has mistakenly
been said, a love dance, rather is it an expression of gaiety and well
being.
The sexes are alike save that the females are slightly the smaller,
have shorter necks and the bare skin of the head less brightly coloured.
The Common Crane (Megalornis grus ) is a migratory species
breeding in Northern Europe, and wintering in North Africa. It is
ashy grey, rather browner on the back. Its secondaries are very large
and curved, hiding the tail; the head and neck are black with
white sides, and the head is adorned with a patch of bare bright red
skin on the top. The beak is greenish-grey, legs black. It is hardy
in confinement, but in very cold weather it likes to be sheltered
from the wind and to be given some straw to stand on and keep
its feet from contact with the frozen ground. A full-winged bird, as
a rule, will not leave its pinioned companion if they are mated.
Two young birds reared at Woburn stayed all through the winter with
their parents, and when they were adult themselves reared two chicks.
But all four departed that autumn. Had the young ones had their
wings clipped their parents would most likely have stayed with them
as in the two preceding years when they had only the pinioned pair
for company.
The Common Crane has a pretty habit of raising the ornamental
wing feathers under the influence of excitement, which gives it the
appearance of having a tail like a cock, but in reality its tail is small and
concealed. Like all the family, it gives vent to loud cries which recall
the sound of a trumpet. Both male and female have the habit if
excited by the sight of other Cranes, or just in order to express pleasure,

of standing side by side, and bursting into a noisy duet, during which
the male droops his flight feathers.
It is most amusing to watch Cranes who dislike each other but do
not intend to fight, defying one another. They turn away their heads
a little and walk round and round each other with measured tread,
frequently assuming the most comical and affected poses.
Lilford's Crane (M. g. lilfordi), which nests in Siberia and winters
in India and Indo-China, is only distinguished from the Common by
having deeper black neck and wings. It is freely imported.
The Mexican Crane (M . canadensis mexicana ) is rather small,
entirely grey, with a lighter head, and the top of the head bare and red ;
its bill is greenish, its legs black. It is one of the least ornamental and
at the same time the most delicate species ; and requires shelter through
the winter. It has not yet been bred in confinement, but has been
crossed with the Wattled Crane. It is a native of the Southern United
States and Mexico.
The Canadian Crane (M. c. canadensis) is smaller and browner
than the above, nesting in the North of Canada and wintering in the
United States.
The Hooded Crane (M. monachus), of Siberia, which winters in
China and Japan, rarely arrives here. It also is small, dark grey, and
has the front of its head black, the crown is red, the remainder and
neck are white ; its bill is pale yellow, its legs black. It is very hardy,
but has not yet been bred in Europe.
The Black-Necked Crane (M. nigricollis), one of the rarest, is
very pale grey, with black head and neck, as are also the ornamental,
greatly developed, secondary flights. The top of the head is red, and it
has a white line under the eye ; the bill is greenish, legs black. It breeds
in Central Asia, winters in Tonquin and in North China. So far one pair
only has been brought to Europe. It is dangerous to other Cranes
and to Ducks.
The Manchurian Crane ( M. japonicus) is decidedly one of the most
handsome of the genus. It is large and white, and the ornamental
plumes are black ; the throat, forehead, and sides of the neck are dark
grey; the top of the head red, legs black, bill greenish. This is the
Crane so often depicted by Japanese artists, and in Japan it is largely

bred and is sold at a high price. It nests in Siberia and winters in
Corea, China, and Japan. It is among the hardiest and most pleasing
species and breeds readily. The young are light brown at first.
The American Crane (M. americanus), from North America,
now almost extinct, is equally large and extremely beautiful, entirely
white save for the black plumes and nape; the cheeks and crown of
the head are red ; bill yellowish, legs black. Its imminent extinction is
the more to be regretted in that it is hardy and could with a little care,
have been domesticated and preserved.
The White Asiatic Crane (M. leucogeranus) is also white, with
black flights. Unfortunately its face, which is red and bare, is.
not attractive. Its bill is yellowish red, legs red. It is hardy, but needs
more animal food than the other kinds. It swallows ducklings with
the avidity of a Stork, but those living at Cleres have never done
this. The species has laid in confinement, but no young have yet
been reared. It is asserted that the sex may be known by the colour of
the hairs growing on the bare portion of the head, black on a male,,
white on a female. This species has a particularly weak voice.
The Sarus Crane (M . antigone antigone) is the largest of all; it is
pale grey, with the lower neck and tips of the wings whitish ; the
upper neck and head are bare and red, but the summit of the head is.
grey and there are black hairs on the nape and sides of the neck ; bill
grey, legs red. This stately bird is hardy, lives well in confinement, and
has been bred ; it sometimes turns vicious in the breeding season.
A full winged bird will not leave its pinioned mate, but if both are full-
winged they may take their departure.
The Eastern Sarus Crane ( M . a. sharpei) very rarely imported.
It differs from the preceding in having entirely grey and darker plumage-
and the bare skin of the neck extends lower down.
The Australian Crane (M. australasiana) is like the two last-
mentioned, but is smaller and pale grey all over and the neck feathered ;
it has a black wattle hanging below its bill, and its legs are black. It
has bred in confinement, but is not as robust as the Sarus.
The White-necked Crane ( M. leucauchen) of Siberia, which winters
in China and Japan, is a very fine species, dark grey beneath, lighter
above, fading into white at the tip of the wings; the feathered part of

its head, back of its neck, and upper back, white ; the forehead and
sides of the head are bare and red, the bill greenish and legs pink. This
is a very hardy species, breeds freely, and does not attempt to leave.
A full-winged pair bred at Woburn did not leave the park even when
their own young could fly. Individuals have been known occasionally
to kill young Ducks.
The Wattled Crane&apos; (Anthro&apos;poides carunculata) belongs to a
different genus, with a weaker shorter bill and greatly prolonged
secondaries. It is large, dark grey, and has the sides of the head, the
nape, upper back, and breast white. Under its yellow bill hang two
partly feathered wattles ; their bases and that of the bill are red
legs black. This splendid Crane inhabits Central and South Africa.
It is but rarely imported. It is hardy, has laid in confinement, and has
crossed with other species.
The Stanley Crane (A. paradisea), also known as the Paradise
Crane, is blue-grey, and has such long plumes in its wings that they touch
the ground, dark grey shading into black ; its head is completely covered
with long feathers, which make it look swollen. The crown of the head
and the chin are very pale grey, its bill is flesh-coloured, and its legs
are black.
This handsome bird is a native of South Africa. It is hardy ; young
have been hatched in confinement, but not reared in Europe. It has
been crossed with other species.
The Demoiselle Crane (A. virgo) is the smallest and best known
species ; it is also one of the most beautiful. It is pale grey, with the
tips of the long plumes and the front of the head and neck deep slaty
grey shading to black ; from either side of the neck spring a bunch of
long white feathers ; the bill is flesh colour, and the legs are black. It is
a native of Southern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa.
This is a very migratory Crane, and a full-winged male will even
desert his pinioned mate ; young birds will also leave their parents in
autumn. It needs a certain amount of shelter during winter. It does
not dig in the earth as much as other Cranes, so can be kept in gardens.
It breeds fairly readily.
The Crowned Cranes ( Balearica ) differ altogether from the other
Cranes. They have short bills, and their heads are adorned by a splendid

round crest or crown, composed by thread-like yellow and brown
feathers, which look as though they were gilded.
There are two species, the Black (B. pavonina) and the Grey ( B .
regulorum ).
The first-named is very dark, almost black-grey, with white and
maroon coloured wings ornamented with yellow filamentous feathers.,
The head is velvety-black above ; the cheeks are pink and black, with
a white spot on the top, and there is a small wattle under the throat.
It is a native of West and Central Africa. In the East there is a smaller
darker race (B. p. cecilice).
The second species (B. regulorum) is a native of South-east Africa.
It is larger than the Black, and its plumage a fine blue-grey ; its cheeks
are white, but have a pink spot towards the top. The wattles at the
throat are larger, and red.
The Crowned Cranes are very striking, their plumage is very fine,
and they are extremely active and amiable. Unfortunately they feel
cold, particularly the black species, and only the most vigorous among
them can pass the winter out of doors. The Grey is a little hardier.
Young of the Black have been hatched in confinement, but not reared.
The Grey has been bred in confinement.

By F. Finn
The peculiarities in the eggs of common fowls to which I wish here
to draw attention, do not concern fowls as poultry, for they are evidently
the result of simple variation, and have not been encouraged by the
efforts of breeders either of fancy or utility stock. The colour of the
Jungle-fowl's egg is cream or pale fawn, and in domestication this has
varied to white in one direction, and more or less deep fawn or brown
in the other ; brown eggs have been selected for, no doubt, as the public
fancy them, but I have never heard that anybody wanted variegated
ones. Yet of late years eggs with speckled or spotted shells have become
quite common, and often resemble those of other birds of the same

family as the fowl, such as the Guinea-fowl and Turkey, and also of birds
of distinct families, \0x25A0 such as Rails, and even birds of prey. Other
remarkable abnormalities besides spotting occur, as may be seen from
the illustration which depicts eggs nearly all obtained from the same
shop : the breed supplying them, in the case of the brown ones, must
have been one of the modern Asiatic crosses, known as " general purpose
fowls", since only these and their Asiatic ancestors lay brown eggs.
Very interesting abnormalities in shape are also found.
Figure 1 shows eggs marked in different ways with brown on buff.
Figure 2 shows in A a white egg shaped like a Guillemot's, and rotating
in the same way ; in B an egg with a thin limy incrustation like a
cormorant's egg, and in C one with lime in little patches, somewhat as
in the egg of the Guira Cuckoo ; both these have a fawn ground. D is
buff with spots shading from brown to mauve, the mauve spots turning
brown temporarily when wetted. The difference in size in the two sets
of eggs is merely incidental to the method of photographing them.
Speckled eggs are normal in the Ceylon Jungle-fowl, and occasional
in the grey species, but though these no doubt have been occasionally
crossed with the Red Jungle-fowl, from the early days of its domestica-
tion, their blood cannot account for the recent appearance of these
spotted eggs, which exemplify what Darwin called the principle of
analogous variation, by which one species may assume a character
belonging to another.
Moreover, the chalk-coated and strange-shaped eggs, and the
map-marked egg in the centre of Figure 1, are quite off the line of any
species of Jungle-fowls.
Another point in which the tame fowl has shown a tendency to
assume the character of one of the undomesticated species is in the
fuller development of the lateral upper tail-coverts--the " side-hangers "
of poultry fanciers--which are only really long in the Green Jungle-fowl.
This is crossed with the domestic fowl at the present day, but it cannot
have influenced domestic poultry generally, whatever local influence it
may have in the Malay islands.
Moreover, as in the case of the chalk-coated eggs, only in an infinitely
more widespread manner, the common fowl has evolved in a line of
its own in the development of wattles in the hen as well as the cock, and

the increase of the size of the comb in both sexes, especially in
the hen.
A similar case is that of the Muscovy Duck, in which the domestic
female, unlike the wild one, usually has the space round the eyes,
extending to the beak, bare as in the drake, while in both sexes, in
specimens bred in hot countries, this bare skin may be warted or
carunculated round the edges.
Also, in the last volume of the Zoologist (1916), I recorded a Muscovy
drake which had bare skin all over the sides of the head, and extending
some distance down the neck ; and a similar bird was illustrated from
a photograph, in the Feathered World, this year. Here we have a Duck
imitating a Vulture.
It is plain, then, that these are some of the new peculiarities which
may arise suddenly, and in some cases be propagated without the aid
of either natural or artificial selection ; as I said above, nobody has
bred fowls for variegated eggs, which were so rare about half a century
ago that as a schoolboy I preserved one as a curiosity, and have only
become really common during this century. Nor, is it likely that early
poultry keepers cared whether hens had wattles, or female Muscovy
Ducks have faces. All we know is that under man's protection evolution
can proceed along certain lines beyond what is possible under natural
conditions.

The Blue Masked Lovebird which was illustrated in this journal
in February last, and referred to last month by Mr. Prestwich, is a
male, and is mated to a normally-coloured female, which by the way
is considerably the larger of the two. There have been two clutches
of fertile eggs, but in neither case did they hatch, probably owing to
the fact that the birds were kept in a cage in the Zoo Parrot House.
The restrictions of a cage were necessary at first, as the blue bird could
not fly, his wing feathers being very frayed and broken. Now he has
to a great extent regained his power of flight, and the pair have been

transferred to a compartment of the Pheasantry, where, being
undisturbed, they should produce a brood.
The moving of these birds was a very simple matter. The hen
was sitting on four more eggs, but I thought it worth while to risk
the move in spite of this. The cock-bird, most obligingly, went into
the box with his mate. A hand was placed over the entrance, and the
box carried across to the Pheasantry and hung in its new position. The
birds did not come out for some hours, but when they did they seemed
to take their new surroundings as a matter of course, and the hen
continues to sit steadily.
The Ceylon Jungle-fowl referred to in the June number have
successfully reared three chicks. Four were hatched and the chicks
thrived until they were half-grown, when one died of an injury, pre-
sumably caused by a cat prowling over the Pheasantry at night, and
unfortunately this one was a pullet, while the three that have been
reared are cockerels. One of the most useful items of food used in the
rearing of these chickens consisted of small red ants, their cocoons and
grubs which were dug in the country and conveyed to London by car
two or three times a week.
The Long-tailed Grassfinch is sometimes a dangerous companion
for smaller or weaker birds, and should be carefully watched in a mixed
collection. One of our members had a valuable hen Peters' Fire-finch
murdered by one of these, which pounced upon it and pecked through
its skull.
Since the Bengalese has recently been imported in abundance, I
wonder if any of our members have tried the Japanese method of
using these little birds as foster-parents for Ornamental Finches. They
breed well in cages and are said to be used most successfully for
hatching the -eggs and rearing the young of Gouldians and such-like.

A PREVENTATIVE OF EGG-BINDING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981868" page_id="56186017"  page_num="226" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Some time ago one of our members recommended gin and
glycerine (a teaspoonful of each in a teacup of water in place of the
ordinary drinking-water) as a preventative of egg-binding. Though
very sceptical at first, I must say that I am now in a fair way to be
converted as to the value of the mixture. I have never had a hen egg-
bound while receiving it, and I have given it to quite a number that
one would have expected to suffer from the annoying complaint.

GOULDIAN FINCHES' METHOD OF BUILDING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971193727272727" page_id="56186017"  page_num="226" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have read Mr. Macklin's very interesting article on the
Gouldian Finch and would like to add, with your permission, a few notes
and observations. The habits of this bird vary somewhat from those
of other Australian Finches. I think I am right in saying that the nest
is never built in a bush, as are most other Finches, but always in the
hollow limb of a tree. Its method of building is distinctive ; each little
bundle of grass being held in the beak at the middle and carried to the
nest by the male. Other Finches usually carry one single piece of grass,
held at the very tip of the stalk end--the seed end streaming behind
the bird as it flies. Obviously the difference in the methods of building
is due to the fact that whereas the bird building in a log is not likely to
meet with any obstacles in which the nesting material may catch, the
bird building in a bush has a better chance of getting one piece of grass
through the bushes if carried longwise.
It seems strange that in all kinds of Finches the nest should be built
by the male alone ; the female taking no part except to place the
material in position and possibly give encouragement, for most of the
work is done when she is in the nest. The male also takes his share .'n
the hatching of the eggs. His " hours " are during the day and at this
time the hen may be seen sunning herself and taking things easy ; but
should her mate be chased off the nest, immediately she sees him she
will show signs of anxiety and return as quickly as possible.

A very curious fact is the way in which the parents are guided in
feeding by the four little knobs at the base of the bill of the young bird.
These knobs are like " Mother of Pearl ", and show as four
phosphorescent blue dots in the dark.
I am sure numbers of members must have lost birds through their
habit of roosting outside instead of in the shelter. They usually choose
a tree with the foliage on it. I tried the experiment of putting a green
leafy branch inside the shelter. This has had the desired effect, for
since then they have always gone to roost inside and cases of chill now
never occur.

A NOTE FROM ALBANIA
Sir, --I regret that I am unable at present to contribute much of
avicultural interest in connexion with this small and primitive Albanian
seaport town, where I first landed on the 4th July. The only captive
birds I have come across so far have been a Canarjq most appropriately
exhibited in the Kafe Kanaria, another one of the same species which
was offered to me in the street as a wonderful singer, but which the
hopeful vendor, on being questioned, admitted was a hen, and two
Eagle Owls--I think Bubo b. bubo --maintained at this Legation.
By far the commonest wild bird in the town is the Jackdaw, which
is resident, breeding in the chimneys and under the tiles of the houses,
and acting as the town scavenger ; the Barn Swallow comes next, or,
I should say, came next as, during the past week the vast majority
have departed southwards. This Swallow favours generally Chelidon
r. rustica, but I have seen individuals which appear to be nearer
C. r. transitiva. The House Sparrow (I have not yet determined its
race) coming a poor third. There were a few Swifts when I first arrived,
but these have since left. The only other bird seen within the precincts
of the town is a Little Owl. I have so far had few opportunities of
exploring the surrounding country, but from the little I have seen it
would appear to hold out most interesting prospects for an ornithologist.

THE GIZA ZOOLOGICAL GAKDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999137117647059" page_id="56186019"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
Sir, --It is in no controversial spirit that I offer a few comments
on Mr. G. H. Gurney's most interesting article "Some Notes on Egyptian
Birds seen in the Province of Giza ", published in the June number of
your magazine. But, having resided in Egypt, and been a student
of the bird-life of that country for over ten years, and, after the retire-
ment of Major Stanley Flower (who was almost entirely responsible
for the formation and, for many years, the direction of the Giza
Zoological Gardens) and the early and greatly to be lamented death of
that eminent ornithologist Mr. Michael J. Nicoll, having been in charge
of those Zoological Gardens to which Mr. Gurney makes allusion, I
thought that, perhaps, this contribution might be of interest to your
readers.
The Egyptian Yellow-billed Kite (Milvus migrans cegyptius)
commences to lay early in February, and I have seen young on
the wing at the end of March. The Blue-cheeked Bee-eater
(Merops p. persicus) is a summer resident in Egypt and breeds both
north and south of Cairo though not in the immediate vicinity of that
city. The Scrub Warbler ( Scotocerca i. inquieta) is to be found in many
other wadis of the Mokattam Hills besides the Wadis Kasheid and
Hof, and its wonderful wren-like nest is not difficult to find in the
sparse vegetation of that arid district. There are two species of Stone-
Curlew resident in Egypt: one, Burhinus oedicnemus saharce, frequents
the desert's edge and the semi-cultivated areas adjacent thereto,
laying its two eggs in a scrape on the bare sand or earth, while the
other, Burhinus senegalensis, so far as has yet been ascertained, deposits
its eggs only on the flat roofs of buildings. The Sardinian Warbler
(Sylvia m. melancephala) has not, I believe, been known to breed in
Egypt, but it may frequently be heard singing in the Cairo district
during the winter and early spring months.
With regard to the Giza Zoological Gardens, the keeper staff last
year was, with one exception, entirely Egyptian, the vast majority
of the members of which had been trained to their present state of
efficiency by Major Flower and the other experienced British officials
on his staff.

The large piece of ornamental water in the middle of the Gardens--
known as the Tea Island Lake--to which Mr. Gurney refers, is indeed
a sanctuary for the wild duck visiting Egypt during the winter months.
In a good duck year as many as 3,000 Shoveller and Teal have been
on that lake at one and the same time, the greatest number usually
in mid-February. During the winters of 1925-6 and 1926-7, in
addition to the last-named species, the following from time to time
were observed on the lake in question:--Tufted Duck ( Nyroca fuligula ),
White-eyed Pochard (Nyroca n. nyroca), Common Pochard ( Nyroca
f. ferina), Wigeon (Anas penelope), Garganey (Anas querquedula) , and
Pintail (Dafila acuta). A few arrive in the Gardens as early as the
beginning of September--a lone male Shoveller was noted on
30th August, 1925--and nearly all have left there and the country
before the end of April, on their northward migration. The tameness
of these duck while in the Zoological Gardens is amazing, they are in
no wise scared by the noisy though otherwise--for those who appreciate
eastern music--excellent band which plays there twice weekly within
50 yards of their sanctuary, and particularly the Shovellers ; they
fight for the bread and other food thrown into the pond by the visitors
taking refreshment on the Tea Island.
Unless the collection of live duck had been decimated between
the date (1st July, 1927) I relinquished the directorship of the Gardens
and that of Mr. Gurney's visit, I must take exception to his statement
that " the series of pinioned Duck is very poor, and not at all repre-
sentative ". On the date named the following species of pinioned or
otherwise captive Anseres were on exhibition --White-eyed Pochard,

months, and that the vast majority of the individual specimens com-
prised in that list had weathered several Egyptian summers.
I am indeed delighted to hear that my friends and late much valued
assistants, Dr. Kadri and Youssef Sabit, are maintaining these Gardens
in the best of condition. The Beautiful Starling (Spreo pulcher ),
specimens of which were presented to Mr. Gurney, breeds regularly in
the aviaries--in some years rearing three broods.
It is also good reading that there is now a Bird Protection Society
in Egypt; up to July, 1927, no such society existed and all the great
work that had been done in the country in that connexion was initiated
by Major Flower and controlled by him with the able assistance of the
late Messrs. Nicholl and Bonhote and other members of the staff of
the Egyptian Government Zoological Service--a service which has now
been most unfortunately disbanded. Early in 1927 a few other foreigners
and myself, with a minority of enthusiastic Egyptians, formed the
Egyptian Zoological Society, the main objects of which were the study
and the protection of the fauna of the country, and if the society which
Mr. Gurney writes of has sprung from that source and is doing good
work, it is a matter for much congratulation.

THE REGENT BIRD (SERICULUS ME LINUS)
By D. Seth-Smith
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.993889" page_id="56186032"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
When in full adult plumage the cock Regent Bird is a most beautiful
bird, clad as he is in brilliant gold, orange, and deep black ; the hen
is a mottled brown bird with dark patches on the head and throat,
and the young cock is like her, and moreover he remains like her
until he is three or four years old. Most of the Regent Birds
imported are in the female or immature plumage, so that it is
difficult to tell their sex. It is an extremely active bird, and thrives
in an outdoor aviary provided this has a large warmed shelter
for the winter, for the species is somewhat susceptible to cold, coming
as it does from the subtropical coastal scrub country of Southern
Queensland and the northern parts of New South Wales.
To the late Mr. Reginald Phillipps belongs the honour of having
been the first to breed this fine species in captivity. Mr. Phillipps,
in his later years, devoted himself to his birds, and his success with them
in his small wired-over London garden, which communicated with
a room in the house, was extraordinary, and perhaps his greatest
achievements were the successful breeding of the Regent Bird and the
Australian Blue Wren ( Malums ), achievements which, so far as I am
aware, have never been repeated. And, not only was he very successful,

D. Seth-Smith--The Begent Bird
but be was a very careful observer, and the pages of the Avicultural
Magazine contain many excellent articles from bis pen which show
his skill as an observer and a recorder of his observations. In our
magazine for 1906 he wrote three long articles on the Regent Bird,
in which he records the successful rearing of a young bird.
The Regent Bird is one of the true Bower Birds, and the male
constructs a bower very much like that made by the Satin Bower
Bird, though smaller. This is always built in some shady spot, generally
under a bush. Here he dances for the edification of his wives who sit
on the branches above admiring him. Mr. Phillipps has pointed out
how very conspicuous he is when viewed from above, from which,
position his yellow colouring shows to the best advantage, but as he
sits in a high tree and is looked at from below only the black colour
is visible and the bird is most inconspicuous.
The Regent Bird does not seem to be so free a bower-builder as
the Satin Bird, and I have heard doubt expressed as to whether the
bird ever does construct a bower. Campbell publishes a photograph
of the bower in his Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds , but it might
be thought that this, taken in the bush, was really the bower of the
Satin Bird. Mr. Phillipps noted that his bird constructed a bower
in his aviary, and I am publishing a photograph that 1 took myself,
of a bower built in the Summer Aviary at the Zoological Gardens in
1924 . There were no other bower builders in the aviary, and I
frequently w T atched the cock Regent Bird at the bower.
The Regent Bird is an adept at hiding himself, like most very
conspicuous birds, whereas the dull-coloured female makes no effort
to hide, and this doubtless accounts for the fact that adult males are
said to be rarely seen in the wild state.
The food of the Regent Bird consists of fruit, leaves, insects, and
grubs, fruit apparently forming its chief diet except when rearing
young. Mr. Phillipps says, " the more I know of the bird the more
I am satisfied that, in confinement, it should be fed chiefly upon a
fruit and vegetable diet. Even with fruit one must be careful. For
instance, one autumn I threw some unripe, perhaps exceptionally
hard and unripe, grapes into the aviary, and two of the Regents were
seized with severe fits. ... It very freely eats the leaves of growing

trees, and care must be taken that no injurious ones are planted in
the aviary."
The nest of the Regent Bird, according to A. J. Campbell, is usually
situated in dense scrub, at a height of from 12 to 25 feet from the ground,
and consists of a flat structure, slightly concave, and loosely constructed
of coarse twigs or dead branchlets lined with long wire-like stems of
climbing plants. The eggs are usually two in number with fine texture
and light stone-colour " marked with blotches and spots of sienna
or olive-brown, but chiefly with remarkable hair-like markings of the
same colour, as if a person had painted on the shell fanciful shapes
and figures with a fine brush. Intermingled are a few dull greyish
streaks."

I purchased two pairs of these attractive birds three years ago.
Each pair W&apos;as turned out into a large aviary, and seemed quite harmless
with smaller birds. After a couple of months one hen bird died,
but the other three have done very well indeed. They are very hardy,
and quite easy to keep, and make most attractive birds in an aviary.
The birds did nothing in the way of nesting the first year, but last year
they got as far as building a nest. Even the odd cock, who was in
a separate aviary with other birds, built a nest. The nest is rather
interesting, being cup-shaped and built of mud and grass and perfectly
finished. This year the pair built a nest on the beam inside the aviary
shelter as early as April. There were two eggs in this nest, but after
a few days' incubation both were thrown out. They again had two
eggs in the same nest, and this time two young were hatched. In a
couple of days both these disappeared, and as no signs of them were
to be seen anywhere, I presume they were eaten up by the parents.
I may mention that there were only small birds in this aviary, and
nothing that could take the young or eggs of these birds. On the
3 rd June I again found the hen sitting on two eggs in the same nest,
and on the 14 th one young bird was found dead on the floor, and the

other one was missing. This was the third failure this year, and I
w&apos;as beginning to feel anything but hopeful about rearing any this
year. To my surprise I found the hen incubating two eggs on the
29 th June, and again in thQ same old nest, which they had repaired.
On the 11 th July one young was seen in the nest, and the parents
were feeding it mainly on mealworms and grasshoppers, of which
I gave them a liberal supply. They also fed with flies and other insects
they caught in the aviary. On the 3 rd of August the young one left
the nest in perfect plumage, and almost as large as the adults. It
almost at once started picking up and eating mealworms, and in a
couple of days was feeding well, and without any help from the parents.
I am sorry to say the young bird was found dead three weeks after
from some foot trouble. As far as I could see the hen bird did most of
the incubating, and she was a very shy sitter. Whenever the cock bird
saw anyone approaching the aviary he uttered his very shrill whistle,
and out came the hen bird at once. The eggs were very pretty, being
sandy coloured with a pinkish tint, and dark spots and blotches at the
large end. The plumage of the young was similar to the parents,
but had the markings of the hen bird. Needless to say, I was delighted
to have succeeded at last to breed this delightful bird after trying for
three years, and only wish it would have lived longer. I believe this
is the first time this bird has been bred in Europe.

Records of the successful breeding of this Platycercus browni are
few : indeed, I believe there is only one for the United Kingdom
and that is many years ago. For one thing Brown's are not often
imported ; the species is not quite so hardy as the Rosella ; cocks
are apt to be much scarcer than hens, and, like the Hooded Parrakeet
from the same region, Brown's are very apt to cling with annoying
pertinacity to Australian seasons, moulting in late spring and coming
into breeding condition in October.

The Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of Brown&apos;s Parrakeet 235
During the years before the war when Brown's were not infrequently
imported I kept a few at liberty. On one occasion young were hatched
and partly reared in mid-winter, but they died as soon as their mother
ceased to sit on them continuously, and the hen herself perished of
egg-binding when attempting a second nest.
After that, the only cock I could get hold of was too old for breeding.
He lived at liberty in my garden for several years and for a time he
also enjoyed complete freedom in a friend's garden in Kent. His
violent death at the hands, or rather, beak, of the ally of a crafty rival
has been recorded in a former article--" The Diplomat."
The two hens who have successfully reared families this season
were imported as adult birds about 12 or 14 yeais ago. As they appear
as trim and young as ever they did it looks as though a Broadtail,
when properly managed, ought to live at least 30 or 40 years in captivity
--I wonder how many do ?
For a long time the two females had to remain unmated until, by
the kindness of Madame Lecallier, I obtained the loan of a cock. Two
or three seasons were wasted in the difficult task of acclimatizing him
to this wretchedly unhealthy district (which, thank goodness, I hope
shortly to leave) and in making it plain to his wife that late November
is not the time of year when newly-fledged Parrakeets have any chance
of survival. Finally she condescended to hurry up a bit after her usual
spring moult and laid four eggs in July ; unhappily I did not know
as much about nests as I do now and I gave her a wooden box in the
aviary shelter. For a time all seemed to be going well. Then
one morning my nose was assailed by that sinister odour which indicates
all too plainly young birds dead in the nest. As voices were still audible
from the box it was evident that the catastrophe was not complete,
so I determined to remove- the corpse and give the survivors a foot
or more of moist earth to rest on. The hen entirely refused to leave
her family. I tapped the box gently ; then shook and banged it,
all to no purpose. Finally I had to take it down bodily, carry it into
the flight and empty the contents on to the ground, these consisting
of various debris, one dead bird, half-grown, three others, alive, but
sadly rickety and the devoted mother herself. Having made the
necessary changes I shut the old birds into the aviary shelter with

the survivors of their brood, devoutly hoping that they would overlook
the unconscionable amount of disturbance to which they had been
subjected. They did. Parrakeets are the best of parents and rarely
indeed are they guilty of misconduct towards, or neglect of, their
children,. In most cases where we read of old birds " refusing to feed "
it is the owner who has killed the brood by providing an unsuitable
nest which has caused the nestlings to get ill and refuse nourishment.
One more young Brown's died a few days later : the other two lived
to leave the nest and feed themselves, but they were always cripples
and did not survive many weeks.
Next summer, after no little trouble and expense, thanks to the
insanity of present-day restrictions on the export of Australian birds,
even for the most legitimate purposes of aviculture, I obtained a second
cock Brown's. He was a fine specimen and I had great hopes of
breeding from him, but the moment I introduced the hen into his
aviary he attacked her with the utmost ferocity and I had to remove
her to save her life. My hopes immediately sank to zero, for once
a cock Broadtail takes a dislike to a hen, in 99 cases out of 100 he will
never change his mind, do wdiat you may to induce him to behave
decently. However, there was nothing for it but to attempt the
improbable. I put him and the hen in adjoining aviaries for several
months and when I thought he seemed a little more friendly and inclined
to feed her I let them go together again. Nothing doing ! Within a
very few minutes he was persecuting her as savagely as ever.
Finally in disgust I turned him loose and some weeks later he began
paying addresses to a married hen Yellow-Rump with so much success
that I had to re-confine him to prevent the necessity for a divorce.
I tried him once more with the Brown's, but he treated her as badly as
ever and not long afterwards he died. His unlamented departure
to, I hope, the Parrakeets' purgatory, was followed by the welcome
arrival of a third cock, also a very nice bird. Once more my hopes
rose, but directly I put him with the hen he went for her as though
he were the re-incarnation of his impossible predecessor !
Another long wait and another introduction produced just the
same result.
The first pair did nothing all the second summer and only came

into breeding condition in late September. I weakened in my resolve
to allow no autumn breeding and gave them a nest in the heated
shelter. Two eggs hatched and the young survived into the bad
weather of late November when one died and the other was killed
by mice while still unfledged. In March four more eggs were laid
and three hatched : one young bird died after a few days and
another when half-grown. The third lived to leave the nest and was
quite a nice specimen, but a few days later I found it in extremis on
the floor of the shelter, very thin and suffering badly from enteritis.
It seemed as good as dead, but I put it in the hospital at a temperature
of 85* and fed it with raw egg and milk from a paint-brush. Though
nervous, it drank this beverage freely and began to mend. After some
days it started to eat soaked seed and the milk was discontinued and
eventually it made a complete recovery.
About this time I decided I would subject the unreasonable cock
to the discipline reserved for impossible bullies and cut his wing
sufficiently to render it out of the question for him to overtake and
injure his companion. The plan was successful beyond my wildest
hopes, for not only was he as meek as Moses on his first meeting with
the lady, but he soon began to feed her and from that day to this has
been a model husband and father.
In May, as usual, the Brown's dropped into heavy moult, but
strange to say came into breeding condition at the same time and
pairing took place and eggs were laid while they were still covered
with half-grown feathers. A perpendicular natural log, partly filled
with mould, was placed in the shelter, and proved a good nest.
Three young birds were hatched and flew early in August. The
first, a fine little cock, was rather clumsy and inclined to get
down in the grass, so, fearing he would catch a chill, I decided
to hand-rear him. Though wild, he soon began to take egg and milk
and moistened brown bread and in a few days started to eat soaked
seed. He seemed to be getting on so well that I stopped hand feeding
too soon, for one morning to my great regret I found him dead on
the cage floor with no previous warning of illness at all. The two I left
with the parents, after passing through the stage of knocking them-
selves about in early efforts to fly, have grown into nice, strong birds

The old pair seem disposed to nest again, but as it is getting late in
the season I think I shall remove the log. In no Broadtail is the juvenile
plumage so little different from that of the adult. A young Brown's
is a slightly duller replica of its parents.

By J. Delacour
Bustards form a very distinct group of Waders ; anatomically
they are nearest to the Plovers, but in appearance they recall the
Gamebirds, as far as beak, head, and body is concerned, and the Coursers
by their long powerful legs and three short, thick toes. Their size
varies from that of a Partridge to that of a Turkey.
Bustards are natives of Europe, Africa, and Asia and one species
is found in Australia. They frequent downs, bare or covered with
grass and bushes, but avoid woods and marshy places. They live in
small companies which sometimes unite and form a large flock after
the breeding season. The tropical species are usually non-migratory,
but those breeding in the temperate zone such as the Great and Little
Bustards of Europe migrate to the South in winter or wander far
afield.
Bustards run fast; their flight is heavy but swift and well sustained.
They are shy and mistrustful, and their deliberate ways make them
appear stupid. The males are very quarrelsome and apparently
monogamous; in spring they display something like Turkeys, showing
off their tufts of ornamental feathers, crests or collars which are
developed on the heads and necks of the different species at this time
of year. They often fight fiercely. Their food consists chiefly of leaves,
shoots, grain, berries, and insects, which last are indispensable to the
young, which are hatched covered with down, and able to run.
Bustards are rather delicate in confinement. Their worst enemy
is damp, against which they must be carefully guarded. On account
of this they have often to be shut up at night in a very dry place and
kept in throughout rainy periods. Only really well acclimatized birds
may be left out in all weathers. Chicks hatched under a hen become
tame, but adult subjects are extremely refractory, frequently refuse

food, and have to be forcibly fed, and some time elapses before they
will begin to feed naturally. It is a good thing to put a tame bird of
the same size with them, as seeing it eat may induce them to follow
its example. Their food should be grain, bread, a mixture of bran and
biscuit, with plenty of green stuff and a little chopped meat.
It is rare to come across Bustards in confinement, which is a great
pity, for they are fine birds and very ornamental. Once acclimatized
they are long lived and the two European species have bred in a park.
The more space can be given them the better they thrive.
The Great Bustard (Otis tarda) is found from Spain to India and
in China a related form takes its place. It is also a native of North
Africa. At one time it was plentiful in France and England, but it
has disappeared and only occasionally a few individuals appear on
migration in the former country ; such was particularly the case in
1926. Spain, Russia, and Hungary are the three countries where these
birds are most plentiful.
The male is as large as a fine Turkey ; its head, neck, and upper
portion of the body is pale grey; its back, lesser wing coverts and tail
are light orange streaked with black. Its chin is adorned with a long
tuft of feathers on each side ; it takes three years for it to reach its
full stature and colouring. The female is about half the size;
her plumage resembles that of the male, but she has no long feathers
under her chin. It is not easy nowadays to procure this species and
it commands a high price. In our damp countries it is delicate and it
is wise to keep it in the dry for the first year at least. It is a splendid
ornament in a park.
The Little Bustard (0. tetrax) is fairly common in certain parts
of France during summer ; it migrates to North Africa for the winter.
The male is about the size of a small hen, russet streaked with brown
above, white beneath, black neck and breast with two wide white
stripes. In winter its head and neck turn russet with brown spots,
which is also the colour of the female, she is nearly as large as her
mate.
This species inhabits the same country as the former, it is rarely
kept in confinement, though, once acclimatised, it is not difficult to
manage.

Vigor's Bustard ( Heterotetrax vigorsi), known in South Africa as
the Vaal Knorhaan, is 30 inches in length ; it is light brown streaked
with earthy brown, lighter below, with black on its throat and nape
and on the wings. Its whole plumage has rosy lights. A pair was
represented in the Zoological Gardens of London some years ago.
Ludwig's Bustard or Ludwig's Paauw (Neotis ludwigi ) from the
same country is larger and has also been shown in London. It has a
reddish brown back, wings and tail, thickly spotted with dark brown,
and with white spots on the median coverts, its head and front of
the neck are grey brown with white streaks, the sides of the neck and
the under parts are white, but the back of the neck and upper part
of the back orange red. The female is smaller than the male.
The Kaffir Bustard ( N . caffra), also known as the Stanley Bustard
or Veld Paauw, inhabits South and East Africa. It somewhat resembles
the preceding, having the top of the head black, a white throat, cheeks
and front of the breast and neck pale grey ; the sides of the neck white
and the back orange red ; the upper parts of the body are brown,
finely vermiculated with deeper brown. The wings and tail are blhck
with white spots.
A closely related sub-species ( N . denhami) from the Soudan has
also been imported and is represented in the London Zoo at the present
time.
The Senegal Bustard ( Eupodotis senegalensis), also found in
North-East Africa, is only half the size of the preceding species. It
is reddish with brown vermiculations, with grey blue head and neck,
except the front of the neck and a spot on the throat, which are black ;
the face and sides of the neck high up are white. The under parts
are white with russet breast.
The Bengal Bustard (Sypheotis hengalensis) is even smaller. The
adult male has the neck and under parts of the body black, the wings
are white and the upper parts tawny spotted and streaked with dark
brown. The female and young are light brown with dark brown
streaks and have two reddish stripes on the head.
The Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata) from the
Mediterranean is the size of a large hen. It is a very beautiful bird,
orange red vermiculated and spotted with dark brown above, white

beneath, having a white crest on its head and black bands on the side,
of the neck. The hen is much smaller.
MacQueen's Bustard (C. u. macqueeni) from India is similar but
for finer vermiculation, a black and white crest and grey blue front
of the neck instead of white.
Houbaras do quite well in confinement but are rarely seen. Dr.
Arnault has a pair which he captured adult in Algeria five years ago.
They did not feed of their own accord for several months. They are
always kept in a glass house in company with Sandgrouse.
The Arabian Bustard (Choriotis arabs), also to be met with in
North and North-East Africa, is a large bird. It is light brown delicately
vermiculated above with black. Its wings have white spots ; the crown
of the head is white, streaked black, and encircled with a black band
on either side ; eyebrows and round the eyes white ; the rest of the
head is pale grey with black markings ; under parts white. It is
represented in the London Zoo at the present time.
The Kori Bustard or Gom Paauw (C . Jcori), East and South
Africa, is a larger edition of it and may weigh as much as 50 lbs.
It has lived in the Zoological Gardens of London in recent years.
The Indian Bustard (C . edwardsi) is smaller. It is tawny brown,
finely vermiculated with black above, with black and white wings,
top of the head black, white face and under parts, with a black band
across the breast and grey streaks above.
The Australian Bustard (E . australis) strongly resembles the
above-mentioned ; it is slightly darker and greyer above, and the front
of the neck and throat are greyer and more heavily streaked with black.
It is known in Australia by the misleading name of " Wild Turkey ".

I have four young Avadavats in a nest. They are fifteen days old
and the wing feathers have burst through the quills, so I expect they
will leave the nest in a week. I cannot, however, wait to write till
then as I am going away in a few days. As, however, I have learned
a lot about these little birds in the last few months and members are

asking other members to write about common birds I thought an
account of the breeding of these birds, as they have bred in a cage,
might be of interest.
In April, 1927, I brought with me from India a large number of
. Avadavats. They were quite clearly young birds. There was no cock
in breeding plumage among them. Many I gave away soon after I
landed. Some a member kindly kept for me during the summer of
1927 and I kept through the winter of 1927-8 some two dozen.
I lost only three and this was on the first night I brought them home.
The night was cold and though a fire had burned in the room during
the day, in the morning I found three looking very chilled and sick,
and despite a good warming they died. Thereafter I kept a hurricane
lantern burning at night and a warm rug thrown over the cage and
I lost no more.
I found afterwards I had but few hens, the cocks greatly exceeding
the hens in number and I am told this is commonly the case with
these imported Finches.
At the beginning of April I placed the birds in a small garden house
which I kept comfortably warm by means of an electric radiator
when the weather was chill outside. I kept the birds in a large French
triple breeding cage, which was 39J inches long, 15f inches wide,
and 20 inches high. I mention these details because I am convinced
what success I have attained is largely due to this cage.
During April some of the cocks began to come into breeding plumage
and. there was so much fighting I had to separate the cocks in breeding
plumage from the other birds and put them in another of the French
cages till I could discover which of the other birds were hens or cocks
not in breeding plumage. I left one hen in with about six cocks
coming into colour as this hen seemed attached to a particularly
forward cock. During May I used, when I had time, to gather the small
green caterpillars which infested the silver birches, the lime trees,
and the young elms on the heath nearby, and on which the migrant
warblers were busily feeding ; and these caterpillars the Avadavats
squabbled and fought over.
Early in June the cock to which the hen appeared attached started
to fly about with grass in his beak. I caught him and the hen and

put them in one of the French cages and I put what I hoped to
be three hens with three cocks coming into colour in another cage.
On fine days I placed the cages out on the lawn and I think these
frequent airings made all the difference. The sun will not penetrate
far into a room on the ground floor unless there is glass in the roof.
On the end of the cage in which I had placed the cock and the hen
I tied a Harz Mountain wicker cage, removing the bars at one end and
the feeding vessels and I pulled down three of the wires of the big
cage to allow the birds entrance to the nesting cage, and I placed
a perch running across the cage just beneath the nesting cage. The
cock and hen would sit side by side in the sun and she would follow
him from perch to perch. They were quite clearly in love. The cock
started to build. At first he would pick up grasses and drop them, but
then came one or two days of fine weather and I put the cages out in
the full sun all day. This seemed to be what they wanted and I am
convinced without direct sunlight little is to be hoped for in the way
of breeding from these foreign Finches. The paired birds sat side by
side in the sun on the floor of the cage. These little birds seem to favour
the ground much, and in India more often than not I have seen little
flocks breeding on the ground. I have seen the cock pair with the hen
not only on the perch but upon the ground.
After this treatment with real sunlight the cock bird started to
build in earnest. I did not see the hen assist in any way and the cock
built in the early mornings and evenings only : he did not work during
the heat of the day. The nest was composed of the stems of the seeding
grass I had put in for them to feed on. In two days it was complete.
It was domed with a small round entrance hole in the front and lined
with feathers. The hen laid no eggs but started to sing. ' # So,"
I thought, " I have been fooled. This hen is a cock in eclipse plumage,"
and foolishly, as I afterwards discovered, I deprived the cock of his
mate and gave him what I hoped to be another hen. He spent most
of his time chasing her about the cage.
In the meantime events were developing in the cage in which I
had placed my forward cocks and hens. And I would here remark
that when in breeding condition the hen not only sings but the feathers
of the belly are bright sulphur yellow, almost orange.

It was clear that two cocks and hens had made matches. Each
cock sat side by side with his hen upon the ground, sunning themselves
and preening each others' feathers. The odd cock and hen quarrelled.
But of the paired birds each cock fought the other cock and each hen
the other hen till the one cock drove the other cock through the bars
of the Harz Mountain cage. Twice the cock came back and was caught
and it was not till the third time I saw how it escaped and why : and
the third time it did not return. It was flaming red in colour and tame,
and I suspect a local cat. After the bird had flown I placed a muslin
cover round the nesting cages (I had fastened one on each end of the
cage) and so the second hen was not driven out. But she had a poor
time. I, therefore, removed the odd birds and left the pair alone.
It was clear two pairs would not breed in one large cage.
The hen then began to sing, started to pick up grass in her beak,
and bow before the cock. The cock bird lifted up one wing and then
another in the most absurd way. I left the hen alone because I thought
if that hen was a cock in eclipse plumage all my hens were cocks.
The cock bird again built unaided by the hen and he built with
amazing rapidity. I am not exaggerating when I say that between
6.30 one evening and 8.30 the following morning he built the nest.
On the 27th June when taking the cage out on the lawn I saw
one egg in the nest. My hen, then, though she sang, was a hen and I
now know the hen Avadavat does sing and it is a sign that she is in
breeding condition. Her song is shorter than the cock's. But it is
a distinct song. The following day there was another egg, oval and
quite white, and I then thought I had better leave the cage inside
and the birds alone. The hen did not seem much concerned with
the nest and eggs but the cock was constantly in the nest and until
the last few days of incubation I should say the cock sat more on those
eggs than did the hen. At night both slept inside the nest.
Both birds sat alternately, until on the 11th July I saw the cock
leave the nest, peck furiously at the lettuce and fly back to the nest.
" Eggs hatched ", I thought, " and in record time," but as in the after-
noon there seemed no feeding of young I thought it was time to look.
I had put soft food in the cage and hard-boiled egg and Madeira cake
moistened with milk and I could not go on doing this for nothing and
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.52665">

<bodyText confidence="0.998557444444445" page_id="56186052"  page_num="295" year="" vol="">
for long. The cock was sitting in the nest and would not move until
I took the nesting cage right off the cage and I saw five eggs in the
nest. I tied the cage on again and waited. On the afternoon of the
14th I looked again. I saw young just hatched and two eggs ; on
the morning of the 15th I looked again and saw young but no eggs.
" How, then, can I rear these young ? " I thought. Soft food,
hard-boiled egg, Madeira cake the parent birds did not touch nor
seeding grass, and they kept searching all round the floor of the cage
for something. I had arranged for a supply of live ants' eggs, but they
did not come as promised. The only hope was aphis flies. Fortunately,
it was Sunday and I had the time. I got all the aphis flies I could
and these the parent birds attacked at once. I saw them also eating
lettuce and Indian millet. I have found Avadavats very fond of
lettuce of a particular kind : the inside tender leaves of cabbage
lettuce. Cos lettuce is too coarse. I could not go on all the week
collecting aphis flies, so early on the Monday I bought some mealworms
and gave the smallest. These the birds eat at once, running the worms
through the bill and leaving the hard skin : and on Tuesday the ants'
eggs arrived. These were really what the parent birds were waiting
for and they eat them greedily and flew up to the nest. Foolishly
I continued the mealworms. I had heard that they were heating--
but I thought a dozen or so a day would not matter. It did, because
on the Friday morning when I went to the birds I saw the hen jumping
lightly from perch to perch with a naked young one in her beak.
" This," I thought, " is the effect of mealworms and slender are my
chances of success." She dropped the young and I took it out of the
cage. It had been a sturdy little beast, but having been suspended
by the neck, was dead.
I stopped the mealworms and that night I drew the curtains of the
bird room to keep out the early morning sun. The hen clearly wanted
something to subdue her. When I went to the birds on Saturday
morning both were on the nest. The young for the time being were
safe.
From that time all has gone well but for the irregularity of the
supply of ants' eggs and the birds will only look at live ones, and during
the last week I have had to give mealworms sparingly, a dozen a day..

But the young are now so big I do not think the hen can carry them
about suspended b\ the neck but time will show. Without live ants'
eggs or an abundant supply of aphis flies I do not think Avadavats would
rear their young : and I am not sure the lack of ants' eggs during the
past week has not retarded their growth. To-day, 29th July, I
can see the young in the nest plainly. Their eyes are open, their
beaks are black and the wing-feathers have burst through their quills,
and they should, I think, be out of the nest in a week's time, that is,
three weeks from hatching. Still, even if they should meet with disaster,
I have learned a lot and I would summarize what I have learned as
follows.
These birds should be kept in a little flock of say a dozen so that
they can choose their own mates. The cock bird I separated from its
mate was never afterwards suited. Only one breeding pair can be kept
in a large cage.
The cock is not ready to breed until he has the full red breast.
The hen is not ready to breed until she sings.
Direct sunlight is essential to stimulate the birds to activity.
The large French triple breeding cage is the minimum space the
birds require and the top perches should be placed far apart, one at
each end of the cage, to allow active flight. None of the pairs I kept
in smaller cages showed signs of breeding, yet when I placed all the
odd pairs in a very large flight cage, preparatory to my going away,
one of the cocks showed off to a hen and at once paired with her.
My first nest-building cock had probably found his mate. Lettuce
and small green caterpillars and aphis flies help to get the birds in
breeding condition. On my next leave I hope to breed aphis flies
and the small green caterpillars which infest rose trees, in a green-
house.
Live ants' eggs appear essential to feed the young. The parent
birds will not touch soft food or egg food. They prefer Indian millet
and white millet soaked 36 hours to any soft food. After the first
few days the parent birds used, I think, to feed millet to the young
by regurgitation.
Provided the birds are kept in large flight cages they do not seem
to lose their vigour. In fact, they are most quarrelsome and one cock

bird in breeding condition will keep a whole cageful in turmoil. My
birds were young when caught. They spent the summer, winter, and
spring of 1927-8 in cages, and in the summer of 1928 a hen laid five eggs
and hatched five young.
It is desirable to get the birds into breeding condition as early
in May or June as possible. I have already seen my breeding cock
pair with the hen again so I see no reason why she should not again
go to nest. But if the first young were hatched in August the second
brood would have little fine weather left to grow strong in.
Also I think these tiny Finches must do better inside the house than
in outside aviaries with cats, cold, and rain ; and I remarked one chilly
afternoon when the birds in the outside aviaries in the bird house
in the Zoo showed no signs of breeding, a cock Firefinch inside was
showing off to a hen Avadavat. It might be possible then to breed
these tiny Finches as men now breed Canaries. I, at least, when I have
the opportunity, intend to try.
Since the above was written I have been away, and my birds were
kindly looked after by Mr. Hobbes, of Holloway Aviaries. From his
notes I see that one of the young Avadavats left the nest on 2nd August,
and by the 4th all the four young were flying about their cage. On the
25th the hen Avadavat laid an egg, but as the parent birds became
spiteful towards the young and there was no large flight cage available
for them, the nest and egg were removed.
Owing to the house being unoccupied it was not possible to put the
cage out in the sunlight on the lawn.
Before I left I had placed another pair of Avadavats which seemed
inclined to pair in the only remaining French triple breeding cage I
had. The hen laid one egg, but became egg-bound with the second.
The egg was removed, but thereafter she laid no more. I feel certain
that if it had been possible to place the cage in the sunlight this hen
^ould have laid her full clutch. The four young are strong and well
grown. Their bills are lead-colour and their plumage dull brown. There
are two faint white lines on the wings.
I might mention that the cages I have used were purchased from

Everyone, at least everyone who has the slightest pretension to
be called a naturalist, knows the Pollers, those gay denizens of the
tropics whose colours run through every known shade of blue--sea
blue, sky blue, from the pale blue of the tropical morning to the deep
blue of the tropical night, the blue of every known flower and the blue
of every precious stone.
There are few birds possessed of such a galaxy of harmonious
colours. No wonder then that they are so well known in the tropical
countries of the Old World (for they are absent from the American
continent).
Alas, their beauty, like that of many another of the gorgeously
plumaged birds of the tropics, makes their skins a desirable souvenir
to bring back from the tropical lands when it is stuffed and with a
profusion of dried grasses it is put under a glass shade to reign supreme
in the parlour of many a home where a soldier or sailor son has seen
service abroad and we are told that " Our Tommy was so fond of birds
that he shot this one himself ". And, sad to relate, in the days when
the remains of birds were considered a necessary impedimenta to
women's headgear, tens of thousands of skins of these lovely birds
arrived in this country annually. But I am wandering from my subject,
it is the Poller in the flesh that we want to talk about and not the one
on the parlour cabinet or in a hat--that great blue butterfly-like
creature known to all in the hot climes as the " Blue Jay ".
There are many species of these birds, but, excluding the strange
Ground Rollers of Madagascar, they form a very homogeneous family
with no close allies, though we are told by various authorities that
they have certain affinities to the Bee-eaters, the Kingfishers, and the
Crows.
I forget how many species there are, but all are arrayed in wondrous
garb, some may be sombre but none dull. A large species from
the Philippine Islands is a uniform shade of glorious " cornflower
blue ". In form they closely resemble each other, being about the size
of a Pigeon, with a large head seeming almost too large for the size of

the bird, big expression ate eyes, a fairly broad beak and large butterfly-
like wings, coloured usually with alternate bands of brilliant light and
dark blue ; the tail is usually narrow, sometimes long and sometimes
short, often the outer tail-feathers are elongated and twice the length
of the others, the feathers are also varying shades of blue.
There are few birds possessing such a marvellously light and bouyant
flight and owing to the fact that the Roller spends most of his time in
the air he is not a very good subject for captivity unless he can be
given a large outdoor aviary in the summer and a heated aviary in
the winter where he can exercise his wings, for that is the only form
of exercise that the Roller takes.
The legs and feet are very small, in fact they seem quite out of
proportion to the size of the bird, and it is due to this fact that it
never moves about the trees like other birds and when it settles it
remains stationary and if it settles on the ground it does not walk but
hops in a rather clumsy manner. One usually sees it perched in some
conspicuous position such as the top of a dead tree or a telegraph post
or wire or on the top of an ant-hill waiting and watching for its prey,
for the Roller is entirely insectivorous, slightly carnivorous, feeding
upon all manner of insects, especially locusts, grasshoppers and beetles,
also small lizards and mice ; most of the food is captured in the air.
They cast up pellets of the indigestible portions of their food.
Owing to their structure Rollers should npt be placed in an aviary
too thickly planted with trees but one with a few stout natural branches
of about the same height; this is most essential, because if there is
one much higher than the other the Rollers will stay there and take no
exercise.
Rollers nest in holes in trees, usually rather high up and far out of
reach, they lay four or five glossy white eggs rather like those of a
Parrot.
In captivity they require unremitting care and attention or they
soon begin to look " off colour ".
I have never seen my birds either drink or bathe, but I think that
it is advisable to give them water, for some writers say that they have
seen the birds bathe.
In regard to food Rollers are rather difficult subjects for those

who live in a town ; they require a good insectivorous food, freshly
minced raw meat and fish, but a more natural food is small mice,
which are swallowed whole, beetles, cockroaches, grubs, etc.
I believe that two species have been bred in captivity in this
country and to me this seems a great accomplishment. In a cage
a Roller appears to be an awkward and heavy creature and cuts a
rather pathetic figure, reminding one of a caged Swallow, in fact, I
think that it is gross cruelty to keep any of these birds in cages; in an
aviary where they can indulge in their light butterfly-like flight in
the sunshine and catch passing insects they are happy.
The name " Roller " is given to these birds because of their strange
habit of rolling and tumbling in the air, they behave somewhat like
Tumbler Pigeons, but are much more graceful. Seeing one of these
birds going through its antics for the first time one would think that it
was in some kind of a fit; suddenly turning several somersaults, then
regaining its equilibrium for a second or two, only to go through the
same performance again and again until it is tired, this bird presents
one of the most remarkable aerial feats performed by any feathered
creature. But the voice of the bird surely bears out the common notion
that gaudy plumaged birds have raucous voices (this is not always true,
for some of the brightest plumaged birds are splendid songsters, the
Superb Spreo Starling for instance), but the Roller's vocal accomplish-
ments consist of a series of harsh croaks and a call which somewhat
resembles the " laugh " of the Laughing Jackass of Australia.

Sir, --My three hybrid Sula Island King x Crimson-wing Parrakeets
bred in 1927 have now practically completed their first moult. They
have not changed very much, but the red on the abdomen has run
higher up the breast and they now have a patch of red on the crown.
The parents nested again this year : the .first brood were killed by
the bitterly cold weather in May. The second have just flown. There
is a curious amount of variation in the nesting plumage of the different
families. The first three were green with red thighs and abdomens ;
they are, I think, of both sexes. A single bird belonging to the last brood

ones has red only on the thighs, while the other has hardly any red
at all; just an odd feather or two on the legs. The Alexandra&apos;X
Crimson-wing hybrid, as one would expect from his age, has altered
very little this moult, but he has more pinkish red on the breast and
there is a distinct attempt at a spatule at the tip of one primary in
each wing. He is a very lovely bird and likely to be the only one of
his kind for some time to come, as his father is getting old and infertile,
and the Crimson-wing has had clear eggs this season and last.

Sir, --I have just been reading, in the August number of the
Magazine, Miss E. F. Chawner's interesting account of the successful
breeding of this fine species in Mr. J. S. Lewis's aviary. On looking up
some old notes in my grandfather's ornithological diary, I find that this
Owl was bred in his aviaries at Catton Hall, near Norwich, as long ago
as 1873, though whether the young were actually reared to maturity
F cannot say ; as beyond the fact of the eggs hatching no further
mention of them is made. As the notes in the diary are very short,
I have copied them out, and reprint them here ; the first entry being
for 3rd March, and reads as follows :--
" The Virginian Eagle Owls have certainly two eggs, and the hen
bird has been sitting steadily for 2 weeks." On 30th March there is
an entry which says " saw the Virginian Owl off her eggs to-day for
the first time." 3rd April: " George (the attendant) tells me there
are two young Virginian Eagle Owls."

RENEWAL OF CLAWS BY BIRDS OF PREY

Sir, --With regard to Lord Tavistock's note on page 198,. I have
on several occasions noticed amongst the Birds of Prey kept here
that a broken claw (I cannot say about a beak) may be replaced or
grown again and that, in some cases, fairly rapidly ; an instance has
occurred this summer. I had reason to catch up a large and rather
wild South American Falcon, which was put Into a basket, and taken
to the Norwich Museum for purposes of identification. While there it
was taken from the basket, and during its struggles lost two claws
off one foot, and a single one off the other. Although this occurred only
three months ago, the claws are now rapidly growing again. However, it
is not always the case, for a Kolb's Vulture lost two claws last winter,
I believe from the very severe frost, though its feet were not affected,
and there is no sign of the claws growing again.

almost as large as their parents, and even when they left their original
nest their mother constructed another nest in an empty receptacle
for their sleeping quarters. She took only a few minutes in constructing
this, and I found them all crowded into it at night.
The first nest was a great surprise, for I had just returned from
a four months' tour in Africa and discovered the youngsters when
about to clean out the nest boxes which had been hanging in the open
all through the winter. How African birds could breed and rear
young so early in the year and in such a climate as ours is puzzling to
me. The later nest of five have, of course, appeared under totally
different conditions, having had the recent fine spell in which to mature.
They have had no special attention or feeding, but I have discovered
that all my Lovebirds are extremely partial to bread soaked with
milk. I regret I am not expert enough to sex these hybrids, as the
old-time coon-song asserts " they all look alike to me." As yet they
have not been handled at all. H. Moore.

Sir, --Last year I tried breeding Bengalese in cages, with a view
of using them as foster-parents. They proved most unsatisfactory.
I had two pairs in two cages which I made similar to one in which I
had successfully bred Ribbon Finches a few years before, so they ought
to have been suitable for Bengalese.
Between them they nested about seven times, laying five or six eggs,
on which the hens did most of the incubation and hatched out most
of the eggs; these they concentrated all their attention on. Generally
one, sometimes two, of the young were twice the size of the others,
who were slowly starved to death and had to be removed when
dead. I also found it necessary to clean out the nest and re-line it at
least once during the rearing of what ought to have been a brood of
young birds, but usually ended in a single offspring. Another member
wrote to me that in his case the parents let the young starve as soon
as they left the nest.
If one is going to trust them with valuable eggs, the only way seems
to be to try with several pairs first and then keep any which are capable
of rearing a brood of their own young. H. L. Sich.

Sir, --For the last year or two I have been trying to breed Zebra
Doves. They make a delightful little nest of a very few sticks on a
ledge, lay their two eggs, sit splendidly and eventually hatch out their
two chicks, wdiich grow well and become fully feathered and seem to
be well cared for till they leave the nest and fly or drop on to the saw-
dust covered floor of the aviary. Then one dies off and then the other.
Now can any reader help me with advice as to feeding ? The old Birds
get access to Canary, millet, Indian millet, and hemp, besides which
I have given them a mixture of broken biscuit and Lark food with
a few ants' eggs through it, but they don't seem to care for it and as
far as I can see never touch it at all. My Barbery Doves bring up their
young all right on ordinary Dove mixture with extra hemp and dry
biscuit, to which I have added, just lately, bread-crumbs as
recommended by Viscountess Grey in her most interesting article
on her aviaries.
W. H. Workman.
[The trouble is that the young birds fall to the ground before they
can fly strongly and the parents refuse to feed them there. Boughs
of trees with plenty of small branches should be fastened just below
the site of the nest, so that the young birds can climb on to these when
first leaving the nest.-- Ed.]

Sir, --I bought from a local bird dealer a Grey Cardinal (P. cucullata)

Underneath it is dark grey, mottled with dirty white. The bird was

fed normally, with a little hemp seed, but not much.
I want to know if it is a melanistic form or an abnormal colouration,
which will disappear at the next moult, provided the bird is well kept

grey and others light grey, but never a bird like this, without any white
at all.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
The Queen of Bavaria&apos;s Connie, though known to aviculture for a
long period, has always been very, rare in. captivity. During the past
few years, however, eight birds have been secured by Mr. Chapman,
four of which are at present living in my collection. The plumage
of the adult is a glorious deep golden yellow, with dark green flight
feathers. The bill -is pinkish white, and the feet pink. Young birds
have more green in their plumage, though there appears no certain
information as to the colour of a nestling in first feather. The Queen
of Bavaria is a typical Conure in all its habits, being possessed of a
horrible voice and a playful disposition. Male and female show great
attachment to each other, and are continually cuddling and caressing
and preening each, other&apos;s feathers. At times they have great games
together, hanging upside down from a slender twig by one foot and
seeing which can push the other off first by the use of the beak and the
free foot. They are very gentle in their play and never nip one another
nor lose their tempers as many Parrots do. The sexes are alike in colour
but the hen is not difficult to distinguish by her smaller and rounder
head.

Queen of Bavarias are not particularly destructive. They enjoy
nibbling a branch but they do not chew up their perches nor destroy
exposed boards in their aviary, nor bite through ordinary wire-netting.
Unfortunately, of all Parrakeets, they appear to be the most prone
to the vice of feather-plucking and with the least excuse. For this
reason they are best fed on a very plain seed mixture, with plenty of
sweet grapes and sweet apple. Birds imported on hemp and sunflower
need to be gradually accustomed to canary seed by slowly reducing the
proportion of the former. One of my hens has been a tiresome, delicate
bird, but I think the species is normally hardy, and could be wintered
out of doors in an aviary with a snug shelter. Two of my birds paired
this summer, and the cock fed the hen, but no eggs were laid. I have
more hopes of the other pair eventually breeding, but they are at
present in importation plumage.
This fine Conure inhabits the North-east of Brazil.

By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E., F.Z.S.
It has always been my desire to visit some good aviaries in
France, and this August I was able to do so. Leaving Le Touquet
by car on the 9th, my friend, M. Delacour, and I started off in the after-
noon and after an easy run of just over three hours reached Cleres in
time for dinner. The country through which we motored was lovely, the
crops of wheat, barley, oats, and sugar beet looked most promising, and
were being harvested in ideal weather. Men, women, and children were
working in the fields, and do so, I believe, from sunrise to sunset. The
roads were in good condition, and delightfully straight for miles. We
stayed two nights at Cleres, in M. Delaeour's old chateau, a perfectly
lovely place, parts of which were built in the fifteenth century. It is
most picturesquely situated in a valley, through which flows a fast-
running stream, and the heights all round are beautifully wooded with
fine beech trees. Here I saw the finest collection of Waterfowl I have
ever seen. There were seventy-five species of Ducks and Geese, among
them the Emperor, Ashy-headed, Ross's Snow Geese, Blue Snow Geese,

were Bennett's Wallabies, Chinese Water Deer, Reeves' Muntjacs,
a fine herd of Black Buck, White Rheas, North American wild
Turkeys, Gibbons jumping from tree to tree, all wandering about at
liberty, and looking most happy and contented, also a flock of fourteen
Egyptian Flamingoes in perfect colour, and pinker than any I have ever
seen; this being probably due to a great quantity of natural food
they get in the stream. There were the following Pheasants at liberty
in the park: Eared Pheasants, Kaleej, Bel's Pheasants, a very tame
Cariama, and a perfect specimen of the Scarlet Ibis in marvellous colour,
</bodyText>

Specifer Peafowl, Jungle Fowl, Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes. In
the aviaries I saw a lovely pair of Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets,
Rock Peplars, Stanley's and Barnard's Parrakeets, also White-breasted
and Donaldson's Touracous, Lidth's Jays, Jay Thrushes, different
Starlings, Blue Magpies, other Jays, Nicobar Pigeons, Renauld's
Ground Cuckoos, Black-headed Fruit Pigeons, Budgerigars, Blue-headed
Pigeons, Metallic Pigeons, White-breasted Ground Pigeons, different
kinds of Japanese Thrushes and Buntings and Uragus in colour, and
different Rails (Rallina superciliaris , Porzana fusca ).
In the Pheasantries there were the following birds : Argus and
Rheinardt's Pheasants, Germain's, Ghigi's, Chinquis, and Malayan
Polyplectrons, Javan and Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, Temminck's, Cabot's,
Satyr Tragopans, Imperial, Edwards', Bel's, Berlioz's, Lewis', Elliot's,

In the bird gallery I saw Motmots, Chaulet's Cissa, a Pileated
Kingfisher and a White-breasted Kingfisher, Superb and Royal
Starlings, Scarlet Tanagers, Finlayson's Bulbuls, and a Fries's Scimitar
Babbler. In some very old ruins there was a lovely pair of Snowy Owls.
The greenhouse of stove plants contained Red-sided Japanese Zosterops,
Arthus's and Blue-winged Tanagers, Pittas, Sunbirds, Sugarbirds.
On the 10th in the afternoon we motored to Madame Lecallier's

house called Chateau de la Villette, where she has a nice park of about
30 acres and a piece of running water. In this place she intends
to keep birds and animals at liberty. She already has a good collection
of Waterfowl, including rare Teal, also Screamers, Demoiselle and
Crown Cranes, White Peafowl, Black Buck, Lesser Koodoos, Yellow-
rumped Duiker and a flock of Soay sheep. In another garden about a
mile from her new house she is completing a large series of aviaries for
Parrakeets, Pigeons, and Pheasants, and more than half the birds have
already been housed there. In this garden, which is fenced in, she has
Black Buck, Barbary Sheep, Fallow Deer, different kinds of Ducks and
Geese, Specifer Peafowl, North American wild Turkeys, different
species of Pheasants, and a very tame Gibbon. In her old house there
are still a large number of birds, including Bartlett's Bleeding-heart
Pigeons, Caniceps (with three young), Chrysias, the very rare Marquesas
Island Pigeons (with seven young), Smith's Bronze-winged, Grayson's
Doves, and Long-tailed Pigeons. The Parrakeets were a fine lot and
included Blue-winged, Yellow-bellied, Yellow-mantled, and Norfolk
Island. Of Finches she had Gouldians, Parrot Finches, and Tricoloured
Parrot Finches. There were thousands of Budgerigars of different
colours, green, yellow, blue, cobalt, mauve and white, all in perfect
condition. She also has some very good Pheasants, including Argus,
Edwards', Bel's, Crestless Firebacks, Germain's Polyplectron, and
Elliot's and Soemmerring's.
On the 11th we started off again at eight in the morning and
after a delightful run of about 170 miles we arrived at Rocheplatte,
the old chateau of Prince Paul Murat, near Pithiviers, Loiret, in
time for lunch. This is a charming old chateau, with a moat all
round it. On the moat we saw a big collection of Ducks and Geese,
and there were some Flamingoes on the canal. In a large wired-in
enclosure close to the house there were Black Buck, Duiker, Soay sheep,
Agouti, Sarus, White Asiatic and Demoiselle Cranes, also some White
Rheas and North American wild Turkeys. In his aviaries he has Pigeons,
Curassows, Guans, and a good many Budgerigars and Finches. We
stayed the night at Rocheplatte, where Prince and Princess Paul
Murat spoilt us with kindness. On Sunday morning, the 12th,we motored
to Bourges, about 80 miles, and were entertained at lunch by Canon

Foucher, a great entomologist. After a sumptuous lunch, he showed
us his wonderful collection of butterflies and insects, and then took us
all over the cathedral, which is considered one of the finest in France.
The stained glass was the finest I have ever seen. After saying goodbye
to our kind host, we left Bourges at 4 p.m. and motored 75 miles to
Limoges, where we stayed the night. The next morning we motored
to Gery, a distance of five miles, and were given a hearty welcome
by Monsieur Decoux, who has a lot of aviaries full of small Finches,
Soft-bills, Pigeons, and Parrakeets. The first aviary consisted of six
compartments with shelters (not heated), and I noticed the following
birds in them: Budgerigars, Barrabands, and Yellow-bellied Parrakeets,
Brush Bronze-winged, Caniceps and Bleeding-heart Pigeons, American
Blue Birds with five young ones. Of small birds, there were Parrot
Finches, Australian Finches, Bose Cardinals, Olive, Blue, and Superb
Tanagers, and Silver-eared Mesias with young. The following were
in eight moveable aviaries : Stanley's and Bauer's Parrakeets with
young ; Budgerigars, Masked and Fischer's Lovebirds, Ornate Lorikeets,
Adelaide, Mealy Bosellas, and several pairs of Pigeons and Doves.
Each aviary contained one pair of Parrakeets, with one pair of Pigeons,
or one pair of Diamond Doves. Another large aviary had a mixed
collection of Doves, including Crested, Blue-headed, and Chrysia, all
breeding, also Red-crested Grosbeaks, Cardinals, and a pair of Scarlet
Tanagers which were breeding. In a series of eight small aviaries
were some Marquesas Ground Pigeons (Gallicolumba rubescens), Peale's
Parrot Finches, Crimson-backed Waxbills, Jameson's Fire Finches
(all breeding), and some Blue-winged Parrakeets. One large aviary
was full of Tanagers, many kinds of Finches, all of which were breeding,
also some Venezuelan Cardinals, Sivas, and Blue Birds.
Seven small aviaries were full of different kinds of Parrakeets.
In his bird room he has some fixed aviaries and cages, containing
Black-cheeked and Nyasa Lovebirds, Spot-billed Toucanets, Zosterops,

rare birds, takes the greatest interest possible in his pets, and it gave
me very great pleasure to see his aviaries.
After a wonderful lunch with Monsieur Decoux, we drove off
to La Roche-sur-Yon, Vendee, a distance of 157 miles. We stayed
the night at the Hotel de FEurope, which was most comfortable,
and we were very well looked after. At nine in the morning of
the 14th we visited Monsieur E. Plocq, who has one large garden
aviary, measuring roughly 100 X 40 ft. The garden is full of
flowering shrubs, with a small pond in the middle, and looked lovely
with delightfully tame birds. As soon as we entered the aviary,
a Shag and several Hoopoes came to receive us, and it was difficult
to walk for fear of treading on these tame birds. The following
birds were kept in this aviary : Cuckoos, Hoopoes, Lesser Pied Wood-
peckers, several species of Warblers, Blue-throats, Nightingales, some
Weavers, Diamond Doves, Wrens, Stilts, Avocets, Swallows, Shore and
Woodlarks. Most of these birds were taken by Monsieur Plocq from
the nest and hand reared. A Hoopoe which settled on his shoulder
he picked up and gave to me, also a beautiful Nightingale. When I
complimented him on the condition and tameness of his birds, he said
"Wait till you see my Swallows ". Two Swallows which were in the
aviary, on hearing Monsieur Plocq whistle, came and settled on his
finger. With these, he walked out of the aviary into the street, when
the Swallows flew away, and were seen flying with dozens of other
Swallows. I thought this would be the end of them, but it was not so.
After we had walked about, and had seen some more birds, M. Plocq
whistled, and the two Swallows flew back and perched on his finger,
and were then taken into the aviary. I believe Monsieur Plocq once
took a couple of his pet Swallows in his pocket to Paris and let them
out in the Bois. After a few minutes' liberty he whistled, and they came
back on to his finger. I must say I was astonished to see the condition
of all his birds, most of them being delicate and hard to rear. They
seemed so robust and happy here. He also had an aviary, with six
compartments, adjoining the garden one, with Malayan Hornbills

some Lesser Egrets, Terns, Ducks, etc. I have never enjoyed a visit
to aviaries more than I did to Monsieur Plocq's, and I really think he
is the most marvellous man with birds I have ever met. He will only
keep difficult things. Madame Lecallier sent him a pair of Blue Birds
in the spring from which to try and breed. He had five grown-up young
ones from them, and there were five more in the nest doing splendidly.
We left Monsieur Plocq at 11 o'clock, after a most interesting visit,
and motored to Angers, where we lunched, and then went to La Fleche,
Sarthe, a distance of about 106 miles from La Koche-sur-Yon. As soon
as we reached the town, the car broke down, luckily near a garage.
Leaving the car to be attended to, we went off to Monsieur E. Pannetier,
who was very pleased to see us and showed us round. In his garden he
has two very tame Yulturine Guinea Fowl in perfect plumage and
condition, also a few Pheasants, Carolina and Mandarin Ducks. In
one large aviary was a mixed lot of Waxbills and Australian Finches,
and a tame breeding pair of Bleeding-heart Pigeons. A dozen small
aviaries, each with one pair of Gouldian Finches,and one pair of Diamond
Doves. All the Gouldians had young in the nest, and some of the young
were flying about, and the parents were nesting again. I have never
seen Gouldians look so happy, in fact, all Monsieur Pannetier's birds
looked in perfect show condition. The aviaries were kept spotlessly
clean, and there was not a single sick bird in the place. Here again there
were the larger aviaries with White Javas, Australian Finches, and
different Pigeons. In a second garden close to his house there were
four aviaries, with Parrot Finches and Rufous-tail Finches, all breeding.
In a third garden, he had eight fine aviaries, full of hundreds of blue,
mauve, and white Budgerigars. All the birds in the aviaries could be
seen from the outside, as none of the aviaries were planted with shrubs.
Monsieur Pannetier very kindly presented me with two pairs of Bleeding-
heart Pigeons, and two pairs of Cuban Finches, also some blue Bud-
gerigars, all his own breeding. This was the end of our visits, and now
we walked back to the garage to see what was happening to our car.
It seems that the ball-race of the near hind wheel was broken, and as
nothing to fit it could be found here, one had to be sent for from London.
In the meantime Monsieur Pannetier came to the rescue, and offered
and in fact insisted on lending us his car to take us to Cleres the next

alternative, we willingly accepted his kind offer. We stayed that night

FOREIGN BIRDS AT LIBERTY :
A NEGLECTED GARDEN ORNAMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98469764" page_id="56186079"  page_num="262" year="" vol="">
By The Marquess of Tavistock
While the ornamental value of foreign Waterfowl has long been
recognized and turned to account, not only by private individuals
but also by public bodies, it is strange how completely the possibilities
of exotic perching birds as garden ornaments have remained
unappreciated and unexplored. This would appear to be partly due
to discouraging first ventures made by people who did not understand
the important matters of right selection of species and right manage-
ment ; partly to an exaggerated estimate of the destructive pro-
pensities of cats, armed neighbours, and hostile British birds.
The keeping of exotic perching birds at controlled liberty is certainly
a science, like gardening itself. There is a right and a wrong way
of doing things in both, the former spelling success, the latter complete
failure. But just as the gardener need not grow discouraged with
gardening because no attractive floral display has followed an attempt
to establish plants in &quot;the wrong soil and in the wrong situation, so
the aviculturist need not think of liberty birds as hopeless because
he or others have failed through going to work in the wrong way.
From the point of view of the liberty aviculturist, England is
blessed with a singular paucity of birds and beasts of prey, and foreign
birds, coming for the most part from regions where both are far more
abundant, are usually pretty smart in avoiding diurnal enemies and
in selecting a roost where climbing prowlers are unlikely to find them.
Generally speaking, cats are not a serious danger. It is true that
a cat of pronounced fowling propensities who is privileged to conduct.

by day, undisturbed operations in the garden, might make the place
rather unhealthy for Fire Finches and newly imported Waxbills still
at the weak and confiding stage and perhaps even for such pronouncedly
ground-feeding Parrakeets as Redrumps. But the nocturnal cat
and the diurnal feline visitor aware that its presence is unpopular
and likely to provoke measures of eviction, is not greatly to be feared;
while to a very large number of highly ornamental birds whose habits
are almost entirely arboreal cats can hardly be said to constitute
a danger at all.
The man with a gun, lamentable as are the crimes he commits
through curiosity, stupidity, and ignorance, is seldom so destitute
of good feeling as deliberately to shoot what he is aware to be the
property of another. Let it be freely known to all your neighbours
that you have exotic birds loose, and it is not likely that you will have
to fear loss from human agency.
The propensity of our wild birds to persecute a bright-coloured
foreigner has also been enormously exaggerated. Rooks and Jackdaws
will very occasionally show an inclination to mob Parrakeets, but a
shot or two will speedily teach them to mind their manners for many
a day. I have never myself known Sparrows to attack Finches,
though I believe there are a few authenticated instances of their
doing so. If ever I were unfortunate enough to find myself in a place
where Passer domesticus was so much above himself I should be
greatly surprised if, with a gun and some traps, I did not reduce him
to order in an uncommonly short space of time. Other British birds
take no more notice of foreigners than they do of each other;
occasionally, perhaps, a Chiff-chaff or Willow-Wren will show an
inclination to chivvy flying Waxbills (possibly the warblers' winter
sport ?), but no serious harm is likely to be done.
A certain amount of suitable cover is, of course, a necessary
condition to success. You can hardly expect the larger Parrakeets
to survive a winter in a garden which does not contain some tall
evergreen trees and shrubs which provide a fairly efficient shelter
in a bad snowstorm. You cannot either expect a large stock of
Waxbills to stay in a place where there is not a certain amount
of dense cover, deciduous and evergreen, while for Weavers a pond

partly surrounded by a tangle of thorns, brambles, or bamboos, is
highly desirable, if not a necessity. People who want the minimum
of trouble in management, expense in upkeep, and risk of loss by
straying, and who desire birds that will give colour to the sober
tints of a winter garden will get satisfactory results by liberating
cocks of mated pairs of any of the following Parrakeets : Pennant,
Adelaide, Yellow-rump, Yellow-belly, Barnard, Bauer, Yellow-nape,
and King. All these species when acclimatized are absolutely
indifferent to cold and will never desert their mates, nor range very
far from the garden which contains them. The hens should be confined
in suitable aviaries, moveable for choice, in a place where the aviaries
will not be unsightly and will yet cause the cocks to show them-
selves freely where they will be most seen. The cocks, before release,
should be trained to the use of a trap feeding-box so constructed
that no wild bird will be able to see the seed from the entrance hole.
This prevents an enormous waste of food. If the owner or neighbours
are particular about their orchards the birds should be confined from
the end of July to the beginning of October, and from the time the
fruit buds begins to swell until the spring foliage appears on the common
trees. Assuming that the cocks are also put with their mates for
breeding this will mean that they are loose from October until about
the end of February, giving to the sombre winter garden a touch of
radiant colour which somehow never looks incongruous nor out-of-
place. Any bird whose mate dies while he is at liberty must be caught
up until she has been replaced ; otherwise he will stray and be lost.
People who are attracted by tiny and dainty forms in a summer
garden, should buy, as soon as the night frosts of May are over, a
number of healthy pairs of the cheap and freely imported Waxbills--
Fire Finches, Lavender Finches, Common Waxbills, Orange-cheeks,
Avadavats, Cordon Bleus, and Orange-breasts. Of these the first
two are very good stayers, the second two usually good stayers ;
Avadavats stay well through the summer, but may leave in October;
while Cordon Bleus and Orange-breasts are a bit uncertain, though
delightful when they do decide to settle down. The birds should
be kept for a fortnight in an aviary with a cosy shelter and an outside
flight and trained to feed on Indian millet from a dish over which is a

kind of dish cover of inch mesh wire netting which admits them but
excludes British Finches. For Lavender Finches and Cordon Bleus it
is sometimes necessary to enlarge slightly a few of the meshes as they
are not quite so slender as the other species. Four or five feeding
places should be arranged about the garden in situations inaccessible
to mice and not within springing distance of an ambushed cat. About
the middle of October the feeding places should be converted into
trap-feeding places and all the birds caught up and sold as acclimatized
specimens, a new lot being bought the following spring.
People who are willing to incur more trouble or expense and find
pleasure in careful observation and management can try their luck
with day-liberty Parrakeets, i.e. species which are liable to be devoured
by Brown Owls and cannot be permitted to roost out with safety.
In this category come Barrabands and Rock Peplars, Crimson-wings
and Redrumps. The two first give pleasure not only by the beauty
of their colouring but also by the amazing speed and grace of their
flight. Cocks of breeding pairs and young cocks of the year are suitable
for release, their training being quite a simple matter. Crimson-wings
are very ornamental and excellent stayers, but their quarrelsome
disposition makes it difficult to have more than one cock of a breeding
pair and his children of the year loose by day. Their propensity for
exploring chimneys also necessitates the placing of moveable caps of
wire netting over these too-seductive openings. A pair of Redrumps
make charming day-liberty birds and are easily trained, but their
unsociable temperament necessitates their reigning in solitary state.
Where Owls are not too numerous, Budgerigars will sometimes
make a pretty show at liberty during the summer months. They should
be released about the time of the Cuckoo's arrival, fed on trap-feeding
trays, and provided with artificial nest-boxes with entrance holes
1J inches in diameter, too small for Starlings to enter. The young birds
must be caught up directly they begin to feed themselves ; otherwise
they stray and are lost; but if kept in an aviary until the following
spring they settle down and become the parents of another generation.
To stop late nesting all the breeding cocks must be caught up early
in August and the hens with their second broods when the latter
have flown.

Orange Weavers are perhaps the most ornamental of all the&quot;
Finches, the cocks in their flame-coloured wedding dress looking lovely
as they flit about a garden. When in breeding condition they are rather
fond of defoliating the shrubs which are their favourite perch, but as they
nearly always select common, hardy plants that receive no permanent
damage, the slight mischief in no way counterbalances the contribution
they make to the beauty of a garden. Weavers must be fed on trap---
feeding trays during the summer, any Sparrows that begin to steal the
food being caught and killed. For the purpose of distinguishing
at a distance Sparrows from hen Weavers a pair of field glasses must be
employed by the person trapping. In some gardens Weavers have a
curious habit of leaving in May for a summer holiday to return again
in August and September. A supply of millet must always lie ready
on the trays to welcome their return, even if many weeks have elapsed
since the last bird was seen feeding. This year the writer released
about twenty Weavers in May. By the end of the month the birds had
practically disappeared. After eight weeks' absence he returned to a
still Weaverless garden. About the end of August a cock in colour
appeared ; then a hen ; then two of three more of either sex till by
mid-September the whole lot were back, apparently with an increase
of young into the bargain.
In the middle of October the Weavers should be fed, by gradual
stages, into the shelter of the aviary from which they were first released,
the inward-pointing wire funnel method being employed to compel
the birds to remain inside for the night. From then onwards until
May the Weavers should be released for the day only and not when the
thermometer is below 42* Fahrenheit unless there be a prospect of
bright sunshine. The funnels should be put in about 12 o'clock when
the days are short and the aviary shelter must be comfortably warm.
With a little extra trouble and expense Waxbills can be kept through
the winter instead of being bought and sold off annually. Lavender
Finches should be treated like Orange Weavers, but, no matter how
tempting the weather, on no account should they or any other Waxbills
ever be allowed to roost out before the first spell of warm nights after
May 15th. They need a rather large shelter or shelters, preferably
somewhat divided up, as they come into breeding condition earlier than

their allies and after the end of April the stronger birds are inclined to
persecute their companions when close confined with them for the night.
Of all very small liberty birds they are the best for combined beauty,
good staying qualities, prolificacy, and, by reason of their insectivorous
nature, utility in the garden. Even the Blue Tit is scarcely as graceful
and commendable, hunting green fly on the verandah roses, as the
dainty little African Waxbill with his sweet, mournful call-note and
plumage of exquisite soft grey set off by a crimson rump and tail.
Fire Finches are the tamest of the Waxbills and the most constantly
in the picture by reason of their habit of frequenting paths round the
house. In hot summers, or rather hot autumns, they are quite free
breeders. The sexes must be separated in October and the hens
confined in an aviary with a heated shelter until hot nights set in after
the middle of the following May. Otherwise they will die from egg-
binding. The cocks in winter can be treated as day-liberty birds on
the lines already mentioned. Cordon Bleus and Orange-breasts should
be wintered like Fire Finches, the sexes being separated ; Zebra Finches,
likewise. Orange-cheeks and Bib Finches can be treated like Lavenders.
Common Waxbills are best confined in aviaries altogether after October
and a sharp look-out must be kept for egg-bound hens in late winter
and spring. Avadavats require similar treatment to Common Wax-
bills. If not caught up in good time they are apt to migrate as
October advances and some care and judgment is needed to get hold
of them before they leave and yet not before their last broods have
left the nest. In addition to beauty of plumage the cocks possess
a very sweet little song. As many " hens " are males out of colour it is
well to buy twice as many brown birds as red ones.
A single pair of Dominican Cardinals and Red-eared Bulbuls can
be kept in a garden as summer-liberty birds, the Bulbuls being trap-fed
on banana. The young of both must be caught up and disposed of
as soon as they feed themselves as the old birds will not tolerate their
presence in the garden once they are independent. Both species have
a brief, sweet song, and the Cardinals are decidedly handsome. They
can be wintered without heat.

By J. Delacour and W. Shore-Baily
Here are included several families of small waders, chiefly
belonging to the Plovers and Sandpipers (Charadriidce ). Although
they actually differ widely they may be grouped together in this
chapter because their requirements in confinement are practically
the same.
Apart from certain exceptions, these small waders inhabit the
vicinity of water and feed on insects, worms, and molluscs. All fly
well and the majority are migrants. They are nearly all hardy in
confinement and should be kept in fairly large aviaries with a shallow
pool and as much turf as possible. They are usually sociable and a
number can be kept in one aviary, which must be cleaned very
frequently, as they soon foul the ground if any quantity are associated
together. Their food should consist of insectivorous mixture, earth
worms, meat, or fish finely chopped, and if possible small crustaceans
and molluscs. Some species will also eat small seeds. If pinioned these
small waders may be let loose in a garden provided that it is enclosed
and safe from cats and other foes. There they will keep themselves
and destroy quantities of insects, thereby rendering great service.
Whether in a garden or an aviary these waders are very ornamental,
thanks to their elegant shapes, beautiful plumage, and pretty and
pleasing ways.
Nearly all our indigenous species have been fairly successfully kept
in confinement. We can only mention them here without describing
them, in order not to prolong this chapter unduly. Any book on
birds will furnish a description of them.
The Stone Curlews ( (Edicnemus) come between the Bustards
and Plovers. They have thick three-toed feet, are nocturnal and
migratory, frequenting chalky or sandy plains, and feed on insects
worms, molluscs, and even reptiles and mice. In confinement they need
a dry and sandy place strewn with stones, where they do well, but their
brown streaked plumage, large yellow eyes, and slow movements
render them somewhat interesting.
Besides the native species (CE. cedicnemus) the following species

may be included in the collection : (E. senegalensis from West Africa ;
CE. histriatus , GE. superciliaris from South America, and Burhinus
grallarius from Australia. This last species has often bred in
confinement in its native country. The Stone Curlews are unsafe with
little birds.
The Pratincoles have very short beaks, rather short legs, long
wings and tails, which last are deeply forked. Their colouring is olive
brown with white under parts. The throat is white bordered by a
black line; the base of the lower mandible is red. They are found
along with Plovers and live well in confinement. Our native species
(Glareola pratincola) is sometimes kept in aviaries, and in Asia we kept
G. maldivarum for a long time on a mixture composed of paste, earth
worms, and little shrimps. Galactochrysea ocularis from the Orient has
been imported.
Coursers are distantly related to Pratincoles ; both have short
and slightly curved beaks, but the former have short square tails and
longer legs. They are insectivorous, and like Stone Curlews inhabit
stony desert places and steppes, they hate damp and must be given
a dry shelter to protect them from cold in winter ; they become very
tame and are extremely pretty. If kept under favourable conditions
they are certain to breed. They require mealworms in addition to soft-
billed mixture.
The Cream-coloured Courser (Cursorius gallicus) is light fawn
coloured with white eyebrows, underlined with black, the flight feathers
are black, and the tail is white tipped. It is found in North Africa
and South Europe.
The following species have been imported : C. coromandelicus from
India ; C. temminicki, Rhinoptilus hicinctus, and R. chalcopterus from
Africa.
The Egyptian Plover (Pluvianus cegyptica) is a scarce bird from
North Africa, found from Senegal to Abyssinia. It has pale grey wings
and tail with black and white marks. Its back, crown and sides of the
head and a pectoral collar are bronzy black; throat and brows white ;
under parts tawny yellow. It has lived in the Zoological Gardens
of London.

Jacanas with short sharp beaks and disproportionately long toes,
living in swamps and running over the lotus and water-lily leaves. In
many particulars they approach Rails. They are remarkably angular
and slight, and in addition have very gaily coloured plumage.
Unfortunately they are very difficult to import and to keep alive.
They require to be kept in an aviary containing pools planted as far
as possible with floating plants and to be fed on minced meat and
insects in quantity as well as the insectivorous mixture. They must
be given heat in winter. Up to the present two or three species have
been imported : the South American Jacana (Jacana jacana ), which
is black with lemon yellow and chestnut wings, red and yellow wattles ;
it is about the size of a small Water Rail.
The Water Pheasant or Pheasant-tailed Jacana (Hydrophasis
chirurgus) of India, Indo China, and the Sonde Islands is larger and
has a long pointed tail, has a breeding plumage of bronzed chocolate
brown variegated with black and white. In winter it turns brown with
black and white ; much duller than in spring, and loses its long tail.
The African Jacana (Actophilus africanus) is mostly rich chestnut
and white and inhabits suitable localities throughout the greater part
of Africa.
Under the term Plovers we will group the whole family of the
Charadriidce, that is to say, besides the true Plovers, we will include
Sand-pipers, Woodcocks, Snipe, Phalaropes, and other related species.
The indigenous species are more usually kept in confinement, for
taken together they are prettier than the foreigners, but we will name
those which have set foot in our aviaries.
The Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) stands confinement about the
best; it is long lived on a diet of soft-bill mixture mixed with chopped
meat and wheat.
The Oyster-catcher (Hcematopus ostralegus) does equally well in
the aviary or the garden and will be found to be very hardy. H.palliatus
from East America has been imported, it is brown above, white beneath,
but has a black head and neck. H. niger from West America is chocolate
brown with black head and neck, and H. unicolor from Australia and
H. moquini from Africa are black.
The Wattled Plovers ( Labivanellidce ) are occasionally imported ;

all the species are exotic. Lobiplura malabarica from India has been
seen in Europe ; it is light brown with white on the wings and ramp ;
the crown of the head is black, as is also a band on the breast; its
under parts are white ; its wattles and legs are yellow, beak black.
Microsarcops cinereus of Asia is pale grey with black markings on
the breast, white rump, and yellow wattles ; Lobivanellus lobatus from
Australia is brown above with wing tips, crown of the head, and back
of the neck black ; the under parts white ; yellow wattles ; red legs
and the wings armed with a spur.
The Spurred Plovers resemble the preceding save in the arrange-
ment of scales on their tarsi.
Sarcogrammus indicus from India is sometimes imported, which
is brown, white, and black, and has red wattles ; Zonifer tricolor from
Australia is also brown, black and white, with small red wattles, yellow
bill, black legs, reddish above the tarsus. Belonopterus cayennensis,
which resembles our Plover on a larger scale, and which is found in
South America ; Hoplopterus speciosus from S. Africa is pearl gray
and black, with a white collar and crown of the head, and black legs.
Hoplopterus spinosus from North Africa and South-eastern Europe
comes over here from time to time ; they have laid in confinement.
The Common or Green Plover (Vanellus vanellus) of Europe and
Asia is delightful in either garden or aviary.
The Crowned Plover (Stephanibyx coronata) of Africa, which is
brown mingled with black and white, legs and beak red, is a charming
but rarely imported species.
The Golden and Grey Plovers (Charadrius and Squatarola) live
very well in aviaries and eat a certain amount of grain. The smaller
species of the genus Eudromias and Mgialitis are more tender, but once
established do pretty well. The pretty M. tricollaris has recently been
imported from South Africa.
The Stilts ( Himantopus ), which are easily distinguished by their
long legs, do fairly well in aviaries. H. melanurus from Brazil and H.
mexicanus from North America have been brought over.
The Avocet (Recurvirostra avocitta) has a remarkable upcurved bill
and webbed feet. It thrives and has even bred in confinement. It
is not very susceptible to cold.

The Curlews (Numenius) do as well in gardens as in aviaries. They
are in shape like the Ibis. The Californian (N. femoralis) has been
imported. An allied species, Mesoscolopax minutus from the Asiatic
Coast of the Pacific and from Australia, has been imported.
The Godwits ( Limosa) likewise thrive and are very ornamental
on lawns.
Redshanks ( Totanus ) are charming and fairly good doers in
aviaries. The Red-footed Redshank (Tringa totanus) has been bred
in confinement.
The Ruff (Pavoncella pugnax) is, without exception, the most
interesting of our small waders. It is easily kept, as it feeds on grain
as well as insectivorous mixture. It is a hardy bird and soon becomes
reconciled to confinement. A quantity may be kept together in an
aviary or a garden and they will never hurt themselves against the wire
and never seem ill or out of sorts. The males in spring develop their
handsome ruffs and breeding plumage, and no two are ever alike,
which is practically unique among birds. Their ruffs may be black,
white, russet grey, or all combined ; even the females differ from each
other, particularly in the colour of their legs, which may be grey, yellow
red, or flesh coloured, which diversity seems even more peculiar than
that of the male plumage. The species is made even more interesting
by the liveliness of the males, who ceaselessly fence together especially
in spring. These are, however, merely mimic combats and they never
hurt each other, for one or other of the birds always gives in soon. Ruffs
have been bred in confinement.
The Knot (Tringa canutus) is very hardy in an aviary and feeds
largely on grain; it becomes very tame, but is liable to panic in the
night ; on this account it is better to clip one wing.
The Sanderling (Caledris arenaria) is like the preceding in
miniature and is more delicate.
All the Sandpipers are strongly recommended, for they feed chiefly
on seed and are charming with their swaying walk. The Dunlin
(Tringa alpina) in particular will live for a long time on soaked
biscuit and corn only, and becomes very tame.
The Common Sandpiper (Totanus hypoleucus) is as easily kept.
The Snipe are not nearly as easy to keep. They need large supplies

of worms and insects as well as vermiform strips of meat. They require
even more than the preceding species, damp earth, grass and mud which
they can probe with their bills.
The Painted Snipe ( Roslratula capensis) has been imported.
The Woodcock ( Scolopax rusticola) is delicate in confinement,
but has been successfully kept for a fairly long time.
The Pharalopes (Phalaropus) . These curious little swimming
waders with semi-palmated feet, and which spend part of the year
on the high seas, may also be kept in the aviary, but with difficulty.
The Seed Snipe constitute a curious family of little South American
waders, having short bills and legs. One species ( Thinocorys rumicivorus ),
a Southern form, has been imported and did well. It was fed on grain,
ants' eggs, and green stuff. These birds require dry and clean earth.
The males are tawny with darker brown spots, forehead, sides of the
head and breast grey blue, throat white, surrounded by two black lines
which join together in the middle of the breast and separate again to
make a band across the breast. The under parts are white washed with
fawn. The female has neither grey blue nor black.
The Sheathbills ( Chionis) are peculiar birds from the Antarctic.
Chionis alba is white with greenish beak and sheathed nostrils. The
beak and webless feet are short, the tail rather long. The bird strongly
resembles a pigeon. The skin round the eyes is bare and covered with
yellowish scales. It feeds on molluscs, seaweed, and eggs. It has been
imported, as has also C. minor from the Kerguelen Islands, which is
smaller and has the skin of the face and beak black. C. alba was
illustrated in the Avicultural Magazine for 1927 (p. 245).

The Blue Touracou now in the Bird House at the Zoo is not only
a very attractive bird in looks and ways, but has unusual scientific
interest, for there is something very old-world and reptilian about it;

not only the deep gape and forwardly placed nostrils, but the way in
which it often sits across several small twigs instead of gripping a single
thick perch. The last time I interviewed it, at the end of September, it
treated me to an exhibition which exemplified the two theories about
the origin of flight. First it ran about the floor flapping its wings or
for a moment or two holding them motionless and expanded : this
would suit those who believe that ratite birds like the Ostrich have
never flown but are developing flight. Then, more than once, it sprang
on to the netting, ran flapping up it for a few feet, and took off in flight
with this start. It is very light on the wing--the lightest flyer of its
size I have ever seen--and on this occasion I saw it do a very nice glide
as well as the usual flapping. So must early birds have flown according
to the view which regards them as tree-creatures which first sprang
from bough to bough and passed into flight through the parachuting
stage in which some creatures such as flying squirrels still remain.
The two saururan or lizard-tailed birds that have been found fossil
appear to me to be true ancestral birds, although it has been objected
that they are specialized on a line of their own, and that their long weak
pinion-bones would not allow of the strain of flapping. This argument
is, I think, unsound, for bats' long wire-like fingers stand the strain
perfectly well, including that of turning in flight, which bats do far better
than most birds. The long pinion-bones of these short-quilled Saururans
have, I must say, always puzzled me, for in living birds long pinions
carry long quills, and short-quilled birds have in some cases, such as
the Toucans, pinions as short as a reptile's forepaw. The fact that
the Saururan's wing-digits are provided with claws bigger than those
on the toes has also puzzled me, for it seems to me unlikely that these
early birds moulted all their quills at once, as has been said, and
needed these claws for climbing at this time. The birds that now moult
in this way and become flightless for a time are not the most primitive ;
ratites do not moult in this wholesale manner, and the birds that do
are generally highly specialized and no doubt comparatively modern
in evolution.
The Blue Touracou, with its flapping run up the wires, has given,
I think, the solution. Bunning up wire-netting is all very well, but it
would take an expert specialized climber like a Woodpecker to run up

a tree trunk with the feet only, unless the trunk were inclined, very
rough, or creeper-clad. So it seems to me probable that the earliest
birds ran up trunks on all fours with the aid of their large-clawed
pinion-digits, just as parachuting mammals do now ; that they used
these claws much among boughs and twigs seems unlikely, as the quills
would be then in the way, though not in ascending the trunk.
This leaves the length of the pinion unaccounted for, but it might
have had some flexibility, the paw-pinion having presumably had the
toes joined only by skin like those of a Kingfisher's or Hornbill's foot.
And it is possible that in the early days of evolution of the pinion length
could only be secured by lengthening the whole segment, the quills
being possibly at that time short. Parachuting birds probably only
had the secondaries well developed, the pinion and its primaries
making the true wing, just as the long webbed fingers do that of the bat.
The shortening of the pinion was no doubt a later economy and consoli-
dating process, just like the compression of the long chain of tail-bones
into the modern " Pope's nose The modern tail is not only handier
and lighter, but if seized is apt to part with its feathers, whereas a
Saururan, if seized by its lizard-like tail, was no doubt a lost bird.
The most primitive living bird in its anatomy is the Ostrich,
which not only is the only one with the hip-bones joined below as in
reptiles, but has two claws on the wing throughout life, and the pinion-
skeleton so like a paw in its digits that a few strokes of a bone-saw
between the second and third of these would make a paw of it.
Nevertheless, I do not believe that Ostrich and Co. are ancient
amateur aviators. The Ostrich at speed is said to drop its wings and
not use them, the Rhea only raises one as a sail, and Darwin's Rhea
not even that. That the patagium or web in the front of the wing is
wanting in the ratites, and also the interlocking mechanism in the
feathers, is no argument that these birds never had such structures.
The hind-toe has disappeared in many birds, but only in Albatrosses
has any trace of it been found, and the reduction of the webs in many
Waterfowl show that these skinny expanses are unstable.
The ratites are admittedly the most ancient living birds, and so they
have had a longer time in which to degenerate than other flightless
kinds.

276 F. Finn--The Blue Touracou and the Beginnings of Flight
It is a pity that we have no pre-Saururan fossils showing a stage
intermediate between feathers and scales, for feathers certainly make
the bird ; but important links like this always are missing--there are no
fossils intermediate between bats and other mammals, or pterodactyls
and other reptiles, for instance.
It has been suggested that such important intermediates were local
and hence not likely to be found ; this seems reasonable, for a type with
new means of locomotion would soon spread. Bats are very widely
diffused and common, but the Cobego (Galeopithecus), which, though
not a link, comes nearer to them than does any other parachutic
mammal, only exists as two species in a few East Indian islands.
The link, too, may have been widely diffused but not so abundant
as the specialized form. The Moorhen, now, is a very perfect link in
habits between land-birds and water-fowl, the Coot a complete water-
bird. But though the Moorhen, allowing for subspecies, is found in
all quarters of the globe, it is not sensationally abundant like some of
the Coots, of which the species are also far more numerous. Thus,
if both Moorhens and Coots became extinct, the latter would be far
more likely to be found fossil. Moreover, the link may have been
short-lived as evolution goes, and soon superseded by its specialized
descendants, just as the old square-fronted motor built on the lines of
the horse-vehicle was only to be seen for a few years.
The TouracoUs, especially the large blue species, show us, I think,
what the earliest birds were like better than any others living, both
in form and movements. Their skeletons may not be particularly
primitive, but external form and movements may at times remain the
same, while anatomy alters ; thus lizards and the more primitive tribe
of newts are very much alike, though their anatomy differs widely,
and rats, specialized as rodents are, no doubt retain the general form
of the earliest mammals.

Apart from the rearing of a young Virginian Eagle Owl already
recorded in the Avicultural Magazine, this has not been a successful
season at Wargrave. A good number of birds showed signs of wishing
to breed, but failed from one cause or another. As, however, Owls
are not often kept under conditions which make for breeding it may be
of interest to give a list of species which attempted to propagate their
species though they did not succeed.
European Eagle Owl. Three eggs laid and all hatched; the third
nearly a week after the others. All went well for six weeks and a
plentiful supply of rabbit was given twice daily. But just as the
nestlings had begun to feather and were using their wings they all
" went light " and died in a few days.
Turcoman Eagle Owl. Dug two " scrapes " and the hen occupied
both in turn but did not lay.
Ural Owl. As these were under a year old they were not expected
to nest, but a European hen mated to a Chinese cock laid one egg and
incubated it steadily. The egg was infertile, owing no doubt to the
youth of the birds. Complete success may be hoped for next year, as
both birds are clean moulted and in first-class condition. They went
to nest in a large barrel.
The Bed Sea Little Owl (Carina noctua spilogaster) dropped an
egg from its perch and seemed inclined to nest in a barrel, but nothing
more came of it.
White-eared Scops (Otus leucotis granti) became very savage and
laid four eggs in a nest box. Both birds were continually at the nest,
and it is believed that one egg hatched, but if so the nestling either died
or was killed by its parents. The other eggs were infertile. The cock
was very anxious to try again, but the hen steadily refused.
European Scops (Otus giu). Two eggs laid in a barrel and the
hen incubated them for just on three weeks, then was found dead in
the flight. For some unknown reason a large and apparently normal
casting had gone to the vent which it was unable to pass. Both eggs

were fertile, one would have hatched in a couple of days; the other
perhaps a week later.
Burrowing Owl (Speotyto cunicularia). Two eggs laid above ground
in a hollow. One hatched in three weeks and two days. The hen
alone incubated and was so unsteady that there seemed little prospect
of any result, but one chick appeared, a very lively little bird much
like a white Bantam Chicken. Unfortunately it was trapped next day
in a burrow and smothered by the well-intentioned digging of its parents,
who were sorely distressed at losing it. The other egg was infertile.
Striges from the West Indies, Brazil, and Madagascar all went to
nest. The West Indians laid ten eggs between them, but both being
hens naturally nothing came of them.
The Brazilians and Madagascans are still (9th September) sitting on
about six eggs to the clutch laid in the usual Strix fashion of two eggs
and a pause, two more and another pause, and so on. It is thought
that some eggs are fertile in each case. It may be of interest to note
that all these Barn Owls have chosen to lay on the bare ground though
provided with barrels, boxes, and baskets. The hens sit very closely,
the cocks do not take any part beyond threatening intruders with
voice and gesture.
The notable event in the newly started aviaries at the Odney Club
Estate (Cookham) is the rearing of a young Occipital Hunting Pie
(TJrocissa occipitalis).
The pair had already begun to nest at Wargrave when it was
decided to move them to Odney, but nothing daunted they began a
fresh nest within twenty-four hours. Three young were hatched but
only one lived to grow up, the parents ate the others before they were
fledged although regularly supplied with animal food such as mice.
Sparrows, frogs, etc.
The surviving youngster is now nearly as large as its parents and
fully feathered.
Eight young Long-tailed Grass Finches and any number of Bengalese
have been reared and Superb Starlings have well-feathered young nearly
ready to fly. Three young Monauls were reared under a hen, but the
Tragopan and Javan Jungle Fowl's eggs were infertile.

Nearly two years ago I received a pair of these handsome birds
in exchange from the Lilford Aviaries.
They were placed in one of my aviaries in which Eagle Owls had
been formerly kept. This aviary was a fairly roomy one, as it was
30 ft. X 10 ft. X lb ft. high. But it had no natural cover. Last season
they played about at nesting, but nothing happened, and it looked as
if similar results would be secured this year.
Towards the end of June I had a welcome visit from our member,
Mr. Gerard Gurney, and on my calling his attention to the Coucals, he
told me that in East Africa he had found the allied species nesting
freely in the swamps. After this information I decided to transfer
the birds to one of my Waders' aviaries, containing a number of Rails.
These the Coucals promptly went for, driving them from pillar to post.
I succeeded in removing two of them, a Cayenne and an Ypacaha, the
others evaded capture, and I have not seen or heard them since, and
the only thing that makes me believe them to be still alive is that their
food disappears at night. Thoroughly masters of the aviary, the Coucals
at once started nest building, choosing a thick thorn hedge on the edge
of the pond as a nesting site. A large nest of twigs was made, something
like a Pigeon's, but about 6 inches deep. Three nearly round white eggs
about the size of Barn Owls' were laid. After the hen commenced
sitting, the cock domed the nest, with other twigs and roots. Both
birds shared the incubation, the cock by day and the hen by night.
The eggs, proving infertile, were deserted, and another nest commenced,
this time in a dense clump of bullrushes. This was about the size of
a large football, and was a much more finished structure, being com-
pletely domed before the first egg was laid. Sticks and rushes were
the material used, rendering the interior completely watertight. Three
eggs were again laid, and both birds sat well after the third egg was
laid on 21st July. On 8th August I noticed the hen off the nest, and
on looking in saw one young bird probably a couple of days old. It
was in colour bluish-black covered sparsely with a long white down.

Both the old birds, the hen especially, now began to lose a great deal of
their shyness, and would meet me at the door of their aviary, asking for
food. They have a curious habit of raising one wing and then the other
over the back and I notice that the young bird also does this. For
food we gave them all the mice and Sparrows we could get and when
these were not forthcoming raw meat. Biscuit meal and bread and milk
were also provided, but I think that this was not given to the young
bird. On 15th August the youngster was about the size of a Blackbird,
and still covered with long white filaments. A week later it had grown
to the size of a Jackdaw ; its head and shoulders were still ornamented
with white filaments which stuck straight up on end as it looked out
of the entrance hole of the nest, giving it a somewhat alarming
appearance. On the 28th it left the nest and disappeared into the dense
reeds, which it appeared to negotiate as easily as a Moorhen. In colour
its under parts were dark blackish-grey, the wings and upper parts
bright reddish chocolate, every feather lightly barred, making it a
really pretty bird.
I believe that this is the first time that this species has been bred
in captivity in England.

Sir, -- I have a brood of four young Pennants which are interesting
in that no two are coloured alike. One cock and hen are mainly
green with a little red on the throat, breast and fore part of the crown ;
the other cock and hen are mainly red with a little green on the mantle.
The green cock is also redder on the rump than the green hen and the
red cock is bluer on the mantle than the sister that most resembles him.
I have had a brood of young Pennants all of which were wholly
crimson in nestling plumage, and another aviculturist records a pair
which had some crimson and some green young in each brood. It is
therefore evident that P. elegans is in the very middle of evolving from
a bird whose young have a primitive green dress into one where the
green dress is dropped and adult plumage taken on from the nest.

CUCKOOS AND GOOSEBERRY SAW-FLY LARViE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998427846153846" page_id="56186106"  page_num="281" year="" vol="">
Sir, --This year many of our gooseberry bushes have been badly
affected by the larvae of the gooseberry saw-fly. These are objectionable
greenish caterpillars which appear in great numbers--in some cases
entirely stripping the bushes of their leaves and exposing all the fruit
to view ; this in turn has been attacked by Song Thrushes and Black-
birds, though neither of these birds ordinarily do a great deal of damage
to gooseberries, except in very dry weather.
It is generally believed that the larvae of this saw-fly are unpalatable
to insectivorous birds. During the dry spells at the end of July a strange
visitor to our garden was seen to dash out of the bushes on hearing the
crunching of footsteps on the gravel path. It was a Cuckoo. The
question arose--was it after gooseberries or caterpillars. As the weather
was very hot and dry we suspected it was the fruit; unfortunately

the bushes are so situated that it is impossible to observe what the
bird was doing. It was continually there ; after being disturbed it
would make a circuit of the garden and reappear as soon as all was
quiet. We afterwards discovered there were two of them, though they
were never both in the bushes together. After all the gooseberries
had been gathered they still continued to come, which I think definitely
proved that they were after caterpillars and, further, one was seen in
some young bushes which had had no fruit on them, but which were
covered with larvae.
Much as I was pleased to be able to add another good mark to the
Cuckoo's character, I cannot say,however, that I welcomed their presence
in the garden, for they created a " state of nerves " among the aviary
birds. In one aviary, not far from the bushes, a flock of various-coloured
Budgerigars would be contentedly feeding on a heap of seeding-grass,
when a Cuckoo would flash past on his way to the bushes. There
would be one terrific whirr of wings and the whole flock would hurl
themselves into the inside house, where they would sit motionless and
silent for quite a considerable while ; a curious thing about these
sudden alarms was that in this aviary there are two cock Cockatiels,
usually the most " panicky " of Parrakeets, but they were the least
affected birds. The Budgies doubtless mistook the Cuckoo for a Hawk,
and its sudden appearance over the wall and rapid flight past their
aviary must have been very terrifying to them.
Even now after the Cuckoos have left there is a noticeable nervous-
ness amongst the Budgerigars. It only requires an old cock Sparrow
to give his short chirping alarm, or a Robin to " wheeze " to send the
whole lot inside in a second.

<bodyText confidence="0.970514090909091" page_id="56186118"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The handsome Barbet which forms the subject of our coloured
plate is one of a large genus all of which are African. As its specific
name (Lybius abyssinicus) implies, it is confined to north-east Africa,
and it was unknown to aviculturists until quite recently, when several
arrived with a collection of Abyssinian birds. So far it has not been
bred in captivity, but there should be no great difficulty in inducing
it to do so. It breeds in hollow tree-trunks after the manner of a wood-
pecker, and a log nest should suit it.
These birds thrive on a diet of good insectivorous food, with the
.addition of fruit and insects. The sexes are alike.

By J. Delacour and W. Siiore-Baily
Kails are very interesting to the aviculturist. They are all pretty
birds, more or less aquatic, and their long toes are well adapted to
walking on floating herbage, climbing reeds and bushes. They live on
insects and small animals, shoots and seeds. They are mostly hardy
and easily kept, also readily induced to breed in confinement. The draw-
back is that they are spiteful to each other and to other kinds of birds.

In fact, very few of them can be kept safely with small Passerines, unless
their aviary is very large, even then they would probably destroy any
fledglings as soon as they left the nest. It is accordingly wiser to keep
them separately or with such birds as are strong enough to protect
themselves. They will also devour eggs, and it is unsafe to let them
loose in a paddock with nesting birds for this reason.
The Water Kail (Rallus aquations ), of Europe, is very pretty and
not dangerous to small birds, being wholly insectivorous. R.
longirostris, from Guiana, has been imported ; it is olivaceous, with
brown spots above, isabelline beneath, and its flanks are barred with
ashy brown and white. R. abhotti, from Assumption Island, has also
been brought over ; it is greyish brown above, the head and under-
parts chestnut. The throat and upper chest are white, the abdomen
black with white markings. These Rails have long, thin, bills.
The Limnopardalis , of South America, are near relatives of the
preceding; L. maculatus and L. rytirhynchus have been brought to
Europe.
The Hypotcenidia have shorter bills.
The Pectoral Rail {H. philippinensis), of Australia, has several
times bred in aviaries. It is like our Water Rail, but has a tawny yellow
pectoral band. H. brachypus, also of Australia, is smaller and duller.
H. celebensis, of Celebes, has a black throat barred with white. H.
striata, south-east Asia, is brown, with slaty grey neck and breast,
and flanks streaked with black and white. All these birds are easily
managed in confinement, and are occasionally imported.
Cabalus sylvestris from Lord Howe's Island, is a rar&amp; species, red
brown above, slate beneath; it has been shown at the Zoological
Garden of London.
Eulabeornis castaneiventris, from Australia, is large, olive-brown
above, vinous beneath ; the head and back of the neck are grey, the
bill is green. E. pcecilopterus, of the Fijean Isles, is smaller, only the
front of its head is grey.
Tricholimnas lefresnayanus, from New Caledonia, has silky plumage
and the wing-coverts very long ; it is brown above, grey beneath.
The Green-billed Rails (Aramides) of South America, come over
fairly often. They are large birds, rather like the above, but with shorter

tails. They live well and breed freely in confinement, but are unsafe
with other birds and destroy their nests. They become very tame ;
the males fight perpetually after the fashion of cocks, and when one
gains the upper hand it chases the other round the aviary without
ceasing ; which appears to amuse them. Their call is a loud, rather
pleasing whistle, which can be heard from afar. They are hardy, but
in severe winters their feet may get frozen, and they are safer in shelter.
Azara's Rail (A. chericote), which is found in Brazil and Colombia,
has an ashy-green mantle and part of the wings, the rest is a
fine chestnut-red ; the head and neck are grizzled, the nape is brown,
and the chin blue ; the tail, lower back, and belly are black, legs pink,
bill green at the tip, orange at the base.
The Cayenne Rail (A. cayanea) is very similar, but has a grey nape.
The Mexican Rail {A. albiventris) differs only in having a browner
nape and the lower breast whitish.
The Saracura Rail (A. saracura ), from Brazil, is distinguished
by its slatey grey under parts.
The Ypacaha Rail (A. ypacaha) is larger than the preceding
species. It inhabits Southern Brazil and the Argentine. Like the
above, it has a green mantle, russet wings, and black tail; but in
addition its upper neck and head are rosy fawn ; its cheeks, front of
the neck, and breast light grey, its throat white. Its under parts and
sides are rosy fawn. It is a dangerous bird, and is best kept by itself ;
it is bold and daring.
The Weka Rails ( Ocydromus ), of New Zealand, are large terrestrial
birds and semi-nocturnal, chiefly inhabiting woods. They hide during
day in holes or in cavities which they have dug for themselves. Their
beaks and legs are short and their plumage is brown. They closely
resemble gallinaceous birds. At one time they were freely imported
and they bred readily in confinement, but now they are very rare.
There are three closely allied species : 0. australis , from South Island,
which is yellowish-brown streaked with dark brown, having the eye-
brows, cheeks, throat, and lower breast grey, and striped sides ; 0.
brachypterus, from the same locality, very closely allied ; and 0 . earli
rather darker, from North Island.

imported, and doubtless several species of Rallina from Asia and
Oceania, little short-beaked Rails usually russet, black, and white.
The Land Rail (Crex crex ) is well known among us, and generally
distributed ; it has bred in confinement. It is an interesting bird, but
unsafe with small birds, such as Larks.
The Crakes ( Porzana ) are small Water Hens, charming and harmless
in an aviary. Two European species, P. porzana and Baillon's Crake
(P. pusilla) and the Carolina Crake from America are often kept in
confinement.
Ortygops notata, an Argentine species, is occasionally imported ; it
is nearly related to the preceding genus. Its plumage is chocolate, with
black and white spotted centres to the feathers. The under parts
whitish with brown spots.
The Cayenne Rail ( Creciscus cayennensis) , from Brazil and Guiana,
has recently been imported several times. It is chestnut-brown above
and bright russet underneath, with red eyes and legs. A pair in
Captain Stokes' aviary built a large spherical nest of dry grass in a bush
about a yard above the ground, but did not lay. These birds live on
soft food and corn, and are liable to become overfat.
Limnocorax niger is a miniature black Water Hen, with yellow bill
and red legs ; is occasionally imported. It has laid in confinement.
Neocrex erythrops , from South America, is another little Water Hen,
olive brown, having pale grey forehead, sides of the head, and under
parts ; its sides and abdomen are dark brown with white stripes.
Mortier's Water Hen (Tribonyx mortieri ) is a large Water Hen,
olive-green above, blackish grey beneath, with white sides and black
tail, green bill and legs. It is found only in Tasmania, where it is known
as the Native Hen.
The Black-tailed Water Hen ( Microtribonyx ventralis ), of
Australia, is a most attractive species, with upstanding tail, like a
bantam-hen, and red legs. It has bred in the London Zoological
Gardens, but is, unfortunately, very rarely imported.
The rare Porphyriornis nesiotis, from Tristan da Cunha, has also
been imported. It is black, with a little white on the sides and sub-
caudal feathers. It has a red bill, with a yellow tip, and its legs are
yellow.

The true Water Hens ( Gallinula) are all like our own species. G.
tenebrosa, from Australia, and G. galeata, from America, have been
brought over.
The Crested Water Hen (Gallicrex cinerea), of Asia, differs only
in having a fleshy top-knot and in being larger.
Allen's and the Martinique Porphyrios ( Porphyriola alleni and
martinica), the former from Africa and the latter from America, are very
pretty little Water Hens, with blue and green hues. They are very
delicate in winter.
The Porphyrios or Imperial Hens (Porphyrio) are magnificent
birds, easily recognizable by their largely blue colouring, thick bills,
with red frontal plate and their large feet. They are powerful birds, and
with the exception of certain species, require protection in winter.
They breed rather readily in confinement, but must be watched lest
they destroy eggs or small birds, for they are not to be trusted.
The Blue Porphyrio or Purple Gallinule (P. coeruleus), a
Mediterranean species, is wholly blue. It is hardy. The Green-backed
Porphyrio, P. porphyrio , of Africa, has a green mantle. It is one of
the most beautiful, the hardiest, and most powerful species.
The Grey-headed Porphyrio (P. poliocephalus), from India, is
blue, with greenish wings and pale grey head. It is not very hardy, and
is liable to get frozen feet.
Edwards' Porphyrio (P. edwardsi), from Indo-Cochin, is like the
above, but has a black mantle.
The Black-backed Porphyrio (P. melanonotus), from Australia,
is the hardiest, it is blue with black head and back.
The Coots (Fulica) are distinguished from all other Rails by their
short legs and lobed feet; they are very aquatic. Everyone knows our
common Coot (Fulica atra). Several foreign species have been imported.
The Crested Coot (P. cristata), of Africa, with its frontal plate
ornamented with dark-red excrescences.
The Australian Coot (P. australis), with grey blue legs and bill.
The Slaty Coot (P. ardisiacea), of Peru, and the neighbouring
countries, grey with greenish lights above, black head and neck, yellow
bill; and P. armillata, from Argentine and Chile, which differ only
by having a higher frontal plate and red at the base of the culmen.

the above, but is darker, and has a yellow frontal plate.
These various Coots often figure in Zoological Gardens, and have
not yet been bred in Europe, but doubtless they easily could be. They
are harmless to other birds, and very easy to keep alive.

A few notes on the behaviour of a Thrush (Turdus ?nusicus) may
be of interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine.
The Thrush (seemingly about three weeks' old) was found in the
road, and, as it was in danger from vehicles and prowling cats, it was
picked up, brought into the house, and fed. No attempt then or
afterwards was made to prevent it from going away if it wished, but
it paid no attention to the outside world, and if it ever looked out
of a window or door it did so with indifference. It was quite unafraid
when picked up, and, indeed, soon began to show a thirst for human
companionship truly astonishing. If we left a room, it followed,
keeping pace. If it was left alone in a closed room for a few minutes,
it greeted the first person who entered with a succession of chirps,
uttered so loud and fast as to sound like a long scream, running to
him and jumping on and around his feet in such a way as to put its
limbs in danger. I disliked the thought of confining the creature in
any way, and I suppose I let it have more liberty than it ought to
have had. It quickly made itself free of my library, for example,
where, as may easily be imagined, its presence was not conducive
to cleanliness, and it even went so far as to make a daytime resting-
place on the tall vellum folio volumes of my copy of the Opere of that
most learned old Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Bembo. But much had
to be forgiven to such a bird, and Chippie (as he was named) went
unrebuked.

Henry Neal Milligan--On the Behaviour of a Tame Thrush 289
I soon saw that Chippie had a way of paying marked attention
to whatever happened (a great point, the value of which is well under-
stood by all experienced animal keepers). He observed steadily,
and seemed to be storing things in his memory. I believe that in his
way he was a great experimental philosopher, perhaps a sort of avian
Darwin, for he could not even be on the breakfast table (as he usually
was) without turning objects over and examining them minutely,
and once, having looked hard at a cup of tea and found it puzzling,
he deliberately sat down in it. He would walk round a singing kettle,
and chirp to it. He was fond of sitting on the edge of a wash-tub
during laundry operations, chirping rapidly, and seemingly enjoying
the heat and steam. (I notice that the dear old naturalist-hero of
our young days, the Rev. J. G-. Wood, whose first-hand observations
are always good, mentions this steam-loving peculiarity of a thrush.)
And Chippie well knew how to amuse himself. Always at about
four o'clock in the afternoon (Parliament time) he began to rollick,
dancing on the floor and chirping incessantly. Then he would take
it into his head, perhaps, to fly up to a pin-cushion, taking out the
pins one by one, and accumulating them under a certain chair ; or
he would tug and tug at a carpet; or he would turn out the contents
of a work-basket, and play with the reels of silk and balls of wool ;
and sometimes he would sit on a maid's lap in the kitchen and tug
persistently at her apron. He loved to play with lace. (The Rev. J. G.
Wood mentions that a Thrush carried off a lace cap, which it built
into its nest.)
But Chippie's chiefest delight was in a five-foot tape-measure.
If somebody trailed the tape along the floor, going thus along passages
and from room to room, Chippie followed, uttering loud cries, pecking
all the way at the tape, and occasionally trying to jump on it. At
such times his behaviour strongly resembled that of a kitten ; indeed,
people who saw the bird usually commented first on its amazing
familiarity and then on the resemblance of its behaviour to that of a
domestic mammal. (Chasing the tape-measure had nothing to do
with hunger : the bird played as readily after food as before.) My
wife, who was perhaps Chippie's favourite (for he made distinctions
between persons), was in the habit of pretending to " tickle his ribs ",

an action which he obviously enjoyed, and at intervals she would say,
in a mock-threatening voice, " I'll have that old beak, I will, I will,
I will ! " Then she took hold of his beak, and gently pulled it, and
Chippie would dance away, and then return to begin the game afresh.
The bird was terrified of goldfishes, and would never go near them.
It showed marked fear of the slough of a grass-snake, and also of a
Pacific Island necklet of yellow shells. It seems remarkable that it
feared the slough and the necklet but not the snake-shaped tape-
measure. In the course of its gambols it once arrived in front of a
vivarium, in which, near the glass front, there were two toads. The
bird stopped, and stared. The toads, startled, suddenly raised them-
selves high on their legs and puffed out their bodies, in their
characteristic " warning " way, and the bird at once leapt backwards.
The defensive value of the toads' " warning " was here very clearly
demonstrated ; though the bird quickly learned that the toads could
not reach or hurt it. I may add that Chippie was almost certainly
a male.
It will readily be believed that Chippie was in request, and as for
various reasons I found it difficult to keep him, I let him go to a kind
home where I knew he would have his accustomed freedom. I am
told that his latest humour is to swing by his beak from a dresser-
hook, and that a light-minded hen Canary, neglecting the mate provided,
makes point-blank love to him.
In the foregoing notes I have not thought it needful to mention
details, such as those of food and feeding, which will be known to all
readers of this Magazine, but only those points which seem worth
recording. The point to which I wish to direct chief attention is,
that this thrush is evidently one formed wholly for human society.
It is curious to speculate upon what sort of a race of domestic Thrushes
might be evolved if breeding were carried on with one or more pairs
of birds so endowed.

I have had a pair of Palm Cockatoos in my collection for about a
year. In the spring they were turned into a large aviary, but they
have been so shy and secretive, spending nearly all their time in the
shelter, that, like the child's guinea-pig, one might almost have said
of them that they " had no habits This afternoon, however, they
were both in the flight and the hen, who is now in perfect plumage,
began to make advances to her companion. With her crest partly
erect, she walked up to him in a jaunty manner, and when quite close
puffed out the feathers of her breast. She then faced in the same
direction as the cock and stamped with either foot alternately, posturing
and bowing and cocking her head in a ridiculously affected manner
which she evidently considered very becoming. The performance
was enlivened by two distinct calls--a kind of snarling croak and a
crescendo scream which I can only describe as indistinguishable froip.
that uttered by a housemaid engaged in badinage with her swain.
During the performance the bare skin on the hen's face became a
much deeper pink. The cock, who is not in quite such good plumage
as his companion, did not respond to her advances, but made no attempt
to drive her away. The Palm Cockatoo is at the best of times a very
odd-looking creature, and its courtship is more comical than that of
any other bird I have watched with the exception of the Little Owl.

Two years ago my Bay Cowbird hen mated with a cock Brown-
headed Starling, and fertile eggs were produced. Last year I provided
the Cowbird with a male of her own species, and she went to nest
two or three times, but the eggs in every case but the last laying were
infertile, and these I unfortunately removed without examining until

too late. This year, her mate having died in the winter, she reverted
to her old love, the Starling. He built her a typical Troupial nest in
an ivy-covered conifer. The Cowbird's own nest is a shallow cup
like a small edition of that of a Blackbird, whereas the Brown-headed
Starling's is a deep cup, suspended from three or four ivy stems, and
much more compactly woven. In this nest four eggs were laid, all
of which duly hatched some time in May, only to disappear three or
four days later. They went to nest again early in June, the Starling
again building the home. Once more the young hatched, and my
hopes rose high, but once more they disappeared when only a few
days old, this time, I think, the victims of either a weasel or a rat.
These vermin caused us a lot of trouble in the aviary at this time,
killing, amongst other birds, two large Tinamous, whose size should
have rendered them safe. Not daunted by their failures they again
went to nest towards the end of August, and young were again hatched
early in September. The weather at this time was very fine, and the
little ones grew well. The old birds appeared to be feeding them
mainly on crawling insects, which I supplemented with mealworms.
With so many other birds, hungry for mealworms, in the aviary, this
was rather difficult to manage, but I finally arranged it by suspending
a shallow box near the nest, into which I put a few worms several
times a day. The cock, although I have never seen him feeding the
young, took good care to see that no other birds came near them or
the box containing the mealworms. On 11th September the young
left the nest, although neither could yet fly. The old birds became
very agitated, and attacked everything big or small that came near
the little ones while they were on the ground, a pair of Cayenne Plover
getting a particularly rough time. In two or three days the young
birds were able to fly a few yards, and took up their home in a thick
laurel, and at the time of writing they are quite strong on the wing.
In colour they are a dirty brown, with white wings, giving them a
rather curious appearance. If they survive the winter it will be
interesting to see which of their parents they most resemble after their
first moult.

Before the war, at Villers-Bretonneux, I used to grow a number
of orchids and stove plants in four special hot-houses. It had long
struck me that conditions which suited tropical plants, i.e. constant
heat and dampness, should also suit the delicate birds which live among
these in their native countries. At Villers I had for a time a small
aviary, about 4 by 2 feet, built in a corner of an orchid house. I kept
there with some success a few tropical Finches and small Tanagers,
but the latter did not live very long, dying in fits of apoplexy, due to
lack of exercise through insufficient space. After the destruction
of my birds and plants in Picardy, I could not afford to take up hot
houses any more, and until last summer one greenhouse which existed
at Cleres was left empty. During my stay in the Far East last year,
I suddenly thought that I could make use of it without much expense,
altogether to grow some of my favourite stove plants and at the same
time to experiment in a new way of keeping delicate tropical birds
such as small Tanagers, Sugar Birds, Sunbirds, and Pittas.
As soon as I arrived home, I had the greenhouse done up, new pipes
laid in to increase the heat, and I undertook to make of it a small
tropical garden.
The house is built on a wall facing south and is 40 feet long and
10 feet wide. All windows and straight pieces of glass were wired
over, and a wired partition put up 12 feet from the entrance door,
thus leaving a compartment that people could enter, with chairs to
watch the birds in the next part of the house without disturbing them.
Both compartments were laid out as miniature and old-world
gardens, with pools, paved paths, and dry walls, while some artificial
trees made of cork bark, in the entrance, enabled us to dispose orchids,
bromelias, and other epiphytic plants as naturally as in their native
lands. With the exception of some ornamental vases, no pots what-
soever can be seen in the house, tropical plants being planted in the
walls and on the top, as in an outdoor garden, while the walls are
covered with creepers. The pond is planted with blue water-lilies
and other aquatic beauties, and Japanese and Chinese long-

tailed fishes swim among them. Now that all was planted
and beginning to grow beautifully, the question was which
birds to try, which would live, and which would not damage
the vegetation or spoil the place ? I started in August by putting in
a few Zosterops and two small Tanagers, one Blue-winged and one
Arthur's, that M. Decoux kindly gave me. From the beginning they
did well, but the Zosterops soon proved to be a real nuisance, puncturing
the young tender leaves, and had to be removed. After a few weeks,
when I was certain that conditions suited the birds, I bought in Paris
and Havre some Blue and Yellow-winged Sugar-birds, Green, Violet,
Superb, and Tri-coloured Tanagers ; at the same time Mr. Ezra sent
me a Hooded Pitta, Tri-coloured, Yellow, and Festive Tanagers, while
Mr. Spedan Lewis presented me with a pair of Red-backed Tanagers,
one Hainau ( Leptocoma rizophoroe), and one Beautiful (Nectarinia
pulchella) Sunbird, and Mme Lecallier a tame Blue-Throat. After
two months all these birds (two dozen in number) are in perfect con-
dition, as bright as at liberty, and their lovely plumage shows at its
best among the wonderful leaves and flowers of the luxuriant tropical
vegetation. They all agree very well together. None of them do any
harm to the plants, except the Blue Sugar-birds, which had to be
removed. The disposition of a few twigs and perches at proper places
helps to prevent too much soiling ; in fact, with very little keeping, it
is impossible to notice any trace of uncleanliness on the leaves. There
is no doubt that the secret of the good health of all these birds is in
the warm temperature, which never goes below 60* at night and rises
up to 85* or 90* in the day, and in the exercise that they are able to take.
As food, they have the usual Mellins' food, honey, milk mixture, of
which the Tanagers partake very freely, plenty of bananas and grapes,
and a little insectivorous mixture with some yolk of egg. Such food,
in a cage, would be fatal to small Tanagers, while in the present almost
natural conditions, they do beautifully on it. The only casualty so
far has been one Blue-winged Sugar Bird, which arrived in poor con-
dition and was found dead two days later.
It will be interesting to see the results over a longer period. If,
as I believe, it continues to be a great success, I hope that zoos and
bird-lovers will try this most attractive way of keening delicate tropical

species, which usually do poorly or require incessant care in ordinary
cages and aviaries. Many of our members may have greenhouses
or conservatories which could easily be turned into perfect greenhouse-
aviaries. The only point is to know how to grow stove-plants, which
is very easy indeed if planted as I have done, with sufficient heat and
moisture. I wish that I could soon have a chance of trying Humming-
birds ; they would very likely do exceedingly w^ell ; also Birds of
Paradise, but the latter unfortunately are too big for my house, except
perhaps King and Wilson's, which I hope to procure soon. If pairs
of birds could be isolated under such conditions many rare and delicate
species would probably nest and breed quite easily.
Of course, similar experiments with a lower temperature could be
tried with different birds and different plants, and would certainly
prove very attractive and successful.
I should like to add that the total expense of refitting and planting
the hot-house has been about #200.

NOTES ON BREEDING ABYSSINIAN
LOVEBIRDS (AGAPORNIS TARANTA )

The Abyssinian Lovebird is sadly neglected by the majority of
aviculturists. Five of the eight imported species of Agajpornis enjoy
an enormous popularity, but the remaining three-- cana, taranta,
and pullaria --are more or less outcasts, and are looked upon with
general disfavour. Of the three, taranta is probably the most un-
welcome, closely followed by the species which hails from Madagascar,
but either must seriously rival the Quaker Parrakeet as being the
most unpopular member of the Parrot tribe. Very probably the
Quaker has numerous enthusiastic admirers, but perhaps they have
never had four together in an aviary, as was my lot several years since ;
maybe I am unduly prejudiced against M. monachus. Very charming
examples undoubtedly exist, and possibly a single pair would be
endurable, nevertheless I maintain that no one could tolerate more
for any length of time. On the slightest provocation the quartet

would start screeching and chattering, and would keep it up almost
interminably. One pair, however, made some attempt to atone for
their vociferousness, and had the grace to construct a very large
untidy nest and furthermore duly produced several eggs, which
mysteriously disappeared, almost certainly devoured. Except for
the damage they do and the noise they create, Quakers would be rather
interesting birds to keep on account of their nest-building propensions.
Enough, however, of this digression. There are numerous reasons
why taranta --the largest member of the genus--is not a universal
favourite. It is a rather stolid bird, and possesses few of the amusing
and endearing mannerisms of the Nyasa or Blackcheek ; is not very
active ; usually somewhat timid, and immediately on the approach
of anyone scuttles away into a nest-box, and so is undesirable from a
display point of view ; spiteful towards weaker birds, especially while
breeding operations are in progress, and to do really well a pair requires
an aviary to itself. In addition it is not considered a free-breeder,
so taken all round on first appearance the Abyssinian seems an
altogether undesirable acquisition.
There is a trite proverb which says, " First Appearances are often
deceptive," and this is very true in the case of the little Ethiopian
Lovebird. Many are its faults, but it has much to recommend it.
Once acclimatized it is very hardy and stands the winter outdoors well,
provided the aviary is dry and draught-free ; tolerably long-lived ;
quiet, not possessing the ear-piercing shriek common to so many Kosy-
faced ; of pleasing and neat appearance, and presents no difficulty as
regards sexing.
Although not as prolific as some of its congeners, examples of which
will commence breeding operations within a few weeks of arrival,
its breeding presents little difficulty provided thoroughly well-
established birds are used for the attempt.
Abyssinians are often imported in a very poor state and take a
considerable time to recover from the effects of their capture and
journey, and consequently to attain that high state of health and
vigour so necessary for reproduction.
They are unlikely to take on domestic duties until their second
or even third year in captivity, and it is this lengthy settling-down

that prompts aviculturists to lose patience and dispose of them before
they have given their birds a really fair trial.
Hence, recorded breeding successes are few. The first to be
fortunate was Mr. A. G. Groves, who had one youngster reared in
1925. A couple were reared in the aviaries of Mr. W. Lewis a few
weeks later. In 1926, Mr. W. Shore-Baily had four from one nest--
a truly great achievement. Last year Mr. M. T. Allen bred two,
but they both died, presumably of paralysis contracted as the result
of sitting out in a July deluge. There are probably other instances,
but I cannot recall any to mind.
During the present year I have managed to breed from one pair,
and have obtained partial success with a second. Each pair had one
of my standard 22 feet aviaries to itself, and was disturbed as little
as possible. The first pair had had over two years outdoors without
showing any inclination to nest, and the other pair was put out this
last May, but was composed of very mature examples, having gained
premier honours in their class at the Crystal Palace Show, 1924 ; so
that at the present time they are probably between six and seven years
old. I did not hope to breed with the latter pair, not on account of
their age, but because they were exceedingly tame, and tameness is
not usually conducive to good breeding results. Once in an aviary,
however, they very quickly lost their confidence, and are now even
more retiring than the pair which has enjoyed three years' comparative
freedom. This species usually lays four eggs--sometimes three--
measuring approximately 19 by 25*5 mm. The male does not appear
to take any part in the incubation, which would seem to require
nineteen to twenty days, but being somewhat timid and secretive birds
it is inadvisable to interfere with them, and it is difficult to ascertain
the exact duration. While incubating the female leaves the nest
only for an occasional short spell, which she spends in taking exceedingly
vigorous exercise. Once the young are hatched, however, the periods
are larger and more frequent.
In the day-time the male is only allowed in the nest-box for the
purpose of feeding his sitting-mate--a duty performed with the greatest
diligence, but he is allowed into the box at night.
The young leave the nest when some five weeks old, and are

indistinguishable from the female parent, except that the beak instead
of being red, as in the adult, is orange suffused with black. In size
they are almost, if not quite, equal to the female.
The youngsters start to fend for themselves when about ten days
out of the nest, but are still fed by their parents for a seemingly
unnecessarily long time.
Both pairs fed their young almost exclusively on flowering and
seeding grasses, supplemented by white sunflower. Millet and canary
were left untouched, as also were various insectivorous foods, soaked
sponge-cake, mealworms, fruit, etc. The w&apos;hole family retires into the
nest-box at night, the male bubbling over with anxiety in his efforts
to coax in his offspring. The adult plumage is assumed at the first
moult, in the case of my birds when they were little more than four
months old.
Regarding the nest-making propensity of this species, experiences
are bound to differ to a considerable extent. It is almost impossible
to generalize where birds are concerned, as they vary so greatly in
temperament, also the conditions under which they are kept play such
an important part.
It has been stated that this Lovebird does not construct a nest,
as do the other species of Agapornis, but " the female plucks feathers
from her breast at the outset of breeding and uses these as a nest
foundation ". Such may be the case, but my experience was totally
dissimilar. The " Palace " wdnners made no attempt whatever at a
nest, but laid their eggs in the shallow depression at the bottom of
their box. There were certainly numerous feathers in their box, but
I would hesitate long before asserting that these had been deliberately
plucked, and were not merely the stray feathers to be found in any
Parrakeet nest-box.
The other pair wrought great havoc with the woodwork of their
aviary, and carried a large quantity of splinters and short slivers
into their nest-box, so that the bottom had a covering to a depth
of over an inch. Feathers again were present, but not so numerous
as in the first case.
A pair of Abyssinians which nested in America constructed a nest
of pieces of paper and canvas which they pulled off the front protection

of their aviary. From the foregoing it will be seen that this species
adopts one of a variety of methods when contemplating reproduction.
Little seems to be known concerning their nesting habits in the
wild state. It has been suggested that A. taranta takes possession of
the nests of a species of Weaver, in a similar manner to which
A. roseicollis is said to be accustomed ; also it has been averred that
rocky crevices form the site.
An expedition, under the leadership of Major J. A. Coats and
Mr. " Babe " White (the noted American big-game hunter), is shortly
leaving for Abyssinia, the object being the collection of zoological
specimens for the Field Museum, an American institution. It is to
be hoped that a fair share of attention will be bestowed on the birds
of the country, in which case further information on Agapornis taranta
should be forthcoming.
In conclusion, some members have probably wondered why
A. taranta is so called. The explanation is to be found in A Voyage
to Abyssinia and Travels into the interior of that Country in the Years
1809-10, by Henry Salt, F.R.S. He writes : " Psittacus taranta --
the Abyssinian Parroquet. As this bird is probably a new species,
the only one that was seen in Abyssinia, and most numerous about
the Pass of Taranta, I have ventured to attach to it the above names."

Sir, --Imported for the first time in 1927, Pyranga bidentata has
not yet been bred in Europe, and when my pair went to nest early in
May this year, I had great hope of being the first to breed them. They
selected the very top of a cypress for their nesting site, and built
a nest of grass and roots. This was so flimsily constructed that the
eggs could be seen through the bottom. The hen sat steadily enough
for ten days, when I examined the eggs and found them to be infertile.
In colour they were a light green, thickly speckled all over with minute
reddish brown spots. The clutch was three. The cock, which was
a brilliant scarlet when imported, changed at the moult to yellow.

infertility of tlie eggs I do not know, but tbis is the first bird in the
many hundreds I have kept that has failed to maintain its natural
colour. Later in the year they again nested, but no eggs were laid,
which makes me suspect that I have an elderly pair. This species
is quite easy to cater for, as they will eat bread and milk, biscuit meal,
banana, currants, and a good deal of mixed seed, and they take, of
course, all the insect food that they can get.

Sir, --Finch hybrids have such a name for sterility that few
persons ever try to breed from them, but the cock hybrid produced
from a Hooded Siskin and a Canary seems to be an exception. I have
such a bird bred in 1925 in my aviary. This bird shows no Canary
colouring except that the red of the Siskin is replaced by a very dark
orange. Its shape is that of a Canary.
I have another bird bred in the same nest marked like the hen
Hooded Siskin which has shown no inclination to nest, but I once saw
it feeding a hen bird, another hybrid, evidently a Siskin X Canary.
In 1926 there happened to be a rather feeble hen Canary in the
aviary with this cock Hooded Siskin X Canary. These two birds
mated and produced about six young out of two nests. Nearly all
these young suddenly died a few days after I had caged them up in
the autumn, either owing to quarrelling among themselves or to a
feeble constitution.
Last year I turned a hen Goldfinch into the aviary. The only
thing that happened was the nearly total destruction of all the shrubs.
The two birds took no notice of each other. They ought to have been
caged together for a few weeks at first.
This year I mated it up to a Canary again. The first nest built
in a Hartz cage in the shelter produced two young. These are more
Canary than Siskin in colour.
The second nest, built in a pine tree in the flight, produced four
young out of seven eggs : one of these is very much like the first two,
a second has a yellowish breast and several whitish feathers in its
tail, the third is very like the hybrid father at the same age. The

orange colouring only appeared when the bird was about four months
old. The fourth young bird is much the same, but has a greenish
tinge and a few white feathers in its tail. Out of the six eggs laid in
the Hartz cage again only one was hatched and reared. This bird is
mostly Siskin, but the white tail appears again and a greenish patch
on one side of the head.
Two, hatched out in the fourth nest in the pine tree, were killed
by the rain at a few days' old. A fifth nest in the Hartz cage in early
October she deserted after incubating for a week, but all the eggs
were clear.
I tried to avoid getting a Canary with a white tail, as I found in
1926 that all the young inherited that partial alienism, but the first
hen I got was no good and I had to fall back upon a very badly marked
hen whose only recommendation was her vigour. The result is not so
bad, as my aim is to keep the most Siskin-like of the young and pair
them up with other Finches next year.

Sir,- --It has been my good fortune to have had some little success
with Lovebirds, and one of my friends, Mr. S. Harvey, has persuaded
me that readers may be interested to know of my experiences. Early
in 1927 I secured two Blackcheeks and two Nyasas. The Black-
cheeks were a pair ; but the Nyasas proved to be hens. The Nyasas
both laid, sat closely, and one died in the log. The hen Blackcheek
was rather young, so the male, rather than pay the bachelor tax,
made advances to the remaining Nyasa hen. She willingly accepted
the Blackcheek's proposals, and they started housekeeping. After
what seemed to me an interminable period, which nearly exhausted
my patience, one young one appeared ; but he was very disreputable,
only being clothed on the head and wings. He soon became respectable,
however, and was very pretty, having a black face, a red forehead,
and a salmon crescent on the breast. The next nest produced four
young ones. I would like to mention here that the Blackcheek male,
while his Nyasaland wife sat faithfully in the log, flirted violently
outside with the young Blackcheek hen. Sometime later he paid the

penalty of his misdeeds, through the agency of a cat. I was then
unable to breed any more half-breeds ; but this year one of the half-
breeds mated with the Blackcheek hen, and the union produced one
young one, which in colour favoured the Blackcheek ; but the head,
instead of being black, was inclined to be dark purple. It looked as
if there was red underneath, covered by a black mantle which could
not quite obscure the red. The parent birds are now nesting again.
One of the other half-breeds mated with the Nyasa hen, which had
become a widow. This union produced two young ones ; but one
disappeared, and the other is now a very pretty bird. The top of
the head has all the red of the Nyasa, and the back of the neck is pale
green. The face is not black ; but is of a dusky purple colour. I
exhibited these two young birds at the monthly meeting of our
Avicultural Society, and they were very much admired. You will
see now I have quite a variety, Blackcheeks, Nyasalands, Half-breeds,
and Threequarter-breeds each way, and they are all very happy
together.

A BEMEDY fob sick pabbots
Sir, --Parrots seem to be fairly susceptible to a complaint brought
about by any sudden change of diet, and as I have just succeeded
in curing a bird thus affected, I think it may be worth while publishing
the details. The bird, by the way, was a hen Nyasa Lovebird, and I
had previously lost one from the same cause. The symptoms were
a sickly appearance and severe diarrhoea.
I first gave about five drops of paraffin oil and then put the bird
in a small cage with some soaked seed and a little bisurated magnesia
in the water (about 3 grains to \ oz. water).
The change in this case was from canary seed to panicum, so the
soaked seed first given was canary and then by degrees soaked panicum,
and then the dry seed. The change from one seed to another was
carried over about a week. Under this treatment the bird was quite
normal again by evening.

Sir, --A reference in a recent number of the Magazine to the mis-
directed mating instinct of a Parrot prompts me to quote the rather
amusing case of a cock Budgerigar. This bird spent all its time trying
to win the affections of a Java Sparrow. He would warble to it,
bobbing his head up and down, and every now and then taking a rapid
flight round it. The more he was repelled by pecks the more animated
he seemed to become ; but his greatest delight was when the Java
had got thoroughly bored and gone to sleep by the side of its mate,
to nibble the feathers of its neck. One Java was apparently as good
to him as another, but he only paid his attentions to one at a time,
and both birds were cocks ! After the Javas were removed he turned
his attentions to a pair of Diamond Finches and again to the total
exclusion of his mate. She tried to recall him with offers of food,
but without success.
I have heard of a cock Rosella placing his affections on a Red-
headed Cardinal, where there certainly is some resemblance ; but
where the resemblance exists between a Budgerigar and a Java or

Sir, --In a letter dated 27th October, Mr. John Frostick writes :--
"You will be interested to know that my pair of Swainson's had two
young birds hatched on the 17th inst. They are doing well in their
cage 30 in. by 30 in. by 15 in." The well-known Blue Mountain
Lorikeet has, of course, been bred on numerous occasions in the past,
but never, I imagine, in a cage of the small dimensions of the present
case. It would seem from the various published accounts that
Trichoglossus novce-hollandice is a somewhat prolific species. Mention
may be made of a few outstanding instances. A pair at the old
Blackpool Aquarium and Menagerie reared young " year after year for
some four years previous to 1890 " (Avicultural Magazine, 1902,
p. 167). Miss Rosa Little met with considerable success in 1907-8,
rearing numerous youngsters in a " cage " 5 feet long, 3 feet wide, and

A more recent case is that of Sir Leo Chiozza Money, who writes
concerning his Swainson's : " This is the third brood of this pair since
the Spring of 1919 " (Bird Notes, January, 1920, p. 21). But the
aviculturist to be most successful with this Lorikeet is our member,
Dr. Amsler, whose record at one time, I believe, stood at sixteen young
reared from a single pair in three years !
In Bird Notes, 1921, p. 232, Dr. Amsler writes :--
" My Swainson's Lorikeets which have been here since 1916, have
a small separate aviary and rear from three to five couples of young
each year. They never stop nesting, in fact I have never had clear
eggs in winter, whereas both this summer and last there has been one
clutch which was infertile.
" So far this season six young have been reared (two is the invariable
clutch with me), and the birds are again sitting."
So that members in search of profitable birds could do worse than
obtain a pair of Swainson's.
In connection with the fore-mentioned Blackpool Lorikeets, Mr. W.
Osbaldeston makes a rather interesting observation, as follows :--
" One year a very curious, handsome, ' sportively ' plumaged bird
was reared. The head was red with lacings of white, and the shoulders
were tinted with green. The greater portions of all other parts of
wings, body, and tail were of a bright chrome yellow, intermixed with
green feathers here and there ; and the tail feathers were tipped with
red; making a really handsome, showy, and rare bird. It was a
young bird in May, 1891, and was alive some three years afterwards
to my knowledge " (Avicultural Magazine, 1912, p. 168).

I noticed in October Magazine mention is made of too many meal-

with my Long-tailed Grassfinches I lost a nest of four just previous to
the present one, and after the first nest, through my running short
of mealworms. I could only spare about six a day for two days,
but the young (a week or ten days old at that) were killed one at a
time and brought out to the entrance of the nest too big to pull through.
The first nest they had heaps of mealworms and all went well. I went
away for my holiday and found they had not been removed--hence
killed. This last nest has a sturdy lot of birds also. Even the Zebra
Finches feed their young on a lot of mealworms. So did Goldbreasts.
Breeding in cages may cause the difference. The Avadavats are now
chewing mealworms for all they are worth !

A HYBRID FISCHER'S X MASKED LOVEBIRD

Besides assisting in the production of the young hybrid, the Fischer's
mated with a female of its own kind, in the same aviary, and two of
their offspring, about a fortnight younger than the hybrid, are on
the wing.
In the same aviary there is a second female Masked now sitting on
eggs, but whether the Fischer's has committed trigamy remains to be
seen. It is somewhat unusual for a male Agapornis to mate with two,
and possibly three, females, as Lovebirds are prevalently regarded as
strong supporters of monogamy.

Sir, --In a recent letter our member, Mr. W. R. Bearby, writes as
follows : "It will interest you, and add to your data on Lovebirds
that the hybrids of A. liliance X A. nigrigenis have proved fertile,
both sexes having related back to one or other of the original species.
The young, however, are practically indistinguishable and so now
lose interest."
It will be recalled that Mr. Sumner Marriner's hybrid A. nigrigenis X
A. roseicollis, breeding inter se, produced two of their own peculiar
progeny.
