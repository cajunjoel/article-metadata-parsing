KEEPING WADERS IN AN AVIARY

<bodyText confidence="0.993956806451613" page_id="58072851"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
By Leon Lippens (Le Zoute-Knokke, Belgium)
A few years ago a paper about the charm of keeping Waders in
iviaries by a Belgian scientist, Dr. J. M. Derscheid, who died in a
jerman concentration camp was published in the Avicultural
vTagazine.
In 1952 I started a modest experiment myself at Le Zoute-Knokke,
1 seaside lesort along the Belgian coast, near the Dutch frontier and
acing the estuary of the River Scheldt. My family owns there a
tretch of dunes, woods, and a little salt-marsh called " Zwin
he Zwin is all that actually remains of a big estuary up which
;&gt;oats sailed to Bruges in the Middle Ages.
We have made a Reserve of this site. The birds being protected,
nany interesting species breed on the salt marsh and in the vicinity :
^vocet (30 pairs), Redshank, Kentish Plover (60 pairs), Sheld-
)uck, Little Plover, Hoopoe (5 pairs), Golden Oriole, Icterine
Varbler, etc. The variety of breeding birds is great : ninety-five
ifferent kinds are recorded as breeders.
To help the public know all these birds better we built a few aviaries
1 which we keep, in the summer months, most of the birds of this
\0x25A1untry. No exotic birds are kept. Last year, 1 955 ? we showed about
00 birds of 100 different species. Most of these birds are caught in
iring and are released at the end of the summer. The birds are caught
1 different ways and several thousand are ringed each year to study
leir migration. Only relatively few are kept for the aviaries ; if a
ird does not seem to thrive in a cage it is released immediately. This
&apos;stem explains how all our birds are in immaculate plumage and in
Meet condition.
Some birds are more difficult to keep in captivity than others, for
istance, Snipe, Green Sandpiper ( Tringa ochropus), and Little Plover
jharadnus dubius cuvomcus^j. One or two out of ten, however, seem to
ive a different character altogether and get very tame, and even seem

L. LIPPENS-KEEPING WADERS IN AN AVIARY
to enjoy being in an aviary. We keep these and release the others
after one or two days. There is practically no mortality. Waders
are charming birds and get very tame indeed after a few days, coming
to eat mealworms a few inches away from the keeper. .
During four years we have gained a lot of experience, and this
summer we succeeded in keeping in perfect condition the following :
Golden Plover, Grey Plover, Lapwing, Turnstone, Ringed Plover,
Kentish Plover, Little Plover, Dunlin, Curlew Sandpiper,. Knot,
Little Stint, Temminck's Stint, Oystercatcher, Curlew, Whimbrel,
Avocet, Bar-tailed Godwit, Redshank, Greenshank, Spotted Red-
shank, Wood Sandpiper, Green Sandpiper, Common Sandpiper,
Snipe, and Ruff. . . ,
The ideal conditions in which to keep Waders is to provide them
with a big aviary. (The one in the picture is 63 feet long and 18 feet
wide.) In it one can keep all the Waders together, from the little
Stint to the big Curlew, without any inconvenience. The birds can Hy
and there is room enough for every one to choose a small " territory
there is little fighting. , .
In this big aviary I kept more than ioo birds together this summer
with no loss. In it there is a miniature artificial marsh which provides
the very soft soil Waders need. It also gives them the opportunity
of taking a lot of exercise finding their natural food.
This natural food exists in the shape of flies and insects coming in
from the outside and settling on the mud. On sunny days it is a
pleasure to watch the Sandpipers, among others, hunt flies in the same
way as lizards do ; they suddenly freeze and advance very slowly
with the beak pointed forward ; then, faster than the human eye can
follow, they snatch a fly and swallow it. In some places hidden by
shrubs we place banana skins or some half-rotten pieces of meat to
attract more flies ; and it helps a lot. We do the same to keep
Flycatchers and W 7 agtails. ^ .
The most important thing for keeping \Vaders in good condition
is to provide them with a run of good soil. They have very tender
feet indeed ; white sand or ordinary soil is useless and even deadly.
After a week on such a surface most of the birds would begin to lunp
badly.
Inside our Wader aviary there is an island surrounded by watei
3 to 4 feet wide and from \ inch to 15 inches deep, with here anc
there a flat stone placed just under the surface of the water. Thi:
circular watercourse is built of concrete. As concrete is bad for the
feet of the Waders, we never brush or clean it. After a week a sort o
muddy moss grows on it ; it grows even faster when we lay a fev
sods of grass under the water. In these sods, by the way, live little
red worms, which seem to be much appreciated by the biids.
The island itself is of grass and is 1 inch lower than the edge o

the water. Once or twice a day we let the water rise and flood the
whole island. This creates a perfect natural marsh and it is wonderful
to watch birds getting excited and active the moment the flooding-
starts. Under the grass we placed a layer of clay (io inches). The
water trickles very slowly through the clay ; in fact, it takes about an
hour and a half before it has disappeared. The grass keeps very green
and soft ; here and there little mud pools remain. We replace a few
yaids of turf from time to time during summer.
Birds never get dirty looking because they can always wash in the
circular watercourse and they are clever enough to choose the right
depth and as near as possible to the place where the fresh water
runs out of a pipe. This pipe is hidden in plants and rocks.
_ Th e food given to the W aders is a mixture of raw meat, carrots,
biscuits, a few mealworms, and some maggots. I do not know
where the difference lies, but the birds seem to prefer maggots from
rotten fish to maggots from rotten meat. A good way to accustom
new birds to their new diet is to scrape the bottom of a near-by marsh
with a specially made small net of very fine metal mesh. Sand and
water flow through it and all kinds of insects and larvae are caught.
Thrown into the water of the aviary, they form a natural food and
provide excellent exercise for the birds who catch them.
The s\ stem of flooding the aviary possesses another advantage ;
the dioppings of the birds are washed away before they actually dry
and the aviary always keeps clean.
\\ e think that aviaries with a flat roof are dangerous because birds
ikying U P hurt their heads. \\ e built the centre of the aviary in a semi-
-ircular shape and I notice that birds seem to like flying up and down
this sort of passage. The total height of the cage is about io feet,
ind is high enough for birds naturally keeping on the ground. The
iviai y is planted with marsh plants taken in the neighbouring marshes,
rhey grow well as the aviary is regularly flooded.
 |Between the circular waterway and the wire there is a stretch
I ground about io to 20 inches wade. To prevent birds--especially
.reshly caught ones--running up and down along this wire (always
in unpleasant sight) we put a few stones, small logs, and some dense
slants like water irises all along it. The tame birds perch on these stones
md logs and the wilder ones keep nicely on the central island where
hey can be seen. They have no chance of hiding and get tame very
quickly.
A roof or a protection against rain is useless. \\ aders enjoy rain,
iome shade is provided by a few climbing plants like polygonum.
Waders kept in such an aviary look perfectly happy and natural
 |nd I could watch them for hours flying, bathing, feeding, squabbling,
ailing migratory birds passing high in the sky.
In October, 1954? we released nearly all our Waders. Some of them

J. R. LOWE-A FERTILE HYBRID
kept near the aviary for a few days and then migrated south 01 flew
to the Scheldt estuary. In February, 1955, a cold spell arrived and, to
our surprise, one morning an Oystercatcher and a Redshank were
pacing up and down in front of the aviary where we still had half a
dozen Waders. We caught them and put them in with the others
until the weather changed. They felt at home at once and when we
let them go again they did not attempt to fly away, but kept in the
vicinity until April.
In our Nature Reserve we keep--on several ponds--all kinds of
local wild duck and geese. As I like to see them fly, every spring
I catch a certain number of Teal, Garganey, Wigeon, etc. Instead of
pinioning them I just cut the wing feathers. These grow again in
June-Juiy but in the meantime these birds are so accustomed to the
public that many eat out of people's hands. They remain here as
full-winged birds until the winter and some of them even until
the following spring. Most of them, of course, disappear with the
mating season but some come back in September.
We do the same thing with several species of gulls and also with some
Bean Geese. It is fascinating to watch a huge Bean gander flying
low over the heads of visitors, with all the other geese, on the ground,
calling loudly ; after a little circling around the gander stretches out
his big webbed feet and makes a nearly vertical landing on the water.
On the 20th September of last year we gave their freedom back
to more than 300 birds, most of them Waders and insect-eating buds.
We ringed them and wished them a happy journey south.
We love our birds, all of them, but probably most of all, our Waders,
those most fascinating, mysterious, handsome, and charming of
birds.

By the Rev. J. R. Lowe (Cirencester, Glos., England)
It was in May, 1954, that I placed a pair of wild Turtle-Dove eggs
under a pair of Barbary Doves. They duly hatched and grew apace,
and were a cock and hen. They wintered in an attic with no artificial
warmth.
In early March the cock Turtle was placed in an aviary with a
Barbary hen, and the hen Turtle was joined up in anothei aviary
with a Barbary cock, and called Pairs A and B. By mid-March the cock
Turtle was displaying and it was a little strange to hear a song that
one would not normally hear till May. By mid-April the Barbary
hen of Pair A was sitting on fertile eggs ; these duly hatched.
Now in October they have assumed adult plumage. The cock
has a pale grey front tinged with a vinaceous wash, the head and

neck a slightly deeper grey, the wings and back pale brown, with
only faint markings compared to a pure Turtle's wings, tail dark
grey, each feather tipped with white, flights dark grey. Collar not
chequered as in the Turtle, but solid black bordered top and bottom
with narrow white band, the whole effect more like two patches
as in the Turtle collar. Iris of eye hazel, not ruby as on the Barbary.
On the whole this cock favours the Turtle rather than the Barbary.
The hen of Pair A is a uniform dun colour with slightly darker
flights and tail, collar small and chequered as in the pure Turtle.
For reference these two young birds may be called C and D.
Pair B did not nest till May, and one wondered if the delay was
because of the usual times of laying by migratory Turtle hens.
Two young birds duly developed adult plumage and they are identical
and look very like pure Barbarys, rather richer in colour, i.e. deep
biscuit fawn ; in one the collar is pronounced and chequered, in
he other collar hardly visible, but what there is is chequered ; iris
&gt;f e y e hazel not ruby. In the results from Pairs A and B the cock from
:ach pair seems to have influenced the colour of the young.
In August the bird C was cooing and displaying ; both coo and
lisplay is a curious mixture of Turtle and Barbary amusing to
jvatch and hear.
C was placed in an aviary with a 1953 Barbary hen on
9th and 20th September. Two young were hatched from this pair
nd to date, 5th October, are nicely feathered and both in brownish
&gt;lumage are identical with D, the young hen from Pair A.
In the spring of 1956 it is hoped to pair the pure hen Turtle to her
jiybrid son E, hybrid cock C to hybrid hen F, and pure Turtle cock
P his daughter D, and the September 3rd generation, back to pure
arbarys and Turtles inter se.
If all these matings are fertile one may assume any amount of pure
urtle blood can be introduced into a Barbary strain as required,
do not expect for one moment that these results are in any way
ew to aviculture, but it has been fun proving things just for oneself,
lough I doubt if any of the above deserves to be incorporated in so
ugust a journal as the Avicultural Magazine.
Since writing the above the iris of dove G is as ruby as pure
arbary. This is not true of the other hybrids.

(.Kakatoe sulphurea parvula)
By S. Brian Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey)
I bought my Timor Cockatoos in the autumn of 1952, while the
importation of parrots was still allowed, the expett who sold them
telling me that they had been imported in the previous May and that
they had " not quite finished moulting
It was nearly two years later when their vicious feather biting
abated and it is my personal view that it was for the rehabilitation of
the pair, rather than for their successful breeding, that their owner
deserves some credit. Every conceivable device was adopted at some
time or another--more protein, less protein ; green food ; sprouted
seed ; fresh branches ; an outdoor aviary ; separation and reunion ;
an aviary where they could hide, and one where they couldn t.
I think they stopped feather-biting after the 1954 moult, but the cock
was still not fully flighted until some time in the spring of this year
( 1 955) * The secret of how to stop the vice remains with the cockatoos
--7 have no idea, but I rather doubt if it has much to do with diet.
Timor Cockatoos are similar to the better-known Lesser Sulphur
Cockatoo, from which they can be distinguished by the considerably
less well developed areas of sulphur-yellow on the back of the head
and cheek, and by the virtual absence of yellow on the chest and
belly. In addition, they are markedly smaller ; hens are often really
tiny and must be the smallest cockatoo that exists.
Adults are readily sexed by the eye colour, that ol the cock being
almost black while the hen is red-brown. Immatures have clear-grey
eyes. I do not yet know when the colour changes. Males appear to
be considerably bigger and the more massive head serves to sex
them as with all the related species that I have seen.
As the popular name suggests, the main home of parvula is in Timor
Island. Skins in the Natural History Museum, South Kensington,
are labelled East Timor, South Flores, Pantar, and Lombok. I have
not been able to glean any information on the habits of the species in
its native land. Observation in aviaries suggests that they are arboreal
in general habit ; mine never seem to go on the ground except to
reach food or water dishes. As with the Citron-crested Cockatoo,
hawthorn berries are immediately accepted as attractive food, which
suggests that something similar may be a favoured food in the wild.
My birds, like the rest of the cockatoos, receive a staple diet of oats,
wheat, barley, and cracked maize with sunflower. They eat a little
apple, rarely seem to be interested in green food, but eat bread and
milk and hard-boiled egg and bread-crumbs when they have been
trained to do so. i
In January, 1955, the pair were together in an aviary, about 15 feet

long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, with some overhead cover forming
an open-fronted shelter. Like all their near allies they seem to be as
hard as nails. Nest-boxes (a grandfather's clock and a grape barrel)
were placed in the flight in early March, but up till 22nd May there
was no evidence of nesting. On that date I surprised one feeding the
other (I don't know which) and heard the end of some of the mutual
beak clicking which is so characteristic of the display of the Citron-
crested Cockatoo. A few days later they started opening up the
grandfather's clock. In mid-June the male disappeared during the
daytime, and on 26th June both birds disappeared for a time. On
^th July both birds roosted in a box at night. By 20th July the pair
was definitely sitting. I would estimate that an egg was laid about
I 4 th July. Young were definitely heard on 7th August, and may have
been heard two days earlier, so that incubation takes about three
weeks. This suggests that the incubation period is decidedly shorter
than with K. sulphurea cristino-cristata, the breeding of which was
reported earlier (Kendall, 1955), but it must be stressed that I never
examine nests, progress being assessed solely by the behaviour of the
birds.
It is hardly necessary to say how thrilled I was to hear the first
Daby noises. Throughout the entire incubation period I had kept
religiously to the side of the aviary remote from the grandfather's clock
lest. Long and lovingly I looked at that grandfather's clock. The
Darrel, which had been the second string, seemed rather redundant
n the flight, but it had served a useful purpose as an exercise for the
occupants' beaks, and on 29th August I noted in my aviary diary the
nteresting fact that the parents occasionally bolted into the barrel
md not into the grandfather's clock. I couldn't help thinking how
&apos;ortunate it was that they had chosen the nice deep healthy grand-
ather's clock and not the flimsy barrel in which undoubtedly the eggs
vould have desiccated and the young died of dryness if not cold.
On the last day in August, while feeding the birds one sunny
norning, my eyes happened to move from the clock to the barrel
md there, practically in the open air, fully exposed to the public
, r aze on a level with the hugely excavated opening of the barrel, were
he young Timors ! ! ! So it comes about that, as long as the sun was
hining, records on the Timor Cockatoo increased as never before.
A hen first seen the parent bird was sitting at right angles to the
ntrance hole with a young bird by the side and with the other,
)resumably, on the other side or actually covered. On 3rd September,
t good view was had of one young bird which appeared to have no
sathers at all. Six days later two young were seen, with quite well
ieveloped crests but with the body in quill. On 18th September the
oung appeared to be reasonably well feathered. On 28th September
looked into the barrel and saw two well feathered young, the eyes

S. B. KENDALL-BREEDING THE TIMOR COCKATOO
appeared dark, die head sizes gave the appearance of a tiue pair,
while the beaks were light horn-coloured ; quite different from their
parents or from Citron-crests of similar age. On 14th October one
young bird looked out, probably for the first time. Beak and feet were
horn or flesh-coloured. This bird emerged on 16th October, and
roosted in the open flight with a clear star-lit night and the sharpest
frost we have had so far this winter (1 st December). Emergence from
the nest seemed to coincide with the reversal of the hind toes. On
17th October the young bird sat out in miserable cold and sleet.
I suffered infinitely more than he. I managed to get a tarpaulin over
his part of the flight, whereupon he moved under the open wires,
where it was presumably less stuffy !
So I managed to rear (for, I believe, the first time in Britain) a baby
Timor Cockatoo. He has never looked back, and although at the
time of writing, still with the parents, is probably self-supporting.
Up till the time the young Timor fledged, there had not appeared
to be a tremendous difference in development between the two young,
although one was clearly several days behind the other. I fully
expected the second to fledge within a week of the first and as the
days went by I reassured myself that u Beta " was still alive by walking
into the aviary and closely investigating the barrel. Sure enough
" Beta 55 was there, a little thin on top, sitting close to the entrance hole
and always closely guarded by father, who, incidentally, does nearly
all the day-time nursing.
So the days went by, until 1st November, when, my worst fears
realized, I had to take the barrel to pieces in order to release the leg
of the young bird, trapped for at least ten days between two staves of
the barrel.
I felt very upset about the whole business, and went through the
usual bird-keeper's misery of blaming myself for not having supplied
a sounder barrel, not having looked earlier, etc. (but not, be it noted,
without the thought that if they had had a sounder barrel they might
not have nested anyway). At the time I was inclined to destroy the
baby, for the leg seemed hopelessly crippled. What followed is a story
in itself and must be left for another time. One thing that is certain
is that my friend " Joe ", who at this moment is sitting on my foot pre-
tending to learn to crack a sunflower-seed, will never believe that his
adopted father ever could have contemplated his destruction on that
horrible morning only a month ago.

As described above, S. B. Kendall has bred the Timor Cockatoo
(.Kakatoe sulphured parvula). It is believed that this may be a first
success.

TWO FIRST BREEDINGS AT THE KESTON
FOREIGN BIRD FARM (SEASON 1955)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998374636363637" page_id="58072859"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
There have been two first breedings at Keston this season, namely
the Chestnut-and-Black Warbling Finch (Poospiza nigro-rufa) and the
Yellow-headed Marsh Bird (Agelaeus icterocephalus ). One young bird
was reared in each case, but, unfortunately, only the Warbling Finch
is eligible for a Medal, as the young Marsh Bird, although it lived for
some time after fledging, died before it was fully independent of its
parents.
Incidentally, its death may serve as a warning to those who may be
thinking of using inch mesh instead of half inch netting for an aviary.
The former is, of course, quite all right for larger birds, but there are
borderline ones, and this Marsh Bird is a case in point. Inch mesh
netting successfully contained the adults, but the newly fledged young
one could pass through it with ease and, as it was constantly getting
out, it had to be caught up and put in a cage in the aviary. The hen
was seen to feed it through the bars but it did not make the progress
it would have done loose in the aviary, and although an excellent
specimen when first fledged it eventually died.
The male Marsh Bird is simply black with a bright lemon yellow
head and an area of black round the eye, while the female is very
dark brownish-black with her head faintly suffused with greenish-
yellow. The young bird resembled its mother.
They constructed a deep cup-shaped nest in a hawthorn over-
hanging the pond in our largest aviary, and as is the case with so
many birds, the cock's character changed entirely as soon as they
started breeding. Despite the fact that the aviary was so large and
thickly planted he hunted out and actually murdered another cock
Marsh Bird, with which, when both were bachelors, he had lived
for a year in perfect amity.
He jealously guarded the vicinity of the nest as he sat on a projecting
branch close by, frequently uttering his loud shrill defiant song as a
sort of challenge to all comers, and chivvying the hen back to the nest
f he thought she was being too long collecting food.

10 E. J. BOOSEY-TWO FIRST BREEDINGS AT KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM
Although they ate insectivorous mixture, bread and milk, and a
certain amount of millet spray and canary, the young one, which was
fed only by the hen, was largely reared on insects that she caught
in the aviary, as well as a large daily allowance of gentles and a small
one of mealworms.
The Chestnut-and-Black Warbling Finches shared their aviary with
a pair of Gape or Namaqua Doves, its dimensions being io feet long
by 4 feet wide by 7 feet high, and it was in a very sunny, sheltered
position.
It contained no bushes, but our General Manager, Mr. Cummings,
who was looking after them, had the bright idea of fixing a tangle of
" Old Man's Beard " high up in a corner of the flight, thus at last
finding a use for this weed which is such a curse in certain soils,
and at the same time providing the Warbling Finches with a nesting
site that they took to at once. In it they constructed a very neat little
cup-shaped nest, and soon the hen was incubating three bluish-white
eggs spotted with black and dark grey at the larger end.
All the eggs however proved to be clear, and it was at about this
time that the birds were given a few mealworms each day in addition
to their usual supply of gentles. The hen soon laid again, and after
sitting for some time on two clear eggs, deposited a third which was
hatched and reared into a very fine young one. It is not like either
of its parents, being simply grey with darker central and whitish outer
tail feathers and a whitish eyebrow streak.
The male of these Warbling Finches is a very smart and immaculate
little bird rather resembling a Blackcap in shape, and certainly not
in the least finch-like. It is very dark slate-grey above, the eye being
in a black area with a white stripe above and below it, and the fore-
head is also black. The two central tail feathers are almost black, and
the two outer ones white. The belly is white and the rest of the under-
surface rich chestnut. The female is simply a much paler and duller
edition of her mate.
The Warbling Finches come from South America, and the length
of the Chestnut-and-Black is about 5-8 inches.
The cock bird is an industrious and tuneful, if slightly monotonous,
songster, and despite his name his song has none of the lovely liquid
notes of the true Warblers such as our own Garden-Warbler and
Blackcap, and is more bunting-like in quality. Nevertheless, it is a
very cheerful attractive little song.
Very few of the genus Poospiga seem ever to have been imported
at all, and then only occasionally in ones and twos. Prestwich, always
a mine of information on such subjects, kindly supplied me with the
following information about nigro-rufa : " Ghestnut-and-Black
Warbling Finch : De Quincey brought two about 1924. The Zoo
had one in 1932, listed as new to the collection." " There are," he

added, " sixteen species of Warbling Finch of which only six appear
to have been imported."
Although I think our pair might possibly be wintered successfully
in one of our sheltered terrace aviaries without heat, they and their
young one have just been given a lamp in the same aviary in which
the parents successfully passed last winter, in order to avoid running
unnecessary risks.
Incidentally, this necessitated catching them up and the hen was
found to have gone to nest for a third time, incubating three eggs,
but it was too late for there to be any chance of her successfully
reading young.
Our pair eat a certain amount of canary and millet spray, but to
flourish they need a more varied diet, including insectivorous mixture,
bread and milk, gentles, a few mealworms, and occasionally a piece
of apple which they sometimes eat and sometimes ignore.

A NEW DANISH BREEDING RESULT--BREEDING
OF THE COMBASOU

In 1951 Mr. Aage Nielsen, who also lives in Koge, Denmark,
succeeded in breeding the Combasou. The Combasous were
" parasites on a pair of Firefinches, which fed and hatched the
young Combasous.
In 1955 I succeeded in breeding the Combasou, but in this case
the Combasous themselves constructed the nest, hatched, and fed
the young.
In my garden I constructed an outdoor aviary, the rear of
which is set up against a wooden fence. One-third of the aviary is
covered at the rear, otherwise the aviary is open. I have not planted
anything, I have only placed a lot of branches for perching. The
aviary is about 14 feet long, 7 feet high, and 7 feet deep. Just under
the roof in the farthest corner I placed a large roll of coarse
meshed wire netting for breeding, the roll being about ij feet in
diameter and filled with pine twigs.

I am somewhat a novice in the noble art of bird-keeping, and don t

finches, 1,1 Canaries with eight young, 1,1 Blue-breasted Quails
with nine young, 1,1 Combasous, and a lot of Zebra Finches.
I have been strongly advised to clean up this collection, especially
the Combasous, which, I was told by experienced bird-keepers,
would most likely act as nest-intruders.
About the 1st July I saw the male Combasou gather dry grasses,
hemp, and other kinds of nesting materials, but I didn't pay much
attention to this, as I had read and heard that the Combasous were
parasites, and placed their broods in the nests of other birds, who
then hatched and fed the young. It was only when I saw just one of
the Combasous at a time in the aviary that I became suspicious
that something was about to happen.
I didn't dare investigate the nest, which was placed in the wire
netting, and was very loosely constructed of grass and hay, with the
entrance sloping down. In the middle of July I again saw both of the
Combasous in the aviary at the same time, but only for a short visit.
Then the female returned to the nest again. I can't say if they took
turns in hatching, but I noticed that they were both in the nest at
night.
About the feeding, I have learned that both the male and the
female are ardent feeders as long as the young are in the nest. It
always happens in this way--first the female enters the nest, and
directly after her the male. The male is always the first to leave the
nest, perhaps the direct feeding is undertaken by the female alone.
On the 3rd August, two fledgelings left the nest, and now these
two fledgelings are fed by the male only. The female has no interest
at all in the young, even if they are begging her for food. Now and
then I have seen the young begging Zebras and Cordon-bleus for food.
Sometimes they succeed, but it also happens that they are pecked at
instead of getting something to eat.
The male Combasou guards his young most carefully, and will not
tolerate their being harmed by any other bird. The female is, as
stated above, quite indifferent. In spite of the fact that the fledgelings
left the nest seven days ago, they spend the nights with their parents in
the nest.
I have had the Combasous about one year, and the former owner
had them for about the same period.

Prestwich, writes :--

approach is the event described by Mrs. M. Boyd in Bird Notes, 1914,

The hens of the respective pairs (Combasous and Cordon-bleus)

By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
If you want to keep a close eye on your collections it is sometimes
1 little inconvenient to have birds in two different places 6,000 miles
ipart. But special circumstances, which often crop up nowadays,
lave caused unforeseen conditions. I am probably the only
iviculturist with aviaries in California and in Normandy at the same
ime.
My Los Angeles collection consists of some 200 birds, mostly small,
vhile we keep at Cleres ten times as many, particularly large species,
vhich are in charge of Mr. F. E. Fooks. My aviaries in California,
en in number, are my own responsibility, with some help from my
hauffeur. Unless I am away I myself feed all the birds early every
norning, and it is just as enjoyable to me as it was when I had a few
ages in my bathroom during my childhood in Paris.
In Los Angeles five Flamingos and two Trumpeters live at liberty
a the half-acre garden and cause no trouble. The Trumpeters are
ielightfully tame and amusing. My collection of doves is excellent,
have added to it since last year a pair of the very rare Grey-headed
Iround Pigeons from Cuba ( Geotrygon caniceps ), an almost extinct
pecies, Jamaican Doves (. Leptoptila jamaicensis ), and pairs of Thick-
lilled and Pink-necked Green Pigeons ( Treron nipalensis and T. vernans).

ote that this species lays only one egg per clutch, while the very
losely related Luzon Bleeding-heart lays two.

1 4 J. DELACOUR-MY BIRDS AT LOS ANGELES AND AT CLERES, 1 955
Besides two Mountain Witches, four Brush Bronze-wings, and a
number of small Doves have been reared (Peruvian, Pygmies, Ashy,
Silver Diamond). Philippine Pheasant-tailed and Jobi Doves ;
Ruddy, Blue-headed, Moustache and Martinique Ground Pigeons,
and Nicobars did not nest successfully. Among the Australian Finches,
which are doing exceedingly well outdoors in California, a number of
Diamond Sparrows, Parson, Heck's, Long-tailed, Bichenow, and
Cherry Finches were reared ; also two pectoralis and one Blood-Finch
[phaeton ). The latter species is rather insectivorous and does not breed
too easily ; it is very spiteful and must be associated with stronger birds
only. Mine share their rather small aviary with Orange and other
Weavers and Whydahs, as well as Doves and Quails. Twenty-two
Gouldian Finches have so far been reared by five pairs and there still
are young and eggs in the nests. I find that several pairs do well
together in a small aviary, but no other species should be associated
with them. A European Bullfinch was also reared in the next aviary
from the one fertile egg of two clutches. A number of Painted Quails
were reared by the parents.
A pair of full-winged Mandarin Ducks reared nine young in the
large aviary over the stream, but the Hawaiian Mallards did not
succeed, again dropping a few eggs here and there. They have since
been sent to Cleres, as well as pairs of Germain's and Palawan Peacock-
Pheasants, as more suitable accommodation for such birds exists there.
A few new birds should be mentioned. In January I received a
Green Cotinga (Pipreola aureopectus) from Colombia, a present from
Mr. Ray Thomas, along with a male Purple Sugar-Bird and a male
Blue-rumped Green Tanager (Chlorophonia frontalis). I kept them
indoors in a large cage, then put them out in March. I find that in
the climate of Southern California delicate tropical birds must have
some artificial heat if they arrive during the winter. Once they have
spent a summer outdoors they stand the following winters perfectly,
and never need being brought in again. The Green Tanagers, usually
considered difficult to keep, do very well and live long on a diet of
crushed banana, egg, and pound cake, with the addition of grapes and
other soft fruit. I also have a Red-bellied Niltava in perfect condition,
which is never given any mealworms ; it eats a great deal of cheese
and some fruit, particularly pear.
Cleres continues to be prosperous, therefore well kept and well
stocked. I was there part of June and July, and it looked much as it
did before the war, with the exception of some of the tropical houses
and the large paddocks across the road, which it has not yet been
possible to remake. Among the new arrivals are pairs of Leadbeater's,
Philippine and Moluccan Cockatoos, and a pair of Hawk-headed
Parrots. The collections of Pheasants and Waterfowl are growing and
a number of young have been reared ; 4 Magellan's, 8 Blue-winged,

By R. G. Kirkham (Clonskeagh, Co. Dublin, Eire)
This year I decided to put up two pairs of Bourke's Parrakeets ;
ly old breeding pair which had raised families for me for the past
hree years and a young unrelated pair of early 1954 birds. The old
nes went to nest immediately I put in their nest-box and the
oung pair followed suit about two weeks later. Five eggs were laid
&gt;y the old pair and four by the young pair and both hens sat well,
hree young were hatched in the first nest (one egg being clear and
le other dead in shell), and everything appeared to be going well
Ten Death reared its ugly head. I went down early one morning
nd discovered the hen lying dead on the aviary floor and the three
hicks calling loudly for food. The cock sat on a nearby branch and
irveyed the scene without interest, so I decided to transfer the three
hicks to the other hen, whose eggs were just on the point of hatching,
he accepted them without demur though I thought I detected a
^proachful look in her eye. At this stage of the proceedings every-
iing appeared to be going well so I departed on a business trip with
light heart.
Hen No. 2 had hatched two eggs out of her four during my absence
ad was then feeding all five, but the strain must have been too great
8 she was discovered dying one morning and before anything could
2 done for her she passed out, leaving five hungry mouths to feed,
t this point my wife became desperate and sought the aid of
Ir. Thomas McLaughlin, another Dublin member of our Society,
&gt; he had a pair of Bourke's with one chick. He quickly came over

in his car and took four survivors to his place (the youngest one having
died before his arrival). Foster-mother No. 2 now took over and reared
all four to maturity.
On the morning the first youngster left the nest Mi. McLaughlin
went in to feed as usual, but was not expecting to find a young bird
able to fly like a rocket, with the result that immediately he opened
the door the young rocket flashed past him and away into the morning
sunshine. I gather he spent the best part of the morning looking
for the truant without result, and so he resigned himselt to the loss
and comforted himself with the knowledge that at least he still had
three safe and sound. Hours passed--twenty-four to be exact, and
great was his joy to find on the following morning, the young Bourke's
hale, hearty and hungry, sitting on the wire roof awaiting admission.
This was quickly arranged and so the stock was again two adults
and four young. This happy state did not last for very long as, a few
days later, a hawk from the neighbouring woods dived down on the
aviaries and caused such panic that two of the youngsters flew madly
into the wire end of the compartment and were found shortly after-
wards with broken necks. This early demise of two promising
youngsters made Mr. McLaughlin very nervous of the remaining two
and most anxious to see then safely back in their original home. He,
therefore, caught them up and they are now living with their widowed
fathers in my birdroom. During all the moving about, they of couise
all became mixed up and I now don't know the relationship of the
young so they must not be mated together, as I feel veiy stiongly
that the stocks of Bourke's in the country should be carefully conserved
new blood introduced if possible, and that close breeding should be
avoided at all costs.

This paper is based on observations of Rock, Feral, and Domestic
figeons ( Columba livid), Stock-Doves (C. oenas) , Wood-Pigeons
C. palumbus), Laughing Doves ( Streptopelia senegalensis), and Turtle-
doves (S . turtur ), both in freedom and captivity, Speckled Pigeons
C. guinea ) and Spotted Doves (S&apos;, chinensis ) in captivity and domestic
larbary Doves (S . risoria ) allowed to fly at full liberty from April till
November. Briefer and more intermittent observations have been
nade on various other species, chiefly captive specimens in the London
&apos;00. My experience with the Spotted Dove has, however, been
estricted to four birds only, two of which I hand-reared last summer
date of writing this 31st October, 1955), and two adults that were
iven to me about the same time.
I am most grateful for assistance, either in the form of stimulating
iscussion on pigeon behaviour and/or in obtaining specimens, to
diss Terry Gompertz, Mr. Colin Harrison, Mr. G. T. Kay, Mr.
Lenneth Simmons, and Mr. Bertram Stone.
In my attempts to convey some idea of the sound of various calls
have used the following : " 66 " sounds like the shortened 00 in
foot " or " book " as pronounced in southern England, or as the
u " in " cut " or " rut " in northern English speech ; ' 4 66 " is a
mg 00 as in " boot " or " coot ". I have used " ee " for the sound
f the e in " keg " or " leg ", but rather more drawn out.
Display-Plumage
This term is here used for those areas of the plumage which serve the
urpose of intra-specific threat or sexual display. Such plumage (in
igeons) also serves its " everyday " functions, but I consider it
istifiable to term it "display-plumage" if (1) the modifications
lown have no apparent use other than in display, and (2) they are
xhibited in a display that is directed at or elicited by a fellow member
f the species and are emphasized by the specific movements of the
isplaying bird.
Display-plumage as above defined occurs most commonly on the
eck and upper breast. Here a very large number of species and
enera show areas of plumage differentiated by contrasting colour,
ixture, or form. These areas are always exhibited--usually by
iflating the neck and erecting the display-plumage--in the bowing-
isplay (q.v.). Black or iridescent markings on the wings are another
ommon form of display-plumage. They may be exhibited frontally

They do, however, probably serve a social function by attracting th
attention of others of the species to a flying or alighting individual
They are automatically displayed when the wings are opened, bu
there are no special movements involved. White or contrastin
markings on the tail may serve a similar function, but aie often
perhaps always--part of the display-plumage. They are exhibitej
either in the display-flight as in the various Turtle-Doves (. Streptopeli
sp.) or in the bowing display as with the various species of Geopeli
and the Wonga Pigeon ( Leucosarcia melanoleuca ).
The tendency for the lower back or rump to be pale in colour is s
widespread in birds of different groups as to suggest some fundamentJ
physiological cause. In many pigeons such pale areas have becom
developed as display-plumage, being emphasized by dark borders c
adjacent regions. The northern races of the Rock-Pigeon, the Wooc
Doves ( Turtur sp.) and the Masked Dove {Oena capensis) are example

Jggests a jerkiness of movement such as is shown by some game-
irds, and which is very different from the rather graceful deliberation
f pigeons. Heinroth's term " Parademarsch ", which I venture to
nglicize as " parading " seems therefore a much better one to use.
Tection of the feathers of the lower back and rump is also usual
nder these circumstances. The movements above described seem
robably due to tension caused by conflicting tendencies to approach
nd flee from the other bird. They serve, usually in conjunction with
ther more definite behaviour patterns, to indicate sexual readiness,
umping towards or away from the other bird is also characteristic

only in connection with the bowing display. In the Speckled Pigeon,
however, it is sometimes shown in aggressive situations.
The Stock-Dove and C. livia have a movement in which the folded
wings are lifted and held m the same horizontal plane as the back.
This is done--commonly in conjunction with parading--in response
to the approach of a flying bird of the same or sometimes an allied
--species from above and (usually) behind. This is doubtless in
origin a flight-intention movement. It serves now, however, to
display the black wing bars to the approaching bird.
The Wood-Pigeon and the Speckled Pigeon behave in the same
manner, lifting the head rather high, erecting the rump feathers, and
often making the slight side-to-side movement, but they only very
slightly open their wings, and do not lift and flatten them. These
species have no such signal markings on their wings, the white band
of the Wood-Pigeon and the white spots of the Speckled Pigeon
appearing to have no significance in this situation. The signal function
of the wing-lifting is at once apparent to the observer looking down
on the bird from above, when the sudden increased conspicuousness
of a Stock-Dove or naturally-coloured C. livia as it displays in this
way is almost startling.
Many other pigeons of different genera (e.g. Turtur , Oena, Claravis,
etc.) have black or shining wing patches similarly positioned to those
of the Stock-Dove. I anticipate that these will also be found to have
a display in which the wings are similarly exhibited.
The Display-Flight
Probably most pigeons have a display-flight, although so far it
has only been described in any detail for a few. In those species of
Columba and Streptopelia in which it is known it consists of flying with
clapping wing-strokes, during which the wings are widely spread and
move through a wider arc than usual, followed by or interspersed with
gliding forward and/or downward with wings, and usually the tail
also, outspread. I have discussed previously (Goodwin, 1955) the
apparent correlation between form of display-flight, habitat, and tail
markings.
As the Heinroths (1949) show, the use of the display-flight by C. livia
(as in other species) indicates that the bird using it is (normally) in
reproductive condition. The following are the stimuli that commonly
elicit the display-flight in a sexually active male of this species.
(1) When he notices another pigeon on the wing.
(2) When he sees his mate or another pigeon in display-flight
near-by.
(3) When about to alight at or near his home after having been
away foraging, or after having been taken away by man and thus
forced to fly back.

(4) When flying in company with his mate (possibly then also as
1 response to some of the other stimuli listed above).
(5) Immediately after copulation (in about 40 per cent of cases
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992910024390244" page_id="58072871"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
mly).
The female uses the display-flight in the first situation only if she is
mpaired and in reproductive condition and then less often and less
emphatically than a male in similar plight. Under all the other
;:ircumstances listed above she may use the display-flight if her mate
irst initiates this behaviour. I have never seen a paired female, in
eompany with her mate, begin to clap and glide unless he first did so.
The function of the display-flight is to advertise the presence of a
)ird in reproductive condition. Unpaired females are strongly
ittracted to a display-flying male. So, apparently, are lost or tired
pecimens, a fact that has long been known to unscrupulous pigeon-
lepers, who make use of unpaired males for stray-catching. Since
uch lost birds are usually repelled or frightened by the subsequent
exual advances of the male they have followed, it is probable that his
pparent attraction for them is due to his making reciprocal efforts to
naintain contact with them in flight, which other pigeons do not do.
t sometimes seems, however, that in C. lima, as in man, lost or
bewildered individuals have a tendency to follow any of their species
/ho shows a self-assured and determined manner. Such behaviour
/ould be useful to them since it would ensure that, sooner or later,
iiey would be led to an adequate feeding ground.
The mood of the display-flying bird seems self-assertive and sexual
father than aggressive, but there are indications that thwarted or
iblimated aggressiveness may at times be involved. The use of the
isplay-flight (sometimes) after copulation suggests this, as many
irds show aggressive or escaping movements at such time. In the
arly spring of 1955 workmen were repairing a tower in South
.ensington where many feral C. livia had their breeding and roosting
irritories. Again and again pairs, single birds, or small parties would
y over to try to return to their homes but be forced to retire for fear
f the men. Almost always the pigeons went into display-flight as,
r immediately after, they turned back from their objective. Two
ild Rock-Pigeons (probably males, as it was about mid-day) that
flushed (separately) from hatching eggs in South Uist went into
low intensity form of display-flight as soon as they were about
fty yards away from me. In these cases the wings, although passing
irough as wide an arc, did not smite the air with such vigour and no
udible clapping resulted. Such low intensity versions of the display-
ight are often shown by a young Domestic Pigeon, if the group with
hich it is flying splits up and it is undecided for a few moments which
irds to follow.

22 D. GOODWIN-THE VOICE AND SOME DISPLAYS OF CERTAIN PIGEONS
It thus seems likely that those elements of the display-flight which
actually slow down forward movement--the wide slower wing beats,
spreading tail, gliding instead of beating the wings--originate in a
conflict between tendencies to move away from and to remain in or
return to a certain area. Although in its perfect form the display-
flight appears now to be quite ritualized it is nevertheless still shown
--at least in its low intensity forms--as a response to such stimuli.
The vigorous smiting of the wings shown in the normal display flight
is due to self-assertive, or perhaps aggressive, impulses being super-
imposed on the (presumably) more primitive " slowing down " of
the flying movements.
The causation of the display-flight and mood of the bird performing
it appear to be similar in other species as that suggested above for
C. livia. In those which defend a larger territory such as the Collared
Dove (Hofstetter, 1952 and 1954) the display-flying bird more often
carries over into attacking behaviour. In these species it is possible
that the mood of the bird in display-flight is more overtly aggressive
than seems to be the case with C. livia. I think, however, that the
fundamental mood is self-assertive and only changes to aggression as
a result of further stimuli (such as recognizing the bird whose appear-
ance elicited the display-flight to be a stranger). Even the Streptopelia
species will display-flight at times over " neutral " ground, as the
Wood-Pigeon and Stock-Dove, as well as C. livia, frequently do.

The Defensive-threat Display
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989687" page_id="58072872"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
In my previous discussion of this in the Barbary Dove (Goodwin,
1952) I called it the " Fear-threat display ". The present title seems
rather better, however, being descriptive of its function. Erection of
the plumage, lifting of one or both wings and spreading of the tail are
shown. This display is given when the bird is activated by conflicting
impulses to attack and to escape and is commonly shown most
intensely to potential nest predators. A very great number of birds
and mammals have an homologous and similar display. Later
observations confirm Darwin's statement when discussing this
behaviour (Darwin, 1872) : " These appendages (i.e. fur or feathers)
are erected under the excitement of anger or terror ; more especially
when these emotions are combined . . . the action serves to make the
animal appear larger or more frightful."
The components of this display are easily analysed. The erection of
the feathers apparently indicates a conflict situation in which the
greater the conflict the greater the erection of the plumage. The
drawn-in position of the head and its frequent orientation towards
the alarming object are preparations for attack or active defence.
The lifting of the wing may serve mechanically to help keep balance
if the bird strikes out with the nearer wing. It is caused, however, by

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998843577777778" page_id="58072873"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
the impulse to flee. Should this tendency increase, both wings will
be lifted. Then a slight increase of the frightening stimuli and the
bird will " lose its nerve " and leap into the air with a quick downward
istroke of its wings.
From the time they are about half-feathered, nestling pigeons react
to the appearance of a frightening object with a very similar display.
They rear themselves up, erect the feathers, especially on the neck,
inflate and deflate their necks (though not to the same degree as an
adult when cooing) snap their bills, and may peck or strike at the
intruder. Young able--or nearly able--to fly, will flee from the nest
under such circumstances, although they may give this display if
they are cornered in a cage or in a nest-cavity. Because under such
conditions adults would flee, an exactly similar display to that of the
young is seldom shown by them. Under certain circumstances they
may, however, behave exactly as do nestlings. When I was training
my Red-eyed Doves to roost in the shelter it was necessary to put them
therein each night. To avoid handling them I endeavoured to do this
by lifting each under the breast so that it perched on the hand and
allowed itself to be carried. The birds were nervous and would
sometimes panic and fly wildly into the darkness, but frequently it
was possible to carry the bird in this manner. Often in such cases,
however, it showed its fear in ct infantile " manner by erecting its
feathers, inflating and deflating its neck with quick gasping puffs and
snapping its bill. An adult Stock-Dove with an injured wing was
brought to me. Although unbroken, one wing seemed incapable of
movement, and presumably any attempt to move it caused pain.
If I approached when it was on the ground the bird would run
quickly away, but if on a perch it performed the " nestling's " defensive
display. It did this also when carried on the hand, particularly if
lifted close to my face. This lasted only a few days. As soon as the
wing began to heal it ceased to behave thus, but would flutter down
off its perch if approached and would no longer permit itself to be
lifted on the hand.
The difference in motivation between the defensive-threat display
of free, uninjured adults, and that of nestlings (or of adults under such
conditions as described above) seems to be that in the first the birds'
aggressive impulses are conflicting with the impulse to flee. In the
second it is incapable of escaping either through physical incapacity
ar through fear of something else (e.g. taking wing in the dark, the
pain of using an injured wing) conflicting with fear of the object.
The factor common to both cases is the inhibition of a very strong
:endency to flee. The similarity in the movements and behaviour
shown, suggest that this situation arouses a similar emotional mood
in the bird whether the inhibiting factor is an overt force or its own
aggressive tendencies.

The Bowing-Display
This is common to many species of pigeons, perhaps to all. In it the
bird, facing the object of its display, lowers its head, at the same time
exhibiting its display-plumage frontally, and often uttering a character-
istic cooing call. At the lowest point of each bow the bird s bill may
be at right angles to the ground (e.g. Barbary Dove, Rock-Pigeon)
Bowing-displays (position at lowest point of the bow) of Barbary Dove, Red-eyed
Dove, Bar-shouldered Dove, Plumed Ground Dove, and Common Crowned Pigeon.
or at any angle between that and a slight upward one as in the Bar-
shouldered Dove ( Geopelia humeralis). In all the species of Columba
and Streptopelia whose bowing is known to me there is marked inflation
of the neck and/or erection of neck feathers, serving to show the display
plumage (see sketch). The Crested Pigeon ( Ocyphaps lophotes) and the
Common Bronze-wing ( Phaps chalcoptera ) show no marked inflation
of the neck or erection of its feathers but slightly open their wings and,
present them frontally so that the brilliant display-plumage, which
in these species is on the wings and not on the neck, flashes into view.
To appreciate the bowing-display fully it must be seen from the front
and at " pigeon's eye level ". Then even the black bill, white cere,
and orange eyes, set against a shining globe of vivid green and purple,
that a Domestic Pigeon (of the wild colour) presents is striking and
almost awe-inspiring.

lateral rather than frontal. Also at the culmination of the bow the
head is completely upside down (see sketch). The bird spreads and
erects its tail and half opens its wings, utters a very deep, short
Oohmp-oohmp " and bows its head quickly forward and round to
the inverted position. The spread tail is slightly tilted to one side
towards the object of the display and the inverted head is, at least
sometimes, also slightly tilted so as to present it to best advantage.
The display is thus essentially the same as that of the Australian
Bronzewings except in its lateral orientation which is correlated with
the laterally flattened crest rather than the wing and tail markings,
being the major feature. As I have only seen this display about a
dozen times, and from the same captive specimen (not in my
possession), the possibility that it may, at high intensity, be frontal
like that of other pigeons cannot be entirely excluded. I think this is
unlikely, however, for two reasons. Firstly the crest can hardly be
shown to advantage in a frontal display, and secondly the display I
watched seemed very fervent and the displaying bird displacement-
preened behind its wing after each bow, thus suggesting that the full
sexual display had been given. It is interesting that in the different
species of Goura crest development is in inverse relation to the bright-
ness of the wing patch. Doubtless the others have a similar bowing-
display to that of G. cristata.
Although the bowing-displays of the different species are now of a
stereotyped nature most of their components seem to have been
derived from locomotory or intention movements. The crouching
posture assumed at the culmination of each bow, as has been pointed
3ut elsewhere (Daanje, 1950), probably originated in the preparatory
movement for jumping or flying up or forward. In some species,
such as the Bar-shouldered Dove, the posture adopted makes this
airly obvious. In most the position of the head destroys this impression
ind perhaps indicates a more complete ritualization of this part of
he display. Inflation of the neck seems a necessary concomitant of
:ooing, and, together with the erection of the neck feathers, often also
serves to exhibit the display-plumage. We have seen, however, that
leek inflation (to a lesser degree) and erection of the neck plumage is
Town by young, and sometimes also adult pigeons, when the impulse
o escape is thwarted. It seems likely, therefore, that these elements
)f the bowing-display originated in, and may still indicate, a conflict
ituation in which aggressive or sexual impulses inhibit an impulse
o escape.
Spreading of the tail occurs during the bowing display in Geopelia ,
- eucosarcia , Lophophaps , Ocyphaps , Goura , and some species of Columba.

26 D. GOODWIN-THE VOICE AND SOME DISPLAYS OF CERTAIN PIGEONS
Wood-Pigeon and Stock-Dove (see sketch) the tail is spread during
its upward movement but usually closes again prior to its maximum
erection. In C. livid the spread tail is depiessed, and so is hardly
visible to the bird displayed at. The Snow-Pigeon ( Columba leuconota)
raises but does not spread its strikingly marked tail when bowing
(Newman, 1911). The Speckled Pigeon spreads and depresses its
tail in a similar manner to C. livid but to a lesser degree. No spreading
of the tail occurs in any of the Streptopelid species whose bowing-display
is known to me (S. senegalensis, chinensis , decdocoto, orisorid , semitorqudta ,
and turtur) . Since that acute observer, Newman, does not record it
for S. pictumtd and S. decipiens (Newman, 1908 and 1909) it is safe to
assume it does not occur in these either.
The lifting and frontal presentation of the wings, such as is shown
by the Crested Pigeon, Common Bronzewing, and Plumed Ground-
Doves Lophophdps sp. is undoubtedly derived from the intention-
movement of taking flight. Wffiether directly as in the wing-lifting
of some Columbd species (which do not show this movement in their
bowing displays) or secondarily via the wing-movements of the
begging juvenile could perhaps be determined by further study of
the various 44 Bronzewings ".
Spreading and erection of the tail--which are often combined
appear likely to have derived from movements shown when alighting,
or checking in flight. Mhny pigeons and other biids usually throw
up the tail when they alight. In the Wood-Pigeon this movement,
even in 44 everyday " life, has evolved to the point where it appears
to have a psychological rather than a physiological significance.
Instead of throwing up the tail at the moment of alighting as do, for
example, the Crested Pigeon and the Blackbird Turdus meruld , the ,
Wood-Pigeon does so a few seconds after. This it appears to do when
sufficiently at ease to have 44 decided " to remain--at least for the
moment--where it is. If alarmed or sexually excited at the moment
of alighting the W ood-Pigeon often remains perched for a considerable
period without making this tail movement. In the bowing-display
raising of the tail is correlated with a cessation of movement towards
the object. Thus the movement still retains something of its (presumed)
original significance.
Spreading of the tail is connected with a tendency to escape from,
or at least avoid closer contact with the object. This is evident in
C. livid. In this species the spreading of the tail in no way enhances
the display's optical effect, but is shown especially at the moments
of closest approach. It is almost certain that spreading of the tail
has its origin in escaping impulses. Probably such a tendency to
escape is still always felt by the bird at the times when it spieads or
raises its tail. (Of course I am not suggesting that such a tendency
to escape is accompanied by a mood anything like that evoked by a

predator. Ihe subjective feelings accompanying such escaping
tendencies are doubtless more akin to those of ours which we call by
such terms as " diffidence ", " modesty ", " bashfulness ", and so
forth than to true fear.) In many wading birds (Simmons, 1955)
spreading of the tail occurs in displays evoked by conflicting impulses
to flee and to attack.
A high lifting of the feet, often with a " marking time " effect
accompanies the bowing-display of many species (Whitman, 1919).
In Columba and Streptopelia , probably also in others, these are intention-
movements of mounting. This is clearly shown when the displaying
bird carries straight over from the bowing-display to copulation
without interposing the mating ceremony. Consideration of the
bowing-display of some species in more detail will serve to substantiate
the above remarks. It is, of course, necessary to schematize slightly
and it must be borne in mind that many minor variations can, and
often do, occur, depending on the condition and personality of the
displaying bird and the reactions of the object of its attentions.
C. livia
In this species the bowing-display has three distinct, but inter-
grading forms. These might conveniently be termed the sexual, self-
assertive, and defensive. These terms are rather arbitrary and must
not be deemed exclusive ; self-assertiveness is certainly present in the
" sexual " and " defensive " forms of the display, and a state of sexual
activity is a prerequisite for the self-assertive form.
In the sexual version the male flies in display-flight towards the
object, alights near it and runs or leaps towards it, cooing loudly with
inflated neck and feathers of neck, rump, lower back and (usually)
belly erected. On reaching it he lifts his head high, but with bill still
pointed somewhat downwards. Then he turns in a quick circle, bowing
low and cooing, then again lifts his head and turns away. Quick
nodding head movements are shown during momentary pauses in the
display movements. If the bird displayed to moves away he flies, runs,
or jumps towards it again. If it remains still, so that he is displaying
on the same spot, the spreading and depressing of the tail are usually
:orrelated with the upward movement of the head. If the other bird
does not give a positive sexual response the displaying bird is likely
:o attack it if they are in or near his territory or to lose interest if they
ire on some neutral ground. He may try to initiate the mating
:eremony and/or to copulate and will almost invariably do so if the
object of his display invites such behaviour. A female that is eager
0 pair may respond to the bowing display with attempts to initiate
he mating ceremony even before the male begins to open his bill or
lisplacement-preen. If she is very eager to mate she will crouch and
nvite coition as soon as the male begins to display.

28 D. GOODWIN-THE VOICE AND SOME DISPLAYS OF CERTAIN PIGEONS
This form of the bowing-display is given by a male in reproductive
condition to known females other than his mate, and of course by
unpaired males, in whom alone it serves a biologically useful function
by indicating their readiness to mate and nest to an unpaired female,
to strange birds of either sex and more rarely to other males known
to him. He often gives it to his own mate, but usually very briefly and
not intensely, as a prelude to an attempt to initiate the mating
ceremony. If his mate is removed (by human agency) for some houis
or days he will usually display at very full intensity to her when they
are put together again. It appears that a certain specific state of
excitement (which seems to occur when sexual, self-assertive, and
escaping impulses are simultaneously aroused) is needed to elicit the
full intensity bowing-display and that such a condition is not very
often evoked by the bird's own mate. Other vertebrates show com-
parable behaviour. The female does not often show this form of the
bowing-display. Exceptionally she may display in this manner to her
own mate immediately after both have been giving the self assertive
form in reference to neighbours who have aroused their anger. Heie
one has the impression that the female is very strongly inclined to
attack and only " respect " for her mate prevents her from pecking
him. This suggests that the postures adopted are primarily caused by
thwarted aggressive and escaping impulses and are linked with strong
sexual impulses because it is normally only when these are present
that attacking and/or fleeing tendencies can be so strongly aroused
and yet held in check. Very similar posturing is used by the hen
pigeon when joining her nest-calling mate on the nest-site as has been
pointed out by the Heinroths (1949) and Levi (1940). Here again
the spreading and depressing of the female's tail seem to indicate
a thwarted impulse to escape. That aggressive tendencies are also
present is shown by the fact that, as she jumps or runs up to her mate
she often pecks him quite roughly (the displaying male may also peck
at the female as he reaches her before or instead of turning away)
and if she does not she caresses him, which is a sublimated form of
aggressiveness (see Goodwin, 1956).
In the " self-assertive " form of the bowing-display the bird turns
round and round, cooing, with lowered head but shows little or no
lifting of the head--except in between bouts of cooing and turning -
or spreading of the tail. This display may " die away or lead on
into the intense sexual form or into fighting or advertisement-cooing.
It is given by a male in reproductive condition under the following
circumstances : Immediately after alighting in or near his territory
or in some often frequented area where he feels self-assured. When
(being in such an area) he sees another pigeon--particularly a stranger
or a known male whom he dislikes--approaching. A male returning

tormer home, often displays in this manner on alighting even if no
bther pigeons are in sight. I must, however, make the reservation
:hat on the occasions that I have seen this the birds concerned were
fame specimens and the possibility that their display had reference
:o me cannot be entirely excluded. In no other circumstances have
1 seen this display given by a bird completely alone.
This form of the bowing-display seems to be primarily self-assertive.
The German terms " Imponiergehabe " and " Prahlgehabe " are apt
but it is misleading to translate them (as is often done) as " threat
lisplay " or " aggressive display True the displaying bird is in a
condition where it will usually attack " at the least provocation "
put it is, as a rule, equally ready to show non-aggressive forms of
exual behaviour. The turning round and round might perhaps have
lerived from alternating impulses to flee and to attack. But it now
ippears to have become quite ritualized and " automatic ". It is
*qually possible, however, that this circular movement may be
primarily functional, being the most efficient method of presentation
or a colonial or semi-colonial species in which the displaying individual
is likely to have potential rivals or mates on either side of it.
The third, or defensive form of this display consists merely in
owering the head in the bowing position and uttering the self-
ssertive " 0 o-rbo-coo-t'coo ! " Normally the bird so doing faces
ts enemy, but may turn partly from it. This display is shown as a
&gt;relude to attack or in defiance, and is not restricted to birds in
eproductive condition.
The female uses the self-assertive and defensive forms of the bowine-
.isplay, but seldom except when at her own perch or nest-site. In the
elf-assertive version she seldom moves round in a complete circle,
s the male usually does, but makes a partial turn and then back again
irough the same arc.
he Speckled Pigeon
In its most intense sexual form the bowing-display of this species
\0x25A0 very similar to (and doubtless homologous with) the corresponding
isplay of C. livia. The tail is not, however, often spread so fully or
epressed to the same extent. At the close of each cooing phrase, as
lifts its head, the bird makes quick jerking movements of its head
3 either side. These movements are so rapid that it is difficult to
&gt;llow them in detail. They seem to have a lateral as well as a forward
3 mponent and may perhaps be a combination of intention-move-
lents of mounting and of turning away. Immediately after lifting
s head the bird often turns half round away from the object of its
isplay and may make a complete circle like C. livia although more
Iten it turns back through the same arc as does the female of C. livia
l the self-assertive form of bowing-display.

In the versions that correspond to the self-assertive and defensive
forms of this display in C. livia, there is little or (more often) no
spreading of the tail and the bird faces its potential adversary and does
not turn round and round. It may, however, if there are others to
both sides of it, give one cooing phrase and then turn round quickly
to bow and coo towards another individual. So far as I have seen
this display is always directed at a particular bird or birds, whereas
in C. livia, although usually evoked by the sight of a^ particular
individual, the circling and cooing often seems directed at " all whom
it may concern Defensive or threatening versions of this display
are, as in C. livia, not confined to birds in reproductive condition.
The female Speckled Pigeon, who is quite as aggressive and quarrel-
some as her mate, if not indeed more so, uses the self-assertive and
threatening forms of the bowing-display as freely as the male. She
spreads and depresses her tail in the same manner as C. livia whei
joining the male on the nest-site.

before each the male raises his head with neck feathers erected (see
sketch) in much the same posture as C. livia. He does not, however,
turn around or away from the female. In less intense forms the tail
may be only slightly raised and the bow not be preceded or followed
by the erect posture. If the position of their perches hinders a frontal
presentation, or the bird is inclined to withdraw from a fight, the
display may be given sideways on, but with a slight orientation of
head and body towards the object evoking it. Another Stock-Dove
alighting near will often evoke a self-assertive bow from a territory-
owner and this bow may be unorientated. The stimuli eliciting the
bowing are the same as those already given for C. livia but in the
Stock-Dove one has the impression that self-assertiveness and threat
are always dominant over any escaping tendencies that may be
present in the displaying bird. Even in the intense versions the male
Stock-Dove does not turn away from the female, but frequently
follows up the display by pecking or striking her. The bowing-display
elicits a sexual response in the female (parading) but I have not seen
it stimulate her to invite coition immediately. Probably it would,
however, do so under parallel circumstances to those evoking such a
response in domestic C. livia . The female uses the bowing-display
under the same situations as does the female C. livia, but lather less
freely.
The Wood-Pigeon
The bowing-display is almost identical with that of the Stock-Dove,
but the male will more often go into the bowing posture and utter the
display coo without raising his tail if walking after a moving biid he
wants to display to. At such times--as also during purely aggressive
encounters--he frequently leaps towards the other bird. He does not
spread and depress his tail when approaching another bird. His
display seems to have the same significance as the Stock-Dove's, but
rather more frequently leads directly to billing and copulation. I have
not seen a known female give this display, but as I have not kept tame
breeding pairs of this species, this is no proof that she does not do so.
The Doves of the Genus Streptopelia
The bowing-displays of the Barbary and Collared Doves (see
Goodwin, 1952, and Hofstetter, 1954) are identical, although their
voices (q.v.) differ in sound. The bird alternately bows low and draws
itself up to full height. At the lowest point of the bow the black collar
is visible from in front, framing the lowered head.. The tail is not
spread, lowered, or raised, though it moves a little in time with the
body movements. In the Red-eyed Dove the bows are quicker and
shallower and at the culmination of each the head is horizontal or
nearly so. From the front one can see only the lateral portions of the
black collar, but these, and the pale blue-grey forehead, are very

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990632177777777" page_id="58072883"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
conspicuous. It is probably no coincidence that in this species the
J median aiea of the black collar is narrower and often obsolescent.
In the 1 urtle-Dove the tempo of the display is very quick, the bows
lare rapid and bobbing and the erected display plumage forms a black
and silver ruff on either side of the head. In the Spotted Dove the
bows are slower than in the Turtle-Dove, but not quite so (relatively)
erate as in the Barbary and Collared Doves, and the
display plumage forms a broad collar framing the head. In its
close lelative the Laughing Dove the bows are shallower and the
bead kept more nearly horizontal, in correlation with which we find
the display plumage on this species is on the front and sides of the neck.
In these (r and all other Streptopelia species) the bowing-display is
primarily sexual. In the Barbary, Collared, and Turtle-Doves
[probably also in the other species too) receptive females often respond
jy inviting coition without bothering about further ceremony. Any
esponse other than an appropriate sexual one usually causes the
lisplaying bird to attack. When it does so, however, it invariably
:eases to bow and coo, goes into its aggressive posture with lowered
lead, and (Spotted and Laughing Doves excepted) utters its excitement
cry. These doves never bow and coo at one another " between
*ounds " when fighting, as the European species of Columba and the
ipeckled Pigeon commonly do. Although it is, especially in territorial
ituations, so frequently followed by attacking, there are, I think,
10 grounds for supposing that a Streptopelia feels aggressive when it
;ives its bowing display. It appears rather that it only becomes angry
vhen, and because , its sexual impulses are thwarted by an inappropriate
esponse. We know from both observation and introspection that in
Tan a change of subjective mood to one of anger may often be
nstantly evoked when any impulse is thwarted, particularly if such
mpulse had a strong instinctive basis. In this respect birds and Man
ippear to have much in common.
The lack of any exhibition of the tail (in this particular display) by
he Streptopelia species is additional evidence that such spreading
md/or erection of the tail is in fact indicative of a tendency to escape
*r at least avoid closer contact with, the object evoking the display,
conversely the lack of such a movement in these doves confirms the
pinion, based also on other observations, that little, if any tendency
o escape or to attack, is present when they give the bowing-display,
t might be added that the Streptopelia species usually throw the tail
P when they alight, they exaggerate this movement if they are
exually or aggressively excited, and they have boldly patterned outer
lil feathers which are spread and exhibited during display-flight,
heir non-use of the tail when bowing cannot therefore be due to lack
f " raw material " for selection and incorporation into this display.

By Mathew Mitchell (Edinburgh, Scotland)
During the winter of 1953 I obtained a pair of Abyssinian Lovebirds
from Mr. Salteri. . r .1 .
From the start this pair was very docile, displaying none of the
usual timidity of the majority of lovebirds.
In April of the following year they began to take an interest in the
nest-box I then provided them with suitable twigs w ic t ey
proceeded to strip. After a time the activities of the hen ceased and
for long periods she was not seen. By that I guessed she might be
incubating, perhaps it would be more truthful to say I hoped. I had
previously read in various books that Abyssmians were not at all
free-breeders, being somewhat shy by nature. Consequently I lesiste
the temptation to look, in spite of the fact that they were not the least
bit shy, indeed they were almost parrot-like in their docility. By Ju
I knew that there were young, as I could hear faint cheeping sounds
coming from their enclosure. By August three sturdy youngsters
emerged which subsequently turned out to be two hens and one coc c.
On examining the nest-box I found one egg which contained a dead i
chick. I cleaned out the nest-box and put it back in position, bu
no further attempt was made at nesting that year.
I should at this point try to give a rough idea of the construction
of the aviary ; the overall dimensions are 8 ft. 6 in. long, 6 It. b m.
high by 6 ft. 6 in. wide ; this is divided into three compartments o
equal size, a third of the dimensions of each of these flights being
built of wood to afford shelter ; in the other two compartments are
Fischer's and Masked Lovebirds.
This year the Abyssinians began nesting operations at an eary
date by the end of February they were once more building, and by
the end of April two more young appeared, this time both hens.
Again, as last year, four eggs were laid ; of the remaining two eggs
one contained a dead chick, the other was infertile. As m the previous
year no further attempt was made at nesting despite the fact that the
summer was still ahead. Can it be that this species is single brooded
Also this season the pair nested outside in the wire enclosure, but ot
Fischer's and Masked nested in the enclosed part of the aviary.
Apart from the usual seed mixture and seeding grasses they were also
fond of apple. One day there were a few canned figs m syrup le 1
over from lunch, these I gave to the Abyssinians thinking that since
they took apple readily they might also like figs. I was not long e
in doubt, both fell to with great gusto and have ever since evinced z
partiality to this fruit.

The death during the autumn of the Blue-billed Malimbus, brought
from British Cameroon in 1948 by Mr. Webb, brings to mind a curious
error in the Centenary Edition (1929) of the Society's List of Verte-
brated Animals. In this edition the Combasou, which must by then
have been exhibited many times, was omitted and Malimbus nitens was
included. This, as pointed out by the late Dr. Hopkinson in the
Avicultural Magazine (1932, p. 291) had then "probably never
been kept in captivity even in its own country, except perhaps for a
day or two by Mr. Bates' native catchers ". He attributed the confusion
to the specific name nitens , formerly given to the Combasou. Knowing
from experience how very difficult it is to establish newly caught
specimens of the Blue-billed Malimbus, I would have no hesitation in
believing Mr. Webb's bird to be the first ever exhibited in Regent's
Park.
Dr. G. R. Walker says that " These Weavers rout out insects from
among the leaves ", but, like a number of other birds, they also eat
the oily husk of palm nuts and are caught by natives in snares baited
with these nuts. I was brought several and there was never any
difficulty in getting them to feed on grasshoppers, the large fat larvae
of the palm weevil, termites, palm nut husk and fruit, but in spite of
eating quantities of these foods all became thin and none lived for
more than about a fortnight. The birds have powerful bills, so could
no doubt eat large beetles, cicadas, and perhaps even small tree-frogs.
The sexes are alike in plumage and the red throat feathers of
Mr. Webb's bird did not fade appreciably during the seven years that
it was in the Bird House. Bannerman calls this Malimbus " Gray's
Blue-billed Weaver " : it is widely distributed over the forests of
West Africa.
Of the arrivals, four are species new to the collection :--
Yellow-billed Oxpecker ( Buphagus africanus). Three of these curious
birds, the first of the Oxpeckers to be exhibited in the Gardens, were
collected in Uganda by Mr. and Mrs. Bloom. There are two forms
of the Yellow-billed, which actually has a bright glossy red and yellow
bill, and two of the Red-billed. They are also known as Tick-birds or
Rhinoceros-birds and are widely distributed over tropical and sub-
tropical Africa in fairly open country frequented by the larger wild
and domesticated mammals.
Ruwenzori Hill-babbler ( Pseudoalcippe atriceps). This bird was also
collected by Mr. and Mrs. Bloom in the mountainous district of
south-western Uganda. It also occurs in the Kivu district and the
hills and mountains of eastern Cameroon.

a Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca ), one of the forms of the African ;
Grey-headed Sparrow (Passer griseus), a pair of Redstarts, and a pair
of Greenland Wheatears.
Large Olive Bulbul (Pycnonotus plumosus). A specimen of this Bulbul
was presented by Sqdr. Ldr. K. G .Searle who also gave two Japanese
Red-flanked White-eyes (Zosterops erytkropleura), a Melodious Jay-thrush
(Trochalopteron canorus ), a Chinese Blue Pie (Urocissa melanocephala ),
another Long-tailed Parrakeet and a pair of Nicobai Parrakeets.
A Falcated Teal has been presented by the Leckford Estate, Ltd., and
a tame hen Large Minivet (Pericrocotus speciosus) by Capt. R. S. de Q,.
Quincey.
A brightly coloured specimen of the Red-throated Parrot (Amazona
collaria) and a Shag that was picked up in Hertfordshire after some
rough weather have also been presented.
A young pair of Great Bustards (Otis tarda), an Egyptian Vulture,
and two Egyptian Plovers, or Crocodile-birds, have been leceived
in exchange.
The Crocodile-birds were formerly said to enter the mouths of
crocodiles to feed on leeches and to pick particles of food from the
reptiles' teeth, but modern observers say this is not so and one wonders
whether the birds ever did undertake these dangerous excursions or
whether the habit has been changed.

Members of the Club : 25 ; guests, 26 ; total, 51.
David Reid-Henry gave a talk entitled " Hawking as a Recreation",
de commenced with a brief hypothetical account of a possible origin
&gt;f the practice of falconry--the true origin is virtually unknown,
de then demonstrated the furniture used, explained the uses of the
arious types and showed that modern practice is still very similar to
hat of the falconers of old. ddiis, in spite of the fact that falconry
o-day is, in the western world at least, very much a field-sport ;
whereas in times past is was one of the best means of supplementing the
arder and, consequently, was carried out as a serious matter of
lecessity.
Tracing the history of the sport in Great Britain Reid-Henry ex-
&gt;lained why there had been such a decline in popularity. He was,
owever, happy to report a considerable revival of interest in recent
ears.
A lengthy discussion followed in which Mrs. Watmough, Mrs.
rayne, Colonel Finch, Mr. Spence, Mr. Vane, and others took part.
But few of the audience had had any experience of falconry and
wid-Henry's discourse proved both very interesting and entertaining,
n addition, his Buzzard Charles Bump " and Peregrine " Dora "
aused something of a sensation. Altogether a very enjoyable meeting.
Fhe next meeting of the Club is on 14th March.

LES * r , S b XUX D ' EAU DE BELGIQUE. By Leon Lippens,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9612606" page_id="58072891"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
Second Edition. Published by E. Vercruysse-Vanhove., Saint-Andre-
lez-Bruges. 1954.
This second edition of Monsieur Lippens' book on the water-birds
of Belgium, which was published in 1941 and was soon out of print
is warmly welcomed. Monsieur Lippens, a naturalist of international
repute, who has studied birds all his life, is particularly fitted to write
on this group. As he says in his foreword to the first edition, for fifteen
years he had the opportunity of studying waterbirds in one of the best
regions of Belgium, on the coast near the Dutch frontier ; he was able
to watch them closely and constantly, and also ringed about 20,000
specimens. . In addition, when he was in the Belgian Congo, in the
Albert National Park from 1935-36, he made a special study of the
waterbirds, in particular the migrants which wintered there. Now with
the second edition of the book Monsieur Lippens has been able to add
the results of a further thirteen years of close association with the
waterbirds in the particularly favoured corner of Belgium where he
lives.
A full description of the distinctive characters, habits, and habitat
o each species is given, with detailed information regarding their
distribution in Belgium and more general regarding their distribution
in other countries. Nesting and migration are also dealt with fully
and valuable keys of identification are added. One hundred and
lorty-five species are included and the Latin, French, Flemish, English,
and German names of each are given. There are twenty-four coloured
plates by Mademoiselle Ingeborg Frederiksen and one coloured plate
depicting the heads of three species of Swans, by Comte Rodolphe van
er btegen de Shrieck. In addition are a number of maps to illustrate
migration of various species and some black and white drawings
showing differences in feather pattern of closely allied species by the
author. 7
Monsieur Lippens writes in a clear and simple style which those
W *^ e renc ^ 1S not ver Y strong should be able to read without too
much difficulty, and even those who cannot read the language will
?ain a great deal of information from this most excellent book.

By Stanley Lewis. Arthur H. Stockwell, Ltd., Ilfracombe,
Devon. Price 21 s.
This book contains the observations made by the author over
fifty years, but he was not destined to see the result of his labours
in print for he died in 1949, just before the manuscript cou e
completed. The notes and data were entrusted to W. C. Taunto ,
who writes the foreword and who, with the editorial assistance of
K. M. Willcox, has put them into book form.
Stanley Lewis was a keen ornithologist who lived in Somerset a
his long life and devoted a large part of his time to the study of bir s.
He had a wide knowledge of the distribution of the county s buds
and it was his wish to pass on this knowledge to others. The boo is
illustrated with twenty-three photographic plates and there is a usefu
map * species of birds are dealt with, some at greater length than \0x25A0
others. Reference to the distribution of the species in the county is
followed by a description of the bird, its song, calls, nest, eggs, an
food, and a list of the local names.
Though it is stated in the foreword the book is not intended to
be a history of all the species of birds which have ever been recorded
within the county of Somerset, but is simply a record of those breeding
birds which came to the notice of the late Stanley Lewis during e
past fifty years, it is certainly a useful addition to the county

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to fee
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name oj
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom.

(Brotogeris chrysopterus chrysopterus)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The genus Brotogeris , according to Peters (1937), contains seven
species with eight subspecies. Of immediate interest is B. chrysopterus
with three races :

Brotogeris chrysopterus tuipara (Gmelin).

Friedmann (1948) has since described a fourth race, B. c. tenuifrons ,
Rio Negro Parrakeet, which appears to be intermediate between

B. c. chrysopterus and B. c. tuipara.
Distribution. The range of B. c. chrysopterus is " Eastern Venezuela
and the Guianas, south to the north bank of the lower Amazon ",
and o fB.c. tuipara , with which in the past it has so often been confused,
" South bank of the lower Amazon from the Tapajoz to Para, and
through the coastal forest belt to north-eastern Maranhao " (Peters).
There is considerable variation in size in the species of the genus
Brotogeris ; the largest being the well-known All-green Parrakeet
(B. tirica ) 10-o inches, whereas the smallest are the Tui (B. st. thoma
st. thoma) and the Golden-winged ( B. c. chrysopterus ), both 6-8 inches.
In 1758 Edwards (1760) painted a parrakeet which he says had
been the property of one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and was
given to me by a servant after it died He believed it had not
hitherto been figured or described and applied the names " Golden-
winged Parrakeet ", " La Perrique aux Ailes d'Or ", and " Psittacus
minor alis aureis ". The plate is satisfactory apart from the fact that
it by no means does justice to the fine golden-orange primary-coverts.

A. A. PRESTWICH-GOLDEN-WINGED PARRAKEET
Brisson (1760) is the next to notice this species, giving descriptions
in French and Latin, presumably based on Edwards.
The present specific name was bestowed by Linnaeus in 1700, when
he named it Psittacus chrysopterus , at the same time wrongly giving its
habitat as India. From then onwards most of the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth century ornithologists included the species in their
WO rks--their observations, however, all too often merely being
repeated from Edwards. . .
Buffon (1779) calls it " La Perruche aux ailes d or and gives due
credit to Edwards, but otherwise says nothing of importance : Latham
(1781, 1790, 1822) gives condensed versions of Edwards : Levaillant
(1801) includes two plates of " La Perruche a tache souci ", male and
female ; that of the male is quite good, but the female, here stated to
lack the orange wing patch is, of course, depicted without, also the
under wing-coverts are shown as of a brightish blue and the two central
tail feathers as blue--this last also applies to the plate of the male ;
Levaillant tells us it is very common in Cayenne, and that large
numbers are sent to Europe, he thinks it the more surprising therefore
that the species is disregarded by ornithologists : Shaw (1812) gives
credit to and relies on Edwards : Vieillot (1817, 1823) does likewise :
Kuhl (1820) can do no better than give a description and name five
museums possessing skins of Psittacus Sosove : Swainson (1820-21) gives
a small, inferior plate of Psittacus Cayennensis , Cayenne Golden-wmged
Parakeet, and quotes Levaillant that the female is entirely green :
Lesson (1831), " Psittacule a tache souci," and Wagler (1832), Sittace
tuipara, jun., add little or nothing of importance. _
Dr. Finsch (1868) regarded B. chrysopterus merely as the juvenile oi
B. tuipara. In 1878, however, the Zoological Society of London
received a living chrysopterus , followed in 1879 by a tuipara. Sclater
(1879) was then able to show beyond doubt that the two were sub-
specifically distinct. There is a marked similarity, but chrysopterus
differs from tuipara in having a narrow frontal magm and chm-spot of
dark brown instead of orange ; it is also somewhat smaller. The female
is similar to the male ; immature the primary-coverts are said to be
green. .
Very little appears to have been written on the wild life of this
Parrakeet. Schomburgk (1848) states it is to be found throughout
British Guiana. It flies about near the coast in large flocks, and is
very fond of settling on the flowering Erythrina trees growing in the
coffee plantations, and greedily eating the flowers. Its nest is in the
holes of trees, and two to four eggs are said to form the clutch.
Lloyd (1895), Some Guiana Parrots , gives a note which may or ma\
not apply : " Several species of Brotogeris are also reported from th&lt;
colony, but they are small green birds hardly distinguishable fron
each other except in size, and not very interesting from the aesthetr

Doint of view. They generally lay their eggs in the deserted nests of
vood ants (termites)."
This is a rarely imported species, practically unknown to avicul-
unsts. It has been represented in the collection of the Zoological
&gt;ociety of London on at least two occasions. The first was received
n exchange in April, 1878, and a second by purchase in November,
888, since when there have probably been others. Thorough search
las failed to reveal the names of any private aviculturists who have

By Sydney Porter (Derby, England)
Searching through avicultural literature one finds little or no
reference to the nesting of Sunbirds in captivity, except for a single
instance in 19.2 when a pair of Purple Sunbirds nested in the aviaries
oTa Mr. Brook, at Hoddam Castle, in Scotland. This nesting was
unsuccessful as the eggs were infertile.
Possibly one of the main reasons why no attempt was made o
induce the birds to reproduce themselves was thatt m&apos; P r " fa d ^ S f
(before 1940) few hens were imported compared to the number ot
males Being such small, modest, and inconspicuous creatures, so
utterly different to their gorgeous mates, importers had not bothered
to brins - them into the country.
Now S a good many pairs of Sunbirds are imported by sailors on
Merchant Navy ships, who find that a few pairs brought over at a time
=alucrative business. In this way quite a few rare species are
to be Dicked up if one knows the contacts.
Unfortunately some of the men finding that the birds wi 1 survive
on honey alone, use this without bothering about the usual sunbird
nectar mixture, it being less trouble, and though the birds may arnw
in good condition, not many survive more than a few weeks afte
lm A*slfior with ideas of getting rich quickly brought over (or at least
tried to) 50 Malachite cocks in a single cage . . . when I saw the lew
which eventually reached these shores they looked like animate
bits of oily rags . . . After a week or two only one poor thing surviv
and lived^orover a year, during which time every effort was made
to aid its recovery, but in vain. . , ... , , n j
In the old days most people seemed to think these birds frail
delicate creatures needing a high temperature and much care
Actually few birds are easier to keep if certain rules are kep , an
are longer lived.
Since I found a way to propagate large quantities of small flie
I thought there would be little difficulty in getting Sunbirds t"
reproduce themselves. With that object in view a small range c
aviaries was built with warmed inner shelters . . . but alas tor tti
weakness of human nature, before the Sunbirds arrived on the seen
the aviaries were inhabited by other species. However, two avrane
were set aside in the end for their intended inmates, a pair of Mala
chites and a pair of Amethysts. . , . . ,. , *
As usual, the males treated their mates with the brutality whic
seems inherent in the nature of male Sunbirds. The hens wei
chased, chided, bullied, and beaten, and many times I have had .

rescue them from imminent death. At first a few flight feathers of
the males' wings were clipped but this made no difference. When the
flights were heavily cut the males would stand by the food pots and
keep their mates from feeding. Even putting two food receptacles
n made little difference, as the males sprang from one to another. If
&apos;his failed they would take up a stance by the opening between the
outside and inside of aviary and shelter and keep the hens outside.
Many times the little hen Malachite would hide under the news-
papers which covered the floor of the aviary shelter to get away from
ler wrathful spouse. Often she would come up to me and indicate
hat she wanted to feed, and I had to wait with her mate perched a
oot or two away, his body quivering with rage all the while, only to
mock her down as soon as I left.
The cock Amethyst would chase his mate around the outside
iviary with such rapidity that one only saw a misty circle, so terrific
vas their speed. After this had gone on for what seemed an endless
ime the hen would drop on to the ground exhausted, when she would
&gt;e seized upon and nearly buffeted to death.
When the males cannot catch their mates they set up an extremely
oud shrill and scolding chatter during the whole of daylight. This
s apt to be very fraying to one's nerves. Fortunately my aviaries are
ar enough away from the house so that one can't hear them. At last
he pairs had to be separated, as it seemed that nothing would deter
he males from eventually killing the hens.
The male Malachite is one of the few Sunbirds which goes into an
dipse plumage out of the breeding season. He moults his brilliant
very and takes on a dress very similar to the hen except he retains
is long tail and has some green on the wing-coverts. When he
eturns to his nuptial plumage there seems to be no moult. I have
e Pt many males in cages during the transition time and not a single
;ather has been dropped.
Gradually the shining, metallic green spreads over the whole of the
lumage. When handled there is no sign of the greyish feathers with
7 ich the bird has been clothed. One can only assume that there
a colour change in the feathers as there most certainly is with
&gt;elamere's Giant Whydah, for one can see the black pigment passing
p the shaft of the feathers and gradually diffusing over the whole of
ie feather.
When the male bird had assumed his breeding plumage and begun
isplaying the hen was put back into his aviary, when he at once went
jto an ecstatic and frenzied display, but in between this exhibition

a glass shade were the ornaments of the drawing-room of that g.
The head is thrown back with the long bill at right-angles to the back,
the tail is also raised parallel to the bill, and the wings held out from
the body though not spread. The long tail is swung like the pendulum
of a metronome, with the same clockwork rhythm. During this time
the bird pours out a very loud, sweet song very much like that ol a
Wren and equally out of proportion with the size of the bird. During
this period, though not always, the brilliant yellow pectoral plumes,
normally concealed, are brought into view and spread like two fans
on each side of the breast. This posing attitude is assumed many
hundreds of times throughout the day. ,
During the courtship the little hen would pluck up courage to beg
her mate to feed her, but I have never seen him do so, he usually
drives her away. As the season advanced she seemed less frightened
* f Atdie beginning of May the hen was observed to be carrying bits
of fibre in her beak, and one day I noticed what appeared to be t e
nucleus of a nest in a clipped privet bush about 3 feet from the ground.
There were a few fibres and dead leaves placed vertically in an
opening about in the middle of the bush. Various upholsterer s
materials were procured . . . coconut fibre, short black horse hair
(if given in long lengths birds usually hang themselves with this),
cotton wool, down, lint, wadding, and the fine black hair-like rootsio
maidenhair fern which the gardener was then repotting ; but what
pleased the bird most was kapoc, the beautiful silky down from t
seed pods of an African tree which the birds no doubt use in a natural
The hen went into an ecstacy of joy when this was put in the aviary
and upon seizing pieces she flew round and round in mad delight,
letting bits go and then darting after them again and chasing pieces
blown about by the wind. After the first frenzied defight died aw,ay
she commenced with tremendous energy to build the nest and a
intervals of from 10 to 20 seconds took alternate bits of kapoc and
fern root or fibre to the nest. She seemed to do no weaving or building
in the ordinary sense but her manner of work seemed to be a vigorous
" tucking-in " of the materials. At first a solid structure about the
size and shape of a pint basin on its side was made, there being no
shape or indication that it was to be a nest. Eventually, as the hen
worked on, an opening appeared in the middle, and in time t e nes
became a large sausage-shaped structure with a hole at one end, anfl
when completed in about a fortnight's time it had a kind^ ol pore.

pouch shaped inside and beautifully warm and downy. This nest
was rather loose in composition as the birds had not enough cobwebs
to bind it together on the outside as they do in a wild state. I tried to
gathei cobwebs, but this was a difficult task as it was early in the season.
A kind friend said I could go and gather cobwebs from one of his out-
buildings, in which there were a great many. So, armed with little
forks cut from bamboo bushes, I collected a great many. Alas, these
were old and dusty and when concentrated after the collection, they
appeared very black, and the hen refused to have anything to do
with them. Fearing that if we had a downpour of rain the nest
might become waterlogged, I took the precaution of putting a very
large sheet of plate glass over the part of the aviary where the
nest was. This was a good thing, for one night after the hen had been
sitting about a week or more we had a very heavy downpour which
lasted about twelve hours, and had the nest not been protected it
would have collapsed. This made one realize what a wise precaution
the binding together of the nest with cobwebs is, as this not only
holds the structure together but also makes a waterproof covering.
The silk used in Africa by Sunbirds comes from huge spiders' webs and
is much stronger and thicker than any found in this country. In fact
a few dozen strands twisted together are almost impossible to break.
No Sunbird s nest I saw in Southern Africa was anything like the
one made by my bird. They were usually purse shaped structures
hung by a rope of spiders web from the ends of branches at a good
height, stuck over with dead leaves, moss, and lichen, and often
ornamented with paper or bits of cloth. One I found was trimmed
with bits of fine lace the bird had collected from a veranda where the
farmer's wife did needlework.
The male Malachite took not the slightest interest in the nest
building and always ignored the hen's requests for food. By the
demeanour of the hen and her " pregnant " look, I thought an egg
was laid on the night of 24th May and another on the night of 26th
May, which is the normal clutch. But one day, when the pair were
30 th in the inner shelter where the food is kept, I ventured to put
ny finger in the nest and found there was only one egg. Of course,
nving to the shape of the nest, it was quite impossible to see the egg,
ind to have got it out would have meant seriously damaging the
*tructure. However, even in a wild state sometimes only one egg is laid.
This must indicate that this Sunbird has few if any natural enemies,
md is not to be wondered at as few birds have a swifter flight. The
*ck seems to fly at a prodigious speed and in a way resembles a great,
^reen dragon fly ; in fact when trying to catch this bird in an aviary
his resemblance seems very real, especially as the wings make almost
he same heavy buzzing as a dragon fly does when it has flown
nto a room and is trying to escape.

Though about 10 inches long the contour of the male is so elegant
and beautifully streamlined that it could be passed through a large
finger ring ; I can think of no other bird so beautifully sleek and
slim but this is only when it is in perfect health.
There are several other species of Sunbirds found in Kenya, bu
they lack the beauty of the South African bird They are darker m
colour and lack the beautiful golden scintillation and wry trim
shape, this is mainly because the tails are longer and not stiff like the
other bird, in fact some have the central tail feathers almost as long and
flexible as those of the Pin-tailed Whydah when in nuptial plumage.
About the food on which my Sunbirds are fed ; there have been
many nectar mixtures advocated but one evolved by my friend
Mr Fred Logan, of Nottingham, seems to be the best, and on this
food I have never lost a Sunbird except through accident. In regard
to this food, for the morning mixture I mix two teaspoons each oi
Mellin's and Horlick's Food into a paste with water, then add two
dessert-spoons of pure English honey (this is most essential as imported
honey has preservatives in it which are harmful to the birds), a small
portion of " Yeastrel " or Marmite about the size of a small pea,
and this is dissolved in a pint of hot water; when the mixture has
gone cool a few drops of " Abidec " are added. For the afternoon
mixture one dissolves in a pint of hot water two dessert-spoons o
Nestie's Milk (Sweetened), two teaspoons of Melhn s Food, and one
dessert-spoon of English honey. Larger quantities can be made and
kept in a refrigerator and fed to the birds as wanted, but it rnus
have the chill taken off before it is put in the cages or aviaries. My
birds have flourished exceedingly since I used this mixture, and quite
a few have shown signs of nesting. When in an outdoor aviary (with
a heated shelter) I find live food of great benefit. This is produced
by taking old buckets and half filling with rotten fruit, banana skins,
grapefruit peel, etc., and fish heads, and covering the bucket with wire
netting. Soon one has a constant supply of small and large flies ,
needless to say my aviaries are not near the house. Once I use o
hang small all-wire cages up in the aviaries with fish heads in them,
but the birds used to put their long bills through the wire and with
their long tongues lick these unsavoury objects, so I thought it bettei
to substitute the buckets. I have tried to breed fruit flies for some o
my Sunbirds which are in cages in the birdroom, but this has nevei

After the egg was laid I searched through all the ornithologies
literature in my library on the birds of South Africa, especially t &lt;

hatched, both from the shape of the nest and the position it was in.
The nearest I could find was 12 days for Zosterops which are supposed
to be allied to the Sunbirds.
The little hen sat steadily and was not frightened off the nest by
anyone approaching, though she was usually off to greet me when the
morning food was taken round.
The cock took up his stance in some branches above the nest,
which is probably a natural thing for him to do in a wild state, to
drive off enemies or to give warning to the hen on the approach of
danger. He was very annoyed when she left the nest for any time,
and tried to drive her back. At the approach of anyone, even a
stranger, she never came off the nest, but just put her head out of the
entrance hole, though only the end of the long curved beak was
visible owing to presence of the porch above the opening, and the
nest only being about three feet high, but she saw all that went on.
By giving two extra days to that of the incubation of the Zosterops,
the egg should have hatched on 9th June. From that date until
the 12th the hen seemed restless and came off the nest more frequently.
On the 12th, before setting off for the day to the Chester Zoo with
Mrs. Belle Benchley, of the San Diego Zoo, who was then my guest,
I felt in the nest and found the egg stuck to the bottom. What caused
this I do not know, whether it was the excess of moisture or the bird
having been " taken short " in the nest, I don't know. However,
I took the egg out and broke it and found a fully-developed young
one inside, but dead.
During the first two weeks of that June (1954) we had the wettest
weather on record during that period for fifty years. The meteoro-
logical authorities said that sometimes an inch of rain fell in a night ;
not being very well up in the mathematics of the M.O. I would not
like to dispute this, but judging by otherwise empty buckets which
seemed to have about half-filled during the night, I should have said
at least 6 inches had fallen ! Whether it was the cold or dampness
that caused the young one to die I don't know.
Of course the hen seemed rather lost when she found her egg gone,
but by the 14th she was lining her nest with clipped downy duck
feathers ; this was unusual as she previously lined it with kapoc.
From the look of the bird it appeared that an egg was laid on the
17th, when I left home for the Avicultural Conference in London.
Arriving back on the Sunday I had rather a shock on seeing the
hen. She looked dejected and utterly exhausted and made no move-
ment when I went to pick her up. In fact she did not move at all for
several hours. Wondering if this was due to her laying another egg,
I felt in the nest and found that there were two eggs there. By late
evening she was back on the nest again and in the morning seemed
quite her usual self.

The hen sat steadily for fifteen days when I knew there must be
something wrong, so I took the eggs out and broke them. One was
clear and the inside was almost dried up, this was possibly due to a
slight puncture of the egg in the early stages. The other contained
a fully formed young one, but dead. The reason for this failure and
the first must have been due to the weather, which was the worst I
have ever known for June and early July. During the whole period
there was not one single hot day. Most days were cold, wet, and
windy, with the temperature ranging between 50* and 6o* F. It was
very sad, for the little hen did her best ; she was a very close sitter
and seldom left the eggs except to feed. Even when she did the cock
followed her about and tried to drive her back on the eggs. During
the period of incubation he took up a stance above the nest, and I
think had there been any other birds in the aviary they would have
fared badly had they dared to come around. The eggs appeared to be
dull brown, darker towards one end, and very much like a warbler's,
though on closer inspection they appear to be very finely speckled
on a lighter ground.
However there is some slight consolation in the fact that I have a
pair of breeding birds, and as Sunbirds are very long lived they may
live to breed another day.
I have also another pair, the male of which is the finest Malachite
I have ever seen, and was the kind gift of my friend Mr. George Bellars,
of Durban. The upper parts of this bird are far more metallic golden
than most other Malachites, and when sprayed with a fine sprayer
becomes a brilliant copper-red all over.
Since the above was written the little hen was lost and lost is
not meant as a euphemism for death. Her disappearance will always
be No. 1 mystery connected with my aviaries. On returning home
from a week-end spent in London I was greeted by the housekeeper,
who delights in being the harbinger of catastrophes. Her first words
on entering the house were : " One of your best birds has gone. On
inquiring which one it was I was told that though she did not know the
name, it was a " lady " bird and not a common hen bird !
Search as I might the hen Malachite was never found. One would
have thought had she escaped from the aviary that she would have
stayed around, for like most Sunbirds she was very tame, and there
were plenty of flowers and insects about ; the weather too was now
warm.
I am sure the male bird cared less about the loss of his wife than I did.
Next year (1955) the very fine male was put out with his wife into
a larger aviary than the other couple had. The hen started almost at
once to build a nest. It was on the same lines as that built by the
other pair, but bulkier. The position in a privet bush evidently did nol
suit the hen, for when it was finished she took it to pieces and rebuild

it in another bush. She did this three times, and by then I was stricken
down with an illness which prevented me from seeing the birds for
almost a year. That year (1955) was really a Sunbird Year if ever
there was one in this land of mists and fogs. We had day after day,
week after week, and month after month of golden summer days.
Had the first little hen JVTalachite been with us I am sure she would
have reared young ones.
However, I am looking forward to the spring of 1956.

(\0x25A0Palceornis derbyana)
By G. M. Payne (Warwick, England)
I have always had a very soft spot for Derbyans, and this desire was
tremendously increased after seeing the beautiful cock bird which
Mr. Benjamin showed at one of the National Shows soon after the
war. I realized, however, that they were rare in captivity, and I
should be extremely lucky if a pair came my way. Since my first
enthusiasm for the species I have kept a vigilant eye open for any
reports.
i * ne can imagine my elation when, through a good friend, I heard
tnat a fancier had a pair for disposal ; a hurried telephone call and a
more hurried journey soon found them in my possession. They were
beautiful, in perfect plumage and condition--in fact absolutely
glowing with health. This was rather surprising as they had been kept
in a cage--a very roomy one, but nevertheless a cage--in a bird room
for some years. With me they were placed in a large parrot cage, the
intention being to turn them out into a new aviary during the spring
9 56 *
As one can imagine, I often passed the cage and gave looks of
approval--at last I had a true pair of Derbyans, a dream and long-held
fancy had become a reality. Then one day I saw the cock regurgitate
some food and feed the hen, and I wondered if this was the first sign
of wanting to nest. As luck would have it, I had just placed some
Gouldian Finches and a pair of Blossom-headed Parrakeets in a large
aviary, and these were quickly removed and redistributed. Then into
this aviary went the Derbyans, after I had put in a grandfather's clock
type nestmg-box. Much anxious watching from a distance took
p ace at this time I feared that their long, close imprisonment might
have cramped the wings, but this was an unfounded fear, the birds
hew straight and surely. Within days the hen was interesting herself
m the nest and my hopes rose.

C. M. PAYNE-BREEDING THE DERBYAN PARRAKEET
The birds were fed on the usual parrakeet mixture with rather
more hemp than I usually allow. They also had green food of
which they ate quantities, and about half an apple each every ot er
day. They were not as fond of soaked oats as the Australian parrakeets,
although some were consumed. , r
After about three weeks of this treatment I went abroad for some
ten days and on my return my aviary attendant told me he had
looked&apos; into the nest and found three eggs--I wondered if he had
looked into the right nest-but it was so, and there were three eggs.
I was naturally delighted, but having kept an extensive collection ol
birds for more years than I care to remember, I was not unaware ot the
many obstacles one has to overcome twixt egg and chick. .
Contrary to the habits of better avicultunsts I often look into my
parrakeet nests, and in fact do so continually throughout the breeding
season. I am of the firm opinion that if one does it more or less con-
tinually, the birds are not disturbed in any way ; so I did look from
time to time to see how matters progressed, and after about ten days
I was convinced there were three fertile eggs. This, of course, is only
one of the obstacles to which I have already referred. .
I ought to have mentioned earlier that mating was witnessed on
many occasions prior to the laying of the eggs. .
The birds are very powerfully built and their beaks look good
enough to demolish an aviary in quick time, so I put into the aviary
substantial boughs of willow which, as most people know, is quite
soft. Although the birds have chewed the boughs considerably, they
have not touched the framework of the aviary and, in fact, are less
destructive than birds many times smaller. They are also extreme y
tolerant of other birds, by necessity (which is another story), and tor
companions they have two pairs of Diamond Sparrows whic ave
also reared young.
I was unable, because of my holiday, to keep an accurate check on
the incubation period. I believe it to be 18 to 20 days, because, after
what appeared to be this period, young were heard in the nest. Young
Derbyans can be heard in the nest without putting an ear to the
entrance hole ; they can be heard six yards away from about the
first day of hatching. . r j u u
The hen kept to the nest for the first ten days, being fed there by
the cock bird. It was noted at the time that the birds were consuming
large quantities of hemp. I simply had to take the risk of feather
plucking, which often accompanies large proportions of hemp m
the diet, and the birds were given hemp ad lib. Fresh green foo m
the way of lettuce, spinach, and groundsel were ever present, an a
few ground nuts were added from time to time. Twice daily t. ey
were also given fresh white bread soaked in milk and squeezed fair y
dry. Of this they ate about a substantial slice each day.

After ten days or so the hen left the nest frequently, when she was
seen to be fed by the cock. During the performance the birds took
up the same stance, and the hen kept up a call which reminded me
distinctly of the caw of the hen Rook when being fed by the male.
Young were hatched and, being so generously fed by their parents,
grew rapidly. At first the young Derbyans were clothed in a white
down. The nest feather is a replica of the adults, but naturally some
shades duller and lighter in tone with the exception of the head,
which is not blue as in the adults, but green. The beaks were red,
not quite as deep or bright as the adult cock. After being out of the
nest about three weeks the beaks turned black. The young cocks will
change again to red during the first moult, the hens remaining black.
The young are now as large as their parents--strong, healthy, and
powerful on the wing and, in fact, they are perfect in every respect.
So ends the private story of a pair of Derbyans and their owner's
elation and misgivings--a further chapter in aviculture.

By L. J. Bettison (Oliver, B.C., Canada)
. As a keen ornithologist and a breeder of many interesting foreign
birds and a member of the Avicultural Society, I thought some
readers might be interested to hear of some of our local wild birds that
frequent this part of British Columbia, the Okanagan Valley of the
Interior. I have a mixed fruit orchard here in the Oliver district_
we are known as the u Dry Belt " and have to grow everything under
rrigation.
In the spring when all the trees are in full blossom, the countryside
s full of bird life, some resident and many migratory coming here to
lest. The small Mourning Doves build in the apple trees and can be
leard any time with their rather mournful cooing, but very soft and
^leasing. The small Lazuli Bunting nests in the bushes, especially the
aspberry patches. The little Goldfinch, which is in full colour of
mellow and black, nests in the fruit trees, especially the peach trees.
Vso, our Siskin has taken to nesting in the orchards--is rather greyer
n colour than the English Siskin. We also have a Purple Finch about
he size of the House Sparrow.
Next, our Red-breasted Robin, or Thrush, nests in the apple trees,
f e Mountain Blue Robin takes advantage of any holes or boxes it
nay find, also its relative the Western Bluebird--not quite so much
)lue in hi s make-up. The Red-shafted Flicker (a Woodpecker) and
he small Spotted Woodpecker will use any hole it may find. The small

Tree Swallow will nest in any vacant nest-box. We also have the Wood
Duck nesting in the river bottom land in hollow trees, such as cotton-
woods, etc. The little Song Sparrows and Chipping Sparrows nest in
the orchards and our Cowbird usually finds their nests to place one of
her eggs in. We have the little Chickadees like the titmice in England.
The Meadow Lark, a big bold bird the size of the Starling, nests in the
grass and the Orioles make their hanging nests from the tops of many
trees. I have one--a cock bird--a pet for two years now and he is
very fond of bread and milk. Last summer I found quite a number
of Waxwing nests in our trees, and how they love our cherries ! The
Black-headed Grosbeak, also nesting here, has a lovely song.
The little California Quail are here in swarms. I have counted as
many as seventeen in one of my aviaries left open for the winter.
The cock quail have a very pretty call, usually given from the top
of a fence post. Our great trouble here is so many of our insectivorous
birds get poisoned from the sprays which we unfortunately have to use.
Two kinds of Humming Birds make their tiny nests and lay two
eggs ; the Rufous and the Calliope, the latter with a violet bib and
the former with a rufous coloured throat.
A bird called the Kingbird--a large black and white flycatcher-
nests in most orchards and will chase any bird, including Crows, from
the vicinity of its nest. It has been known to perch on the shoulders
of a Crow, while in full flight, pecking for all it is worth. Often, when
picking plums, I have known the birds to dart at my face, just missing
me. This will give you some idea of some of our birds in the orchard.
I am hoping, this year, to breed English Greenfinches, Chaffinches,
Siskins, Yellowhammer, Reed Buntings, and Cirl Buntings. I am
trying a pair of Red-headed Buntings from India and I have many
foreign birds, a variety of Doves, Crested and Bronze-wing Australian,
Indian Turtle, local Mourning and Mexican Ground Doves. I have
just got a cock Diamond, but no hen.
By the way, the English Starling is making his appearance here
and I hope he does not get too numerous. He is seen in flocks of our
Red-winged Blackbirds, and Brewer's Blackbirds, which are really a
kind of a Starling. At the coast, in Vancouver, the black and white
Chinese Starling is also increasing.
I have not mentioned our insectivorous birds much, but we have a
large variety and they mostly favour the bottom land along the
Okanagan River. The Long-tailed Chat is our Nightingale and can
often be heard at night. Our mimic is the Catbird, a blackish-coloured
warbler, which is found in nearly every garden and is a great favourite.
One of our (i Nightingales " is a very small frog that lives, in hundreds,
in any swampy place and sings in chorus that takes some getting
used to.

By S. T. Johnstone, Curator (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
The following ducks are recent arrivals at the New Grounds and
may be of interest to readers.
Five specimens of Chinese Spotbill (Anas poecilorhyncha zonorhyncha )
wild-caught, which were sent to us by Mr. Miyake, of Japan, arrived
in May, 1955, together with some wild-caught Falcated Ducks (Anas
falcata) . The Spotbills differ from their more handsome Indian
cousins in that their plumage is basically brown rather than grey,
and the tip of the bill a deep orange. These are the first of their race
to be brought to the New Grounds. They were fairly common in
collections before the war, but they seem to be the only ones in Britain
at present. Although they have been in the collection for several
months they remain quite exceptionally shy and wild.
A welcome addition was a consignment of Ringed Teal (Anas
leucophrys), from Senor Menge, of Buenos Aires. We received two pairs
of these delightful little ducks in October, 1954* Unfortunately they
were in very poor condition on arrival and three subsequently died.
Happily the survivor is a male and this summer (1955) he mated
successfully with one of two females which have been at the New
Grounds for several years. Seven young have been reared, but all
are of the same sex--females ! These Ringed Teal are kept full-
winged in an aviary and spend a great deal of time perching. The
wings make a curious and very characteristic whistle as they fly. The
downy young are like blue-grey Carolina ducklings, with the typically
long tail of the Perching Ducks (Cairinini), and a similar walk, with
complete absence of waddle. These facts, together with a relatively
long incubation period (29 days) support the suggestion offered in the
Key to the Wildfowl of the World (Peter Scott) and originally, I believe,
proposed by Mr. Delacour, that the species should be classified with
the Perching Ducks.
One of the most attractive of the Teal, and the smallest of the Tribe
Anatini, is the Hottentot Teal (Anas punctata). For more than a year
we have kept a trio of these birds in the aviary. They are the African
version of the South American Versicolor and Puna Teals, but smaller
and with a dark triangular patch on the cheeks. This trio was caught
and sent to us by Mr. Christopher Savage. Mr. Savage has returned
to Africa, and through the good offices of Dr. John Thoburn William-
son, of Williamson Diamonds, Ltd., Shinyanga, he has been able to
send us a number of ducks including two more pairs of Hottentots,
which are now well-established. The species was bred at Walcot Hall
mmediately before the last war, so there seems no reason why they

should not breed again, and it would be delightful to re-establish these
decorative little birds in British collections.
In June we received from Phra Abhaivongc, of Siam, ten White-
winged Wood Ducks (Cairina scutulata). These enormous ducks were
very wild and refused food for several days. They were quarantined
close to our live eel tank and when catching the fish to feed our saw-
bills, we tossed a few pieces to the Wood Ducks who consumed them
greedily. After a fortnight of eating large quantities, they lost interest
in the eels and now feed on the usual diet of poultry biscuit and
grain. They have lost their travel-stained feathers and have emerged
in immaculate plumage. The females are smaller than the males.
Their heads are less white and their bills are not so bright an orange
as the males. They make an attractive addition to our collection and
have become very tame, though in the summer they were in sad
disgrace. A brood of South American Comb Duck disappeared
suddenly and theory attributed their disappearance to the White-
winged Wood Ducks' cannabilistic tendencies, especially as one had
previously been seen trying to swallow a Mallard duckling.
A fine pair of King Eider Ducks (Somateria spectabilis) are now in the
collection and were acquired in intriguing circumstances. The male,
in full plumage, was washed aboard a fishing trawler in Icelandic
waters. The Master, on arrival at Reyjkavik, took the duck to
Dr. Finnur Gudmundsson, of Reyjkavik, who was at first delighted
with the prospect of so fine a skin for his museum. But then he
remembered our desire to have this species represented at the New
Grounds, and promptly dispatched him to us. He had been fed on
shrimps before being sent, and after force-feeding for two days on live
eels he was quite prepared to help himself. A happy sequel to this
story is that during a visit by our Director, Peter Scott, to the Copen-
hagen Zoo, Dr. Boje Benzon, hearing of our drake, offered us a fine
female, which arrived a few weeks later. The two paired up, but the
season was obviously too far advanced for any hope of nesting.
Persuading Eiders to moult properly is one of the more difficult
avicultural problems, and in this respect males seem to be more
difficult than females. The King Eider drake was late going into
eclipse plumage, but he got there in September. Correspondingly he
has been slow coming back into plumage, but by Christmas he was
almost in full plumage again, and the full plumage drake King Eider
is one of the finest of all waterfowl. The duck has come into a plumage
which is rich chestnut brown, far brighter than that of any female
common European Eider, and she shows the two thornlike feathers on
her back, though somewhat blunter than in the male.
Of the five pairs of European Eiders kept at the New Grounds only
two breed regularly, so we should not perhaps be too optimistic about
breeding the King Eiders.

(Gymnoris dentata )
By C. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
Like most species of foreign sparrows the Lesser Rock Sparrow is
not regularly imported, and when imported there does not seem
to be any great demand for the species. Like most other sparrows,
especially those in a sombre dress, they are not very popular with the
fanciers and obviously hard to sell.
Some six years ago, when visiting the Odense Zoo in Denmark,
I saw in a newly arrived consignment of African birds a sparrow
which I had not seen before. My colleague, the late director,
Chr. Jensen, gave it to me, but later in the year it was killed by a
Swainson's Sparrow. In 1952 I found five specimens at a dealer's in
Copenhagen which I obtained. The species of the birds was not known
and when examining them at home they turned out to be the Lesser
Rock Sparrow (Gymnoris dentata). Being very busy during 1953 I had
no time for making any breeding experiments and kept them in
a flight with various weavers.
The birds were not difficult to sex. When I obtained them in 1952
they were all quite similar, obviously young birds. In the mean-
time I had not made any closer observations, but in 1954 I decided to
try to breed them and sexed them out. They turned out to be two
cocks and three hens. The colour of the cock is mainly grey and the
eyebrow of more pronounced chestnut colour than that of the hen.
The hen's colour is distinctly more brown than that of the cock. One
pair was separated in a small indoor flight &lt;2,\ by 6 feet and 7 feet high.
A. nest, mainly of coconut fibres, was built in a Budgerigar nest-box
out no eggs were laid during the whole summer.
In r 955 I erected a new indoor flight, 22 by 10 feet and 6 feet high,
A^ith three large windows facing south and a smaller one facing east ;
:his was rather sparingly equipped with branches, leaving much flying
space. Numerous nests of different models : Harzer wicker cages,
lalf-open boxes, Budgerigar nest-boxes, and Keston triangular nest-
ooxes were hung on the walls at different heights from the floor to the
oof. The room was separated from two adjoining flights by J in.
nesh netting. Two shelves for feeding receptacles were placed on
)oth sides of the entrance door, and a big zinc tray for a shallow bath
md an automatic drinker on the floor. The soft food was not given
n pots, but scattered over the sand in a big shallow zinc box on the
loor. It is my experience that birds more readily take to food when
hey can pick it up from the ground than if it is offered in pots. The

sand in the box was changed every day and untouched food removed
at the same time. ,
In this flight I released a pair of the Rock Sparrows. The birds
were marked with coloured celluloid rings, and I had noted which
birds kept together. As well as the sparrows, pairs of different small
weaver finches such as Grey, Orange-cheeked, and Golden-breasted
Waxbills, Avadavats, Cordon-bleus, Parson, and Masked Grass-
finches, Bichenow's, Diamond Sparrows, Red-headed Parrot Finches
and Cuban Finches occupied the room. All the birds were released
in March.
At the end of March I observed that the hen Rock Sparrow came
out from a Keston triangular box hung on the wall at about 5 feet
between the windows, the opening facing the inside of the room.
On examining the box I saw that the nest was built exclusively of
small feathers which had blown into the room through the netting
from an adjoining flight for young Budgerigars. Different kinds
of building material were, of course, at the birds' disposal but neither
hay, coconut fibres, white dog hair, or very thin birch twigs had been
used. There were two eggs only in the nest ; typical sparrow eggs in
colour and about the size of canary eggs. When examining the nest
some days later, on 1st April, two newly hatched youngsters were
seen ; these left the nest on 19th and 22nd April. The youngsters
were ? a bit smaller than their parents and of the same colour as the
female. As I saw them just after leaving the nest it was an easy task
to catch them up and ring them with different coloured rings. The
following day they flew almost as well as the old birds.
I now examined the nest every day, and the day after the last
youngster had left the nest, on the 23rd April, a new egg was laid,
followed on the 24th and 25th by two more. Only one youngster was
hatched on 7th May ; the two remaining eggs had disappeared on
the 1 ith. The youngster left the nest on 27th May and on the same day
an egg was laid, followed the next day by a second. These eggs were
probably clear and disappeared on the 14th June. Three eggs were
laid again on 18th, 19th, and 20th June respectively. On 1st July
two youngsters were hatched and on 3 r d July the last egg hatched.
All the youngsters were reared and left the nest on 23rd, 24th, and
25th July. At this time some other bird had removed all the feathers
from the nest so that the three youngsters were sitting on the wood of
the box, not very comfortable when the form of the triangular box
is considered. _ jT
In all four clutches of eggs had been laid, three of which had
hatched and been successfully reared. No further nesting attempts
were made after the fourth clutch.
The youngsters are all thriving well. As far as I can see they all
still have the colour of their mother, but I have not tried to catch them

Lip for closer examination as other birds are still sitting and rearing
in the room.
I do not know if it is a special or individual character of this pair,
but the birds have all the time been as peaceful as a pair of Bengalese
:&gt;r Parrot Finches. I never saw them chase or attack any other birds,
not even a pair of Fringillaria tahapisi , their nearest relatives in the
[light. Even when sitting on a new clutch the older youngsters were
never chased. The birds were not shy, the hen never left the nest
till I was close in front of the nest opening. Ten minutes after the
nest had been hung in place and I had left the flight she was sitting
again.
As to rearing food, egg-food, fresh ants' eggs, sprouted millet,
:anary seed, oats, and sunflower seeds were offered, and later in the
season chickweed too, but very sparingly, as it was hard to obtain in
:his exceptionally dry summer. As mentioned earlier, the rearing
bod was scattered on the sand in a large shallow box. As far as I could
see fresh ants' eggs were first taken when fresh food was offered. I
suppose, however, that other kinds of food were also used as the rearing
bod was only offered once a day.
I have always fresh ants' eggs at hand, outside the season frozen,
[t is my impression that many birds start to feed more easily when
hey have fresh ants' eggs at their disposal than with any other food.
When the youngsters in this way are not starved from the start they
,vill be able to beg for more food more energetically, which stimulates
:he parents to take other rearing foods too, which they probably
vould not use if the feeding instinct (or reflex) had not first been
&apos;eleased by that, from the bird's point of view, obviously very desirable
ood, the fresh ants' eggs.
According to Dr. Russ this species was first bred by the Prince
Ferdinand of Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha (later Czar of Bulgaria) in
Vdenna in 1873, when one young was reared (Teste : Russ, Die
r remdldndischen Stubenvogel , i, page 685). The late Czar was one of the
bremost aviculturists of his time.
A further breeding success was obtained by Mr. P. W. Louwman at
^ijswijk in Holland in 1933 i n a large aviary. Three youngsters
vere hatched, one was thrown out and two left the nest on 12th June
and lived to maturity. Mr. Louwman is now owner of the Wassenaar
#oo, and the bird-house, the famous Louise Hall, probably the most
beautiful bird-house in any zoo, is no doubt well known to many
nembers of the Society.
As a summary : It seems that the eggs are laid on successive days
and that sitting starts when the first or second egg is laid ; incubation
:ime thirteen days. The young leave the nest when about 22-23 days
dd. As far as I could detect they were fed (by the male) for about a
ortnight after leaving the nest.

(i Continued, from p. 33)
Voice
In the Speckled Pigeon, the European species of Columba and mos
(probably all) of the Streptopelia species the vocalizations of adult bird:
can be divided into three or four " basic calls ". These four basi&lt;
utterances are subject to some variation but not sufficient to render th.
concept invalid. They seem best termed the "Advertising-coo"
the " Display-coo ", the " Distress-call ", and the " Excitement-cry 5
Many American writers (Levi, 1940, Whitman, 1919, etc.) have usee
the term " crow " for the display-coo. I consider this term unsuitabl
as it wrongly suggests that this note is equivalent to the crowing c
a cock ( Gallus ). .
The advertising-coo--the " coo " of some American, and th
" song " of many British writers on pigeons--is used in a wide variet
of situations whose common factor is that the bird is prevented fror
performing some (usually reproductive) activity by some cause whic
does not arouse overt fear or aggressiveness. Usually it is through lac
of an appropriately responding partner. In Columba it seems confine
to birds in some phase of the reproductive cycle, but this is n(
invariably the case in Streptopelia. The nest-call (Goodwin, 1955)

The dhplay-coo accompanies the bowing-display (q.v.). It ten
to be polysyllabic and indistinct in Columba. In no instance is
louder than the full intensity version of the advertising-coo. In tl

indecision. Adults usually give it when they see their young handled.
On cold winter mornings my Barbary and Red-eyed Doves often
utter it whilst still on their roosting places. Here it seems to be an
expression of discomfort or perhaps of annoyance caused by a conflict
between the impulse to fly down and feed and reluctance to leave the
perch. Whitman records pigeons (species not stated) giving this
note when they saw others copulating. Probably this refers to birds
that would have interfered with the act had they been free to do so.
Some species give it immediately after copulation.
In the above two instances it seems equivalent to the excitement-cry
of Streptopelia. When used after mating it seems more likely to be an
expression of aggressive impulses than an expression of pleasure as
Whitman suggests.
The excitement-cry is an emphatic " non-cooing " call. It may
intergrade with the distress-call, but in typical form is usually distinct
from it. It is given as an expression of either aggressive or sexual
excitement, but seems linked rather with the intensity than the
specifity of the emotion felt. An excitement-cry is common to all the
ring-necked doves whose voices have been described (Newman, 1908
and 1909, Goodwin, 1952 ; Hoffstetter, 1952 and 1954) and by the
Turtle Dove. There can be little doubt that all their near allies
(e.g. S. lugens , S. reichenowi , et al.) agree with them in this* The
Laughing Dove and the Spotted Dove appear, however, to have no
sxcitement-cry. At least they do not normally utter it in the same
situations as the other species do. This fact, together with some of
&apos;their plumage characters, suggests that these two species stand in
closer relationship with each other than either does to any other
species.
Generally speaking female pigeons coo less loudly and less often
than males, and they do not normally use the full intensity sexual
orm of the display-coo. They use the excitement-cry and distress-call
is freely as males. Unpaired females in reproductive condition will
}ften use the advertisement-coo as freely as a male.
Young pigeons possess, apart from the puffing and bill-snapping
used in the defensive-threat display (q.v.), only a sibilant squeaking
Tote. This is used as an expression of any apparent excitement, and
:hus approaches in significance and causation the excitement-cry of
:he Streptopelia species. One has the impression, however, that as
;oon as the young bird is capable of feeling the same (apparent)
pecific emotional moods as the adult it will " try " to make the adult
lotes. In the Speckled Pigeon, C. livia, and the Barbary Dove, probably
ilso in other species, this may occur as soon as, or even a little before,
he bird is able to fly. At first it can only squeak in the same rhythm
is the adult's coos and its voice only gradually " breaks ". Even
liter it has begun to coo and cry in the adult manner (though not as

yet with the proper adult sound and intonation) the young pigeon
will still use the infantile squeaking when begging. As is the case
with young grebes, young pigeons use identical cries and wing move-
ments when begging an adult for food as when it attacks them. T e
only difference is that when begging for food the young one reaches
up eagerly, trying to insert its bill into the adult s mouth, and when
" begging 'for mercy " it turns away from the adult, fleeing or
cowering.
C. livia
The advertising-coo is the well-known moaning Odrh or
" Oh-66-6or " subject to some variation. It is given when nest-
calling, when ready to feed well-grown young and as a song from
some perch in or near the nesting territory. Tame specimens, when
breeding, but not otherwise, will coo in this manner when waiting for
their owner to feed them. .
The display-coo is the rather hurried " Oo-roo-k'too-coo (Hem-
roth's " Wang-wang-ruckuh "). In the intense sexual form of the
bowing-display (q.v.) this phrase becomes blurred and its final
syllable emphasized and longer drawn. This is probably due to
elements of the advertising coo--and its correlated subjective mood
--being mixed with or superimposed on the otherwise self-assertive
mood and vocal expression.
The distress-call is as described under the general heading. Long-
drawn, loud, panting forms of it are given by timid domestic or
captive birds defending their nests against an intruding hand. . It
seems then to be an expression of fear, due to thwarted escaping
impulses, rather than of anger, since tamer specimens attack in silence
or give the display-coo. Intermediate forms between the distress call
and the advertising-coo are used by the female towards her mate
in appeasing contexts and more rarely vice versa.
There appears to be no true excitement-cry but a low fretful
murmuring sound, only audible at very close quarters, is often uttered,
usually when the bird appears somewhat perturbed or angry. This
may perhaps be a vestigial form of such a cry.
The Speckled Pigeon
In voice, as well as in display and some morphological characters
(Goodwin, 1956), this species seems to stand much closer to C. lime
than do the Stock-Dove or Wood-Pigeon. The advertising-coo, ir
its high intensity form, is unmistakable but difficult to transliterate
It could perhaps be written " Woorh woorh wo6-w66-w6o-w66-w66
or " Oorh-odrh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ", the opening notes usually
faint, slow and muffled and the succeeding ones increasing in loudness
speed, and emphasis. Although this sounds at first very differen

from the advertising-coo of C. livia I have the impression that it is in
fact nothing but the latter's " Oorh " calls, speeded up and run
together. When, apparently, less intensely impelled to call, the
Speckled Pigeon will utter the " Oorh-oorh " notes more slowly and
they are then hardly distinguishable from the homologous utterances
of C. livia. The Speckled Pigeon gives this call under the same circum-
stances as C. livia, but (so far as one can judge from a limited number
of captive birds) rather less readily. I have only seen it given on the
nest-site on a few occasions and these were all rather low-intensity
variants that a female gave when her mate came with nesting material
for her. This may reflect incomplete observations due to the relative
wildness of my specimens rather than actual specific differences
between this species and C. livia.
The display-coo is a deep, emphatic " Ooroo-coo ! " or " Oor -60
coo-66 ! " commonly repeated twice or more in succession and
subject to some variation of tone and emphasis. Often a soft, short
" 66 " is audible before the main phrase " 66-Oor66-c66 ! " My
only male of the southern form C. guinea phaenota gave a more
lengthened version when displaying intensely " 06r66-c66-66-66o ! "
I do not know if this difference was of any racial significance. A
Stock Dove-like snapping of the mandibles may punctuate the display
phrase, but the majority of birds do not do this audibly, if at all.
The display-coo of the Speckled Pigeon is always self-assertive and
often definitely threatening in meaning though its utterance shows
that the bird is, at least at the moment of giving voice, inhibited from
attacking.
As with the advertising-coo, the display-coo of the Speckled Pigeon
strikes one very forcibly with its similarity to that of C. livia, although
in this case the notes are delivered much more slowly and deliberately
instead of in quicker time. As with C. livia the last syllable(s) of the
display-coo tend to be more lengthened and emphasized in sexual
than in purely threatening contexts.
The distress-call is like that of C. livia, but perhaps tends to be a
little louder on the whole. It is given under all the circumstances
that elicit it in C. livia, but also seems sometimes to be used as an
expression of any intense emotion. Thus it is given immediately after
copulation and also (sometimes) when attacking other birds.
The Stock-Dove
The advertising-coo a rather hurried-sounding but (to my ears)
musical " 06 - 66-66 ! " or " Co6-66-r66 ! " subject to some variation.
It is given in the same form when used--as it habitually is--as a
nest-call.
The display-coo is a very soft, faint, droning " Ooh-6oh " or
' Coo-66, co6-66h " punctuated in the middle by a soft snapping of

the mandibles. It is only audible within a few yards, hence the
frequent statement in bird books that the Stock-Dove is silent when
displaying.
The distress-call is like that of C. livid, but perhaps rather higher
pitched, and given in the same situations.
The Wood-Pigeon
The advertising-coo is the well-known musical cooing " song "
which adds so much to the enjoyment alike of our loneliest woods
and our dirtiest and most depressing London gardens. It could
perhaps best be rendered " 06 - 66 - 66 - 56 - 66 , 66 - 66 - 66 - 65 - 65 , 65 ! "
each phrase is usually repeated from two to five times and ends on
an abrupt " 66 ! " To most of us, however, the advertising-coo of the
Wood-Pigeon will ever suggest " Tak too coos, Taffy, tak ! ", " My
toe bleeds, Betty, Oh ! " or some other firmly " imprinted " trans-
literation of our childhood ! It has been pointed out (Huxley and
Brown, 1954) that the phrase usually begins on the second note, the
" too " of the " tak too coos ..." wording. This appears to be the
case when one is at a little distance but on five occasions when I have
been within a few feet of a Wood-Pigeon (a different bird each time)
as it cooed, it began with the " tak " but this so faint as only to be
audible at close quarters. The Wood-Pigeon's nest-call is a rather
low-pitched " 06 , ooorh ! " subject to variation and sometimes
sounding strained and anguished though not typically so. Despite
its apparent difference from the advertising-coo it seems in fact to be
merely the opening "Tak too " of the song phrase rendered slowly
and softly.
The apparently more highly developed phrase of the Wood-
Pigeon's advertising-coo, together with a distinct and much simpler
variant used only as a nest-call is perhaps due to its being originally
a forest bird. This may have favoured the development of a loud,
distinctive " song " with a definitely threatening context in reference
to unseen trespassers, which in turn necessitated a recognizably
different form being used when the function was to attract and not
repel another bird. This is mere speculation. It is certain, however,
that a male Wood-Pigeon alone on his nest-site seldom gives the nest-
call. He stands in normal posture and utters the usual advertising-coo.
When his mate, or a prospective mate, comes in sight and shows signs
of interest he lowers himself and begins to utter the nest-call and to
nod invitingly.
The distress call of the Wood-Pigeon is much like that of C. livid .
It is apparently given after copulation (Witherby, et al., 1939, Whitman,
1919), as with the Speckled Pigeon. I have not been near enough to
copulating pairs of this species to hear whether or not some fairly
quiet call was given.

Barbary Dove
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996916897435898" page_id="58072953"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
The advertising-coo is the familiar " Coo, C'rroo ", " Coo, c'rroo-
56 ! " or " Coo-c'rroo-a ! " I am not able to distinguish it with
:ertainty the display-coo, which is perhaps, typically, a little less
ong-drawn and " pleading " in tone than at least the nest-calling
/ersions of the advertising-coo. With experience one can usually
^uess the mood of the bird and its circumstances from the subtle tones
md emphasis of its cooing, but I fear any attempt to describe such
ninutiae in words would be useless, if not actually misleading.
The cooing is used under the same circumstances as in C. livia ,
Dut also seems to function (as it may in the Wood-Pigeon) as a contact
lote when the pair have become separated. Specimens released from
,aptivity for the first time in their lives usually coo (as a rule only
&gt;nce and rather softly) on alighting after their first flight. They may
lo this even if they are not in reproductive condition.
The distress-call is like that of C. livia , but rather higher-pitched
md (usually) longer drawn-out. It often suggests a single note of
he excitement-cry but charged with feelings of despair, sorrow, or
ear instead of aggressive self-assertion.
The excitement cry is the rather high-pitched laughing " he-he-
ie ! I had one male Barbary (which I most foolishly liberated and
ost before I had bred him) whose excitement-cry was a single, long-
Irawn almost screaming " Heeeee ! " sounding much like the excite-
nent-cry of S. d. decaocto. In all other respects this bird was typical
&gt;f the domestic form. The excitement-cry is uttered by both sexes
mmediately after copulation, as well as in other moments of sexual
nd aggressive excitement (see Goodwin, 1952, for fuller details).
Barbaries often utter a very faint, rather plaintive, murmuring
ound. This is done without any special posturing. Indeed, when
first heard these notes--which are only audible when the bird is
/ithin a few feet of one I thought the bird giving them was suffering
*m respiratory illness. These notes may sometimes have an appeasing
motion, but I think they usually indicate only a very low level of
ny form of emotional excitement. Sometimes indeed they may
evelop into the excitement-cry. I have heard similar murmuring
Dunds from the Red-eyed Dove and C. livia. Probably they are made
y all species.
In the wild palearctic form of the Collared Dove (S. d. decaocto ),
dc display-coo, advertising-coo, and the nest-call are distinct

Red-eyed Dove
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99042611627907" page_id="58072954"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
The advertising-coo is a spirited, cheerful-sounding " Coo-coo
c 66 -c 56 -co 6 , coo-coo " or " Coo-coo, coo-cod, coo-coo, coo-coo ! '
usually repeated twice or more. The same form of it is used as a
nest-call. The display-coo is hurried and muffled and suggests a
muted and much speeded-up version of the advertising-coo. The
excitement-cry is a sharp, rather high-pitched note that could almost
be described as a short scream. It is suggestive in its emphasis and
suddenness of the " spitting " of a defensive domestic cat. To my ears
this cry always sounds mono-syllabic, but Newman described it as
" a whistled ' Wee-ha 5 ". Unlike the Barbary, with which it other-
wise agrees in the circumstances under which it utters its various
calls, the Red-eye Dove often utters its excitement-cry when handled
Here it seems to express extreme fear and is given particularly if th(
bird is struggling to escape. Except that it is perhaps sometimes
more drawn-out I am unable to detect any difference in the excitement-
cry given by a frightened bird in the hand and that given wher
angry, or after copulation. The usual distress call is similar to tha
of the Barbary.
Turtle-Dove
The advertising-coo is the c&lt; Coorr-coorr or Turr-turr fron
which the bird's name derives. A variant of this Co6rr-co6rr-c66rr
is used as a nest-call. It is, however, also given from situations sue!
as high up in bare or thinly foliaged trees--where the species neve
nests. Possibly this occurs in response to the presence of a femal
which the previously advertisement-cooing male wishes to attrac
rather than repel. I have not seen a Turtle-Dove give the nest-ca,
when actually on its song-post (usually a bare, high bough overlookin
the nesting area) and suspect that when giving it the bird is alway
in a situation that to some extent suggests to it a potential nest-sit(
Unfortunately I did not pay enough detailed attention to the hand
reared Turtle-Doves that I kept and bred in my youth, and under th
present bird-protection laws it is not permissible to take any youn
ones for hand-rearing and close study. The display-coo is a hurrie
croor(wa) croor(wa) croor(wa) in time with the rapid bobbing movt
ments used in the bowing-display (q.v.).
The excitement-cry is a short percussive note suggestive of th
sudden withdrawal of a cork from a bottle. It appears to be slight!
less freely used, or rather that a slightly higher pitch of excitement
necessary to elicit it, than the homologous cries of the ring-necke
doves. The distress call is similar to that of the Barbary, but perha}
higher pitched.

The Spotted Dove (Ceylon race )
The advertising-coo is an emphatic " Coo, croo-oo, cro6-66 ! 55
)r " Coocoo, croor-croor ! " subject to much minor variation. It has
i rising cadence and an excited " cheering " tone unlike that of any
Dther dove known to me, although except for this quality of excitement
n their sound the " croor " notes are rather like those of the Turtle-
Dove. I have heard my male bird give all his usual variants of this
phrase both from his perch and when nest-calling. The female utters
piiet and indistinct, but nevertheless rather hoarse and unmusical,
versions very freely. This she often does whilst incubating if the
tiale begins to coo. Such cooing from the nest, like the nocturnal
:ooing in which most doves indulge seems potentially dangerous,
^erhaps few natural enemies of doves use their ears when seeking prey.
The display-coo is merely a slightly simplified form of the above
Coo, croor ! " or " Coo, cro6-6or ! " given while bowing (q.v.)
ind repeated at each further bow.
The distress-call is rather loud for so small a bird, and perhaps
lIso rather longer-drawn out than in other species mentioned, but the
lifFerence is slight. There appears to be no excitement-cry.
Philogeny
It seems not out of place to make some remarks as to the probable
elationships of the species that have been discussed. The Columba
pecies are, without much doubt, more closely related to each other
han any one of them is to any of the Streptopelia species. The suggestion
Bodenstein, 1949) that the ring-necked doves are more closely
elated to C. livia than is the Wood-Pigeon seems to me untenable.
That in some points of structure the latter may be less like C. livia
s true, but these differences are all due to adaptations to tree or
round feeding respectively and are not likely to have important
(hilogenetic significance. In its displays, as in its plumage, the
\0x25BAtock-Dove shares some characters with C. livia and others with the
Vood-Pigeon. I think, however, that it is probably more closely
elated to the former, its striking superficial resemblance to the Rock-
'igeon could well be, at least in part, due to convergent adaptations
0 ground feeding, hole nesting, and a relatively open habitat.
The Speckled and Rock-Pigeons, although clearly distinct species,
eem to be more closely related to each other than either is to the
&apos;tock-Dove or Wood-Pigeon. I have elsewhere (Goodwin, 1956)
iscussed their taxonomic characters and the reasons for supposing
heir similarities to be due to close relationship rather than to con-
ergent adaptations to a similar way of life. I have the impression
llat of the two the Speckled Pigeon stands nearer to the Stock-Dove
nd Wood-Pigeon, in spite of its greater colour difference, than does
&apos;* livia.

Of the Streptopelia species the Barbary and Collared-Doves are
almost certainly conspecific. They are clearly more closely related
to the Red-eyed Dove (and probably to all other ring-necked doves
with the possible exception of the Red Dove (S. tranquebarica) than tc
the Turtle-Dove. I think this latter is, however, probably nearer tc
the ring-necked Streptopelia species than it is to the Laughing and
Spotted Doves, in spite of its superficial colour resemblance to the
latter species. As has already been mentioned (see section on voice]
the Laughing and Spotted Doves appear closely related to each othei
and to stand a little apart from the other Streptopelias.
The above remarks only take into account the species dealt witl
in this paper. If one knew sufficient to deal with all species of pigeon;
a very different picture might emerge. The Wood-Pigeon seem
nearer akin to several Asiatic species than it is to the Stock-Dove
whilst the latter's nearest relatives are Eversmann's Stock-Dove
Columba eversmanni, and the Somaliland Pigeon, C. olivae.

By Gust. A. Gjessing (Drammen, Norway)
After unsuccessful attempts in 1953 and 1954 to breed the Red
Cardinal, I have finally found the way to do it and the result was
hree nests in 1955 with : first nest, 3 eggs--two young matured ;
econd nest, 3 eggs--two young matured ; third nest, 3 eggs--two
mung still in the nest as this is written. During two unsuccessful
;easons the Red Cadinals built nests and hatched young, but the
/oung died in the nest. I wrote to Mr. Allen Silver for advice. He
eplied : "Do not be discouraged because you have not had any
uck with the Red Cardinal, I have in my time never heard of anybody
lere who succeeded."
This should mean that the breeding of this bird is quite uncommon.
- acquired a pair in 1953 from a member in Denmark, Mr. Walther
.angberg, and that summer they built a nest in an old canary
vire nest placed in a spruce planted in the aviary. They were at that
ime with about fifty different finches in an aviary 4 metres by
[ metres outside flight. But the young died after about a week.
Next year they nested in the same nest and under the same con-
litions, and exactly the same happened. I also had a pair of Pope
Cardinals in the same aviary and these also hatched young that died
ifter about ten days.
I had some correspondence with a German breeder who claimed to
lave raised several nests of Red Cardinals on egg-food alone,
iaving read Mr. Brooksbank's notes on this bird in his book, I was
laturally very sceptical as to the correctness of the statement of this
ferman breeder, but decided to try his method this year. I placed
he Red Cardinals in a smaller aviary (2*5 yds. by 2-5 yds.) with
i/2 Violets and 1/1 White-winged Budgerigars. In a corner I set
ip a pine bush and in this bush I placed the old wire nest that they had
referred before.
I filled the nest half full with cocos-nesting materials and threw
ome more on the ground. By Christmas I had started to feed them
egularly with egg-food, made in the usual way, one egg and some
rumbled stale white bread, and added half a teaspoon of strawberry
am each day. At first they did not touch the egg-food, but as time
vent on and they had it served every day, they started to eat it.
&gt;oon after I turned them out in the aviary they finished the nest
nd the hen laid three eggs, which hatched out, but one young
disappeared the first day. I have a strong suspicion that the cock
imply considers the possibility of his being able to rear as many
oung as are in the nest, and if he thinks there are too many he simply
ats those he wants to get rid of. They have disappeared so absolutely
hat this is the only thing I can think of ; I have read in Cage

GUST. A. GJESSING-BREEDING OF THE RED CARDINAL
Birds that Thrushes do this, why not then Cardinals ? Anyway, the
two young were raised on the egg-food, and fourteen days after birth
they flew out--very small and very helpless, and in colour all brown.
After a week they started to grow and one got a quite bold " top "
on his head and showed at first white on the belly, which later turned
a vague rose. It was quite easy to see that this was a male. By now
they are seven weeks out of the nest and the whole crown of his head,
under the wings, and shoulders are red and there is a suffusion of
rose on his chest. His tail and large wing-feathers are red with black.
The other is certainly a hen. She has the blackish-red feathers in the
tail and wings, but is brown otherwise. While the young were being
taught to eat, the hen laid and hatched her second brood. There were
again two young, and the procedure of leaving the nest was the same
as already described.
I noticed that as soon as the second brood left the nest the cock
started to pick on the first two young ; he chased them around so
I had to move them out of the aviary. I had not then seen them
feed alone, so I put them for a few days in a cage to see if they really
could get along without help. They could ; they ate egg-food and
small seed. Then I gave them a few mealworms, they looked very
sceptical at these at first, but soon learned to take them and to like
them.
I also got some fresh ant cocoons for them which they very much
liked, as I am of the opinion that some live food is necessary for the
cock, at least while he is getting into his red costume, to get the colour
better. I am very anxious to see him in complete colour, to find
out if the bright red of the new imports comes on birds born here.
By the way, I must mention that my Red Cardinals have regained the
original bright red colour after every moult since I got them in 1953
in the early spring. Some writers seem to be of the opinion that they
always turn a brick-red colour when moulting in confinement. This
is not so.
The second brood of young are now being taught to eat ; they
look like two hens, and the old hen is having a third brood, the young
now being four days old.
Another thing I noticed which might be of interest was that aftei
the young had been out of the nest a week the cock started to feed
them with jam, also regular Budgie seed mixture, in addition tc
the egg-food ; probably to get them used to this type of food.
The first young are now in an aviary with four Cockatiels and one
cock Golden Pheasant, which get along nicely. In the aviary where
I keep about 100 Budgies, I had placed the pair of Pope Cardinals
and they made a nest in the same tree that had been used the previou:
two years by the Red Cardinals ; they reared three fine young
one of which died two weeks after leaving the nest; the other tw(

iave long been on their own. They acted almost exactly like the
led Cardinals and took the same food ; in addition, I made up a
; fly-trap " by filling an old cage with raw fish and placing it in
he sun inside the aviary. Soon flies began to flock around this and
he Cardinals caught them very nicely and fed them to their young,

noticed the following on these birds : As soon as the first brood
f young were out of the nest and she (the old female) had a new
lutch of eggs, she taught one of the young to sit on the eggs to keep
hem warm while she helped the cock to find food for the two large
oung that were quite demanding. It was very amusing to watch
er teach the little fellow to lie still and wait till she came with food
)r him. He soon was just as conscientious as his mother in seeing
le eggs did not chill. By the way, the Red Cardinal is very fond of
11 kinds of fresh berries while rearing young. The Pope Cardinal,
owever, does not seem to take berries.

An increased number of classes, bringing the total to 46, were
[located to Foreign Birds at the National Show this year. This is
le most liberal classification ever to be granted to the foreign section,
ad attracted a record entry of 700 exhibits. As might be expected,
le largest classes were those for the common species of seed-eaters,
le common Waxbill class having an entry of 33, but probably the
tost remarkable entry was that of 27 in the Sunbird class.
Almost without exception the exhibits were staged in excellent
mdition, and it was particularly pleasing to note the obvious care
hich had been taken by exhibitors to provide suitable cages of
iequate dimensions. Many of the cages containing the smaller
&gt;ftbills were most tastefully decorated, and there is no doubt that the
tistic presentation of the birds in this manner must help considerably
&gt; counter the adverse criticism of bird-keeping which is too frequently
tade by members of the public who visit the Show.
An outstanding Violet-eared Waxbill, belonging to Mr. H. Mitchell,
as awarded the Rosette for best seed-eater, and the Special for best
Ttbill went to Mr Sawyer's magnificent King Bird of Paradise,
hich subsequently won the National Award of Merit for best Foreign
Td and the Supreme Championship of the Show against a total
itry of over 10,000. It is many years since this species has appeared
1 ^ le show bench, and Mr. Sawyer is to be congratulated on staging
ch an outstanding exhibit in absolutely faultless condition.

The same exhibitor won the Duke of Bedford Trophy, for the second
year in succession, with his very beautiful Racquet-tailed Parrot.,
a species which I have not known to be exhibited before, and also the
Maxwell Shield for the most artistically decorated cage.
Amongst the small seed-eaters were several pairs of St. Helens
Waxbills, of at least three different races, and in the Muma Glass wen
a good pair of Magpie Mannikins, two or three pairs of Rufous-backed
Bronze-winged, and Spotted Munias, and also Tri-coloured, White
headed, and the less common Java Maja.
The Bunting class was won by a good pair of Golden-breasted
followed by Lazuli and Rainbows, and an interesting, if less spectacula
exhibit, the African Rock Bunting.
A good class of Weavers included excellent examples ol th
Madagascar, Chestnut, Thick-billed, and Mahali in addition to th
more common species, and among the Whydahs were severa
Jackson's, together with Queen, Giant, and the attractive Ye ow
shouldered. ...
In the class for Gouldian, and Parrot Finches, the winning pair c
Pintailed Nonpareils were claimed at the catalogue price of #12 ioj
These were followed by one of the best pairs of Red-headed Parrc
Finches I have seen, and there were several very good Red-heade
and Black-headed Gouldians. Other Australian Grassfinches repn
sented were Cherry, Star, Hecks, Bicheno, Crimson, Painted, an
Chestnut-breasted Finches and Diamond Sparrows.
The class for Rare Waxbills included quite a number of Viole
eared, Black-cheeked, Dufresne's, Sydney, and Melbas, and in th
A.O.S. Small Seedeaters, Aurora Finches, and Pileated were showi
Also in this class were two unusual exhibits, a pair of Black-face
Canaries and a Madeira Goldfinch, C. carduelis parvus. The latfc
differed so little from the familiar British species as really to look 01
of place in a class for foreign birds.
Seventeen entries in the Cardinal and Grosbeak class included
number of Chinese Grosbeaks, particularly noticeable on account
their unusual white flight feathers, a pair each of Evening Grosbea
and Pigmy Cardinals, a cock Virginian Cardinal shown in excelle.
condition and in the full glory of its natural brilliant colouring, ai
good examples of Green, Red-crested, and Dominican Cardina
The remaining Seedeaters included an interesting pair of Chingoj
Sparrows, Chinese Painted Quail, Diamond, and Zebra Doves.
The Softbill section was quite outstanding, not only for the brillian
of colouring and variety of the exhibits, but also for the number
species which had not previously been seen on the show bench. X

Satin Bower Bird. Humming Birds were also few in number, and the
:lass was won by Mrs. Draper's delightful little Pucheran's Emerald,
1 bird which I am told has now completed its fourth moult in
.aptivity. It was looking extremely well at this Show, and gave the
public ample opportunity to study the remarkable powers of flight
)f these tiny birds. Mr. Sawyer sent a Dusky Jacobin, the first
example to be exhibited, and although of rather sombre hue, it was
nevertheless attractive on account of its larger size and rather striking
vhite tail.
The Sunbird class, as already mentioned, drew from exhibitors the
emarkable entry of 27, and from the Show Manager the comment
hat there could surely be no more Malachites left in Africa ! In
pite of several absentees, the display of these beautiful nectar-feeding
)irds was a sight never to be forgotten, and it was no easy task to
lecide the order in which they should be placed.
Mr. Sawyer s cock Regal, another species appearing on the bench
or the first time, was awarded first prize. It was in perfect condition
nd well displayed all the natural colouring of vivid scarlet, yellow,
netallic golden-green, and blue-black--a very lovely bird indeed!
he class also contained Amethysts, Malachites, Mariquas, Lesser
)ouble-collared, and no less than four sub-species of the Greater
)ouble-collared, including Grauer's, which has the golden-green of
lie upper parts replaced by metallic blue and the centre tail feathers
oticeably longer. Mention must also be made of two Malayan Yellow-
reasted Sunbirds, another species which I believe was exhibited for
oe first time. Less spectacular than the African species on show, they
ave nevertheless great charm, the metallic green of the upper parts
emg well set off by the soft yellow of the breast feathers.
The most outstanding exhibit in the Sugar Bird class, a cock Cape
ugar Bird, was again the property of Mr. Sawyer. It was unfortunate
lat this bird had attempted to murder his mate shortly before judging
mimenced, in spite of the fact that the pair had lived amicably
)gether for some considerable time, and she had to be removed from
ie cage. In spite of this, the cock easily headed the class which was
rovided for any species of Sugar Bird and in which he was therefore
erectly shown, although I feel that the species is so far removed
om the South American Sugar Birds with which we are more
-miliar that the competition was somewhat unfair. An exceptionally
ne cock Yellow-winged was second, followed by a pair of the same
&gt;ecies, a cock Blue and a cock Black-headed.
Zosterops and Pekin Robins were together in the next class, with
3 entries and, in addition to the common Asiatic species, there were
)od examples of the large Cape Zosterop and a delightful and very
aall species which I took to be the White-breasted, abyssinicus.
iveral good pairs of Pekin Robins were shown, but at least one, in

my opinion, was completely spoilt by intense colour-feeding which
had produced an entirely unnatural appearance, the stain having
even penetrated to the feet and claws. Surely the natural colouring
of a really well conditioned Pekin is beautiful enough without artificial
aids.
Among the small Tanagers the most unusual was the winning
Orange-breasted, C. thoracica from S.E. Brazil. A few of these Tanagers
were imported in 1936, and the species was last shown in 1939? an ^
I imagine that the one now being shown by Squadron-Leader Everitt
is the only example of its kind in the country. The same exhibitor
was third with a very well coloured Yellow, and the Class also com
tained a Festive, several Superbs, and Blue and Blacks. Although
the sexes of the latter are readily distinguishable by the very pro-
nounced greenish tone of the hens, it is surprising to find how often
two cocks are shown as a true pair, a mistake which occurred at this
Show.
The larger Tanagers were combined with Bulbuls and Shamas, and
the class contained two examples of the fine large Indian Black Bulbul,
Microscelis psaroides, the broad and distinctly forked tail, high crest,
and bright red beak and legs giving these birds a most striking
appearance in spite of the dull hues of the plumage. Other exhibits
were a fine Orange-rumped Tanager, several good Scarlets,
Striated, Pretre's, and Black Tanagers, and two pairs of Red-eared
Bulbuls.
Two excellent pairs of Shamas were shown to perfection, and a
single cock entertained visitors to the Show with almost continuous
song of quite exceptional merit. Two very distinct types were repre-
sented, the variation being most noticeable in the hens. The common
Indian form, K. macrura , showed the clear grey head with a clean
cut line of demarcation on the upper breast, the chestnut under-
colour being very pale. The other, which I take to be an example
of K. suavis of Borneo, was considerably larger, the grey of the upper
parts being less clear and of a brownish tone, with the marking less
clearly defined. The chestnut colouring of the under parts was much
deeper, in fact little less intense than that of the cock.
Flycatchers, Robins, and Ghats were well represented, and the class
was headed by a delightful cock Tickell's Flycatcher in most perfeci
order, followed by Mr. Sawyer's Natal Robin, which is now well
known on the show bench and was looking extremely well. A very nice
pair of Short-billed Minivets were third. These birds were also ir
really wonderful condition, but the cock unfortunately lacked the
brilliance of the natural scarlet plumage. The class also contained 2
Rufous-bellied Niltava, Noisy Robin, Indian Robin, African White-
throated Robin, and pairs of Verditer Flycatchers and Silver-earee
Mesias.

Fruitsuckers, Thrushes, and Jay-Thrushes were combined in the
lext class, and first place was awarded to a good pair of Hardwicke's
Tuitsuckers, well staged in a most tastefully decorated cage. A Black-
hroated and several Golden-fronted Fruitsuckers were also shown,
ind Thrushes were represented by a pair of American Robins.
Vlr. Anderdon exhibited a very nice Chinese White-eared Mocking
Thrush, and Mr. Whitmore a Rufous-throated Jay-Thrush, and it was
leasing to see that a pair of the attractive White-crested Jay-Thrushes,
Though a common species, were successful in gaining recognition.
The next two classes caused some confusion to exhibitors, as the
irst was for Starlings (True and Glossy and Pagoda), and the second
or any species of Mynah, and it was not surprising to find similar
pecies entered in both classes. However, Mr. Wragg very wisely
ransferred several entries, leaving the first class with eleven Glossy
Starlings and placing all the Mynahs together in the second,
vlr. Whitmore's pair of Amethyst Starlings were first, followed by the
ame owner's Purple-headed. Red-eyed Green, several more Purple-
leaded, Beautiful Spreos, and a Long-tailed Glossy completed the
lass.
The Mynah class had 17 entries, and it was very pleasing to see the
eappearance, after many years, of the charming little Mandarin,
^s might be expected, there were a number of Greater Hill Mynahs,
everal of which subsequently distinguished themselves in the Talking
Contest. The class also contained Southern Hill Mynahs, Malabars,
lank and Jungle Mynahs.
Toucans were represented only by a Green-billed and Lettered
Vracari, but in the same class Mr. Whitmore's Knysna Touraco,
f. corythaix, was a magnificent bird and well deserved the premier
ward. It was followed by Mrs. Draper's very good Hartlaub's
Touraco.
Finally, three classes were provided for Softbills not otherwise
lassified, grouped according to size, and these contained some of the
arest and most interesting exhibits. The class for smaller species was
vr&gt;nby Squadron-Leader Everitt's charming pair of Ixulus, followed by
vlr. Sawyer's Audubon's Warbler, one of the most attractive of the
nany N. American Warblers, with striking plumage of yellow, grey,
nd black. Another N. American species, the Black-capped Chickadee,
vas also shown in this class, together with a Superb Manakin and two
Thestnut-breasted Nuthatches.
There were twenty entries in the class for medium-sized species,
nd again Mr. Sawyer staged the winner, a White-collared Kingfisher,
Tich was a quite outstanding exhibit. It was followed by a delightful
T&gt;rth American Cat Bird, a species which, in spite of its rather dull
olouring, combines the charm of a Shama and active movements of
large Warbler, and is said to have a fine song. Greater Blue-winged

and Hooded Pittas, a Saturnine Mocking Bird, Mexican Clarino,
Pied and Blue-cheeked Barbets, Brazilian Hangnests, Silky Cowbirds,
a Cedar Waxwing, and Yellow-billed Oxpecker completed the class.
The Oxpecker was an interesting exhibit, but it must be admitted
that it did not show to advantage. The wooden perches of the show
cage seemed unsuitable as a resting-place for a bird with feet and
claws adapted for clinging to the broad backs of cattle and game
animals, and would have been better replaced by a rough log.
The class for the larger species was won by Mr. Sawyer's pair of
Roul-Roul Partridges, another very fine exhibit which attracted much
attention and favourable comment. It must be twenty years since
this species was last seen on the show bench in this country. A Steller's
Jay was another species which has been seldom seen here. It was
steady and well shown, but needs good light and ample space to
display the fine purple and deep blue of its plumage to full advantage.
The class also contained Mrs. Draper's rare Geng Jay, a Wandering
Tree Pie, Occipital Blue Pie, and Yellow-headed Marsh Bird.
The section for Parrot-like birds drew a total entry of 80, but
apart from the classes for Lovebirds and Parrotlets which accounted
for half of this total, and contained many good examples of Fischer's.
Masked, Peach-faced, Red-faced, Nyasa, and Abyssinian, a pair oi
Turquoise-rumped Parrotlets and an attractive hybrid Peach-faced x
Fischer's, the numbers in each class were disappointing. However,
the quality of the exhibits left little to be desired, and a number oi
exceptionally rare species were benched, several of which had not
previously been shown. Of particular note were Mr. Sawyer's Racquet-
tailed Parrot, of which mention has already been made, and hr
Salawati King, a superb bird which might well have shared the
supreme award, also Mr. Lawrence's lovely Long-tailed Parrakeet
The class for Lories and Hanging Parrots also contained severa
rare and attractive exhibits, including a pair of Black-capped Lorie:
in very fine condition, a Red Lory, Mitchell's, Musschenbroeks, anc
Ornate Lorikeets and a pair of Blue-crowned Hanging Parrots.
Very nice Plum-headed and Ring-necked Parrakeets were shown
but Australian species were poorly represented, and the large specie:
had only five entries, two hen Red-sided Eclectus, an Orange-wingec
Amazon, Roseate Cockatoo, and an African Grey.

FEEDING SOFTBILLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997155722222222" page_id="58072965"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
By W. D. Cummings (Keston, Kent, England)
As many people seem to be put off keeping insectivorous birds
because they think the feeding of them will be too messy and compli-
cated, I thought it might help to dispel this notion if I put on paper
my own experience with various species.
Obviously, nowadays, one must bear in mind economy when
feeding fruits and it is with this in view that I offer the following
suggestions on food diets. Aviculturists still shudder at the thought
of the trouble and expense involved in keeping softbills, but it is not so.
When their basic requirements are known, also alternatives or extras,
one can create a system, and feeding becomes a routine almost as
simple as filling up a seed hopper.
Softbills generally, through their necessity to hunt for their varied
food supply, and consequent agility, are perhaps more intelligent than
seed-eaters--Psittacine species apart. They consequently give con-
siderably more pleasure to their owners by their habits and colouring,
and once the myth of the difficulties of feeding them is exploded, their
advantages should exceedingly outweigh any other consideration.
One starts meeting snags with softbills when one commences trying to
breed them, but the excitement is all the more after a successful
achievement.
I think it very important in feeding all birds to have a basic diet,
and it is the same with softbills. I also consider that a little variety
does a world of good. The " basic " is the everyday feed, and the
'' various " consists of extras when available. The basic food should
be a complete food that satisfies a bird's hunger and needs, and is
chosen for this purpose, and also because the bird likes it. The extras
keep a bird in tip-top condition.
When our softbills first arrived at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm,
I am afraid they ignore all basic diets and just have their particular
likes and dislikes. We have to pander to them until they are fit enough
to be brought slowly on to their permanent foods--in the case ol
Shamas and Dhyal Birds, their insectivorous mixture. When these
latter birds arrive they revive only on the sight of live food. We supply
gentles ad lib with a few mealworms, two or three a day each. They
have insectivorous mixture by them all the time. After picking up we
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.996157931818182" page_id="58072966"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
reduce the live food after making sure they have taken to the
insectivorous mixture. It is important that the latter should remain
moist and appetizing, and I advise only as much should be given every
day as a bird will eat. It can be moistened daily with grated carrot.
I should stress before I continue that you must be sure that fruit and
soft food is not kept where the sun can dry it, and especially in the
summer one must ensure that the food table is in a cool place where
the food will keep fresh.
To continue with Shamas and Dhyal Birds--once they have put on
a little weight and are fit, a diet of insectivorous mixture and gentles
daily (a couple of dozen) and a few mealworms occasionally, especially
when moulting (about six at a time) should keep them in the best of
health. They seem purely insectivorous and the only fruit I have
found they are very fond of are elderberries, and these I can recom-
mend for all softbills and there is no limit to the amount one can
give--but they must be ripe.
Apart from food requirements, they must have natural perches for
their feet and a bath daily. I don't recommend putting them out
into outdoor aviaries until they have moulted out in captivity, and
then both Shamas and Dhyal Birds do very well in planted aviaries for
the summer, but not together.
For all soft food eaters I thoroughly recommend finely chopped
cooking dates. I find they all like them, and they are very nourishing.
These I give daily to Fruitsuckers, Sugar Birds, Waxwings, Glossy
Starlings, Hanging Parrots, Bulbuls, and Mynahs. This is part of
their basic. Apart from dates and soaked currants I find Waxwings
very fond of a little bread and milk daily. I cannot get ours on to
anything else. Starlings, apart from dates, have a basic of insectivorous
mixture and gentles, and a few mealworms, not more than half-a-dozen
occasionally. Apples, sliced and pushed through the wire netting, and
the dates are the only fruits they seem fond of. I also give them bread
and milk daily. I do consider they need mealworms to bring them intc
breeding condition, as do all the insectivorous birds, but gentles arc
sufficient to keep them fighting fit, and safer.
Mynahs are--as are Pekin Robins--omnivorous, but a basic o
insectivorous mixture, dates, bread and milk, apple, and gentles--
especially in the chrysalis stage--are sufficient to keep them fit anc
healthy. Hill Mynahs are extremely fond of pear and grapes, bu
these are luxuries. If one is feeding them on scraps entirely thei
potato should be their basic.
Bulbuls, Fruitsuckers, and Sugar Birds (Yellow-winged) I find d(
very well on dates, sliced apple pushed through the netting, bread anc
milk (sweetened), pear and gentles, as basic, with either sugarec
orange, banana, or soaked currants alternatively as extras.

nectar--consisting of a teaspoonful each of condensed milk and
honey and a quarter teaspoon of Mellin's Food to a cupful of water_
but as they always seem to neglect this after about six weeks in favour
of the fruit and dates and the rest of the diet, I discontinue the nectar.
I think a small pot of honey and water would probably be beneficial
as well. They don't eat many gentles, and I think a few mealworms
would be appreciated. Minivets are mainly insectivorous, and gentles
and the mixture, with a few mealworms, would satisfy them.
Most of our fruit eaters we get out into outdoor aviaries here at
Keston as soon as they are fit enough, splitting up the more tricky-
tempered birds--to mix Sugar Birds, Bulbuls, Fruitsuckers, and one
Dhyal Bird together in one aviary ; in another, Pied and Bank
Mynahs, Troupials, and Marsh Birds ; and one Fruitsucker and
Shama. They thus have plenty of fresh air and exercise.
Troupials and Orioles seem small eaters--both, I believe, being more
insect than Iruit eaters. Both like gentles (and mealworms), bread
and milk, chopped dates, apple, and need insectivorous mixture
moistened with shredded carrot. I find they hardly touch pear,
orange, or banana.
The already mentioned diets, then, will give some idea of the
fundamental foods necessary to their health, and cover all individual
preferences of the species mentioned--and it could also be safely
and beneficially given to any insectivorous or fruit-eating birds, as
the case may be.

LONDON ZOO NOTES

that had flown on board the ship in which he was travelling when it
was some 400 miles to the westward of Colombo. The bird, a female,
looks very like the Kestrel of this country which, of course, ranges as
far eastward as western Siberia and southward in winter as far as
the Gold Coast, Tanganyika, Arabia, and north-western India.
This specimen appears too pale to be the race ( objurgatus ) inhabiting
southern India and Ceylon.
Squadron-Leader K. C. Searle sent a gift of two Water Cock
Gallicrex cinerea) and three Eastern Greenfinches (Chloris sinica), some-
times called by the dealers the Eastern Goldfinch.
Miss Knobel has presented a Malabar Mynah (Sturnia malabarica ),
also known as the Malabar Starling or Grey-headed Mynah. Two
Cockatiels have also been presented. The donor called them
Quettels ", a name I have been unable to trace, and evidently one
of the Australian local names.

Three Jabouille's Jungle Fowl (Gallus g. jabouillei), new to the
Collection, have been deposited. This is the race from northern
Indo-China, first described in 1928 by Delacour and Kinnear. An
Elliot's Pheasant and two Chestnut-eared Aracaris ( Pteroglossus^
castanotis ) have been received in exchange. This species of Aracari
has been exhibited in Regent's Park only once before : there are
two forms, this one inhabiting a rather small area in north-western
South America and the other, P. c. australis , having a fairly wide
distribution further south.
A Black-headed Plover (Sarciophorus tectus ) has been purchased and
a Black-footed Penguin bred in the Gardens.
The Cereopsis Geese are nesting ; the Emu eggs and those of the
Ceylon Fish-owls were again infertile.
A Red-necked Grebe found exhausted in Sussex was brought in a
few days ago. It is already much stronger and feeding well, so if and
when it recovers the waterproofing of its plumage it will be released.

The evening's programme was advertised as a conversazione, but
it proved to be a surprise presentation evening. First the President
of the Society, Mr. David Seth-Smith, drew attention to the fact that
it was the 10th Anniversary Meeting of the Club. He said that to mark
the occasion it had been decided to present the Hon. Secretaries with
' a token of our gratitude and great appreciation ". This took
the form of a large Dresden china parrot which he handed to
Mr. Prestwich. In the unfortunate absence, due to illness, of Miss Kay
Bonner, Mr. Prestwich accepted on her behalf a Victorian bouquet
of freesias from the hands of Mrs. Seth-Smith.
After the Loyal Toast the Chairman said she had very great pleasure
in proposing the health of the Club's most distinguished member,
Dr. Edward Hindle, who was celebrating his seventieth birthday
within the next few days. In a very gracious reply the Doctor paid the
Club a great compliment when he said for him one of the happiest
and most fortunate things he had ever done was to become a Founder
Member. A large birthday cake was then produced, and the members
and guests rendered the usual birthday refrain in a manner somewhat
unmusical.
Mr. Hylton Blythe said he would like to take the opportunity of
asking Dr. Hindle a non-avicultural question. Under what circum-
stances had he introduced the Golden Hamster into England ? The
Doctor gave a short history of its discovery and re-discovery in Aleppo
and an account of the first breeding in captivity in 1929. Since then
many hundreds of thousands have been bred, and he admitted that

America, has unaccountably appeared in Miami, southern Florida,
about one thousand miles from its natural habitat. The colony, which

It has been suggested that its origin lies in escaped or even liberated

luck in breeding Lovebirds this winter. The temperature is about 5 0
above zero, but I manage to keep the aviary up to 6o*. I have reared
Peach-faced, Masked, and Fischers so far, also some Strawberry
Finch-Silverbill hybrids. At first I thought they were Chestnut-
breasted and Strawberry Finch, but now I feel sure they are half
Silverbill. They look like the Silverbills, but have red rumps : they
sing quite nicely."

H. Murray writes : "It may be worth recording that the young
from the Cordon-bleu-Blue-breasted Waxbill cross are fertile when
crossed back to the Cordon-bleu. T hese Waxbills are, of course, so
closely related that the young can hardly be regarded as hybrids."
Some of the birds bred are : Cockatiel, fourteen from two pairs ;
Bourke's, three, the parents were a young pair ; Nyasa Lovebird, one

The Bourke or Bourke's Parrakeet ? A member inquires why in my
Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity, I refer to Neophema bourkii (Gould)
as the Bourke Parrakeet. Really it is just a matter of preference.
English aviculturists usually call this species Bourke's Parrakeet,
whereas Australian aviculturists and ornithologists almost invariably
call it the Bourke : a few, however, use the less common Pink-bellied
or Blue-vented--Mathews always used the last. Old-time trappers
apparently called it, quite erroneously of course, the Night Parrot.
This Parrakeet was discovered by Major (later Sir) Thomas Mitchell,
naturalist and explorer, on the banks of the Bogan River, New South
Wales, in 1835. It is first mentioned, under the bare name Nanodes
Bourkii, in his Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, vol. i,
p. xviii, published in 1838. It is here merely listed amongst the
specimens deposited in the Australian Museum, Sydney.
Major Mitchell built a stockade near the junction of the Bogan and
the Darling : this he named Fort Bourke after the then Governor,
His Excellency Sir Richard Bourke. Thus, this Governor of a century
and more ago has his name perpetuated by a thriving township and by
one of the most charming Parrakeets.

FOREIGN BIRD KEEPING. By Edward Boosey. With photo-
graphs by Alec Brooksbank. 342 pages. Cage Birds , London,

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.98943516" page_id="58072973"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
pleasantest tasks I have ever been asked to perform. In the first
place the author is one of my oldest friends, and it is always interesting
to read a book by someone you know. Secondly, many of the birds
described in its pages are specimens with which I was personally
acquainted at Keston ; consequently it is filled, for me, with memories
of my very happy association with the Foreign Bird Farm for which
Edward Boosey and his partner Alec Brooksbank are famous.
For instance, I well remember the Banksian Cockatoo illustrated
on page 129, and I shall never forget the thrill of looking into a nest-
box and seeing the brood of five young Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots,
whose photograph appears on page 138, just before they were due to
fledge, and realizing that these were the first of their kind ever to be
reared in England.
Here is a book by someone who really knows what he is writing
about. The author has wisely kept to those species which he has
actually owned himself. He tells us what he knows and has been
honest enough to say when his knowledge of a bird is not complete.
There is, therefore, no fear of anyone being misinformed. Mr. Boosey's
descriptions of the birds he has kept are not only informative, but
lightened with amusing anecdotes. Each account is a fascinating word
picture of the appearance and character of the bird in question.
That is what makes his book such absorbing reading.
To anyone interested in foreign birds this work--the product, as
the author himself states, of 40 years' practical experience--will be
an essential part of his library.

The author is, of course, acknowledged as one of our leading
authorities on parrot-like birds. I doubt if there is anyone living
who has consistently bred year after year and generation after genera-
tion so many fine specimens of rare and beautiful parrakeets. The
section on these birds alone, therefore, is a standard work of reference.
It must be realized, however, that his experience of bird keeping is
far wider than this, and the chapters dealing with finches, softbills,
doves, and pigeons are every bit as interesting and instructive.
Like all good bird keepers, Mr. Boosey has what gardeners call
c&lt; green fingers . His sympathetic understanding of birds and their
ways is apparent all through his book. This ability to know your
birds and to do the right thing at the psychological moment is, to a
great extent, an inborn quality, but to those who wish to acquire it,
I would say read Foreign Bird Keeping with care and you will become
a better aviculturist.
A great asset, without which this book would not be complete, is
the very fine selection of coloured and black and white photographs |
by Alec Brooksbank. Without exception, they are portraits of birds
living at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm at one time or another.
Knowing the difficulties he has encountered in taking these, and
remembering what temperamental subjects the birds themselves can
be, I can fully appreciate the infinite pains which Mr. Brooksbank
has spent on producing these truly beautiful pictures. Nearly every
bird dealt with in the text is represented by a photograph. There are
43 illustrations in full colour showing 58 species, and 7 1 black-and-
white half-tones portraying 82 species.
There is a foreword by Viscount Chaplin, and a good general index
as well as an index of Latin names of the birds.
The book is divided into five parts, namely : Waxbills, finches, and
other seed-eaters ; parrots and parrot-like birds ; insectivorous,
omnivorous, and nectar feeders ; doves and pigeons ; and the last
section contains chapters on housing, general management, and diseases.
It will, therefore, be seen that it is extremely comprehensive, and
covers not only all the commoner kinds of foreign birds likely to come
into the hands of the average aviculturist, but also a considerable
number of the rarer species about which little information has hitherto
been available.

dvice and explanation on the best means of observing birds, selection
nd care of field glasses, and so on.
In the introduction Mr. Henry states that serious study of the
jirdlife of Ceylon may be said to have commenced about a century
go and he gives a survey of the work that has been done and the books
iat have been published.
As is to be expected in a book by G. M. Henry it is profusely
lustrated and the general principle adopted has been to depict the
tore colourful birds in colour and those of duller plumage by black
id white drawings in the text. The author states that in the accounts
the species no attempt has been made to give exhaustive information
id that the purpose of the book may be stated as the provision of a
leans of identifying birds in the field--mainly through the illustrations
-and a framework of basic facts on which students may build their
vn observations. In this he succeeds admirably.
Mr. Henry has not adopted the new arrangement of Orders and
amilies which has now been generally accepted which is a pity, even
Lough he mentions that the book is not intended as a work on
assification and nomenclature but as a help towards " enjoying the
rds."
There are no less than 30 coloured plates depicting 198 species, all
the high standard expected of G. M. Henry, and they are beautifully
produced ; also a very large number of black and white illustrations
id a map of Ceylon. The very reasonable price of the book makes it
ell worth obtaining for the coloured plates alone, and it certainly
ould have a wide demand.

I thought you would be glad to know that I have bred the Salvadori Duck, which
1st be for the first time, as nobody has them in captivity with the exception of
itself; I have twelve.
They live in small parties, being very pugnacious, and no other duck can show
1-If near the breeding pair. In this case the breeders are a trio, two females and a
de. One duck has three babies, the other is still sitting. At this moment the
ungsters are 3^ weeks old. They are almost black and white in colour. It was
ted that they frequently travel on the mother's back whilst swimming in the lake.
iey are an unusual duck and will dive quite deeply if startled and break the surface
or 40 yards from where they dived.
l am glad to give you this first-hand information of what must be the first breeding

Piranga erythromelas and Ramphocelus brasilius.
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
It is to be hoped that our American readers will bear with me in the
writing of this article. For them the matters that are here set down
will in all probability be already well understood. The reason, there-
fore, will be to try and clear up a confusion that exists amongst
aviculturists in other countries ; for without doubt there are many
foreign bird enthusiasts, particularly in the British Isles, who are
unaware that there are two entirely distinct Scarlet Tanagers.
One of these is frequently imported, sold, and shown in Britain :
it is so well known that I shall not attempt to go beyond a superficial
description of its general appearance and habits, except where it is
necessary to draw fine distinctions. This bird ( Ramphocelus brasilius)
is a native of eastern South America which migrates north in the non-
breeding season. But it does not apparently enter the Northern
Continent.
The adult male of this species has black wings, scapulars, and tail
(which is graduated), and the rest of the plumage is of the most vivid,
deep scarlet. The feathers of the head are short and rather stiff,
and give the appearance similar to that of satin velvet. Because they
tend rather to stand erect, there is a texture about the head that gives
an added depth to the brilliance of the colour. This character is
one in which the difference betweeen the males of the two species
is most noticeable. Apart from the head, the red feathering lies
iairly flat, but there is a high, silky sheen on all the red parts. The bill
is black for the most part, but the base of the lower mandible carries a
large, oval white patch. This appears bulbous and swollen.
The female is a reddish-brown bird with dark brown winars and tail,
and the bill lacks the white patch. The juvenile plumage is similar to

the adult female, but in the case of the male there is a suggestion of
the brighter colours to come already apparent. ... r
Mr Alec Brooksbank in his Foreign Birds for Garden Aoianes, refers
to the nest of this bird as neat and dome-shaped, and he describes
the eggs as rather like those of a Song Thrush but smaller. _
The home of this bird is usually in low, marshy country, and it
does not appear to be found far from the coast or in hilly country
The food consists of insects, grubs, spiders, and almost any type ot
fmit.
We turn now to the Scarlet Tanager of eastern North America
(Piranga erythromelas). It differs fundamentally in that it is what is
termed a " hard-bill " or seed-cracking bird. The shape of the bill is
somewhat like that of a finch, only longer, and there are two festoons
or " teeth " on the cutting edge of the upper mandible. This character
is not well reproduced in the accompanying plate, but I was at pains
to show it in the original ! In colour it varies from a straw yellow to
olive green and it is pointed ; the curve of the culmen is shallow,
whereas in the case of R. brasilius the culmen is much straighter lor
most of its length with a much more pronounced tendency to hook
at the tip.
The colour pattern is where the easiest ground for confusion occurs.
In both species it can only be described as vivid scarlet and black.
Moreover, in both, the same areas correspond in colour to a large
degree, and it is only when one comes to examine the two side by side
that the very essential differences become apparent. Reference
to the plate will show plainly the longer wings, and slightly forked tail
of P. erythromelas in contrast to the short wings and rounded tail oi
the other. On the other hand, it does not very well illustrate the
greater extent of black on the scapulars of R. brasilius which are almosi
entirely of that tone, whereas only about half the number of scapulai
feathers on the lower figures are black and the remainder are red.
I have tried to show the differences in the colours of the scarle
areas, and that the bases of these red feathers differ. In the case o
the upper figure these bases tend to be yellow, but in the lowe.
they are whitish grey. . ,
The red of P. erythromelas is not so deep in tone ; it has not th&lt;
silky sheen, and the feathers are of a much softer texture. The red doe
not in any place tend to crimson as it does on R. brasilius , but it tend
rather in the opposite direction in the spectrum, towards a kind o
pinkish-orange. This in itself inclines to vary in different individuals
This brilliant plumage is discarded for the winter, and the mal
becomes like the female except that he retains the black wings and tar
The juveniles of this species are like the adult female, but the cocl
by September of their first year are beginning to show black on t

D. M. REID-HENRY SCARLET TANAGERS OF N. AND S. AMERICA 93
Dining the period that this eclipse endures, the birds migrate south
o Peru and Colombia. There they could well be caught for export,
ind it is probably very fortunate for the birds that the finery is not
vident. If it were so, doubtless many would be taken and sold to
lealers. As it is the native bird-catchers in those parts do not consider
uch a dull coloured little bird to be worth the trouble.
When I had this article in mind I asked several of the best-known
British aviculturists if they had ever had a specimen of this Northern
. anager, and I was only able to find two people who were really
v ell aware of its existence. One dealer said he had once had a Tanager
/ith a yellow beak, but as he had not realized the significance of this
ieculiarity he had parted with the bird and he had no exact knowledge
f where it had gone.
Monsieur Jean Delacour informed me that the London Zoo had
lown a few individuals some years ago, but he was not in a position
} know how they had progressed. It would appear, therefore, that
ery little is known about this bird in captivity, and I would very
luch like to hear from any member in the U.S.A. who has ever
ot to know them well in the wilds of their own land.
Unlike R. brasilius this Tanager builds a very sketchy nest of untidy
ad unsubstantial appearance, usually on a horizontal stem of a tree,
he site may be in heavily wooded country on high or low ground,
r the bird may choose to build in an orchard close to human habita-
*n. The young are fed mostly on insects, but large quantities of
erries are also consumed, and the birds have a particular liking
&gt;r catching early flying moths after the manner of Flycatchers,
hese moths, their larvae and pupae are eagerly sought out and eaten,
aparently in preference to most other foods available at the same
ason, and for this reason the bird is regarded with great favour by
iltivators of gardens and fruit trees in quite a more practical sense
ian merely for its aesthetic and ornamental value to their grounds.

By E. N. T. Vane (Great Missenden, Bucks, England)
As Professor Joad would have said, " It all depends on what you mea
by a strain." Although we have certain species of psittacme birds th:
have bred in our aviaries for a number of years, there is not a sing
well-established strain of any particular species in the country. T ei
is no place to which, in the event of an accidental loss, a breeder ca
turn with confidence that he will be able to replace such a deficient
at any time. . r , r
It is not impossible to establish a strain from one pair ol birds, i&lt;
instance the Brown Crossoptilon was represented in captivity by tv
hens and one cock in 1866. From this modest start over two hundrt
were being reared annually three years later, and it is a fact that 2
the Brown Eared Pheasants throughout the world to-day original
from these three birds. Obviously this was an exceptional case ai
one not likely ever to recur, especially among such vigorous ai
energetic birds as parrakeets. My conception of a strain is somethn
like a stud of healthy breeding birds consisting of about twenty par
such as Mr. Ezra built up with the lutino Ringneck. Until we ha
some serious minded aviculturists capable of undertaking such a ta
we shall not really be in a position to talk about strains.
In years gone by there have been repeated attempts to organi
some control over the breeding of these birds, but it has never work
out so far, and only by building up a substantial stud under one cont.
can any hope of real success be achieved. We already have one exp&lt;
advising novices to start rearing mongrel hybrid lovebirds to introdi
new colours, even before we have reared a single pure bred abnorn
coloured specimen in the country--a most regrettable and deploral
piece of folly. However, in view of the restriction on the import
psittacine birds, it is most desirable that no effort should be spared
build up stocks of the lovely birds we have in our aviaries to-d;
Although the ban exists, it appears to be more reasonably administer
to-day than formerly, and, provided the privilege is not abused, 0
can obtain a permit to import a bird within reason on certain con
tions, which should do much to enable breeding stocks to be maintain
Importing parrots is an undertaking fraught with so many sn
that it is next to impossible to get any respectable birds in on a co
mercial basis. Private importation of very small numbers, if equ&lt;
risky, is much more likely to be considerably less a source of suffer!
and untimely death to the birds, and consequently much more saj&gt;
factory, so long as after doing so there is reasonable likelihood

eing able to produce by breeding some good stock for further
istribution at home.
In 1939 there were at least two varieties of birds established as
viary-bred strains, namely the lutino Ringneck and the yellow
.edrump, which existed solely through the efforts of aviculturists.
icidentally, both of these varieties were sex-linked in inheritance,
here were a number of really good specimens about, but in view of
iis factor, cocks were scarce. Where have these birds got to to-day ?
oth are very scarce and definitely require careful conservation if they
re to remain.
In dealing with the lutino Ringnecks it is a most difficult and
*dious business to build up a good breeding stock owing to the fact
lat they cannot be sexed with certainty until they are almost three
;ars old ; in any event they rarely breed prior to this age when they
tain full adult plumage. To reach the third generation therefore,
hen trying for a special characteristic, is going to take almost ten
&quot;ars. It is not necessary for some genetical expert to point out that
Le young may be sexed from birth if a sex-linked lutino cock is paired
1 a normal hen, as all young hens will be lutino and all the cocks
ill be green split-lutino, and so sexable by colour alone. Any poultry
-eeder or budgerigar breeder knows that. What he could tell us is
here to obtain a spare lutino male. There just are not any about,
id in any case the birds rarely breed before maturity, as already
Lentioned.
Unless some aviculturist, or better still some aviculturists, can gather
me half-dozen pairs that really do breed regularly, there is a real
inger that these birds may be lost to us ere long. If the birds continue
\0x25A0 be dispersed all over the country in " believed " pairs which are
obably of the same sex, where one may die and cause a setback of
ree seasons in replacement, quite apart from capital outlay which is
:avy, then there is a very good chance that enthusiasm will die
id the strain may be lost altogether. Many of the birds are eagerly
ught after by foreign markets, with an equally serious drain on our
vn resources.
Consider the other side of the picture for a moment. It is indeed
1 expensive and challenging task to retain a dozen pairs of high priced
rds housed in large costly aviaries for a minimum of three years,
uring this period they are consuming food and require labour to be
aintained ; apart from the risk of loss through many causes, plus the
sappointment of disparity in the distribution of the sexes, is it
rprising that the finished product is expensive ?
When a census of parrots was taken in 1947 there were 42 lutinos
corded. It is doubtful that there are as many as six true breeding
firs of pure lutinos existing to-day. There is one more little snag
fore we leave lutinos, that is, there are also non-Iinked lutinos in

existence although they have probably died out altogether in this
country. Mr. Ezra proved this in 1933, when two lutino parents
reared three green youngsters. It is just one of those little things.
The position with the glorious " Blues " is a little more promising.
There are now three proved breeding pairs and a fourth should be
old enough to breed next year ; from these birds ten young were reared
this season in England. I believe David West reared two in California
also, but they, of course, are outside the scope of these notes. At th(
moment all these blue birds are in the care of three breeders, anc
therefore have the advantage of some slight provision against accidenta
loss ; and every effort is being made to build the strain up before the)
become too dispersed. Naturally, it will be essential to introduc&lt;
new blood to maintain stamina, and there is also the possibility 0
other colours, but this is very much a secondary consideration a
present. # J
Alexandrines are not everybody's bird. They are large, althougl
quite content with an average sized flight, they are destructive an&lt;
noisy. All the same they are very fine birds, and great favourite
with many. The late Captain Veitch was to be greatly commendei
for his efforts on this bird's behalf; it was a great pity he was unable t
continue this work. I do not know what became of his stud c
Alexandrines, but I doubt that they passed as a complete nucleus int
the possession of one aviculturist prepared to concentrate on buildin
up a strain.
Yellow Redrumps were a simpler proposition. Like their norm,
relatives, they are easily sexed in the nest, comparatively proiifi
(one pair reared ten very good young here this year whereas a Ringnec
usually has four or five and more often three), and finally they ca
rear good young when only one year old themselves. They were &lt;
one time fairly numerous. Where are they all to-day ? Probably man
have been attracted to the overseas market, but they are withoi
doubt rare here at present and the demand far exceeds the suppf
Again, I think that the trouble is due to failure to maintain a real!
substantial stock in one or more centres. Many quite small breede
had pairs at one time, indeed many people had them who did n&lt;
understand what they were really doing. Some seemed to think th.
if they kept a normal Redrump cock in the same flight as a yello
hen he became split. Some went even further and considered that
there was a yellow bird in one of their flights all Redrumps bred
the neighbourhood would be split; that is judging by the number
cocks sold as " split birds " which never bred a yellow youngster
their history. I have acquired some of these birds which, when mat(
to a yellow hen, still had all green youngsters ; it was pretty certa
therefore that the cock was not split. A normal hen cannot be sp
as it is a sex-linked factor, and she is 100 per cent normal. Well, he

we have the writing on the wall. Let us try and increase the numbers
of yellow Redrumps before the opportunity passes.
The safety of the Princess of Wales is rather taken for granted to-day,
in fact many people ask when their price is coming down. Is it safe ?
The exceptional summer of 1955 appears to have been an off year for
them, though through no fault of the birds. The mid-May blizzard
carried off my first rounds, and mice accounted for two more very nice
broods of four. These pests entered the nest through the birds' entry
hole, there was no other way in, and in both cases made nests under the
bottom of the proper nest, with the result that the eggs or young fell
through and were smothered or lost. So in spite of a good season with
most species, the most regular breeders of the lot had a record " low "
with only three fully reared. To be as helpful as possible all these were
cocks. Mrs. Clark, of Bromsgrove, tells me that although she usually
rears about twenty, none were brought up this year through various,
unexpected happenings.
In spite of the fact that there are several people who own an odd
pair of these delightful birds here and there, the number of recorded
successes with them in these isolated cases are few. When these birds
once became rediscovered in Australia, a few fortunate aviculturists
in this country secured some specimens for themselves, only to discover
in the majority of instances, they were not so fortunate after all, as the
birds sent them were often guilty of some secret vice--such as egg
eating, non-sitting, or infertility--and were really nothing more than
useless discards unloaded on the overseas market from their homeland.
One has to be careful therefore when acquiring these birds to ensure
that they are of good origin ; the best plan is to buy good young
birds of the year from parents than can be inspected, the disadvantage
then being uncertainty of sex, a very difficult item with immature
birds. One particular fault against which the unwary should be on
guard is the so-called " snub-billed " or undershot beaked bird. A
number of these were at one time pushed on the market very cheaply,
with the explanation that although some of the young might inherit
the disfigurement, others left the nest perfectly all right. The defect is
hereditary, and can be transmitted by apparently normal-looking
birds bred from parents with this defect. Whenever buying Princess
of Wales therefore remember Ruskin's dictum : " There is hardly
anything in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and
sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price only are this
man's lawful prey."
I know of no one trying to develop reasonable stocks of either of the
other Polyteline parrakeets. True, a number of scattered breeding
pairs rear a family each year--too few, of course--but is any serious
attempt being made anywhere to establish, say, as many as three regular
breeding pairs in one collection ? Both the Barraband and Rock Peplar

are most desirable birds and those who keep them almost invariably
become very staunch adherents to the breeds.
Both Crimson-wings and Kings are now very scarce. Neither were
ever exactly free-breeders, except when the late Duke of Bedford first
had them many years ago and wrote a most enthusiastic article about
Crimson-wings being the easiest parrots of all to breed ; a statement he
unreservedly withdrew later, and not very much later either.
Individual pairs of Kings were much better behaved. To rear
really good young, however, they require a large flight. They are one
of the most showy birds existing and a particularly attractive feature
about them is their silent, owl-like flight, reminding one, if close
enough to hear it, of the rustle of a taffeta gown. Through Sir Edward
Hallstrom's good offices I now once again have two pairs of these
birds. Both pairs are still young, as they were imported before fully
adult, and both pairs succeeded in rearing excellent young last
year, one pair being double brooded. The full significance of this
success is only appreciated by those who have tried importing these
birds from the Continent, where it is far more usual to get an adult
cock and what eventually turns out to be a young immature cock, with
the usual result of scarcity of hens. In most cases there is nothing you
can do about it. Needless to say with this promising, if slender start,
it is hoped to produce a few of these magnificent birds in the next
few seasons.
So with the even more handsome Green-wing King, it is sincerely
hoped that the small stock so laboriously built up by our late president,
Mr. Ezra, may yet be preserved and multiplied. Should it be decided
to disperse the Foxwarren collection it will be a thousand pities and
an irreparable loss to aviculture if one individual cannot be found
who is capable and willing to undertake the responsibility of con-
tinuing this work. When I last saw them over a year ago there were two
breeding pairs and I believe five immature birds. Apart from the
pair in the Zoo, which also breed fairly regularly, these are the only
specimens left in the country, and to split up this nucleus of great
possibility, before the numbers are substantially increased, would in
all probability end all chances of retaining a source of possible future
supplies for English aviculture. It is my firm conviction that only by
adopting this long-term view is there any real chance of eventual
success. . *
For a good many years we have had pretty reliable breeding results
from a number of the Broadtail Parrakeets ; notably among Golden-
mantle, Red or Common Rosellas, Mealies, Stanleys, and to a lesser
degree Pennants and Many-colours. To my regret, when the ban was
removed I disposed of a number of really good pairs of these more
commonly kept species, intending to concentrate on the rarer species.
With the return of restrictions I found it most difficult to replace these

rds with others of equal quality. Although I have rather more rare
lirs than I can comfortably cope with, I am still of the opinion that
lless a number of pairs are maintained as breeding studs, there will
: a definite danger of their being in a rather insecure supply, to say
e least, and certainly they will run the risk of deterioration.
Many-colours reproduced their progeny with me for many years in
irly good numbers, but I did not keep more than three breeding
tirs at any one time. Then one year an ancient pair died, and the
llowing season two cocks and one hen were lost through illness, or
cident, with the result that instead of rearing between a dozen to
^enty young birds, I was reduced to twos and threes. It is proving
lite a problem to re-establish a fair breeding stock ; this illustrates
y point that two or three pairs of a kind are not enough to feel that
species is " safe
Probably the most likely subjects to respond to attempts to build
) real strains are the Grass Parrakeets and the Lovebirds. I am
finitely not asserting that this will be easy, although on paper it
n be made to appear ridiculously so. How many novices have
irted out to make a small fortune from their hobby, and how many
ive given the project up in disgust after a very short time through
irting off on the wrong foot. " Budgerigar mathematics 5 5 make it
simple proposition. You put up twenty pairs of Lovebirds in small
sused " control flights " (Budgies no longer need these now that they
e bred in cages). These pairs average, say, six young per pair in two
oods each season. You can easily get an average of #4 per head
l.r these. Seed will only cost five shillings a week for that little lot.
Du are bound to net about #400 a year. It only wants an A 1 Read
take the lid off that one. But you really do read such things.
Nearly twenty years ago I obtained two lutino Nyasa Lovebirds
unknown sex. They both turned out to be hens, and eventually
me split young were reared. Every effort was made to breed a full
tino without success. I even loaned the split birds to be mated
th other lutinos after I had the misfortune to lose mine ; but it all
me to nothing, and the whole of the stock was lost during the war.
hen the opportunity came to have the one lutino in the country
i)m the collection at Woburn, I was only too eager to try again.
1st season the first lutino ever bred here was raised after three
tempts. Now I do not think lutinos are established here yet, but
meone else is already telling others how they can breed other
ecies of lutinos. They will get no help from me, I abominate
brids ; even when they are undoubtedly beautiful birds that have
1 dy been bred from parents mated together " faute de mieux " I still
nnot bring myself to admire them unreservedly.

Perhaps I should record that the inheritance factor is not sex-linke&lt;
as was expected, indeed as we were clearly informed it was. Bu
this has been definitely proved otherwise, and it is a normal recessiv
inheritance factor. A pair of split birds mated together had four egg
in their first round, three were hatched and reared, all normal ii
colour. The fourth egg had a fully developed pink-eyed embryo dea&lt;
in shell. In their second round there were again four eggs, three wer
hatched and fully reared, all green. The fourth egg was clear. Ar
the lutino embryos weak ? The lutinos successfully reared were fror
the adult cock mated to one of his split daughters. However, ther
are now more than twenty of these lutino bred birds to experimen
with, and although it means a considerable amount of expansion t
go on persevering with them, expand we must or die.
Fischer's are prolific birds and many have been bred since the
became available once more. But I wonder just how many peopl
have bred, say, as many as twenty or even more than a dozen thi
season. Is there anyone seriously trying to attain an output of a
many as ioo or even 200 really healthy Fischer's per annum? Eve
with Fischer's I have no hesitation in saying that I would conside
this a very worthy objective.
Masked Lovebirds are about the most difficult of them all to se&gt;
They are frequently only too pleased to mislead their wishful-thinkin
owners by behaving like a true pair whilst all the time they know the

Another failing is their eagerness to fight at any time on any provoca

least, Masked cannot be kept on the colony system, as it invariabl
ends in chaos with a number of fatalities ; it is generally the cocl
who are the victims too. In this connection I have heard of " rogu
hens " who will kill any male who comes near them, though I hav
never come across this trait personally.
In the wonderful Californian climate, however, Masked Lovebird
are normally kept in colonies with a plentiful supply of surplus nestin
sites, and they multiply exceedingly, whether green or blue ; both ar
equally abundant out there. Although the blues were first discovere
and bred in this country, they have never flourished here ; it was nc

enthusiasts have imported them, but have seemed to meet with dis-
appointment in the venture. One hears of yellow Masked, blues,
greys--which are probably a dilute form of the blue--and even white
birds, but definite information of their colour and ancestry is not
available, and it is to be feared that the bar sinister would feature
largely in their pedigrees. From the number of birds that have come
over, one would reasonably expect some reports of results, but there
remains nothing but an ominous silence.
Blue birds imported direct from California have been really
excellent specimens of good size and colour and robust in health, but
although they have wintered outdoors without heat here, they make
no secret of their opinion of our summer, even the one we had in
1955 I it is a good thing that none of them can talk. Although I am
certain I have some true pairs, they are proving most reluctant
breeders. Some will not go to nest at all, others will not sit when they
do eventually lay eggs, and they are remarkably perceptive in taking
care not to lay an egg when any other respectable Lovebird could be
expected to foster it. They generally wait until it is so late that there
would be very little likelihood of good quality young being fully
reared. Possibly by continual perseverance a strain will evolve from
split bred birds which will settle down in our climate, but the start
is very slow in coming, and I know of some who have already given
up the attempt.
Quite a few normal Masked are being bred, but it is only com-
paratively few. Occasionally one hears of a complete beginner
meeting with considerable success. Usually they record their success
with pride, and indicate how easy these birds are to manage and then,
like the old soldier, they simply fade away. It is a pity that these
people do not realize what a valuable asset they have in a proved
breeding pair of Masked Lovebirds. If only someone had a stud of
twenty proved breeding pairs we might begin to establish them.
Anyway, let us hear no more about crossing blue Masked with Fischer's
or other Lovebirds (or even Budgerigars) to establish new colours until
we have really established a good strain of blue Masked. Any such
suggestion is sheer waste of valuable material.
One species we managed to keep going in very small numbers right
through the war years was the Peachfaced, but new blood was urgently
needed. It was unfortunate, therefore, that such few birds were
imported when the ban was not on, and the few that did arrive were
mostly aviary-bred birds from South Africa, probably almost as
mbred as our own. However, even this was new blood and definitely
helped to improve our stock. The position, though, is far from satis-
factory ; whereas Peach-faced used to rear as many as eight good
young or more each season, the figure is much lower to-day, and
among certain pairs plucking is prevalent and occasional signs of bone

weakness. Before good strains of these attractive birds can be expected,
it will be necessary to import some more, preferably wild-caught
specimens.
It would, of course, be most desirable to get other species of Agapornis
established once more in our aviaries, notably the Black-cheeked, of
which I believe there is only one specimen in the country to-day.
Yet this was one of the most prolific and even-tempered of them all,
moreover it was one that was supposed to be sexable by the colour of
the iris. This definitely is not a sexual distinction in the Masked, as
I have seen suggested, and I am not convinced that it is reliable with
Black-cheeks and Nyasas, but believe it is. There are no Madagascar
Lovebirds and very few Abyssinian, which again are very handsome
birds, even if they are reluctant breeders. To talk of Red-faced
Lovebirds when discussing establishing strains may be out of place,
so perhaps it is best to leave it as an honourable mention.
Probably the greatest field of possibility in establishing strains is I
among the Neophema , and, if we accept Peters' list as correct, this still
includes the Bourke Parrakeet. So far as England is concerned, three
of the seven species can be eliminated at once, namely the Orange-
bellied, the Rock Grass, and the Blue-wing. In passing these over,
I would like to mention that the first named bird has always been
known here since its discovery as the Orange-bellied. In Australia,
however, the name has been varied to Orange-breasted, whether this j
is just to be awkward I do not know ; perhaps it is the fact that in the i
antipodes their inverted position has caused the bird's anatomy to:
slip, as the orange part of the bird is on its belly and not its breast. j
Surely it cannot be on grounds of delicacy that this name has been
substituted. The Rock Grass is generally too lethargic in an aviary j
to breed, and although the Blue-wing was at one time quite plentiful
and a delightful breeder, we just have not any of them here to-day.
The Bourke can fairly well be considered established, but they&apos;
still require care to maintain. Breeding stocks have been kept going i
over the last twenty years without a break, and during the lifting oL
the ban a few sources of new blood were received most gratefully.
I do not agree that these imported birds were superior to our own, some
of them were, compared with some of ours, but some of the newcomers
were definitely inferior to our best birds. Bourkes undoubtedly vary
considerably, and when the systematists get down to them with their
tri-nominal taxonomy they will have a lovely field splitting them into
dozens of minutely varying sub-species. Meanwhile aviculturists
are left to explain why some birds are much duller than others, why
some are much brighter pink, others have brilliant blue frontal bands
in the males, and so on. I am quite satisfied I have had at least three
different sub-species in my time, size being one of the varying factors,
and although I am not putting this forward as an excuse for under-

sized birds, I am making it clear that these differences do exist.
Anyway, there are several sources from which absolutely first class
Bourkes for breeding or exhibition can be procured, although I am
not of the opinion personally that it is suitable for the latter purpose
at all. So well established is it indeed that we are beginning to hear
of colour mutations such as buff-backed and pink-backed birds, which
I believe are not infrequently encountered in Australia, as well as
white or albinos.
The Elegant, whilst not so numerous as the Bourke, is another species
that has been kept going continuously, and has been rather more
fortunate with regard to access of new blood. The demand for these
birds at home, however, is not very great, whereas breeders abroad
seem to appreciate their possibilities more fully, with the result that
more and more of our slender resources are being exported annually
instead of being retained to develop the race at home. If these should
dwindle, it will only be due to sheer apathy on the part of the home
market.
No such lack of interest exists with the last two species, the loveliest
of them all, the Splendid and the Turquoisine, but even here the
demand from the foreign market is a real threat. Home buyers seem
to adopt the rather smug attitude that they will wait until the price
comes down, whereas abroad they are only too anxious to obtain
supplies while they are still available, and are most likely to secure good
quality stock before any deterioration sets in. No man can be blamed
for selling in the best market, that is why this export trade is a real
threat.
Returning to the Splendid, Mr. Holmes Watkins has been breeding
these birds from imported stock for the last two or three years, and
now has a definite strain with a number of breeding pairs. He has
described them as ridiculously easy to breed. Well, they may be, to
him, but why is it that having distributed quite a large number round
the country others are not finding them so simple. There must be
something in his methods that are not fully understood by others,
or we should be hearing of more and more successes. Or do others
just take chances that he does not, and so fail. I consider myself
remarkably fortunate in having done well with them last year with
birds which did not come from him ; I hope I can repeat the per-
formance this year, for I remember being very fortunate with
Splendids before the war. In putting such a sentiment in writing
I fear that I am almost courting disaster. Having reared twenty-two
from three pairs, I am hoping that this year I shall be in a position
to augment the numbers in other collections, but so far I am just
trying to build up a substantial stock before dispersing them broad-
cast. This is an example illustrating what I have in mind when
speaking of established strains of birds, and until there are a number

of breeders with such stocks of various species, I do not really consider
the birds are firmly established. Facts show that once a species
becomes scattered in single pairs in many collections they seem to
dwindle, and that only by building up substantial studs under the
care of one specialist are the chances of developing a substantial
healthy stock at all encouraging.
Turquoisines are not quite as comfortably placed. Although a
goodly number were reared last year at Keston and here, in both
places there was, unusually enough, a surplus of hens. These may be
most useful later on when hens become scarce, as is the general rule,
but meanwhile it seriously retards the rate of progress. Nevertheless,
a start has been made, and although I do not know of other successes,
there may well be a few more left in the country. Again, the source
of my supply was from Australia direct from Sir Edward Hallstrom.
Whilst agreeing that these birds never were quite so easy to manage
as very early aviculturists claimed, I have never found them so
hopelessly prone to disease, accident, and other acts of God beyond
our control as certain other well-known breeders have reported.
Modern, or shall I say, post-war Turquoisines, have been less prolific
than those of half a century or more ago, when they were reputed
to rear three or even four broods of four to six young each. Two nests
of three or four have been the usual number, although I have had
three nests in one instance which were all reared in plenty of time to
avoid anxiety about unfavourable weather before the last brood
fledged. Provided nothing unforeseen happens, there is every hope
that these birds will eventually become more readily obtainable.
It is hoped that these notes do not convey the impression that it is
a next to impossible task to develop the resources we have at our
disposal. Such is definitely not the case, but to attain this most
desirable goal will require considerable effort, patience, and expense
over a fairly prolonged period, and in undertaking the problem there
are more obstacles to be overcome than a newcomer would at first
appreciate.
In my opinion, success is most likely to be won by building up fair
sized nuclei of various species concentrated in a few comparatively
large studs, where as many as possible could be reared regularly
befoie they are broadcast to individual small collections. Only by
taking this long view can one really obtain any feeling of real security
for future supplies. Neither does this profess to be a complete resume
of all efforts being made to accomplish the task, but only examples of a
few with which I am in personal touch. It is pretty apparent that only
by combined co-operation will the goal be achieved.

<bodyText confidence="0.991597853658537" page_id="58072997"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
By Herbert Fooks (London, England)
In the November-December number, 1954, J. P. Newell asks for
formation on the keeping of softbills and you, the Editor, endorse
e sentiments expressed.
Greatly daring (I waited for three issues for the experts to comply
ith this request) I now thrust out my neck in the hope that any
lling axes will fall as lightly as possible.
I take it that Mr. Newell refers to softbills which have already
*en caged and are already taking their food readily, as the treatment
r these and freshly caged birds is different. I can never make out
hy the oriental standby, the basic food for softbills in the East, in
her words " sattoo " or powdered gram, is not used in this country,
is the easiest food in the world to prepare, and has a very high
otein content. I have kept Shamas on this, with certain other
bits, for twelve years and more. However, as gram seems to be
lobtainable here, there is little purpose in enlarging on the subject.
The first thing to do on acquiring a bird is, I would suggest, to
^an it. Start with the feet and claws, then dust or spray it with any
dl-known insecticide--a good home-made one is one part of sodium
loride and two parts pyrethrum powder--and the next day see if
will take a bath on its own, otherwise bathe it gently in warm
iter. A normally healthy bird will almost always bathe of its own
cord. A leafy branch dipped in water is the best way to give
nbirds a bath.
If we take the commonly imported Shama as a standard for feeding
her softbills we should be fairly near the mark for most of the other
mmon species. The principle to apply is, the more restless and
tive the bird the more nourishing its food should be. Shamas are
. the whole fairly sedentary, and also very greedy and wasteful,
:king out any food which gets in the way of some chosen morsel
ittoo avoids this, as it is fed in the shape of a doughy ball and titbits
s served separately). There are several proprietary brands of
&gt;ectivorous food on the market on which birds will do well, but
e's pockets have to be well lined if more than half-a-dozen softbills
s kept. It is, however, not difficult though rather laborious to make
ur own mixture. To offset the labour is the fact that the resulting
xture is very much cheaper than any ready-made food you can buy.
ie basis of the home-made is fish-meal, meat-meal, and biscuit-meal,
lich should be coarse and not fine. It is difficult to give exact
aportions, as the results are judged by look and feel. However,
e part each of fish and meat and two parts of biscuit well mixed

together will make a start. To this is added hot fat until the whc
just adheres together, but is crumbly when taken in hand. This c,
be tinned or placed in glass jars and kept in the cool.
For daily use the following should be added. Hard-boiled eggs
dry the mixture, and grated carrot to moisten it. It is again diffici
to give the proportions, but when picked up and allowed to roll &lt;
the fingers it should crumble, but not too fast. Most softbills w
appreciate a drop or two of liquid honey well stirred in, particular
in the case of Fruitsuckers. Mealworms should be given very sparing]
and this applies to maggots or gentles as well. Bluebottles (home-brec
blackbeetles, moths, butterflies, spiders, and any other insects th&lt;
can handle are all beneficial, particularly those with hard wii
cases as most, if not all, insectivorous birds need roughage. Cle;
water for both bathing and drinking are essential--no bird will batl
in dirty water, although it will readily drink it.
It need hardly be stated that the larger the cage the better, ar
if several perches are used then have them all of different thicknes
Most caged birds have standard perches which allow no alteratic
in grip from one year's end to another.
Starlings and Mynahs may be called omnivorous, and it is as we
not to overdo the proteins as they are very inclined to fatty degenen
tion. The Grackles or talking Mynahs are very prone to this, an
should be given plenty of soft fruit to fill the cavities. Being a heart
feeder the Mynah is in consequence a messy bird, and by far the be
cage to keep them in is one with a double bottom ; the top or
made of wire netting.
Most avian ailments are due to insanitary conditions, often becaus
birds will decant their food into their own droppings, and then pic
them up from the floor. The obvious way to avoid this is by a wire
floor some few inches off the tray, yet cages of this type are neithe
advocated nor obtainable in any shop I have come across. In th
East this is the only cage obtainable, and as the Oriental is probabl
the best aviculturist in the world, he should know.
I would suggest that when a foreign softbill has been newly bough
from a fresh importation, the food offered should be in small quantities
say three times a day. It is also advisable to continue with the sam
food fed by the seller, and any change should be made gradually
It is well known that red and green pigmentation in birds fad&apos;
after cage moulting, and is nearly always the case with such birds a
I anagers, Cissas, Chloropsis, and Minivets, as well as others. Th
chestnut of a Shama's breast will also fade and after several years wil
be noticeably different to that of a wild bird. Sometimes, however
this colour change can be arrested by including in their diet a pincl
of soya bean flour. If the beans are obtainable whole, so much th&lt;
better. I hey should be boiled for 15 to 20 minutes, dried off, anc

en crushed. As this bean has a very high protein content, it should
; fed only in small quantites.
The Fruitsucker or Leaf bird will eat more soft fruit such as grapes,
pe banana, and orange than insect mixture. They are also very
nd of any humming-bird mixture fed in a container which is
)mmonly used for these birds. I personally have kept them for
any years on fruit, sattoo, and Horlicks given liquid. A lady friend
&apos; mine had one for over fifteen years in Scotland, where it was
lowed to fly at liberty in the garden.
My own Shamas in England are given raw, minced herring or
irats mixed with biscuit and hard-boiled egg as a change from their
gular food.
In India I have seen these birds actually catching small fish in the
Idies of a woodland stream. They treated them the same way as a
hrush treats a snail ; by banging them against a stone until they
ere soft and ready to be broken up.
There are many Shamas in England which I consider are being
/rrfed. They sit on their perches wheezing like aldermen, and I
innot help feeling that by allowing them to over-indulge their
&gt;an of life must be shortened.
Most softbills are easier to tame than hardbills, and when feeding
aggots or mealworms these should, when the bird is a new arrival,
5 thrown on the cage floor with the owner standing by. After a
eek or so the hand should be left near the bars of the cage until
ie bird gains enough confidence to pick up the food. When this
is been accomplished with some regularity, retain the insect between
ie fingers until it is taken from the hand.
I personally keep my mealworms in a tin, and when I flick the
I with my nail, the birds immediately come to the bars and crane
teir necks in an effort to see which one will be served first.

108 R. E. B. BROWN -- A FLOCK FRUIT PIGEON AND SOME TANAGERS
My bird was brought to me wounded ; it had been shot throug
the right wing and also had a wound in its rump. When I saw
I didn't think there was much chance of saving it ; also, it wouldn
eat anything. I forcibly fed it on chopped banana and pear--I ha
to keep this up for six weeks and two days. Then it began to eat th
berry called " Lilli Pilli "--but it would only eat the berries whilsj
they were on the branch. It didn't recognize them as food whe
taken off the branch. In another week it began to eat choppe
banana if held in the hand. Now it eats any chopped fruit freel
and also " softbill " mixture. Its wounds didn't seem to worry j
at all--it has now quite recovered from them. These birds must b
very hardy to survive such hardship.
Have these birds ever been kept and bred in England or elsewhere
I am now very keen to get a mate for my bird, although it is ii
immature plumage, and I don't know which sex it is.
Since the end of the war the importation of all birds into Australi;
has been absolutely banned, so that the only foreign birds we ar
ever likely to get are those bred here. When the ban was impose*
I had three red Tanagers, a pair of Scarlets, and a hen Maroon
I thought I would try and breed a domesticated race. I have nov
bred them to seven generations and have thirty-five from my origina
three. I first mated the Scarlets together and then mated a youns
Scarlet cock to the Maroon. Maroons are definitely dominant ove
Scarlets, and although my Maroons all have Scarlet blood, they lool
like pure Maroons and to all intents and purposes are pure Maroons
Anyhow, although I dislike hybrids, I couldn't do anything else, a:
mine were the only ones in Australia. The hybrids are fully fertile-
in fact more so that the Scarlet. Now I have three types--pun
Scarlet, obvious hybrid, and Maroon with a dash of Scarlet blood
The hybrids are very beautiful birds. I still have the original Maroor
hen ; she is still breeding and I got her in 1937.
Of course I know that these birds are not rare and no doubl
have been bred many times in Europe, but situated as we are here
now, an effort should be made to breed a domestic race of any foreign
bird that is available. I am trying to do the same with some success
with Black Tanagers and African Glossy Starlings. I failed with
Blue Tanagers as I only bred cocks and lost the only hen after a
time, and with Western Blue Birds. The latter I found easy to breed
as they feed the young on white ants. But the hens all got a condition
like the French Moult of Budgerigars and I gradually lost them. The
cock Blue Birds didn't get it, only the hens. I have no idea what caused
this condition. Perhaps someone could enlighten me.

By William Conway, Curator of Birds (St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.)
In August, I 954 j a long-awaited pheasantry was officially opened
the. St. Louis Zoo. Then, nearly a year later, we had time to
aluate certain methods used in this display. Numerous inquiries
&gt;m other collections testify to the interest in our solution to the old
oblem of displaying pheasants like the beautiful and exotic birds
ey are, rather than as varied-hued domestic chickens.
In the July I was presented, as bird curator, with the problem of
aking an attractive display in the seventeen enclosures of the new
nstruction. The structure of the pheasantry is conventional ; all
ns have dirt floors and all are backed with shelters. Seven shelters
ay be heated in winter. Because of the well-known digging,
etching, and trampling tendencies of pheasants, all public
:easantries in the United States with which the author is familiar
e rather simply built, with the display yards almost, or entirely,
de of any vestige of plant life or landscaping. The idea of a land-
iped pheasantry is not a new one, but certainly sadly neglected,
any of our most prominent aviculturists, and Jean Delacour in
rticular, steadfastly recommend planting and more naturalistic run
iplay. With the encouragement of our friend Jean Delacour and
eking of Director George Vierheller, we resolved to attempt a
idscaped pheasantry.
We discovered that " flat ", " bare ", " plantless ", and " mech-
ical " were all adjectives which might well be applied to an
attractive pheasant yard. Visitors might never guess, from a yard
this description, that stones, logs, or even plants existed in the
*rid of pheasants. After careful investigation, we decided that no
rd should be flat, that a natural and pleasing use of log and stone
.s indispensable, and that all yards should be planted as profusely
satisfactory display permitted; furthermore, some suggestion of
* tropical or temperate nature of a pheasant's habitat should be
empted.
fuly is scarcely the best month for planting and landscaping in this
itude, but our small crew doggedly seeded, transplanted, and
itoured through the record 112* F. heat of that summer. Pens with
ated shelters were prepared for such comparatively delicate tropical
ms as Peacock Pheasants, Firebacks, Argus, Ocellated Turkeys, etc.
tese pens were planted with a species of dwarf bamboo, hardy here,
d pampas grass. Stump and log perches were draped with Spanish
&gt;ss. Pens with unheated shelters, intended for the hardier forms,
re planted with various combinations of: pfitzer juniper, spiny
eek juniper, Andorra creeping juniper, Japgarden juniper, mugho

Swiss mountain pine, and pyramidal arborvitae, as well as pampa
grass in some cases. Under our conditions, pampas grass has provei
successful with all but the most destructive forms. Like most grasses
it is most palatable in the spring growing period and must be protectee
from some species at this time. Our runs lie over a " rip-rap " lime
stone bed. This rules out azaleas and rhododendrons with their acic
soil requirements, which might have made a nice Tragopan habita
background. Mugho pine, however, adds a very natural appearance
to the Tragopan run.
Ground cover always presents a problem. Perennial rye gras:
was chosen as a quick grower of relatively low palatability. All run:
were started from seed. This grass has proven successful, despite it:
late start, in twelve of the seventeen runs, including the following
Siamese Fireback, Vieillot's Fireback, Argus, Germain's Peacocl
Pheasant, Palawan Peacock Pheasant, Swinhoe, Edwards's, Satyi
Tragopan, Himalayan Monal, Ocellated Turkey, and Green Peafowl
unsuccessful with Reeves's, Lady Amherst's, Golden, Silver, anc
and Blue Eared Manchurians. Short of pegging wire down, the
Eared Pheasants have, thus far, kept a very substantial lead ovei
attempts to maintain grass on their runs. However, we have beer
able to maintain a fair stand in the Impeyan runs. As the Monal:
cultivate the soil, we sow seed and find it, rather amusingly, a
successful division of labour.
The use and placement of logs and stones in cage decoration bring:
a subjective factor into cage design. In display composition it is ofter
difficult, indeed, to analyse why an exhibit looks so much better
with such and such a stump here and a very certain stone there. A
change in face or position in one of these display props may make all}
the difference between an eye-catching scene and one that is vaguely 1
disturbing or unnatural. A decayed, fallen log or large stone should
not, of course, teeter lightly on top of the soil as though it were ready
to fly away at the least breeze. Logs and stones are a part of the soil
and should appear to grow from it. Widely different rock types look
unnatural together and freshly quarried rocks are taboo. We have
used worn, weathered limestone. Beautifully gnarled and twisted
cedar (Juniperus rubra) comprises most of our perching space and
" natural " wood features. Cedar weathers well and resists the inroads
of insects.
Another feature, which we insisted upon in each display, was a
pool. Yes, we know that a pool is not a necessary part of pheasant
culture; neither is an attractive pheasantry. A pool in a pheasant
display is, and should be, nothing more or less than an artistic tool
whose shape and position complete a focal point for the yard com-
position. Under no circumstances should a pool be round, or square,
or some other man-made geometric figure. A pool must have the

*pearance of a plastic, free form, as it does in nature. A limestone
at area, several inches deep and wide and covered with sand, may
rround several banks of the pool to avoid any objectionable damp
aces which might develop. The pool should be fitted with an
erflow and allowed to overflow slightly at all times
Speaking last of that which must come first in actual construction,
5 turn to grading and contouring the soil of the run. This conception
apparently quite new in run design. While some collections have
en able to take advantage of natural slopes and dips, planned
ntouring from an aesthetic as well as drainage viewpoint seems to
,ve been mostly overlooked in pheasantries. Contoured ground,
are than any other factor, lifts the pheasantry from the barnyard
iss to a display of exotic beauties. Each exhibit of the pheasantry
mds, in this way, by itself; a small, but attractive, little world
habited by a foreign gem shown off to the best advantage by its
;ting. This very important feature of the new pheasantry usually
nsists of nothing more than a gently sloped dip which winds down
rough the centre of the yard in gradual curves. Rocks are set
)ng the edges of the dip, forming small ridges, and roots from
gathered stumps may project into it. The " dip " acts very practically
drain excess rain to a surface drain at the rear of each run and
ows us to water the display yards.
Needless to say, there are many additional plants and experiments
: are trying and hope to try in the future. Our bamboo withstood
3 * F. below zero and, while our climate makes it impossible to
instruct actual native plant backgrounds for our pheasants, we
|ve been able to give some suggestion of the species appearance in a
|.te of nature.
It is lovely, indeed, to stand on the perimeter of a small jungle
me where a Peacock Pheasant may suddenly emerge from lacy
mboo and display in a small clearing to his lady love, while Crowned
jeons in the foreground continue their incessant preening; to watch
pant Argus flutter down from a gnarled stump to drink at a crystal
nd; or to see an Ocellated Turkey strutting in a clearing with
mboo backdrops and Spanish moss curtains. These are scenes our
itors carry away. Perhaps the best testimonials for the landscaped
easantry have come from the many visitors who have paused to
amine and enjoy the yards, even when the birds are confined to
alters.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
Despite the deserved popularity of the Rosellas as avicultura
subjects, only a few of the members of this group have been ven
common here in California. The only plentiful members are the Blu&lt;
Rosella and the Red Rosella and the Pennant--and they are not seer
too frequently. The Stanley and the Brown's have always been or
the scarce list and have always been practically unobtainable
Adelaide, Yellow, and Green Rosellas have been almost unknowr
and I do not recall ever having seen a pure Green Rosella. But, t(
get back to the topic, I should add that the first really successfu
importation of Brown's Rosella for avicultural purposes would appeal
to be the pairs obtained from the Keston Foreign Bird Farm in the
early 1930's. These birds were sent to the late I. D. Putnam, of Sar
Diego, and they bred for him on many occasions.
Mr. Putnam once told me that the Brown's usually nested durim
January in the mild climate of San Diego. This did not worry him
because many Australian birds began nesting in January. Brown'
generally do not change their nesting habits and continue to nes
during the correct Australian season, regardless of the fact that the]
may be north of the Equator. Luckily for Californians, this is not tb
drawback it would be to aviculturists living in colder regions.
Unfortunately, the species does not appear to be as prolific as it
Red or Blue cousins, and Brown's became increasingly scarce ii
California and eventually all but disappeared. Their rarity wa
helped along by the male's rather unhappy habit of indulging ii
considerable amounts of wife-beating during the breeding season
As always seems to be the case with rarities, the few Brown's lef
began to become increasingly vague about the correct procedure t&lt;
follow in raising a family, and finally, by the late 1940's, there wer-
only two or three good specimens left in private California collections
and even the zoos were in very short supply.
Having read of the beautiful hybrids to be obtained from a Brown'
X Red Rosella cross, when a chance came to trade some very nois&apos;
Chocolate-throated Conures for some extra Brown's cocks the exchange
was quickly made.
The birds arrived in fine condition and really were as lovely as thi
species can be. Incidentally, one should add that not all aviculturist
and naturalists are in agreement as regards the beauty of this species
The Australians sometimes refer to it as the " Smutty " Rosella an&lt;

D. M. WEST-BREEDING NOTES ON BROWN'S ROSELLA I 1 3
The birds were friendly for two cocks--and it was many months
&gt;efore it was discovered that one cock fed the other " cock As in
ome of the Asiatic parrakeets the cocks feed each other and I have
.Iso seen this among other Rosellas, I still did not tumble to the fact
hat the two birds were a pair and not two males as had been originally
upposed.
During the 1953 season it became apparent from their actions that
hey were a true pair and were anxious to breed. Great interest was
hown in the nest, but nothing eventuated, probably due to the late
late the nest was introduced. During the year the male began to
)ick himself and he has continued to pick the feathers on his breast
:ver since. Thinking that mites might be the cause, the bird was
:aught and dusted with powder several times, but with no apparent
esults. He seemed to enjoy bathing, so a fine spray was turned on
:ach day and, though this opportunity was utilized almost every day,
10 improvement in condition followed. Finally, it was decided that
unflower might be the cause and so this seed was gradually with-
drawn, and still there was no improvement. All hemp and other
leafing seeds and foods were completely eliminated from the diet
or several months, but again without apparent result.
During the summer of 1953 it was felt that a change of scene might
)e beneficial and the pair were transferred into a new aviary, 19 feet
ong, 3 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. They seemed happy in the new home
ind the cock indulged in considerably less wife-chasing than in the
firmer smaller home.
As Brown's are so notorious about desiring always to be in a
amily way at every season other than the right one, it was decided
:hat a nest-box could be hung during January and take a chance that
:he weather would not be too severe. Actually, many Australians,
"uch as Bourke's and Elegants, will start nesting operations during
this month and, as some of the Asiatics, such as Ring-necks and
Plum-heads, also start this early, it was felt that this was not too serious
1 risk to take. Two boxes seemed adequate ; one was about 4 feet
nigh and a foot wide and a foot deep, while the other was smaller and
ibout a foot high, wide, and deep. Both boxes were hung under the
shelter. The nests were filled with damp wood shavings and had
been thoroughly cleaned prior to being hung.
I had guessed that the larger box would be the one favoured for
the enterprise, but I was very much mistaken. From the very first the
smaller box was very much favoured and only two or three visits
to the larger box were made. It is interesting that the smaller nest
was instantly picked as the desired one. I had no sooner put the
boxes up than the male began investigating them. The male would
fly to the entrance and cautiously put his head inside and then call

excitedly to the female. She would sit near the box and, after a short
period, would fly to the entrance hole and also investigate.
During late February the pair were seen to mate and the female
began to stay in the box during the day. After about a week the
female began to sit at night also. After incubation actually started
the hen sat very tightly and was seen so seldom that it was sometimes
wondered if she were still alive. When a little poa annua was put in
the male would usually make a few soft calls and very shortly after
the female would then come out to eat. Sometimes, however, she
would not respond to his calls and would not be seen for four or five
days at a time.
Twenty-one days were allowed for incubation. An additional
seven were allowed before the nest-box was inspected when the hen
was found off one day. The nest contained one chick several days old
and three eggs, two of which were clear and the other fertile, but
which eventually failed to hatch.
Realizing they had only one chick to feed, it was then understood
why the male had not been seen cracking seed too frequently or ever
show signs of impatience or excitement when the greens were being
brought. The one item that really filled him with activity would be
the handfuls of poa annua that would be given in the morning and
again in the evening. This he would immediately attack and spend
long periods of time going over all of it to be sure that all the small
seeds were eaten. This small grass is a universal favourite among all
the birds in the collection and, for this reason, must be rationed so
that all may have their share.
During this period the male would consume large amounts of hemp
in preference to other seeds. Only on rare occasions would he go to
the entrance of the nest and call the hen to come out to eat. Generally,
he flew to the top of the nest and there would call to the hen, who
would then appear in the entrance, survey the situation, and then
leave the nest. If anyone were present in the yard, she would imme-
diately return to the nest and wait until no one was about--despite
the fact that she is a very tame bird.
During the entire period the youngster was in the box I never
heard any sounds coming from the nest. Usually young birds being
fed are plainly audible, but not the young Brown's.
1 he most interesting thing, and also the oddest when one compares it
with the other members of the Rosella family, is the fact that the female
Brown's brooded the chick constantly until about the twenty-first
day. Usually a female Rosella will quit brooding at night after
about the tenth day, and sometimes this is productive of fatal results
if the nights are cool. I am quite sure that if the Brown's had quit
brooding the solitary chick would have died as the nights were still
very cool. I could not help but wonder if she instinctively realized

that this was the case ? That she continued all during the first three
weeks to brood during the entire day is another very interesting point.
Usually the average Rosella will leave the nest for considerable periods
of time during the day after about the tenth day.
After the twenty-first day the hen no longer returned to the nest at
night. This is always a worrisome time to me as I have found that
if the nest is going to be deserted or fed poorly it is along about the
start of the fourth week that this will occur. However, all went
smoothly, and the daily amounts of poa annua were eagerly consumed,
so I could only conclude that all was well with the youngster, even
though I did not see the hen going to the box.
On the morning of the thirty-first day I noticed the young Brown's
perched on a twig. Walking closer to the bird I was very much
surprised to find that it remained quite steady and absolutely calm.
Perfectly feathered, the bird most closely resembled a paler version
of his mother. I was especially pleased to note the good size of the
bird--quite superior to either parent. What a pleasure it was to see
the bird fly. Instead of crashing into all available objects and then
dropping to the floor panting and exhausted, the bird flew perfectly
and steadily. Generally young Broadtails are nervous and very
unsteady for the first few weeks, but not the young Brown's. One
could only gasp in amazement at the slow flight and the perfect
landings.
During the next few weeks the bird began to learn to pick up seed.
After the first few days the mother no longer paid much attention to
her offspring, and the father took over the complete care of the
youngster. The father continued to feed the bird long after this was
necessary, and this fact would lead one to guess that the sex of the
youngster might well be a female.
When the youngster was about five weeks old the parents were
seen to re-mate. Feeling that their attitude toward the youngster
might change if a new family were contemplated, the youngster was
removed to another aviary. However, the parents shortly after this
fell into a heavy moult and the second nest never eventuated.
It should be added that this breeding took place during the 1954
season, but that, until now, there just did not seem to be any time to
put these notes down on paper.

By Sir Edward Hallstrom (Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
My aviaries have continued to produce a large number of African
Lovebirds of the four species--Fischer's, Masked, Black-cheeked,
and the Peach-faced. Several hundred have been reared. Of the
Scarlet-chested Parrakeets there were fifteen, and several Black
Cockatoos. The pair of Glossy Blacks did not go to nest this year.
Their youngster is now a magnificent male, in perfect health. Over
forty lutino Indian Ring-necks have been produced for the year.
At Taronga Park I carried out an experiment by putting together
all the Quaker Parrots we had in one large cage with ample facilities
for them to be able to nest, and provided them with plenty of small
sticks and brambles. It is impossible now to tell how many we really
have. The number was about fifteen. I have counted over fifty on
the ground, but know there were large numbers still in the nests.
In this way this interesting bird has made a very nice display.

manner, about fourteen pairs being put in a large aviary facing the
sun, with ample protection from our cold southerly and westerly
winds. At the moment there are a number of babies. In my personal
collection the pairs have been kept in separate enclosures ; a number
of youngsters have been produced each year. There are some in the
nest at the moment. Where colony breeding is undertaken for this
purpose, great care must be taken immediately the birds leave the
nest. The parents seem to lose contact with them, and fail to feed
them on many occasions. These birds are taken to the Bird House,
and in a few days are feeding on fruit such as banana, apple, and paw
paw, boiled maize and sunflower seed being offered as they mature.
When rearing in separate aviaries the parents almost invariably
complete the feeding and rearing of the youngsters after they have
left the nest. There are some advantages and disadvantages in both
methods of breeding. In the single aviaries often birds will not accept
the mate that has been given them. One magnificent bird that talks
quite well has, over five years, not accepted any mate. There are
four or five others in the same position. I am at the moment building
an aviary which will enable me to put these birds together. I hope
that this method will give them a new outlook with regard to the
opposite sex.
The breeding of the Eclectus Parrot is a very simple affair. All that
is needed is proper accommodation, a suitable mate, plenty of fruit,
sunflower seed, and an abundance of boiled maize. My experience
has shown that where the aviaries are fairly narrow, say up to 5 feet

wide, with a considerable length of 20 feet, birds will rarely go to the
floor, remaining on the perches and in the nest-boxes most of the time.
Where the birds are in a colony, and the floor space has been enlarged
to something like 30 feet by 30 feet, they do go to the floor, pick
up some sharp grit, pieces of fruit that may have fallen to the ground,
whereas in a narrow aviary, anything that falls to the ground is lost.
The method, therefore, for a narrow aviary is that the food must
be shredded so that the mouthful that the bird picks up is eaten,
whereas in the colony cage, fruit of a larger size may be fed in trays.
The trays used are about 2 ft. 6 in. long by 18 inches and 2 inches deep.
In the smaller aviaries the food container with their shredded food
slides in through the wire at the front.
At the time of writing there are two African Grey Parrots just
feathering. The parents are a nice tame pair of birds and are doing
quite a good job in rearing these youngsters. They are fed with
shredded fruit, apples, bananas, and paw paw, boiled maize, and
sunflower seed. Great care is always taken to see that no food is left
overnight in their aviary, as mildew and contamination during our
warm and humid weather may be fatal to the youngsters.
My Red-bellied Conures at the moment have three lovely babies.
The Musschenbroek's Lorikeets have two babies. These birds, of which
a number have been reared, present a very serious problem in the
aviary. They rush into their nest-boxes, although they may be placed
as far as 25 feet from the front of the aviary, sometimes with fatal
results to the youngsters. It is very disappointing to take a dead
youngster from the aviary, with a crop full of food, well knowing
that the parents' habit of rushing to hide themselves has been
responsible for the loss. I have long since discouraged visitors during
the breeding season.
During the season 1954-55, I reared only two Macaws. They were
Blue and Yellow, and abandoned their youngsters just about the time
they should leave the nest. It was noticed that the parents did not
take their lettuce, boiled maize, or their fruit, and began to confine
themselves to sunflower seed. This was a clear indication the
youngsters were not being properly fed and examination revealed
that the youngsters had nothing in their crops. They were taken
immediately from the parents, and were successfully hand-reared.
It is far from easy to hand-rear Macaws at that stage, as they are
strong enough to resist, refuse to accept any food fed to them by
spoon, and put up such a struggle that it is not an easy task, whereas,
of course, if the birds were taken when younger they readily accept
their food. These two youngsters were finally reared with the aid
of a syringe, having 30 c.c.s of food at each feeding. Examining the
nest a few days ago, I found two more half-reared Blue and Yellow
Macaws. The time required for the hatching of the Blue and Yellow

Macaw is similar to the Red and Yellow, twenty-five days. This has
been carefully tested in the nest and in the incubator.
I am wondering if any of the members of the Avicultural Society
have seen a Golden-shouldered Parrakeet. I had never seen one until
three years ago, when I procured two males. Having no females,
I gave them Hoodeds. They were friendly immediately, and soon
went to nest, producing between them some sixteen youngsters. Some
males are in Taronga Park. I kept three pairs for myself. They are
the prettiest of all the birds I have, much prettier than either of the
parents ; breast and neck are a beautiful turquoise colour, the wing
patches are much larger than in the Golden-shouldered, and slightly
smaller than the Hooded. It is always thrilling to look at the rare
beauty of these three pairs of birds. They are now old enough to go
to nest in the forthcoming season, due in April-May. I am wondering,
and I should soon know, whether these birds are closely enough
related to be fertile.
I now have four pairs of pure Golden-shouldered Parrakeets.
These are fully-matured youngsters, from which I am hoping for a
bumper crop of babies. They lay five or six eggs. I am sure my
collection of pure Golden-shouldered are the only ones in captivity;
I have altogether seventeen. I am not prepared to part with any
of these birds, preferring to breed from them myself, and then dis-
tributing them amongst aviculturists who would appreciate these
rare things. Provided I handle them carefully and jealously I am sure
I will be able to reintroduce this bird to aviculturists both in England
and Australia.
This past season I gave the two male birds very brightly-coloured
Many-coloured females. Both males fretted, and would have nothing
at all to do with the Many-coloured hens. I persisted long enough
to have lost this past season's breeding. I again gave them Hooded
females. The birds were once more happy and perky, displaying
to the females, and they now show every indication that they, too,
will take up housekeeping very soon.

(about the middle of August) in an outside flight in a box tree, one
of several against a wall at the end of the flight. The nest appears
to be not unlike that of a Bullfinch, but I am afraid I never saw the
eggs and did not find the nest till after the young had hatched. When
cutting the brambles I thought I saw two young birds, but was not
certain ,* later I found one young bird dead. About fourteen days
afterwards I was in the flight and saw the second one flying about.
My birds always had the usual foreign bird mixture consisting of
millets and canary seed and I managed to get a few mealworms,
and also gave them some pre-war paddy rice which the parents
seemed to like as they took quite a lot of it. I also gave green stuff
such as groundsel and chickweed, but was too busy to watch the
feeding of the young birds.
I understand this species has not been bred in England before.

If Francis H. Rudkin could have had a premonition about 8th April,
1956, he would have looked forward to that date with great happiness,
for to him it would have meant a reunion with his beloved wife
(" Little Mother ", as he always spoke of her to me), who had " passed
on " some few years previously.
They had had a very long and happily married life together and
when he spoke of her it was as of someone who had left earlier than
he on a long and distant journey and that when he had finished what
he was doing he too would set out and join her. He will now lie by
her side at Bardsdale, in one of the world's most moving and beautiful
burial grounds (not far from the delightful little township of Fillmore,
in California), a few acres of deep green lawns with small, unobtrusive
headstones, planted with beautiful shrubs and tall, graceful palms,
for ever whispering in the breezes that always blow up the valleys.
The whole is surrounded and enclosed by tall green hills over which
seems fondly to brood the peace of the Ages. A fitting resting place
for a kind and gentle soul who brought the graciousness and courtly
manners of a bygone age into the present one.
Born in the English " Shires " and emigrating to California with his
family when he was over fifty he still retained his English accent and
one felt about him the quiet, unhurried life of an English village of
a hundred years ago. That was perhaps why he was so successful with
birds. He extended to them that gentle and quiet patience they respond

to. He had a " presence " and kinship with living things they all
recognized.
Francis H. Rudkin truly loved birds ; any sick or ailing feathered
creature he treated like a parent treats a sick child. I have never seen
anyone so kind and tender with a bird as he. Whenever he looked at
one his whole face lit up.
We had many pleasant little excursions together during my last trip
to California in 1950-51 and they will always be one of the happiest
memories of that beautiful and friendly country. He was over 90 then
and we always joked about my coming to see him for his 100th
birthday but, alas, that was never to be. All arrangements were made
for a trip there in 1955, but owing to illness they had to be cancelled.
Mr. Rudkin's death marks well over a century of aviculture in the
Rudkin family for his father before him, in the first half of the
nineteenth century, was a well-known breeder of British birds,
canaries, foreign birds, and especially hybrids.
Between them Mr. Rudkin and his son, Harold F. Rudkin, had a
vast assemblage of aviaries and flights, over 150 in all, which contained
what must have been one of the world's finest collections of parrot- like
birds, these included a great many rare species which will be mentioned
in a later article.
Aviculture in America owes a great debt to Francis H. Rudkin for
his unremitting care and patience in breeding and keeping pure at
least five species of Lovebirds, of which he bred and distributed vast
numbers. He also established the blue Masked Lovebird, which is now
as common in the U.S.A. as the green variety. In addition, he main-
tained five varieties of Peafowl, though one was really a hybrid (the
Spalding's), originated by the late Mrs. Spalding and the progeny of
the Javan Green and the Black-winged, a huge and magnificent bird
with a lot of bright yellow skin about the face. Mr. Rudkin was
especially proud of his flock of white Peafowl, which lived around the
homestead as tame as domestic fowls. Besides the Peafowl there were
also many species of rare pheasants.
He had a wonderful aptitude for life and even at 90 could be seen
on a ladder mending the top of an aviary or out-building and, with the
aid of someone for an hour or two a day, he looked after his huge
collection of birds himself. Of great independence of spirit, he lived
alone except for the daily visit of a friend who cleaned up and prepared
a midday meal. However, a short time before his death he went to
stay with his son Harold. Even then he was still active--I received
a letter from him only two weeks before he passed away.
He once confided to me that on occasions when any of his birds
escaped or wandered away and were shot by thoughtless neighbours
" in the mistake for hawks " (it's amazing how colour-blind bird
shooters usually are) he always asked that the name of the killers should

not be divulged, as he never liked to bear a grudge towards anyone
and that he could not have helped feeling bitter towards the slayers of
his feathered friends.
It was a great happiness to Francis Rudkin to think that his son
Harold was carrying on with the family's avicultural tradition and that
at his death his collection would not be dispersed.
I am afraid that we shall never see his like again, for he belonged to
a bygone age which will never return, when life was lived at a more
even tempo and humans found their happiness in simpler and more
substantial things than now and when integrity and morals had a more
significant meaning.
All those who met Francis Rudkin were at once impressed by his
gentle charm and inherent kindliness and one felt all the better for
making contact with such an outstanding personality.

The pair of Cereopsis Geese presented during 1954 by the Zoological
Board of Victoria nested again and hatched three goslings early in
March. One of these died at an early age ; the other two are now
nearly half-grown. The aviary of " homing " Budgerigars has been

A pair of Satin Bower-birds have been put into the large Waders'
Aviary in the hope of some breeding success. The male, a fully coloured
bird deposited by Dr. Marshall, soon made a bower of twigs and
decorated it with pieces of blue cloth, peanut shells, dead leaves, and
brown feathers. He displays to a young bird still in the green plumage
(one of those presented by Taronga Park in 1954), but in case this is
actually an immature male, an older bird (a certain female) has a so
been put in. As is usual, the bower is orientated approximately north
and south--this is actually almost north-west-south-east---and the
male has been supplied with some charcoal with which to paint
the twigs. This is done by breaking the charcoal into powder in the
beak, mixing it with saliva, and applying the " paint " thus produced
to the twigs with a wad of bark or piece of twig. Fruit pulp as well as
charcoal is used in the wild state by Satin Bower-birds. Blue objects
are the most sought after by them for bower decoration ; brown, yellow,
and grey ones are also collected, but not red or white. This species
builds a simple avenue of twigs but, of course, some of the others, such
as the '' Gardeners ", make much more elaborate structures, including
a lawn of moss in the front of the bower, using as decoration flowers
and fruits which are replaced as they fade or lose their colour, beetles
wing cases, feathers, and so on, provided that they are of a colour or
lustre to the taste of the individual species. The nest of the Satin
Bower-bird might be some distance off, the female only being occupied
with it and the care of the young while the male continues to maintain
the bower until the young leave the nest, when he joins the family and
goes off with them. .
Little is known about the Bower-birds of New Guinea. Dr. Marshall s
recent work The Bower-birds, Their Displays and Breeding Cycles is the
result of his studies over the past twenty years, yet he claims for it no
more than a " preliminary statement " on what has been desciibed as
one of the strangest and least understood phenomena in nature.

Wood.
Members of the Club, 41 ; guests, 27 ; total, 68.
The Chairman, opening the meeting, said she had great pleasure in
welcoming several important guests : Miss Ruth Ezra, Lord Evershed,
Master of the Rods, Captain C. W. R. Knight and Esmond Knight.
The last two were wed known in their own right, but they were ready
only present on this occasion by virtue of the fact they were attendant
on k ' The Great Mr. Ramshaw ". It was in September, 1949, that
" Mr. Ramshaw " was last a guest of the Club. The intervening years
had dealt kindly with him and he now appeared to be in, if possible,
even finer feather, despite his 28 years.
Captain Knight was in reminiscent mood and, in his inimitable
manner, recalled some of the startling experiences that had befallen
the pair of them during their world-travels together.
The sustained applause of the audience indicated their appreciation
and enjoyment of this remarkable and unique partnership.
" Mr. Ramshaw " later held court with great regality except, let it
be but whispered, he forgot himself to the extent that he " white-
washed " a lady member&apos;s dress, but, in extenuation, this was due to
interference by a third party.
This was the last meeting of the 1955-56 session.

/ogelbilder aus Fernen Zonen-Papageien. By Anton Reichenow.
Second edition, edited and enlarged by Joachim Steinbacher,
with the collaboration of Hans von Boetticher. Verlag
Gottfried Helene. Pfungstadt Darmstadt, Germany. Price
120 DM. (#10 10s.)
Dr. Reichenow's monumental work on the parrots of the world
vhich was published in 1883, and which is a classic in books of its kind,
las been extremely rare for the last twenty years, and those copies
vhich have been obtainable have commanded a price far above that
lossible for the average aviculturist. The initiative of Dr. Steinbacher
11 preparing a second edition of this book is therefore received with
he greatest satisfaction. Dr. Steinbacher states in his foreword that
vhen he was considering the possibility of writing a book on parrots
or ornithologists and serious aviculturists it soon became apparent
hat none could better that of Reichenow. The descriptive text
lecessarily needed a good deal of revision in view of the great increase
n knowledge during the last seventy years with regard to the
*ccurrence and distribution, relationship and nomenclature of the
arious species. The German names of the individual species have
)een altered to follow those adopted by Karl Neunzig in Fremdlandische
dubenvogel, but the old names are also included. In order to maintain
he character of the book as far as possible, the general introduction
o each plate has been kept in its original form, except for small
orrections. But an innovation has been introduced by the addition
*f short summaries of the condition in captivity of the various groups,
n order to make the book more useful with regard to the keeping and
are of birds. The references in the original text to A. E. Brehm's
refangene Vogel have therefore been omitted. These summaries,
written by an aviculturist of the wide experience of Dr. Steinbacher,

indeed make the book of great value to aviculturists and contain suck
information as the special requirements of the various species, food
to be given, character, tameness, etc.
The systematic list of species given follows that of Peters' Checklis
of the Birds of the World , vol. iii, 1937, with slight modifications in sc
far that the geographical races are not mentioned. As in the origina
edition the names of the species are given in English and French a:
well as in German and Latin.
All the colour plates.which appeared in the first edition are included
but the reproduction does not reach the same standard. An additiona
plate, making a total of 34, by Karl Grossman, has been added in ordei
to include eight species some of which were not known at the time o
the first edition, these are Masked, Black-cheeked, Nyasa, and Fischer':
Lovebirds and Princess of Wales, White-winged, Orange-flanked anc
Amboina King Parrakeets. Unfortunately this plate is poor.
In all, 326 species are dealt with in this edition, and Dr. voi
Boetticher has collaborated with Dr. Steinbacher in the preparatioi
of all the text in order that the present day requirements of scientifii
ornithology should be complied with in every way.
In these days when the ban on the importation of parrots is ii
operation in so many countries and the breeding of these birds ii
captivity becomes ever more important, this book is particular!
welcomed as an incentive and aid to this end. Unfortunately, th
edition is limited, and those desirous of possessing it should not dela'
in procuring a copy.

The first successful breeding of the Horned Screamer, Anhima
ornuta, in captivity in the United States was achieved this year in
he San Diego Zoo, when an egg was hatched on 17th May, 1956.
^ search of the literature has not revealed a previous record of this rare
nember of the screamer family, Anhimidae, reproducing in captivity.
The Horned Screamer is a primitive semi-aquatic bird, characterized

conducive to propagation. Five years of work are represented in the
successful breeding of this species.
The hen laid her first egg 24th December, 1955. Four successive
eggs completed this first clutch. Both birds participated in incubating
the eggs for a period of six days when cold and wet weather discouraged
them and they quit their nest. They were encouraged to continue tc
set but the project was abandoned on the sixth day. Two eggs were
found to be fertile but had died on the sixth day. New nesting materials
were furnished to encourage nesting. Garden snails were fed as a
supplement.
Re-nesting was not observed until the 7th March, 1956, when both
birds again started nest-building. Fifteen days of courtship and
breeding followed and on the 22nd March, 1956, the first egg of the
second clutch was laid. Four more eggs were laid on the 24th, 25th,
26th, and 29th of March. More adverse weather came, rain, hail,
and wind storms.
The nest and eggs as well as the parent birds took a terrific beating
from the elements, and how we worried after all of this work. This
experience upset and disturbed the birds and we decided to incubate
the eggs artificially.
On 4th April we placed the five eggs in an electric incubator and
did a bit of praying. Forty-four days produced a baby chick and it was
worth all of the anxiety and work necessary to hatch it. Two eggs were
infertile and two failed to hatch.
This chick lived for a period of eight days and died because of its
unabsorbed egg yolk.
Of the 247 species of birds we have hatched in the Gardens we
consider this breeding record one of the most important in the history
of the Zoo.

The following notes consist of observations on captive Fire-Finches.
When I first became interested in these birds, I searched through all
available literature to find out what had already been written
concerning their behaviour, hoping to compare my notes with some
standard description. I was surprised to discover that hardly anything
had been recorded about them. It is understandable that this might be
difficult in their native haunts, but the birds have been well known in
captivity for a long time, the Senegal Fire-Finch being bred in
captivity for the first time by the Rev. C . D. C. Farrar in 1898.

C. J. O. HARRISON-SOME FIRE-FINCHES AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR I 29
In the circumstances it seemed worthwhile to record as much as
ossible about the birds of this genus which I was able to keep. It is
ways a little dangerous to draw conclusions from the behaviour of
iptive birds. If too few individuals are studied, there is always the
Dssibility that one may be recording variations of behaviour peculiar
&gt; one particular bird; while the environment is, in any case, artificial,
id the confining presence of a cage or aviary will tend to prevent a
rd from behaving in a completely natural manner.
In spite of these disadvantages, it is still possible to learn much,
have here confined my records largely to calls and postures ; which
*e probably the aspects of behaviour least affected by the environ-
ment.
My observations have been erratic and confined to short periods
the day, usually in the early morning. The notes are, therefore,
xessarily incomplete and sketchy.
The Fire-Finches are small Waxbills of the genus Lagonosticta and
:cur, in one species or another, over most of Africa. These birds,
id those of the closely related genus Estrilda , to which many of the
pical Waxbills belong, are very similar in habit and appearance,
/stematists have found it difficult to decide to which genus some of
ese species should be assigned. I had hoped to discover, while
idying these birds, some peculiarity of behaviour which might help
separate one genus from another.
Of the Fire-Finches normally available to aviculturists in this
untry, the Senegal Fire-Finch ( Lagonosticta senegala) may be regarded
a typical Fire-Finch, while the Lavender Finch ( Lagonosticta
rulescens) is a species about which there is some disagreement. I
is lucky enough to obtain an odd specimen of the Bar-breasted
re-Finch (. Lagonosticta rufopicta ), a species which seems to be imported
&apos; chance in consignments of commoner birds, and I was able to
mpare the three.
In the notes which follow I have, for convenience, dealt with the
negal and Bar-breasted Fire-Finches comparatively, and grouped
Y notes on the Lavender Finch at the end.

little larger than the cock's, more numerous at the sides of the breas
and extending across it. There is a small patch of red just over the ey&lt;
and the eye-rim is silvery-grey. The rump and tail are coloured lik&lt;
those of the cock. The bills of both sexes are red, becoming palei
towards the base.
The Bar-breasted Fire-Finch is a little heavier and cobbier in builc
with a proportionately larger tail. It is dark brown on the back anc
this colour continues up over the crown of the head. The breast i
rose-pink in colour, deepening into red on the throat, ear-coverts, anc
forehead. Most of the breast feathers have tiny white terminal bar:
which appear most numerous towards the sides of the breast. Th&lt;
sexes are described as having similar plumage, but an examination 0
museum skins leads me to believe that the hen may have lighter, more
pink, ear-coverts and throat. The rump and basal half of the tail art
red, the rest of the tail being black. The bill is rather larger than tha
of the Senegal Fire-Finch and is red with a blackish stripe along the
culmen. The eye-rim is silvery-grey in this species.
General Behaviour
The behaviour of the Senegal Fire-Finch is a little difficult tc
describe, since it has no particular peculiarities. It is bold anc
inquisitive and rather sparrow-like in its general demeanour. I
appears to be a ground feeder by preference and perches in ar
orthodox fashion without any tendency towards acrobatics.
The Bar-breasted Fire-Finch differs noticeably in its behaviour. I
has a rather furtive manner and in a cage it seems a very timid bird
When I first bought it I was rather distressed by the alarm which i
showed whenever I approached the cage and, as an experiment, ]
put in a tuft of heather. It immediately darted behind this and a
soon as it was concealed from view, it crouched there on the floor 0
the cage, quite still and silent, until I moved away. Since then it ha
always adopted this and scuttled away into hiding with head low anc
tail cocked high when I approach too near, but it is gaining courag(
and now tends to remain in view and scold loudly. When it escape:
into the room it behaves in similar fashion and, instead of fluttering
at the window, it goes to ground beneath the furniture, crouching
silently on the ground for as long as danger threatens.
In general, it moves in a more crouching posture than does the
Senegal Fire-Finch. Its behaviour suggests that, in the natural state
it is accustomed to haunting fairly thick cover, to which it can retire
at the first threat of danger. Like the preceeding species, it appear
to be principally a ground feeder. For lack of a suitable mate, I pairec
it with a Senegal hen, but neither appears to have modified th(
behaviour of the other.
As regards roosting, I find that, at least where the specimens that j

ossess are concerned, although both species have constructed nests in
ardboard boxes, the Senegal Fire-Finches persist in roosting on a
are perch, while the Bar-breasted appears unhappy unless partially
oncealed and prefers to roost in the nest. Even after the nest had
een constructed, the Senegal hen that was with the latter roosted
1st outside the entrance to the nest while he was within.
&apos; all-notes
In the Senegal Fire-Finch the call-note is a soft and high-pitched
ut fairly melodious " twee " or " dwee " note. I have detected at
mes a slight but distinct difference between the call-notes of cock
nd hen ; that of the cock tending to be a flatter and slightly harsher
all, but I have not been able to assure myself that this is always so.
his note seems to vary considerably, according to the bird's
notional state.
I
The call of the Bar-breasted Fire-Finch is short and sharp, higher
l pitch and more metallic. It is a slightly piercing note, rather
npleasant to the ear.
When this bird was caged alone it had a habit, when flying
ack and forth in its cage, of keeping up a continual succession of
ill-notes. These were quite distinct from one another and of varying
Ltch, but followed in rapid succession all the time that the bird was
1 the move. Such records as exist of the bird in its native habitat
iggest that it habitually associates in small flocks, and it seems possible
tat these continual call-notes may be a form of contact call enabling
Le birds to keep in touch while moving through the vegetation. But,
. view of the difficulties which I have had in identifying the casual,
w-intensity song which seems to occur in these species, I am not
\0x25A0epared to rule out the possibility that it may be of this nature. 1
ive not heard a similar type of continual calling from the Senegal
re-Finches.
mg
The Senegal Fire-Finch has a pleasant and simple little song. It
is a dominant phrase which is loud, clear, and melodious and usually
nsists of three notes with an interrogative inflexion--" dwit-ee-
vee". The song is a series of variations on this phrase, sometimes of
7 o notes only, and each phrase preceeded by two or three low chirps,
here is a low-intensity version of this song which consists simply of
w chirps and single or double notes--" dwee " or " dwee-re
hese are uttered at short intervals and seem quite disconnected,
hen I first heard this type of song I mistook it for a series of rather
tense call-notes.
The most interesting fact about the song is that it appears to be
tered only in the absence of the hen, or, at least, when the hen is
)t visible.

132 C. J. O. HARRISON-SOME FIRE-FINCHES AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR
A cock began to sing immediately after a hen which was with i
had died, and continued to sing frequently until another hen wa
introduced, whereupon it immediately stopped singing. Song wa
not resumed again until a nest had been built. When this had beer
partly lined, the hen would occasionally enter it and, if she stayed ii
it for more than a few seconds while the cock was outside, he woulc
commence to sing, but cease immediately the hen reappeared. I
was, in fact, possible to tell, if one was within earshot, on what occasior
the hen was in the nest and for approximately how long. The cocl
showed a similar tendency to sing when the hen escaped from th(
cage and flew to another part of the room.
The Bar-breasted Fire-Finch has a vigorous and rather exuberan
song which sounds a little harsh and tuneless. It consists of a serie:
of short phrases and tends to continue for long periods. It seems a
first quite formless and composed of an apparently accidental sequence
of high metallic notes and low nasal notes. After a time it become::
apparent that the song consists mostly or entirely of variations on one
or two dominant phrases.
Occasionally the cock would pursue the Senegal hen that was witf
him, adopting a rather upright posture and repeating over and ovei
again a short phrase of three notes. This consisted of the high-pitchec
call-note, followed by a low and very nasal note, and then anothei
of rather higher pitch. This occurred before the two were pairec
and I am still not sure if his intentions were amatory or aggressive
The hen never stopped to find out. This little phrase occasionall)
occurred in his song.
He sang continually when caged alone, but, when the Senegal her
was introduced, song became rather infrequent, though it was nearl)
a month before they became sufficiently tolerant of one another tc
perch side by side. There was a fresh outburst of song when the cocl
began nest-building, though the song output was not nearly so great
as when he was solitary.
His displaying was accompanied by short phrases of the typical
song.
Alarm-notes
The call-notes and songs of the two species are so definitely different
that it comes as a surprise to find that the alarm-notes are so similar
that it is difficult to tell them apart. The alarm call of one species
produces an instant reaction from the other.
The call is an abrupt 44 chuc " note. A slight difference can be
detected when the two species are heard calling together, that of the
Senegal Fire-Finch having a nasal quality and a slightly lower pitch.
This call is accompanied by characteristic movements of the tail.
In the Senegal Fire-Finch it is jerked vigorously to one side or the
other with each note, often being momentarily held bent to one side

Fig. 1). Alternatively, it may be flexed up and down from a horizontal
own to an almost vertical position (Fig. 2). On these occasions the
ail is expanded to about twice its normal width. In both sexes the
ump and tail form a conspicuous black and red pattern which
&gt;ecomes particularly prominent during these movements.
When the Bar-breasted Fire-Finch gives the alarm call, it crouches
on the perch and jerks its slightly raised tail sideways with each note
(Fig. 3). During this movement the tail is half-spread on the side
towards which it is jerked. There appears to be no vertical movement
of the tail in the posturing of this species.

134 C. J- *- HARRISON-SOME FIRE-FINCHES AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR
Nest-call
In the early part of the breeding cycle, the cock Senegal Fire-Finch
often entered the nest and, once inside, proceeded to give a distinctive
call which is very difficult to describe. It seemed to consist of a rapid
series of soft notes which ran together and had a continuous churring
undertone to them. The function of the call appeared to be to attract
the hen into the nest and it was usually effective. I have not heard
this call used at the nest by the Bar-breasted cock, but, when I had
occasion to catch him and greatly alarmed him by doing so, he
crouched in one corner of the cage afterwards and for several minutes
gave what appeared to be his version of this call, though it was shriller
and sharper in tone.
Display
The Senegal cock first displayed to the hen on the day after that
on which she was introduced into the cage and continued to do so
throughout the nest-building period.
The display appears to follow a set pattern. The cock seizes a piece
of grass or a large feather in its bill. This object is held by its tip so
that it projects straight out in front of the bird. This is, incidentally,
the usual method by which it holds the feathers which it carries to
the nest. It flies to a perch with a loud and distinctive whirr of wings
and takes up a rather rigid posture with the breast thrust out and the
head thrown back (Fig. 4). It commences to make short hops in a
</bodyText>

C. J. O. HARRISON-SOME FIRE-FINCHES AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR 135
stiff, jerky fashion. The hen appears to recognize this as a signal and
flies to join the cock, which immediately commences the display.
This consists of a slow bounce on the perch. Holding its head high
and with tail slightly cocked, the cock pushes his body upwards with a
series of vigorous jerks so that it appears to bounce up and down on
the perch. The movement seems to be an alternate straightening and
relaxing of the legs. The upwards thrust is executed with considerable
vigour and, as far as I can make out, the bird's feet appear actually to
leave the perch for a moment and a series of distinct thuds can be
heard when the display occurs on a light perch. There are usually
four or five of these jerks. I have never seen less than three and on
3ne occasion there were seven in succession.
This movement takes place immediately beside the hen and the
ast bob is followed straight away by a deep bow in which the head
md neck are stretched forwards and across in front of the hen, the
lead turning inwards so that the object in the bill is presented just
&gt;elow her breast. This bow is accompanied by a click-like " stip "
lote, which is the only sound made during the display (Fig. 5).
On one occasion, when I was able to view the display more closely,
discovered that, during the first part of the display, the cock's tail
v&apos;as bent towards the hen and held at an angle to the body. This
labit of holding the tail to one side also occurs during the alarm
ailing and at other moments of high emotion and appears to be a
&gt;rimary characteristic in the postures of this species.
The complete display may be repeated several times in succession
nd usually ends when the cock drops the object which he is holding
nd makes a movement towards the hen. Every time that I have
witnessed the display the hen has immediately flown away at this
&gt;oint, but frequently returns a moment later to preen the cock.
When the cock was solitary, he indulged in a form of undirected
isplay. When perching, he would suddenly stretch his neck and bow
awards until the neck was horizontal and the bill pointing down-
wards. This was accompanied by the " stip " note and appeared to

represent the bow of the display. It was, however, directed straight
forwards and not at an angle towards the perch, as it would have been
had a hen been present. There was none of the jauntiness of posture
that occurs in the real display; the bird merely tended to crouch
with feathers a little fluffed.
This behaviour occurred during the same period as the song.
I first saw it when a hen had died. The cock sang frequently
and performed this bowing on a number of occasions. At that
time I had not seen the display and thought that it was suffering
from some obstruction in the throat. This short display ceased, as did
the song, when a new hen was introduced; but it recommenced,
though rather rarely, when the cock began to sing while the hen was
in the nest.
The Bar-breasted Fire-Finch's display took some time to materialize.
Having been unable to pair the cock, I provided him with a Senegal
Fire-Finch hen for company. The hen appeared to be frightened
by the cock and tended to avoid him, and it was not until after nearly
six months that the cock began to nest-build and displayed at last.
His behaviour was just like that of the other Fire-Finches.
He picked up a thin piece of grass such as he was using to construct
the nest and flew to a perch. Here he postured, stretching himself up
rather taller than the Senegal did, with breast feathers a little puffed
out and the tail spread and slightly depressed (Fig. 6). The hen
ignored him and fed on the floor of the cage. He commenced to fly
from perch to perch, backwards and forwards, with tail still spread
and his whole body held at an upward slant. During each short flight
the wings were beaten rapidly with a loud and distinctive whirr,
quite different from the sound of his ordinary flight. When the hen

did perch nearby, he performed a bobbing movement precisely
similar to the bounce of the Senegal Fire-Finch, but did not follow
it up with a bow. This could have been due to the tendency of the
hen to move away immediately; but, since the cock has never shown
any signs of this movement either with, or in the absence of, the hen,
it seems possible that the bow does not occur in the display of this
species.
During the display and in pauses between the flights, he sang short
but vigorous song phrases.

Aggressive (?) Display
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992620647058823" page_id="58073037"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
When I first introduced a new hen into the cage with the Senegal
cock, I witnessed what appeared to be aggressive or defensive posturing.
The cock stood quite still in a very tense attitude. His head feathers
were sleeked down and his head pressed low on his shoulders. His tail
was held to one side, at an angle to the body in a lateral plane, so
that it appeared out of joint. The wing on the side towards which
the tail was bent appeared to be raised slightly and the whole posture
brought into view and emphasized the bright and contrasting red and
black colouration of the rump and tail region. The hen was exploring
the cage, but would return at intervals and circle round the cock
with her tail held in a similar fashion. The cock tended to peck at
the hen at first, but gradually relaxed and within about half an hour
appeared to accept her presence. Within twenty-four hours he had
begun to display.
This posture looked as though it was either aggressive or defensive,
but might possibly have represented some form of recognition display
at the first encounter of a pair, the plumage pattern exposed being
common to both and peculiar to the species.
Nest-building
Two nests were made, one by a Senegal pair and the other by the
Bar-breasted cock and Senegal hen. In the latter case, eggs were
[aid but nothing came of it.
In both cases the nest-building was done by the cock. The hen was
asually present and often entered the nest. In the case of the Senegal
aest, she was inside for a few minutes on several occasions when the
:ock was bringing material for the nest lining and she may have
issisted in lining and shaping the nest cavity. Both nests were con-
itructed in boxes, both were domed, and that of the Senegal Fire-
Finches had a 2^-inch tunnel to the nest cavity from the entrance.
I gave both birds the same choice of natural and artificial materials.
The Senegal cock used fine grass for the outer part of the nest, lining
-his with plant fibre, wool and sisal fibre, and then lining the nest
:avity with feathers. It seemed to use an enormous number of feathers.

1 38 C. J. O. HARRISON-SOME FIRE-FINCHES AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR
and still it asked for more. The feathers that were used were carefully
selected. The cock would pick up one by the tip of the quill so that
it projected straight out in front of him, then rotate it in his bill and
shake it. If it was broken or limp, or if the quill was entangled in the
soft rami of the feather base, it was rejected. The feathers were carried
into the nest one by one.
I put out a whole spectrum of coloured wools to see if there was any
marked preference for a particular colour. I had not reckoned with
the importance of the physical appearance of the material. Two
colours, a grey and a dull green, were just a shade thinner than the
rest, hardly noticeable to the masculine eye, but these were taken
first; while the orange wool, which was no thicker than the rest but
was distinctly fluffier, was completely rejected.
The Bar-breasted Fire-Finch chose much coarser material for the
outside of the nest. This was the dead foliage of Montbretia. Inside
this dead grass and a little wool was used and finally a lining of fine
grass. No feathers were used though many were available. The cock
did pick one up on several occasions but never attempted to carry
one to the nest. The Senegal hen, when she came off the nest, would
pick up a feather and carry it around for a moment or two, though
on only one occasion did I see her take one into the nest. Later on,
when I came to examine the nest, this was the only one which I found.

In this species the plumage of both sexes is almost precisely similar.
The general colouring is ashy-grey, paler on the throat and breast.
There is a black streak from the base of the bill, passing through the
eye and terminating just behind it. The rump, upper and under
tail-coverts and tail are bright scarlet. There are a number of distinct
white spots on the hinder flanks, bordering the scarlet area. These
have been present in all the specimens which I have seen, but appears
to have been overlooked in some plumage descriptions. The bill is
blue-grey with a reddish tint towards the base. There is no coloured
rim to the eye.
Behaviour
This species differs noticeably from the other two in its feeding
habits. Whereas the others were both ground-feeders, the Lavender
Finch is obviously accustomed to feeding in vegetation above the
ground. In contrast to the others, it is as agile as a Tit (Pams sp.)
and is quite at ease when feeding by hanging head downwards. I
have seen one hang by one foot from the top of a wire cage while
removing something from the other foot and it seems to be a regular
practice for it to carry an object to a perch and hold it down with
one foot while it examines it, a feat for which the other Fire-Finches

have shown not the slightest inclination. The other two species can
cling to a vertical wire surface if necessary, but seem unable to take
advantage of a suspended millet spray, while the Lavender Finch will
feed on this rather than pick up seed from the floor of its cage.
In the wilds insects appear to form part of its food and in captivity
it will investigate every crack and cranny in a manner which suggests
that it expects to find insects concealed there.
Call-note
The usual note heard from the birds is a short, shrill " squi ", very
high in pitch. I am not certain whether this note is, in fact, one by
which the birds maintain contact with one another or represents a
state of partial alarm.
This call bears no resemblance to that of the other species. It is an
intense version of the call-note described above, a shrill, explosive
" squeeb ". This species does not jerk its tail vigorously like the other
two. But, when it is alarmed, it adopts a tense, nervous posture with
the feathers tight against the body so that the bird appears rather
elongated. The wing tips are raised slightly and held together over
the back. This exposes the red upper and under tail-coverts and also
the white spots at the rear of the flanks which are not normally visible
(Fig. 7). This conspicuous colouring is emphasized by the bird's
habit, when in this alarmed state, of swinging its whole body from
side to side in a rather jerky fashion. At these times there is a slight
sideways jerk of the tail, but this is not very noticeable.
In the Lavender Finch the tail appears proportionally smaller than
in the other species and, although it is always conspicuous by virtue
of its colour, at no time does it appear to be deliberately moved in a
manner which would emphasize its presence. In actual fact, only the
two central tail feathers are scarlet, but the others, which are of a
brownish colour, are normally concealed by these.

Song
The song of the cock consists simply of a di-syllable call--" see-yu
The first note is fairly high pitched and slides down to a lower, more
melodious one. It is sometimes condensed into what sounds like one
note and, on other occasions, it is long drawn out. As with other
species, the cock usually sings it when the hen is not in view and it is
easily mistaken for a call-note. When this song accompanies the
display, it is repeated rapidly over and over again.
Other Notes
I have not heard the churring nest-call from this species at present,
but, when one bird flies to the nest-box when the other is already
there, there is an outburst of quite musical twittering which sounds as
though it came from both birds.
Fig. 8.
Display
The cock flies to a perch holding a piece of grass in his bill. He
perches very upright with his tail slightly depressed and the feathers
of the rump and tail-coverts fluffed out so that the greatest possible
area of scarlet is exposed (Fig. 8). He then bobs up and down on the
perch in a similar fashion to the two preceding species, accompanying
this by a rapid repetition of his song. This would appear to be all
that there is to it, though, at the time when I witnessed it, the hen
showed no interest.
The white spots on the flanks which are displayed when it is alarmed
do not show during the courtship display, being hidden by the wings,
which are parted to expose the rump feathers.

The displays described here, which are similar in each species, are
&gt;y no means confined to the Fire-Finches. An account by Dr. G. R.
yalker, quoted by Bannerman (1949), of the display of the Orange-
cheeked Waxbill (Estrilda melpoda) suggests that this species has a
&gt;recisely similar display, accompanied by a song which differs from
ts ordinary call-note. Desmond Morris has discussed in detail the
ourtship display of the Cutthroat Finch (Amadina fasciata ), in which a
imilar bobbing movement occurs. He has coined the term " inverted
urtsey " to describe this upward thrusting movement and associates
his type of display with the frontal pattern of this species.
This might be so in the case of the courtship display of the Bar-
&gt;reasted Fire-Finch also. On the occasions on which I have seen it
isplay, the hen has been on the floor of the cage or on another
erch; the white markings, however, tend to be most profuse at the
des of the breast. In the case of the Senegal Fire-Finch, the display
; a lateral one, the cock perching beside the hen and presenting his
de view to her, while, in the case of the Lavender Finch, the most
rominent feature of the display, the fluffed-up tail-coverts, is only
isible from the side or from behind. It would be reasonable to
xpect that, in a genus such as the Fire-Finches, where the prominent
larkings that is to say, the small spots--are on the birds' flanks, the
lurtship display would tend to emphasize this and would, therefore,
md to be lateral rather than frontal.
The prominence of the rump and tail in the various postures would
:em to be a peculiarity of this genus though, until more is known, it
difficult to tell whether or not such markings figure in the postures
id displays of related genera; certainly most of the Estridine Waxbills
ive these parts conspicuously coloured.
I hope to have the opportunity in the future to study other related
&gt;ecies and, until then, I would rather be cautious in my comments
id conclusions. I would welcome any disagreement on my observa-
ms or ideas.
*B&apos; The accompanying sketches are only intended to give some idea
of the birds and their attitudes and may err a little in detail and
proportion.

(.Podargus strigoides )
By H. A. Gerrits
(Manager of the Wassenaar Zoological Gardens, Holland)
To identify the Tawny Frogmouth scientifically we arrive at the
order Podargiformes and descend via the family Podargidae to the
genus Podargus. The habitat of the Tawny Frogmouth, sometimes
called Tawny-shouldered Frogmouth, comprises nearly the whole oi
Australia and the island of Tasmania. When we analyse the scientific
name Podargus strigoides we can at the same time more or less visualize
the bird. Podargus indicates the genus and strigoides from the Greek;
word " strigos " (= owl) and " oides " from eidos (=like). Thefe
Dutch name " uilzwaluw " (= owl-swallow), as the bird is sometimes;
called in our language, probably comes from this Greek derivation.
Before proceeding to a description of this bird I first want to give&apos;i
an impression of the general appearance of the representatives of thcj
genus Podargus and for this I can best quote the really excellenl
description which Mathews gives in his work The Birds of Australia :ji
" Large Podargine birds with large broad bills, long wings, long wedge;
tails, and short legs and feet. The bill is very broad at the base and.
triangular in shape, the gape very large, and the whole bill very:
depressed, the culmen keeled, with a very prominent ridge, and the:
sides flattened. The upper mandible has a prominent hooked tip, theii
edges straight and clean cut, not denticulate ; the under mandible
having the rami narrow and the sides straight, the tip decurved and:
hollowed to fit the hooked tip of the upper mandible ; the interrama
space is fully feathered, bristles along the edges pointing outward :
similar bristles occur along the sides of the gape and cover the nostrils;&apos;
projecting forwards into a tuft as far as the end of the bill. The nostril;;
are completely hidden by bristles and are hollow slits situated near the
base of the bill and overhung by a membranous operculum. The wing; ,
are long and rounded, the fifth primary being longest, the fourth abou
equal to the sixth and much longer than the seventh, which exceeds the
third, the first being little more than half the length of the fifth. The tai:
is wedge shaped, almost as long as the wing, the two middle feather:
attenuately pointed, and the others less pointed. The feet are small
the tarsus less than the middle toe in length. Three broad scutes can b(
counted in front, the back being very finely reticulated. The middle
toe is long, the outer longer than the inner, which is longer than the
hind toe. The claws are long and sharp and mid-toe not pectinated.'|i
The Frogmouth is usually seen singly or in pairs. The bird mostl}

&apos;equents forest-lands and is seldom seen in other regions. It is strictly
octurnal, sleeping in an upright position throughout the day on a
ranch of a tree. When at rest it simulates the bark of the branch so
&apos;ell that it is often difficult to locate, fn daylight the bird is really
nperturbable and according to Gould it may be knocked off a branch
nth sticks or stones. When two birds are sitting together one could
loot one of them without frightening away the other. Such complete
nmobility is hardly imaginable and even in the Louise Hall of the
Vassenaar Zoo, where two specimens were caged and daily thousands
f visitors moved before their aviary, they remained undisturbed on
leir heavy trunk. The immobility of the birds was so striking that in
rder to avoid the repeated questions of the public we had a notice
This bird is alive " fastened to their aviary.
Its call is a low booming or grunting note like " Oom ", repeated
venty or more times. This typical, not very musical, sound droned
ipeatedly through the Hall towards evening. It was remarkable that,
hen one bird started to make this sound, the other would join it
:ter three or four calls. Both birds, however, produced this sound
ith such precise intervals and stopped so simultaneously that it was
1st as if there was only one bird calling.
Both specimens arrived in the Wassenaar Zoo on 7th April, 1955,
aported direct from Australia, and were put into a 24 by 7 by
feet aviary of the Louise Hall. In the beginning we had some
fficulty with the feeding of our Frogmouths. The birds definitely
fused to eat all sorts of insects and beetles and the general condition
^teriorated in such a way that I was very pessimistic about the future,
uring the day the birds maintained the lethargic attitude already
entioned above, which did not even change when we entered their
dary. The birds were continuously in each other's company, sitting
closely together with their feathers so intertwined that on passing
e aviary they gave the impression of one bird with two heads,
owards evening the birds became more lively, started to move about,
ive some sound, and even succeeded in flying with a single slow,
)solutely noiseless wing-beat from one perch to another. However,
ey did not take any food, either during the day or night, which could
sily be checked by keeping exact details of the food provided. After
r o days I therefore started with forced feeding. I made small pellets
nsisting of minced meat mixed with dried insects and beaten
g-yolk. The feeding had, of course, to take place during, the day,
id as soon as we opened the beak and put a pellet at the far end of
e bill the bird swallowed it.
Each bird consumed three to four of these pellets, the size of a grape,
ie after the other, after which they definitely refused to take more. If
J persisted in the feeding they vomited all the pellets taken, so we had
keep to the number the bird took voluntarily. Towards evening we

tried again to feed the birds by hand and they once more accepted
three pellets. This happened for some days in succession and a marked
improvement of their body condition was soon apparent. As we kept
our feeding times to the minute the birds were very soon accustomed to
this routine and became impatient if the feeding was a little later than
usual. They even started to give vent to their feelings with their
disconsolate " Oom oom " for this neglect of their time-table.
We also tried to feed young mice to the Frogmouths and found
that they had such a preference, especially for the very young naked,
pink mice, that they even renounced their imperturbability and took
this food with great appetite. Once when I tried to drop a mouse on
the ground of their aviary between the grass it proved that the seemingly
fast-asleep Frogmouths had been well aware that this delicacy had been
dropped. With an awkward jump the birds landed on the ground, the
little mouse was seized in the strong bill, shaken too and fro with the
obvious view of killing it and breaking its bones, and was swallowed.
Hereafter--actually five days after their arrival--the feeding
problem was solved. The forced feeding was no longer necessary and
both birds took sufficient food voluntarily. They still did not like
insects, but all young mice and meat pellets which we supplied were
duly taken. To be accurate I must add that although the birds ate
a little during the day most of the food was taken at night. Therefore
we supplied fresh food every morning and evening and their condition
became really excellent, so much so that I feared the birds would grow
too fat. In order to prevent this real " aviary fault " I stopped mixing
the egg yolk with the meat pellets.
Before giving a report of the breeding I first want to give a description
of both specimens. To begin with, our Tawny Frogmouths are of
different coloration. In the Podargus strigoides two colour phases
exist, viz. only " grey " males and both " grey " and " red " females.
So a " red " Frogmouth of this genus is always a female whereas a
" grey " one may be a male or a female.
Colour description of the adult male :--
General colour of the upper surface, including the head, back,
wings, and tail, chocolate-brown, mottled and vermiculated with
cream-white, black, and grey, which assume the form of bars on the
flight-quills and tail-feathers, some of the scapulars much paler than
the back ; the white pattern coarser and more profuse on the head,
the black pattern on the head, back, upper wing-coverts, scapulars,
and innermost secondaries take the form of the shaft-lines, many oi
which are globular or pear-shaped at the tips of the feathers, which are
marked with white ; flight-quills blackish-brown marked with white
on the outer webs, some of the outer ones also marked with hazel-brown,
as are also some of the upper wing-coverts, inner webs of flight-quilk
with speckled bars and mottled with brown at the tips ; tail mottled

Now it is well known that the Frogmouth builds its nest in trees or
irubs. The nest itself is an open platform composed of sticks, loosely
ut together and generally placed on a horizontal forked branch of
tree up to 40 feet from the ground. The clutch consists of two or three

eggs, white and rounded, and the breeding season is from August to
December.
In view of the birds' nesting habits the conditions of the aviary of our
Frogmouths hardly gave an opportunity for nest building.
Although the aviary was quite large for birds of the size of the
Frogmouth it lacked the spaciousness which seemed to be required
for building a nest. Moreover, there were no trees or shrubs in the
aviary. Owing to the early season even the vegetation was not
particularly rich and consisted only of grass bordered with small
begonias.
I had never witnessed any mating of the birds during the day and
during the night I did not dare to disturb the other very precious birds
in the Louise Hall, so there was nobody present to observe the
behaviour of the Frogmouths at night. Consequently, we were very
agreeably surprised when we found an egg in the aviary of the Frog-
mouths on 17th May, 1955.
As is usual in the Podargidae the male was sitting on the nest ;
the female sat on a near-by branch and she was as tranquil as on the
preceding days. Her interest in the egg seemed to have gone directly
after the laying of it.
We immediately placed thin twigs in the aviary, hoping that the
birds would build a nest before the second or eventually the third egg
would follow. The place of the " nest "--that is to say so far as it
deserved this name--was along a wire-netting side of the aviary in the
middle of a tuft of begonias which were trodden down by the birds.
Hardly had the nest material been put into the aviary when the male
Frogmouth directly started (in full daylight) to get to work. In an
ingenious way the bird succeeded in shaping the twigs and small
branches into a nest and manoeuvring the egg into it.
I did not assist the bird for fear of disturbing his efforts and the nest
was built around and under the egg without changing the original
position of the " nest-hollow " or any damage to the egg. I do not
know what caused the birds to start this clutch at this time of the year,
which was entirely deviating from their true breeding season, unless
it was that the ideal accommodation and temperature of the Louise
Hall, together with their diet, had quickened their urge to breed.
Plate I shows the male Frogmouth brooding the egg.
I regret that I cannot describe the breeding habits of the Frogmouths
in their natural habitat from my own experience. In the Louise Hall,
however, I only saw the male sitting on the egg. The female came in
the neighbourhood of the nest now and then, but I never saw her
sitting on it. Unfortunately there was no second egg laid and as the
male kept his position on the nest from the very first day, with only a
few hours' interruption for the above-mentioned nest building, I take
it for granted that the actual breeding started on 18th May.

H. A. GERRITS BREEDING RESULTS OF THE TAWNY FROGMOUTH 147
On 16th June, 1955, at 13.00 hours, I observed that the egg was
latched and so deduce that the incubation period is thirty days.
During 17th June I could easily observe the youngster because the
lale had left the nest to eat. A tiny chalk-white little bird lay in the
est and even in this day-old creature the comparatively enormous
eak was already striking. Plate II shows the parent with the vounester
n the third day.
Much to our regret the ieeding of the baby was very unsatisfactory.
)uring the day it got next to nothing and the quantity supplied during
le night was beyond our control, though I suppose it did not get
luch then either.
The large quantities of insects supplied by us were, just as in the
eginning, refused by the parents and neither did they feed them to
le youngster. As soon as the male left the nest the baby raised its
nail head with a wide-open bill hungrily into the air (Plate III),
teanwhile making rocking movements, but most of the time its
forts were in vain.
Now I must draw attention to the fact that in the month of June
Lousands of pupils of the elementary and secondary schools visit the
/assenaar Zoo. These visits are very much encouraged by the
anagement with a view to their cultural importance for youth,
tough under these circumstances we very much regretted the
sturbance of the solitude in the Louise Hall, which was so necessary
r the Frogmouth youngster. For this noisy crowd was undoubtedly
uch to blame for the half-hearted feeding of the youngster by its
irents.
The very insufficient feeding was, of course, not very favourable for
successful growth and in order not to lose the youngster we started
Ming by hand on 22nd June. On 23rd June we continued the feeding
r hand &gt; giving small bits of a few-days'-old mouse, which were
gerly devoured by the baby (Plate IV). After the second day of
iding by hand a marked improvement of its general condition was
able. The growth was more rapid and little feathers even appeared
1 the wings and the downy, white little bird gradually changed into
greyish, stubby creature.
On 24th June I at last saw the female for a considerable time in the
ighbourhood of the nest and I noticed that she fed the youngster.
ie male also fulfilled his feeding duties more seriously and that day
2 baby was sufficiently fed by the parents as not to need any feeding
hand.
The 25th June also passed in accordance with our wishes and when
&apos; perceived that both parents now alternately fed the baby during the
y we were very optimistic about the upbringing of the little Frog-
)uth by its parents. One can therefore imagine our great disappoint-
'nt when, in the course of 28th June, after an extraordinarily noisy

and crowded school visit, we found that the male Frogmouth--
obviously frightened by the numerous children who passed so closely
by its nest (which was disguised by us as much as possible)--had
killed the baby by sitting on it. At this we had to give up hope for the
time being of breeding the Frogmouth in captivity.
Flaving learned much by this experience, however, we changed the
layout of the aviary by planting a medium-high privet hedge at the
front side in order to give the birds a little more privacy and hide them
at least a little from the obtrusive glances of the public should
another attempt at breeding be made.
Indeed, on the 8th July the birds started anew with building a nest
on the same place on the ground. On 13th July the female laid her
first egg of the second clutch and again this was limited to only one egg.
The following day, 14th July, the male started to incubate, but alas,
after some time the egg proved to be clear.
This was the end of the breeding urge of the birds. They did not
visit the nest any more and up till now, March, 1956, they have not
shown any renewed attempts at breeding.

THREE SPECIES OF BUSTARD QUAILS NEW

In the January, 1938, issue of The Foreigner , there appeared an
article written by me on the Quails of Australia. At that time only
three of the eight Australian species of Bustard Quails or Hemipodes
were known in captivity in this State. Of those, the Painted Quad
(Turnix varia) and the Little or Button Quail {T. velox ) are still
relatively common aviary birds here, and have been bred on numerous
occasions, but the Plain Wanderer or Turkey Quail (Pedionomus
torquatus ) has practically disappeared from aviculture in the past
fifteen or twenty years. As far as is known, it has never bred in
captivity, although a pair that I presented to the Adelaide Zoo just
prior to World War II were on the point of doing so when the male
(the only living example that I have seen) was killed by another
occupant of their aviary.
The Red-chested Quail [T. pyrrhothorax ).--In 1953 three birds of
this species came into the possession of Mr. R. W. McKechnie. They
were obtained from a farmer near Murray Bridge who had frequently
obtained young Button Quails during harvesting operations, and who
realized that these birds were somewhat different. They are about
the same size as the Button Quail, but the back is predominantly

Best is a rich rufous colour, particularly bright in the female. A fourth

ingle female without any more eggs having been laid, but fortunately
hree more birds, making two true pairs once again, have recently
*een obtained from the same farmer, and hopes are high for the
oming breeding season. The colour plate of this bird in Mathews'
Hrds of Australia , vol. i, p. 91, does not adequately convey the slaty
olour of the upper surface, and makes the bird look too like its near
elative, the Button Quail.
The Red-backed Quail (T. maculosa) is also called the Black-backed
huail. Two birds of this species were obtained from Queensland in
955 by Mr. A. Phillips, and I was privileged to inspect them. They
^ere identical in size and coloration, and both the owner and I came
0 the conclusion that they were males, as they were not as brightly
oloured as the females depicted in plates available. More recently
iveral more examples of this species, including some undoubted
'males which are larger and extremely brightly coloured, have been
btained by the same aviculturist. This species is about intermediate
1 size between the Painted Quail and the Button Quail, and the
males exhibit a great deal of bright rusty-red colouring. Once
^ain, Mathews' plate (vol. i, p. 79) is not sufficiently highly coloured,
ad may well represent two males. Seth-Smith (. A.M ., 1930, p. 18)
ates that both this and the preceding species have been imported.
The Black-breasted Quail (T. melanogaster ).--This month (March,
^56) I was delighted to see a true pair of this reputedly very rare
ird which had recently come into the possession of Mr. H. J.
utchinson. They are slightly larger than the Painted Quail and the
male is heavily and strikingly marked with black, whereas the male
is very little black on the breast feathers. They are a most handsome
id attractive species, and it is much to be hoped that they will
&quot;eed. Mathews' plate (vol. i, p. 81) is an excellent portrayal of a
male. This bird is recorded as having been exhibited in the collec-
m of Mr. M. Jacobs, of Geelong, Victoria, before the last war.
All the Hemipodes are fascinating aviary birds, and readers are
ferred to the articles by D. Seth-Smith (. A.M ., August, 1905, p. 295)
1 the breeding of T. varia and by the writer ( A.M ., March, 1938,
78) on the breeding of T. velox.

These big, strong birds are fed with grain, seed, all kinds of
vegetable green food and fruit, bread, and twice a week some raw
meat. They are living in aviaries which are planted with small, low
box-trees. It was in these conditions that the Razor-billed Curassow
as well as the Red-breasted Guan bred with good results, whereas
Globose Curassow and Yarrell's Curassow laid eggs which proved
to be infertile.
Last year we had noticed in the group of Razor-billed Curassows
that a couple was forming, which tried to chase the other inhabitants
of the aviary. Of course we did what was required to satisfy our
quarrelsome pair, hoping that the birds, as soon as they were isolated,
would start breeding. We did not have to wait very long, and only
a few days later we found in this cage a large, rough, white egg,
9 cm. long and 6 cm. wide, and weighing i50gr. The second egg
followed two days afterwards. The clutch of the Curassows generally
consists of two eggs, seldom of three. The eggs were laid at random
in the cage, and not, as we had hoped, in the nest built on the ground
of the cage. On close examination it appeared that the eggs had not
been fertilized. We noticed that the birds passed much of their time
on the low box-trees adorning the cage, where they tried to collect
small sprigs and twigs, straw, etc., with the view to building a nest.
The required nesting material was procured, but this proved unsatis-
factory as well, for after some twenty days we found a new series of
eggs spread over the cage. In the meantime, however, the breeding
season was over and winter was approaching.
Needless to say, we were waiting impatiently for the following
breeding-season, when we would profit by the experience acquired
during the previous one.
When Spring was approaching, a small basket was fixed in the box-

trees and it very quickly became clear that this was a very good idea,
because the birds showed great interest in this improvised nest.
However, everything did not yet seem to be to their liking, because a
new series of two eggs was again laid at random in the cage. More
building material was procured ; the nest was extended with leaves
and sprigs, and after sixteen days two new eggs were laid, on the
right place this time, i.e. in the nest. The hen immediately proved
1 very good brooder and accomplished her noble task completely by
aerself, without assistance from the cock. The cock, which spent
much of his time in the close neighbourhood of the nest, and even on
ts border, was an exemplary husband, who left his companion to do
quietly as she pleased, which is not always the case with Gallinacei.
After twenty-two days we found broken egg-shells which had been
.hrown out of the nest, and on the next day we could see two little
leads sticking out of the nest. The hen stayed on the nest till the
lecond day after the young hatched, while the cock did his level
&gt;est to supply hen and young with the required food, which they
.00k greedily from his bill. On the third day the hen left the nest to
eed with the cock on the soft food which we had prepared for the
)aby Gurassows ; in the meantime the latter were impatiently, but
rer y cleverly, climbing all over the little box-tree, till their parents
oined them and fed them.
Four days after hatching we found the fledglings on the ground,
iowever, we do not know whether they were brought there by their
)arents, or had taken the leap at their own risk. As the hen still
&gt;assed the night on the nest, we leaned small branches against the
)ox-tree, so as to enable the young to get back to the nest and to
ind the necessary rest under their mother's wings.
The young Razor-billed Gurassows look like large young pheasants,
ven slightly larger than the young of the Eared Pheasant or the
mpeyan Pheasant. The back is huffish-brown, the breast is light
&gt;rown, whereas the abdomen is almost completely white. The wings
re dark brown with lighter fringes at arms and coverts. The bill is
lightly red-brown at the base ; the remainder is black with a very
ine vertical line of a fight green yellow on the upper part. Further,
he head shows several irregular dark spots, with two dark brown stripes
unning from the base of the bill down to the neck. The feet are
lesh coloured.
The young of the Red-breasted Guan are darker in colour on the
*ack, and have a wide brown band over the cranium, around which
un two very thin white lines. Throat and breast are white, the
bdomen is coloured huffish-brown. Wings and coverts are dark
Town with light buffish-brown coloured fringes. An irregular dark
ar-spot adorns the head. The feet are flesh-coloured. The bill is
ntirely black.

N. P. CAUSTON-HYBRIDIZING WITH DOVES AT LIBERTY
The young of our Red-breasted Guans showed a marked difference
in colour, so that we thought that the colour might possibly be sex-
influenced. But now that the birds are full-grown it appears that this
is not so, as both birds proved to be males.
The young were fed on small seed of all kinds, grass, salad, fruit,
mealworms, mixed food prepared for pheasants, and above all with
baby-biscuits of which they are very fond even now. Only sporadic-
ally they pick their food from the ground ; more than nine-tenths of
the time it is offered them by the parents, with a gentleness and
application which one would not expect from such big birds. Never
in the course of our experience did we see such touching little scenes
of parental love in birds.
Some data were noted for the sake of information : --
On 7th July, 1955, first egg.
On 10th July, 1955, second egg.
On 10th August, 1955, young seen.
On 14th September, 1955, bill entirely red.
On 15th October, 1955, plumage entirely black, although the bird
had only reached half of the height of the parents.
On 25th December, 1955, a slight compression becomes visible at
the root of the upper part of the bill. The birds still take food from the
bill of the parents, but of course much less than in earlier stages.

Your readers might be interested to learn of the following account
of dove hybridizing with liberty birds ; involving cock Barbary and
hen Turtle--the latter being originally encountered as a waif sometime
during the previous season.
After a winter of close confinement in wire front and separate
cages, placed side by side, the birds mentioned were liberated in early
April. This was their first meeting since nursery days in a small
garden aviary together, and they were encouraged not to stray too
far by regular hand feeding (plain Dari). Their immediate reaction
towards each other is not recalled, since these activities took place
some years ago. However, by 23rd April, the first of two eggs was
clearly visible through a typically dovish platform, positioned some
12 feet high in a slender and isolated may tree growing in an area
of garden most used for sitting out (when possible).
In due course, two healthy youngsters appeared, in which the Turtle
predominated, and remained in the vicinity having learned to come
to hand for feeding with the adult birds. Two more eggs--in the

same nest--followed, but these fell through since by now the flimsy
structure had become unsound. Fearing a similar occurrence, the
remains were deliberately destroyed, but ere long building operations
recommenced in the same fork, despite proximity to seeming numerous
and far more secluded breeding sites. Ultimately two more young
birds were successfully raised, this time favouring the Barbary sire.
The whole family, now numbering six, spent the remainder of the
summer around the neighbourhood, coming in for food when required.
However, one early autumn day, the sudden disappearance of Turtle
and progeny doubtless indicated that the urge to migrate had
developed, and so the father became a lone bird.
With the next return of the Turtles that always visited our suburban
garden each year, our attention was aroused by not only a bird
unusually tame, but also the presence of one that was singularly pale
in its plumage. Court was duly paid to these and others too by our
own pet who had survived the winter still at large ! But this season
no material advantage ensued. No proof was actually established
that our birds had returned, none the less we like to think that they
did in view of the foregoing, also that this species is reputed to revisit
the ancestral home.
Before closing I would also mention that during the afore-
mentioned events a widower Diamond Dove was also at liberty.
When the Barbary's back was turned it was amusing to watch how
this tiny mite would materialize upon the scene and pay court to
the hen Turtle, who, apparently approving, judging by her coy
reactions, actually permitted him to mount her ! In fact the stage
had been reached when it was hoped that an even more usual happy
event might have ensued after the second weaning ! However, such
hopes were suddenly dashed following a battle royal between the
two males, when the midget countered most valiantly. But alas, the
odds were against him and before any rescue could be effected, the
Barbary delivered the coup de grace.

The following amusing incident may be of some interest to readers
if only to show that swans, like elephants, have long memories.
Some friends who live near a quiet and picturesque village not far
from Melton Mowbray have a delightful garden through which
flows a small river, only a few yards away from the front of the house.
My friends are bird-lovers and do their best to encourage the wild
birds to make their homes amidst the old gnarled willows and little
streams which intersect part of the garden. However, their efforts

are rather neutralized by the housekeeper's stray cats which like both
feline and human " strays " are apt to be remarkable for their
fecundity ! A few years ago the tables were turned when a couple of
birds arrived which soon put the cats in their proper place--a pair of
breeding Mute Swans.
This was just the location for the business of reproduction, with its
quiet backwaters, tranquil atmosphere, and vast amount of luscious
water weeds upon which the swans fed.
The birds chose a site at the bottom of some shallow steps running
down to the water's edge for their nest.
The swans, shy at first, eventually became very tame as a result
of the encouragement of the housekeeper who fed them on soaked
bread. They, learning to expect this, came to the front door for it
and if the door was closed and no one about, would knock on the
woodwork until someone appeared. If, however, their knocking
remained unanswered they would in time go to the back of the house.
Sometimes if there was no one about and the kitchen door was open
the cob would enter and make himself at home by sitting before the
kitchen fire in the midst of a conglomeration of cats.
In the course of time the eggs hatched, the cygnets grew up and
finally the family moved away, never to return. Some time later my
friends and their housekeeper had gone into Melton Mowbray for
the weekly shopping and on passing by some water, possibly the same
river which flowed by their house, they saw several swans and stopped
to admire them. By this time the swans had recognized them and
gave every indication of pleasure at meeting their old hosts.
The whole swan family left the water and surrounded my friends
who after stroking their heads and talking to them, moved off to
get on with their day's business. The swans were not so eager to say
' w good-bye ", and showed no sign of going back to the river ; instead
they formed into a line behind the party and followed until they came
to the main streets of the town. (What would I have given to have
been there with a camera !) Nothing would deter the birds and they
would have entered shops and business establishments if allowed.
So persistent did they become and so embarrassing was the situation
that my friends had to return to the car park still followed by the
birds, pick up their car, and return the next day, when, needless to say,
they gave the river a wide berth.
Only those who have encountered Mute Swans on dry land com-
prehend their huge size and potential strength. Seen sailing along
on placid waters one doesn't realize how large they really are.

E. CALLEGARI-KEEPING GREBES AND KINGFISHERS IN CAPTIVITY 1 55
ON THE DIFFICULTY OF KEEPING GREBES
AND KINGFISHERS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992296829268293" page_id="58073057"  page_num="155" year="" vol="">
By Eugenio Callegari (Ravenna, Italy)
Few people realize how difficult it is to keep in captivity Grebes,
Kingfishers, and other birds which catch their food in water and are
therefore in close contact with it. I have visited scores of zoos, inter-
viewed experts, and consulted no end of books, but could not find
a satisfactory explanation of the failure to keep the above-mentioned
birds in captivity unless they were given live fish to eat and pure water
to swim in.
Even Dr. and Frau Heinroth in their masterpiece Die Vogel
Mitteleuropas had to cope with this difficulty, and came to the con-
clusion that there was more nutrition in live fish than in dead ones.
In publishing this article I run the risk of being rightly judged con-
ceited, the more so as I could not get further specimens in order to
test the validity of my opinions.
It is well known that Grebes spend their whole lives in water and
only leave it when brooding. I once happened to come across a
group of six or seven Little Grebes (Podiceps r. ruficollis Pallas) standing
on the bank of a canal in a swamp area which, on catching sight of me,
jumped into the water and disappeared. Maybe they had come across
oily patches and had therefore come on land.
If you put a Grebe into a fish pond and feed it on dead fish, in a
few days you will notice that every now and then it comes ashore,
and that day by day the emersions are more numerous and more pro-
longed until, little by little, it avoids water completely. Its plumage
loses its impermeability, its feet get sore, and in a short time it dies.
The same effects are to be seen in Dippers, though I have never
had any personal experience of them. Their feathers, too, lose their
natural impermeability and death follows.
In November, 1953, a fisherman who used to eat grilled Grebes
gave me a Black-necked Grebe (Podiceps n. ?iigricollis ). Wishing to
discover the reason for the above-mentioned failures in keeping the
birds in captivity, I put it in a tub full of water, which I renewed
two or three times a day, and so arranged that the bird could come
out of the water at will. I tried to feed it as naturally as I could afford
on small fish, crustaceans, tenebrio larvae, and seaweeds, which it
systematically refused. I also gave it small feathers of web-footed
birds, as a good quantity of this substance is found in the stomachs
of Grebes, though so far its function is unknown. As in former cases
the bird began to show a dislike for water. I noticed that the dead
fish in contact with the surface of the water gave rise to slight iridescence
produced by a small quantity of greasy substance. I must add that this

phenomenon was most evident in the Clupeidae, less evident in the
Aterinae, and scarcely noticeable in the Cottus species. That might
be the explanation of the bird's dislike for water, however small the
quantity of oil might be.
I sprinkled the bird with talc and put it in a suitable box for a
whole night, firmly persuaded that the talc would remove not only
the greasy substances but the oil gland secretion as well. I plunged
the bird in the water again at shorter intervals so that it might smear
its feathers with its natural oily substance and fed it myself with dead
fish well rinsed in running water. I had hit the mark ! In fact water
became its favourite element. Seizing the fish with its bill it squeezed
it and, rinsing it, often soiled its feathers. I noticed that its lower side
parts and breast were the most sensitive but by sprinkling them with
talc I soon put them right again. The greater care I took in preventing
its feathers coming in contact with the oily substance the longer were
its periods of good health. Afterwards I added some small pieces of
ox heart to its diet ; this is a food which prevents the inconvenience of
greasy secretions, and it got accustomed to it in a short time.
In the spring of 1954, as I had to be away for a while, I left the bird
in charge of my mother, who put it in a vessel and fed it regularly by
hand on ox heart. It would still seize water insects, more as a pastime
than as a staple food. So its condition of health improved greatly
and it assumed its wonderful breeding plumage and was reported to
have uttered cries and assumed attitudes which proved to be mating
manifestations.
In July I looked after it myself. I put it in a fish pond two metres
wide by fifty centimetres long and fifty centimetres deep and only
gave it ox heart thrown into the water ; the fish diet having proved
injurious to its health. In September, back from a trip in Scandinavia,
I found the bird out of the water again and showing a dislike for it,
just as before. I was greatly surprised and came to the conclusion
that ox heart might also secrete oily substances. In fact, after throwing
some tiny bits of ox heart into a basin full of water I noticed, on the
following day, that there were traces of greasy substances on the
surface.
But the remedy was quite easy : a sprinkling of talc on its feathers
for one night and a tiny stream of running water removed the greasy
substance from the surface of the water. In addition, the food trough
was put under the water level not far from the overflow pipe. Ever
since there has been no trouble. Fish diet was resumed, but only
of fish tail above the anal opening. In the second part of my article
I will relate how I arrived at this decision.
My Black-necked Grebe, however, is very docile ; only a few
days after its capture it took food out of my hand, and in a short time
learned to know the step of the persons who fed it and would call out

to them with its characteristic cries. Sometimes it seemed to prefer
fish and at others ox heart. Its plumage is beautiful and wins the
admiration of all who see it. It is a creature far above the average,
which is acknowledged even by those who, moved only by a brutish
atavistic instinct, keep on destroying some of Nature's most wonderful
gems. I must also relate a failure I had with a Little Grebe (Podiceps
r. ruficollis) kindly given to me by Dr. Alfred Brandolini, which died
after twenty days of captivity. I believe the failure was due to my
having put it in a pond where a few days before a Puffin (Fratercula a.
arctica) had died of an infectious disease.
As for Kingfishers (Alcedo atthis ispida L.) I will relate three failures
in keeping them in captivity of which I hope I have discovered the
cause and found out the remedy.
In October, 1954, I happened to catch two Kingfishers and, thinking
of the success I had had with the Grebe, I wanted to try the same
method with them. I put each in a rather small case, one side of
which had been removed and replaced with wire netting, and covered
with some canvas to prevent their flapping. Inside I put a small
basin, supplied with a thin stream of running water, and a few inches
deep I fixed gauze to prevent the bird from knocking its head on the
bottom when it dived. As for food--I put in dead fish, shrimps,
dragon-flies, and grasshoppers, rare delicacies for them. But a few
days later I noticed that one had got wet and during the night it
died. I also noticed that the supply of water had not served its purpose,
for on looking at the surface from a short distance I detected the
iridescent patches produced by greasy substances. But it was not
advisable to feed them entirely on ox heart in order to avoid this, as
I believe that the expulsion of pellets is a physiological necessity for
them.
I was given a third Kingfisher and did my best to find out how to
overcome the above-mentioned difficulty, but after two months they
both died at a few days' interval on account of my negligence. One of
them, sprinkled with talc, got drenched by diving several times to
catch its food and died on the following morning ; the other suffered
the same fate. I put it in a warmed box after each plunge so that its
feathers might dry and get smeared with its natural oil-gland secretions
but it stayed there too long and died.
I had lost all hope of a practical solution of the problem : the
Kingfisher, before swallowing the fish, presses it with its bill and then
knocks it against its perch, squeezing out the greasy substance, which I
suppose is the consequence of the putrefaction phenomenon. The bird
soils its feathers, either directly by splashes of water or indirectly when
preening them with its dirty bill. When I tried to squeeze a fish
between my thumb and forefinger I noticed that the iridescent
phenomena increased when I pressed the abdomen from the head to

the anal back opening, and diminished almost entirely when I pressed
the rest of the body.
Since then I have had no chance of getting a live Kingfisher, but
I suppose that a success might be attained by giving the bird the
chance of plunging into a basin full of running water without touching
the bottom. The perch against which it knocks its food before
swallowing it may perhaps be the cause of its getting dirty. The
outlet should be as large as possible but in order to prevent the food
being washed away a large meshed wire net should be fixed to it.
It is important that this net should not keep back the greasy substances
accumulated on the surface of the water as these were the cause of

Although Maned Geese are by no means a rare species I believe
it is previous to the start of the last war that they were last bred here ;
so an account of their doing so now might interest. I acquired some
wild-caught birds five to six years ago. I had two pairs but shortly
after getting them one male died. During the last two years they
showed interest in the nest-boxes but no eggs were laid. The odd
female was kept away from the remaining pair both by the duck
and drake and it was interesting to see that she, realizing the relation-
ship, tried her best to pair with a male Carolina. This relationship
is very obvious when one compares the young Wood Duck or Carolina
to the young Maned for the first few days after hatching. When this
spring I saw the unpaired Maned going a lot in and out of a nest-box
I was disappointed to see the true pair were taking no interest. The
unpaired duck laid one egg and a week after a second egg. These
I was sure would be infertile, but after keeping them ten days I did
set them and have two well-on young from them. Three weeks
later the female of the true pair laid two eggs in a nest-box where a
Mandarin was laying, causing much fighting. She moved to another,
and fortunately, an untenanted box and laid her third egg ; this was
scraped out by a bantam in search of a nesting site and the egg was
cracked. She, however, laid a fourth egg and then gave up. As
usual, accidents happen and the bantam sitting on her eggs proved
not too good a sitter and I got one egg out of the nest, and, to cut
a long story, I got two more young Maned and all four are doing
well. Incubation was twenty-eight days. For the starting feeds I have
been feeding finely chopped grass and bread and milk, brown bread.
At about a week old they were grazing freely.

The first two Maned, hatched on 15th May, showed flight feathers
and shoulder feathers with flanks and underparts feathered by 10th
June and at this date (16th June), are practically full feathered. Sex
is now visible in that one, the male, shows black on rump whereas the
other, a female, shows grey on rump. The second lot, hatched on

The most notable event of the past two months was the arrival
during May of some birds collected by the Gough Island Scientific
Survey. The consignment, flown from Cape Town, consisted of twelve
Gough Island Coots ( Porphyriornis comeri ), ten Gough Island Buntings
(Rowettia goughensis), both species being new to the Collection, twelve
Rock-hopper Penguins, and six Southern or Antarctic Skuas.
The nearly related Tristan Coot (P. nesiotis ), which is now extinct,
was exhibited in Regent's Park many years ago. The birds would more
properly be called Moorhens, and indeed they are very like our native
Moorhens and have not the lobed toes of the Coot.
The Buntings remind one of the South American Cow-birds in
general appearance. They and the Coots are not at all wild or nervous.
Other arrivals never before exhibited here are a Chinese Koel

Narcissus Flycatchers ( Xanthopygia narcissina) by Dr. K. C. Searle, now
living in Hong Kong.
Mrs. Daphne Seggar brought a number of birds from British
Guiana--two Black-headed Caiques, twelve Guiana Parrotlets,
two Glossy Cow-birds, two Yellow-headed Marsh Birds, eight
Black-throated Cardinals, three Violet Tanagers, and a Great Green
Gacique. She also brought two Maroon Tanagers, presented by the
Paignton Zoological and Botanical Gardens, and sent by Mr. K. Smith,
who was collecting in Guiana at the time.
Two Virginian Cardinals, two Red-crested Cardinals, and two
Superb Tanagers have been presented by Mr. George Newmark. A
Great Condor was received in exchange and another deposited. A

The pair of Snowy Owls are again nesting and the .Great Eagle-
Owls and Spotted Eagle-Owls nested unsuccessfully earlier in ther
spring. I
The King Penguins are incubating an egg and there are several
young Gulls. The Gannets nested but their egg was infertile. There i
are various young pheasants and a family of five Common Peafowl ; |
also four Upland goslings and some Red-crested Pochards.
The Choughs nested again, but failed to hatch their fertile eggs. |
Green-winged Kings that have been at the Parrot House since 1945
have two young ones ; a Swainson's X Red-collared Lorikeet has been
reared and the Quaker Parrakeets are breeding. Violet-necked Lories
nested but did not rear their young. The Satin Bower-birds have built
two nests.

The 1956 breeding season will probably be long remembered by
parrakeet breeders on account of the unprecedented number of
nfertile eggs and young dead in shell. One very prominent breeder
eports that of seventeen Bourke eggs no less than fourteen contained
/oung dead in shell, two were infertile, and only one hatched. Ring-
lecks were just as bad ; nine eggs had young dead in shell, and seven
vere possibly lutinos !

Dr. S. B. Kendall writes of his Plumheads : " I have lost a lovely
)rood (four hatched), five eggs ; and have (nearly) reared but one from
he second pair. I have slaved for them, and during the past three
easons must have had about twenty fertile eggs and have reared two.
rhey go to nest like Barbary Doves and incubate like leeches. They
ire highly fertile and their young bellow for a week or two ; then they
mell horribly ! I believe they need rearing in a warm room--none
)f this good clean air and nice fresh rain nonsense."
The late Duke of Bedford once stated that " They are, in my
*xperience, the hardest of all Parrakeets to rear to healthy maturity ".
Ynd this is indeed confirmed by almost all who have tried to breed
his very lovely parrakeet.

Blue Masked Lovebirds. In the interest of accuracy attention
hould perhaps be drawn to a misapprehension regarding the breeding
)f the first blues in the United States. The progenitors of the multitude
low in the States were not of English origin.
The very first blues bred in captivity were reared at the London
#00 in 1931, and following years. None of these, as far as can be
raced, was ever sent to California. Actually it was hardly necessary,
is the first blue made a very unexpected appearance in 1932 in the
iviaries of R. C. Cross, of Pomona, who eventually bred quite a
lumber.
Mrs. Flowers had blues appear among her normal coloured birds
^arly in 1935 ; and in the same year the late F. H. Rudkin, later to

less than three separate aviaries--all without any aid from him. Inf
fact, he says : " I do not wish to claim any honour as the breeder of
these blue Masked Lovebirds, as they evolved of their own accord."

A contributor to the last number of the Magazine says that in
Australia the vernacular name of Neophema chrysogaster has been varied
from Orange-bellied to Orange-breasted.
It is certainly true that some writers, notably Leach, Barrett, and
Cayley, refer to this Parrakeet as the Orange-breasted--Cayley, how-f
ever, qualifies it by saying " more commonly called Orange-bellied
Grass-Parrot "--but its use appears to be far from general.
Latham first described this Parrakeet as the Orange-bellied Parrot
in 1787, and three years later gave it its present specific name which is,
of course, a compound of two Greek words meaning " gold " and
" belly ". Since then it has almost invariably been known to all
intimately connected with Australian ornithology--especially by such
great authorities as Gould and Mathews--as the Orange-bellied.
Dr. Alan Lendon, one of the two greatest Australian aviculturists, &gt;
calls it the Orange-bellied, with Orange-breasted as a synonym. It is
to be hoped that any aviculturist, thinking in the future to refer to it,
will bear this in mind and follow Dr. Lendon's example in calling it by

Alisterus chloropterus chloropterus (Ramsay)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
Distribution
South-eastern New Guinea west to the Sattelberg on the north
and to the Arao River on the south (Peters).
Narrative
On 30th September, 1878, E. P. Ramsay, Curator of the
Australian Museum, Sydney, read a paper " Contributions to the
Zoology of New Guinea " before the Linnean Society of New South
Wales. Under the name Aprosmictus chloropterus he described as new
a species obtained by Kendal Broadbent in the mountain district,
near the Goldie River, about forty miles from Port Moresby.
Then on 20th March, 1879, R. Bowdler Sharpe (1879) read a
paper " Contributions to the Ornithology of New Guinea " before
the Linnean Society. He described a new parrakeet and named it
Aprosmictus broadbenti after the collector. Very shortly after he
received a copy of Ramsay's paper and consequently his specific
name had to be suppressed. Bowdler Sharpe was justifiably annoyed
because Broadbent's collection had been purchased by the British
Museum with a distinct understanding that it was a direct consign-
ment to England, and that no portion of it had been distributed
elsewhere. But obviously the novelties described by Ramsay were
the result of Broadbent's exertions. As Bowdler Sharpe (1879a)
wrote : " It is very much to be regretted that a new species cannot
come from such an out-of-the-way place as South-eastern New Guinea
without being burdened at once with useless synonyms."

Tring, was heard of this parrakeet until 18th January, 1909, when
the Zoological Society of London purchased three Aprosmictus
chloropterus. These were, of course, listed as new to the Collection.
Seth-Smith (1926) tells us that they were brought by Walter
Goodfellow and that they lived for several years in the Regent's Park
Gardens.
When, on 19th November, 1925, Walter Goodfellow arrived in
London from a collecting expedition to New Guinea, he brought j
with him many superb birds. There was a single Green-winged King, j
said to be the first living example to reach Europe--this bird went *
to Foxwarren Park and nothing further is known about it. One
rather wonders why Goodfellow did not remember, or professed not
to remember, his importation of some seventeen years previous :
also why no one else appears to have recalled the fact.
Then, in July, 1933, F. W. Shaw Mayer brought back five. Three
of these went to Primley Hill and two to Foxwarren Park. Mr.
Ezra's birds were believed to be a pair but the " hen " eventually
turned out to be a cock. The elder bird died in 1936 and the
younger in 1953. Kenneth Smith kindly informs me that one of
the Primley birds is still alive.
Shaw Mayer brought two birds in 1936 that went to Foxwarren
Park, and six in 1937 for the late Duke of Bedford. The former are
the late Mr. Ezra's famous breeding pair about which more anon.
The Duke's birds were an adult cock and five immature birds--four
of these moulted out cocks. The following year the sixth, mated to
the adult cock, showed some interest in her nest but got no further,
probably because the cock was not as much in breeding condition as
he might have been.
In 1945, after more than nine years, Mr. Ezra's pair went to nest
and succeeded in rearing a young one. In answer to my inquiry,
A. P. Shearing, the Curator of Birds at Foxwarren Park, kindly
informed me that the following results had been obtained :--
^45, one young reared.
1951, one young reared.
1953, one young reared.
1954, two young reared.
1955, one young reared.
All six young are still alive. The 1945 bird is a male and is paired
to the 1951 female, but they have not made any attempt to nest.
When the late Mr. Ezra's collection was dispersed in November, 1 955 ?
all eight were secured by Sir Crawford McCullagh, Bart., and went
to his aviaries at Belfast Lough, Northern Ireland.
The only other successes are to the credit of the London Zoo :

nest ; x 953) one hatched but disappeared when well-feathered ;
1954, one reared ; 1955, two reared. This breeding pair was
purchased in May, 1945, from J. Spedan Lewis, and had, I believe,
originally been in the possession of the Duke of Bedford.
In 1949 E. N. T. Vane bred hybrids, Green-winged King x King
Parrakeet ( Alisterus scapularis scapularis ), one reared of two hatched.
In 1950 they were double-brooded ; two reared in the first nest and
two in the second--one of the latter, however, soon died as the result
of injuries to feet and beak sustained in an attack by a pair of
Amazons in an adjoining flight. The male parent originated from
the Duke of Bedford. Several of these hybrids are still alive--two
with Sir Crawford McCullagh, Bart., and one with Mrs. G. T. Clark.
The Duke of Bedford (1929) suggests that one reason this magnificent
parrakeet is so rare in aviculture is the fact that native trappers
stupidly mistake it for a Lory and allow it no seed or grain, with the
result that it quickly dies of malnutrition ".

By Nicholas Gravem, Jr. (Mill Valley, California, U.S.A.)
I read with great interest Mr. D. M. Reid-Henry's article (Avi-
xjltural Magazine, Vol. 62, No. 3) differentiating between the two
Scarlet Tanagers : Piranga erythromelas of eastern North America and
Ramphocelus brasilius of eastern South America.
I fear that the author is not entirely correct in assuming that the
najority of American aviculturists well understand this situation ;
lowever (and fortunately), there should be no confusion in the minds
)f those who have now read his concise explanation. It seems that
lone of the more popular non-technical books on the subject treat
his distinction between the two Scarlet Tanagers, and generally omit
entirely our North American bird. Probably the prevalence, as aviary

birds, of Ramphocelus brasilius is due to the strict protection enjoyed
by our northern Scarlet Tanager ; the few of the latter reaching
Europe probably being trapped south of our border.
We have, over here, several others of the Family Thraupidae that
I believe are little known as aviary birds in Britain, or elsewhere, for
that matter. Like P. erythromelas, they are strictly protected (and
from American aviculturists, generally speaking, as well). We have
no scheme with regard to keeping close-rung native birds, as in i
Great Britain, but governmental permit may in some cases be
obtained.
A member of this family that I personally believe vies with the
beauty of the Scarlet is our Western Tanager (P. ludoviciana ). This j
bird is basically yellow with a crimson face ; black back, wings, and
tail ; yellow wing-bars ; lighter grey bill and darker grey feet. It is
slightly smaller than our Scarlet. Adult hens are greenish-yellow
above and drab yellow below. This attractive Tanager is generally
found in our more mountainous regions, except during its spring and
autumn migration when it occurs throughout the lowlands. It has
been accused by orchardists of damaging fruit, particularly cherries,
and sometimes goes by the name of 4 4 Fruit-eating Finch ". Their
nesting habits are similar to those of the Scarlet ; a rather loose nest
on a horizontal limb, and three to five bluish eggs spotted with light
reddish-brown.
The Cooper's Summer Tanager (P. rubra cooperi), another bird of
the western U.S.A., is predominantly red ; not the vivid scarlet as
in P. erythromelas and Ramphocelus brasilius , but more of a rose-red.
However, this rose-red extends over the entire plumage with the
exception of the wings which appear to be somewhat washed with
brown. Hens, as can be expected, are drab olive-yellow. Unlike the
Western Tanager, the Cooper's prefers the willows of the river-
bottoms and is quite abundant along our Colorado River during
spring and summer.
A bird very similar to the above is the Hepatic Tanager ( P.Jlava
hepatica), but, as the name suggests, it is of a darker shade of red,
particularly on the back. It also has a brownish ear-patch and quite
dark bill ; otherwise very similar to P. rubra cooperi. This Tanager
is at home in the higher forests.
I am sure these three species would be admirable aviary inmates,
and it is unfortunate that they are not available to aviculturists.
The same sentiments apply to a host of other birds native to western
U.S.A. For example, in his excellent book Foreign Bird Keeping , Mr.
Boosey praises the merits of our Rose-breasted Grosbeak of the east.
This brings to mind our western U.S.A. counterpart of the Rose-
breasted, the Black-headed Grosbeak (#amelodia melanocephala ). In
this bird the rose of the breast is replaced by cinnamon ; and it is

an equally fine songster. I particularly think of this handsome
Grosbeak at this time of year because of its prevalence about our
summerhouse. I am sure this bird would make a wonderful aviary
subject.
American aviarists cannot, generally, keep native birds such as
these ; but, fortunately, some of us live in neighbourhoods where it
is possible to observe them in nature. But, does this satisfy the desire
to try to breed them in captivity under controlled conditions ?

(.Hesperiphona vespertina)
By C. M. Payne (Barford, Warwick, England)
Many years ago, prior to the last war, I was privileged to see
exhibited at one of the many cage-bird shows, a pair of Evening
Grosbeaks in excellent condition and simply glowing with health.
They took first prize and, if I remember rightly, also the special prize
for the best foreign hardbill. The memory stayed quite fresh with me,
despite the upheaval of the war and the passage of time which none
can avoid, and I was therefore particularly overjoyed when, during
1954, two pairs were presented to me by a very good friend. As they
arrived in the autumn I put the birds into my bird room for the rest of
that year. Early in 1955 the two hen birds died and this caused me
much sorrow, primarily because I thought replacements would be
difficult, but also because I hate to lose any bird. I cannot quite
ignore my conscience, which reminds me from time to time that I have
robbed a living jewel of its freedom and must therefore give it the very
best service I can. However, at about that time, my friend Raymond
Sawyer had an odd hen which he gladly exchanged for one of my
remaining cocks. This was a propitious exchange because during the
present season this hen has nested and produced two young Grosbeaks
which are now, at the time of writing, self-supporting. Here is the
story of probably the first successful breeding of the Evening Grosbeak
in this country.
The pair of Evening Grosbeaks were housed in an outside aviary,
about 15 feet square, with a shelter of reasonable size attached.
This aviary contains the remains of a large apple tree and other
shrubs, in particular Lonicera nitida, a very useful evergreen shrub,
which is liked by many birds for nesting purposes. I did not anticipate
that the Evening Grosbeaks would take to this shrub, as all the
authorities which I could consult made it plain that in the wild state
Evening Grosbeaks nest in the very tops of tall trees, and in any event
not less than 20 feet from the ground. How many aviculturists can

offer that height ? However, I am a firm believer that if one can only
get the birds into a super-fit condition they will attempt to breed and
will accustom themselves to strange surroundings.
About this time a pair of Wattled Starlings were busy constructing a
bulky nest in a box bush ; or rather they were constructing and
demolishing their bulky nest in alternate weeks. I was rather antici-
pating that the Starlings would be the first to lay, but one day during
the tour of inspection of the aviaries I saw the hen Grosbeak extract a ?
twig from the Starlings' nest and fly swiftly about the aviary with it in
her beak. I watched intently hoping that I should find a partly
constructed nest in some part of the aviary ; but the bird did not &lt;
deposit the twig in any spot, she merely allowed it, in due course, to
fall to the ground where it was instantly seized by the Starlings, who
once again added it to their nest. By the way, Wattled Starlings take .
the place of scavengers, and add every particle of green food and
discarded stalks to their nest, in fact they spring-clean the aviary each
and every day. For some days I watched the hen Grosbeak repeat the
performance with a bent or twig, but no attempt was made to make a
nest. I then searched the garden for an old Blackbird's nest which I
placed, for want of a better place, in a Lonicera nitida bush about
15 inches from the ground. I intended later to construct a wire-
netting shelf camouflaged with brush-wood in the highest part of the
aviary, but almost before my back was turned th# hen Grosbeak had
inspected the nest and, apparently deciding that here was the answer
to her housing problem, added a bent or two and next day laid an egg, ;
which was followed by three others on consecutive days. The eggs
were similar to the eggs of a Greenfinch although much larger, a pale
clear ground with minute spots on the larger end. I did not actually
measure the eggs for fear of disturbing the birds. The hen sat steadily
after the first egg, and after twelve days the first young was seen,
followed by three others on consecutive days. The last youngster was
of course much smaller than the other three and was soon lost. The
three survivors grew well on the mealworms and gentles which were
(after passing through a thorough mastication) liberally fed by the hen.
For the first few days no other food was fed so far as I could tell.
Later, as the young birds grew, a quantity of hemp in particular,
together with sunflower, soaked oats, and mixed seeds were taken and
also a little sweet apple and groundsel. The old Blackbird's nest was
hard put to it to contain the youngsters as they grew, and as they
grew so did my fears that the youngsters would be precipitously
discharged on to the ground, so preventive methods of propping the
nest were resorted to. This proved quite successful and the nest held.
On the 20th day of July, just eighteen days after hatching, the first
young Evening Grosbeak left the parental home.
The Evening Grosbeak is one of the largest of the sparrows, with a

large typical grosbeak bill. In size it is somewhat smaller than the
English Hawfinch. It is covered in broad masses of lemon yellow, with
black wings, tail and crown, the secondaries and tertiaries are largely
white. The cock has a bright yellow bar on the forehead. The female
Evening Grosbeak is much duller with no bright yellow on the forehead,
and with an ashy wash all over ; the secondaries and tertiaries are not
wholly white as in the cock, but broken.
These birds are found in Central and Western North America, where
they breed in the northern coniferous forests from Western Ontario,
westward, and along the mountains to New Mexico. In winter they
migrate south. The nest is made of small twigs and lined with bark,
hair, and rootlets. As the favourite food of the Evening Grosbeak in
North America is the seed of the Manitoba maple, left hanging on the
trees, it is considered to do little harm to agriculture and in fact may do
quite a bit of good. It is also extremely fond of the seeds from old
rotten apples which are also left hanging on the trees through the
winter.
The three young birds which left the nest were, I believe, two cocks
and one hen. The one hen had a rather crippled foot and was from the
first unable to perch properly, whereas the other two were both strong
on the wing and were able to perch without difficulty. A few days after
leaving the nest, my aviary attendant, Mr. Beck, found the crippled bird
dead and we were left with the two young cocks. They continued to
prosper and after four weeks were seen to be eating both the soaked
and hard seeds. It is interesting to note that as soon as they became
self-supporting, gentles and mealworms were ignored, although they
did take a little fruit.
The birds on leaving the nest were coloured like the hen, but the
two young fully reared have wings like the cock ; hence the sup-
position that they are young cock birds. In fact one, the elder, already
has a patch or two of lemon yellow on the sides and thighs.
A surprising fact was the absolute tameness both in the nest and since
flying, quite unlike the nervousness shown by similar British finches.
During the courtship the hen bird, as I have already stated, carried
twigs and bents about the aviary followed closely by the cock bird,
with crest erect and wings down. Mating was not witnessed. The cock
bird took little interest in the nest although a few quiet sibilant
chirrupings were given if one approached the nest too closely. He did
not share the incubation, which was solely the responsibility of the hen,
as in fact was the rearing. The cock only fed the hen on occasions with
a morsel of chewed up mealworm.
The old birds are not aggressive in any way and the family are living
at peace with the other occupants of the aviary. The Starlings before
referred to, a pair of Barraband's Parakeets, an odd Plum-head cock
bird, and three Red-faced Lovebirds.

By E. B. Tanner (Finchley, London, England)
(Formerly Overseer of Birds, London Zoo)
When considering ways of keeping small birds (or large ones, and
mammals, too), I do think it helps to include a certain amount of
psychology in one's calculations. Not, of course, the kind of
psychology we hear so much about these days in its application to the
human miscreant, which is really anything but psychology. I mean
an attempt to see things as far as possible through the eyes and senses
of the bird with its instinct gained by age-old experience, and to
identify oneself with it. Perhaps I shall not be very successful in
trying to explain this point of view, but I will do my best. There are,
of course, many opinions as to the methods to adopt in keeping
birds at their best, and quite a number of them are correct, judging
by their owner's experience, with regard to condition and longevity.
Others, again, seem to flourish although there really seems to be no
reason why they should, under well-meant but misdirected manage-
ment ; for instance, a parrot which had helped itself at will from
a box of liqueur chocolates over a period of years. Perhaps, however,
such instances are on a par with the long-lived Okapi at the London
Zoo. The late Mr. R. I. Pocock, in conversation ascribed its longevity
to the fact that probably its digestive organs had undergone a trans-
formation enabling it to thrive for a long time on the very different
diet it was able to receive here, compared with its natural one.
However, it would be very risky deliberately to try out such an
experiment on small birds without a fatality occurring, and one can
only look upon these unusual instances as fortunate accidents. One
parallel can be seen though amongst birds which are normally
rather difficult, as one occasionally has one which breaks all records
for longevity for such a species, although treated no differently to the
others. Reverting to the question of birds' welfare in general---
suppose we take the vexed question of heating. At times I have been
told about very small birds, Cordon-bleus, for instance, hopping
about in the snow, very well and happy, although I have not received
subsequent information. If one considers, though, how near these

small birds, compared to larger ones, have their vital organs to the
surface, it would seem that these examples must be lucky survivors.
Large birds, of course, from whatever part of the world they come,
especially if thickly feathered, such as touracous and pigeons, are
usually much more able to withstand hard weather, but even they
have years added to their lives if they are supplied with some comfort.
By heat I do not mean what is known as coddling, 85 or 90 degrees,
although this can be very useful in cases of illness, providing one
takes care gradually to accustom the birds to a lower temperature
afterwards. I suggest a moderate heat, such as one in which one could
sit and read in comfort without extra clothing. Feathers are excellent
non-conductors of heat, but they are not very thick on a small bird,
and too often we forget that it cannot don extra clothing such as
pullovers and overcoats, as we can. I have often heard people, wrapped
up to the eyes, entering the Bird House on a cold day remark upon
the heat. They, of course, forget that they are dressed to suit the
outside temperature, and that it is the contrast which they feel, but
that the birds are in the same covering the whole twenty-four hours.
We know many wild birds, apart from tropical forms, have to
encounter extreme cold at times, but that is a period in which they
are at a low ebb, and not the time of boundless health and procreation
which follows with the fine weather. Necessary as it is in a virgin
country, for which Nature's scheme was evolved, we hardly want our
individual birds to be subjected to rigours to reduce their surplus
numbers, and therefore I suggest that attempts to harden them
unduly can only lead to increased fatalities. They may withstand
spartan treatment for quite a time, but there always comes a day when,
for some reason, they are below par and then, in common parlance,
" they have had it." There is no possibility of saving them. It is
strange the effect a sharp frost will have upon many small birds,
even in a heated room. When one can sense a frost outside, without
actually feeling cold, it would seem that this can be enough to cause
chill in the abdomen, one of the birds' worst enemies. I have noticed
many cases of enteritis after such a period. Indeed, I think the
greater proportion of enteritis cases are due to cold upsetting the
digestive organs, rather than a food poisoning. We know the effect
of chill upon us, so how much more likely it is to upset a small creature
which is so allergic to the smell of paint or to fumes of any kind.
I would stress again that I mean a comfortable warmth, say 65 degrees,
for small birds, especially at night when they are still, not a hot-house
temperature all the time.
It is always rather unaccountable to me, why a given temperature
seems so much warmer in a small compartment than in a large one.
Maybe absence of moving air in the smaller place accounts for it,
but I should certainly plump for a higher temperature, rather than

a lower in a large compartment, to obtain the same result. In Nature,
we know, nothing approaches or grasps a bird except with evil intent, :
and we can hardly expect it to accept us, not knowing our intentions, !
against all its deeply inherited and justified instincts. That is why
a strange bird is not stupid when it dashes about so madly upon a
person's approach. It is not terribly worried either, but just following
its natural instinct to get away from a possible danger. If one can
observe it unseen, a difficult thing to do on account of its acute eyesight,
it will usually be found that it ceases its frantic endeavours. At the
same time, it may still do its utmost to get out, not because it is
frantically beating its wings against its prison bars, as some well
meaning people will have it. It does not realize such a thing as a
cage, but is trying to get through the vegetation, as it appears to it.
There is hardly such a thing as an impenetrable bush to the wild
creatures--on the contrary, the dense vegetation is often their salvation,
as it receives them and ensures their escape. So the wires to the bird
appear like a bush it cannot get through, and its main idea is to
take no chances. This escape into dense bush habit is inherent in
many mammals such as antelopes, and also struthious birds. If
allowed into a new paddock without previous preparation, it sometimes
happens that they dash headlong into the opposite fence expecting to
go through it, with serious injuries, if not worse, resulting. To return
to the bird--in a cage, of course, the distance is too short for sufficient
speed to be attained to do much harm, although abrasions on the
face may be caused. If a bird is very wild, it may be necessary to
have hessian fixed temporarily, where it mainly concehtrates, or even
to have a cage with wooden bars, merely temporarily of course,
which are less damaging than wires. There is, however, a much
greater risk when releasing the bird into a strange aviary, or for the
first time, on account of the speed attained. It is therefore advisable
to place the cage inside the shelter of the aviary for a few days, in
order that it can get acquainted with the sight of the other denizens
(and they with it) and with its surroundings. Then if its cage
door is left open, it will come out quietly. This acquaintance will
also help to prevent the other birds ganging up on a total stranger.
I here is another angle to this, many insectivorous birds after being
in a cage where they feel at home and safe take it badly upon being
released, and wall mope in a corner, with perhaps fatal results if left
too long. Shamas come to my mind as being very prone to this,
which can be avoided by the method mentioned.
Apropos of a bird's acute eyesight, already referred to, I think
1. H. White, in his book The Goshawk , summed it up admirably.
While trying to stalk his bird, which had got away, he said he
noticed one thing about the birds he encountered, especially crows,
hawks, and rooks, and that was if you saw a bird you could be sure

it had seen you first. Another instance of their keen vision is seen
:n a small bird nesting in a hedge. Although a long hedge of dense
vegetation looks just the same to one throughout its length, it will fly
headlong and parallel to it, before unerringly plunging into the small
^ap leading to its nest. To revert to the Shama. If one looks at
it from its point--it is in a home, where it feels safe, and where food
and water are at hand. It is suddenly turned into a large hostile
(to it) area, with perhaps other hostile occupants, does not know
where food and water are, and is too dejected to search. It gets
into what it feels is a quiet spot and lies low, consequently suffers
from strangeness and exposure if left, and can starve in the midst of
plenty. The remedy is to accustom it first. It often becomes necessary
to catch a bird from an aviary for some reason. One has to use a net,
upsetting all the other inmates and perhaps causing injuries to them
by collisions with the wire. As we have already discussed the aversion
a bird has to being caught, I would suggest the following. Suppose
we put a trap cage, with a string to close the door as it becomes
necessary, installed as a permanent feature of the aviary, and put the
food tins inside always. As they would all go in and out freely, the
bird wanted could be caught with the minimum of disturbance, as it
would then only be necessary to take it out of the cage. This would
aid in inspiring trust in the other inmates, as birds have extraordinary
memories for many things, especially those which involve fright or
discomfort. 1 have not found that noise itself worries them to any
extent. A sudden bang will make them jump, but they recover almost
at once. It cdn be appreciated that a bird which stopped to brood
over any sudden happening would soon fall a victim to a nearby
predator. Of course, it is possible that a long-legged bird could slip
and break its leg on a smooth surface in the same circumstances. The
bombs during the war only scared the inmates of the Bird House
temporarily ; one reason for this may be their familiarity with
thunder, which can be terrifying, in tropical zones especially, though
this does not seem to apply to some larger mammals, such as elephants.
They, however, do not have the same need to recover quickly. As for
ordinary noises, birds seem to like them to a certain extent, as they
join in the din. I have often heard a bird which normally never
sang, thoroughly enjoying itself when the House was full with a
Bank Holiday crowd. I doubt whether noise interferes with breeding
to any extent, if they are accustomed to it, but a sudden commotion
when they are living in quiet surroundings is another matter, and
is likely to cause abandonment of the nest. This is more unlikely if
the young are hatched, even if unwise. Predatory birds being
uncertain breeders, it was rather surprising that we bred Great Eagle-
Owls at the Zoo on at least three occasions, with lorries thundering
away a few yards ofT on the outside road ; this shows how a bird can

become used to ordinary noises. Of course, with predatory birds and
some others, such as Blue Pies, there is always a chance that the
parents will devour the young, whether kept in secluded surroundings I
or not, and I feel inclined to put this down to the parents craving for
freshly caught food, particularly when they have young as they
would be on the hunt incessantly. Naturally one would expect to
find birds bred in quiet aviaries very much wilder than those used
to plenty of movement. This applies to small birds in general, and '
one has a much greater certainty of taming them if they are kept where r
the owner or his family spend their time, rather than in a room &apos;
where they only visit occasionally. In the same way, birds kept in
a range of aviaries will be tamer and steadier if they can see a visitor
approaching before he, to all intents and purposes, suddenly bursts
through a hole in the wall. The latter causes a panic, all the birds
making a frantic dash to get outside. A wire panelled door and
another panel let in the dividing wall are indicated here.
Birds, mammals too, are extremely averse to any change of routine.
Unlike us, they do not hanker after anything different, whether food,
cage, or surroundings. I do not mean a sameness of diet, as naturally
we try to give them as much variety as possible. But give them
something new and they turn their " noses " up at it. I have known a
large mixed aviary refuse to touch wasp grubs and other insects,
merely because they were new. Yet they would go crazy over meal-
worms. Our fruit-eating birds would not entertain dates as a food.
Then came the war, and for a time we were able to get war-damaged
raisins and sultanas. This supply came to an end with the depletion
of these damaged stocks, but fortunately damaged dates became
available. These they absolutely refused to look at, until eventually,
with no other alternative, they began to eat them. In time, again,
other fruits became possible, when they, one and all, refused to eat
anything but dates for some time. We almost always find an escaped
bird strives might and main to get back into its cage or aviary if it
happens accidentally to fly out of the door, that is unless it happens
to lose itself behind trees or houses in the first headlong dash. I imagine
that we, in a hostile world, would similarly prefer to remain where
we felt safe and had food and shelter, remembering that the unknown
does hold dangers for the bird, unlike us, for whom it merely spells
adventure. In some instances it may happen that a bird does not
recognize the external appearance of its cage, but if it does that is
where it makes for. Amongst many instances of this I think one
concerning a Common Partridge is interesting. A lock on an outside
aviary door failed to catch and amongst Laughing Kingfishers, a
Wandering Tree-Pie, etc., which all returned subsequently, the
Partridge was wandering about on the path outside. I got one of the
keepers to go round the other way to try to walk it back but, as luck

would have it, a child burst out of the door of the house just as it got
near. Up it rocketed, over reservoirs, fences, and trees into Regent's
Park. It was war-time, the Park was closed, and the grass a foot or
more high. I had written it off, when three mornings afterwards
a gardener found it waiting outside the aviary door. He opened
the door and in went the Partridge, settling down quite happily.
One can perhaps understand a passerine bird, upon taking stock of
its position, flying to an adjacent point near its aviary, but for a ground
bird, hiding in long grass, never flying except by necessity, it is
certainly extraordinary that it should find its way back to a door
opening in a lobby. It had to come back over high double fences and
other obstacles.
But after all a bird at liberty has its sad moments as well as those
when it is on top of the world. In northern climes there are exposure
and starvation during winter besides enemies. These last are an
enormous factor in the tropics, in fact, so many creatures prey on small
birds that one can wonder how they maintain their numbers. I believe
it has been estimated that the average life of our Robin is thirteen months.
They have to be on the qui live unceasingly from aloft and below, and only
their capacity for quick recovery prevents life being a sorry business.
Survival is not easy, but there can be no regrets on our part. It is
Nature's way, and they are attuned to it, but we can understand how
they appreciate the safety of a cage or aviary where food is at hand
within a short time of accustoming themselves.
To revert to birds' dislike of change, how often can one see a bird
hating to be put into a new cage. I have seen birds in cages so
dilapidated that they were tied together with pieces of string, and when
in sheer desperation a new cage was provided, the occupant moped
for two or three weeks. New perches or feeding tins will have a
similar effect, the occupant avoiding them as long as he possibly can.
My own birds at home sometimes keep swearing until we have to
find out what is the matter. It may be a newspaper which has got
under a chair unseen by us and on its being restored to its proper
place all is peace again. When I was a boy we had an ordinary Java
Sparrow at home, but cc he wasn&apos;t ordinary ". He was one of those birds
who preferred a dilapidated cage held together by will power only,
and refused to take to a new one for a long time. He was a really
sweet singer, the only one I have ever heard which really sang nicely,
and I have had hundreds under my care since. He was kept on a
windowsill in my bedroom and it was usual to hear him having a
bath at one or two o'clock in the morning in the dark, when one
was just able to distinguish his cage in the window.
One example of a bird's extreme dislike to any alteration is, I think,
shown by the following case of a British Reed Warbler in the Bird
House. When it first arrived, thinking to give it a very faint imitation

of its natural surroundings, I put a twig in its cage, which had an
offshoot at approximately right angles. This was fixed in its cage
with the offshoot pointing upwards, the idea being that it could
assume the same position as if it were clinging to an upright reed.
After this twig had been in its cage for a long time, some two or
three years, and had received repeated cleanings, it seemed to be
time for it to have a new one. As an exact replica was not available,
mainly the reason why it had the other one so long, and anyway it
did not seem to matter a great deal (events proved me wrong), an
ordinary twig was substituted. Upon this it immediately went offj
colour and sat in a corner all day with his eyes closed. It looked
as if it were going to die, and I really think it would have done so.j
The next morning it looked worse, but an idea occurred to me--hadi
the removal of his twig any connection with its loss of health ? So we i
searched the rubbish for the old twig which, fortunately, for some
unusual reason had not yet been removed. It was soon found, cleaned,
and restored to its cage with the result that within half an hour it was
its usual self again and there was no further sign of illness, either
then or later. Undoubtedly his illness and recovery were due only:
to the removal and replacement of this important (to him) twig.
We sometimes wonder why a pair of birds kept together do not get
on well, and perhaps one bullies the other--very often the bully is
the hen, in Bullfinches, for instance, and Birds of Paradise. We can
understand this better if we reflect how even a breeding pair of wild
birds are seldom together, one or the other being a field or more
away, a great deal of the time. No doubt a human married couple
would have their differences if they were confined to one room all
the time but, not having the primitive nature of the bird, they would
do their best to arrange matters amicably, at least we hope they would.
With our bird, on the other hand, obeying Nature's behest, it just
attacks the object of its dislike all out. At liberty, of course, with all
wild creatures tragedy is averted by the weaker ones, whether
physically or in spirit, making good their escape. As our bird cannot
do this, one or the other must be removed. It is no use to try keeping
them together in the expectation that they will become used to one
another. Even if the bully does not actually peck the other one and
just drives it off the perch or feeding tin, it will take all the spirit out
of it and you may find it dead, without any injury being inflicted,
even in an aviary. In the same way in which we hear of a primitive
native fading and dying because he has had a curse put upon him,
so can a bird die at will, so to speak, if it is not perfectly happy. For
this reason, there can be no cruelty involved in keeping birds in
captivity, as long as they are fed and attended properly. If they
bath, feed, sing, and keep their plumage in order, they are perfectly
happy, besides living much longer. There are no two ways about

his, as if they are not happy they just fade and die for no other reason,
ust as a plant does if grown in uncongenial soil. A curious thing
ibout birds (and doubtless mammals) is that if one dies for some
reason you are quite aware of or for no reason at all, one can almost
nvariably find it has a complaint--which could have caused death,
ilthough it had shown no signs of such. The explanation for this,
[ take it, is that few birds, like us in that respect, are perfectly healthy,
rhis drawback, however, does not prevent them living out their
normal life if all else is well and it is a normal provision of Nature,
especially in the tropics. In certain instances, also, it is possible for
a. bird which is known to be a young one beyond any shadow of
doubt, to show every sign of senility when a post-mortem is undertaken
after death. &lt;
Well, I have mentioned these things to try and show how tempera-
mental our birds are, and in addition to knowledge of the proper
care of them, which we can obtain from one of the many books written
to give advice in bird-keeping, it helps a very great deal if we, as
I said at first, try to identify ourselves with them and put ourselves
in their place. Domestic livestock, whether mammal or bird, adapts
itself to all sorts of artificial treatment but, with the wild birds
especially, it helps enormously towards success if we pay regard to
their necessarily highly strung constitutions and to the conditions
when they are at their best, imitating nature at her kindliest mood
as far as we can.

(.Hypochera chalybeata Mull.) IN CAPTIVIT\
By Holger Poulsen (Copenhagen, Denmark)
The Senegal Combassou is a very handsome and interesting little
bird, but, nevertheless, it is not common in bird collections, at least
not here in Denmark. This is obviously due to the general assumption
that it does not breed in captivity, and that it disturbs other breeding
birds. Little is known about the breeding biology of this bird, but
it is strongly suspected of being parasitic. Below are given some
examples from the literature of the subject. In his study of the
breeding parasitism of the Viduinae Neunzig (1929) states that
observations of parasitism in Hypochera chalybeata have not been made
in the wild, and according to some aviculturists " briitet Hypochera
nicht selbst Roberts (1949) writes about Hypochera : . . . nests
of this and other species have been described, but it is probably
parasitic like other related species and genera. . . Hoesch (1939)
points out that there is strong evidence that Hypochera is parasitic

as no records of nests exist, but on the other hand the fosterers are
not known. Bannerman (1953) says about Hypochera chalybeata :
" There has been much speculation as to whether or not the Senegal
Combassou is parasitic on other species, especially on Lagonosticta
sene gala, the Fire Finch, but actual proof is not yet forthcoming."
Chapin (1954) writes : " We still have much to learn about the
combassous. Surely their eggs are always laid in the nests oi
Lagonosticta, Estrilda, and perhaps some allied members of that
same group." The Morels (1955) are the only ornithologists whc
have made actual observations of the breeding habits of the Senegal
Combassou. They write : " . . . nous avons jamais trouve de nid
d &apos;Hypochera, ni jamais observe d'adultes en train de construire, bien
que cette espece soit tres abondante dans notre region. Par contre,
nous avons remarque a plusieurs reprises que la femelle d &apos;Hypochera;
visitait souvent les sites de nidification favoris des Lagonosticta.
Nous avons enfin remarque a plusieurs reprises la presence d'un
jeune Hypochera parmi des groupes de jeunes Lagonosticta qui
continuent a suivre leur parent male apres la sortie au nid, cette
jeune Veuve Combassou etait alors nourrie par le Lagonosticta
adulte, comme les jeune de cette espece."
An indirect proof of the breeding parasitism of the Combassou is
pointed out by Neunzig (1929). He found that the mouth markings
of the nestling of the Combassou are very similar to those of the
nestling of Lagonosticta senegala, and the juvenile plumage of the twc
species in question are also very similar to each other. This, he
thinks, indicates an adaptation of the mouth markings and juvenile
plumage in the Senegal Combassou to those of the foster-species.
The Morels (1955) also mention the striking similarity of the palate
markings in the nestlings of the two species.
Records of breeding in captivity are few. Russ (cited in Butler.
1899) says that he had a pair of Combassous where the hen laid
eggs in the nest of a pair of Senegal Fire Finches which neithei
proceeded to egg laying nor brooding of the alien eggs. Later the
hen Combassou restored an old Zebra Finch nest and laid five eggs
which were incubated by the female alone in twelve days, whilst the
male defended the nest and pursued all other birds. Neunzig (1921}
says that the Combassou has bred a few times in captivity, and that
a pair used an old nest of a Zebra Finch which they repaired
Probably he refers to the same case of breeding as mentioned by
Butler. Boyd (cited in Hopkinson, 1926) says that he had one young
bird reared by Cordon-bleus ( Uraeginthus bengalus), and that the
Cordon-bleu female and the Combassou female both laid eggs ir
the same nest, but the latter took no further interest.
Therefore it may interest both aviculturists and ornithologists tha&apos;
we have had two breeding results in recent years. Two differeni

aviculturists were so lucky as each to have a pair of Senegal
Combassous breeding in their aviaries. In the first case in 1951
a pair parasitized the Fire Finch (Lagonosticta sene gala) (A. R. Nielsen,
1951) ; in the other case a pair built their own nest in the summer
of 1955 (K. Nielsen, 1955).
In the first case a pair of Combassous were placed together with
other small birds in an aviary (5 X 2.70 X 2.5 m.) planted with elder
and spruce and grass on the ground. When the male got his brilliant
plumage he made his courtship flight, hovering in front of the female,
or over her, on flapping wings with his body feathers slightly ruffled,
and twittering ; but it did the same to Bengalese and Indian Silver-
bills. The female showed interest in the nests of different birds
and was seen on several occasions sitting in the nest of a pair of
Senegal Fire Finches that had laid eggs, and which were not frightened
by her presence. One day four eggs were found outside the nest,
but the Fire Finch was still brooding. Some days later the luminous
spots of the gape wattles of the young ones were seen in the nest
when the pair had left the nest while feeding. They brought food
for the nestlings, viz. fresh ants' pupae, water-fleas, and sprouting
seed and after some time two young ones left the nest. They
resembled the Combassous, not the Fire Finches, and when they
grew older they scratched with their feet with a shuffling motion
when seeking for seeds on the ground. The Fire Finches cared for
the two young Combassous for three weeks after they had left the
nest. Then they stopped feeding them, and one of the young
birds perished, whereas the other was independent and was doing
well.
In the other case of Combassous breeding in captivity a pair was
put in an aviary (4 X 1.75 X 2 m.) together with other small birds,
among them a single male Senegal Fire Finch and two males and
a female Cordon-bleu. At the beginning of July the male Combassou
was collecting nest material, viz. grass and coconut fibres. The nest
was placed high up in the aviary in a thick shrubbery of twigs ; it
was a loosely-constructed domed nest of the waxbill type with the
entrance pointing obliquely downwards. It was not observed whether
both mates shared the brooding duties, but it was noticed that both
male and female were in the nest during the night. Both male and
female took part in feeding the young in the nest ; the female always
flew into the nest first, the male followed her, and he always appeared
again first. Perhaps only the female fed the young and the male
only fed the female.
At the beginning of August two young ones left the nest and were
now exclusively fed by the male, who also guarded the young very
intensively against other birds, which he pursued. The female no
longer showed interest in them. The young sometimes gaped and

begged for food from other birds, such as Zebra Finches and Cordon-
bleus, and now and then they succeeded in getting some. During
the first days after the young had left the nest they still slept in it
together with their parents, during the night.
The observations made by the Morels and the first of the twc
breeding results in captivity actually show that the Combassou ij
parasitic. The second breeding record shows further that the)
Combassou is also able to build its own nest, but the problem stil j
remains to be solved whether it regularly has two methods o
breeding or only occasionally builds its own nest, e.g. under the
abnormal conditions of captivity. At least, no records exist of nest:
of Hypochera in the wild, but the interesting fact has been establishec
that nest-building, incubation, and rearing behaviour are not lacking
in Hypochera chalybeata. Another question is if it regularly parasitize&apos;
on birds other than the Fire Finch. Neunzig (1929) has impliec
that each of the Viduinae has its particular waxbill species host, bui
this is by no means definitely established. Thus, Vidua macroura i:
known to parasitize at least nine species of Estrilda and Lagonostictc
and two weavers, Coliuspasser ardens and Amauresthes fringilloides, while
there is some evidence that Vidua regia lays its eggs in the nest o
a warbler, Prinia Jlavicans (Friedmann, 1950). Neunzig was wel
justified in his belief that the Fire Finch is the chief fosterer o
Hypochera chalybeata , but other species besides the usual host may also
play a part.
Three members of the Viduinae are definitely known to be nes
parasites. Thus, as already mentioned, the Pin-tailed Whydal
(Vidua macroura) chiefly parasitizes Estrilda waxbills and their allies
the Paradise Whydah ( Vidua paradisrea) parasitizes the Green-wingec
Pytilia ( Pytilia melba ) and other Pytilias, and the Shaft-tailed Whydal
(Vidua regia), the Violet-eared Waxbill ( Granatina granatina) anc
probably others. The other species of Vidua will presumably ir
time be found to be parasitic as well.
Neunzig (1929) pointed out the close similarity in palate marking:
and gape wattles between the nestlings of different whydahs and theii
hosts, and that the whydahs owe the possession of these ornament:
wholly to mimicry of their fosterers. Delacour and Edmond Blanc
(1934) are more cautious and assert that there is not enough evidence
of this theory. Hoesch (1939) and Chapin (1954) disagree witl
Neunzig and take the more balanced view that the whydahs art
closely related to the Estrildinae, and that their young had simila:

REARING THE HOODED MERGANSER

The Hooded Merganser of North America, Mergus cucullatus, is one
of the most beautiful of the waterfowl. The species has been
recorded as an accidental visitor perhaps a half-dozen times from Western
Europe and the British Isles. Only a little larger than the Smew,
the adult male in breeding or winter plumage can be immediately
recognized by the white breast with sickle-shaped black bar on the
side (like a Wood Duck or Mandarin), the vermiculated brown
flanks, the white on the scapulars and lesser wing-coverts, black back,
and the striking white, black-edged fan-shaped crest which in life is
often nervously raised and lowered like a signal flag.
The Hooded Merganser, unlike the Smew, had never been kept
successfully in captivity until Mr. Charles A. Pilling, of Seattle,
Washington, found a female, crippled during the autumn hunting
season, in 1950. This bird, starting on natural food found in his
ponds, soon settled down and finally started eating grain and pellets
(compressed tablets of mash) like the other wildfowl.
In the spring of 1953 Mr- Pilling's female laid eggs and Mr. Pilling
made every effort to secure a male. On Christmas Day in 1953 he
brought home a male that had been shot in the hip and with a
badly broken wing. By keeping him in a small wire cage, with

a bantam hen for company (they became friends in about a week).
Mr. Pilling was able to keep the wild male alive and at last to make
him tame. Eventually he was brought into the kitchen, still in his
cage, and made friends with Mrs. Pilling, the four Pilling children,
and the dog and family cat.
The bird was force fed on a mixture of one-third fresh fish, one-
third dog food, and one-third meal containing wheat germ oil,
brewer's yeast, and powdered skim milk, among other things. The
forced feeding lasted ninety-four days before the drake began to eat
by himself. He was bathed daily.
After he began to feed naturally he was given an airing on a small
pond each day for a week, after which he gradually began to resume
a more normal life. However, he still prefers to feed from the hand
and soon taught the female to do so as well.
The spring of 1954 the male went into moult, perhaps due to his
artificial environment during the winter. The female Hooded
Merganser mated with a drake Wood Duck, laid, and the eggs were
fertile but the young died in the shell just before hatching. Mr.
Pilling reports that the young looked like young Wood Duck, but
unfortunately none was preserved. The spring of 1955 the two
Hooded Mergansers were segregated and the female laid ten eggs.
The eggs took thirty and a half days to hatch, from 12 noon on
29th April to out of the shells on the morning of 29th May.
The surviving ducklings were force fed every hour during daylight
for the first three days and every two hours for the next three days.
The birds started eating mealworms on the fifth day. After dipping
the mealworms in a mash the young soon started eating a mixture
of egg, mash, and chopped lettuce. From then on they were fed
stripped raw beef heart, but after two weeks they fed mostly on
a regular commercial game bird mash. Mr. Pilling remarks that in
fact the old birds as well as the young really prefer this feed, Purina
" Game Bird Startina ", to anything else, " except my wife's home-
made stone-ground whole-wheat bread. They will drop everything
for this, and so will I," he relates.
By mid-August Mr. Pilling had six young reared out of nine fertile
eggs. At six months one of the young wrenched its neck in an
aperture in the wire fence and subsequently died. The remaining
five developed into two males and three females.
This spring, 1956, Mr. Pilling has hatched twelve young Hooded
Mergansers so far, an avicultural triumph. Truly he is to be
congratulated for the first keeping and rearing of these enchanting
little ducks.

There are five species of North American forest thrushes com-
monly assigned to the genus Hylocichla. They range in size from about
that of a Nightingale to that of a Song Thrush. They are all brown
above, pale below, and with dark spotting on the breast. All are
true thrushes (not chats), and there is evidence that the Wood Thrush
H. mustelina, the largest species, is not especially closely related to the
others and may, in fact, be best considered in Turdus (Dilger, 1956a).
The remaining four are closely related to the South and Central
American Nightingale-Thrushes of the genus Catharus and are best
considered congeneric with them (Dilger, ibid.).
With the exception of the Wood Thrush they are very similar in
appearance and are moderately difficult to distinguish by sight in the
field. Comparatively minor differences serve as distinguishing char-
acters. The Veery or Wilson's Thrush, Catharus fuscescens, is a uniform
tawny brown above and white below with a buffy wash on the breast
which has a few indistinct spots. The Hermit Thrush, C. guttatus ,
is rather heavily spotted on the breast and with a reddish-brown
tail which is characteristically raised and lowered. The Olive-backed
Thrush, C. ustulatus , and the Grey-cheeked Thrush, C. minimus , are
very similar in appearance but the former has a conspicuous buffy
eye ring and cheeks whilst the latter has these areas decidedly greyish.
The Wood Thrush, besides being the largest, is stockier in appearance
with very extensive and very dark spotting on the underparts. The
head is also more reddish than the rest of the dorsum.
The ranges of these species overlap extensively and in view of their
similar appearances and similar ecological requirements questions
arise concerning their reproductive and ecological isolating
mechanisms. Unlike their appearances, their voices are quite dis-
similar and investigations have shown that vocalizations provide the
chief sign stimuli upon which correct mating choices depend (Dilger,
r 95 ^^)- Rough segregation as to habitat and adaptive differences
in limb and bill proportions correlated with different feeding niches
provide ample ecological isolation (Dilger, 1956c).
A number of individuals representing these species were kept in
captivity in conjunction with some of the investigations carried out
on their hostile behaviour as this relates to their reproductive isolating
mechanisms. All five have been in my possession at one time or another,
but I can say this only as a technicality as I had but one Grey-cheeked
Thrush and it, a wild-caught adult, died a few hours after capture !

All of the others, with the exception of one Wood Thrush, were
obtained from the nest and hand-raised. These nestlings were easily
reared on a diet of chopped earthworms with a gradually increasing
proportion of canned dog food. It is usually difficult to get enough
insects to feed normally insectivorous birds and this canned dog food
proved to be a good substitute. Since all of these species consume
quantities of small fruits these were frequently provided. Blueberries
cherries, grapes, raspberries, blackberries, currants, and mulberries
were readily available and eagerly consumed during the summer and
autumn. Raisins, chopped apple, and other commercially available
fruits were utilized during the winter. Dried raisins are eaten but the
birds prefer them soaked. The Hermit Thrush which I have at present
has learned to soak them in his water dish if they are proffered dried.
This was learned by chance as he initially used to drop them in the
water by accident and subsequently retrieved them well soaked. He
now does this quite deliberately. The staple of canned dog food had
some disadvantages. First, it spoils rapidly when not under refrigera-
tion and hence a close watch must be kept on the amount on hand in
the cages. Secondly, although the birds appeared in good condition
their droppings were somewhat loose and of a brownish colour. A
commercially prepared dry dog meal (Kasco) was next used. This,
of course, does not spoil when dry but the droppings, though firmer,
were still brownish. At present I am using Spratt's Mockingbird
Food as a staple. This is given with a small admixture of grated carrot
and hard boiled whole egg. My birds are thriving on this and their
droppings are firm and sharply black and white. Small fruits are
still given upon occasion and also mealworms and whatever other
live food that comes to hand. They can handle small earthworms
but large ones must be cut into pieces for them. These are taken with
relish. Small strips of lean raw beef are also consumed eagerly. A
vitamin supplement is given, especially in the winter. This has been
a water soluble commercially available all-purpose vitamin mixture
known as ABIDEC. Zymadrops would also be suitable.
The birds are housed in glass-fronted, half-inch hardware cloth-
covered cages which measure 36 inches long by 20 inches deep by
20 inches high. Two are housed quite comfortably in such a cage
and three seem not too many, but new combinations of individuals
have to be watched carefully for several days in order to be sure that
none is being persecuted by the others. Food and water are kept
in finger bowls and the cage floors are covered with newspapers.
All are great bathers. Water in wide shallow pans is provided for
this purpose every other day or so. Bathing behaviour is manifested
as soon as the birds are old enough to leave the nest. The bathing
motions are innate but the fact that they have to be performed in
the water has to be learned. This has been borne out by observations

on the Wood Thrush, Veery, Hermit Thrush, Olive-backed Thrush,
and the American Robin, Turdus migratorius . The first bathing motions
are frequently carried out on the dry cage-bottom right after the
bird has dipped its bill in the bathing pan. In these cases the bathing
motions are as typical and intense as real bathing and are usually
followed by the shaking and preening that occur after true bathing,
which suggests that the entire sequence tends to be followed through
once the performance is initiated. Adult birds occasionally perform
this " dry bathing " if the bathing drive is high and the bathing pan is
pre-empted by another bird. In these cases rather intense intention
movements to bathe usually precede the actual bathing movements.
In these cases, too, the bird typically performs the entire sequence
including the drying and preening movements. It is ludicrous to
see such a bird after " bathing " fly heavily, as if soaking wet, to a
perch and commence the lengthy series of shakes and preens that
normally follow a bath. This " dry bathing " has been reported for a
number of species (see Morgan and Tyrrell in Armstrong, 1947, 120).
This may be an example of vacuum activity or leerlaufreaktion as
described by Lorenz (1937), in which a behavioural sequence is released
by the presence of a normally inadequate (suboptimal) stimulus
providing the internal drive for that particular behaviour is high
enough. The Hermit Thrush which I have at present frequently
exhibits this type of behaviour by " flycatching ". He will suddenly
appear to be intently following some moving object in the air with his
eyes, sally out, " capture " it with a loud bill snap and then return
to the starting point where his " prey " is beaten on the perch for
a moment before being obviously " swallowed ".
I have made some observations on the behaviour of my present
Olive-backed Thrush before it fledged which may be of some interest.
As is the case with other young birds with which I have had experience
it would present a fecal sac at each feeding. The actual feeding,
however, is not necessary to stimulate this presentation as it would do
so even if the food was accidentally dropped, or if feeding was merely
pretended. Apparently just the stimulus of the presentation is enough
to start the peristaltic wave along its large intestine which presumably
causes the fecal sac to travel to the cloaca. The hind portion of
the body is sharply elevated before the fecal sac appears and possibly
pressure of the nest rim against the lower belly serves as a releaser
for the actual expulsion of the sac, as this bird would scuttle rapidly
backward until the cage wires came into contact with its rear and then
the sac would be expelled, usually falling outside the cage. This
behavioural pattern would be of considerable sanitary value in the wild
in case the parent neglected to seize the proffered sac. The stubby
tail is waggled vigorously from side to side immediately preceding
the defecation. Unfortunately, 1 failed to keep similar records of my

other birds when they were young but my recollection is that a similar I
pattern was followed. The fledglings typically do not defecate during
the night and the evacuation following the first feeding of the morning
is unusually voluminous. When the young reach the stage of fledging |
the faeces are no longer presented in a sac and the " backing " behaviour 1
abruptly disappeared at this time in the Olive-backed Thrush
mentioned above.

extended ; lower left : head retracted ; lower right : adult position
with bill and face under scapulars.
It was interesting to follow the ontogeny of the typical sleeping
postures (Fig. i). Up until about eight days old the young of all of
these species sleep with their heads limply extended in front of them
or over the backs of their siblings ; soon, however, they begin to sleep
with the neck retracted and the bill pointing upward at an angle of
about 45 degrees. The extended neck posture is seen less frequently
until the birds finally sleep in the retracted posture only. At about
ten days of age the head is sometimes turned over the shoulder and the
bill and face thrust under the scapular feathers in the adult sleeping
position. This gradually becomes the final sleeping posture adopted
although adults sometimes doze during the day in the retracted
posture. I could discover no preference in individual birds for either
the right or left side when sleeping in the adult manner, but these
species are difficult to surprise while asleep once they are fledged.

<bodyText confidence="0.999052" page_id="58073095"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
The bill and face are thrust under the scapulars, which are raised a bit,
with a short, wriggling movement strongly reminiscent of the
" tremble-shove " movement of nest-building birds working a
twig into the nest.
Pellets composed of compacted indigestible remains of food are
typically cast by all of these species much after the fashion of owls and
hawks. Pellet casting in passerine birds has not received much atten-
tion in the literature (see Tucker, 1944). The size of the indigestible
remains seem to have some bearing on whether they will be voided
orally or in the faeces. Small seeds such as those found in raspberries
or strawberries are voided with the faeces but larger items such as
cherry stones are voided orally. The compacted larger fragments of
insect chitin are voided orally but the tiny earthworm setae and very
small fragments of insect chitin are found in the faeces.
Sunbathing is done whenever the opportunity presents itself. Sun-
light is not necessary to elicit the response but any warm, bright
light source such as a desk lamp will do. The bird stiffly orients its
body at right angles to the source of heat and light, fluffs out its
feathers, usually spreads the uppermost wing or raises it, spreads the
tail and then remains in this position for some minutes at a time.
The eye nearest the light source remains wide open and the bill is
typically held parted. These species begin this behaviour at an early
age ; all of my birds doing it as soon as they fledged. Sunbathing often
follows water bathing if the proper stimuli are present at the time. Heat
seems to be a more important stimulus than light, although light
must be present (they will not sunbathe to a hot iron nor to an ultra-
violet lamp which gives off little heat). An infra-red lamp, however,
stimulates a response quite readily.
My Olive-backed Thrush rather inexpertly captured crawling
insects for the first time when it was eighteen days old and had been
fledged for about four days. It would not pick up inert food material
until it was twenty-four days old. From this day on it fed itself but
would " beg " for food when approached for several days more.
From the date of fledging flying insects caused this bird to follow them
with an eye and to make intention movements to sally after them.
Young of these species when near fledging indulge in much preening,
shaking, stretching, and other comfort movements. The rapidly
feathering wings are often whirred rapidly, almost lifting the youngsters.
In the nest the wings are most frequently stretched by bringing both
over the back while partly folded. Later the commonest stretching
movement is the usual stretching of a wing and a leg on the same
side. A common movement seen in fledglings and younger birds
is a thrusting upward and forward with the extended neck while
the head is rapidly flirted in a rolling manner from side to side. This
reminds me very strongly of the preliminary head shaking in Mallards.

I have not seen adults do it. The legs may be stretched simultaneously
by the bird straightening both legs to their fullest extent while standing
or perched. A typical full-stretching sequence in these forms is to
first stretch both wings over the back, then stretch a wing and a leg
on one side, followed by a similar movement on the other, and lastly
stretching both legs at once as described above (Fig. 2). The jaws
may be stretched and this is distinguished from the somewhat similar
threat gaping by the context of the action and by the fact that the jaws

are shut quickly in stretching. Bill wiping is done in the typical
passerine fashion, first on one side and then on the other. Ilf the
bill is particularly dirty more than one wipe on the same side of the
perch may be performed before changing over. Scratching the head
with a foot is, of course, done in the usual over-the-wing fashion of
passerines.
These are rather " volatile " birds in regard to overt expressions of
minor fluctuations in the relative and actual strengths of the attack

md escape drives. These slight fluctuations are reflected in varying
degrees of crest-raising (attack) and slimming of the plumage (escape)
md are displayed almost constantly during their daily activities,
rhe reddish crest of the Wood Thrush is a particularly sensitive
' barometer " in this regard.
Fortunately, I have had little trouble with illness in my birds.
Last fall, however, they all contracted some serious respiratory ailment
md were literally at the point of death. I luckily hit upon a cure
md all survived. In the United States and Canada, at least, various
mtibiotics for veterinary use may be bought without a doctor's prescrip-
ion. There is a terramycin preparation available in collapsible metal
:ubes which have long nozzles and are designed for the treatment of
mastitis in cows. In desperation I bought a tube of this material
md gave each of my birds a squirt of terramycin orally. The long
lozzle facilitates this and one only has to be careful to get the end of
the nozzle beyond the glottis so as not to drown the patient. Recovery
was amazingly rapid. All of the birds appeared perfectly normal three
tiours after treatment !
I plan to make more cages and perhaps an outdoor aviary to house
more birds which will enable me to continue my behavioural observa-
tions on a larger scale. I hope to breed some of them. The Wood
rhrush has been bred several times in captivity (e.g. Ivor, 1952),
md the Hermit Thrush has been bred by Amsler, 1927.

By A. F. Moody (Lilford, Northants, England)
Curlew (JVumenius arquata).
Of all waders kept during half a century of bird-keeping few have
appealed to me more or have been more interesting than the common
Curlew ; well-remembered objects of curiosity of my boyhood days
when to see or hear an example on rare occasions passing high over the
Yorkshire wolds was the sole extent of my acquaintance with this wild
and wary species. Since then it was a red-letter day indeed first to
visit their breeding ground upon the heather-clad moors ; as was
also the case when I first viewed them in numbers at their winter
quarters in certain estuaries around our coast. Be these facts and
reminiscences as they may, I have always in after years found a charm
and pleasure in overcoming the extreme wildness and wariness of
these graceful creatures and in having them around. Large and
hardy enough to be almost cat- and rat-proof, they can be kept in
walled-in gardens or in large enclosures where they show to the best
advantage and find much of their own living. Ten or twelve years
is no unusual period for an adult wild-caught Curlew to live in semi-
captivity. During every moment of that time, be they standing
sentinel-like with the various waterfowl, probing the soft earth with
their long bill for earthworms, or adroitly capturing insects from the
tall grasses with the same apparently unsuitable member, they are
ever interesting, and their wild and weird cry renders them additionally
attractive.
Food .--As to artificial food, newly caught Curlews when started in
a small pen, take readily to fragments of fish, liver, or lean meat,
f hey will also eat scalded biscuit meal or broken dog biscuit. This
is a reserve food we get them on to by supplying in a shallow pan of
water with the meat, etc. Once thoroughly on to artificial food
they never forget it, and even when given access to several acres of
ground will eventually, like domestic poultry, on being whistled
come racing from a distance, morning and evening, to receive a few
pieces of food thrown from the hand.
Hardiness .--As before stated, Curlews are comparatively hardy, but
during deep snow or prolonged frost, it is kinder to confine them to a
shed where unfrozen food and water can be kept before them.
Oystercatcher [Hcematopus ostralegus).
Hardy and equally long-lived as the Curlew, we have found the
Oystercatcher very adaptable to aviary or enclosure life. Ornamental
and rather busy little birds, they are almost continually on the move,

preference for running around the water's edge, frequently uttering
their well-known metallic chip or call, or occasionally pushing their
long red bill into some other bird's face.
They also, as might be expected, favoured bare, stony ground, and
made their very slight rubbings or nests upon the gravelled walks, a
circumstance which, owing to unavoidable disturbance, prevented
any successful breeding.
Treatment and general requirements the same as the Curlew.
The young of both species I have reared from the egg.
Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus).
Another delightful wader is the common Lapwing. These do well
in either a pool-aviary or open enclosure. Being smaller, however,
than the species already mentioned, they require more careful pro-
tection from vermin. A walled-in garden suits them admirably. This
brings to my mind my first and youthful attempt at this form of
aviculture, which was to keep a pair of wing-clipped Lapwings in the
well-fenced garden of my boyhood home. There I well recollect
the pleasure which these graceful and beautiful birds gave to the
inmates of the house as they watched them from the windows trotting
about a moderate-sized lawn, or wading in a small pool.

Members of the Avicultural Society may be interested in this new
project being developed in Doncaster in connection with the Museum
and Art Gallery. Many Members may personally know Mr. A. H.
White, formerly of the Parrot House at the London Zoo, who
has joined the staff here as Head Keeper. Both Mr. White and
myself will be glad to meet any members who may be passing
through Doncaster and who have a little time to spare. The Zoo is
open every day, but a telephone call or letter would be advisable
regarding week-ends to ensure meeting any special officer.
Apart from numerous common birds, some recent additions to the
bird collections are as follows :--
Chestnut-bellied Starling ( Spreo pulcher pulcher), a female Abyssinian
Ground Hornbill ( Bucorvus abyssinicus) , and the Green-billed Toucan
(.Rhamphastos discolor). Four Cactus Conures ( Aratinga cactorum
cactorum) and a further pair of Finsch's Conures ( Aratinga Jinschi).
A very nice pair of Illiger's Macaws (Ara maracana) have also arrived,
as well as two young African Ringneck Parrakeets ( Psittacula krameri
krameri).

A White-fronted Amazon Parrot (Amazona leucocephala ) is one ol

This specimen came from Costa Rica, but does not agree with any

fronted Amazon, but has a rather different distribution of the yellow

not appear to be a very young bird, but we are waiting to see what

BREEDING THE LUTINO NYASALAND
LOVEBIRD IN CALIFORNIA

By David West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
This pretty mutation first appeared in Australia during the early
i93o's and was eventually established in Australian aviaries. An
importation of seven or eight Australian-bred lutino Nyasalands into
England in 1937 did not prove successful. Apparently the birds were
almost all hens, and rather shy breeders.
In 1940 a Mrs. Reed, of El Monte, California, reported rearing
a lutino. What became of this bird I do not know, but lutino Nyasas
did not reappear in California until the i95o's. At this time the
Rudkins, Junior and Senior, had several young lutinos reared from
green parents, but were unable to establish a strain.
This year I was very pleased to find, among a nest of greens, a
lovely lutino youngster. They are very easy to spot, even at an early
age, for their skin is very light and the ruby-coloured eye is easily
seen. This particular nest contained four greens and the one lutino.
The parents reared the five without trouble, and all left the nest in
due time.
Lutinos appear a little slower to learn self-reliance than their
normal-coloured brothers and sisters. However, within a few days
the lutino was doing just as well as the others, and has continued to
do so. It would be my guess that lutino Nyasas, like lutinos of other
species, are a little more sensitive to the light than normals of the
same species. They seem to take a while longer in learning to judge
distances, etc., but once used to the aviary do very well.
1 he contrast between the pink head and the bright yellow body is
very lovely, and the pink is repeated in the tail feathers. They are

}uite striking birds, and certainly the equal in beauty to lutino
Ringnecks.
Since most Agapornis have a tendency to overbreed, to try and
;ircumvent this I usually take and destroy their old nest a few days
ifter the family has flown. Then by giving them new nest-boxes
ind fresh building materials it will usually require them several weeks
before a complete new nest has been built, and during this time the
adults have had a short period of rest. The favourite building
material seems to be palm fronds, which are easily obtained here in
Southern California and have the added advantage of retaining
moisture and thus helping to prevent the eggs from drying out.
I feed my Nyasas a mixture of canary, oats, sunflower, millet, and
hemp. In addition, they like greens of all kinds, and mine will eat
oranges, apples, and are very very fond of fresh corn on the cob.
While they are rearing young I feed soaked bread, and they seem to
like this very much while in the process of rearing young ones.

Of the birds received during July and August, three are forms not
previously exhibited. These are a pair of the Chinese Pied Wood-
pecker ( Dendrocopus major cabanisi ), a Chinese Rufous-backed Shrike
(Lanius schach ), and a Noisy Robin-Chat ( Cossypha bicolor).
The Woodpeckers are, of course, a race of the familiar Greater-
spotted or Pied which they very much resemble. The Shrike is a
graceful and delicately tinted bird. These were presented, together
with two Little Egrets, two young Indian Coucals, a second Chinese
Koel and a Black-faced or Masked Jay-Thrush, by Dr. K. C. Searle.
The Noisy Robin-Chat (deposited) was shown at the National
Exhibition last January and, if I remember rightly, the year before.
A tame young Ground Hornbill or Brom-vogel ( Bucorvus leadbeateri )
was presented &apos;by Mr. Raymond Hook and Mr. John Seago ; an
Aubry's Parrot, also known as the Gaboon Red-crowned or Red-
fronted and the first to be exhibited here since many years ago, by
Mrs. A. M. Stewart ; four of what appear to be the Eastern Pin-
tailed Sandgrouse by H.E. the Mutasariff of Erbil ; four Ceylon
Necklace Doves by Mr. Derek Goodwin ; two Diamond Doves by
Mr. Astley Richards and three Golden-winged Sunbirds by Mr. J. R.
Newmark.
A Blue Whistling Thrush, two South American Black Vultures,
two Tri-coloured Herons, two Buff-backed Herons, two Little Blue
Herons, two Venezuelan Wood Rails and two Sulphury Tyrants
have been received in exchange.

Racquet-tailed Humming-birds (Discosura longicaudo ) are again in |
the Collection, the first since 1934 when five were received--two
purchased and three presented by Capt. de Quincey. Four of these
did not live long but the fifth lived for 2J years when it died of senility.
Two King Penguin chicks have been hatched and the Gulls have
bred well, four Greater Black-backed, two Lesser Black-backed, three
Herring and one Silver being reared. A brood of Common Peafowl
are now nearly half-grown and one of them is a Black-winged, a
mutation unknown in the wild state. A pair of white Peafowl have a
young family of four and there are a number of various young
pheasants and some Upland and Egyptian goslings.
The Red-breasted Geese laid, but the eggs were infertile. Two
Green-winged Kings have left the nest ; also two Cockatiels, some
blue-bred Masked Lovebirds, a Swainson's x Red-collared Lorikeet,
and two Crested Pigeons. A pair of Black Crakes at the Bird House
nested and one chick hatched, but it did not survive.
The Long-tailed Parrakeets nested and four eggs were laid, but
did not hatch. The hen has been here for nearly two years and the
cock, a young bird not quite in full colour, for nearly a year.
The Satin Bower-birds built three nests, but no eggs were laid ;
a young pair of the Gough Island Coots also got as far as building
a nest.

All too seldom is anything further heard of " first breeding " pairs.
It is, therefore, all the more refreshing to hear of two such pairs
that have been consistently successful in rearing broods. In 1949 E. N.
T. Vane's Noble Macaws reared a nest of four and young have been
bred almost annually since : The total reared must now be approaching
thirty. 1 his year four second and one third generation young were

followed by nests of five both last year and the present.

Reference to the early volumes of the Avicultural Magazine and
&apos;ird Notes shows that towards the end of the last century Madagascar
ovebirds were advertised at between 2s. 9 d. and 3.?. 6 d. a pair. At the
irn of the century the price rose slightly to 4s. 6 d. and this was main-
lined up to about 1905 when it gradually dropped until, just prior to
le Great War, they were offered at as low as 2s. 6 d. a pair. Supplies
len became short and after the war the price rose steadily until 1925
r hen the top price appears to have been 25 s. Then followed regular
nportations and by the time of the imposition of the Parrot ban in
930 the price had dropped to ioj - . Thereafter there were, of course,
o further importations and the species was gradually lost to British
viculture. The Madagascar or Grey-headed Lovebird is virtually
nknown to the present generation of aviculturists and is now regarded
5 a rare and very desirable species, as evidenced by the fact that
&quot;cently a number of pairs were offered, and were not wanting in
uyers, at # 15-^18 a pair. The current price appears to be #10. And

CROSS BETWEEN CANADA GANDER AND DOMESTIC CHINESE GOOSE

It may be of interest to record that I have successfully hatched two goslings which
are a cross between a Canada gander and a domestic Chinese goose. They were
hatched in an electric incubator, are nearly two weeks old, and doing very well
( 1 5th July, 1956). The Wildfowl Trust have no record of this particular cross and I
am wondering if this is a first time ?
fhe history of the parent birds and some of the circumstances of the case are
interesting.
A year ago a so-called " sportsman " shot a Canada goose on her nest by a Cheshire
mere. On picking her up he found five newly hatched goslings. He took them home
with the avowed intention of fattening them up for Christmas. Hearing of this some
weeks later, I decided to save two of them from the pot and, hoping for a pair, acquired
the largest and the smallest of the goslings. These were placed in my paddock with
three rather older domestic Chinese goslings.

During last winter two of the Chinese fell victims to foxes and I was left with two
lanadas and one Chinese.
Although the Canada geese appear to be a gander and a goose, and spend most of
heir time together, mating was seen to occur between the male Canada and the
;male Chinese. The female Canada, being immature, made no attempt to nest.
After several failures we finally succeeded in hatching the two goslings. In the
own they are very similar to the illustrations of Canada goslings in Waterfowl of the
Vorld , and it will be interesting to see how they look when feathered.

FIRST IMPORTATION OF DIGGLE'S FINCH ( Poephila atropygialis)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998540692307692" page_id="58073105"  page_num="197" year="" vol="">
We have recently received from Australia four pairs of Diggle's Finch ( Poephila
tropygialis) which is also known as the Black-tailed Finch and the Black-rumped
inch, and as far as we know has never before been imported into this country.
It is a near relative of the Parson Finch and the Long-tailed Grassfinch, resembling
.le former in shape but the latter as to its body colour. The Parson Finch is what
would describe as biscuit-brown with a grey head, whereas the Long-tailed
Irassfinch is of a very pale cafe-au-lait colour with a light silvery-grey head.
Aggie's Finch, on the other hand, is perhaps even lighter in colour than a Long-
liled, which makes its black markings stand out very strikingly. In other respects
ncluding its black beak) it resembles a Parson Finch, except for its slightly larger
ze and the fact that, instead of having a black tail and white rump, both its tail
nd rump are black--so, although superficially alike, the two species are really
uite distinct.

Diggle's Finch, under the name of the Black-tailed Finch, figures in Cayley's
What Bird is That ? but the coloured illustration of it is rather misleading as it
makes it appear to be a slightly darker shade of brown than the Parson Finch,
which is not correct. He gives its habitat as Northern Queensland only, and the
distribution of the Parson Finch as Queensland and New South Wales.
This is the first time we have ever had this rare species of Poephila at Keston and

In the interesting note by Mr. C. J. O. Harrison on Fire-Finches, I am surprised
to read that the Common Fire-Finch-- Lagonosticta senegala --was bred for the first
time by the Rev. C. D. Farrar in 1898. As a matter of fact this very beautiful
little bird was imported into Europe in the eighteenth century, and Vieillot was
probably the first to breed it. In his famous book Les Oiseaux chanteurs , published
in 1790 in Paris, he describes the display of the cock before the hen, the nest, the
eggs, etc. He adds that the breeding season is during the winter months and that
a high temperature is necessary to bring up the young. Many other bird-lovers
have bred this bird in France and Germany before 1898. In my opinion it is the
easiest to breed of all the Waxbills, and the most charming.

The Crested Firebacks are large Pheasants, although they are far
rom reaching the size of Peafowls or Argus ; but they are heavy and
hickset. They have rather short, curved tails ; high, strong legs ; and
Doth sexes possess a thick crest formed by many stiff feathers, bare
&gt;n the lower half. The males are mostly metallic blue and the females
:hestnut-brown. As is the case with the allied Bulwer's Pheasant, the
ace wattles are blue. Crested Firebacks live in Malaysia, in lowland
brests ; they resemble in habits the Kalijs and Silver Pheasants.
Borneo and the neighbouring islands are the home of birds in
vhich the males have chestnut under-parts and cinnamon central tail-
bathers ; but those found in the Malay Peninsula and in the greater
3art of Sumatra are mostly black underneath with white central tail-
bathers. Only in the south-east of Sumatra are there birds with mixed
Jack and white, or chestnut under-parts ; some cocks even have
ulvous tail-feathers, differing from the Bornean race only by the
Daler chestnut parts of the plumage and by their shape, which is
ilways heavier. The truth is that Vieillot's Firebacks, fine as they
ire, are not quite as beautifully shaped and coloured as their
3ornean cousins.
The females of both are very similar, but Vieillot's hens are always
arger, shorter on the legs, and their tail is chestnut instead of black.
Vso, their legs differ ; they are pink in Vieillot's, white in
lornean Firebacks. Finally, the eye wattles are slightly differently
haped, showing four lobes in Vieillot's and two in Borneans, and
here is a small reddish spot at the lowest part of it in the former.
Crested Firebacks are easy to keep, and breed freely in the milder
Darts of Europe and America, such as Italy, Southern France, and
California. Elsewhere they are not very satisfactory unless one
Drovides special accommodation. Although they can stand the

winter in unheated shelters, it is better not to expose them to frost i
or their toes may suffer. Their worst drawback is that, in the colder
districts, they come into breeding condition too late in the season,
laying in July or August, so that the young hatch too late to be
reared satisfactorily.
Bornean Crested Firebacks are now very scarce in captivity and
there is no breeding stock at present either in Europe or in the
United States, but Vieillot's have been freely imported and bred in
both continents during the last two or three years.

"'BROKEN' WING"

<bodyText confidence="0.993908035714286" page_id="58073114"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
By Dr. F. B. Lake (Kingston-on-Thames, England)
This spring, a young Blackbird, which had been rescued from a
cat, was brought to me with a " broken " wing. This proved to be,
as is usually the case, not a fracture but a dislocation of the carpal
joint, and as it is a fairly common injury the very simple method
used to cure it may be of interest.
The lateral part of the wing, with all the primary feathers, was
twisted outwards, as in the accompanying sketch, and flailed about
helplessly when the bird tried to fly. Examination showed that the
carpal joint, supporting the terminal part of the wing which carries the
primaries, was dislocated and could be moved freely in all directions.
Clearly, if this was to heal, movement must be controlled in some
way, for the injured joint was wrenched violently whenever the bird
tried to fly. Splinting or fixing in any way seemed hardly possible,
so the experiment was tried of simply cutting off short, with scissors,
all the feathers distal to the injured joint, that is, all the primaries.
d he weight and wind resistance of the primaries being removed,
the injured part no longer flapped about when the bird tried to fly,
but moved passively with the rest of the wing and laid in correct
position when the wings were folded. The bird was kept in a small
aviary with a series of perches close together to form a ladder down
to the ground. The wing healed in perfect alignment, and when the
bird moulted and grew new primaries there was no visible evidence
of the injury and flight was good.
One hesitates to write about, and illustrate, such a simple device,
but all previous cases of this injury that I have seen have resulted in
a permanently crippled and disfigured bird, so I thought the success
of this method might be worth reporting.

<bodyText confidence="0.976383476190476" page_id="58073116"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
By Roy A. Scott (Broadmeadow, N.S.W., Australia)
My interest in softbills goes back to 1944, from which date I have
read every article I could on this fascinating branch of aviculture.
Unfortunately, most of them were written for British conditions and re-
ferred more to keeping in cages than breeding in aviaries. It was not
till late 1951 that I first met Dr. Brown, who is a softbill breeder
with years of experience. The Doctor has since taught me more than
all the articles put together ; admittedly he does have advantage
over most of the article writers, in that he is an experienced breeder, [
and his birds are kept under similar weather conditions to my own.
Over the years I have kept common Starlings, Satin Bower Birds,
and a few different Honeyeaters but none of what to us are the rarer
softbills. Just prior to Christmas, 1953, a pair of Black Tanagers
was obtained from the Doctor to see if they would go to nest in my
main aviary, but that season no attempt was made. The hen was in
her first year when she came into my care, and prior to her and a
sister being reared that season (1952-3) their mother was the only
hen in Australia. Her father is a wild-bred bird which the Doctor
brought back from America in 1937, and the mother one-generation
aviary-bred. The cock was one-generation aviary bred and over twelve
years old. It has a split upper mandible, the result of a nostril infection,
and Dr. Brown nearly destroyed him a dozen times in case it spread
to other birds ; fortunately he could never bring himself to do it
and the cock recovered, but has a permanently damaged beak. It
is now rather important, being the only fit cock bird (in responsible
hands) in Australia that is not very closely related to the hens, and
even he is a half-brother of his mate's mother (same mother, different
father). Young from him are needed to give a slight change of blood
and so allow the establishment of them more fully in Australia and
not let them go the way of many other beautiful birds which were in
non-breeders' hands. In view of this even the anti-breeders should
realize why 1 am so proud at having reared young this season, even
if it has no so-called scientific value.
Their aviary is 6 feet wide at the front by 9 feet deep and 7 ft. 6 in.
high, 4 feet of the roof (lengthwise) is covered, the other 2 feet being
open wire-netting. The front faces east and contains the door and
safety porch in the right-hand corner. A privet is growing in the
left front corner (under the roof), and a small shrub in the middle of
the back wall (also mostly under shelter). To give more protection
from the weather and provide nesting sites, a wire netting partition
containing Ti-tree branches runs lengthwise down the middle from
about 4 feet from the ground to the roof.

The aviary is well sheltered from the prevailing winds ; the south
by the high wall of a service station and the west side boarded in, the
open sides being our sunny sides. The north side has a 6 ft. high
aviary adjoining it, but it provides very little shelter.
Other than natural sites, two nests were provided ; one, a wire
netting cup, was placed on the back wall and little over half-way up
and partly screened by the low shrub and the Ti-tree division. The
other was a box 7 inches wide, 6 inches deep, and 6 inches high
at front, sloping to 8 inches high at the back, with half the front
open and a tin roof slightly overhanging it. This was placed near the
roof, half was along the mostly open north side.
In the same aviary there are a pair of Neophema bourkii and a
pair of self-fawn Bengalese. Feeding is upon simple lines, millet,
canary seed, and hulled oats being supplied for the Bourkes and
Bengalese ; the Tanagers are particularly fond of the oats and I suspect
eat that of the others as well. The Bourkes get even by being the first
on to the softbill mixture and also get their share of the mealworms.
Softbill mixture consists of wheatmeal biscuits (ground), to which
dripping and honey are added ; when fed (every morning) some finely-
sieved egg (both white and yolk) is added. Bananas are fed ad lib
and pears, grapes, apples, tomatoes, and orange are supplied, though
not necessarily all at once ; other fruits are also supplied when avail-
able. It has been noticed they often tire of one fruit, not touching
it for weeks ; this is particularly noticeable with bananas, but I have
never known them to refuse pear no matter how much it is offered.
Green food (mostly lettuce or milk thistle) and grit are also given.
A few mealworms or grasshoppers are supplied but not necessarily
every day, although the supply is increased as the breeding season
approaches to bring the birds into breeding condition.
I do not regard live food as important as fruit for non-breeding
pairs. One man, to my knowledge, keeps two cocks on nothing else
but seed ; the Doctor also kept one on millet for six months (as an
experiment) without any ill-effects. While they can be kept on seed
I doubt if such a method would ever get a Black Tanager into breeding
condition or allow it the twenty odd years' life span it can otherwise
expect if properly cared for.
With the hen more matured the 1954-5 season was approached
with much confidence on my part. By October the birds showed
interest in both nesting sites provided and began carrying around
some of the material I had supplied. Nesting material consisted of
strips of palm leaves, gladiola leaves, banana leaves, broad reed leaves,
and a few feathers. Black Tanagers prefer broad leaves for nesting
and as a rule completely ignore finer grasses, at least that is the Doctor's
experience. The Doctor's original hens built cup nests in the bushes,
but this hen's mother uses a box and apparently her daughters follow

her footsteps, as both used boxes this season. The only trouble with
my pair was that whatever was placed in the box one day was removed
the next, with the result my hopes rose and fell from day to day
and month to month.
Then on Thursday, 27th January, I examined the box to see what
was in it and to my horror broke one of the two eggs laid on the
bare floor of the box. I promptly built a nest, placed the remaining
egg in it and to my joy the hen immediately went on and began sitting.
As there were only two eggs and the usual clutch is three it was hoped
a third egg would be laid the next day, and I anticipated the young
would hatch in the twelve to thirteen days from then, on 8th February.
Four to six mealworms were supplied every couple of hours and finally
on Saturday, 12th February, when the young were sadly overdue,
I examined the nest and found one clear egg. It may have been
naturally clear or else stale before I discovered it and made the nest.
It was at this time that I wrote to the Secretary stating my opinion
on the importance of breeding Softbills and imploring others to send
in their experiences as an answer to the anti-breeders. Being late in
the season I hoped for, but never really expected, another nest.
The nest was left as it was and a week later, on Saturday, 19th
February, the hen was again noticed sitting. No attempt was made to
see how many eggs there were as I had no intention of disturbing
her any more than was necessary. From the short period since the
other eggs were removed I assumed she had only just began laying.
At this juncture might I add that my duties as a member of the Royal
Australian Air Force (even though stationed near home) involve
my being away from home from 6.30 a.m. to nearly 6 p.m. Monday
to Thursday and an hour or so less on Fridays. Thus my time for close
observation is limited and also shared with a large stud of Border
Fancy Canaries as well as a few finches. As a result I depend a lot
on my wife for any special feeding during the day, as readers will
realize later.
The following week there was almost continuous heavy rain and flood
warnings were issued for many areas. I went to work as usual on the
Friday, then without any warning was amongst the R.A.A.F. detach-
ment that went in to do relief work in the disastrous Maitland floods
which reached their peak that night. My sudden absence without any
preparation or instructions on feeding a collection of over 200 birds
(mostly canaries) placed a large burden on my wife, particularly
as we have three young kiddies, the youngest at the time only six
weeks old. Fortunately my brother-in-law helped out, or my losses
would have been far greater than the few I did lose through faulty
feeding, miserable weather, and general lack of attention.
On arriving home the following Tuesday afternoon the Tanagers
seemed disinterested in the nest. Being in a tired condition and

probably not thinking too clearly I entered the aviary and examined
the nest ; two eggs were noticed and the one examined was both
dark and warm so a quick exit was made out of the aviary. Four
to six mealworms were then provided every couple of hours. Each
morning I was disappointed to see no apparent change in the old
bird's behaviour, but as the hen was still sitting all was not lost and
the mealworm supply kept up.
I arrived home about 4.30 p.m. on the Friday (4th March)
to find much activity on the part of both birds, the cock displaying
around the box and both begging for live food. Medium-sized meal-
worms were supplied and I had the satisfaction of seeing both birds
feed to an extent which to my untaught mind suggested two young.
Fortunately I had four days off work so I was able to give whatever
young they had a good start in life.
One of the first things Dr. Brown had taught me was to disbelieve the
stories about too many mealworms being harmful and sending pairs
back to nest ; the trouble he assured me is not supplying enough instead
of the opposite. He has reared Scarlet Tanagers on mealworms alone,
but a more varied diet produces the better young ; so, provided
their birds will feed with mealworms, fanciers should not worry
about using them ad lib. On the Saturday mealworms and small grass-
hoppers were supplied as required from 6 a.m. till dark. Every time
the parents begged for food it was supplied until they started to eat it
themselves ; I would let them eat two or three, then put a couple
more in the dish to make sure. In this respect I found the cock the
best feeder from the start in that he fed almost everything given him
whereas the hen would feed a couple then eat a couple herself. 1 he
hen came to a dish on a ledge half-way up the front ol the aviary,
but the cock usually begged down under the privet, so a dish was
placed there and live food supplied in both. I tried them with meal-
worms cut in halves, but they obviously preferred the whole worms,
so I saw no purpose in continuing with this practice and accepted
that the parents know what is best for their babies.
Sunday dawned wet and miserable, and I was worried when they
never fed by 6.30 a.m., but apparently it was only due to the dull
day, as I noticed during the ensuing bad weather that they fed much
later on dull mornings than on fine mornings. Live food supplied was
mainly mealworms, although I did manage to get a few grasshoppers
and a soaking for the effort.
With all the wet weather about (most since 1890) I was pleased
that they had chosen a box instead of an open nest, although perhaps
it would not have mattered as the privet is not exposed to rain.
Dr. Brown's experience with open nests has been that 24 hours
continuous rain means nothing worse than the breeder catching
pneumonia from the regular feeding and chasing live food, but

that the young usually succumb if the rain continues longer thar
that.
Monday proved a lovely day and mealworms and hoppers were
supplied as required. Bourkes were raiding quite a few mealworms,
but I decided it was better to let them have their share than to disturb
the Tanagers by catching them out. Butterflies and small moths were
offered but the old birds ignored them, although later they seemed
quite fond of them.
Tuesday (5th day), another fair day and mealworms and grass-
hoppers were again supplied as needed. By now larger grasshoppers
were being offered, but the real big hoppers were cut into half-inch
lengths and only the body used.
Wednesday (6th day), returned to work so a different method of
feeding was needed. My wife will not handle live food by hand,
so about 100 mealworms were put into a jar and a paper funnel
made to slide them through the wire into the dishes. About ten
mealworms were supplied every hour throughout the day. Cut-up
grasshoppers (bodies only at this stage) were put in dishes and kept in
an ice chest, these were fed at 10 a.m., 12 noon, and 2 p.m., then further
grasshoppers were supplied by a brother-in-law at 4.30 p.m., and
more by myself at 6 p.m. I collected a fair number of grasshoppers,
also a couple of case-moth grubs during lunch-time.
Thursday (7th day), another wet, miserable day with a cyclone
threatening. Feeding was as the day before plus the case-moths.
The weather hindered my grasshopper catching, but I managed
to get a few.
Friday (8th day), the promised cyclone had moved away, resulting
in a fair day with only a few showers. Feeding was as before up till
lunch-time when I arrived home early, then as required. This was
the first time I heard the young make any noise when being fed.
Saturday (9th day), a fine day, the best for weeks. Being away
myself, feeding was carried out by my wife. Dr. Brown was good
enough to come out and check that everything was going right.
Sunday (10th day), another very fine day and I managed to collect
a large number of grasshoppers and these, and mealworms, were fed
as required.
Monday (1 ith day), another fine day, my wife fed as before.
luesday (12th day), heavy rain started about 4 a.m. and did
not stop all day. The old birds showed no interest in live food at
6.30 a.m. when I left, but the hen was still sitting. Despite the weather
I managed to get a few hoppers and case-moth grubs. Both birds
seemed disinterested when I came home and after the very heavy
rain I was worried. Then really to make me down in the dumps
the wife said they had been like that all day, leaving mealworms
in the dish and only using about half the usual number. Dr. Brown

had been out and told my wife this was quite usual as they start
feeding more mixture and fruit when the young are due to leave the
nest ; nevertheless, I was still a little uneasy.
Efforts were made to shine a light into the nest-box after dark
to see if the hen was sitting, but it appeared empty. Then, when
all was given up as lost, a bouncing baby was noticed in the privet
just inside the front of the aviary. A hessian screen was quickly
hung on the wire to keep out wind and rain. It had left on the 12th
day which actually makes it eleven days old.
Wednesday (13th day), the night proved even worse than the
day it followed so it was a much relieved breeder who next morning
saw his pride and joy still in the land of the living. Early search
revealed only one young, also no sign of a second egg. In colour
the youngster was slightly duller than the hen, also slightly smaller
in body and with only about half an inch of the tail. The weather was
inconsistent, alternating between bright sunshine and heavy showers.
Feeding was as usual but still not so many mealworms taken.
Thursday (14th day), similar weather and feeding programme,
to the Wednesday.
Friday (15th day). Good day for a change. Was amused before
leaving for work by witnessing the parents trying to feed the youngster
while it was sitting on a slender branch too light to take their weight.
Their antics were well worth seeing until they finally persuaded it to
move to a stronger perch. The feeding was as usual.
Saturday (16th day), rained during night, dull day with few light
showers and a few patches of sunshine. Being home myself feeding
was as required, and having collected a dozen or so case-moth grubs
on the Friday, these were added to the diet and were easy favourites.
Live food consumption appeared back to normal while hardly any
fruit except a little pear was eaten.
Sunday (17th day). Fair day, no rain and quite a bit of sunshine.
Few case-moth grubs and hoppers were fed, but for a change mainly
mealworms were used.
Monday (18th day) saw a return to brighter weather with sunshine
all day and temperatures were in the 80 degree mark and remained
so for the rest of the week. Each evening before dark the parents were
noticed persuading their baby to retire to the safety of the privet
for the night. Managed to get a nice lot of case-moth grubs ; these,
grasshoppers, and mealworms were fed, with a noticeable drop in the
mealworms taken, the larger insects being more favoured. There was
also an increase in the mixture and fruit taken, the main fruit used
was pear with grapes and banana also used a fair bit, while a little
rock melon was also used.
It was noticed that whereas the parents previously gave the food
straight to the youngster it was now forced to tug it from the old bird's

beak, and was thus taught to start and fend for stuff. Then on
Saturday, 2nd April, the hen was again noticed sitting and a mirror
inspection of the nest revealed two eggs.
Sunday saw another return to the wet weather with the cyclone
again threatening in the north. Up to date mostly pear was used,
but from now on a sudden increase in the use of banana was noticed.
More mixture was also being fed and the demand for live food reduced.
The hen was content to leave most of the rearing to the cock and
concentrated on sitting.
Easter was marred by heavy rain of over i inch per day, but the
hen continued to sit and the youngster to grow.
Tuesday, 12th April. Suspected that they might have hatched
judging from the antics of the old pair. I caught the young one and
transferred it to Dr. Brown's and left mealworms for the usual feeding
by my wife. I was worried on arriving home on the Wednesday
to find that I had failed to put the mealworms in their usual spot,
as a result my wife thought no feeding was required.
Thursday morning found the hen still sitting but acting as though
she might have young. It proved a beautiful day and I was pleased
to learn on arriving home that plenty of live food was being taken.
Banana consumption had dropped to almost nil since the removal
of the older young one.
Friday was a mixed day, early morning fog, bright sunshine most
of the day then very cold afternoon and night. They were showing
a marked preference to hoppers over mealworms when the former were
available, but managed to get only a few, so they settled on meal-
worms. Since catching the older young one they had been very wary
of me, particularly the hen.
Saturday was cold but fine ; being home and doing all the feeding
myself I managed to regain their confidence--food : mealworms
and grasshoppers as required.
Sunday proved a similar day to the Saturday.
Monday was again wet and miserable--my wife fed as before.
Tuesday and Wednesday--cold but fine.
Thursday and Friday--cool nights but lovely days--feeding as
usual except for addition of few case-moths.
Saturday and Sunday were fair days and feeding was as required.
Monday saw a few showers but mainly fine, my wife doing the
feeding. One youngster flew and was greeted by one of the worst
nights in weeks. "
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday were little improve-
ment, but the baby showed no ill-effects--fed as usual.
Saturday was another mixed day, mostly dull with occasional
showers and sunny spots.
The process of putting baby to bed was again witnessed and its two

parents were very worried until they managed to coach junior to a
safe perch.
Sunday was a nice day and plenty of grasshoppers were supplied
as well as a few case-moth grubs and mealworms, the only fruit
used in any quantity was pear.
Monday proved another nice day and I managed to collect a
lovely lot of case-moth grubs which was unusual for this time of the
year.
The weather was now more settled with less rain and the feeding
was continued as before, although an increase in the use of fruit and
mixture was balanced by a decrease in live food used. The youngster
was left with the parents for a few weeks then transferred to Dr. Brown's.
These being the only two youngsters bred in Australia this season
I am naturally quite proud of my first softbill breeding effort,

of my good wife and the advice of Dr. Brown. The young have proved

from the Doctor and the cock retained by myself.

BREEDING LA YARD'S PARRAKEETS--ALMOST
BY ACCIDENT
By R. G. Kirkham (Clonskeagh, Co. Dublin, Eire)
Early last December, I was fortunate enough to receive direct from

<bodyText confidence="0.990030625" page_id="58073123"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
Ceylon an excellent young pair of these small, but very attractive,
Parrakeets. They were closely confined for the long sea voyage,
and appeared to have been quarrelling. However, a long rest in a
spacious indoor compartment soon put them right, and as the days
grew longer they were given opportunity for outdoor flight, and a
chance to bathe in the rain--all of which helped their appearance
and condition, if not their temper. The cock was not a friendly bird,
but at least I could tempt him to examine a peanut at close quarters,
while the hen if offered a nut would go for the finger holding it instead,
and shriek with annoyance if she missed.
In due course May arrived, and practically every compartment
capable of holding a breeding pair was filled, and so, not bothering
very much about the Layard's as a breeding possibility, I parked them
in a rather small compartment measuring about 8 feet by 6 feet by
3 feet, with a small shelter attached and furnished with a grandfather
clock nest-box partly filled with turf-mould. To my surprise, the

hen became very interested in the nest-box and spent quite a bit of
time in it. On several occasions, mating was observed early in the
morning, usually about 7.30 a.m., and about the end of the month
two eggs were laid. The exact dates could not be ascertained as the
hen became such a little fury and would not permit anyone to enter
the flight. In fact, on the only occasion that the eggs were seen, the
hen had to be caught up, and this seemed to upset her very much,
so it was not repeated. As I have said, two eggs were laid, and these
were exceptionally large for the size of the bird, being if anything
bigger than a Ringneck's. Accurate hatching time could not be
observed, though the young were heard but not seen early in July. The
hen did all the feeding, and at times she even fed the cock. She
consumed large quantities of spinach, but especially the stalks, also
apple and unlimited quantities of sunflower and peanuts. Spray
millet was provided, but not touched, but soaked hemp was greedily
taken and very quickly eaten, though only given sparingly about once
a week. Towards the end of July, the cock joined in the fun, and
instead of acting only as watchman, started to feed the hen, and
would I think have fed the young had he been permitted, but the hen
would not allow him to put a foot inside the nest, and only permitted
him an occasional and hurried peep through the entrance hole. The
first youngster left the nest on Sunday, 26th August, in a downpour,
and as it could not fly, I spent a great deal of time catching up the
spitfire and then replacing her offspring in the nest. To-day's date,
6th September, and the second youngster has not yet ventured forth
though it has peeped out and been on the verge, but to tell the truth
I do not think it is very impressed with what the outside world has
to offer it--rain and still more rain. Can't say I blame it !
Footnote .--The two youngsters have the same cherry coloured beak
as the cock, though not so bright, and I understand this changes to
black with the first moult, which if the birds are hens stays black, but
if cocks changes back again to cherry red.
8 th September .--The second youngster finally ventured out to-day.
The sun made a brief appearance and so did he (or she). Both young
birds are being constantly fed by the hen and admired by the cock.
I think he is very proud of his offspring who are already nearly as big
as he is, and will I fancy be even larger in a few weeks time.

By Dr. R. E. B. Brown (Newcastle, N.S.W., Australia)
For some years I have been trying to breed the Regent Bower Bird
and up till last summer I have always had to remove the cock to save
his life before any nesting operations could occur.
I have watched these birds, both in the wild state and in captivity,
for over twenty years and have come to the conclusion that in the wild
state there is very little association between the sexes. The hens go
about together, the cocks also, but very rarely the two sexes together.
When one sees what looks like a pair in the rain forest, it is nearly always
a mature cock accompanied by an immature one.
A friend and I watched an incident a few years ago that showed this
very plainly. A flock of fourteen Regent hens had taken possession of a
large, wild fig tree which was covered with ripe fruit, and used to stay
in this tree all day. They took no notice at all of the numerous Lewin's
Honeyeaters and Zosterops that were also in the tree all day, or of the
flock of eighteen immature King Parrakeets that visited the tree several
times daily. But as soon as a cock Regent appeared they would attack
him with the greatest ferocity.
A flock of eight cocks used to raid the tree every morning about
8 a.m. and try and grab a few figs. The hens always attacked them
at once. The cocks approached the tree at all angles, but they
always escaped the same way, by dropping to near the ground and
flying through the undergrowth pursued by the furious hens. Some of
the cocks would be holding a fig in their beaks, and so intent were they
on escaping, that one day one of them almost brushed against me as
I sat under the tree.
The cocks always have a place where they dance. Sometimes
this is merely an area under a tree swept clear of all leaves, etc., but
sometimes they build a bower there. I think that when a hen wants to
be fertilized she visits the cocks at this place, and I believe that in
my aviary the hen visited the cock when he was dancing under the
broad-leaved rain forest tree.
My hen Regent lives in an aviary 25 feet long, 15 feet broad,
12 feet high. At one end is a large privet tree, at the other end is a
broad-leaved tree from the rain forest (name unknown). There is no
other shelter provided.
All my softbills get the same basic food, a soft mixture I make,
consisting of crushed wheatmeal biscuits, to which honey and melted
beef dripping are added. Each day I add to the daily ration fresh grated
hard-boiled egg. Fruit, such as apple, banana, pear, tomato, orange,
paw paw, mango, and grapes, when in season, is provided. They also
have white ants (termites) daily, and mealworms, grasshoppers, and

case-moth grubs, when available. It is absolutely essential to give all
Bower Birds plenty of green food, otherwise they take fits.
15th October , 1955 .--Hen Regent Bird noticed crooning to hersell
to-day and pulling at pieces of stick in the privet tree (I have had this
bird 5 years).
16th October , 1955 .--A fully coloured cock bird, caught exactly one
year ago, was put in the aviary with her to-day, careful watch being
kept to make sure she does not kill him at once, as usually happens.
18th October , 1955 .--The hen Regent is tolerating the cock. He is very
frightened of her, as they always are. Anyhow she has not killed him
yet.
20th October , 1955 -- Saw the Regents eating white ants out of the
same tray. I take this as a very hopeful sign. She is crooning
a lot and placing a few sticks in a wire fern-basket. He is still
very frightened of her, but he seems to be fairly happy as he
displays to the cock in the next aviary and I have heard him dancing
under the broad-leaf tree. But he has not attempted to build a bower,
as he is too frightened of the hen. He had a nice bower in his previous
aviary, where there were no hens to terrify him.
10th November , 1999 .--The Regent hen has built a very sketchy nest
in the fern-basket, but I have seen no association with the cock. In fact
they spend most of the time at opposite ends of the aviary, she just
tolerates him and that is all, but the fact she has not killed him is
hopeful.
29th November , 1999 .--The hen Regent laid early this morning. It is
quite easy to see the egg, and to watch all her behaviour, through the
bottom of the nest. I don't expect the egg to hatch, as I have never
seen any association with the cock at all. She now will not allow him
to go down to the end of the aviary, where the nest is situated, at all and
he is very frightened of her. She does not interfere with the other birds
in the aviary at all. There are a pair of Maroon Tanagers who have a
nest within 10 feet of hers. A pair of Madagascar Weavers, a pair of
Magpie Tanagers, and a young Olive-backed Oriole are also in the
aviary.
The egg is fairly large, slightly larger than a domestic pigeon's egg.
She is sitting very closely. She alights on the side of the wire basket and
very carefully and gently gets down to the bottom of it, gently lowers
herself on to the egg and then takes it right in under her feathers.
When she is properly on the nest I cannot see the egg at all. She
displays great affection for the egg, crooning to it nearly all the time,
especially when she is turning it over. She has only laid the one egg,
though it is customary to lay two eggs in the wild state.
9th December , 1999 .--I heard a lot of noise in the aviary this morning
and found the hen Regent killing the cock. She had him down in a

corner and was definitely killing him, but I just came in time to save
him. I opened the door of the next aviary and he quickly flew through
and hid under a bin. He was so terrified he remained hidden all day,
but he was not badly hurt.
15th December , 7955.--The hen Regent is still sitting closely, coming
off to feed three times a day, has a bath, then hurries back to the nest.
20th December , 7955.--This afternoon to my astonishment the hen
Regent hatched a young one. It is surprisingly large, being almost as
large as a small domestic chick. The eggshell is still lying in the nest.
The hen fed the young one first with a soft mealworm pupa. Then she
refused more mealworms and pupae so I offered her a small case-moth,
this she eagerly accepted, mashed it up thoroughly for about ten
minutes, took it to the nest, and fed the young one with it from her beak.
She is very affectionate to the young one, crooning all the time she
is feeding it. The young Regent is covered with rather long greyish
down and that is why is seems so large. She has not touched the
white ants yet. I suppose they are too small.
The Maroon Tanagers have two young ones 10 feet from her, but
she has not interfered with them at all. In fact the hen Tanager stole
a case-moth from her while she was mashing it up and fed her own
young with it.

21st December , 7355.--The Regent hen has begun to feed the young
on white ants. Her method is to collect a large number of ants in her
beak and throat, roll them into a ball mixed with much saliva, then
give them to the young one. When she moves her beak away from the
young one you can see strands of saliva stretching from one beak to the
other. She is also quite definitely feeding by regurgitation as well as
by the beak method.
22nd December , 7955.--This morning I went out to the aviary at
6 a.m. The hen Regent was hanging on the wire begging for live food

<bodyText confidence="0.995015" page_id="58073127"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
and I gave her a case-moth. She took it up to the nest, dropped it,
grabbed the young one by the head and flew off with it. She dropped it
at the other end of the aviary. When I picked it up it was still alive
although it had a wound right through its head. I have preserved it
in spirit.
All the rest of the day the hen has been taking food up to the nest,
crooning and obviously looking for the young one and does not seem
to know what she has done.
Two weeks later I put the cock back but she immediately attacked
him and I had to take him away. I have placed him in the next aviary
to hers and he has built a nice bower under the Bougainvillaea vine. I
hope to try again next summer.

By Walther Langberg (Copenhagen, Denmark)
Having bred the Painted Quail for a number of years with reason-
able success, it occurred to me that my experiences as recorded in
the following notes might be of interest to other aviculturists. The
exceptionally warm summer of 1955 was particularly favourable, when
four pairs reared no less than fifty-two chicks, all these young being
fully reared by the parents without resort to incubators or foster-
parents.
Housing
Each pair was kept in an outdoor aviary 1 o feet long by 4 feet wide
by 7 feet high. Three feet of the length was devoted to the shelter
and the open flight was accordingly 7 feet long. The entire floor was
raised above ground level about 15 inches and was made of i-inch
boards covered with " Carbolineum ". Approximately half of the
outside flight was covered with glass. A skirting board about 9 inches
high surrounds the bottom of the flight to act as a windbreak and
to prevent the chicks from passing through the J-inch netting, which
they can easily do. Each of these aviaries housed one pair of parrakeets
in addition to one pair of quail--Rosellas, Stanleys, Crimson-wings,
and Bourkes respectively. In no case did these birds interfere with
the quail, but this happy state of affairs was not achieved in a flight
with a pair of Masked Lovebirds as companions, and one cock quail
was so badly damaged by the Masked that it was lost.
Nesting
Provisions for nesting were very simple. In one corner of the
shelter a low wooden frame about 5 inches by 5 inches by i\ inches
high was placed and firmly held in position by two bricks. The
frame was partly filled with sand, and fine hay and coconut fibre
were provided as nesting material. From these the birds build a
partly-covered nest in which the eggs are laid.
Incubation
Many hens are inclined to lay their eggs all over the place, or to
scatter them around after laying before they eventually decide to lay
in the nest ; some hens, indeed, never seem to settle down to serious
nesting operations and continue to lay their eggs broadcast. The
first step to successful breeding is to secure a hen that is a good
sitter and rearer. The probable reason for this unreliable behaviour
may be that the hens are either too shy after recent importation or
are from an aviary-bred strain raised for some generations by artificial
methods, such as by fostering or in incubators, practices commonly

employed by some continental breeders. There are, however, good
md dependable breeding strains which have been well managed for
generations and trained to rear their young entirely on their own in
:aptivity, and these are decidedly the best birds to acquire.
The period of incubation is about seventeen days. This, in my
experience, is subject to some slight variation, sometimes taking a day
3r two longer ; possibly the external temperature or other conditions
nay have some influence. In any event, no good can come from
:rying to rush matters and the hen should be left quietly alone for
a few more days, to be on the safe side, if the chicks do not appear
an the anticipated date. It is also a difficult matter to estimate
exactly the precise date upon which incubation proper commences.
It often happens, too, that as soon as the first youngster hatches and
leaves the nest the hen follows it and allows the remaining eggs to
become chilled and spoilt. This is of more frequent occurrence when
breeding indoors rather than in an outdoor aviary.
In early days the hen usually broods the young very closely,
covering the minute little creatures--only about the size of a bumble
bee--almost continuously. At this stage they are liable to die if away
from their mother for only a few minutes. Care must therefore be
exercised to ensure that they do not become trapped in feeding
vessels from which they are unable to extricate themselves. It is a
good plan to remove all such utensils out of reach of the young for
the first week, although water should always be available in very
shallow receptacles. In order to prevent the chicks becoming unduly
wet, a small feeding pot may be placed upside down in the water
dish thus leaving only a small area available for the birds to drink
from. Small plastic water fountains might be used, but they should
be fixed firmly to the wall or floor. Many individual cocks give
considerable help in rearing the family and often brood them just
like the hen ; others, however, often ignore the young or even kill
them. It is therefore essential to observe an untried male and watch
his reactions to the arrival of young--if necessary he must be
removed.
Feeding
Quail are mainly fed on small millet, blue maw seed, millet sprays,
egg food, milk sop, an occasional mealworm, and, in season, plenty
of greenfood--preferably chickweed. They also have sprouted millet
and oats throughout the year. The floors of the aviaries should always
be well covered with good clean sand as quail, like all gallinaceous
birds, are very fond of a sand bath. There should always be a constant
supply of eggshell, oyster shell, and fine grit. Proprietary condition
seed mixtures frequently contain a proportion of wild seeds which
are particularly appreciated by quail. Seed is preferably scattered

broadcast on the floor as the birds prefer this to seed pots. Egg-
food and milk sop are supplied in small, flat pots.
When the chicks are newly hatched they should be fed for the firsl
few days on blue maw, and all other seed should be crushed and
scattered on the floor with a little of the egg food. If fresh ants' eggs
are available they are, of course, the best food of all for small chicks,
but they are not essential. Personally, I have never used them. Tiny
mealworms, only the thickness of a needle, are also relished in the
first few days. The chicks soon learn to take larger worms if giver
these thin ones to start them off. The chicks grow very quickly and
at three months have usually moulted out and look exactly like their
parents.

By Rev. J. R. L. Lowe
(Coin St. Aldwyns, Cirencester, England)
The gremlins that delight to add grey hairs to aviculturists are
not always malevolent. They even allowed two young Grey Wagtails
to leave the nest on 7th July--it might have been 7th May if I had
not made a ridiculous mistake.
In May, 1955, I had reared two young Grey Wagtails, hoping
one at least might be a mate for a 1953 hand-reared cock. In the
autumn I gave one away in exchange and kept what I thought was
a hen. By March, 1956, this bird had developed a solid black bib,
and as it was also a good colour I was certain I had a young cock.
Then in mid-May, this young bird began to carry bits and
pieces to a ledge in its aviary, but even then I was not persuaded,
as when I turned the old cock in there was a good deal of sparring,
if not fighting, and as they are good at killing each other in a
comparatively confined space I did not leave them together.
However, in mid-June I was pushed for room and I put them in
a large, planted aviary that has a shelter ; in this aviary there is a
cock Redstart, a pair of Goldfinches with a large young one and
some small second-round babies, four May-hatched Bullfinches, a hen
Canary with two mules by the Goldfinch, a 1956 Golden Pheasant
half-grown, a hen Lazuli Bunting and a hen Siskin. The two
Wagtails agreed to differ, and after a little mutual display each had
its own corner and I paid little attention to them. On 7th July
I went into the shelter and on a shelf moved a small travelling box.
Imagine my amazement when inside was a typical Grey Wagtail

nest containing two babies almost ready to leave. I shall never know
how many eggs there were, or how many hatched.
Live food in the form of gentles and mealworms had been given,
but not as generously as one would have given if rearing young.
Soft food reinforced with egg was always there, as the Goldfinches
and young Bullfinches eat a lot of it. To date, ioth July, the two
young Wagtails are running about the shelter floor and they go into
their nest-box as it is now placed on the floor. The old birds feed the
babies at my feet and soon, I hope, they will all go out into the open
part of the aviary.
The Handbook of British Birds , Vol. I, p. 223, states that the female
(in spring) has " whitish throat, without or only obscurely marked
with black ". This hen has a solid matt throat and bib and quite
strong yellow underparts. The cock has begun to display again,
but it is late for a second round.
A pair of Bullfinches have been madly prolific. Two clutches of
five, eight reared.
Early summer produced hot, dry days and bitter nights, and a lot
of eggs were infertile from hybrid pairs. A trio of Golden Pheasants
have laid solidly from April to July, and while giving at least two
dozen eggs away we are rearing a dozen at different stages. Bantam
mothers are the only answer, and in the early stages we do best with
some live food.
A pair of Redrump Parrakeets, 1955, have had two clutches of
five, and no sign of fertility. Gremlins in real form !
A Lesser Double-collared Sunbird sent to me last October, in a
very poor state, was put outside in May and has had a wonderful
moult, and though we could not keep the lovely red, the new
feathers are quite orange, perhaps because of all the live food he
spends so much time catching.
A young Amethyst cock out of colour is also benefiting from
outdoor treatment and the colour is coming fast ; he is peaceful
in a mixed collection with one other softbill, an Orange-georgetted
Flycatcher. The Double-collared is hopeless with anything smaller
than a Golden Pheasant.
A pair of Sulphury Tyrants have moulted well since being put
out ; they live quite amicably with Necklace Doves. They have
trying voices and I doubt if they could be trusted with small birds.
A pair of Diamond Doves are, I think, possessed ; they must have
laid at least five pairs of eggs, and so far have nothing to show for it.
Sometimes the nest is ridiculously flimsy ; on another occasion, as
the eggs were chipping, the cock started to drive the hen to nest
again and that was that. At the time of writing, ioth July, she is
actually sitting on two eggs on a fairly respectable nest.
Last year I wrote a piece about the hybrid Turtle/Barbary and

Barbary/Turtle Doves. In February we liberated a cock Barbary,
a cock Turtle/Barbary, two Barbary/Turtle hens, a Turtle/Barbary
hen, and a Turtle/Barbary/Barbary hen (second generation). Up to
ioth July rather surprisingly no casualties, though birds reported
often two miles away ; but all come back to feed.
Turtle/Barbary and Barbary/Turtle nested in the garden, produced
one youngster, a rather dull brown colour ; this is occasionally seen,
but seldom comes to the feeding place which is on top of an aviary.
This pair may have big young ones as just in the last few days they
have been appearing together. The Barbary cock and Turtle/Barbary
hen are sitting somewhere in the village, and Turtle cock released in
June has paired to his granddaughter, the second generation
hybrid hen. This pair is now sitting somewhere.
All the doves are at the moment living chiefly off the country
and do not all come regularly to the feed table ; but later perhaps
when food gets shorter and the leaves begin to fall we shall be able
to see what the 1956 crop has produced. The question is, will these
hybrids tend to migrate ?
We have discovered a new way of increasing our Sunday School
attendance ; " Joe " is a large Indian Hill Mynah and his vocabulary
is prodigious. Every Sunday he holds court after Sunday School,
as he adores children, and there is much competition to see and hear]
"Joe", consequently numbers have gone up considerably.
An attempt to produce hybrids between an Indian Jungle Fowli
cock and a hen Mongolian Pheasant has failed. Some seventeen
eggs were duly tested.
Two hen Greenfinches have each laid twenty-four eggs, with noj
result earlier on, paired to a Canary and Goldfinch respectively.
To-day, ioth July, they are sitting each on six eggs, and at last therej
is some fertility.
As I finish this rambling account of frustration and a little success/
"Joe " is coughing and sneezing like a very old man and occasionally
producing a wolf-whistle of extreme vulgarity.

By H. A. Gerrits (Manager of the Wassenaar Zoo, Holland)
The Black-breasted Plover ( Zonifer tricolor tricolor ) belongs to the
genus Zonifer, which is a representative of the family Charadrudae.
Its native country is Australia, where it occurs in Queensland, New
South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia.
In order to give an impression of the appearance of this bird to
those readers who have never had an opportunity of seeing it alive, I
will quote Gould's colour description after which, with the aid of the
photographs, everyone should be able to get an idea of the appearance
of this Australian plover.
Adult Male.-- Crown of the head, line running from the angle of
the mouth beneath the eye, and down the sides of the neck, and
a broad crescent-shaped band across the breast, jet-black ; line from
the eye to near the occiput, chin, throat, flanks, abdomen,, upper-
and under-tail coverts, white ; back, light-brown ; primaries,
brownish-black ; wing-coverts, bronzy-brown passing into black
towards the tip of each feather and tipped with white ; a few of
the outer secondaries white, margined on the extremities ol their
outer webs with black, then a few entirely white, and the last two
marked like the coverts, but largely margined with white ; scapu-
laries and lower part of the back, bronzy-brown ; rump dark olive,
with bronzy reflections ; tail, white, crossed near the tip by a broad
irregular band of black ; tip of the upper mandible, horn-coloured ;
the remainder of the bill, beautiful primrose-yellow ; naked parts of
the sides and knees, dark pink ; tarsi and toes, blackish-brown, the
latter inclining to pink-red ; irides, yellow, surrounded by a rim ol
deep primrose extending in an oblique diiection to the flashy
protuberance at the base of the upper mandible, which is blood red
in the male, much ligher or flesh red in the lemale.
Otherwise the sexes are alike in colour, but the female has the
lobe before the eye much smaller than in the male.
On 9th May, 1953? a pair of Australian Plovers arrived in the
Wassenaar Zoo. The condition was quite good after such a long
journey and, after the birds had been thoroughly accustomed to their
food, they were put into one of the large centre aviaries of the Louise
Hall This 24 ft. X 27 ft. X 13 ft. aviary, with its elongated pond,
trees, and shrubs and thick lawn, is certainly an ideal place loi this
Black-breasted Plover. The Zonifer tricolor were, of course, not the
only occupants of this spacious aviary and they had to share it with
numerous other birds, such as Senegal Bustards, Sun-Bitterns, seveia
plovers, and many pigeons and doves. The Australian Plovers
feed-- a t least in this aviary where, owing to the very mixed population,
a great variety of food is available--mainly on universal food, insects,

mealworms, and dried ant cocoons ; they take a small piece of
minced meat or bread occasionally, but no seeds. Although the
Plovers were surrounded by so many different birds, they behaved
very amiably. They mostly kept to themselves, taking no notice of
the other birds ; they never quarrelled and were always seen in each
others' company. When one of the other birds approached them
too closely they drove it away by noisy cries and wing-beats. If
this method failed, with a much bigger opponent, for instance, they
vanished from its neighbourhood together.
On the other hand, I cannot say that they reserved a certain part
of the aviary as their own domain. They moved freely and undisturbed
through the entire aviary and I noticed that the other birds did not
hinder them at all. This may lead to the conclusion that the
Plover is a quarrelsome or unsocial bird. On the contrary, when the
keeper brings in the food and gives them their daily supply of meal-
worms and insects they eat together with all the other birds without
fighting or trying to obtain more by chasing the others away. For
company, however, they keep to themselves and birds of another
species or genus do not appeal to them. From the outward appearance
of our Australian Plovers it was already obvious that we had a male
and a female--namely, the birds had a clearly-visible difference in
the lobes before the eyes, the lobe of the male being much bigger and
more vividly coloured than that of the female. After a few months
the birds were in excellent condition and with their beautiful colours
and smooth and silky plumage they were really a very welcome
addition.
During the years 1953, I 954 &gt; and 1955 the birds had not made
any breeding attempts and not a single egg had been found in the
aviary. In the middle of the month of February, 1956, however, the
behaviour of the Australian Plovers changed remarkably although
outside the Louise Hall the temperature was about -- 20* C.; they
were continually seen near the entrance door of the aviary and they
kept even more closely together than they used to. On 18th February
the biids occupied a spot close to the entrance door near the dividing
wire-mesh between the aviaries, for the whole day. The female was
very busy turning around with her breast to the ground or shuffling
in a sitting position as if she wanted to examine her work. In this
way she soon succeeded in making a somewhat shallow, but beautifully
rounded, hollow in the ground, which was rather stony. Owing to
frost, night temperatures in that unheated part of the Louise Hall
were under 6* G. The male took no part in these activities but
remained always very close to her and took care that every inhabitant
of the aviary who came near her was kept at a proper distance.
No nest material was available in the aviary during that time, so
the little hollow was not lined at first.

H. A. GERRITS-BREEDING OF THE BLACK-BREASTED PLOVER 221
On 20th February, in the morning, I saw the first egg lying in the
hollow. Neither of the Plovers was on the nest but both did all they
could to keep intruders from stealing or damaging the precious egg.
As both Bustards and Sun-Bitterns in their own aviary, as well as
the Hunting Cissa from the adjoining aviary, were very interested in
the egg with the obvious object of eating it, the future parents ha
an almost impossible task. I therefore decided to give the Plovers
a helping hand and, with violent objection from the owners, took
the egg away till we had made sufficient protection. We then placed
a screen of fine wire-mesh around the nest, so that we made a sort
of separate little aviary of 6 ft. X 2 ft. X 3 ft- the lar Sf aviar y
and placed the water and feeding vessels in it. After we had put
some fine dried grass on the ground we returned the egg m the
hollow and the Plovers could again take possession of their new home.
It was a thrilling moment for it would soon become evident whether
our intervention had disturbed their breeding urge or the birds would
continue to take interest in their nest. Fortunately, the latter turned
out to be the case. . , , , . ,
The female was now very busy lining the nest with the dried grass
during the whole day. The male did not join her in these activities
but with loud cries flew at all birds who approached the wire-mesh
of his new aviary too closely. On the following day (21st February),
also, both birds stayed close to the nest although they did not start
incubating. On 22nd February the second egg was laid and on
22rd February there were three eggs in the nest-hollow and the
behaviour of both birds did not change ; they remained near the
nest and objected very loudly to everything which approached too
close for their liking. This continued until 26th February. When
I entered the Louise Hall in the morning of that day the female
was--contrary to the preceding days--sitting on the nest anc tie
male was, if possible, more aggressive than before.
I stayed nearby for a long time and at last, when the female e
the nest for a very short time, I had the opportunity to look in the
nest-hollow. There were now four eggs in the nest, lying with points
all towards one another. As soon as the female left the nest the ma e
took her place until the female returned and gently pushed him oi 1 .
Before giving a further account of the breeding, I will first give
a more detailed description of the eggs, as follows : ground colour
light olive-grey, very thickly blotched and stained with brown an
reddish-purple, so as nearly to cover the surface, particularly at the
larger end. The axis measures 42-44, diameter 30-31. . .
We took 26th February as the beginning of the incubation period.
Both birds were alternately sitting on the eggs, although the fema e
did most of the brooding. We observed that the birds continually
tried to push each other from the nest, each being very eager to get

an opportunity to incubate the eggs. This continued for some time,
and on 22nd Mhrch I saw that one of the eggs was damaged, but
after we had very carefully taken it away it proved to be clear. On
24th March, after an incubation period of exactly twenty-eight days
(this being the same period as stated by Mathews), one egg was
hatched. The young bird at first stayed under the mother, but later
in the day was seen several times in the little aviary.
The birds continued to incubate the two remaining eggs. On
25th March, however, one egg disappeared, to our great astonishment,
and on 26th March the last egg disappeared also. I did not find
a single bit of these two eggs in the aviary and I am therefore quite
unable to give a reasonable explanation for their disappearance.
Plate I shows the Black-breasted Plover sitting on the nest, a couple
of hours after the hatching of the egg, with one of the eggs showing
in the nest-hollow under the female's breast. The following is the
description of the young Australian Plover in nestling-plumage :--
Yellowish-brown on the upper parts with indistinct spots of sandy
buff; forehead, sides of crown, and nape covered with black and
buff down ; a narrow white line under the eye, continued over ear-
coverts and broadened around the back of the neck ; ear-coverts,
pale brown ; throat, abdomen, and sides of body, white ; tail
composed of down, blackish, tipped with white.
The young bird did very well and took its food, consisting of a
good insectivorous food, rusk, and egg mixed with dried insects,
quite excellently. It proved to be very fond of mealworms, which
at the beginning were cut into small bits but were very soon given
normally, and the agile little youngster took nearly the whole supply
of them, although it must be said that the parents let him have it.
During the night the young bird slept under the female in the nest-
hollow. By day he frequently sought protection under one of his
parents, being then absolutely indifferent whether it be the male or
the female. Anyhow, it must be said that both birds were excellent
parents who looked after their youngster with great care. During
the first days especially, the youngster grew very fast and moved
about very quickly.
Plate II shows how the young Plover has already grown after four
days and is selecting its food with much care.
On 15th April I noticed that around the wing-butts the first
coloration in the white appeared, on the spot where with the adult
bird the white is changing into black. There was no further colouring
to be seen. Bill and legs were still plain lead-grey and the yellowish-
brown colour on head and back was nearly unchanged, although on
the wings the quills were already showing. About a week later, on
24th April, the definite colour pattern on the breast could clearly be
seen. The whole coloration was somewhat brown instead of black

but it was now easy to see which parts would remain white and
which would ultimately become black. The colours of head and
back changed also and became rufous-brown instead of yellowish-
brown, while the little cap on the head was now clearly marked by
a dark rim. On 3rd May the young bird had already attained
three-quarters of its ultimate size, and Plate III gives a good picture
of its appearance at that age. The temporary mesh-wire protection
in the large aviary was now taken away and the Australian Plovers
had again the entire space at their disposal.
On 9th May I saw the youngster for the first time on the wing
and noticed now very clearly that the tail-coverts and the primaries
were brownish-black.
On 12 th May the lobe between the eyes and the base of the bill
began to show. The colour of the skin here is very difficult to define,
but in my opinion it is greyish-beige. At the time ol writing, 16th
May, the youngster is nearly the same in appearance as the adult
bird, only it is somewhat smaller ; the colours are much paler and
consist merely of different shades of brown. The yellow rim around
the eye is missing as well as any colour in the bill and legs, which
are still lead-grey.
Now, at the age of fifty-four days, the youngster behaves completely
as an adult bird and the family relationship is no longer shown. The
parents keep each others' company as usual, but they take no notice
of the youngster. The young bird, in its turn, leaves its paients alone
and moves quite independently about the aviary. Also, towards
evening it does not seek the company ol its parents but finds itself
a suitable place to go to sleep.

DARENTH-HULME, 1956
By Kay Bonner (Southgate, England)
The coldest, longest winter in living memory was followed by the
wettest, most sunless summer of this century. Little wonder then that
recorded breeding successes are few and far between. W ith us it has
certainly been the worst season we have ever experienced.
Our main activity in the early part of the year was the construction
of a large, planted garden aviary. This measures 54 feet by 22 feet,
and is 7 feet high. It was well-planted with a fine assortment of
ornamental flowering shrubs, evergreen bushes, and climbing plants,
but the incessant rain encouraged the growth ol weeds to such an
extent that the whole lay-out was very quickly turned into a veritable
wilderness. This was not what we had planned but the biids simply
revelled in it, which is, of course, the important thing.

The first birds were put in in mid-April, a small selection of British
birds--Siskins, Redpolls, Linnets, Bramble Finches, Yellow Buntings--
followed, as the weather permitted, by numerous reputedly hardy and
half-hardy exotics. At present there are.about 120 birds, mostly in
pairs, enjoying life to the full. The principal are Egyptian Plover ;
Jackson's, Delamere's, Paradise, and Yellow-shouldered Whydahs ;
Common, Bank, Malabar, and Siamese Crested Mynahs ; Chinese
Silky, Amethyst, Purple-headed, and Green Glossy Starlings ; Rosy

amity except when the starlings or mynahs are attempting to breed,
then the Common Mynahs become swaggering bullies. The Purple-
headed Glossy Starlings and various mynahs have had numerous nests ;
young have been hatched but none has been reared beyond about
ten days. The Chinese Painted Quail have reared young, otherwise
the only natural increase has been through the agency of Zebra
Finches, quite a small flock having been reared.
In the main aviaries the breeding results have been exceedingly
poor, probably the less said about them the better. But our very
reliable pair of Pennant's made amends for the shortcomings of other
pairs by, this year, excelling themselves in that they were double-
brooded, rearing nests of three and one ; the young, as usual, leaving
the nest in full adult plumage.
I he chief inmates of the various aviaries are very much the same
as recorded last year, with the exception that the Red-bellied Conures
were transferred to Mrs. G. T. Clark's collection and there were new
additions in Greater Patagonian Conures from Foxwarren Park,
linsch's Conures, and Alexandrine Parrakeets. The Lineolated
Parrakeets stood the cold fairly well, but there were several losses in
the early spring ; another unfortunate loss was the hen Jobi Island
Pigeon which was found dead on eggs.
d he Budgerigars in the escape passage in front of the aviaries have
bred exceedingly well. Whereas last year we had many " runners "
this year, without exception, all the young have been fine, robust
birds. The Java and Barbary Doves have bred to such an extent
we have had to remove dozens of eggs. During the winter we lost
four Javas but no Barbarys. Crested Bronze-wings and Bronze-wings
have reared several pairs of young ones. The fifteen Buffalo Weavers,
reputed to be a very hardy species, failed to live up to their reputation
and all died at intervals during the course of the winter.
The colony of Red-faced Lovebirds started the winter twenty-six
strong, and to our very great surprise only two were lost, and the

colony at present numbers twenty-six. Towards the end of October
there is always considerable activity when they clean out their nests.
Amongst the debris we find numerous eggs and fragments of eggs.
In the spring we supply new peat-filled nesting-barrels and when the
old peat is broken up we usually find other abandoned eggs, making
a total of at least twenty. No young have yet made their appearance
this year.* Last year we thought the very excellent summer might
have been to their liking, but such was not the case ; this year we
hoped the wet conditions would suit them, but seemingly they are
still not satisfied.
The range of aviaries built specially for the Fruit Pigeons are now
tenanted by the six couples of Pied and Green Imperial, so kindly
accommodated by John Yealland at the London Zoo for nearly two
years. No attempts have been made to breed. We find them
extremely difficult to sex and we rather fear we have couples rather
than pairs. Green Imperials are not recommended to anyone likely
to have neighbour-trouble. Their call is a deep, resounding boom,
which has been likened to the croaking of a bull-frog. True, it is
uttered at considerable intervals ; we like it, but some people are
annoyed by even the gentle cooing of doves !
During the past month or so we have rebuilt the pheasant runs
and are now in process of reconstructing the pigeon and bantam pens.
The bird-rooms continue to house many and varied parrakeets :
Nobel Macaws, Senegal Parrots, Meyer's Parrot, Black-headed
Conure, Canary-winged, White-winged, All-green, r l ui and I ovi
Parrakeets, Turquoise-rumped Parrotlet ; nine White-bellied and
three Black-headed Caiques, a Greater Hill Mynah, and a couple
of dozen Red-faced Lovebirds. The house parrots consist of a pair
of Greys, a Brown-headed Parrot, and White-bellied and Black-
headed Caiques.
Finally, mice. Last year at one time we were literally overrun, but
thanks to perseverance with " Warfarin No. 3 " we are now clear
except for an occasional visitant.
* Since the above was written one young one has left the nest, on 5th October.

LONDON ZOO NOTES
ByJ-J. Yealland
Ten birds were brought from south-eastern Asia by David Atten-
borough and Charles Lagus when they returned from their latest
" Zoo Quest ", and these have been presented by the B.B.C. Television
Service. The collection consists of a Bornean Fire-backed Pheasant,
a Turquoise Fairy Bluebird, a Roulroul Partridge, five Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrakeets, and two Black-winged Grackles. The handsome
Bornean Fire-back has not been exhibited here since 1938, and the
Turquoise Fairy Bluebird ( Irena puella turcosa ) is the only one of the
eight different Fairy Bluebirds ever kept here--perhaps the only one

ever imported.
Birds new to the Collection received during the past two months
are a pair of Scintillating Copper Pheasants ( Syrmaticus soemmerringi
scintillans) received in exchange ; a pair of Black-crested Finches
or Pygmy Cardinals ( Lophospingus pusillus ) presented by Mr. J. R.
Newmark ; two Hainan Blue Flycatchers ( Cyornis pallipes hainana),
a Grey-backed Tit [Parus cinereus commixtus), and a Lanceolated
Babbler [Babax lanceolatus) presented by Dr. K. C. Searle, who also
sent a Black-necked Grackle, four Blood-breasted Pigeons, a Chinese
Dial Bird, a White-browed Jay-Thrush, a Masked Jay-Thrush, a
Wallace's Fruit Pigeon, and two Black-crested Cuckoo-Falcons.
Other presentations include a Malaysian Black-naped Oriole, a
Chinese Jay-Thrush, and a Golden-fronted Barbet ( Cyanops armillaris),

also known as the Orange-banded or Blue-crowned Barbet, sent from
Johore Bahru by Mr. G. Newmark ; a Hooded Vulture sent from the
Gold Coast and a young Spotted Flycatcher that was found with an
injured wing.
Eight Ruffs have been received from Comte Leon Lippens as a gift
to the Norfolk Naturalists' Trust for the purpose of releasing in the
Cley Marshes early next spring, and in the hope that they will perhaps
induce some of the passing migrants to stop and breed there. This is
not the first time that the Society has helped such a project, for in
1939 four Ruffs from the Collection were released in Norfolk, but
what happened on that occasion I do not know. Ruffs formerly bred
in many places in England, and sometimes single birds or small
parties stay for the summer nowadays.
A pair of Ruby-throated Humming Birds were received in exchange,
and another Gallinule has been bred in the Great Aviary, but it is
too early to tell whether it is a true Grey-headed or whether, as last
year, the Green-backed is the father. The triangle is an amiable one,
for it was sometimes possible to see a Grey-headed sitting on the nest
with the other Grey-headed, and the Green-backed sitting close by,
and all three guard the young one. Last year's bird is very like the
Green-backed in plumage.
In the same aviary a pair of Crested Screamers are nesting, but it
is, of course, too late in the year to hope for a successful breeding.
At the Bird House the Black Crakes brought from Sierra Leone in
1954 have nested again, hatching three chicks on 22nd September.
Two died at an early age, but the third is thriving and growing fast.
Both parents take great care of the chick, providing it with food held
in their beaks and, during the earlier stages of its life, whenever the
family was out in the flight, one parent brooded the chick while the
other brought nesting material for its greater comfort. 1 his Crake
(Limnocorax jlavirostra) is common in suitable habitats over much of
Africa southward of the Sahara.

After the Loyal Toast the Chairman said it gave her very great
pleasure to welcome one of the Society's Vice-Presidents and most
distinguished members, Jean Delacour. By a happy chance it
happened to be his birthday. The response to the toast to his health
was vociferous. The Chairman then presented a Club birthday cake,
the cutting of which was accompanied by the usual, somewhat
unmusical, vocal birthday refrain.

Monsieur Delacour, with Gallic charm, thanked the members for
their kind remembrance and said it gave him the greatest pleasure to
be amongst them once more.
The Chairman then welcomed four distinguished aviculturists from
California : Mr. and Mrs. Eric C. Kinsey, of Marin County, and
Mr. and Mrs. William J. Sheffler, of Los Angeles. Mr. Sheffler had
celebrated his birthday the previous day and as Sir Crawford
McCullagh, Bart., had done likewise his name was coupled with the
toast to the overseas visitors. Mr. Sheffler, on behalf of his fellow
visitors, thanked the members for their very warm welcome.
In introducing Mr. and Mrs. Darnton the Chairman said that all
members who had had the pleasure of seeing their film " From
Hippos to Sunbirds '' were looking forward with lively anticipation
to the screening of their latest coloured film " From Flamingos to
Rhinos ". In this they would certainly not be disappointed for the
later film was, if possible, even better than the previous one.
After the showing the large audience signified by sustained applause
that it had really appreciated the skill, time, effort, and, by no means
least, expense Mr. and Mrs. Darnton had devoted to the making of
this unique film.
The next meeting of the Club is on Tuesday 27th November,
1956.
Arthur A. Prestwich,
Hon. Secretary.
Mr. Darnton has kindly written the following synopsis of the
film :--
Our five months' safari in Africa--from the end of November to
April--took us over 10,400 miles through Ruanda Urundi, the Belgian
Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Northern Tanganyika. Unfortunately,
most of the time we had very bad weather, especially in Kenya and
Tanganyika, where although it was the so-called dry season we had
deluges of rain almost daily, which meant flooded rivers and
impassable tracks. However, in spite of these drawbacks, we managed
to bring home over 7,000 feet of colour film of birds and beasts of
which " From Flamingoes to Rhinos is a part.
Most of the 1,600 feet shown was taken in the Rift Valley in
Kenya, the opening shot being of Mount Kenya itself, its peaks
capped with perpetual snow. The soda lakes, which lie cradled along
the valley's floor, are the favourite feeding grounds of the Lesser
Flamingoes which crowd in great rosy drifts along their shallow margins
or fly, like living flames, over their calm blue waters. To see and to
photograph these strange and lovely birds in their vast multitudes is
an unforgettable experience as they are surely one of the greatest
wonders of the bird world.

The crater lake of Naivasha, deep and circular, and widely fringec
with reeds and papyrus, is also of great interest, and here we filmec
all sorts of birds, such as Terns, Pochards, Heron, Knob-billed Geese
a Jacana with her eggs on a floating lily pad, and a mating pair o
Red-knobbed Coots--all against a background of blue waterlilies. Tht
mating of the Coots makes an interesting record, as the female helc
her head under water while the male was on her back. At Naivashs
we also photographed the Superb Spreos, one of the most colourfu
and locally common birds of Kenya.
While in the Marsabit Reserve we were fortunate in finding a nest
of the Red-billed Hornbill, the nest-hole being about 15 feet from
the ground and luckily fairly well lit. When we discovered it the
parents were busily feeding their young through a slit in the tree
trunk, which at its widest was only an inch across. Female Hornbilk
are incarcerated in the nest-hole during incubation and until the
young reach a certain age, by the entrance hole being walled up with
mud, the female assisting the male at this voluntary imprisonment.
In this case the female had evidently only recently emerged, as she
occupied herself, when not feeding her young, in flying back and
forth to a near-by river where, hopping along the water's edge, she
dug up lumps of wet mud with her beak, with which she proceeded
to plaster up a large crack at the back of the tree that had evidently
formed the entrance to the nest. While she was doing this, the cocl
spent his time in searching the ground for grubs and caterpillars,
using his long curved beak as a lever to turn over the dried lumps oi
elephant droppings and also to dig, with a swinging motion, the soft
earth under the trees. With the results of his labours dangling from
the tip of his bill, he flew either to the slit to pass in the food to the
nestlings, or round to the other side of the tree where the hen was
busy at her plastering, to present her with a little sustenance. We
were particularly pleased at getting pictures of all these activities as
we believe that this sequence had never previously been filmed. The
reel ends with some shots of a male Ground Hornbill, a huge grotesque
looking bird, black with red wattles, stalking through the grass.
The second reel opens with the head and shoulders of a giraffe,
and presently as it moves we see several Red-billed Oxpeckers clinging
to its head and neck with close-ups of the birds themselves.
A breeding colony of White-fronted Bee-eaters, and Penduline Tits
constructing their felt-like nest, are followed by an unusual picture ol
a magnificent Bateleur Eagle, its wings outspread like a white cross,
as it dries its feathers after a shower of rain. Hundreds of migrating
Storks, White-backed and European, are next seen, the latter com-
pletely blocking our road as our car drives slowly through them.
One night we heard a tremendous bellowing from fighting hippos
in a near-by lake, and next day we found the corpse of one of the

ontestants floating near the shore. In the flank was a hole where
&gt;ne of the huge teeth of the opponent had pierced the thick hide,
ind this hole was a great attraction for a number of White-backed
/ultures which took it in turn to " have a bite " ! A small crowd
&gt;f these ugly, but useful, birds were hanging about near the water's
'dge, and here we photographed a scene which seems to prove that
it least some birds have a sense of fun, for among the vultures were
wo or three White-necked Ravens who were amusing themselves by
neaking up behind the unsuspecting vultures and tweaking their
ails ! Further along the shore depressed-looking Marabou Storks
Daraded with their wings outstretched, accompanied by a crowd of
vVood Ibis.
This year, after many days of searching, we at last found the nest
n some thick bushes of the spectacular Red-breasted Shrike. These
oirds are very shy and difficult to photograph, but after many hours
bf patient waiting we managed to get some quite good pictures of
:he male and female at the nest.

Lloyd B. Thompson, British Columbia, writes : " We have had a
wonderful summer this year, and the birds have done quite well.
The pair of Turquoisines raised eight in two nests, the Bourkes seven,
the Lineolated six, and the lutino Ringnecks three. The warm weather
helped us to raise dozens of finches."

Last year the eyes of field-ornithologists were focused on a quarry
in East Sussex where Bee-eaters successfully reared young. This year
the focal point has been changed to an old barn in the Hampshire
village of Nether Wallop. Here, in a hole in the chalk wall, a pair of
Hoopoes successfully reared one young one.
First the Bee-eater, now the Hoopoe. Will next year be the turn
of the Osprey ? Both last year and this one pair nested unsuccessfully
in Scotland. It is to be hoped it will be a case of third time lucky.

AVIARIES, BIRDROOMS, AND CAGES. By L. P. Luke and
Allen Silver, F.Z.S. Published by Cage Birds and Poultry
World, Ltd., London, 1955. Price js. 6 d. net.
The fact that this is the sixth edition of this book is evidence in
itself of the great demand there is for the information it contains.
The names of the authors alone are sufficient incentive to buy the
book in order to gain from their wide experience. This new edition
has been completely revised and brought up to date and is most com-
prehensive. It contains advice not only for those who wish to construct
their own aviaries but also to those who prefer to buy them, and
information on types for particular purposes is included, also methods
of blending enclosures with the surrounding garden, and preparing
the site. Cages, appliances, and utensils are described, and the
value of the book is enhanced by thirty-eight black and white photo-
graphic illustrations and forty-eight line drawings.

LE SERIN DES CANARIES. By Marcel Legendre. Editions

N. Boubee &amp; Cie, Paris. 1955. Price 810 francs net.
Monsieur Legendre's two previous books in this series, on cage birds
in general, and on budgerigars, were reviewed in the May-June, 1953,
and September-October, 1954, numbers respectively, and the present
work on canaries maintains the high standard of its predecessors. The
book opens with a full account of the history of the Canary and how
it came to be given this name, the description of the first importations
into Europe being particularly interesting. The author then proceeds
to give full information regarding varieties and races, and continues
with a section on breeding ; this includes details of the care that
should be taken with regard to the birds' welfare in order to induce
them to breed, the cage, feeding utensils, and other appliances, and
numerous suggested menus. Advice is given on how to deal with
various maladies, the moult, nervous attacks and accidents in laying.
The two final chapters of the book are devoted to hybridization and
to artificial colouring by means of special feeding ; but, as Prince Paul
Murat states in the Introduction : " Serins whose colours are obtained
naturally by selection, crossing, or hybridization are the most beautiful.
It is normal to give them food containing vitamins in order to enhance
their colours, but to tint them, or endeavour to change their colours
by drastic methods should be forbidden."
The book is illustrated with thirty-four line drawings, thirteen photo-
graphs by G. Vermande, and two colour plates by L. Delapchier.
The text is concisely and clearly written, and should not be difficult
for English readers to understand.

A review of this work was given in the Avicultural Magazine,

Now sections 10-16 inclusive have appeared and deal with twenty-
seven species. As in previous sections there is a black and white
illustration of each species described, but in the sections under review
a number of actual photographs of the birds, by Nicolai, are included,
which are an improvement on the line drawings. In addition there
are three colour plates, each depicting several different species of
Waxbills of India, Java and Australia. The text is right up to date

Research project concerned with the hybridization of surface-feeding ducks
The Conservation Department of Cornell University is conducting a research
project concerned with hybridization in surface-feeding ducks, including the
Mallard, Pintail, Black Duck, Gadwall, Green-winged Teal, Blue-winged Teal, and
Shoveller. The purpose of this study is to obtain further information on the relation-
ships within this controversial group, using behavioral data, relative fertility
determinations, and possibly other physiological techniques. It is hoped that the
greatest possible number of hybrid crosses among these species may be studied,
and we are in need of first generation male hybrids of known parentage for this
purpose. Any aviculturist who happens to possess such birds, and who is willing
to lend them to the Department for this project could assist us greatly. It would be
appreciated if interested persons would contact Charles G. Sibley or Paul A.

A Natural Colour Variety of the Red-eared Waxbill
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.923587375" page_id="58073154"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
About a year ago I came across a colour variety of the Red-eared Waxbill (Estrilda
astrild). It was shown to me by a dealer who had found it in a newly-imported
consignment. I was not able to buy it and assumed that whoever had purchased
it would make it known, but having heard nothing of it I feel it might deserve
a mention.
On head, mantle, and wings it lacked the normal pinkish or greyish tint and was
instead a warm, light brown. The breast and flanks were sandy-buff and as far
as I recall the tail was the usual black edged with white. The most conspicuous
points about it were the streak through the eye and the patch on the belly, which
in the normal bird are scarlet. In this specimen they were a pure orange colour.
I regret that I did not remember the colour of the bill.
As far as I know no colour varieties have previously been recorded in this species,
and this one, which appears to have been of the " cinnamon " type, suggests that
there may be interesting possibilities of colour breeding in the Estrildine Waxbills.

By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
" The trading vessels continually bring away considerable numbers
in cages : but they are so tender that most of them die in their passage
to our colder climates. It has also been remarked that many of them
have dropped down dead through timidity at the firing of a vessel's
great guns."
So wrote the Rev. Thomas Smith in 1806.
It has certainly been our experience that when newly imported
the Red-faced is incomparably the least hardy and most timid of all
the lovebirds known to Aviculture. Newly imported birds are very
subject to cerebral haemorrhage, brought on by fright. In spite of
exercising every possible care we have, at various time, lost dozens.
The sudden opening of a door or window, the entry of a visitor to
the bird-room, even a quick movement has proved quite sufficient to
cause a fatality. We have often marvelled that any manage to reach
these shores alive.
The Red-faced, alone amongst the lovebirds, is invariably im-
ported with the flight-feathers of one wing cut : this is often done with
such carelessness that the wing itself is mutilated. It used to be
recommended that the stumps of the quills should be removed--one
or two at a time, repeating the operation about once a week until all
are removed. We would hesitate to follow such a recommendation.
The shock of handling alone would more than likely prove fatal to a
bird already very considerably debilitated by the rigours of trapping
and importation, coupled with injudicious treatment generally. In
the past we have had hundreds of Red-faced, all too many have been
short-lived, but survivors have invariably been allowed to moult the
stubs naturally. In addition, no attempt has ever been made to induce
a false moult.

Many aviculturists have had good pairs of adult birds in hard
condition. Why then do they not breed with them ? The main
trouble appears to be that the ordinary aviculturist has a somewhat
defeatest attitude towards this species. He knows that the majority
of the imported lovebirds are comparatively free-breeders and that
the Red-faced has a very bad reputation in this respect, having rarely
got much beyond the laying of eggs. He argues there must be some
very good reason : and instead of trying, let alone persevering, he
tries his luck with birds that are, by general consent, more likely tc
prove breeders. He cannot be blamed, for, after all, most aviculturists
are limited as regards aviary space, and we all do like to breed birds !
I have been keeping this little parrakeet almost continuously foi
nearly thirty-five years. During the past four years especially, th(
effort to breed it has been both extensive and sustained, and it is the
events of this period that I propose to detail. Let me here say tha
the many years, with their seemingly endless disappointments, have a
long-last proved rewarding in that we have now reared a single
young one.
In the early part of 1953 we constructed what we hoped woulc
prove an acceptable aviary, providing the very necessary seclusion
being such timid birds it is absolutely essential that they should enjo^
a sense of security. It measures 24 ft. by 18 ft. by 7 ft. 6 in. high ; the
materials being \ in. wire-netting and larch poles. Three sides are
totally enclosed and the fourth, the one with the gate, three-quarter
enclosed with sheets of asbestos. The roof is covered with asbesto
sheets to a width of 4 feet on the north side, and 2 feet on the thre&lt;
others. The enclosure contains a shelter 8 ft. by 3 ft., raised 3 feet fron
the ground, and seven or eight nut-bushes. At the outset four full-sizi
bales of peat-moss were mounted on staging in the centre of the aviary
But this did not prove a success and, as will be seen later, we ha(
recourse to a method somewhat similar to that originated by Edwan
Boosey and used by him in his experiments before the war.
The 18th May, 1953, dawned bright and clear, and with the weathe
forecast " Fine, with long, sunny spells we judged the time ha(
come to introduce our small flock. Ten specially selected pairs wen
released and all proved to be strong fliers. They very quickly settlec
down, but in the afternoon there was torrential rain, during which th
entire flock remained out ! Fortunately, and to our great surprise
there were no ill-results. During the next few months there wer
several deaths, and as bird-room birds moulted and became full
winged they were added to the community to make good the losses
From the first, great interest was shown in the bales of peat-mos
and soon several pairs were busily engaged excavating holes. Bu
unfortunately they were not content merely to excavate nesting sites
they bored, and with such good purpose that they ran tunnels righ

through the bales--they just didn't know when to stop ! No eggs
were laid which was, perhaps, just as well.
Came October with slight ground frosts and on the 7th we judged
the time had come to bring them in for the winter. The catching up
of birds in a largish aviary is at no time easy. I am not particularly
good with a net and so, albeit with many qualms, I entrusted the
operation to two well-known experts, who must of necessity remain
nameless. But put not your trust in experts ! These two could not
have been more inexpert and were quite incapable of appreciating
the delicacy of their task and, in spite of my explicit instructions and
frequent exhortations to exercise the greatest care, caught them up
regardless of everything and damn the consequences. The result was
very much worse than anything even I had foreseen. Twenty birds
were caught up and within a week half of our precious stock had died
from concussion, cerebral haemorrhage, and pneumonia consequent on
shock. As can be well-imagined it was a very distressing and dis-
couraging experience.
We still had a number of birds in various stages of moult, and during
the next few months we were able by various and devious means to
buy in a couple of dozen or so newly imported birds. Then started a
further series of losses, all the old causes, but by the end of April, 1954,
we had 31 good birds, including 10 from the previous year,
ready for turning out. In the meantime the bales of peat-moss had
been replaced by eight large grape barrels, approximately 34 inches
deep by 14 inches across the mouth, which had been filled with wet
peat-moss, rammed hard. Then on nth May, a glorious day with a
temperature of 82* F., we turned out the flock. Within an hour a very
fine male managed to hang itself in the fork of a bush, and next
morning a male and a female were picked up dead--fractured skulls.
Thenceforth nothing untoward happened.
The barrels proved very acceptable and provided both constant
amusement and outlets for unlimited energy. Several were more or
less seriously " occupied " and at one time we had high hopes, but
month followed month and no young ones made their appearance.
Towards the end of September there was very considerable activity
in the barrels, apparently a sort of autumn cleaning. Fourteen whole
eggs and many fragments were thrown out of the nests. None had
contained a chick, and we were, in fact, unable to determine whether
any had been fertile as all were quite dried up.
As some will remember the summer was not worthy of the name.
The weather having been so poor we considered our flock must have
been well and truly acclimatized to have withstood it. Had the
summer been the type our fathers are said to have enjoyed we would
have hesitated even to consider leaving them out, but having been so
bad we thought that by contrast the winter couldn't be so very much

worse ! This, coupled with the remembrance of the catching-up disastei
of the previous autumn, persuaded us to take a chance and leave then
out, only catching them up if it appeared that the weather really wai
going to prove too much for them. We did, however, catch up twc
females that were poor fliers and left out 26. In the past we hav(
always been concerned when the temperature in the bird-room ha:
dropped below 40* F. But, and we consider this quite remarkable, al
26 came through the very variable and treacherous winter, with th&lt;
temperature on occasions as low as 21 0 F. Even on the very coldes
days, and with thick snow on the ground, they were all in the rudes
health and full of the joy of living. At night some occupied the nesting
barrels, but the majority hung suspended head down under th&lt;
sheltered parts of the roof.
In the early spring, 1955, the old barrels were replaced by other
prepared during the winter. T his time a smaller barrel was used
approximately 14 inches deep and 12 inches across the mouth. Th
number was increased to a dozen and they were hung facing nortl
and west.
When we broke up the old nests we found that in general the burrow
extended on a slight incline to a depth of perhaps six or seven inche
and then opened up on one side into a nesting chamber about th
size of a largish orange. In no case did the burrows turn verticall
and then double back so that the nesting chamber was more or les
above the entrance hole--as has been stated on occasions. No nestin
material of any kind had been carried into any nest.
The task of excavating falls mainly to the females. T he males sho^
great enthusiasm but are more of a hindrance than any real help
They burrow into the peat with the greatest of ease and since w
have used the barrels we are not aware that any has got into diff
culties on account of an excavation caving in. When we used the bale
of peat we did have one fatality--a female that somehow becam
wedged about nine inches along an open tunnel.
Early in 1955 a young male managed to crack its skull, and durin
a warm spell the two poor flying females were restored to the avian
so that we started the season with a complement of 27*
The summer proved to be the best and certainly the warmest fc
many years, and as week followed week of almost unbroken sunshin
our hopes rose. We felt there was a really good chance of succes
That they had wintered out proved they must be in first rate condition
this coupled with the glorious weather led us to believe that the
would now breed, if ever. About ten pairs burrowed, several appeare
to be serious in their intent. There was much mating, over twent
eggs it later transpired, but no young. There is some variation in tl
size of the eggs, 20-21 X 16-17 mm. ; 20 X 16 mm. being a fa
average.

On the 3rd December a " stranger " appeared in the aviary,
hanging on the netting, apparently unable to fend for itself. We
brought it into the house where it remained caged until the spring,
when it was returned to the enclosure. Several authorities examined
it and pronounced it to be a young one. We would like to think it was
a home-bred bird, but we haven't the faintest clue to its origin, so we
have recourse to the Scottish verdict " Not proven ". It has developed
nto quite a nice little female but still retains a somewhat juvenile
appearance.
It is very remarkable, but in recent years both summers and winters
invariably establish or break records of one kind or another. A record-
breaking summer was naturally followed by a record-breaking winter :
days and nights of pitiless frost with the temperature on one occasion
down to 15 0 F. The flock was again left out and successfully withstood
this, the worst winter of the century. The losses were negligible : one
female was found dead egg-bound on 25th November, and one in
late December for no ascertainable cause.
We now come to the year 1956. We suffered an invasion of mice
during the previous year : only comparatively few got into the
lovebird enclosure and, as far as we know, none managed to climb
up to the barrels. We eventually entirely cleared the aviaries of these
pests and took all reasonable precautions to prevent a repetition of
the nuisance. In the spring sheets of galvanized iron were sunk in
the ground, leaving 18 inches above ground. The staging was
reconstructed and we are now confident it is virtually impossible for
any mouse to gain entrance to a barrel. The new lay-out enabled the
number of barrels to be increased to sixteen, eight facing north and
eight west.
It could hardly be expected that we should enjoy two successive
good summers. And so it came as no great surprise that the summer
of 1956 proved to be one of the worst for quite a few years : sunless,
cheerless, wet, with cold nights. There cannot have been more than
nine or ten real summer days during the whole period.
Matters went very much as in previous years, matings, excavatings,
and more matings. The weather was really so poor that no breeding
results could reasonably be expected.
It is said that one of the main attractions of Aviculture is its very
uncertainty. True or false it is definitely very uncertain ! During the
many years in which we have engaged in the " Amiable Art " we
have experienced many trials and tribulations, mixed, be it said,
with just a few joys and triumphs. We now enjoyed one of the rare
triumphs, really quite an unexpected one.

been seen for some weeks was in very poor condition and miserable
looking, too. Both of them did little except sit close against each othei
with their beaks tucked into their shoulders. The male was invariable
in attendance, sitting on the other side and giving general support tc
the young one. At frequent intervals the young one bestirred itsel
and begged for food, with drooping wings slightly open and quivering
at the same time " bleating " incessantly--a like performance neve
witnessed by us with any other Agapornis species. Fortunately th&lt;
male was always willing to oblige, for the female most certainh
didn't appear as though she were capable of feeding herself, let alont
assisting with even a single young one. The temperature that nigh
dropped to near frost and we were far from hopeful of the survival o
either, especially as they did not retire to the barrel but roosted on th"
top of it. However, survive they did. The next four or five days the'
spent huddled together, two very dejected looking little creatures
but as they were able to fly and day followed day we became les
pessimistic, more so as the nights had become markedly less cold
Then after about a week there was a decided improvement in thei
appearance. The male no longer remained in such close attendance
but was always within easy reach and ever on the alert to drive ol
any other bird that ventured too near his family. For the next montl
it was quite usual to see all three sleeping close together. They wer
not actually seen to re-enter the barrel but they may have done so a
one of their favourite perches was, and still is, on the peat retainini
board fastened to the front.
On leaving the nest the young one was, as already stated, in a ver
soft condition. In colouring it is a washed-out replica of a female
the green is dull, entirely lacking the beautiful, vivid sheen of an adult
the yellow-orange of the forehead, face, and throat is paler and les
extensive ; beak a pale brownish-orange ; rump bright blue but paler
under wing-coverts green, sparsely feathered ; tail as in an adult bu
shorter and the colouring paler. The general impression is that whe
it moults it will prove to be a female ; this is heightened by the fac
that there are no black feathers in the under wing-coverts.
Food. Our Red-faced colony lives almost entirely on soaked mille
sprays and soft, sweet apples. White millet, pannicum, and canar
seed are always available, but they are rarely, if ever, touched. 1
should be mentioned, in passing, that to our great cost we have foun
it most inadvisable to give soaked millet sprays to newly importe
birds. They gorge themselves and seem quite unable to assimilate i'
The sprays, apples, and cuttle-bone are hung on the netting and tb
other seeds, water, and grit are supplied on a table. There is therefor
no necessity for them to descend to the ground and it is indeed quit
exceptional to see any do so. But very occasionally about half a doze
may be surprised fossicking about, usually amongst the peat-moss ths

has fallen during the course of excavation. We are quite unable
to account for the fact that these little parties always appear to be
composed of males only. The ground of the aviary is overgrown with
weeds of all kinds and there is also much sprouting seed, but none
ever seems of interest : certainly we have never seen a lovebird so
much as nibbling chickweed or anything else, so we do not think
green food in any form was used in the rearing of our young one.
A few details still need to be filled in. Only one young one left the
nest but it is extremely unlikely that the clutch consisted of only one
egg. We can only assume that, in conformity with several other
nests, the number was between four and six. We may perhaps
know more of this when the barrel is replenished with peat-moss. It is
the same with the incubation period, we surmise it to have been
20-21 days, but of this we have no confirmation.
During all this time there were Diamond Doves and Chinese
Painted Quail in the enclosure, but their breeding operations, and the
Quail were remarkably successful, in no way interfered with the
lovebirds and the lovebirds in turn appeared to be quite unaware of
their presence.
Any member specially interested in this species is very welcome to
come, preferably by appointment, and see our " breeding " colony.
And, please, no post cards enquiring whether we are certain our
Lovebirds are Red-faced and not Peach-faced. We really do know
the difference !
The sequel is very unfortunate. The night of 6th November had a
slight ground frost accompanied by light fog. The combination was
apparently just too much for the young one and in the morning it was
breathing heavily. We caught it up as a precautionary measure. Its
condition did not at first give rise to any great anxiety, but it deterio-
rated very rapidly and within a few hours it was dead. It died on
the thirty-fourth day after leaving the nest and was quite independent
of its parents.
The post-mortem examination carried out at the Zoo showed that
the cause of death was pneumonia, and confirmed that, as expected,
the young one was a female.
As described above, A. A. Prestwich has bred the Red-faced Love-
bird (Agapornis pullaria ). It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

By P. M. A. Harwood, M.R.C.V.S. (Darlington, Western Australia)
The Pileated Parrakeet, known in Australia as the Red-capped or
West Australian King Parrot, is a most interesting bird. A member
of the Bassian fauna of south-west Australia, the bird has no close
generic relatives. Generally speaking the Bassian fauna of the south-
west is represented by an identical or similar and related fauna in
the Bassian region of Eastern Australia, an indication of a previous
connection across the existing barren Eyrean region which now acts
as an effective barrier against eastwards and westwards migrations
(see Map i).
Map i. --Hatched areas show the Bassian Areas of S.W. and S.E. Australia.
The Pileated Parrakeet is a bird with a limited range in the south-
western corner of Western Australia. It is limited in distribution to
the Jarrah and Karri forest areas, the south-west coastal plain, and
has made some limited extensions into the white gum forests and
mallee areas and along the south coast (see Map 2.)

P. M. A. HARWOOD-THE PILEATED PARRAKEEt
The author feels that this is not the true relationship. It is true
that the bird shows several of the general characteristics of the
Platycercine Parrakeets, but these characteristics are also seen in the
small Broadtails (genus Psephotus and related genera which include
Red-rumped, Many-coloured, and Blue-bonnet Parrakeets).
More weight can, I feel, be given to the argument that the Pileated
is a bird which has followed a lone evolutionary development. That
this development has occurred from Broadtail stock is suggested on
morphological grounds, on the characteristic exhibition of a row of white
dots on the under surface of the flight feathers in immature plumage,
and on the striking resemblance of the calls of young Pileateds
to the very similar normal calls of the Platycercines generally.
As evidence against the bird being a progenitor of Broadtail stock,
two characteristics of the group as a whole are quite different in the
Pileated. The sexual display is quite unlike that of any other Broad-
tail and the calls of the mature birds are also strikingly dissimilar.
The beak shows a remarkable evolutionary development. The
peculiar elongation of the upper mandible is seen in only three other
Australia psittacines--the Slender-billed Corella, the race tenuirostris
of Baudin's Black Cockatoo (both these forms occur in south-west
Australia), and the rare Blue-cheeked Parrakeet of North Queensland
(Hallstrom (3)).
That the bird itself is in a process of evolutionary change is suggested
by the fact that, whereas some females exhibit a similar, though duller,
plumage to adult males, others never progress beyond the dull
juvenile plumage of the immature. This phenomenon may even be
seen in females from the same nest.
This description of the bird, given by the Duke of Bedford (3), is
so comprehensive that I can add little to it.
" Adult male. Cap dark crimson ; cheeks bright greenish-yellow ;
mantle and wings green ; under wing-coverts, outer edge of wing,
and portion of flight feathers blue. Rump yellow with a greenish
tinge. Central tail feathers green, darkening towards the tip. Outer tail
feathers blue and white. Breast purple. Vent and under tail-coverts
red. Bill bluish horn and peculiarly long and narrow. Total length
14^ inches. Size about that of a pigeon.
" Adult female. Very variable. Some hens, except for a few green
feathers on the cap and a duller shade on the cheeks, have the same
plumage as the male. Others, even sisters in the same nest as the
bright form, never acquire a plumage very different from the immature,
save that they are a little more purple on the breast.
Immature. Head and upper parts a dull, dark green, slightly paler
on the cheeks ; bastard-wing, primary coverts, and outer edge of flight
feathers blue ; rump greenish-yellow. Middle tail feathers bronze-
green. A narrow bar of red across the forehead. Throat and foreneck

dusky grey with a slight reddish tinge on the breast. Abdomen
pale, purplish-blue. Lower flanks and thighs apple green, the feathers
margined with red. Under tail-coverts similar but paler and inclining
to yellow. Adult plumage is acquired with the first complete moult
when the bird is a little less than a year old."
Females can always be picked from males in full colour as in the
former the cap is always more maroon than crimson.
The species is subject to a certain amount of erythrism and some
birds show a red edging to the yellow feathers of the rump. There is
also a considerable variation in the amount of blue in the wings and
in the depth of purple in the breast of males. It is a remarkable
thing that such garish colours combine into a very effective camouflage.
Birds seen at a distance appear a uniform, inconspicuous greyish-green
and it is not easy to differentiate between immature and coloured
birds in the field.
The one conspicuous feature of the Pileated in flight is the yellow
rump and this feature is the one by which the bird can be quickly
differentiated in the bush. The flight of the Pileated is quite
characteristic and is composed of a series of undulatory glides inter-
spersed by ten to twelve rapid wing beats. It is a swift and agile bird.
The range of the Pileated has already been described. Within this
range, the bird has adapted itself well to changes in environment
caused by the advance of agriculture and, in spite of persecution by
man, is in no immediate danger of extinction.
In some areas the birds are " declared " as vermin on account of
the damage they inflict to orchards, and nowhere are they protected
by law. Even in King's Park, in the heart of Perth, it is not unusual
to see a few Pileated Parrakeets, and there can be few suburban
gardeners who have not had their almond trees raided at some time.
However, on account of the very effective camouflage, few people
recognize the birds and most of these depredations are blamed on
the " Twenty-eights ".
The Pileated is a tree lover and keeps to the forests and belts of
trees. The " parkland " type of clearing with the retention of trees
for shade and shelter have suited the birds, while they have been
quick to turn to their advantage the introduction of many new and
edible flora species.
The natural foods comprise the seeds of various eucalypts, chiefly
red gum, white gum, and jarrah ; the seeds of sheokes (Casuarina
spp.), banksias, native pears, and various other native trees and shrubs
and grass seeds. Like most parrakeets, the nectar of flowering
eucalypts is also relished.
Introduced foods for which the birds show a liking are oats and
wheat, apples, pears and stone fruits, almonds, pine cones, and the
seeds of many of the introduced pasture plants.

P. M. A. HARWOOD-THE PILEATED PARRAKEET
The breeding season is approximately between October and
December, but birds on the coastal plain usually nest about a month
in advance of those on the Darling Range escarpment. The nest site is
a hollow in a tree seldom less than 40 feet from the ground. Red
gums, jarrahs, and white gums are selected as nest trees and the birds
show a preference for hollows which face east to north.
Green trees are almost invariably selected, but the type of nest
site shows considerable variation. There is usually a preference for
sites with a small entry hole and this often shows signs of chewing.
Some nests are at the level of the entry hole, others descend a
considerable amount. One nest was found where the eggs were laid
15 feet below the entry hole.
From five to seven eggs form the normal clutch and incubation
takes approximately twenty-four days. The female alone incubates,
being fed by the male. He usually flies to a near-by tree and calls
the female off the nest to be fed. She returns immediately to the
nest. Feeding times are usually 8 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. For about two
weeks before the young birds are ready to fly they can be heard
calling for food at these times. The call is a prolonged double whistle,
the second note being about three tones higher pitched than the first.
All the young birds normally leave the nest on the same day and
are fed by their parents for about another fortnight. During this
period they utter the double-whistle call almost incessantly and will
fly to any adult, even a stranger, demanding to be fed. Nesting
territories are rigidly guarded and both members of a pair act in
unison to repel an invader. Mated pairs fly together, but young
birds congregate into loosely integrated flocks when independent of
their parents. These flocks lack the close integration and discipline
of the flocks formed by young Rock Pebblers.
Towards the end of winter, birds congregate into large flocks of all
ages and both sexes, often around farms and other places where there is
a ready food supply. These flocks suddenly disperse with the advent
of spring when the birds again fly in individual pairs and start to
dispute over nesting sites.
Depending on seasonal conditions, these large winter flocks may
last for months or only a few weeks.
There are three basic call notes of the Pileated Parrakeet. The
first and most often heard call is a harsh grating cry frequently
reiterated and of short duration and usually uttered in flight. The
alarm call is a variation of this. The second call could be likened
to " Kililililik This call is usually uttered when the bird is
perching.
There is also the double-whistle call of the young bird, also
uttered by females wishing to be fed by their mates.
In addition, males when displaying often make a clicking noise,

apparently with the beak, and when a number of newly-trapped birds
are confined in an aviary they dispute roosting sites with a peculiar

<bodyText confidence="0.997393076923077" page_id="58073185"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
Males exhibit a display quite unlike that of the Platycercine
Parrakeets. The feathers on the cap are erected and the tail is shaken
vertically, never horizontally. Hens out of the breeding season are
far more dominating than is usual with Broadtails. Both members
of the pair prospect for nesting-sites with much excitement, calling,
and tail-shaking, but under normal conditions the male never actually
enters the nest.
Males are assiduous in feeding females during courtship, with the
normal head-bobbing movements and regurgitation. Copulation takes
place on a fairly wide branch or limb with the female remaining
crouched through the pre-copulatory ceremony. Females will solicit
copulation by adopting this crouched posture and slightly vibrating
the wings.

Methods of Trapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950049230769231" page_id="58073185"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
The Pileated is a very intelligent and active bird and is far harder
to trap than most parrakeets. Basically there are three periods when
trapping is possible :--
(1) When young birds are not fully independent of their parents
they are much attracted by the calls of any mature birds.
(2) When the nesting-site selection is taking place, any strange
Pileated will be attacked by a pair which have selected their nesting
territory.
(3) During the period when winter flocks are formed food supplies
are usually short and the birds can be trapped on grain.
Like many parrakeets, Pileateds show a reluctance to leave an
injured companion ; in fact, the cries of an injured bird will attract
others.

14 D. M. WEST - NESTING OF PILEATED PARRAKEET IN CALIFORNIA
The Pileated Parrakeet as an Aviary Bird
By virtue of its brilliant and unusual coloration and active
disposition, the Pileated makes an attractive aviary bird. On the
negative side of the balance it must be stated that it is very wild
and seldom becomes even reasonably steady. Hand-reared birds are
very friendly and docile and make fairly talented talkers. Its wildness
is compensated somewhat by its agility and the birds rarely injure
themselves in aviaries once they have come to accept wire-netting as
an impassable barrier. For this reason, it is essential to cage newly-
trapped birds in small, roofed cages until they get used to netting,
otherwise head injuries are common and severe. It needs a fairly
large aviary to be seen to advantage.
The basic food is three parts sunflower, two parts oats, and one
part canary seed. Most pairs will consume a whole apple daily and
require a good deal of greenstuff.
The species nests quite readily in an aviary, being single-brooded.
When young are being reared an abundance of fruit, soft grass, green
peas, lettuce, soaked bread, and boiled maize are essential. Like most
Australian parrakeets, it is quite impossible to expect good results
where the young are to be reared on hard seed. Interference and
inspection of the nest is resented and hens even desert young if
interfered with. Males are quite tolerant of the presence of their
young, but breeding pairs can be very aggressive towards other birds.
Several hybrids have been produced. On record are hybrids with
the Mealy, Common, and Stanley Rosellas.

These striking birds, with their very unusual coloration, are not
favourites with some aviculturists. Their nervous disposition, and
long curved beak, accompanied by a rather bizarre colour scheme
have made them loved by some, disliked by some, and ignored by
many.

D. M. WEST-NESTING OF PILEATED PARRAKEET IN CALIFORNIA I 5
The pair which nested for me in 1955 and again in 1956 were
bred in 1952. The male was in complete colour in 1954, but at that
time the female did not have her red cap, though otherwise com-
pletely coloured. It would appear from this that the male colours
completely in two years, but that the female requires three years to
assume complete adult plumage. I have not seen a previous
reference to this fact, and possibly my experience is only an isolated
case.
Because of their rather nervous disposition this pair were kept in
a 26 ft. long aviary, which was about 3 feet wide and 8 feet high.
The feeding and watering was done at the front and this allowed
them to fly into the shelter while these operations were being carried
out. This arrangement was a good one since the pair were able to
observe the feeding process from a safe distance and learned that
there was nothing to fear, and this has helped to tame them down.
The hand-reared Pileated I have seen and owned were just
as tame and confiding as a Princess Alexandra--but not so their nest-
reared brothers and sisters !
In this flight there was also a pair of Turquoisines. From past
experience Pileated have been found to be very tractable and Bourke's
and other equally inoffensive species are quite happy when housed in
large aviaries with Pileated. Despite their rather formidable-appearing
beaks they are not aggressive with smaller birds and are not destructive
to any but the very softest woods--at least, in my experience.
This particular pair have been in this aviary since 1953. At first
the pair were nervous and flighty, and it took them a full year
to settle down. Gradually the pair became more quiet and acted
quite sensibly whenever I had to clean their aviary, etc.
During the 1954 season the pair became very active and indulged
in a great deal of extra flying and calling. The male appeared more
anxious to nest than the hen, but eventually nothing happened and
the pair fell into an early moult.
In 1955 the male began calling and displaying to the hen in March.
By the end of March both birds were flying about a great deal and
the male was occasionally seen to feed the hen. In April the male
began feeding the hen frequently and the pair were observed mating
on two different occasions in the morning.
It was at this point that events took a rather unexpected turn.
Instead of taking one of the two large boxes especially hung for them
at the rear of the aviary the hen chose the nest-box intended for the
pair of Turquoisines. This was not a large box, being about 12 inches
high, 8 inches deep, and 6 inches wide. To top it all off the hen did
not enter through the entrance hole but instead she entered through
the roof of the box ! This was accomplished quite easily since the
top of this box was split, and by doing a little pushing and nudging

she was able to separate the boards enough to enter. It had never
entered my head that the Pileated would choose this box--which was
hung in the front part of the aviary which the Pileated had always
avoided like the plague ! It might be added that the Turquoisines
were so put out by all this unseemly house hunting that they nested
in one of the large boxes provided for the Pileated.
The hen Pileated did all the house hunting herself, and the cock
never appeared interested in any of the boxes provided. At this time
it was considered unwise to take this small box down--because this
might put the pair off and they would not nest at all--so with my
fingers crossed they were allowed to proceed with their plans.
It was fully expected that the hen would sit like a feather, but she
very agreeably surprised me by sitting very tightly and never coming
off the nest except when absolutely necessary.
After incubation actually started the cock stopped calling and
became very quiet. This seems to be a rather general happening
and I have observed similar behaviour with other species. Doubtless
it is a safeguard to avoid calling attention to the sitting hen.
Babies were heard on the twenty-fourth day after incubation staited,
The cock did not enter the nest-box, but he did feed the hen whenever
she would come off the nest. Sometimes he would fly to the top o:
the nest and look in, and call to the hen, but the cock was never
observed actually to enter the box. Because of the small size of th(
box, and the method of entrance, it was very nearly a physica
impossibility.
The diet while feeding the young was as follows : a dish of mixec
grains (millet, oats, canary, hemp) and a dish of sunflower wa
provided, along with two large dessert apples each day, one orange
and a fresh ear of corn, and all the poa annua and pyracantha benie
available.
For the first few days the young could be heard being fed, an
then from the fifth day on it became apparent that all was not wel
The hen would be off the nest a great deal, and neither bird appearn
interested in the soaked bread, etc., that most parents with a famil
to feed appear anxious for. An inspection ol the nest on the fifth da
revealed that there had been four eggs laid and that three of the egg
had hatched, but that the young had been trampled to death-
doubtless by the fact that the hen had literally to jump down int
the nest from her mode of entrance.
The nest was taken down, and then completely scrubbed with
strong wire brush, dipped into a disinfectant, and hung up agai
after a few days. However, the parents did not appear interested i
the nest and there were no further attempts at nesting.
If this story has a moral it is doubtless centred around the absolul
necessity of having a decent-sized nest-box for birds of this size.

In 1956 the pair reared a single youngster--having the misfortune
to lose four young during a heatwave in May. This was a disappoint-
ment, but possibly in 1957 they will be lucky and rear a family of
more appealing numbers.

THE BREEDING OF THE CUBAN AMAZON
PARROT (Amazona leucocephala)

We have two pairs of Cuban Amazon Parrots at the Keston Foreign
Bird Farm, one of which successfully reared two young ones during
the 1956 breeding season--so far as we know the first time the species
has ever been bred in captivity.
As they are among the more rarely imported Amazons, I give the
following very brief description for the benefit of those who may not
be familiar with their appearance. Bright darkish green with black
sdges to the feathers, these being widest and most pronounced on the
neck and forepart of the body. Face white with a beautiful patch of
deep coral pink on the throat. A considerable amount of vinous
colour on the belly and of rich blue in the wings. Bill, whitish. It is
when the wings are partially opened and the shoulders thrust forward
in display that one can fully appreciate the great beauty of these
Amazons. They are perhaps a trifle smaller and slimmer than the
well-known Blue-front.
We have had the four adults for about four years, and they were
obviously young birds when they arrived, at which time they were
desperately wild, but they have gradually calmed down and are now
quite steady with people they know.
Pair number one were given a hang-up nest-box with natural bark
on the front round the entrance hole and soon started spending quite
long periods inside it. Then they seemed to lose interest, partly,
I think, because their aviary was not in a sufficiently secluded position.
Pair number two, however, were given a grandfather clock type
nest-box, also with natural bark on the front, and soon took to it,
the hen starting to sit about the middle of May.
By the end oi June the parents were eating much more than usual
and on one or two occasions I thought I heard young ones being fed
in the nest, so I was glad that I had already augmented their diet
with a daily allowance of such extras as a cube of stale bread previously
soaked in sweetened milk, as well as boiled potatoes and carrots and

plenty of seakale beet and apples. I also supplied flakes of boiled
white fish, of which our Blue-fronted Amazons were so fond when
rearing young, but it did not seem to appeal to the Cubans, so I
discontinued it.
A couple of weeks or so later I found myself in the dilemma which
must be familiar to those aviculturists who think as I do, that nesting
birds are much best left well alone. Although the Cubans were still
eating abnormally large quantities of food, there was a distinct
charnel house smell in the vicinity of their aviary and I had horrible
visions of one of the young ones dead in the nest and the survival of
the others possibly hinging upon the removal of its decaying corpse !
Incidentally, the origin of this stench was never discovered, but
I think it must have been something that had died in a rather dense
thicket close to the aviary. Nevertheless, at the time I felt sure it
must emanate from the Cubans' nest-box, so I decided to shut the
parents in the shelter and look in. A hurried glance in the rather
dimly-lit depths of the grandfather clock box disclosed two very
healthy-looking about half-grown young ones and I thought I caught
a glimpse of a third, but this proved later to be incorrect.
The two youngsters continued to flourish and when they were
within a week of fledging could be heard climbing about on the wire
ladder inside the box, and they periodically came up to the entrance
hole and looked out.
The first one to emerge came out on the last Sunday in August
and proved to be a most perfect specimen with not a feather out of
place and hardly distinguishable from its parents, except for the almost
complete lack of vinous colouring on the lower breast and abdomen
and the fact that, in the green areas of the plumage, the feathers
were much less heavily bordered with black than in the adults.
Then the most extraordinary and I should have said quite unheard-
of thing occurred : I thought I knew most of the strange and
unpredictable things that birds will do, but the parent Cubans
proceeded to spring a completely new one on me.
They seemed to be terribly excited at the emergence of their first-
born and kept on flying about the aviary, then settling one each side
of it and frantically preening its feathers, so I decided they needed
complete quiet and left them. That was in the morning and I did
not go near them until late afternoon of the same day, only to find
that they had denuded the young one of every single head feather,
giving it a vulturine appearance, but had mercifully left all the rest
of its plumage intact and untouched.
The second one came out the following day, just as perfect a
specimen as the first, and although the parents treated its appearance
rather more calmly they were unable to resist the temptation to pluck
its head--though only slightly this time--and the degrees of plucking

The two young Cuban Amazons, photographed a few days after fledging, are seen
between their parents. Both left the nest in perfect feather, but within a few hours had
had their heads plucked by their parents--the first to fledge (right-centre) coming off
worst, while the second (left-centre) had only a few feathers removed. Now (about five
weeks after being taken away from their parents) they have re-grown all their head
feathers and are again as perfect as when they first left the nest.

are clearly shown in the photograph which was taken about a week
after the young ones left the nest.
It is, alas, all too common among parrot-like birds to pluck their
young ones while still in the nest, and leave off once they are out
of it, but the Cubans' reversal of this process was totally unexpected
and particularly infuriating--seeing how perfect the young ones were
just a matter of a few hours before.
However, as I have said, the plucking fortunately did not include
any of the body feathers, and now that the young ones have been
away from their parents for just on five weeks they have re-grown all
their head feathers and are once more as perfect as they were when
they first left the nest, with the pink areas remarkably vivid for such
young birds.
They are extremely healthy and lively, and are just starting to

As described above, Edward Boosey has bred the Cuban Amazon
Parrot (Amazona leucocephala ). It is believed that this may be a first
success.

that the rearing in my Los Angeles aviaries of many rare doves
is nothing much to boast about. If I have not been more successful,
it is because I am not free from a terrible disease of most aviculturists:
I keep too many birds and they interfere with one another during the
mating season, which lasts the greater part of the year in a good
climate. To be really successful with doves, each pair of large size
should be kept alone in their own aviary, where also one pair of small
ones can be placed, as well as finches and little quails. I follow this
rule for the rarest species, but I have to associate many pairs in larger
flights. There are some good results, but also losses of eggs and young,
and some pairs do not find enough privacy to breed. The following

(7), Mountain Witch (1), Chiriqui (4)5 Martinique (4)5 as well as
some Brush Bronze-wing, Green-winged, Blue Ground, Cape, and
silver Diamond Doves, and lots of Peruvians and Pigmies.
Twenty Gouldians and five Parson Finches were also reared, but
most other finches were little successful, due to overcrowding. Among
my new birds in Los Angeles are Fairy Bluebirds, Hooded Pittas, and
an Emerald Starling.
The breeding season at Cleres was handicapped by Mi. Fooks
illness during the spring. However, Pheasants of the following species
were raised : Mikado, Elliot, Cheer, Horsfield, Swinhoe, Siamese
Fireback, Red and Sonnerat's Junglefowl, Green and Black-winged
Peafowl. Blue, Crowned and Stanley Cranes hatched, but were nol
reared. Many waterfowl bred, the most interesting young being 5
Andean Geese, 10 Philippine and 5 Hawaiian Mhllards. The lattei
come from a pair which I had kept three years in Los Angeles withoul
good results. There were young of several species of doves, particularly
Brush Bronze-wings, and various parrakeets.
I spent the months of March, April, and June in South America
first with an expedition of my Los Angeles County Museum to Brazil
later on visiting Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, ir
the company of Mr. and Mrs. Dillon Ripley, in the interests of th&lt;
International Committee for Bird Preservation. In the course o
this very interesting journey I had an opportunity to visit som&lt;
collections of live birds. I he new Zoo in Rio de Janeiro has \er
good aviaries of parrots and other large birds, both Biazilian an(
exotic, and a number of small birds kept very successfully, in ones o
tw^os in separate cages. I he large Buenos Aires Zoo, which had gon&apos;
down during the Peron regime, is now being renovated. T. he smal
Zoo at Santiago contains many interesting Chilean species.
I saw some good private collections in the vicinity of Rio de Janeirc
where Dr. E. Beraut keeps in a planted verandah a beautiful collectioi
of Humming Birds, which he and his collectors obtain throughou
Brazil. But the visit that I made with him to his friend Mr. F. Rusch

by one original pair. There are about twenty local species in this
aviary, and one can also see several hundreds of wild Hummers in the
garden. Dozens of them are always buzzing as they drink sugar-water
from bottles hung around the verandah of the house, a delightful
sight. Furthermore, a beautiful large (ioo ft. long) house has been
built, with a passage for visitors along its front, to accommodate the
equatorial species from Amazonia which will not stand the cool
nights of Santa Teresa (altitude 3,000 feet).
Both Mr. Ruschi and Dr. Beraut now entirely feed their Hummers
on sugar- or honey-water and on quantities of fruit flies. Even the
difficult, mostly insectivorous, species of Phaetorui and Pyg?nomis do
perfectly well on such a diet.

By David Seth-Smith (Guildford, Surrey, England)
Mr. Walther Langberg has given us an interesting account of the
breeding of the Painted Quail in Copenhagen but, as he does not give
the scientific name of the bird, he might be referring to Turnix varia,
one of the Hemipodes, which in Australia is known as the " Painted
Quail ". However, from his description, Mr. Langberg's bird is
obviously Excalfactoria chinensis, a bird which I was one of the first to
breed in England some fifty years ago. Since those early days this
very attractive species seems to have been rarely imported until quite
recently, and now that it is with us again no doubt aviculturists will
be wanting to breed it, and my experience may be of some help.
Mr. Langberg writes : " Many hens are inclined to lay their eggs
all over the place, or to scatter them around after laying, before they
eventually decide to lay in the nest ; some hens, indeed, never seem
to settle down to serious nesting operations and continue to lay their
eggs broadcast." This is, I believe, the experience of many who have
kept these birds in the ordinary type of aviary with a sanded floor,
and perhaps very little grass in the flight.
My aviaries were constructed with fairly large outside flights, some
12 or 15 feet each way, the height being immaterial so far as quails
are concerned, and the grass was allowed to grow long. As soon as
the quails were allowed into the paddock in the spring they commenced
to form tunnels through the grass, and at the end of one such tunnel
the hen would make her nest, perfectly hidden from all prying eyes.
One could only guess where the nest was situated by watching the
hen appear and disappear into a tunnel and notice the movement of
the grass as she proceeded along it. It is advisable not to be too
inquisitive and not on any account to disturb the grass to examine

the nest, but patiently to wait until, on about the seventeenth or
eighteenth day after you first noticed her disappearance, she is seen
to appear with her brood of the smallest and loveliest chicks you can
imagine. You will have noticed her appearance from time to time
at the feeding place during incubation to satisfy you that all is
going well.
I made a small portable run, about 5 feet by 3 feet, of 9 in. boards
at the sides and wire netting top, into which I gently drove the hen
and her brood so that they could have special care and attention for
the first week or so of their lives. A piece of waterproof material was
placed over part of this for shelter and part of the top made to open
for feeding. When quite young there is no food so good as ants' eggs,
fresh and newly dug up. I used to take a large tin and a trowel and
collect a supply that would last for days and I gave a good supply
each day though, as Mr. Langberg says, the chicks very soon begin
to take small seeds as well as insectivorous soft food.
In any type of aviary, even in a cage, these little quails will lay
plenty of eggs--in fact far too many--but, in my experience, without
the chance of hiding her nest in the grass the hen is unlikely to sit ;
but given the conditions I have described, success is pretty certain,
barring such accidents as floods ! And my experience of these birds
was not confined to just one pair ; I have had several and all behaved
in the same way, including examples of the Australian race, E. lineata ,
a slightly smaller and darker race than the type. In Australia this is
known as the " King Quail ". Although newly imported, these bred
just as freely as the others when given the right conditions, and the
chicks were at first almost black. Two broods of four or five were
reared each season.
One difficulty with the non-perching quails when kept in outdoor
aviaries is that, although they are generally perfectly tame, they are
liable at times suddenly to panic, especially at night, and to fly up
like rockets from the ground, hitting the top of the aviary and being
either scalped or killed outright. Owls or cats are probably to blame,
but whatever the cause efforts must be made to prevent it either by
cutting the flight-feathers of one wing or, perhaps better still, pinioning.
In the wild state these birds rarely fly, only doing so to escape from
predators or to travel from one district to another, so it is no hardship
whatever if they are prevented from flying altogether, and it in no
way detracts from their appearance.

We are fortunate at the New Grounds in having representatives of
all species of this most interesting group of the Anatidae which link
the characteristics of swans, geese, and ducks. As in the former two,
they have reticulated epithelium on the tarsi, are long-necked, and
the plumage of both sexes is similar. Arborea in particular has been
noted to graze but they mostly feed as do ducks, and bicolor and
arcuata dive a great deal. There are at the time of writing examples
of the following eight forms :--

Of these, five species have bred at Slimbridge. Five specie s aic k( pt
full-winged and seem to enjoy liberty a great deal ; they fly often
and quite high. Unfortunately, although the main flock have stayed
with us, odd pairs have strayed away. They have a predilection for
perching on chimneys, roofs, and gateposts and we have erected
perching posts especially for them.
From their behaviour in captivity one would have thought that, in
their natural habitat, arborea and arcuata were inveterate tree nesters.
Our birds invariably use the barrels and boxes provided for Carolinas.
But apparently this is not the case (Delacour, The Waterfowl of the
World , Vol. I). We have found that autumnalis likes to nest in much
denser cover than other members of the group, preferably under thick
bramble and brushwood. Nevertheless, although so difficult for us to
locate, the eggs suffer greatly from the attention of vermin, aided no
doubt by the fact that the female leaves the eggs uncovered during
the whole period of laying. I he clutches aie relatively laige (from
nine to sixteen) and fecundity is a strong point : a pair of autumnalis
laid seventy-two eggs in one season. Ihe eggs are invariably white
and the shells are of roughish texture--so that we have found it
difficult to distinguish those of the bantams used as substitutes. Bot 1
sexes incubate and the nest is never left unattended once incubation
has begun. Perhaps for this reason there is no lining of the nest wit 1
down.

It is noteworthy that four of the five species seem to have slightly
shorter incubation periods than those given by Delacour (shown here
in parenthesis).
Fertility and hatchability of the specimens at the New Grounds
are high compared with other groups. An interesting point has been
observed at hatching time ; a relatively high percentage of eggs have
the shell pipped near the " equator ", an observation that has not
been noted in other genera.
The day-old young of any species of whistling duck are particularly
attractive. The characteristic feature of their downy pattern is the
light band circumventing the occiput and dividing off the lower edge
of the dark cap to form the cross stroke of a " T " of which the
down stroke carries down the back of the neck.
By far the most striking is that of autumnalis which is clad in a
wasp-like contrast of vivid yellow and black. Viduata and arborea
have similar patterns, but of considerably less brilliance. Bicolor and
arcuata are purplish-grey shading to an almost black cap, the latter
being distinguishable by a light supraorbital stripe.
It has been our experience that all birds of the genus are extremely
apprehensive if touched and from day-old duckling to adult when
handled they give vent to a high-pitched scream. Nevertheless, they
are, when fully grown, very tame and have an insatiable curiosity in
all things human.
The ducklings are particularly unhappy in cold, wet weather and
appear to thrive only if the temperature is moderate. They have an
idiosyncrasy that causes them a deal of discomfort in that (even when
they are supplied with a minimum of drinking water) they will carry
their mash to the water, immerse their bills, and, sucking water up
at the nail, eject it through the sides together with some of the mash.
Thus they contrive to cover themselves with a sticky mess and we
have lost a number of ducklings as a result of this condition. If given
enough water in which to bath and swim they do attempt to wash
off the paste, but we have found that it is necessary to supply artificial
heat in the form of infra-red lamps. The aforementioned state has
occurred in three of the five species reared at the New Grounds,
although it is not the inevitable sequence of events and many broods
have been reared without any duckling achieving this appearance of
emaciated dejection.

The fragility of the young does not make for successful rearing if
-ft at large with the parent birds. Similarly, if caught up and separated
*om them the babies do not thrive. But if one can manage to catch
&apos;ae adults up as well and put them in an aviary there is an excellent
hance of their survival, a fact we have demonstrated on several
iccasions.
The Southern Red-billed Whistling Ducks are by far the most
ascinating of the group ; they have an abiding interest in all our
activities--if able they will always attend the uncrating of newly
arrived birds. Another form of entertainment indulged in, a rather
roublesome one, is the enjoyment they derive from trundling the eggs

Readers may remember my account of the breeding of the
Citron-crested Cockatoos, whose picture appears in this number.
In the September--October issue of 1955 ^ described the events up
to the time when the young fledged. Although I disposed of the young
I still have the adult pair and they had at least partial breeding success
again in 1956. Since September, 1955, there were, however, a series
of mishaps from which some avicultural morals can be drawn and an
account of which may be of interest to those of our members who are
trying to breed the larger parrot-like species.
The first mishap concerned the adult male ol the breeding pair.
On the 23rd of September, 1955, ^ began to think (perhaps wiongly)
that the young male was getting into trouble with his paients, which
I accordingly removed to the adjacent (smaller) flight. As, howevei, it
appeared that the young were eating very little dining that day, I
reunited the family by putting all together in the smaller flight. Here
they remained until 5th October. On that evening I came home at
dusk to find the whole party sitting outside in the unprotected flight in
torrential rain. I entered the flight to try to move them into the shelter ;
a lot of very large birds panicked in a rather small and over-perched
flight and next morning the old male had a hipped wing. He seemed
to have damaged the terminal joint when flying hard between the
perches and has never fully recovered, although he can fly short distances
and is able to mate without any difficulty, lhe moral heie (which, of
course, I knew as well as anyone) is not to enter aviaiies at dusk unless
the birds are very accustomed to the position of the perches.
The second mishap occurred after I had finally separated adults and
young. Owing to the fact that the young hen seemed extremely slow

in becoming self-supporting, I left the parents in the adjoining aviary,
separated in one place by a single layer of 2 in. chain-link netting.
Feeding through the wires gradually ceased and the young were due
to be sent to their new owner on 24th November. I left them, on that
morning, in perfect condition and appearance and arranged to come
home at lunch-time to put them in the travelling-boxes. I arrived to
find the aviary (so it appeared to my appalled eye) a welter of blood
with the baby hen savagely bitten on the foot. Fortunately a good and
rapid recovery took place and, by the report of the killing of a young
Citron-crest by the parents at Whipsnade, it seems that I was lucky to
have such limited damage. The moral is, of course, that if an
apparently happy family group is broken up, great care must be taken
to ensure that the breeding pair and the young are properly separated.
The old birds will treat the young as they would any other potential
enemy of the same species. E. N. T. Vane, who saw the arrangements
shortly before the accident occurred, will remember warning the owner
as to what might happen.
The third mishap is sufficiently near still to influence the course
of events this season. During the early spring of 1956 the
cockies were making desperate attempts to start nesting and their
hole-digging in the aviary floor assumed major proportions. On
7th April they were switched into the breeding aviary. On 7th May
both were in the barrel at night and I imagine that an egg was laid
at that time. On the morning of 10th May, the female was in distress
in the shelter, unable to fly and showing all the signs of egg-binding.
(How providential it is that egg-bound hens come out of the nesting-
boxes.) She was at once brought into the house and a heroic tem-
perature raised in the smallest bedroom with the aid of all available
domestic heating appliances. Shortly before six at night she laid an
egg on the floor of the parrot cage where she was confined. The egg
appeared thin-shelled, although otherwise perfect, and was put aside
for measuring while the owner celebrated in the usual way.
Unfortunately, by the next morning it had dehydrated and collapsed,
so that accurate measurement was impossible. The hen Citron-crest
made a very rapid recovery and was returned to her aviary on the
evening of the following day. I had qualms about doing this, but was
influenced by the fact that the cock had remained guarding the first-
laid egg for the thirty-six hours during which the hen had been absent
Jrom the flight and by the belief that there were no more eggs to be laid.
I he pair has incubated steadily ever since and at the time of writing
(10th June, 1956) should have hatched. I am hopeful of the outcome
but not optimistic. I am not sure that there is any moral in this story.
As far as I am aware nobody knows why birds become egg-bound ;
the condition certainly seems to involve the temporary paralysis of
more than the oviduct itself and there is some sort of connection with

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
We are glad to report that our Bewick's Swans have nested, hatched,
md reared young at the New Grounds. It is understood that the species
;&gt;red at Woburn before 1914, but we know of no other record and
unfortunately we have no details of the first record.
The male of the pair at the Wildfowl Trust appeared on our marsh
in November, 1948. It was a bird of the year, and, having lived with
the wild geese for some days, ventured into our rushy pen. Eventually
he was induced to come and feed with our tame birds and by degrees
enticed into a trap. For eighteen months he lived with our Whistling
Swans and then we managed to obtain a wild-caught female from
Holland. Owing to shortage of space and the belief that these birds
were unlikely breeders, they were placed in a rather unattractive pen
measuring some 15 yards by 20 yards in size with a very small area
of water by accepted standards.
The pair showed no signs of breeding or even mating before 1956
but on 2nd June it was noticed that there were the rudiments of
a nest constructed of the rush growing in the pen. The following
day both birds were observed building, though they still remained as
shy and retiring as ever. The female was seen sitting and shaping the
nest on successive days and then to our delight on 6th June we found
the first egg. Three eggs formed the clutch and the average weight
was 265 gm. and dimensions were 118 mm. by 82 mm. I he male
was never observed to take part in incubation and indeed, compared
with other swans, did not offer very great defence of his consort when
the nest was approached.
The first cygnet hatched on the twenty-ninth day and the second
in thirty days. The third egg was infertile.
The cygnets are enchanting little things of white down with a steel-
blue overall appearance, their bills and feet a delicate pink. Much
to their parents' apprehension they became quite tame and would
approach quite close when their food was brought. Their diet consists
of Spratts' Maxco reinforced with an extra 8 per cent protein and

every kind of pond and water weed obtainable--duckweed, water-
cress, water celery, horned, curly ^and Canadian pondweeds, horn-
wort, and grass. In spite of all&quot;efforts one soon fell behind and
eventually died when six weeks old. The remaining cygnet continued
to thrive and showed signs of feathering when eight weeks old. By
sixteen weeks the bird was fully feathered, the plumage being a dirty
white, considerably lighter than that reported for Whistling and
Trumpeters. The bill remained pink with the exception of the tip.
The legs have lost their flesh colour and are now blotched with grey.

SOUTH-EAST ASIA NOTES

My wife and I spent five months primarily in Indonesia in the
</equation>

summer and autumn of 1954* It was a trip made more vivid for me
by the fact that I had spent fourteen months collecting birds in New
Guinea and Sumatra in 1938 and 1939. An account of some of my
experiences looking for live birds during those trips appeared in
the Avicultural Magazine in 193d and 1940. Naturally to a
returning visitor the main mental preoccupation is with the changes
which exist on every hand, these and the aura of speed which hangs
over the world to-day, rendering every impression more fleeting,
making it so much harder to savour things, to drink in the
surroundings.
When I reached New Guinea in the autumn of 1937, we had been
ten months out from New York on a small schooner. We were more
or less attuned to the pace of our surroundings. Now one can fly
KLM to Djakarta or Biak in under three days from New York.
It takes days in Java, weeks in New Guinea to get over a transition
like that.
Our first stop in South-East Asia was Bangkok, where we spent
three days, primarily to rest up after the long flight from Europe.
I was very much pleased, however, to meet a distinguished Thai
doctor and naturalist, Dr. Boonsong Lekagul, who among his manifold
other interests, is developing the first contemporary Siamese Zoo.
We unfortunately did not get to the Zoo while we were in Bangkok,
but I understand it has made a good start with Gaur, deer of several
species, tiger, and other mammals. Apparently birds are not much
in evidence as yet. But there is promise for the future in Dr. Boonsong's
energy. The bird market in Bangkok is most disappointing, a few
miserable huts along a canal near Wireless Road. Mostly the dealers
sell poultry and domestic pigeons, but there were a few 7 doves, some
jungle fowl, and munias and weaver birds. Fortunately for them

vdld birds are often bought in Buddhist countries to be released lor
nerit, a welcome deliverance to such poorly kept creatures. A tame
adjutant Stork kept at liberty by one of the shopkeepers provided the
ingle exotic note in the assemblage.
Our next stop was Djakarta, now a vast city suffering the intense
)angs of post-war overcrowding. Large suburban cities, such as the
lew Kemajoram, are being hastily put up in the outskirts in an effort
o keep pace with the growing pains. The pre-war Zoo still exists in
1 small park in a residential part of the city. The park is brightly
lluminated and has cinema, games of chance, tea shops, etc., so that
he atmosphere is rather carnival-like. We avoided it on a friend's
idvice, but did visit the bird market, which is in the general produce
market area. Perhaps because it was raining, our general impression
was a poor one. Sloshing about over heaps of manure and rotting
vegetation, staring up into the dank recesses of tiny huts at nests of
dirty cages packed to bursting with huddled, frightened, soiled little
birds, was an unhappy experience.
The variety was considerable, as bulbuls of several species, babblers,
barbets, starlings, mynahs, munias, and weaverbirds were there.
We saw several Green Javan Jungle Fowl also, but they were all
cocks, evidently trapped by the use of a caged captive female. One
of our friends who lived in Djakarta had been buying a number of
bulbuls, dyal thrushes, and other common cage birds, but the mortality
rate was high, I am afraid due to the conditions of trapping and
keeping the birds in the market.
We spent one or two days driving about in Java, and managed to
see a few local birds. It always seems strange to see Java Spano\\s
flying about at liberty, as they do in the palace enclosure in Djogja-
karta. They look as if they must have just that moment escaped from
a cage. We saw hawks of several species. Brahminy Kites, Haliastur,
and &amp; the Serpent Eagle, Spilornis , were very common all along the
coasts, and in the hills I saw a small falcon. Minivets weie common
in the lower hills, as were bulbuls, coucals, or crow pheasants, the
Golden Oriole, shrikes, tits, the White-bellied Swiftlet, and the
Pink-headed Flowerpecker. Nearer the towns mynahs and crows
and an occasional drongo were almost the only bird life visible.
The human population is so great on Java and so constantly inci easing
that it seems hard to imagine that birds of any soit can withstand
the hordes of children armed with catapults much longei !
The Zoo in Surabaja was a delight, still as good as ever. It must
be by far the best Zoo in South-East Asia, if not in all Asia. It
certainly is better than the Calcutta Zoo, and ceitainly bettei than
anything in Japan, although I am not up to date on what the last
few years have produced in that country.
The Surabaja Zoo has the best kept small birds that I have seen

anywhere in the tropics in a public garden. Such difficult species a
woodpeckers, the Golden-backed, pittas, barbets (three species)
forktails, laughing thrushes, babblers, among these Turdinus an&lt;
Kenopia , rainforest species, and hanging lorikeets, all were apparentl
thriving in roomy, beautifully planted aviaries, with adequat
sheltered quarters in the rear, and fresh, clean pans of food an&lt;
water, always a problem in a hot climate. The present success of thi
Zoo is a heritage from two clever Europeans, brothers, who hac
worked for the Gardens for years, and now I understand hav.
emigrated to New Zealand. They had trained the keepers well, am
there was no visible slackening up of effort. Six magnificent Komod&lt;
Giant Monitor Lizards or " Dragons " (two are now at the Bronx
Zoo in New York), two fine Sumatra tigers, orang-utans, and ;
Sumatran elephant were notable parts of the menagerie.
Going east we voyaged into the Moluccas or Spice Islands, vi&lt;
the port of Makassar, Celebes. This grotesque swastika-shapec
island has now been officially re-named Sulawesi. In Makassar I wa;
disturbed to hear that in 1953 some 200 or more skins of the Greater
Bird of Paradise, Paradisea apoda , from the Aru Islands, which ar&lt;
also a part of the Republic of Indonesia, had been shipped out o
Makassar by a local Chinese trader. These skins are said to be bough
locally from crewmen from the coastal steamers coming from th(
Aru Islands for about 40 Rupiahs each. This sum is equivalent tc
anything from $1.50 to $3.30, depending on official or open marker
rates of exchange. It was also reported that the skins could be sold
for approximately $10.40 each in Paris or West Germany.
The only pet birds here and farther east seem to be Cockatoos,
mostly Umbrella-fronted (C. alba), and an occasional Moluccar
(G. moluccensis ), which latter species if obtainable are very expensive,
and Eclectus Parrots, with occasional lories, crimson, or green-
winged. All these parrot-like birds are caught as young at the nesl
and reared on gummy, boiled rice, coconut, and coconut milk, and
maize. They obviously survive, but there must be a considerable
mortality among the young. As these species are Moluccan in origin,
they are brought to Makassar and Java on the coastal steamers by
sailors.
In the Moluccas themselves we spent three months on Ternate,
Halmahera, Tidore, Batjan, and farther east on Misool. All these
islands are as beautiful and unspoiled as ever, their forests largely
uncut, except around towns like Ternate, life being much as it has
been for centuries. It is still possible to walk out of the town of
Labuha on Batjan, for example, where Alfred Russell Wallace stopped
to see the Sultan in the i85o's, and to reach jungle, real jungle on
foot, after a couple of hours. And it is still possible in this jungle
to see Wallace's Standard-wing Bird of Paradise, that curious and

il-proportioned looking bird, which Wallace had first seen on the
iay when he stood outside the Sultan's palace, and Ali his faithful
ssistant ran up with one attached to his belt.
But alas, there is not a living soul on Batjan to-day who seems to
now or care about birds of any sort. During our five weeks on that
dand we asked diligently after local hunters or woodsmen, only to
&gt;e told that all the principal ones were too old or had died off. No
me has ever heard of trapping birds except parrots or cockatoos
n their nest holes. No one could do a thing to help us. Perhaps it is
ust as well that the inhabitants are as indifferent as they are. Certainly
lothing is likely to change in a hurry in the Moluccas. The basic
Iriving forces of man, hunger, love, fear, seem somehow in abeyance
lere, at least the first and the last. Love, of course, triumphs, but for
ome mysterious reason the population rate is not as staggering as
arther west on Java.
At least, though, there are the islands. When typical Western
mpatience is about to get the best of one, when some delay or exhibi-
ion of human frailty or inertia is nearly overwhelming, it is usually
mly necessary to lift one's eyes up towards the sky, to look out over
:he majestic sweep of sea and sky and pointed volcanic-cone islands,
;o be glad to be there. The vivid greens of the islands, the multi-
farious blues of the sky and the sea, and the incredible panoplied
douds are all there, unchanging, always beautiful. Those sights
and the birds we saw, shy, glimpsed often with difficulty, made our
trip worthwhile. Much of the rest of travel in these exotic lands has
become so burdensome and wearying that I doubt that many would
wish to share such a voyage to-day. In many ways it seems better by
far to settle down in an armchair with Wallace or Forbes or Guillemard
or the others, and read of it all " far away and long ago

there was one well-feathered baby with a delightful little crest.
Unfortunately, it died about a week later. Further bad luck has been
with the Plum-heads. Since I last wrote, in mildly optimistic mood,
[ have lost the last year's young bird (hatched May, 1955). It was
as fat as could be and a very careful P.M. in my lab. showed absolutely
nothing. I need hardly say that it was a female : the ovaries were
becoming active. It had developed a grey-green head in the first
autumn (1955) moult and a dark-grey head in the autumn (1956)
moult. I had always believed it to be a hen by the look of its head.
As if this wasn't enough--this year's young bird (a lovely one when
it emerged) has gone wrong and is now in the house on a diet of
vitamins. I am going to bring a pair into a warm room this spring,
and to h- with all the experts. Plum-heads are like Kendall :

Delacour, with illustrations by Peter Scott. Published by
Country Life, London, 1956. Price #6 6^. net.
This is the second volume of the three projected, which will cover
the waterfowl, swans, geese, and ducks of the world. This compre-
hensive work on a group of birds which have a very wide interest both
to general ornithologists and to the more specialized aviculturist, is
the result of a happy combination of two experts of world renown on
their subject--Jean Delacour and Peter Scott.
As stated in the introduction to the volume under review, the
first volume (reviewed in the Jan.-Feb. number 1955 of the Avicul-
tural Magazine) dealt with the more terrestrial members of the
family Anatidae. The second volume is confined to one tribe, the
Dabbling, Surface-feeding, or River Ducks, which include thirty-eight
species of the genus Anas, together with five abberant genera each
consisting of one species, which are tentatively placed with Anas as
their position in the general system of genera and species of Anatinae
are still not clearly understood. These are the Pink-headed Duck
of India (Rhodonessa) , Australian Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus ),
the Blue Duck of New Zealand [Hymenolaimus) , the South American
Torrent Ducks ( Merganetta ), and the Freckled Duck ( Stictonetta ) of
parts of Australia and Tasmania.
The number of colour plates has been increased from sixteen to
twenty-four in order that every member of the tribe and its duckling
may be shown in colour. There are twenty-nine distribution maps
and a full systematic list, and indices of scientific and English names.
This is a worthy successor of the first volume and everyone interested
in waterfowl will wish to possess it. P. B-S.

to the technique and Art of Wild Animal Portraiture. By Hugh B
Cott. Illustrated. Published by the Fountain Press, London
1956. Price #2 12J 1 . 6 d.
This is the first book to be devoted to a subject which has become
of great importance as an aid to scientific research, and also nov
attracts an increasing number of animal photographers. Birds have
always remained favourite subjects and aviculturists who wish to make
photographic records of the inmates of their aviaries will find the
information crowded into these pages invaluable. The first chaptei
is devoted to the choice and characteristics of cameras and for serious
bird photography the decided preference is for the larger, heavier, and
more old-fashioned type. The author then deals with various technical
aspects--apparatus and accessories, focussing, exposure, negatives,
development, and other details ; and the reader is given detailed
information, often in tabular form, of the advantages and disadvantages
of various equipments and methods. The artistic approach to zoological
photography raises a topic on which the author is an authority as he is
a rare combination of zoologist, naturalist, artist, and skilled
photographer. An elementary knowledge of the principles of picture
design and especially the importance of tone will help the photographer
to obtain a pleasing and effective picture which impresses the subject
on the mind much more effectively than a poor one. But for the full
use of a good photograph, a negative of good quality, critical sharpness,
and sufficient size is absolutely essential.
The chapter devoted to the scientific approach to zoological photo-
graphy stresses the value of the camera in recording zoological
information, though this by no means excludes the artistic approach.
The innate responses and social behaviour of birds, for example, can
be recorded much better by the camera than by lengthy descriptions.
The use of infra-red photographs opens an entirely new and little
explored world to the naturalist, especially in the field of camouflage,
and has made possible the photography of animals in complete
darkness.
The author has travelled extensively and draws from personal
experience in giving advice on the photography of animals under
widely different conditions such as tropical rain forests, desert, and
savannah. The latter part of the book consists of a series of plates
reproducing 68 of the author's photographs of zoological subjects,
illustrating various topics discussed in the text ; but although very
good examples of the photographer's skill they hardly do justice to the
originals. The book can be thoroughly recommended to all those
interested in a fascinating hobby of great scientific value.

Illustrated. Published by Cage Birds , London, 1956. Price gs. 6 d.
This book is based on a series of articles that appeared in Cage Birds.
The author, a well-known veterinarian and biochemist who was
formerly Milford Research Professor in the University of Wales,
describes in simple language, accompanied by a series of clear diagrams,
the essential features of the anatomy and development of birds. This
information is essential for a clear understanding of the real workings
of the bird's body in health and disease. The first chapter deals with
the general framework of the body--the skeleton and joints--and is
followed by an account of the surface anatomy. Successive chapters are
concerned with the leg, wing, digestive system, excretory system,
reproductive system, respiratory system, blood system, ductless glands,
nervous system including ear and eye, and the organs of voice pro-
duction. Finally there is a chapter on the development of the chick
before hatching.
Aviculturists will find the general principles described in this book
of great % help in a further understanding of the many problems
associated with the health, behaviour, general activities, and feeding
of birds in captivity. It is a useful addition to avicultural literature.

PARROTS, COCKATOOS and MACAWS. By Edward J. Boosey.
Published by the Rockcliff Press Publishing Corporation.
London, 1956. Price 21J. net.
The appearance of a book dealing with parrots, cockatoos, and
macaws by such a well-known aviculturist will be welcomed by all
those interested in these most popular birds. While still a schoolboy
Mr. Boosey bred budgerigars and Red-Rump Parrakeets and he has
five times been awarded the Avicultural Society's medal for a first
breeding in captivity of various species including the African Grey,
the Blue-fronted Amazon, and the Varied Lorikeet. He speaks with
authority, therefore, in the chapters dealing with the feeding, care
and breeding, and common parrot illnesses and how to deal with them.
There is also an interesting chapter on parrot-keeping in the past,
including mention of a Grey Parrot belonging to Henry VIII, and
another which was the favourite of the Duchess of Lennox and
Richmond, a mistress of King Charles II. The stuffed body of this
parrot is supposed to be the oldest stuffed bird in the world and is
preserved in Westminster Abbey.
There are brief descriptions of each species and useful notes on the
characteristics of the more common ones, many of which have been
kept by the author. It is rather unfortunate, however, that more care

Rare Bird Records and " Escapes "
The number of birds which have been added to the British List has greatly increas
during recent years, no doubt in no small part due to the widespread interest in bi
watching and the large number of bird-watchers there are all over the count
In the case of some species, however, there is always a doubt as to whether these ;
genuine wild birds or escapes from zoos or private owners. With waterfowl this
particularly the case and for this reason the Avicultural Society instituted its ringi
scheme for waterfowl, the rings issued being a light blue in order that they should
as visible as possible in the field ; an additional advantage in the use of these rii
is the possibility of restoring the " lost " birds to their owners.
The Editors of British Birds in which records of rare birds are published are alw;
anxious to establish without doubt that the records are of truly wild specimens a
to this end the aid of aviculturists is earnestly sought. If anyone has lost a bird wh
might be taken for a visitor to this country it would be of great assistance if he woi
report this to the Hon. Secretary of the Society or to the Editor of the Avicultur
Magazine.
The most recent " record " confronting the Editors of British Birds at present, i
Flamingo seen at Bartley Reservoir, near Birmingham, on 2nd December, 19
Inquiries from likely zoos have elicited that no bird has been lost from these collectio
It seems more than likely that this bird is an escape. Can readers of the Avicultui
Magazine help to solve this problem ?

R.OSEATE x BARE-EYED COCKATOO HYBRID
By Karol Lukaszewigz (Director of the Zoo, Wroclaw, Poland)
The female Bare-eyed Cockatoo possessed by the Wroclaw Zoo
as quite an old bird when, in 1948, it returned from a temporary
)st-war exile to our bird house. Its very clamorous call, uttered
pecially frequently in the evening hours, and heard far away in the
irk, made me suspect that it was a female. For a time it shared
ie same aviary and company of a Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo,
en lived with many other parrots, but was much dreaded by them
'cause of its pugnacious character. Finally, it associated itself with
red Macaw until, in 1953, the Zoo came into possession of a Roseate
ockatoo, whose most outstanding quality consisted in a remarkable
repertoire " of some fifty Polish words.
The two cockatoos became excellent friends from the very moment
ey saw each other and as the Bare-eyed at the same time stopped
ving its evening concerts of cries, I thought it proper to give this
mewhat unusual couple an opportunity to nest. A trunk of an old
rn tree, 5 feet high with a diameter of some 12 inches, was placed
one corner of the aviary. A circular hole measuring 4 inches was
ade in the front of the bark-covered trunk and below this an oblong
;sure invited the birds to work it with their beaks so as to enlarge
ie shallow cavity inside the trunk. Both cockatoos took great interest
. working at the trunk. Day after day the Roseate male left the
hole of the ground near the trunk covered with chips and splinters,
worked so hard. Gradually the hole inside the trunk became
rger and larger and the birds managed to transform the narrow
isure into a wide entrance to their nest situated a little below the
iginal circular opening.
By the beginning of 1955 it was evident that the friendship of the
/o cockatoos was of the most serious nature. The best proof of it
as an egg laid on the last day of March. The Roseate male and
e Bare-eyed female were sitting and incubating most assiduously on

their nest and in the intervals did not stop working at the trunk,
After twenty-one days of incubation the keeper found, on the morning
of 18th May, that a young bird had hatched and was lying dead or
the sand on the ground of the aviary. A conspicuous feature of the
young was a well-developed bare area around the eyes.
Six months later, in December, 1955, the cockatoos mated again
several times during a week. Eggs, two in number, pure white and
the size of a larger pigeon egg, were laid on 6th and 8th January.
Incubation began once, the male relieving the female every three
hours by day and night, and lasted for thirty-two days. The young
ones hatched on 8th February and lived for twelve days. Their rate
of growth showed itself to be very good. At the time of death they
were covered with conspicuous quills. The explanation of this mishap
is not easy. Obviously the parents fed the young birds well and we
found no reason to interfere by taking them out of the nest. The
birds were absolutely unmolested and the keeper did not even dare
to enter the cage because of the agressiveness of both adult birds.
The post-mortem examination of the two young ones, which were
normally developed and weighed respectively 88.5 gr. and 118.0 gr,
did not reveal any pathological changes. The stomach and the
intestines, however, were copiously filled with sand, which wa&lt;
probably brought with the food. The floor of the aviary was therefore
scrupulously cleared of sand and only a small box containing some
gravel was left in the aviary for the parents.
Almost immediately after the death of the young ones the parent:
mated again and eggs were laid on 10th, 12th, and 17th March. The
laying of the last egg was somewhat belated and for three days the
female (the Bare-eyed) was evidently feeling sick ; it could not keep
perched normally across the branches but laid along them with it
eyes shut and shivering, often with cowered wings--a typical picture
of what in German is called the Legenot. Two eggs disappeared ir
an unaccountable way leaving no trace. Finally, on 5th April, 1956
a young one hatched and was reared successfully up to the age 0:
twenty-one days, when suddenly the parents stopped feeding it. Thi:
was noticed too late and the young one died from under-nourishment
On 21 st and 25th May, 1956, again three eggs were laid. Thf
incubation was regular and lasted from twenty-five to thirty days
The first young cockatoo hatched on 15th May and from the beginning
was obviously a stronger bird. The two others did not thrive anc
died a few days after hatching, on 18th and 20th May. The surviv&apos;d
was left with the parents for ten days, during which it was regularl)
fed by them. On 26th May, however, as the parents were observec
to be neglecting their duties, the old cockatoos were moved to ar
aviary some distance away and the young hybrid confided to th&lt;
care of a keeper, Mrs. Teresa Ungert.

The bird was fed by the keeper from her mouth every two hours
etween 7 * 3 * a * m * and 6.30 p.m. For the first three days it was given
pap of hard-boiled yolk and toast in this way ; then chopped and
rushed sunflower seed and fresh strawberry juice were added.
Gradually this diet was amplified by cake, pulped mashed apple,
oiled rice with strawberry juice, pumpkin seed, lemon and red
urrant juice, fresh cherries, and tomatoes.
The young cockatoo grew fast and fledged normally, the quills
ppearing first on the wings and the crest after the eighth day. After
month the feathers developed to such an extent as to show the
Dlours. The general colouring was that of the father : dove-grey
hove, dirty rosy-yellow on cheeks and underparts, with pure white
rimaries. The bare area round the eye, characteristic of the mother
7 . gymnopis), was well developed but instead of the blue tinge of
. gymnopis it was a pronounced yellow colour. From the age of four
r eeks the young hybrid began to utter peeping sounds, when six weeks
Id it began to preen its plumage. Unfortunately, on 13th August,
fter a short period of sickness the young cockatoo died of pneumonia,
robably contracted during a stay of a few minutes outside the
ouse, when having its photograph taken.
The experiment of artificially rearing a cockatoo hybrid, despite
le final negative result, has thus proved successful. The hybrid lived
fty-nine days and it is probable that, in spite of an undoubtedly
elicate constitution it might have been brought to complete maturity,
he anatomical examination, however, showed that the skeleton of
le young bird was rather weak, and therefore in future attempts
reater attention must be paid to the supply of mineral components.
The interbreeding of C. roseicapilla and C. gymnopis seems to indicate
jiat the two species are more closely related to each other than has
een assumed in the past.

(.Athene noctua)
By C. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
In 1951 I got two specimens of the Little Owl from Germany. The
birds were exactly similar in size so I had no idea as to the sex. In
winter they were kept in a well-lighted indoor aviary about 10x4 feet
and 8 feet high. They spent the summer in a compartment in our cages
for small birds of prey. This compartment is 20 X 5 feet and 8 feet
high with an adjoining open-fronted shelter 5X5 feet. The upper
part is boarded about 3 feet downwards from the roof, giving the birds
an undisturbed and well protected shelter. In the climate of Finland
we are simply forced to take most birds--even our native ones--
inside for the winter, among other reasons, in order to prevent the
soft food and meat from freezing as hard as a stone. The keeping ol
birds and mammals in a climate like our's presents problems unknown
to avicultural and zoological colleagues living in milder latitudes. We
cannot release the birds into the outdoor aviaries too early in the spring,
as experience has shown that, even if kept in only slightly warmed
rooms, the birds are rather delicate if put outside in the early spring,
even though the same specimens may stand quite low temperatures in
late autumn without any ill effects.
In 1952 and 1953 the Little Owls made no attempt to nest, but early
in April, 1954, two white eggs were laid on the floor of the flight. On
2nd April, 1955, an egg was found on the floor of the flight. Without
very high hopes I constructed a nest of brick on the floor of the flight and
covered it with a piece of plywood kept in position with a brick.
Inside I made a nest of some hay and put the newly-laid egg in the
nest. Contrary to my expectations the nest was accepted and four more
eggs laid in it. As far as I could see incubation started about 8th April
On 6th May I observed some egg-shells in front of the nest and or
removing the plywood cover saw some white, downy youngsters under
the female. I was not able to find out whether all the eggs had hatched
as I did not want to disturb the birds unnecessarily. Observation oi
the birds was not easy as one of the parents, obviously the female,
immediately disappeared into the nest when the room was entered.
The old birds were not shy in a hysterical way, but were always on the
watch for every movement ; they had obviously been caught wher
full grown. When I looked into the nest a fortnight later I saw that al
the eggs had hatched and the youngsters were obviously thriving well
As far as I could see they were all the same size and I am under tht
impression that incubation had started as soon as the eggs were laid 01
possibly at least most of them. On 6th June I saw three youngster. 1
popping round on the floor when I entered the room, but they al
immediately disappeared into the nest. I entered the flight anc

emoved the cover of the nest and all five youngsters came out and
vent running round the aviary, trying to fly without success. About a
veek later, however, they were all sitting on their perches, 6-7 feet
tigh, but for several days they rushed down to the nest whenever the
00m was entered. After yet another week they remained on their
&gt;erches or flew from perch to perch and I removed the nest. The
amily was then moved to the outside flight, the young having first
&gt;een ringed with aluminium parrakeet rings. They are all thriving
r ery well. When they left the nest the young were similar in colour to
heir parents and are now quite indistinguishable, so I am glad I ringed
hem in good time.
As to food, the owls have mainly been fed on white mice, rats, and
;olden hamsters, very occasionally also with chickens, crows (the two
ast named being cut into suitable pieces), and Budgerigar runners.
r resh ants' eggs were scattered over the food. We breed a lot of
lamsters as food for our small owls and birds of prey and they obviously
eem to prefer them to other rodents. In my experience Little Owls are
onsiderably easier to keep than many other small species, for instance,
Tengmalm's and Passerine Owls. With exactly the same treatment the
fengmalm's Owls are difficult to maintain for any length of time.
They seem to thrive quite well for some time but suddenly sit on the
ground and are usually dead within a day or two.
I have never seen the Little Owls bathing, even if suitable facilities
at least in my opinion) are always at their disposal. But they seem to
njoy sitting outside in the rain and getting their feathers wet.
As a summary : it seems that the eggs are laid at intervals of one
lay and that incubation starts when the last or second last egg is laid,
ncubation obviously lasts about four weeks. The youngsters leave the
test (in captivity, at least) when about a month old and can fly quite
veil a week later. After the nestling down there does not seem to be
my intermediate colour in their first plumage, but the young
immediately attain the colour of the old birds, a fact I have also
&gt;bserved when breeding Eagle-Owls.
I regret that my observations are not more exact, but as this is the
irst time I have bred this species I would not take any risks as I was
mxious to get a complete success with the birds.
Additional note .--In the winter 1955-56 I unfortunately lost the old
len and one youngster and no attempts to breed were made by the
emaining five birds in the spring of 1956.

By J. R. van Oosten (San Marino, California, U.S.A.)
My adventures with birds started when I was born, but it took me
until my fifteenth birthday to realize that fact. My father had always
kept a large cage of African finches in the house and these always used
to fascinate me. In 1941 we moved to California and, once settled
here, he built an aviary which housed common finches and parrakeets.
Right after the war years we built another aviary, smaller, which
would enable us to house our finches separately. Then in 1948 I came
across a copy of Aviculture and with that my adventures really began. In
the issue was an article written by Mr. A. H. Isenberg on the breeding
of some Alcippes. I promptly wrote him regarding softbills and where
it might be possible to obtain some. His answer put me in contact
with another grand gentleman, Mr. Ray Thomas, whom I met and
had a chance first-hand to see my first softbills. Through both these
men I learned how to keep and take care of these beautiful gems.
I owe a great deal to them, for had it not been for their advice and
assistance I might never have become interested in birds.
In the early months of 1949, while driving back to Los Angeles,
I stopped at a pet shop and purchased my first pair of softbills for
the sum of 25 dollars--a pair of White-cheeked Bulbuls. Since that
time one might say that I have become a " bird-nut ", for my love for
birds grows more with each passing day and at present being only
twenty-two I can look forward to many enjoyable years with birds.
Besides the two above aviaries we now have three large ones for
the various size softbills--large, medium, and small. The large-size
aviary houses Toucans, Magpies, Jays, etc., and is planted with various
bushes and small trees and includes an orange tree. It is 18 feet long,
15 feet wide, and 12 feet high with an added shelter on the outside,
enclosed except for two windows and the front. The aviary for
medium-sized softbills is 36 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 10 feet high
with an adjoining shelter 21 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 7 feet high.
The shelter is divided into two parts so that food may be placed in
two separate places in order to eliminate fights. This aviary contains
Jay-Thrushes, Jays, Thrushes, Barbets, Sibias, Starlings, Troupials,
etc., and is likewise planted with bushes, small trees, and one orange
tree. The last one is our " glass house " aviary for the small birds
such as Tanagers, Sugar Birds, Redstarts, Bulbuls, etc. The house is
24 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 8 feet high with an adjoining flight
15 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 9 feet high. Both the house and the
flight are planted with small bushes, vines, grasses, and a few small
trees. Also in this aviary we built a two-tiered running waterfall
which the birds seem to enjoy greatly as it draws many insects and
bacteria. All the perches and swings in the three aviaries are dead

ree branches, which I feel helps to simulate natural surroundings as
v r ell as making the aviary look more artistic.
To-day one does not read very much about softbills so I decided to
^rite an article for the Magazine, giving some of my experiences
dth the birds in my collection. It is further hoped that this may spur
m other collectors of softbills to write on their birds as they may have
witnessed things which would be of interest to other enthusiasts.
The most outstanding event in my collection thus far was my
Drtunate success in raising two hybrid Mynahs this year. Housed in
he " glass house " were a beautiful pair of Grey-headed Mynahs
vhich have been here for three years. While away at college the
ten was lost and the cause of death not determined. In the same
nclosure were also two pairs and an extra hen Pagoda Mynah which
rave been here for six years. Early this year the male Grey-headed
hose the odd female Pagoda as his mate. I had hopes that the two
night breed and sure enough they did two months later. As both these
&gt;irds are well known to aviculture I see no reason for going into
letails of their respective descriptions. It might be worth mentioning,
lowever, that the females of both species are easy to sex. I have
bund that the females are all a shade lighter than the males, and
his is especially noticeable if the birds are in the sun or upon close
nspection of three or more birds.
The pair settled down and by April had chosen a redwood stained
)arrakeet nest-box as their nesting site. The only materials used in
)uilding were twigs and a few feathers. The material was slanted
rom the opening down to the back with the eggs being laid in one
:orner. As I was unable to be home all the time no accurate record
vas kept. However, four eggs were laid and four young hatched by
he middle of June. One youngster disappeared after four days and
[ suspect that the male Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock was responsible,
^oon after, four days later, another baby was found dead in the nest.
The two remaining are now fully feathered and not dependent upon
heir parents.
The youngsters were fed my formula egg-food mixture, soaked
;urrants, all sorts of fruit--apple, grapes, tomato, pear, banana--
nilk sop, canned dog food, and Mockingbird food. The only live
ood which was used was live fruit-flies which I propagate within the
iviary by filling half-way a 5-lb. lard can with fruit rinds. I find that
:here is no odour and hundreds of live flies, which all the birds love,
ire produced.
Both youngsters show very little colour beyond grey. The wings,
oack, rump, and tail are a deep powder grey. Head, neck, chest,
oelly, and vent are a very light powder grey, in which they resemble
their father. The bill, feet, and eyes are also the same as their father's.
There seem to be some black feathers coming on the crest of the

head, as in the Pagoda, but only the next moult will show for sure
Beyond this they show none of the colour or other characteristics 0
their mother. Their size is between the two, but this may change
when they reach maturity. Needless to say, sexing is not yet possible
although one seems a little brighter than the other. They have ai
present all the antics of their father as they are always chirupping and
running around in a never-ending search for bugs. I will write furthei
on these two birds after they pass their first moult.
Another unique nesting took place in the " glass house " by a pair
of Pope Cardinals which each year for the last four years have main-
tained two nests at the same time. Both birds have been seer
entering the nests and at times neither one was seen, and upon my
entering the " glass house " each would come out of a nest. They
nested twice each year, during the spring and summer, and as yei
have never reared a young one. This is due to the lack of mealworms ,
which are only fed during the winter months. They have never been
observed catching or eating fruit-flies so this no doubt is where the
trouble comes in. Unfortunately, I am not home so am unable tc
feed the live food required ; however, I feel that both broods could
be reared if the live food were supplied. There are always four eggs
in each nest and four youngsters hatch.
About two years ago my male White-cheeked Bulbul died of old age.
The pair had been very devoted to each other, but as soon as the
male was gone the hen promptly killed my female White-eared Bulbul
and mated with the male. They had one nest each year, but the
youngsters just vanished into thin air. They built the nests in a
canary-type outside cage-nest. The nest was covered with palm leaves
on the sides and the top, leaving the front open. The nests were
constructed of dried grasses, twigs, and feathers, and lined with string
and cotton. Two eggs were always laid and the hen sat close at all
times ; she was fed by the male. This year no nest was built as the
hen is rather old and cannot fly very well although she is in perfect
condition. The White-eared male is a most devoted husband and sits
with her most of the day and preens her feathers. He also hawks
fruit-flies which he feeds her, as he seems to know that she is unable
to fly very well.
In the summer of 1954 while sitting in the aviary taking notes, all
of a sudden I found the cause of the disappearing Bulbul youngsters.
Hovering outside the nest like a Humming Bird the Scarlet Cock-of-the-
Rock reached in with his beak and took one of the young. He then
flew to a perch where he struck it a few times and then swallowed it
whole. Needless to say, the babies were not more than a few days
old. Had I not seen it then and again on other occasions I would
never have believed it. The guilty party was believed to be a male
Orange-headed Ground Thrush. Because of lack of space I was unable

others the White-eyes or Yuhinas which sleep near him at night.
4 rs. Erlanger some years ago had babies from Cocks-of-the-Rock
nd she fed them baby mice. It is very possible that breeding these
wely birds might be achieved by feeding some of the larger live
)od, such as baby mice and rats.
Another attempted nesting took place this summer but met with
lilure. The pair consisted of a male Orange-headed Ground Thrush
nd a female White-throated Ground Thrush, both birds had been
nported from India in 1950. Up till two years ago I only suspected
he sex, but I could not be sure. The female Orange-headed had to
e placed in the medium-sized softbill aviary for fear that the male
/ould kill her. However, the White-throated was left in as he took
o notice of her. The male was much deeper in colour than the female
nd was heard singing on a few occasions. This year there was no
oubt that they were a pair as one egg was laid and sat on for five
ays before it was broken. During this time the male was never more
lan 5 feet away from the nest and any bird coming too close was at once
hased off. I have found these birds to be very nervous and no doubt
his caused the failure because if anyone came to the aviary the
imale would leave the nest. The nest was built 4 feet off the ground
1 the right-hand front corner of the aviary in a small, but thick,
pruce tree. The tree was right behind the waterfall and could not
e seen from outside the aviary even though the nest was 2 feet from
he wire. The nest itself reminded one strongly of a dove's nest,
lthough it had a sort of a mud plaster holding the bottom together.
Jpon closer inspection I noticed that twigs had been laid between
wo branches, then some twigs placed in the opposite direction and
overed with mud. The nest was roughly lined with grass and a few
iaves. No further attempt was made by these birds, although both
/ere seen carrying twigs on several occasions.
I have found that both these birds are very friendly towards other
irds. At present there is an English Robin in with them and they
ake no notice of him. Also a pair of White-capped Redstarts had
&gt;een kept in the same cage and not once had the Ground Thrushes
een seen chasing them or even paying them any heed. This also
olds true for a female Rainbow Bunting that always seems to get
he fruit-fly just at the moment the Orange-headed is reaching for it.
dso at one time a Shama Thrush had been in the same aviary with
he same good results. One day by accident my father turned loose

By David M. West (Montebello, Calif., U.S.A.)
Last year one of the more interesting breeding successes was the
aring of four young hybrid Brown's x Yellow Rosella {P. flaveolus).
Last fall I finally despaired of obtaining proper mates for the male
rown's and the female Yellow Rosella, so it was decided to put the
vo birds together and attempt to produce some hybrids. From the
iry first minute of introduction the two birds agreed, despite the
Terence in size between the smaller Brown's Rosella and the larger
male Yellow Rosella. Formerly, when paired to a female Brown's,
Le cock was quite given to driving his mate about, but he did not
intinue this practice with the Yellow Rosella hen. Apparently
sr greater size impressed him, and he made his advances to her
ith the greatest of care.
During March the pair were frequently seen feeding and the
)ck Brown's displayed to his mate almost every morning. Two large
sst-boxes were put up about the middle of March and the pair were
ten seen visiting the boxes after this. By April it was apparent that
le hen was most seriously interested in the smaller of the two boxes,
ad much of the sawdust and wood chips were being ejected by her.
1 late April the pair were observed mating, and shortly after that
le hen disappeared into the box.
No investigation was made during incubation ; as the hen would
[ways tumble back into the box upon seeing anyone approaching,
he first opportunity to investigate the contents of the nest-box was
a 16th May, when the temperature was well over ioo degrees and
le hen was off the box. The nest was observed to contain four nice
oungsters that were probably just five or six days old, and very
bsely intertwined.
During the period the young were in the box both parents fed
lem, and the male was frequently observed to enter the box to do
is fair share. The usual grains, fruit, and extras in the form of greens
r ere given and both parents spent large amounts of time caring for the
rowing family.
The first two youngsters left the nest when about five weeks old.

They were excellent fliers and very steady. The second two youngsters
left the nest two days later, and they too were steady and quite tame.
Before the second two left the nest the mother had laid again, and is
now incubating.
As this cross has not, apparently, been achieved before, a short
description of the youngsters may be of interest. They are best
described as almost completely resembling their mother--being quite
identical in coloration with her save for the fact that they have pale
orange under tail-coverts where the true Yellow Rosella has pale
yellow under tail-coverts. There are also a few pale orange feathers
on their breasts--but otherwise they are closely akin to young Yellow
Rosellas. This similarity to the mother is rather surprising, for I
had rather thought that they would resemble a combination of the
two parents which are quite different from each other. Still, crosses
between the widely different Pennant's X Barnard's result in young
that are so nearly pure Barnard's in appearance that only an expert
would be able to tell the difference.
Eventually I anticipate breeding the young male hybrids back to
their Yellow Rosella mother, and see if the resultant young are not
good enough to try and re-establish the Yellow Rosella in my collec-
tion for new imports are out of the question, and the Yellow Rosella
is very scarce in the U.S.A.

THE STORY OF A BLUE CROSSOPTILON

a kind of baksheesh, as my own life has become after being saved by
the drug " Cortisone ". Towards the end of a very long illness, my
kind friend Fred Logan (who came to my rescue when the person who
was looking after my collection suddenly disappeared, with the result
of the loss of nearly half the birds) set a quantity of pheasant eggs.
These all duly hatched, were reared, and most of them given to
friends. However, there were five eggs left over, we did not know of
what species they were or how old. Mr. Logan went to a good deal of
trouble, as it was then late in the season to get a broody bantam. At
that time I was well enough to do a few chores connected with the
birds and one was to see after the bantam hen.
The chicks from the first lot of eggs were now quite large. From their
earliest chickenhood, with the aid of the gardener, we moved their pens
to fresh ground every day . . . but, Oh ! . . . the damage the young
Crossoptilons did to my nice smooth lawns ! In fact they have not
recovered yet.

Crossoptilons, being mainly root feeders, dig for their living, and
row those chicks dug ! At the end of each day there were dozens of
loles in the sward into each of which one could put a tennis ball.
Every evening the bantam was taken off the eggs, but she was in
&gt;uch a state of broodiness that she used to rush back on to them as soon
is she was lifted off. To stop this the grille in front of the coop was
placed back until she had finished feeding.
One day the housekeeper came to say that there was a long-distance
:all on the telephone. Now the aviaries are at the bottom end of a small
Drchard and quite a distance from the house. By the time I had heard
most of the " birdy " gossip from London the hen and the eggs had
been clean forgotten. Next day, about 6 p.m., the hen was seen sitting
disconsolately before the grille and the eggs stone cold after twenty-
four hours' exposure on a rather cold day and night. Not wanting
anyone to realize what a fool I had been, I decided to let the hen sit
out the allotted span and then throw the eggs away, saying they must
have been stale and had not germinated.
Ten days after the normal incubation period I thought it would be
better to smash one of the eggs to see if they really were bad. The egg
was flung with much force on to the hard gravel, but nothing happened.
The process was then repeated with much more vigour, this time the
shell cracked and blood poured out and a faint cheeping was heard ;
on picking up the damaged egg a tiny beak was seen apparently gasping
its last. Believing in the old adage " while there's life there's hope ",
the much-damaged egg was put back under the hen. The next day the
shell had disappeared and running about at lightning speed was a
beautiful little Crossoptilon chick. I believe the Chinese name
" Manchee " means the bird that can run faster than a horse. I can
guarantee that no one on foot could ever be able to overtake one of
these birds.
The next day another little chick was seen, but alas, just as the grille
was being lowered between the coop and the run it shot out from under
the hen into the run, the grille fell on the bird's neck and after a few
convulsive struggles the tiny body flopped over, became limp, and
appeared to breathe its last. Being in a hurry I left the body until later
in the day, but when I came to the birds again it wasn't there and the
next day two very lively chicks were seen running about the pen. 1 hey
flourished exceedingly, until they were too big for the run and were
then put with their older brothers and sisters, who chivvied them
around with their mock fights and kept them from the food dishes.
The two poor twins started to grow listless and mope, they became
dejected and ill so, having nowhere to put them, I set them free in the
orchard. At first they hung about the birdroom, looking for scraps of
food and odd mealworms which managed to get out of the breeding
box. In the course of time they grew much better, due to feeding on

all manner of things, grass in particular, and, to my sorrow, rare bult
species which they dug out of the rockeries. Gradually the menu was
extended to include all manner of things, raspberries, alpine straw-
berries (Frais du bois ), insects ; they played havoc with the lettuce bee
in the kitchen garden, and all the time they dug everywhere, but meal-
worms proved the factor which rendered them tamer than domestic
poultry. Used properly, mealworms will tame almost any bird. The
larger of the two we called " Emma ", in remembrance of a female
given to me many years ago by Mr. Delacour, a bird of great character
However, " Emma " turned out to be a male and his mate a female
The latter was always shyer than her brother, in fact when first let oul
she was very wild and, indeed, I often thought she would fly away,
in fact she once did, but we got her back again. It is useless to pinior
these birds when chicks, for besides their swiftness they are remarkable
for their jumping propensities, they can easily leap on to a 8 or 9 ft
fence or shed. And it's next to impossible to catch a Crossoptilon when
once thoroughly frightened unless it is cornered, and it is never wise
to handle them, for no bird loses its feathers so quickly. When one oj
these birds has lost its confidence in humans only complete incarcera-
tion will keep it from flying or running away.
For a long time after the male became so tame the female stayed in
the background. " Emma " always thought of me as another Cros-
soptilon and, in the manner of his species, he talked to me all the time
I was around. A better scientific name for the species would be
C. garrulax ! All the time these birds are together they hold long con-
versations with each other. Beebe mentions this in his study of the
birds in their native state. In time I learned quite a bit of their language
and what a rather loud, snake-like hiss, which is very seldom heard in
captivity, means, which is " I am not annoyed but I don't like what
you are doing ". The pair would go every day to their parents' aviary
and spend many hours conversing with them. " Emma " seems to have
a great aversion to the glass vessels which are used for the nectar-
feeding birds, these he will take up when they are being collected or
being washed and will deliberately break them one by one. Why he
does this I can never make out.
He would jump on to my knee if I was sitting down and let me handle
any part of him, but he usually hissed when I touched his tail, though
he did not move away. The tail of the Blue Crossoptilon is remarkable
in that it is composed of twenty-four feathers, which is more than that
of most other birds except the Bulwer's Pheasant. The central feathers
are from 18 to 24 inches long and the ends curve downwards, the
webs are very disintegrated and are like long fine hairs and in old
birds are 8 to 1 o inches long and when used in the plumage trade are
known as " glycerined ostrich feathers ". The outer tail feathers are
normal, the lower half being white and the end half being iridescent

teel-blue. The outer and middle tail feathers gradually integrate one
vith another, in a manner difficult to explain.
One unfortunate thing about the Crossoptilons is that they are very
)rone to feather biting, not of their own plumage but that of their
nates. As they usually roost together, head to tail, they indulge in a
dnd of feather-biting competition, which soon renders their nether
egions a very unsightly mess. I keep the hen separate from the cock,
except during the breeding season, this seems to be the only way of
ceeping their plumage perfect.
On the whole the birds are very good tempered, except with other
pecies of pheasants, which they will immediately start to kill. Even if
me catches the victim in time the aggressors will continue their
ittacks by jumping up and pecking it when one is carrying it out of the
iviary. With all other species I have found them perfectly safe, though
hey will not stand any interference from any bird. One pair share an
iviary with a pair of Choughs and when these were first placed with
he Crossoptilons they commenced, in the usual crow-like way, to
;ease and play jokes on their companions ; they very soon put the
Choughs in their place and woe betide them if they ever try any tricks
:hese days.
Strange to say, these two species are also companions in the high and
remote regions which is their native habitat, at from 10,000 to
16,000 feet. Amongst themselves they are very peaceful, except when
yDung they indulge in a great deal of mock fighting, perhaps more so
than any other pheasant, but when they have got rid of their youthful
inhibitions no bird could be less aggressive ; in a wild state they are
highly gregarious.
Feather biting is even worse in the Brown species and one rarely
sees one of these birds whose feathers are not completely ruined by this
unfortunate habit. Of course, if one has a big enough estate the best
thing is to have them loose, like domestic fowls ; they will stay around
the house, but are apt on occasions to wander, though if left alone they
always come back, but the sight of so strange a bird as a Crossoptilon
is sure to cause a hue and cry and the poor bird is so chivvied and
chased by both humans and dogs that it loses its sense of direction as
in the end it is chased further and further away from its home.
Another thing, with keeping the birds at liberty they are certainly
not a gardener's friend and, leaving rare bulbs, etc., aside, they are apt
to think that one's kitchen garden produce is grown solely for them and,
in the end, one has to resort to the local greengrocer for one's vegetables.
If one does not mind all this, one will have delightfully tame and
intelligent pets which are also feather perfect, and a feather perfect and
tame Crossoptilon is a very beautiful creature.
It seems a pity that these extremely interesting birds, which look like
meeting with extinction in the near future (in fact, the Brown species

is thought to have become almost extinct through killing and deforesta-
tion in its native haunts on the mountains of Shansi and Chihli, ir
North-western China) are not more widely kept and bred, for no birds
are easier to rear than these. One wonders what will happen to the
genus Crossoptilon now that Tibet, Szechuan, Yunnan, Shansi,
Kokonor, and Kansu, the home of these birds, have been " liberated ",
as the Communists call their occupation, from the domination o
Buddhism, a gentle and enlightened religion which teaches the
sanctity of all life. One wonders too, what will happen to the other
splendid pheasants, of which we know so little, which inhabit those
lofty regions, the Chinese and Sclater's Monal's (I consider mysell
very lucky to have seen living specimens of the former, one of the mosl
magnificent of pheasants, when in China in 1936, being one of the very
few Europeans to have done so. These birds were later shipped tc
Europe but died en route), the Tragopans, the Koklass, and the uniquely
coloured Blood Pheasants (of which it seems less than ten individuals
have ever reached Europe and of which thirteen sub-species are known),
not to mention various other species.
After reading the late Hachisuka's recently published book on the
extinct birds of the Mascarene Islands, in which we read " nc
other part of the world . . . contained such an extraordinary avi-
fauna . . . and nowhere was the destruction more rapid or complete '
one contemplates on the question, if Buddhists had discovered these
fair islands would we not have with us to-day all those many and
fantastic forms of avian life, which were so swiftly swept to oblivion
after the discovery and occupation by the Portuguese, Dutch, French,
and English, and which for untold aeons of time had known no enemies
until so-called Christian Man came on the scene. Forty-seven
species were exterminated, including a huge 6 ft. high, white and red
water-hen, the giant black Ground Parrots and, amongst others, the
very Dodo itself. There may have been other species, we shall nevei
know, for all we have to tell us of those exterminated are an odd stuffed
specimen or two, a few bones and skeletons, notes in ancient manu-
scripts, or mention in some aged tomes on travel written by those whe
visited those far distant isles, the reading of which leaves the bird-
loving ornithologist sick at heart at the sadistic ways of mankind. Sad
to say, the same story is being enacted all over the world to-day, ir
spite of the endeavours of those who try to preserve our great heritage.
To get back to Crossoptilons, when in California a few years age
I saw hybrids between the White and Blue species. In shape they were
exactly like the Blue, which is different to that of the White. These
birds were most beautiful and attractive, being of a pale lavender blue.
I do not know if any of them are left as I understand that Mr. Gibson,
on whose ranch I saw them, has disposed of all his vast collection ol
birds. As mentioned before, it is not known if the Brown Crossoptilor

till exists in its natural habitat, which was the western mountain
anges of Shansi and Chilli, in China, most parts of which have become
Tactically desert regions with the continual deforestation and
absequent erosion. It seems to have been introduced into Europe
early a hundred years ago and since then few wild specimens have
cached us. The breed is therefore very inbred, which accounts for the
yw fertility of the eggs. To save this bird it seems that it will be
ecessary to cross it with the Blue to ensure fresh and stronger blood
nd then breed back again to the pure Brown. Though a free breeder
Ten it first arrived here, it is becoming very much rarer in captivity

As to the White Crossoptilons, very few Europeans have ever seen
rese in their native haunts, as they live in probably the most inaccessible
nd remote parts of the world and which, no doubt, will always remain
) owing to the difficulty of any transport ever reaching there. Their
abitat is in the high Eastern Himalayas, in that part of the world
Tere Tibet, Burma, and China meet. We are told they range from
0,000 to 16,000 feet and upwards. The existence of these birds has
een perpetuated by the influence of the kindly Buddhist monks, whose
imastries are situated in those lofty and distant regions. I was
)rtunate enough to see some of these wonderful birds whilst in
California, where a few were sent in 1936. Unfortunately they are not
rolific like their congenitors and very few are bred. These lovely
irds are snow-white, their immaculate plumage being set off by the
:arlet face and legs and the brilliant, iridescent, purple-blue tail
athers. The story of how the first Blue Crossoptilons were procured
1 1929 and of how they were first carried in baskets by coolies, then on
le backs of donkeys, and finally by river boat during a journey of
ver six months' duration from Kansu, in the far interior of China,
weral thousand miles to Shanghai, is told by Herr Hampe and
uoted by Mr. Jean Delacour in his fine book The Pheasants of the World ,

BLUE RINGNECK PARRAKEETS AND A

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I thought the accompanying photograph of the brood of five young
Blue Ringneck Parrakeets bred here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm
during the 1956 season might be of interest. They are the progeny
of the late Duke of Bedford's famous original breeding pair of these
birds, which came to Keston on his death and have since reared ten
young ones in all--one in 1954 j four in 1955 &gt; amd five in 195E
Incidentally, their latest brood is, in my experience, just one more than
Ringnecks generally produce--their broods usually consisting of
threes and fours.
When one takes into consideration the fact that they had already
reared numerous young ones at Woburn before they came to us, it will
be seen that, in sharp and refreshing contrast to most rare and beautiful
colour " sports " they are a truly wonderful breeding pair, even judged
by normal standards. Nor is this the only respect in which they are
remarkable, for the attitude of the sexes one to the other is in their case
reversed. Usually, of course, with Ringnecks, it is the hen who " wears
the trousers " and is often very snappy and short-tempered with the
cock, except when she is actually in breeding condition.
With these two, however, the position is exactly the opposite, the
cock being at all times the master and lunging at his wife should she
attempt to sit too close to him, and I have even seen him do this during
the breeding season, though a few moments before he had been feeding
her as she put her head out of the nest-box. It may be remembered
that the late Duke referred to him as a bird of funny and uncertain
temper and thought he might eventually need careful watching with
his newly fledged family, although I must say I have always found him
entirely exemplary in this respect and a model parent in every way.
Altogether he adopts a typically mid-Victorian attitude towards his
wife, but in extenuation it must be said that the number of their
offspring is comparatively quite up to mid-Victorian standards, too !
I only wish the accompanying photograph could be in colour, and
for those who may never have seen a Blue Ringneck I would add that
they are extremely beautiful birds of a soft yet rich shade of powder
blue which, in the cock, is particularly vivid on the crown and fore-
head and which makes a lovely colour contrast to the coral red oi
the bill.
While on the subject of Ringnecks, I think a short account of a very
unusual and colourful Ringneck " sport " we have might be 0:
interest, as it is the only one of its kind I have ever seen. It wa^
discovered in one of the London bird shops by our General Manager

vlr. Cummings, and I would call it a pied Ringneck, as its appearance
3 somewhat reminiscent of a green and yellow pied or harlequin
ludgerigar.
It is not an easy bird to describe but I hope the following may give,
my way, a rough idea of its general appearance. It is a cock and is in
:very other respect a normal green, except for the large areas of bright
r ellow in its plumage and the fact that the two central tail feathers are
&gt;articularly blue, being only faintly tinged with green, while the outer
&gt;nes are mainly yellow. The usual black and pink neck-rings are
&gt;resent, as is the area of bluish-mauve at the back of the head, but on
he head itself there is some yellow in the region of the forehead. The
nantle and the flight feathers are pure bright yellow, while the upper
&gt;reast is yellow of a rather paler shade merging into green on the lower
&gt;reast and belly.
It is a great pity that, with the Ringneck family, the breeding of
olour varieties is such a very long-winded process, but I suppose the
ventual hopes from this bird would be that, about a decade hence,
t might be the ancestor of evenly marked pieds and normal-eyed
ellows--as opposed to pink-eyed lutinos. I only wish the present state
&gt;f the world was stable enough to allow one to hope that such long-
erm projects had a reasonable prospect of eventual fruition.
Unlike in the days of my youth--planning ahead seems, nowadays,
he essence of folly--nevertheless, I cheerfully go on doing it !

During the past spring and summer the weather can, with justifica-

Continuous rain and cold in June and July caused havoc, particularly
vith the ducklings. One recalls two heart breaking weeks in June when
&gt;ver a hundred babies were lost from chilling and allied troubles.
Nevertheless, it was a pleasant surprise when figures were assessed at

sixteen that hatched fifteen were reared, and a further three wen
reared from a pair under the care of Mr. Terry Jones, at Leckford.
Cuban Whistling Duck ( Dendrocygna arborea), Wandering Whistling
Duck ( Dendrocygna arcuata arcuata), Magpie Goose ( Anseranas semi-
palmata ), Bewick's Swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Lesser Scauj
(.Aythya affinis), Comb Duck ( Sarkidiornis melanotos) and the Soutl
American Comb Duck ( Sarkidiornis melanotos carunclatus) , Commor
Golden-eye ( Buecephala clangula clangula ), Goosander (Mergus merganser
merganser ), were reared for the first time at Slimbridge, indeed, the Iasi
seven kinds, we believe, for the first time in England.
Some notes on the Bewick's swans have already been given. Of th(
rest, by far the most interesting is the breeding of the Magpie Goose
We have in our collection a pair imported from Sydney in 1949 and ar
old female which has been in this country since pre-war days. They an
kept in our Wood pen along with a pair of Black Swans, Whistling
Ducks, and Muscovys. There is a 4 ft. privet hedge bounding th&lt;
pen on one side and it was in this that in 1955 a male was found to b&lt;
making the rudiments of a nest. The activity was soon abandonee
and when a similar occurrence took place this year we were not unduh
elated. However, some days later the old female joined the male ir
building a second nest on the ground, some two or three yards from th&lt;
original site, composed of twigs, straw, and nettles, very like that of i
swan in design. In the course of the next four weeks a further fiv"
nests were built in the nettles at the back of the pen and during th*
last week the female was seen to be getting very heavy. On 15th Augus
she was sitting on the latest nest. When approached she emitted &lt;
high-pitched scream and the male came striding to her assistance. Botl
birds stood on the nest with tails in the air, heads lowered, and wing
outspread and one could see the first roundish white egg had been laid
During the next twelve days a further seven eggs were laid. They hac
roughish shells and were dead white in colour. The average size beim
73 X 56 mm. and weight 115-3 gm. As the eggs were laid they wen
replaced by dummies and when the clutch was completed two rea
eggs were left in the nest for a few days after incubation commenced
It was found that both birds shared in the sitting and that the egg
were never left. The two eggs were removed and added to those tha
had been placed under the broody bantam. For the rest of the incuba
tion period, when the broodies were being fed and exercised, the egg
were kept warm by use of a spare bantam. An incubation period c
around thirty-five days was expected and it was with some surpris 1
that we found the first egg chipped after twenty-seven days. Fiv
goslings hatched on the 28th day, the other three eggs being infertile
The downy young are striking little things, quite unlike those of an&apos;

rey above, with an absence of barring, and the under parts a pale
rey. The bill, yellow in colour, is large and powerful, the nail being
articularly prominent, and the lores are bare. The toes are very large
1 proportion to the rest of the gosling and the yellow tarsus is very
:urdy. These babies were very aggressive to each other and had great
ecking matches as soon as they were able to stand. The diet con-
sted of soaked biscuit-meal with a 25 per cent protein content,
lentiful supplies of duckweek, chopped plantain, grass, and lettuce,
&quot;hey were given quantities of fresh-water shrimps and these they pre-
&apos;rred to all else. When food was given to them they would emit a high-
itched sibilant call, similar to that of passerine nestlings at the
pproach of the parent bird. Feathering commenced at twenty-five
ays and at the same time the bill began to turn black. The down was
)st completely at six weeks and the adolescent plumage was a black
ead and neck, mantle, and upper parts, except for a white rump,
ath the under parts and breast shaded from pale grey to white. The
yes do not as yet give the impression of being so far round on to the
ontal aspect of the head as in the parent birds and one is not conscious
f their use of binocular vision as in the adults. The forehead is not yet
are and the characteristic bump not yet developed.
A South American Comb Duck bred at New Grounds in 1955
ut lost its brood within two days. In 1956 three South American Comb
)uck and one of the Old World race nested. In each case the eggs
r ere laid in little grape barrels that had been sited some two or three
:et above the ground in willow trees. The incubation period was
lirty-one days for both forms. The creamy white eggs had a thin,
liny shell and the average size for twenty-five specimens was
7x37 mm. and average weight 44 gm.
The ducklings are obviously near relations of the Muscovy as
igards shape and dual colouring of the tarsus. The downy pattern
as cap, back of the neck, and upper parts of the body brown, the
ings and body being barred with yellow. There was a brown eye-
ripe and the throat, breast, and under parts were yellow.
The first hatching did not thrive at all and showed little inclination
) feed. They soon succumbed in the cold, wet weather. The use of
ifra-red lamps had a very favourable effect on subsequent broods,
he ducklings showed great interest in life, ate well and, apart from one
r two weaklings, grew rapidly.

By Gerner Petersen (Glostrup, Denmark)
(Reprinted, by kind permission, from Stuekultur , March and April nos.,
1956. Translated by Paul Hansen.)
In December, 1951, I bought two Senegal Parrots, which later
turned out to be two cocks ; one died in September, 1953, but the
following day I was lucky enough to be able to buy a female. When
I placed it with the cock they immediately showed great interest,
and were very pleased with each other.
In the summer of 1954 the pair was placed in an outside aviary
with a nest-box, which seemed to interest them but, apparently on
account of too much disturbance from the other birds in the aviary,
they did not show any signs of breeding.
In spring, 1955, we tried again, this time indoors (in my bedroom,
which faces north), in a parrot cage measuring 44 cm. by 44 cm. with
a height of 60 cm., and with a nest-box measuring 25 cm. by 25 cm.
and 35 cm. in height placed outside on the cage, which was put
against a warm chimney. On the 17th March the first egg appeared
and, with a day between each, in all four were laid ; one of them,
however, was destroyed. On the 15th April the first sounds of young
were heard from the nest-box, and examination showed two
youngsters, but one died on the 20th April and the other on the 27th.
In the summer of 1955 I tried again in the garden aviary, also
without any results on account of disturbances. In October, 1955,
the birds again were placed indoors in the parrot cage with the nest-
box on the outside. The birds were mating and were apparently in
very fine condition. The first egg was laid on the 2nd January, 1956,
and three in all appeared.
During the whole period of incubation both the parents spent the
time in the nest, only one at the time coming out for feeding.
The 27th January sounds were heard from two youngsters ; one of
them, however, died on the 2nd February, though the other was
thriving very well.
As soon as the hen left the nest, which at first she only did in order
to relieve herself, the youngster kept up a continual noise until she
came back. During the first four weeks the cock was feeding both
the young and the hen. The young had quite white down.
As rearing food I used sprouted seed in a mixture of sunflower
seed, hemp, canary, white and golden millet, and dry seed in the
same mixture ; in addition, plenty of millet
and apples. In the bottom of the nest-box w
peat-moss.

When the youngster was five weeks old the feathers started to grow,
first on the head, afterwards on the wings and the tail, and lastly on
the body. The eyes were very dark, but at approximately ten weeks
the yellow rings started to show very faintly, but at the time of writing
(April, 1956) are not yet very colourful.
The first feathers were very dull in colour, but when the young
left the nest, at nine weeks old, it was fully feathered and the colours
most beautiful and clear like the colours of the parents. Before it
left the nest the parents had been calling for it for some time, enticing
it to take the great step out in the world, but it never went further
than looking out of the nest-hole, and here it was fed. It was very
early in the morning on the 30th March when it finally came out ;
at first it was very unsteady on the feet, but the unsteadiness very
soon left it altogether. Gradually the hen seemed less and less
interested in the young, leaving the cock to do all the feeding, at
which he was very good. Since ten weeks old it has been feeding for
itself, occasionally still begging a little from the cock.
The youngster, which is a little bigger than its parents, with a
comparatively smaller head and beak, looks very promising, is sound
and in fine condition, and starts every day with a good bath in the
bird-bath attached to the cage. I have had it in my hand a couple
of times ; it is very quiet and does not try to bite.

This lovely Australian psittacine has never been too easy to breed
here in California. The result is that they have always been scarce,
and the breeding records not too numerous.
In recent years the San Diego Zoo has had several successful
breedings, but in private collections the only recent result that comes
to mind is that of G. Rayson Brown's 1955 success with two young
reared.
My own two pairs have had a four-year record of every possible
vagary. They have laid every year, but sometimes they refused to
incubate, other times have laid from the perch, smashed the eggs,
deserted them, etc. It was, therefore, without much optimism that
I greeted the current breeding season.
This season (1956) both pairs appear to have turned over a new
leaf. To be sure both males continued driving and heckling their
mates, but every now and again they would stop long enough to
feed them ! The hens, apparently anxious to justify their long non-

productive sojourn in the collection, responded by beginning actual
nesting operations six weeks earlier than in any former year. By
2nd March both hens had disappeared from sight, and sat very
steadily until 24th March when young could be plainly heard. As
the nest-boxes were placed very high, and a small ladder would have
been needed to make an inspection, none was made. The usual
grandfather-clock nest was used, the bottom being filled with wood
chips and sawdust.
From the time the youngsters hatched until they emerged from the
nest, some five weeks later, the parents were perfect in every way and
gave me no worry whatsoever. Large amounts of food were consumed,
and during the first few weeks I was regularly carrying in three bucket-
fuls of poa annua to each pair daily. In addition, each pair were fed
canned corn that had been washed and rinsed in clear water before
being given to the parents. Of this they were terribly fond, and each
pair ate a small can of it daily. Both males fed their respective hens
assiduously, and after about two weeks the hens began to spend
longer periods away from the young. The males were only very
rarely seen actually to enter the box, and then rather hesitantly.
The first youngster appeared on about the thirty-fifth day and
looked smaller and duller than the mother. The others followed
within a few days, and were active and good flyers from the first.
Some of the youngsters have more red on the wing than others, but
this is apparently not a good or valid indication of sex. One of the
adult hens has much more red on the wing than the other hen.
The male parents have proved to be very tolerant of their off-
spring, and have not driven them about. This is in contrast to some
other species, as the Red-rump for example, which will sometimes
attack the youngsters if a second nest is planned.
The aviary of the first pair was 18 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 9 feet
high. The second pair were in an aviary about 24 feet long, 3 feet
wide, and 9 feet high. Both nest-boxes were hung under shelters,
and were filled with rough wood chips. In addition to the usual dry
seed mixture, seed was thrown on the dirt floors to sprout, and soft
food such as soaked bread, oats, etc., was also provided. Naturally,
large amounts of greens were provided, and fruit, such as orange,
apple, and fresh corn on the cob also provided, and relished.
I am very pleased to report this success, because Crimson-wings
are a little difficult to rear, and it has given me a great deal of pleasure
to be fortunate enough to rear some this year after four years of
negative results.
The first pair reared two, and the second pair reared two more.
Both pairs nested a second time--but one pair deserted their nest
during a heat wave in May. The other pair successfully reared
two more--thus making a total of six reared for the year.

By Hylton Blythe (Thorpe Bay, Essex, England)
For some years I have realized that breeding pairs of finches, both
British and foreign need more nutrition than is available in hard seed.
If necessary proteins and vitamins are absent in the spring diet the
eggs will be too poor in quality to sustain life until the chicks can be
fed by the parent birds, resulting in " dead in shell Then, if the
regurgitated food is lacking in essentials, chicks will fade out after a
few days.
In addition to the usual seeds and greenfood a soft food seems to be
the answer and after several years of unscientific experiments starting
from bread-and-milk, I evolved a food last year which proved very
successful.
This formula aims to provide a food which is hygenic and consistent
in quality and supplies high-class protein and the necessary vitamins
A..D.B. Bread rusk is used as being pure and free from mould and
consistent in quality. It is obtainable from the butchers quite cheaply.
Here is the formula :--

The C.L.O. is mixed with the peanut oil and added to the rusk, well
stirred in, and the other ingredients added. If feeding Softbills add

hr it will be decomposed and useless, if not actually unhealthy.
This mixture only needs to be moistened with water and allowed to
stand for a few minutes before crumbling. In hot weather add more
water.
Through the years several friends have tried out my experimental
batches and this latest mixture was successfully used with British and

The 46 classes allocated to foreign birds at the National Show
this year were the same number as at the 1956 event. With tht
exception of the class " For all seedeaters larger than a Java Sparrow "
which had no entry, the classes were well filled, and the total entn
was about 600.
Apart from the fact that there were a number of very rare exhibits
some being shown for the first time in this country, the average quality
of all the birds staged was extremely high. The majority of the placing
for seed-eaters were made by Mrs. E. M. Schenck and Mr. W. A
Upson, as were those in the classes for Starlings, Mynahs, Toucans
and Quails. Mr. J. J. Yealland and myself placed the rest of the soft
bills, also the seed-eater classes for Weavers, Whydahs, Gouldians
Australian, etc., finches, and other seed-eaters not larger than a Jaw
Sparrow. Mr. Claude M. Payne made the awards in the sections fo
parrot-like, abnormal coloured foreign, and hybrids with one or botl
parents foreign.
Mr. R. C. J. Sawyer, with exhibits shown in his usual immaculat
style, won the Ezra Memorial Cup, National Rosette, and Award c

A pair of Cormorants collected on Lambay Island during 1947,
:sted in January on the " cliff" in the Southern Aviary. Two eggs
sre laid and one chick, now about ten days old, has been seen.
The Cereopsis Geese that reared two goslings last year nested in
ecember, but none of the five fertile eggs was hatched. Another
utch of two is now being incubated.
Birds new to the Collection are a pair of Chinese Crossbills (Loxia
rvirostra albiventris) and a pair of Yellow-bellied Titmice (Parus
nuslulus) presented by Dr. K. C. Searle. The Crossbills much
semble the Common Crossbill--a little smaller, perhaps, but not,
the present plumage, appreciably whiter on the underparts. The
itmice are one of the smallest and prettiest species with their glossy
ack, white, yellow and greenish-grey plumage.
Mr. G. Newmark has sent a gift of a second Malachite-shouldered
ruitsucker or Leaf-bird, a Crested Mynah, and a Malaysian Black-
iped Oriole. Miss R. Ezra has presented two Golden Pheasants
id Messrs. Brooke Bond and Co. a Sulphur-breasted Toucan.
Monsieur Delacour's very interesting note on the diet of the
umming Birds kept in Brazil by Dr. Beraut and Mr. Ruschi brings
* mind the case of a female Sun Gem that has recently died after
dng here for i |years. Without knowing the age of the bird at the
me of its arrival and the expectation of life of these very small
umming Birds in the wild state, it would be impossible to judge

BIRDS OF SAURASHTRA, INDIA. ByR. S. Dharmakumarsinhj

F.Z.S., M.B.O.U. Published by R. S. Dharmakumarsinhji at D;
Bahar, Bhavnagar, Saurashtra, India. 1955. Price -#5 1 8 j . 6d.
The author is a well-known ornithologist who first started his interes
in birds while at his preparatory school in England. This book is th
result of more than fifteen years' study of the birds of Saurashtra, th
country lying on the west coast of India between the smaller projectioi
of Kutch and the straight line of the Gujerat coast. The author state
that most of Saurashtra is hilly, but that there is every variety of terrain
including desolate salt plains, flat land growing wheat and millel
open grass, and wooded hills. He adds that many of the birds found ii
Saurashtra are also found in Kutch, Gujerat, and South Rajasthan
so these areas have also been covered in the book and a special supple
ment has been added of notes on birds so far not recorded in Saurashtr.
but found in Kutch and Gujerat.
The first chapter is devoted to sections on migration, local migra
tions, the study of migration, migration routes, how birds travel, cok
as a factor affecting migratory birds, rain as affecting migration am
breeding, and sudden influxes of birds. The author says that nowhen
does rain play such an important part in local movements of birds as ii
India and refers to the hordes of birds he has seen appearing at th
time of the monsoon, which not only brings birds with it, but acts as;
breeding stimulus. Also in the first chapter are sections on brigh
plumage and bird song, how to study birds in the field and, finally
bird areas in Saurashtra. The author considers the Gir Forest and th&lt;
Girnar mountain as the best area for resident birds and points out tha
though most people know the Gir Forest as the habitat of the Indiai
lion, few know it as a bird sanctuary. He also stresses the important
of the entire Saurashtra coastline and of the Bhal district as the mail
migratory routes. In the second and third chapters, on a seaside seen*

n a February morning and an April day in the Gir Forest, the author
lakes his readers share his obvious pleasure and delight in the scene
y graphic descriptions of the surroundings and the birds.
There then follow full descriptions giving details, identification,
otes, distribution, nesting, and food of 357 species. The author is
keen falconer and introduces an interesting innovation by trying to
onvey, in his notes on the flights of trained falcons, how birds react to
ttacks from birds of prey and how they escape. There are 33 colour
dates depicting 282 species by Somalal Shah, 40 black and white
dates from photographs by the author and others, a colour photo-
raph frontispiece by the author, and 16 maps showing distribution and
ligration routes of various species. At the beginning of the book is a
etailed map of the area under review and at the end a map showing

The author has made an elaborate study of the Yellow-eyed Penguin,
Aegadyptes antipodes , in southern New Zealand, extending over
ighteen years. An earlier monograph dealt with Sexual Behaviour in
\enguins , and the present work is concerned mainly with detailed
bservations in various breeding areas within about twenty miles of
)unedin. Four areas were worked thoroughly each season, and it is
onsidered that practically all the breeding birds were found each
eason, and for some years nearly all resident non-breeding birds.
The data are presented in a series of tables dealing with first the
mgth of the pair-bond and such factors as divorce, separation, dis-
ppearance and death leading to its dissolution. The incubation
eriod seems to vary not only among individuals but between seasons,
&quot;he chick period lasts on the average about 106 days. The amount
f food received by chicks was determined by weighing the chicks
)ur times a day. An average of 818 grammes of food per day was
iven to two chicks in the last eighteen days of the guard stage, but
n. one day the total reached 1,418 grammes. The young birds
/andered considerably during the first five years, but then they
ecame mature and rarely moved to a new breeding place. Out of
II fledglings which entered the sea, 6 per cent returned to breed in
leir place of hatching, 8 per cent to the same area, 9 per cent to
ie nearest breeding area, and 7 per cent to a more distant area.

About 52 per cent are estimated to die, leaving a balance of 18 pei
cent which may breed in areas to the south of Otago Peninsula
Survival and mortality factors are given in detail, and the precise
composition of a penguin community. There is also a chapter on the
moulting season including comparisons with other species of penguins
It was essential for these studies to have some system of marking
and an aluminium band fixed on the tarsus was the method generally
adopted. The numbers were stamped on the band in four places, sc
that whichever way the bird was standing the number could be seer
and read by the aid of a telescope. Footmarking involving th&lt;
punching of six holes in the web of each foot proved much mon;
satisfactory, and according to the author, without it the material fo
this monograph would never have been obtained.
Whilst this is primarily a book for the specialist, the detailed stud;
of such an interesting bird will appeal to a much wider public.

FRENCH MOULT RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965195090909091" page_id="58073269"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
The National Council of Aviculture is sponsoring a three-year programme of
research into the cause of French Moult in Budgerigars, to be undertaken in the
Department of Agricultural Chemistry in the University of Reading. There is some
evidence that French Moult may, in certain cases, be associated with a quantitative
Dr qualitative deficiency in the crop-milk fed to the young chicks, and, as part of
[his investigation, we are studying the structure, development, and possible endocrine
control of the glands responsible for the production of this secretion.
A condition similar to French Moult has also been observed in some species of
ovebirds and in Red-rumps, and there is good reason to believe that all parrot-like
birds feed their young on crop-milk for at least the first week after hatching. We are
interested, therefore, in studying the structure of the milk-secreting glands in other
psittacine birds as well as in Budgerigars, and if any members of the Avicultural
Society are unfortunate enough to lose any of their birds while incubating or while
feeding young, we should be very glad if they would send the carcases to us, with
the date on which the first egg was laid, the date of death, and whether or not young
bad hatched.
It is not known whether the cock produces crop-milk as well as the hen, so birds
3f both sexes would be equally welcome. It is important that they should be sent
as soon after death as possible, and if any substantial delay occurs, it would be very
desirable if they were preserved in 5 per cent formalin, or failing this, in 50 per cent
methylated spirits. A small cut should be made in the body wall of the thorax and
abdomen to allow the preservative to enter and, after soaking in the liquid for a few
hours, the bird may be removed and packed in damp paper in a polythene bag for
postage.
The bodies of any young parrot-like birds which die while in the nest would also
be of great value for chemical investigation of their crop-contents.
We are hoping that this investigation will make a real contribution to the knowledge
of the physiology and nutrition of psittacine birds, and any help w&apos;hich members
are able to give will be greatly appreciated.
All specimens should be posted to me at the University.

BREEDING THE BLACK-BREASTED PLOVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96901152" page_id="58073269"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
After reading in the December number of our Magazine Mr. Gerrits very&apos; interesting
account of the breeding of the Australian Black-breasted Plover Z on \f er tricolor,
I would like to supplement his remarks by saying that after keeping two or three pairs
in the Lilford aviaries for some years, we found them charming subjects to possess and
considerably less difficult to maintain in health than some of the rarer British waders.
Our examples did well when kept in a large pool aviary with other waders. They
partook of the usual waders' mixture and would also eat wheat. I have no reliable
bistory of the species available, but should imagine they may frequent dry upland
pasture. Mention may be made of this because when purchased I found them in a
London store (Messrs. Chapmans) in excellent condition, but supplied with no other
food except a dish of dry, small, brownish-yellow millet seed. Unsuitable as this
appeared to me they were partaking of it freely and I was assured later that it was
the only food that had accompanied them on the voyage.
As to the breeding of the Black-breasted Plover in confinement I may add that as the
spring approached, paired pairs were better removed to quieter quarters. Therefore our
most promising pair were summered in a small aviary the whole floor space of which
consisted of a well kept miniature lawn 12 feet by 14 feet. Here, as described by
Mr. Gerrits, they made a beautiful rubbing or nest in the short turf and for two seasons
around 1930 reared their young, I believe a two and a three. From memory these
birds were very noisy and demonstrative at the nest but never seemed really to mind
their aviary being entered for supplying food. When the young were newly hatched,
however, it was advisable to note the exact position of each squatting chick before
stepping inside.
My diary of 1930-31 states the young were quite easy to rear.

The Wedge-tailed or Orange-breasted Sunbird was originally
iescribed in 1766 by Linnaeus when he named it Certhia violacea.
[t is the only member of its genus and its distribution is confined to
:he extreme south-west of Africa.
Stark {Fauna of South Africa , Birds , vol. 1) says : " The Orange-
Dreasted Sunbird frequents open uncultivated country, rough hill-
iides, and the slopes and summits of mountain ranges, and especially
\0x25A0vhere various heaths and proteas abound. It has a considerable
/ertical range, from sea-level to a height of 4,000 feet or more, and
3eing a hardy little bird, seemingly indifferent to cold and wet, it
s quite at home on the bleak and foggy mountains of the coast ranges
n Cape Colony."
Stark goes on to say : " These Sunbirds feed largely on the nectar of
/arious heaths, occasionally on that of proteas, also on small insects
:hat frequent these flowers, and on gnats and flies which they dart
apon, like Flycatchers, from a perch to which they constantly return.
Like the Long-tailed Cape Sugar Birds, they breed during the winter
&apos;ains, the nests near Cape Town being usually built in June and the
Jggs laid in July. This coincides with the flowering season of certain
leaths and proteas on whose nectar they feed their young. On one
occasion I found a nearly completed nest at the end of March. The
aest, oval and domed, with a small side entrance near the top, is built
T small flexible twigs of heath, dry grass, and narrow downy leaves,
:hickly lined with the soft white petals of a protea. It is not pendant
ike the nests of other Sunbirds, but is attached by its sides to the stalks
n the centre of a thick bush of heath, a foot or eighteen inches off
the ground. The eggs, two in number, are white dotted all over, but
most thickly round the greatest diameter, with small spots and streaks

of greyish brown. They measure 0.65 X 0.48. On one occasion
I noticed a female remove the eggs from a nest from which I had
startled her, and place them under some thick undergrowth a few feet
away. She apparently carried them in her bill. A second brood is
frequently reared in September and October. From December to
March these Sunbirds are generally in small family parties of four 01
six, the parents and their young, one of the band being nearly always
a male in full plumage, while one or two are young males showing
varying amounts of metallic plumage."
The flocking habit is interesting : this Sunbird certainly seem&apos;
less aggressive than many others. No doubt it would thrive--as indeed
do many of the more tropical ones--far better in an outdoor aviary
than in a cage and would need only a little warmth in the shelter
during winter. I once kept a pair in a large cage under quite cool
conditions and they did well, but then the following summer wher
I was away, both escaped and were not heard of again.

BREEDING GOLDEN-MANTLED ROSELLAS
SINCE 1951
By Dieter Overlander (Honnef/Rhein, Germany)

When I write " Golden-mantled " I do not intend to say that my
Rosellas are pure Golden-mantled but they look like them. I believe
that in Germany many, or most, of the birds so called are hybrids
or youngsters of hybrids, between cecilae and eximius. These " hybrids '
in many cases look like cecilae so far as the colour is concerned, but ir
size they seem to favour the larger eximius. But this is only an ide;
of mine and not proved.
I hope the reader will not be disappointed that this breeding
account is not a story of splendid successes.
In 1951 I obtained my first pair of Rosellas, an old cock and ;
young hen still in immature plumage. In the middle of April, 1952
the cock drove the hen through the aviary, but as this aviary is 12m
in length he could not harm her. Then I realized that she was to(
young and exchanged her for another belonging to my uncle. Thi
hen after being in the aviary for only eight days was fed by the cock
and ten days later she laid her first egg. Unfortunately, this firs
clutch, five eggs, was destroyed after two youngsters had hatchec
because the log fell to the ground. The parents stopped breeding fo
six weeks and then they had another clutch of three eggs, which al
hatched and were reared. But misfortune had not ceased as in winte
the old hen escaped. Some months later I was told that she ha
been caught, fed on poultry food, and then escaped again.

<bodyText confidence="0.995801" page_id="58073279"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
In 1953 I obtained another hen from a first nest of 1952. This hen,
hough still in immature plumage, had four eggs in one nest, three of
vhich hatched and were reared. Two other young pairs, two birds
)f which had been bred by myself, were doing nothing but feeding
)ccasionally and inspecting the nests. I suppose it is not so difficult
o breed from young hens as from young males.
In 1954 I had three pairs in full adult plumage and one young pair.
[ hoped to realize good results. The old pair had six eggs all of which
latched. The nestlings did well for a fortnight after emerging from
he shell, then the eldest fell ill. The down was wet and stuck to the
iody. Every second or third day I found another dead young one.
&apos; believe they all died from cold and wet weather.
The other pair had a clutch of seven eggs. When laying the fourth
he hen became egg-bound. She had left the nest and sat on the ground.
- took the bird indoors and tried to massage the egg out of the body.
took her in my left hand and with three fingers of the right hand
. pressed the egg out. But there are two points which must be observed
lou must not try to do things too quickly and must watch the bird
md feel or see when the hen herself is straining to get rid of the egg
ind just at that moment you must help her. Then sometimes the egg
nust be moistened, especially when it is visible. Naturally, this way
)f curing is only possible when the bird is in good condition and when
he egg-binding is not caused pathologically. In this way I have
)een successful three times. I suppose that the birds got egg-bound
)ecause the temperature had fallen rapidly. I think, however, that
me can very often prevent it by feeding cod-liver oil. Thus in 1954 my
losellas had twenty-eight eggs and reared only two young.
! 955 was another poor season. When three young of my old pair
lad died I took the remaining two and reared them by hand. They
vere fed on milled sunflower seed, oats, and millet. Some greens and
:arrots were added and the food was moistened and warmed. The
wo youngsters did very well and turned out to be a pair. The male
scaped, when I did not think he was yet able to fly ; but the next
lay he returned and I was able to catch him. He is still in my
&gt;ossession, and when I enter his aviary he takes sunflower seeds from
ny hand and sits on my shoulder. Two other young Rosellas I had
aken out of their nest some weeks later. These birds were fed for
ome time on hulled millet, used for human consumption. Probably
ome vitamins were missing in this food and, though I added greens
nd carrots every day, the plumage developed very badly. They
ould not fly till they were eight months old.
Last year (April, 1956) there were three pairs of Rosellas on eggs
nd I hoped that we would have a good season. But I believe that
his hope is a characteristic feature of every bird-lover all over the

HUMMING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99791311627907" page_id="58073280"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
By Professor J. Berlioz (Paris, France)
(Address given to the British Aviculturists' Club, 13 th March, 1957*)
Among the numerous groups of perching birds, the Humming
Birds, which constitute the family Trochilidae, are, with the Trogons
certainly the best defined and most isolated of all, really showing
no connecting link with any other type. Nothing is known about thei;
ancestors and even their actual affinities remain quite obscure, althougl
they are most generally considered by modern systematicians to b&lt;
more or less closely allied to the Swifts.
The chief characters are as follows :--
Mostly of very diminutive size (the largest like a Swift, the smalles
like a bumble-bee).
Bill, very thin, elongated, tubular, pointed, either straight o
curved downwards or, sometimes, upwards.
Peculiar tongue, long, protractile, bitubular at the end, and attachec
to a curious bony formation encircling the skull, not unlike that of th
Woodpeckers.
Extreme shortness of the wings and legs, more reduced than ii
any other type of birds. The wings always have ten primaries, bu
not more than five or six secondaries. The feet, also very short, alway
have four toes, often with strong claws.
Brilliancy of the plumage, mostly composed of scale-like feathers
the tail always composed of ten rectrices, very seldom less. Th
shiny appearance of the plumage is due to the physical structure c
the feathers, which produces various shades of iridescent colouring
unrivalled by other birds, but always devoid of any pigment excep
black or rufous. Males and females are sometimes alike, but generall
differ in various ways ; however, sometimes they are quite dissimila
in pattern and colouring.
They are very active, often aggressive and pugnacious little bird
fighting among themselves and even attacking much larger an
stronger birds, such as birds of prey and Tyrant-Flycatchers, utilizin
their wonderful power of flight and their very sharp acute bill. The
have but few natural enemies : however, it is said that the smalk
species, when hovering in front of flowers, may be caught and eate
by aerial predators, such as the Bemtevi Tyrant and even fall victin
of the big American spiders.
Humming Birds are strictly confined to America, but here they ai
to be found everywhere where there are flowers. Although muc
more numerous in the tropical parts of America, some of them sprea&lt;
during the northern summer, as far north as Alaska and Labrado
Similarly, in the southern hemisphere, one species at least is to be loui
during the southern summer as far south as the Strait of Magellan.

The reason why the life of the Humming Birds seems so closely
onnected with the existence of flowers is because in flowers they
ind both food and drink. It has long been wrongly believed that their
Dod was essentially composed of the sweet secretions of the flowers ;
&gt;ut it is now well known that animal food is much more necessary
o them and in fact they feed chiefly on very small insects which are
hemselves attracted by the liquids inside the flowers. Humming
lirds are perfectly able, too, to catch the flying insects on the wing,
ising their long protractile tongue for this purpose quite as cleverly
,s in picking them out from the flowers.
Even in some countries where flowers are scarce, as is the case in
he Juan Fernandez Islands, Humming Birds remain almost strictly
nsectivorous. In other very dry parts of the American Pacific Coast,
diere there are only few soft insects, Humming Birds may in some
^ay become more or less frugivorous, feeding mostly on the juice
f damaged cactus fruits, when the latter have been attacked by ants
&gt;r other animals.
Considering the wide variation of food these birds may adopt
ccording to climatic conditions, it is less astonishing to find them so
ddely spread everywhere in America, from the low tropical rain-
orests to the highest mountain ranges or in subdesert areas. Owing
o their perpetual need of food they are particularly numerous in
ultivated areas, where gardens and orchards provide all kinds of
lowers and insects nearly the whole year round. For the same reason,
he Humming Birds which nest in temperate countries are migratory
nd several species every year make very long voyages, starting from
heir breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska and reaching as far
outh as Central America and Panama, where they spend the autumn
nd winter months.
The peculiar structure of the wings affords the Humming Birds
most peculiar and unique mode of flight ; it consists in an un-
aterrupted sequence of very rapid wing-beats, the speed of which
lay attain 50 or more per second for the smaller species. The name
Humming Birds " is actually derived from this flight, which closely
esembles the flight of certain moths and produces similarly charac-
eristic sounds. Another peculiarity of their ability of flight is that they
re the only birds which are able to fly backwards, which they can
0 at the same speed and quite as easily as in any other direction.
&gt;ut, on the other hand, they cannot use their feet for any motion
t all when perching on a branch or sitting on the ground. They
dll be seen remaining nearly motionless on the same twig for several
ainutes, then they will suddenly fly away at an astonishing speed
nd, after acrobatic flights in the air, come back to the same place,
ast as flycatchers do.
Nearly all their food is obtained on the wing, both the small insects

captured in the air and the food sucked from the flowers. The
hover rapidly at the same place in front of the flower and push in th
long bill and protractile tongue to reach the nectar and insects inside
However, on a few occasions, and especially in the case of certaf
mountain species which are more sluggish in their habits, they perc&apos;
close to the flower, taking their food from the latter just as most of th
Passerine nectarivorous birds do.
Nesting habits : there is still much to be learned about their nestin
habits. Until quite recently it has been accepted as a strict rule tha
Humming Birds are polygamous and that both sexes, except for th
short period of mating, live quite independently apart from each othe]
even during migration. Their nests are generally most delicati
though solid, cup-shaped structures, attached to twigs or varioi
other supports, and the building of which is done by the females alont
They almost invariably lay two eggs, the latter being uniformly whit
and comparatively large for the size of the bird. Females also undei
take alone the entire incubation and the rearing of the chicks. Thes
remain about twenty-four days in the nest, until their wings ar
completely grown, as they are unable to move until they acquire th
same ability of flight as the parents.
However, some very recent observations made in Venezuela seei
to prove that, at least in a few cases, the male does not remain quit
so indifferent to the rearing of the young as is generally believei
These observations concern a somewhat large and common species (
Humming Bird, Colibri coruscans. The observer (Dr. E. Schafei
discovered a nest containing one young, newly hatched, and or
egg, to which obviously male and female came alternately both 1
incubate the egg and to feed the young bird (although both sex&apos;
of this species are more or less similar in appearance, the male ha
an abnormal feather pattern which rendered him unmistakable).
It is impossible to ascertain whether the same habits are to be foun
in all individuals of the same species or not. But it may be recalle
that there is a modern theory that among birds in which the tw
sexes are similar in appearance, both parents generally assume tl
same duties in the rearing of the young. And, on the other han&lt;
it is a well-known fact now that in many so-called " polygamous
birds, individual cases of monogamy may exceptionally occur.
Finally some words may be added concerning Humming Birds i
confinement. At least three conditions are necessary for their goc
health and maintenance : space for flying ; insects as their fund,
mental food ; water and moisture for most species.
For more than half a century efforts have been made to kee
these beautiful tiny creatures in confinement. But after many failur
it was not until some thirty years ago that these efforts became real
successful. The long delay involved in bringing them from Ameri&apos;

0 Europe, the need of fresh food every day, the wrong idea that sweet
iquids constituted their normal diet, have been the chief causes of so
nany failures, and, for the few specimens able to reach Europe at
hat time, they generally died suddenly after a few weeks at most.
remember in 1922 visiting one of the first attempts made in Paris
0 maintain a small collection of living Humming Birds in Count de
iegur's aviary. Each bird was kept alone in a special cage, and several
imes every day was given a few minutes of freedom in a very large

In more recent times great improvement has been achieved both
n transportation and in giving the best conditions of life in con-
inement. There is no doubt that when still more has been learned
.bout their life in the wild, it will become still less difficult ; but
t is certainly rather unlikely that they will ever become real " pets "
or their owners.

By J. R. van Oosten (San Marino, California, U.S.A.)
(&apos;Continued from page 50)
During the month of January, 1956, I was very fortunate in beim
able to purchase from Professor Carl Naether a beautiful pair of Black
chinned Yuhinas in excellent condition. I already had one hen whicl
had been imported a few years ago from India. In the same ship
ment I received a Golden-eyed Babbler and the two arrived as gooc
friends and have remained so. It was a funny sight to see the Yuhin;
follow the Babbler, about twice her size, everywhere it wen
Never having seen any of these Babblers I was unable to sex mine
but I am sure that it is a male as it sings all the time. The new pai
of Yuhinas were liberated after four days in a holding cage to allov
the other birds in the aviary to get used to them. My greatest fea
was that the cock might kill the odd hen, but upon being released th&lt;
pair paid no heed to her. Therefore I left her in, a thing which I nov
very much regret.
Sexing these little birds I find fairly easy as there is a difference o
colour on the breast of the hens. The colour throughout is uniforn
in both the male and the female with only that one exception. Thes&lt;
breast feathers are almost a fawn grey, the male's being dark grey
Also I found that the male is somewhat larger than the two hens. Thi
I noticed when I bought the pair, but with the three of them it is quit&lt;
unmistakable. Both sexes have a little song, but the male's last
longer and is uttered more often and is a little deeper in tone. On
of their characteristics is when they are apart they call to each othe
in a short one-note call, which increases if something is found ; where
upon the other one comes at once. They are extremely inquisitiv
and spent the first few weeks exploring all the corners of the " glas
house " and adjoining flight. They also spend a great deal of tim
hawking fruit-flies, and with each fly caught one hears the snaj
which most Flycatchers make. This sound also reminds one of th
snap which Manakins make. One day while visiting Mr. Isenber;
I heard his Black and White Manakin make the same snapping noise
but I believe that Manakins make this noise when not hawkim
insects.
In March the pair was observed inspecting the nest-boxes and finall'
they settled on a small finch nest-box which had a platform in front
The materials they used were string, cotton, pieces of burlap, sma
twigs, dog hair, with a lining of bird feathers, string, and dog hair
Being drafted into the military service at the end of March I wa
unable to keep any notes of what happened during the following tw&lt;
months. Upon my return in June I at once noticed that my Yuhina

iow totalled five instead of three. No doubt the success can be once
igain attributed to the fruit-flies as there was always an ample supply to
le had. I feel strongly that with cultures of these flies, two or three
o an aviary when young are in the nest, plus a few mealworms, and
vhere possible other live food, it would not be impossible to rear many
nore of the baby softbills to maturity. The young were decidedly on
heir own because when they begged their parents for food and none
vas offered they flew to the feeding tray and proceeded to eat by
ihemselves. They ate soaked currants, egg food, apple, grapes, and
frank a little honey-water ; also they were able to hawk flies, so
;hey were definitely not dependent upon their parents.
I had noticed that since my leaving the male had become somewhat
more aggressive and that should have been the sign for me to remove
the three birds. However, as we often do, I left them in there and the
day before I left to go back to the Navy after a fourteen-day leave
[ found three dead Yuhinas on the ground. The old hen was taken
lo the taxidermist as were the two young, but I had all the insides
taken to a lab and as luck would have it the young were a male
and female. There is no doubt the male Yuhina killed the other three
but of this I cannot be sure. These graceful little birds are hard to come
by here in the States and the loss was very saddening. If I should lose
one of the pair, especially the hen, it would be a long time before
I could replace it. However, if the success is repeated next year the
young will be separated as soon as they are able to feed by themselves.
The young resembled the parents except for being lighter in colour
throughout the body and their crests were not yet as black. The bill
did not show the colour of the parents. When adult the lower mandible
has a spot of red at the joint where the bill meets the body, their feet
were also not as full of colour. Beyond this they resembled and
possessed all the funny and comical antics and habits which one
associates with this family.
Some other attempts were made but nothing came of them. 1 his
was the first year that I was able to rear any young ones. Softbills are
very funny in this respect as sometimes they breed and other times they
do not even make an honest effort. One pair of Pagoda Mynahs built
a nest, but no eggs were laid and the nest was finally destroyed. A
pair of Red-eared Bulbuls and a pair of Yellow-winged Bulbuls were
seen carrying nesting materials but nothing came of it. All my White-
eyes--two pairs of Indian, one pair of Australian (obtained from
Mr. Isenberg), and a male Australian which mated with a female
Indian--have never shown the slightest interest in breeding or even
building a nest. Mr. Isenberg each year always rears a few and I believe
this may be due to the large clumps of dwarf bamboo which he has
in their aviary. The clump I have is not thick enough so this could
very possibly be the reason why they have not shown the least interest.

J. R. VAN OOSTEN-ADVENTURES WITH SOFTBILLS
The group of birds which fascinates me the most is the Tan age
family. I find these birds full of antics besides being extremely colourful
I have at the present quite a few of these gems, but in all the time sine
beginning with softbills I have run across very few females. Thes
birds should be easy to breed if one could find the hens. One pai
I obtained a few years ago from Mr. William Krebs were sittin;
on a nest of two eggs, but as he did not want to bother with the youns
he broke up the nest and I took the birds. Both were in excellen
condition, but after seven days the hen succumbed. For what reasoi
I was unable to find out as the death report showed no signs of anything
wrong. The pair were the lovely Golden-headed Tanager. The mal(
passed on about six months ago and I have not been able to fine
another. At the same time I had one Yellow-headed Tanager whicl
looks the exact duplicate of the Golden-headed in body, size, anc
distribution of the colours j the only difference, of course, was tha
they were not the same in colour, the former being gold on top anc
the sides of the head with a metallic green body and black wings
back, and tail. The latter s head is yellow, body a metallic sky-blue
wings, back, and tail black. Another very interesting one is the
Blue-backed Tanager, which closely resembles and is related tc
Desmarest s Tanager. The difference is that the rump and front of the
former is a metallic light royal blue instead of green, and the heac
is bnck-iecl instead of scarlet. The little yellow band which separates
the led ol the head and the green of the back is not very noticeable
in the blue-backed. Also from Mr. Krebs I obtained a female Blue-
crowned Chlorophonia , otherwise known as the Emerald Tanager. I had
for years been worried about these birds, as I lost over ten after each
had been in my collection for no more than two months. I finally
decided to cut down on the banana and orange and that did the trick.
By doing this I forced them to eat more egg food, which before they
only pecked as il there was nothing else left. Now with the hen,
I purchased from a dealer two young males which were coming into
theii adult moult ; both did well and the three were together all the
time. After about two years I found both the males in the pond and
have no idea how they got there. Fortunately I still have the hen and
a male will not be hard to procure. Also I have had pairs of the Violet
Euphonia but was never able to keep them more than a year for the
same leason as the above birds. I also have had females of the Blue,
Copper-headed, Palm, Maroon, Blue-and-Black, Superb, and Pectoral
Euphonia. Three of these I still have left to-day. Last year I was very
lucky in importing eighteen of the beautiful Red-eared Tanagers
from Ecuador. I have eight left after losing two and selling eight.
Mr. Charles Gordier brought thirteen back with him some years ago
and one of these came to the San Diego Zoo. This is where I first saw
the bird and fell in love with it. This year my wish came true and not

nly did I get some of these birds but amongst them were three hens,
f I were an artist I would make a plate for the Magazine, as their
ieauty can only be appreciated if seen in life ; however, a description
/ill have to do. To begin with we will imagine that the bird is jet
dack ; in size it is just a little bit smaller than the Mountain Tanager.
ust behind the eye is a small crescent-shaped spot of scarlet-red,
rom which the bird derives its name ; in the female the shape ol
his crescent is smaller and not as bright. Then from just below the
hest in a straight line across, through the belly and rump is the other
irea of scarlet-red, which again is several shades lighter in the hens,
rhe bird also has a spot of blue at the first wing joint which shows
vhile sitting still, but much better when flying. It is the same metallic
ight royal blue which the Mountain Tanager has on its wing ; also
ipon close inspection it will be noted that this spot of blue in the hen
s not as large as that of the male. They were very nervous when they
irst arrived, but now have settled down and three ol them will take
nealworms from the hand. In the same shipment I received another
Tanager which reminds one in size and shape of an Emerald Tanager
)nly bigger. The colour is a very deep and bright royal blue all over,
vith the front, from the neck to the vent, canary yellow ; the wings
md tail have a greenish sheen to them when the bird is sitting in the
;un. I could find no description in Aviculture , Vol. I, to fit the bird,
50 I am not able to name it. I sold the bird to Mr. Jerome Buteyn
md the last time I saw it it had fully feathered out and looked beautiful.
1 hope in future to have as many of the Tanager family as I can as they
are very interesting and always full of life.
In the same shipment I received five other birds which I can
find no description of in either the back issues of this Magazine
or in Aviculture , Vol. I, or in any of the books which I have seen.
These birds arrived two days before I went back to the Navy and
unfortunately all I have left are the skins. I hope that as soon as I am
back in civilian life I will again be able to procure some more ol these
birds.
The first bird was some type of giant Ant-Thrush or Ant-Pitta
which belongs to the New World. Few of these birds have ever been
imported because of the fact that they are hard to trap as well as hard
to see in the jungle. Mr. Cordier imported some a few years ago,
from, I believe, British Guiana, but these were smaller and, I remembei,
they were called Helmeted Ant-d hrushes. The bird that I had
resembled in body that of a Pitta, only about three-quarters again
as large, with a little longer tail. The head was similar and the beak
was longer and musty black in colour, the feet were a dull flesh colour.
The eye was light brown with a black iris. The head above the eyes,
back, rump, and upper side of the tail was dark grey-blue ; the chin
to the sides of the neck and three-quarters of an inch below the chin

was a light rusty or copper brown. The rest of the bird--chest, belly
vent, and underside of the tail--was the fawn colour of a fawn Zebra
Finch. The chest, belly, and vent were also dotted with black spots
each spot being one-quarter of an inch in diameter and surrounded
by a ring an eighth of an inch wide, of the above-mentioned light
rusty or copper brown. Each dot was roughly half an inch away from
the next. The bird was quite tame, but when food was placed in the
cage it would pounce on it like a dog. It would eat nothing but
canned dog food, mealworms, cut up raw meat, some egg food, and
a few raisins.
The next two birds were the same and in size resembled a Magpie
Tanager, but with a more streamlined body. They looked like a
member of the Tanager family but I could not tell for sure. The beak
and feet were black and the eye was scarlet red with a black iris.
This was the most outstanding feature of the bird. The top of the head
was black with three red feathers which began at the crown and ran
back to the back of the head ; these the bird would raise a half an
inch, along with the black feathers, when it became excited in any
way. The rest of the plumage was a light blue-grey, more blue, which
became almost black on the wings and tail. The birds were not
nervous and they would eat anything put before them. They preferred
soaked currants, egg food, grapes, and milk sop to anything else.
I could not tell if they were young or not, but it seemed that there
should have been a few more red feathers on the head instead of just
the three. I should mention here that all five of these birds arrived in
perfect condition without so much as a spoiled feather.
1 he last two were members of the Cotinga family, a cock and a hen.
These birds are very rare and not easy to come by, not even in the
jungle. I his was my saddest loss, for there will be one chance in a
hundred to replace them. The hen was an evergreen green with
yellow feathers dotted over the lower chest and belly, and her beak
and feet were a yellowish colour. In size she was a little larger than
a Mountain Tanager. About six months before I had seen the same
bird in a shipment which Mr. Ray Thomas received from Colombia
and which now is in Mr. Jean Delacour's collection in Los Angeles.
Upon looking through an old issue of the American Aviculture magazine
I saw a coloured picture of a pair of Swallow Tanagers and the hen
looked exactly like the two birds in every way. However, while visiting
Mr. Delacour one day, and seeing the bird, I was informed that
it was a hen Cotinga of some sort. The bird was in beautiful shape and
seemed to be quite happy in its new surroundings. With this in mind
the next bird which I shall describe could very well have been the male
of the species, for it had all the characteristics of the Cotinga family.
The size and shape of the body was very similar to that of a Naked-
throated Bell Bird, though it was not so large. The beak and feet were

orange, like that of the bill of a Toucan, and the e.ye was orangeish
with the black iris and a black eye cere. The whole head and neck
were jet black, the back, wings, and upper side of the tail were a dark
evergreen green, while the chest, belly, vent, rump, and under side
of the tail a green colour like the breast of a Blue-throated Barbet,
only a shade lighter. The belly, lower half of the chest, and vent
were dotted with black dots which were surrounded by a very small
ring of white. The dots were about half an inch apart and about three-
eighths of an inch in diameter. The ring was roughly a sixteenth of
an inch wide. Both birds were very quiet and were not easily disturbed
upon someone entering the room ; they only moved to eat, drink,
bathe, and preen themselves. They would take only egg food made
into small balls, a few mealworms, small pieces of cut-up apple, pear,
banana, and tomato, and catoniaster berries and grapes, which they
liked the best.
Another shipment came to me in November, 1955, which contained
three of the very rare and beautiful Apricot Cocks-of-the-Rock. These
birds are larger than the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock, of which I have a
male, but look the same in all respects except that the scarlet is replaced
by a deep orange. Upon arrival two birds did not look to be in good
shape. I stayed up two nights following, hand-feeding them, but on the
third day one was lost. A week later one was sold after it looked
to be in good condition, but it died within two weeks. The death
report on both these birds showed that they had a disease in the
intestinal tract which they had had for some time. The last one
was liberated after two weeks in the " glass house ", after the Scarlet
had been transferred to the " medium size " aviary, and lived for
another six weeks before it died. The bird was in perfect condition
and seemed to be fine and healthy. As I was away at college I fear
that the bird was not fed correctly, which caused its death. The
death report stated that the lack of food had been the cause, and so,
had the bird been fed correctly, it would have lived.
I have found that importing birds is not as expensive as one might
think. I have also found that by shipping the birds in reinforced
aluminium transport cages one cuts the air freight cost by half;
this is where most of the money goes when importing birds. I also
have the transport cages made collapsible so that I can send them back
to the collector for the next shipment. Being able to import, one is
able to get some of the rarer birds plus the ones you can buy from
your dealer. Of course you are going to have losses, but if the food
and water vessels are hung properly and enough food is provided and
fixed so that it cannot spill on the bottom of the cage, you will eliminate
another cause of death. In this way I have cut my losses down fifty
per cent of what they used to be. I would also like to add that I have
imported the greater part of my collection as it would have been almost

impossible for me to purchase them here in the States. On the whole
the members in England and Europe can obtain foreign softbills
more easily than we can here in the States. No doubt the reason is
that more people are interested in softbills over there than here,
but I, like others, hope that some day people here will take more
of a lancy to them. One reason for this lack of interest may be that
it is imagined the cost of feeding this type of bird is an expensive
affair, but I think that the following might change some minds.
Much has been written by various members of the Society on the
feeding of softbills and therefore I would also like to throw my hat in
the ring. There are many ways of feeding and each person has his
or her own idea on what is the best. I have tried to feed my birds
in such a manner as to keep them in excellent condition and yet not
spend a fortune on them. At present the birds are being fed by our
German cook and I must say she does a better job than I do. As
has already been pointed out the only live food which is given are the
fruit-flies, but during the winter months this is supplemented with
mealworms. Also there are other insects which are available to them
in the green moss around the waterfall, off plants, and from the
ground. I might add that freshly cut grass is always given to them
and they seem to enjoy poring over it in search of all sorts of things.
The mainstay of their feeding is a ready prepared Mockingbird
food which I buy from a dealer. This is made of one-half Spratt's
Mockingbird food and one-half finely ground enriched dog meal ;
to this is added equal amounts of cod liver oil and wheat germ oil
to make it still fairly dry, but so that each ground is well soaked in
oil. Then ten pounds of dried flies are added to a hundred pounds
of mixture. To this I myself add one box of pablum and one of wheat
germ cereal to each ten pounds. This dries it up a bit more and adds
a few more desirable ingredients. This is fed to all the birds and is
also relished by doves, quail, cardinals, and Rainbow Buntings.
The next main item which I have found to be very good, and probably
most lesponsible for keeping my birds in good health and excellent
condition, is the egg food formula mixture which I have worked out.
It consists of the following :--

Dr a week if kept in the ice box. My birds prefer this mixture to any-
hing else I feed and nothing much else is touched until it is all gone,
feed it in very generous amounts to all my birds. The last two items,
olour food and sea kelp, which contains iodine, are, I think, responsible
or keeping the reds, yellows, and oranges from fading during the
noult. This was especially noted in the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock,
or after four moults his colour was the same as the day I got him.
Then, while away, my father ran out of both the above and the bird
noulted twice before I could obtain any more. Now that it is back
&gt;n the mixture the bird seems to be regaining some of the scarlet and is
edder now than he was last year at this time. The same thing held
rue for a male Red-rumped Tanager which never lost any of the brilliant
ed colour of his rump after five years in my collection.
Along with the two above items the following things are also fed.
V jar of peanut butter, two jars each in the two larger aviaries, is kept
n front of them at all times, also a bowl of sunflower seed and raw
jeanuts mixed together. Soaked currants and soaked raisins, for
he larger birds, are given fresh daily, as is fruit. The small birds receive
resh honey-water daily and three times a week five drops of Zyma-
Irops and ABCD drops are added. This gives the birds much of the
dtamins and minerals which they do not get otherwise. Twice a week
:anned dog food, a brand with no gravy, is given to all the birds,
vlilk sop is fed once a week during the hot months and twice a week
luring the colder months of the year. It is made in the following

This is then heated until thoroughly mixed, and cooled before being
ed. Every other week they receive a bowl of cottage cheese, of which
hey are extremely fond. Occasionally they are also given cooked peas
ind diced beet and carrots.
During the various seasons of the year many wild berries are to be
tad and a bowl is always kept full in all the aviaries. The rest of their
eeding consists of fruit. Being fortunate in having a little acreage
md a good climate we are able to grow some fruit trees which produce
enough for home consumption as well as for the birds. We have
ig, avacado, persimmon, apricot, orange, plum, peach, and nectarine
rees on the place. Apple, banana, and tomato is purchased the year

mentioned above when in season. This costs us seventy-five cents s
week. This fruit is not saleable to the public because it is somewhat
damaged but for the birds it is perfect and I have never lost one bird
because of bad fruit. The fruit is kept in a separate ice box in the
garage and stays perfectly good for a week.
This then is the extent of what I feed my birds. I have a little ovei
200 softbills and the cost of feeding them ranges from ten to fourteer
dollars a month, which I feel is very cheap.
I hope that this article will be of interest to the members and thai
more will write on the adventures of their birds. The keeping of bird;
is a greatly expanding hobby and pastime and the more interest the
more we can learn. As for myself, as each day passes I find out some-
thing new in the habits of the birds or how better I may take can
of them. It is up to each member to support the Magazine, for I an
sure that each one of us has learned much by reading its pages.

By R. E. B. Brown (Newcastle, N.S.W., Australia)
At the end of the war an absolute ban was imposed by the Veterinary
Authority on the importation of all birds into Australia, for fear of th(
introduction of Fowl Pest, or Newcastle Disease. This is said to bt
widespread in the world, but has never occurred in Australia. Th(
ban, coming when it did, at the end of the war, found our aviarie:
much depleted with regard to foreign birds as, of course, none hac
been imported during the war. Although I am of the opinion tha
Australian birds are second to none, both in beauty and interest, it i:
sad to be cut off from many old friends among the foreigners.
At the time I had three red Tanagers, a pair of Scarlet (Brazilian)
and a hen Maroon, so I thought I would try to breed a domestic race
of these birds. In this I have had some success. I have now brec
them to seven generations, and have four main kinds, pure Scarlet
obvious hybrids, Maroon with a dash of Scarlet, and Scarlet with #
dash of Maroon. I have others showing various degrees of mixec
blood. The hybrids are very beautiful birds.
I first paired the Scarlets together, and next summer mated theii
son to the hen Maroon. A point of interest is that I successfully
mated him before he came into colour ; he had white patches on hi
beak, but was quite brown. The hybrids are fully fertile, and Maroor
is dominant over Scarlet. The Tanagers are all perfectly tame witl
people they know, but it is surprising how they can distinguisl
strangers.

These birds are kept in open garden aviaries with natural trees
owing in them, and no other shelter is necessary in this climate ;
have never been able to persuade them to go to nest in anything but
living natural tree. They will live in small aviaries, but will not
eed, and they do not look well in them, and tend to lose their
ight red colour. The smallest aviary I have ever successfully bred
em in is 18 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, with a privet tree
one end and a shelter at the other. But they do much better in
rger aviaries ; the larger the better. My largest is 25 feet long,
; feet wide, and 12 feet high. When breeding only one pair of
anagers can be kept in an aviary, but they do not interfere with
her birds.
My birds are fed on softbill mixture to which freshly grated hard-
hied egg is added to the daily ration. Fruit is, of course, essential,
id I always provide banana, apple, pear, and orange, and paw-paw,
apes, and mangoes, etc., in season. In a country where fruit is hard
get, banana and one other fruit would be enough, but the birds
ould always have green food, grit, and crushed egg shells. They
ould also have insects daily. They like white ants themselves, but
ill not feed the young on them.
I think I should describe the breeding of these closely related
&gt;ecies together, merely mentioning the differences. They both
lild cup-shaped nests of grass, small twigs, teased rope, and cotton
ool. They often place broad leaves on the bottom of the nest. The
:arlet builds a very strong nest, the Maroon a much weaker one.
get over this by giving the hen Maroon some cotton wool, noting
here she puts this, and placing a wire gauze shape at the exact spot
here she wants to build. Nearly all hens will go ahead and build
1 the wire shape.
The eggs of both species are blue with reddish-brown spots, the
laroon eggs being smaller ; the Scarlet often lays three eggs, the
laroon never more than two. Incubation for both is twelve days,
&apos;hilst the young are in the nest live food only is given, and most of
te feeding is done by the hen. The young are coloured like the hens,
hey always leave the nest on the twelfth day ; they cannot fly well
this stage, but are able to hop about in the trees. As soon as they
ave the nest the parents start giving them banana and soft food
i well as the live food.
The live food given should be varied as much as possible, the
irents will not give the young white ants at all, but demand larger
sects. I have on one occasion reared a nest of Scarlets on mealworms
one, but much better specimens are reared if a variety is given.
3 me hens flatly refuse to feed two days running on the same insects,
at simply demand a variety. My old Maroon hen, now 19 years of
and still breeding, does this. I use mealworms, casemoth grubs,

BREEDING THE SUPERB PARROT IN
CALIFORNIA

The breeding of three young Superb Parrots in 1955 and three age
in 1956 in California has been something of an avicultural triump
Doubtless members in Europe will not feel this is a very accurate a:
warranted statement, but it is now some fifteen years since this beautii
species has been bred in the United States.
Probably I ought to say that the term " Superb " is not vu
frequently used in describing Polytelis swainsonii and Barraband's is t:
more commonly used name. But I have always felt that the appellatii
" Superb " is wonderfully accurate for this species. The beauty]
plumage and elegant shape, accompanied by its winning ways, ma:
it a favourite.
The only other recorded breeding of the Barraband's or Supc
Parrakeet in the United States is the record by Mr. I. D. Putnam, i
San Diego about 1940. The late Mr. Putnam told me that three you;
were reared from this breeding. One young from this breeding wan
tame male which Mr. Putnam kept for a pet ; later it passed into T
hands of Mrs. Hubbell, of San Diego, and was the father of the you;
hybrid Barraband's X Rock Pebblers she raised a few years ago.
It is odd that this species has proved to be so difficult to breed he
in America. They are easily kept in good health and always appear]
be happy and contented, but somehow they just don't nest. Howev\
hybrids between male Superbs and female Crimson-wings were rearl
on several occasions by the late Dr. Ralph Woods and they wu
exceptionally beautiful birds. These hybrids all appeared to have bet
sterile when mated back to parents or inter se.
My own pair did not nest in 1952, 1953, or 1954. In each of the
years the pair were obviously in breeding condition and matings a1
feedings were observed, but they never settled down to an aetd
nesting.
During 1955 and 1956 the male came into breeding condition sligh

lead of the hen. Male Superbs display spasmodically throughout the
?ar and their display is not unamusing. Beginning in March, the male
*gan calling and displaying to a rather bored and uninterested female,
his process continued and late in March the female became more
'ceptive and interested. Very suddenly, in April, the female allowed
le male to feed her very frequently and invited pairing. Even so, she
id not visited either nest-box and did not seem to approve of either
te grandfather-clock nest or the smaller box. In late April, following
period of about ten days where pairings took place several times a day,
Le female entered the smaller of the two boxes provided and began
*sting. Incubation apparently began with the first egg and from that
me until the young were about two weeks old the hen was observed
lly twice. She was a perfect prospective mother and did not leave
le nest when I entered the aviary to replace food, etc.
During the incubation period the male would visit the nest-box and
ed her. At this time the squeaking sound the hen would make when
le was being fed by the male could be heard. The nest-box chosen
as about 18 inches wide, 18 inches deep, and 18 inches tall--and so
was sufficiently roomy to permit the male to enter and easily feed
Le hen without the danger of scattering or breaking the eggs.
The sound of young being fed was heard on the twenty-second day
ter incubation started. From about the third day following this the
ale began to enter the nest and to (apparently) feed the young as
ell as the hen. As Superbs are good-sized birds the male was observed
&gt;ending an unusual amount of time eating to provide the necessary
od for the family. Fruit, as apple and orange were appreciated, and
ssh corn on the cob was also devoured. Greens, as poa annua or
ass clippings, and the berries of the pyracantha were also given.
iaked bread was given in the morning and again in the evening and
ed was scattered on the aviary floor where the earth's dampness
.used some of it to sprout.
The aviary the parents occupied was 17 feet long, 3 feet wide, and
leet tall. A shelter at one end was provided for inclement weather--
hich we do have in California ! The nest-box was hung at the edge
the shelter and faced north. Rough wood chips were used as nesting
aterial. A large stick was placed just below the entrance to the
:sting-box and the male seemed to enjoy sitting on this perch and
Iking to his mate inside the nest every now and then. He would
casionally fly to the box, look inside, and then fly away--satisfied
at all was well.
The youngsters prospered and the mother bird brooded them very
\0x25A1sely for the first two weeks. An observation of the nest revealed
at three of the four eggs had hatched and that the young were
-veloping nicely. About the end of the third week a second look
vealed that either the mother or the father were picking the feathers

on the back of the babies. Since the guilty parent was unknown anc
the picking was not dangerous nothing was done other than to keej
hoping !
About the end of the fifth week the first two youngsters came out o
the nest. They were strong on the wing and quite steady, but lookec
very unattractive because their backs were all feather-picked. Tht
third youngster left the nest three days later and from the very minut(
she left the nest the mother began to pick her back so severely that th(
youngster would bleed. Neither parent would try to feed the thirc
youngster once she had left the nest (for it was a young hen) and so thi
baby was taken to a friend who very kindly offered to hand-feed it fo:
a few days until it was on its own.
Eventually all three of the young Barraband's or Superbs wen
placed together in an aviary where they have done very well. At thi
time (November) they appear to be two cocks and one hen--thougl
no definite red feathers have come in on the youngsters thought to b&lt;
cocks. The feathers on the back have grown in and one could not, a
this time, tell that they had ever been picked.
I should like to add that Mr. G. Rayson Brown was also successfu
with this species during 1955 and 1956, rearing four youngsters ir
I 955 at a bout the same time my breeding took place and thre(
youngsters in 1956.
If anyone could throw any light on the reason why the female picket
the youngsters I should appreciate the information so that a recurrenci
could be avoided. From past experiences with this type of thing I hav&lt;
had females pick their youngsters one year and then skip two or thret
years. It certainly is an interesting problem and probably not too akii
to the same problem in Budgerigars, because these larger birds do no
over-nest (would that some of them would !).
It is interesting to note that the Barraband's in my collection an(
also Mr. Brown's have been old enough to nest for several years, bu
not until this year did they attempt to do so. Now one can only hop*
that other reluctant species will follow their lead.

By Erica Eisner (Oxford, England)
The Bengalese is well known as one of the hardiest and easiest to
reed of the weaver-finches ( Estrildinae ) commonly kept in captivity.
; is now also showing itself to be an excellent animal for laboratory
udy. The most frequent type is a piebald of brown (' chocolate ')
id white, and fawn and white birds are also common. Pure white
irds have been bred for a long time, but it seems to be more recently
nly that ' self-coloured ' browns and fawns have been noted,
idging by advertisements and the statement in a recent book
^isdon, 1953) that " I have never seen or heard of a self-coloured
locolate or self-coloured fawn ", these seem to be not yet well known.
The classification into piebalds and self-coloureds is in fact quite
&quot;bitrary, for there is an unbroken gradation from birds with no
hite feathers through piebalds of different degree to birds with no
doured feathers. The ancestral bird was surely not a piebald or a
ure white, but a self-coloured bird ; this is not only obvious of
self, but there is evidence for it. Taka-Tsukasa (1922) quotes a
escription of the original Japanese stock, which apparently had no
lain white feathers.
Wild birds with an odd few white feathers are not rare, but it
ould seem that natural selection keeps this tendency towards piedness
ippressed, so that the normal type is maintained. A reasonable
&lt;planation for this is that birds showing clear patches of white
others are more conspicuous than normals, and therefore more
kely to be killed by predators. In captivity, a bird which had white
athers would not only not be eliminated, but would probably be
lerished as a rarity and used for selective breeding. According to
&apos;aka-Tsukasa, the white Java Sparrow was produced in Japan from
rey birds with white feathers in their wings. It seems most probable
lat the Bengalese was developed similarly.
The genetics of variation in the amount of white shown has not
een worked out in the Bengalese, and as it undoubtedly depends
pon a multiplicity of genes it would probably be extremely difficult
) do so. Such is certainly the case in the mouse. Although that
nimal has been the subject of a vast amount of genetical work, it is
nly in recent years that much progress has been made in the analysis
f ' spotting ', i.e. of the variation in the distribution of white areas,
ike that of all products of long-continued selective breeding, as
hiineberg (1952, p, 65) says, the genetics of spotting in the mouse
i very complex. There is little reason to hope that the Bengalese
rovides an exception. On the average, the offspring of any pair of
lese birds tend to be intermediate in piedness between their parents,

but exceptions to this rule are frequent. I have no experience of pure
white birds, but self-coloureds can be obtained by careful selection
from pairings of birds having few white feathers.
In contrast to the complex problem of the genetics of piedness,
that of the alternative colours is simple. When a bird has coloured
feathers they are either brown or fawn, and these colours are mutually
exclusive. Indeed, it is not only the plumage which shows this, for
fawn-feathered birds have fawn pigment on beak and legs, and newly
hatched chicks which will later grow fawn feathers have fawn coloured
mouth markings and eye-balls, while future browns have the mouth
markings and eye-balls dark. Incidentally, the mouth markings
reflect also, though not so reliably, the future degree of piedness :
self-coloureds have the complete horseshoe pattern characteristic oi
the Mannikin group of the Estrildines, but future piebalds have it
disrupted to a degree correlating roughly with the disruption of the
plumage pattern they will later show.
It is altogether evident that the genetic character of * fawn 5 is a
simple Mendelian recessive to that of ' brown '. Two fawn birds
mated together will invariably produce fawn offspring, and no browns.
Two brown birds which are known to have had no fawn birds in
their ancestry will likewise be true breeding, but brown birds can
carry the factor for fawn without its being evident except from the
results of breeding tests. A pure brown mated to a fawn will produce
only brown offspring. If these are then mated to each other, approxi-
mately one quarter of this second generation will be fawn ; if they
are mated to fawn birds about one-half of the offspring will be fawn.
If a pair of brown birds breed occasional fawn young, then they must
both carry the factor for fawn ; if only one of a pair of brown birds
has the fawn factor then that pair will never produce fawn offspring.
Again, it is most probable that some wild birds do carry such recessive
colour factors, but the chances are against their mating with another
bird which also carries it. If this were to happen, the unusual offspring
would probably have a smaller chance of survival than the normal type.
In captivity, however, such recessive characters rapidly become more
common by inbreeding and selection.
My aim in the foregoing genetical discussion has been to clear the
ground for a discussion of the ancestry of the Bengalese, which has
so far constituted a very vexed question. Some accounts (e.g. Risdon,
1953) say that the breed originated in Japan, but more cautious
authorities say only that it has been bred for many years in Japan, or is
often bred in Japan (e.g. Neunzig, 1921). Taka-Tsukasa (1922) gives
the most informative account of the history of the Bengalese. He says
that according to an old Japanese book on cage birds, the original
stock was imported from China " about 200 years ago ". He does not
say whether these were wild birds or an already domesticated stock.

it gives a description of the original species and says that the white
id fawn varieties appeared considerably later. It may therefore be
id that the Bengalese breed as we know it to-day originated in
pan, but from non-Japanese ancestors. The latter part of this
itement is necessary also because no possible ancestral species occurs
ild in Japan.
What, then, was this ancestral stock ? It is quite obvious, and
nerally recognized, that the Bengalese resembles the Striated and
larp-tailed Finches more than it does any other. However, it is
iwadays quite generally, at least in this country, supposed to be
me kind of hybrid of these types and possibly also the Silverbill ;
) evidence is ever given for this view.
Probably, the present acceptance of this hybrid theory stems from the
eference of Dr. Butler (1894) for it. In the first two decades of this
ntury, though, this view was frequently contested, and even Butler
mself (1907) decided against a hybrid origin. The Bengalese was
en usually thought to be a domesticated strain of the Sharp-tailed
nch. For instance, the reviewer writing on p. 112 of the Avicultural
[agazine for 1902--3 says : " Domestication is also responsible for . . .
id white and pied forms (Bengalese) of the Sharp-tailed Finch. We
Meetly agree . . . that there is no reason for supposing the latter
rds to be hybrids." Recently, Steinbacher and Wolters (1956) have
ritten that it is certainly wrong to suppose that the Silverbill (p. 119)
an ancestor of the Bengalese which they think is most probably
domesticated Sharptail (p. 142), but they do not discuss the matter,
hope to give convincing evidence that this is the correct view.
Possibly the Silverbill was suggested as a part ancestor in order to
:plain the occurrence of fawn individuals, for the Silverbill is fawn
tough of rather a different shade. The knowledge that fawn colour
a mutant inherited in a perfectly normal way makes such an explana-
\0x25A1n altogether unnecessary, and there is no evidence supporting it.
ideed, if their statement is well established, Steinbacher and Wolters
ve the strongest possible evidence against the view that the Silverbill
an ancestor of the Bengalese. They state (p. 152) that although the
engalese produces fertile hybrids with some Mannikins, hybrids
etween the Bengalese and the Silverbill are sterile. However, especi-
i\y as elsewhere (p. 119) they suggest that a hybrid between the
harptail and the Silverbill can be fertile, this point should be checked.
The Striated and Sharp-tailed Finches are considered to be members
r the same species, Lonchura striata. (I use the generic name Lonchura

detailed account of the species is given by Stuart Baker (1926). There
are two sub-specific groups which are distinguished on various grounds,
the most obvious of which is the occurrence of ' lace markings ' or
squamations on the belly and rump feathers. The one group, native
to Ceylon and India, forms the Striated Finches ; the other, distri-
buted from Nepal and Bengal to Malaya and China, consists of the
Sharp-tailed Finches. My descriptions are based not only on those
given by Stuart Baker and others, but also on my own examination
of the collected skins in the British Museum of Natural History.
In all birds of the species the head, breast, back, wings, and tail are
brown, while the belly and rump are lighter. In the Striated Finches
the brown is very dark, tending to be almost black on the head and
breast ; the belly and rump are almost white and contrast markedly
with the dark regions, especially as they show no squamations. The
tail is not especially pointed, and is rather shorter relative to body
size than in the Sharp-tailed Finches. The Sharptails have much
less contrast between the dark and the light regions than do the
Striated Finches. The brown tends to be of less deep a colour, and of
a rather more reddish shade (this is not altogether clear in Stuart
Baker's description, but is stated clearly by Vaurie (1949) and I have
confirmed it). The appearance is further lightened because the
central shafts of the brown feathers are much more conspicuously
pale than in the Striated Finches, and because the edges of the breast
feathers are outlined in a lighter shade. This last character is not
shown by the Indian and Andaman Striated Finches but is shown by
the Nicobar race. This race does, however, agree in all the other
distinguishing characters, and also its limited distribution makes it
unlikely to be relevant to this argument. The ground colour of the
belly and rump is slightly darker in the Sharptails than in the Striated
Finch ; specimens from different regions show squamations to a
varying extent, and where these markings are prominent they give a
grey effect. The tail, as the name implies, is very sharply pointed :
each feather individually is pointed and there is a marked gradation
in length towards the central, longest, feather.
How, then, does the Bengalese compare with these wild birds ?
The easiest comparison to make is between them and a self-coloured
brown Bengalese, and it is immediately obvious that this is quite
different from a Striated Finch, as from all other species, but resembles
some Sharp-tailed Finches greatly. The brown colour is not as dark
as that of the Striated Finches, but has the same tone as that of the
Sharptails ; the belly and rump do not contrast strongly, and bear
squamations. The tail is beautifully pointed. The shafts are prominent
on the brown feathers, and the breast feathers have light edges.
All these characters can also be seen on the brown and white piebalds,
though of course there is no such striking general impression ot

;imilarity. As long as one remembers that the white feathers of the
\0x25A1iebald are superimposed upon the characteristic species plumage
pattern, it is obvious from examination of the feathers that the
Bengalese is a tame Sharp-tailed Finch, and does not have the charac-
teristics of a Striated Finch or any other species.
Unfortunately I have not been able to compare the Bengalese with
living Sharp-tailed Finches, as these are not freely on the market.
Dr. Desmond Morris (unpublished) has compared the behaviour of
the Bengalese with that of the Striated Finch, and with other species
af Mannikin, in detail. He found that the behaviour patterns of the
Bengalese were essentially the same as those of the Striated Finch,
while differing from those of the other species. It is especially note-
worthy that the Bengalese has no behaviour components characteristic
of the Silverbill, whose behaviour is very clearly distinct from that of
the Striated Finch. It is a pity that we do not know how far, if at all,
the behaviour of the Sharp-tailed Finch differs from that of the
Striated Finch ; one would expect that any difference which may
exist would be very slight. Mr. William Bain, vice-chairman of the
National Bengalese Fanciers' Association, wrote to me that " the
Sharp-tailed Mannikin closely resembles the Bengalese in shape, size
and mannerisms
I think there can be little doubt that the Bengalese is a domesticated
form of a Sharp-tailed Finch, i.e. that it is a member of the aculicauda
subgroup of Lonchura striata. This view has frequently been expressed
in the past, and I believe the evidence necessitates its acceptance in
place of the theory of hybrid origin. It is less easy to say from where
exactly the ancestral stock must have come. The most comprehensive
account of the L. s. acuticauda group, that of Stuart Baker (1926), is
rather unsatisfactory. This account recognizes three subspecies :
L. s. acuticauda itself from Nepal and Bengal, L. s. subsquamicollis from
Burma, Indo-China, Malaya and Sumatra, and L. s. squamicollis
from China. The distinction depends largely on two characters :
the nature of the light edges to the breast feathers, and the strength
of the markings on the belly feathers. However, as so often happens,
the natural populations do not fall clearly into separate groups, but
instead there seems to be a continuous change between one area and
another ; such continuous change can never be shown by the usual
type of classification.
The majority of the British Museum specimens from the Indian
end of the range are admittedly like Baker's L. s. acuticauda , which is
described as having breast feathers with rufous edges and only faint
squamations. Similarly, birds from peninsular Siam and Malaya
have strong squamations and conspicuous pale edges to the breast
feathers, in accordance with the description of L. s. subsquamicollis.
But birds from areas in between, such as Burma, are quite clearly

intermediate. leakers description becomes much more seriously
inadequate for birds from regions eastwards of Indo-China, for it
does not suggest that there is a comparable trend of change across
China. The description of L. s. squamicollis applies well to birds from
the West China province of Szechuan. These have very heavily
marked belly feathers and very clearly defined broad pale edges to
the bi east feathers, which are of a yet lighter brown than those of the
otliei sub-species. This characteristic type of breast feather is shown
by all specimens from China but birds from the east coast provinces,
especially f ukien in the south-east, again have less strong squamations.
.The belly feathers ol these birds are comparable to those of specimens
hom lower Burma, but their brown feathers are distinctive in being
consideiably paler. Birds from Formosa have even less clear squama-
tions, and also their brown feathers are of a slightly richer tone than
that of the Chinese mainland birds ; this has previously been pointed
out by La louche (1925)5 ar *d Oberholser (1926) has even created
a subspecies for the Formosan type of Sharptail. The Formosan
specimens are in fact extremely similar to birds from Nepal, the only
1 easonably apparent difference being in their having slightly more
conspicuous pale edges on the breast feathers.

The Bengalese clearly does not resemble the birds from the central
art of the Sharp-tailed Finch's range, for it never has such strong
[uamations. The common name of ' Bengalese Finch ' might be
msidered as circumstantial evidence of origin from the Bengal area,
ut this would be extremely unreliable. The name c Bengali ' w r as
riginally applied to the Cordon-bleu from Africa and may have
een a corruption of Benguela. It was later used indiscriminately
i the bird trade for many of the weaver-finches, and was then
istricted to the Pied Mannikin as a result of Dr. Butler's influence
?low r er, 1906). It would be interesting to know what the Japanese
ernacular name for this bird signifies. It seems much more likely
lat the ancestral stock came from South-East China and/or Formosa.
aka-Tsukasa says that the original Japanese stock came from China
nd that the feathers of the abdomen were " white with pale, dusky
reaks Amongst my own stock of Bengalese, comprising over a
undred birds, the intensity of these streaks is rather variable, but
&gt;ems to be usually less strong than that of the Fukien specimens
hile stronger than that of specimens from Formosa, to which that
rovince is nearest. Specimens from other parts of China, whether
om the Shanghai region further north along the coast or westwards,
11 have too strong markings. As the breast feathers of the Bengalese
re clearly of the Chinese type, with conspicuous pale edges and of a
ather pale brown, I think it must be concluded that the ancestors of
ae Bengalese most probably came from this South-East China region.
In summary, the Bengalese is a domesticated form of Sharp-tailed
inch which was developed in Japan from stock probably originating
1 South-East China or Formosa. There is no reason whatsoever to
appose that it is a hybrid of the Sharp-tailed Finch with any other
*ird.

A White-necked Picathartes has been received from Sierra Leone
as a present from Mr. J. I. Menzies who hand-reared the bird from a
nestling. He fed it on small frogs, lizards, mealworms, grasshoppers,
insectile food, and minced lean meat. It is now living with the one
collected by the first " Zoo Quest " in 1954, and is, of course, only the
second living specimen to be brought from Africa. Like the first
specimen, this young bird has several filoplumes on the top of the other-
wise bald head. The Grey-necked Picathartes brought by Mr. Webb
from British Cameroon during 1948 continues to thrive.
Other gifts are a Citril Finch from Mr. W. Schenck, two White-
throated and one Red-throated Humming Birds from Mr. Randau,
an Indian Broad-billed Roller and a Loo Choo, or Lidth's Jay from
Messrs. Brooke Bond and Go., a Fohkien Grey-headed Crow-Tit from
Mr. G. H. Newmark and a small number of various insectivorous
Indian birds, of which a Black-naped Oriole is the most noteworthy,
from Mr. C. E. Engledew.
A fine Masai Ostrich has been received in exchange from the
Bristol Zoo and a Pileated Kingfisher has been deposited.
The Cormorant hatched on about the 20th of February is now fully
grown and flying. A second nest has been built and probably contains
eggs. A Gannet's egg is being incubated in the same aviary.
Three Black-footed Penguins, five blue-bred green Masked Lovebirds,
and two Gockatiels have been bred. Four Swinhoe's Pheasant chicks
have been hatched and are being reared by the parents which success-
fully reared two last year. It is a pity that this handsome pheasant is

As the author states in the preface, this is not intended as a text-
&gt;ook of Australian birds, but its purpose is to present a factual, gossipy
ccount of the " Believe-it-or-not " features of Australia's remarkable
*ird life. The book is divided into two sections--Biographical and
General--and in the first part all the outstanding groups of Australian
&gt;irds have been dealt with. Aviculturists will find much of interest
oncerning the habits in the wild of the birds they have known only
a captivity, and many will wish that the chapter " The Land of
'arrots " had been longer. Though admittedly a popular book, it
ontains a wealth of information, and many problems are explained

This small handbook contains descriptions and illustrations of ju;
over a hundred of the 650 or more birds native to Australia. As th
author states in his introduction, the book is designed to help peopj
in the more closely settled parts of Australia to recognize birds the
may see at home in the garden or during a day's outing. In eac

Song of Violet-eared Waxbill
I feel I owe an apology to the charming little Violet-eared Waxbill for saying ;
my book, Foreign Bird Keeping, that it has nothing much in the way of a song. Whe
I wrote this I had not kept the species since before the war, and I still cannot rememb:

that the male of a pair in breeding condition we then had was much of a songster-1:
but it is a long time ago ; I should say about 1935.
Now, however, we have a pair that have just gone to nest, and the exquisite beaui'
of the cock is quite matched by the beauty of his song.
When one thinks of small foreign seed-eating songsters one's thoughts natural s
turn to members of the Serin family and chiefly perhaps to the well-known Gree&apos;i
and Grey Singing Finches--both delightful songsters--particularly the latter.
Waxbills, on the other hand, are not remarkable for their song, so it is all jtll
more unexpected that the Violet-eared should have such a fine one. Its song, thougc
perhaps rather more varied, is remarkably like that of the Skylark, and if it had til
same astonishing volume in relation to the bird's size as is the case with the Gre
Singing Finch, I have little doubt that it would be acknowledged as one of the finei,:
songsters of all the small seed-eaters.

During 3rd-gth September, 1956, eleven healthy Ostriches were
Ltched at the Basel Zoo after an incubation period of 47-53 days.
ie clutch of sixteen eggs was incubated by the parent birds them-
slves. Seven eggs were placed in an incubator after 38, and the
imaining eggs after 48, days of incubation, because of the cold and
iny weather. Four eggs did not hatch. They proved to be infertile or
1 ntained dead embryos. One Ostrich hatched under the parents was
!und dead in the nest. The newly hatched chicks were placed in a
odified poultry house which serves mainly for raising birds. It has
wooden floor, big windows to the south, and access to a lawn. The
)or was covered with sand and the room was heated by infra-red
mps to a temperature of 25*~30* C. At the beginning the tempera-
re was never allowed to fall below 20 C. The little birds soon
emed to find places under the lamps where they felt comfortable,
key were left without food for about two days, then dishes were put
Fore them containing chopped fresh alfalfa, carrots, leaves of
indelion and, at times, lettuce. In addition, they were given a
dieted all-mash mixture designed for pullets, containing about
\[ per cent of crude protein, Spratt's Weetmeet, some hard-boiled egg,
id crushed Ostrich-eggshell. From the beginning the green stuff,
pecially alfalfa, was much liked but the pellets, too, were accepted
increasing quantities and we feel that we owe much of our success
this well-balanced diet. Water was offered about twice daily and the
rds took to it most of the time, but we do not think that it is essential,
t first the birds seemed quite avid for their own droppings but this
ibit was soon lost. Anyone who has tried raising Ostriches knows how
uch devotion and skill it takes to induce these birds to eat sufficient

quantities of food. When left alone they will walk about, peck now am
then at conspicuous objects, and finally die of starvation. In captivit&apos;
someone has to take the place of a parent bird, not only during the firs
days but for a number of weeks, and knock at the dish or the floo
where the food is placed, or move the food in the dish or let it drop ir
front of the birds, etc. It will pay to take this trouble. Of course, it i
easier to raise a whole flock, but even so the mutual stimulation doe
not seem to suffice. I often put this sentence in my notes : " Now i
seems that the birds will soon settle by themselves "--but invariably i
proved necessary or at least advantageous to keep them company. B\
touching the bellies it was possible to find out if they were duly filled
It seems to be advisable to keep them company up to the age of aboui
three to four months.
Our birds developed nicely and never caused much worry. On sunny
days they were allowed to exercise freely in the open, which stimulatec
their appetite and made them less excitable. Furthermore, plenty o
exercise seems desirable for sound development. On the lawn the birds
revealed their herbivorous nature by pulling out and eating grass,
denuding whole areas of growth down to the ground. Eating, sleeping,
and preening were performed at regular periods. Feeding was most
intensive during the two to three hours before sunset and stimulating
the birds during this time of the day is considered most effective. In
other words : the opportunity of obtaining full bellies in the evening
should not be missed.
One of the birds was lost at the age of about three weeks. It had not
eaten for about two days and the dissection revealed its intestines
heavily filled with small pebbles. We do not know, however, if this
was the actual cause of death.
When the birds were about two months of age the pellets could be
offered dry in a separate dish and a calculated dose of a calcium-
phosphorus-vitamin-D-preparation was given in addition. At that age
the daily allowance per bird was about i kg. of chopped vegetables
(mostly alfalfa) and about half a pound of pellets and Spratt's Weet-
meet. I he daily exercise on the lawn was never discontinued, in spite
of the increasingly cooler weather and occasional fall of rain and snow.
Gold alone did not seem to hurt the birds when they were exposed, as
long as they kept moving. The birds obviously enjoyed these outings,
mostly indulging in lively dances. Room temperature often fell
below 20* G.
As the birds grew bigger enormous quantities of food were eaten.
In December cabbage was introduced in place of alfalfa, which was not
available any more, and the pellets were given as the only concentrate.
Consumption then amounted to about i kg. of concentrate and at least
twice that amount of vegetables per bird per day.
Dancing was often performed in the stable, too, which occasionally

tused skin lesions and bruises on the birds and broken windows in the
hiding. The windows consequently had to be screened by wire
itting. We did not worry about the birds' injuries at first, taking them
a sign of health and vigour, but after a while it became necessary to
ove the birds to larger quarters. In February the Antelope House
icame the new home of the birds, which had almost attained the
iight of a man. After a few days of excitement and decreased food
msumption the Ostriches settled down nicely. Soon the appetite
as regained and in March the daily consumption of each bird had
sen to 2 kg. of pellets and about 7 kg. of vegetables. &quot;They continue

&gt;N THE DISPLAY AND BREEDING OF THE KING
IRD OF PARADISE, CICINNURUS REGIUS REX
(SCOP.) IN CAPTIVITY
By Sten Bergman (Ronninge, per Stockholm, Sweden)

sprinted by kind permission from NOVA GUINEA. New Ser., Vol. 7, Part 2,
"th November, 1956.
The King Bird of Paradise, Cicinnurus regius (Linnaeus), is certainly
le of the most magnificent birds of the world. The vermilion colouring
&apos; the head and upper parts of the body, shimmering with every move-
ent, is of a supreme beauty. Even more remarkable are the adorn-
ents with which the male bird is furnished : the two superbly
seeping tail wires, each tipped with a gleaming, spirally curved disc.
1 addition, there are the brown, fan-like side-plumes bordered with
nerald green, which lie folded under each wing and can be spread
it at will.
Although the King Bird of Paradise was given its name by Linnaeus
. 1758, its life and habits in the tropical jungle are still very little
lown. When Hartert, in 1910, wrote an article about those Birds of
aradise whose eggs were at that time known (Novitates %oologies , 17 :
I4-490), he expressed his surprise that nobody had succeeded in
ading the nest of Cicinnurus , since in certain parts of its range in New
uinea and on a few neighbouring islands the bird is not, after all,
&gt; rare.
At the end of March, 1929, however, Wilfred Frost discovered the
rst and, as far as I know, hitherto only known nest. Phis find revealed
Le quite unexpected fact that the King Bird was a hole-breeder in
intrast to all other species of Birds of Paradise, which have open
-sts. The nest found by Frost was built in a small tree, about 7 feet
om the ground. He describes the nest as follows : " The nest hole

was small, about i^ inches in diameter, and approximately 18 inch
deep, but filled to within a few inches of the lip with palm fibre. Th
eggs, two in number, measuring 27-5 X 21 mm., were of a cream
white, flushed with pink, typically marked and curiously resembliru
except for size, those of Paradiscea apodal (Avicultural Magazine (4), 8
33 - 5 5 i 93 * 0 &lt;
The first live Birds of Paradise which came to Europe--two Parc
discea minor --were brought home in 1862 by Alfred Russel Wallac
and placed in the London Zoo, where a number of different specie
have since been kept, as in many other Zoological Gardens.
Up to the present, no Bird of Paradise has been bred in Europe
although some instances of egg-laying have occurred. As far as I know
the only species which has ever successfully bred in captivity befor
1956 is " Empress of Germany's Bird of Paradise " (. Paradiscea apod
augusicevictorice Gabanis), of which in 1942 one young was reared h
Prince Dharmakumarsinhji's aviarium in Bhavnagar, India (^oologica
New York, 28 : 139-144, 1943). In the Zoo of Surabaia, on Java
a King Bird of Paradise, according to Frost, laid two eggs which wen
hatched out, but the young died in the nest. The same female late
laid one more egg but failed to incubate it (. Avicultural Magazine (4), 8
33 ~ 5 &gt; ^S 0 )* I his, as far as I know, is the only attempt made by &lt;
King Bird to breed in captivity before 1956.
When returning to Sweden from two journeys to Dutch New Guinea
in 1948--49 and i952~53 ornithological research, I was permittee
by the Dutch authorities to bring to Sweden a number of live Birds 0
Paiadise for the purpose of continuing my studies and observations or
these birds and, il possible, to make breeding experiments with them
for my first permit I am much indebted to my colleague of the 1948-4C
expedition, Dr. M. A. Lieftinck, then Director of the Zoologica
Museum in Bogor, Java. For my second permit I have to thank
II.fi. the Governor ol Dutch New Guinea, Dr. J. van Baal, the formei
resident of West New Guinea, Mr. L. L. A. Maurenbrecher, and
Professor Dr. L. F. de Beaufort.
Among my Birds of Paradise were some male King Birds, Cicinnurus
regius rex (Scopoli). I did not, however, succeed in bringing home
any female of this species, but through the courtesy of Director
S* van Reesema and Ir. F. J. Appelman, of the Rotterdam Zoo,
I was permitted to exchange one male Cicinnurus for a female of the
same species.
In October, 1955, this female was joined with a male that had just
changed its plumage and the pair was allotted a space of i7^m 3
in my house. 1 he room was planted with a number of Monstera , Ficus,
Bougainvillea , and other tropical plants. The floor was covered partly
with sand and partly with moss. 1 he room had a constant temperature
of 25 C., legulated by thermostat, and the necessary moisture was

ected by squirting all plants and the moss with water every day.
vo sides of the room were lighted by two double windows on each
le and two electric tube lights were burning in the King Bird's room
: twelve hours a day--from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.--all the year round.
As nesting sites a vertical log and two nest-boxes were installed. All
e three nesting sites had different-sized entrance holes.
Shortly after the male bird had been let into the female's room, in
lich she had spent over three months waiting for him to finish his
oult, he started his courting. He knew her well, since their rooms
id been separated only by wire mesh.
He began his courtship by raising his tail and tail wires forward until
ey lay at right-angles to the length of the body. He then spread out
s wings so that they were slightly cupped, as shown in Plate 4.
arning towards the female, he constantly vibrated his wings, which
ere soon spread out to their full length.
Suddenly he changed his display completely. Instead of sitting on
e branch the next instant he was hanging upside-down with his feet
inging to it. His wings were still fully expanded and vibrating. The
11 was open, so that the yellow-green gape was plainly visible.
After hanging in this manner for nearly ten seconds he closed his
ings and, still in a hanging position, swung his body from left to right
r a few seconds. He then released his hold, dropped a short distance,
id flew on to the branch.
Some days later, at 11 a.m., the male bird was singing. The song is
mewhat similar to the song of the skylark, although not so loud,
/hen the male bird sings, the discs of the tail wires are in constant
otion. Whilst he was singing the female flew over and sat on a
ranch near to him.
He then expanded his wings and vibrated them. He moved closer
" her and sat on the same branch. Then he began displaying in the
$ual manner, i.e. he expanded the fans and drew them up towards
is head, as shown in Plates 2 and 3. At the same time he puffed out
le white feathers of the underside, so as to become almost spherical,
veeping his tail wires up over his back as illustrated by the photographs
1st mentioned. His head was raised obliquely upwards and constantly
vayed slightly from side to side.
During this display the male sat with his back turned towards the
male. She moved nearer to him, so that she was at a distance ol
pproximately 5 cm. from him. While he was displaying she
ccasionally picked at his feathers.
All through the winter the male was observed displaying for the
male almost every day and sometimes several times a day. I he most
sual time for the display was in the morning hours between 8 and 1 o
nd in the afternoons from 3 to 4. This applies to the winter months.

Swedish summer daylight, which during the lightest period, in June
lasts for approximately twenty-one hours out of the twenty-four, i
the Stockholm area.
In their native country Birds of Paradise are used to approximatel
a twelve-hour day and a twelve-hour night. During the winter month
in Sweden, where, in the Stockholm area, there is only about six and ;
half hours' daylight at the darkest period, the birds were, as alread
mentioned, exposed to twelve hours of artificial light. I have neve
noticed that they suffered any inconvenience from the long daylight ii
summer. As a compensation, they took one or several naps during th
day. During the summer, also, the display-times have been assigned t&lt;
the same time as in the winter, but the variations in regard to the tim.
have been greater.
The most frequent way of display of the King Bird is illustrated 01
Plates 2 and 3 ; in exceptional cases it continued for two minutes, bu
usually it was considerably shorter. When the male is really in th&lt;
mood for display he repeats his performance many times and it may b&lt;
observed at any time of the day, or in the evening.
When the display has continued for a while in the normal manner
with outspread fans and upbent tail wires, often the male will suddenh
turn round and continue the performance in the opposite direction
Usually he alters his display after this complete turn, so that the fan;
are drawn in under the wings and the bird, with wide-open beak
sways his tail from side to side in the manner shown in Plate 1
A departure from this attitude is that the fans remain expanded whik
the tail wires are swayed from side to side. The body remains stationar)
during this display.
Since 10th October, when male and female were placed together.
I have seen the inverted display many times during the course of the
winter and spring. Members of my family have also sometimes seen
this display on other occasions and, without doubt, the male often
performed his inverted display when he was not under observation.
I he first part of the upside-down exhibit usually continues for five to
ten seconds and the second phase, when he hangs with closed wings
and sways from side to side, takes a similar amount of time. But on one
occasion he hung with closed wings, completely motionless, for almost
one minute. 1 he various forms of display which I have observed agree
in all essentials with those described by Ingram for a bird kept in
captivity (The Ibis (9), 2 : 223-9, 1907).
During the course of the spring the female began to show increasing
interest in one of the nest-boxes, the one with the largest entrance hole
(diameter 8-5 cm.). In the middle of December, 1955, she had been
observed for the first time to sit in the entrance hole and look in and
a few days later she went inside. During the four following months she
made short, sporadic visits to the nest-box. In May, 1936, however, she

ew in almost every day, and sometimes she would stay in the nest-box
.r half an hour to a few hours. I provided the nest-box with moss,
ried fern leaves, and very thin grass so as to imitate a kind of nest,
loreover I put fern leaves and dried grass into the birdroom. The
male accepted this nest but completed it with the finest grass straws
le could find in the aviary.
In connection with her growing interest in the nest, the male became
lore ardent in his courtship. On the 24th May the male chased the
\0x25A0male from branch to branch. She moved slowly out of his way. Now
nd then she stopped and for the first time I saw her sitting in mating
osition with her body lowered against the branch and her tail raised,
ler head was pointed in an upward direction in exactly the same
lanner as the male's during the normal display. But when the male
ame near she flew away again. This happened several times. As soon
s the male saw her take up this position he immediately flew to her,
ut she continued to avoid him. Consequently no mating took place.
After the male had been pursuing the female for some time he
isplayed in inverted position, but even this acrobatic performance did
ot lead to any mating.
On 11 th June the female was in the nest-box the whole morning.
Vhen I left home at 10 a.m. to drive 30 km. into Stockholm she was
till inside the nest-box. The male displayed outside the nest-box in the
lorning, although the female could not see the performance. At noon
ay wife telephoned me to say that there was an egg in the nest-box.
Vhen I returned in the afternoon the female had come out and was
ating. I then went in and looked into the nest-box, which was so
onstructed that part of the front could be swung open by means of
i hinge.
The egg was exceptionally large in comparison with the bird and
&gt;roved to be a typical Bird of Paradise egg : cream-coloured, with
mmerous chocolate-brown streaks on the large end. The female
&gt;rotested strongly when I approached the nest and she continued to
:xpress her discontent all the time that I was inside her room. She
lew right up to me at the nest to see what I was doing.
Since there had been no egg in the nest the previous evening and as
he female had not spent the night in the nest-box, the egg must have
)een laid either in the early morning or forenoon ol 1 ith June. As the
emale was in the nest-box all through the day of the 11 th, except when
mating outside, the incubation must have started as soon as the egg was
aid. The following day I did not see her when she came out to eat and,
is I naturally did not want to drive her out of the nest-box to see il she
lad laid another egg, it was not until the 13 th June that I was able to
iscertain that two eggs were present in the nest.
During the incubation the male bird sat almost continuously on a
branch close beside the nest-box. He would occasionally stretch his

head to have a look, but he was never seen to enter the nest-box h
therefore never relieved the female during the incubation, neither di
he give her food during this period.
On the other hand, he displayed diligently for her in the neighboui
hood of the nest, partly in the usual manner, with expanded fans an
tail-wires erected over his back, and partly, on many occasions, in th
inverted position. He also repeatedly sat on a branch in front of th
nest-box and vibrated with expanded wings directly outside th
entrance hole, so that the female could not avoid seeing his courting.
On numerous occasions he sang his bubbling song right outside th
nest-box while the female was incubating. When she came out to ea
or to take a bath, he took the opportunity to look at the eggs and, later
at the nestlings, through the entrance hole.
As part of my preparations for eventual breeding I had placed i
bowl of finely crushed shells in the King Bird's room.&apos; Before laying he:
eggs, I had often seen the female eating these shells, but during the
incubation period I never saw her swallow any pieces of shell when sht
came out to eat. After the eggs were hatched and the young birds wen
in urgent need of calcium for bone-formation, she ate the shells several
times a day.
During the incubation period the female came out three or four
times a day to eat. As a general rule, she also took a bath once a da\
and preened her feathers very carefully. The length of her visits to the
ee mg place varied from a few to forty-three minutes, which was the
longest absence from the eggs that I observed. On that occasion the
female, after she had fed, had a thorough bath and then preened her
leathers for such a long time that both the male bird and I began to be
nervous about the eggs. All the time the male sat beside the nest-box
and repeatedly uttered his call of enticement : a-a-a-a-a (pronounced
as in English) when she seemed in no hurry to return to the eggs.
I had not seen the birds mate, and I dared not take the eggs out of the
nest to see if they were fertile. It was therefore with eager expectation
that I waited to see if there would be any results at the time I had
estimated.
On the morning of 28th June, after seventeen days, the eggs were still
un latched. At 3 p.m., when she came out to feed, I again inspected
the nest-box and to my great joy found a newly-hatched, dark red little
t ling anc one egg in the nest. 1 he egg-shell was not in the nest but was
found at the other end of the aviary.
I immediately went out to find fresh " ants' eggs " (more properly
tie pupae of ants enclosed in their cocoons), which are the finest food
one can give to an insect-eating bird. In an ant-heap about 10 km.
10m my house I succeeded in obtaining a good portion, which the
lemale readily consumed.
At 7 o'clock the following morning I looked into the nest-box and

&gt;und that the other egg also had hatched. It was evident, therefore,
lat the second egg was laid one day later than the first.
When the female returned to the nest-box, after I had visited it,
could see through the large entrance-hole that she regurgitated food
om her crop to feed her young. During the whole feeding period she
id her young in this manner.
Apart from fresh ants' pupae the family were given the following
)od : chopped yolk of hard-boiled egg, fresh raw meat in very small
ieces, finely-chopped apple, boiled rice and finely-chopped tomato,
laked raisins, small mealworms, small live grasshoppers, and fresh
whortleberries.
The fact that the eggs were hatched during the summer considerably
icilitated the feeding problem. I was able to obtain fresh ants' pupae,
ve grasshoppers, and fresh whortleberries. Six months before the
seeding I started to give both birds daily a portion of thawed deep-
rozen ant pupae.
When supplied with food the young emitted a suppressed, feeble,
leeping sound, rather like small mice. The nestlings had smooth,
laked bodies and were blind. All the young birds' droppings were
wallowed by the mother. When the delicate young birds would not
*pen their beaks she touched their heads very carefully with her bill.
On the fifth day I saw the young open their eyes for the first time.
Their gapes then were vivid yellow. When they were a week old
happened to open the front of the nest-box and swung it to one side.
Vfter a moment's hesitation the female fed her young just the same.
Bach young bird was usually given three to four regurgitated portions
it one time.
Every day I released a number of small grasshoppers in the King
Bird's room. The female caught them and, after she had pulled off
heir legs and swallowed them, regurgitated them to feed her young.
When the young ones were eight and nine days old respectively, she
vould feed them while sitting in the entrance hole, stretching towards
:hem and the young towards her.
It was evident that the female selected the food offered to her young.
3nce I watched her standing beside the young and regurgitating the
xmtents of her crop when a whortleberry appeared. She re-swallowed
this and regurgitated a mealworm instead. I his she placed well
orward in her beak and stuffed it into the gape of one of the young.
Thereafter she regurgitated again, brought up a whortleberry,
re-swallowed it, and instead regurgitated another mealworm, which
she gave to the other nestling.
Since the young birds' droppings never showed any trace of blue
colouring, it is obvious that the female did not feed them with whortle-
berries, though she ate these berries herself several times a day.
When the young birds were twelve days old nearly all their feathers

were still in their quills, which were bluish grey in colour, though oi
or two wing feathers had begun to sprout and these were brow
When not asleep or feeding the young birds spent nearly all their tin
preening their sprouting feathers.
At the age of fourteen days all feathers, both on the upper and unde
side, had sprouted. During this latter time the female had fed h&lt;
young almost exclusively on grasshoppers. When the young wei
fourteen days old I saw, for the first time, the female emerging froi
the entrance hole with the nestlings' droppings in her beak. She the
dropped them on the ground instead of swallowing them, as she ha
always done previously.
Between their twelfth and fourteenth day the young birds develope
so quickly that one could scarcely recognize them. At the fourteent
day the whole of their upper side was brown with more red-brown o
the wings. The underside was grey-brown with dark cross-bars. Th
legs and feet were blue, but duller in colour than those of the parent:
I hey could now sit like proper birds, preening themselves incessantly
or stretching their legs and wings and fluttering comfortably.
When, having taken some photographs of the young in the ope
next-box, I had reclosed it and had been absent for a while, I found o
my return that one of them was sitting in the entrance-hole. Shortl
afterwards it flew out and sat on a branch close by. I picked up th
young bird and held it in my hand for a while. The female flew roun.
about and warned very loudly and incessantly. She crept witi
expanded wings and tail along the ground and among the branche
and leaves round me. \\ hen I moved the fledgeling from one hand t
the other, the mother alighted on my head and pecked my crown witl
hei beak, beating me also with her wings. I he bird was very excited
but the male merely sat calmly at a distance and looked on. He ha
never been observed feeding the young ones, either in the nest-box, o
outside it.
d he following morning both fledgelings were out and were regularh
fed by the mother, as they sat on different branches. As the young wen
hatched on the 28th and 29th June, the eldest one had flown out or
12th July and the other on 13th July, they thus had left the nest at the
fourteenth day. In the jungle they would undoubtedly have remainec
longer in the nest and this would have happened here also had they noi
been disturbed by being photographed, when the front of the nest-box
had been opened.
Despite their youth, the young birds were quite sure holding on tc
their branches and flying to the branch for which they were aiming,
although they could only fly in a straight direction, as their tail-feathers
were only half a centimetre long. On the fifteenth day they could
already sit on one leg and scratch their heads. Sometimes one of them
would bend forward, turning round the branch and come up on the

[her side without releasing its hold, an art with which all my full-
rown Birds of Paradise are experts. All of them also are capable of
oing both forward and backward somersaults on their branch.
The female, after having fed the young in the nest, always waited for
leir droppings ; but she changed her behaviour after they had left the
est and spent the day in the open. When she had finished feeding her
oung she had the amusing habit of bending her head inquisitively
nder the tail of one of them and then sitting motionless waiting for the
roppings, but always in vain !
When the young were fifteen and sixteen days old, I saw them fight
ach other for the first time, which also happened the next day and on
weral later occasions. They would peck at each other with flapping
rings like small cockerels. Sometimes they would swing round the
ranch until one of them would force the other to loose his footing and
utter down.
Every evening towards dusk the young birds began to grow restless,
ying from branch to branch and from one end of the aviary to the
ther. It was obviously an expression of anxiety which so many birds
-el in the evening, when it is time to seek a resting place for the night,
it this time they uttered a cry which may be transcribed as tjao-tjao.
couple of weeks later they produced a flutelike complaining whistle,
iften uttered twice, and which later could be heard at any time ol the
lay. When the young birds were fifty days old I heard them for the
irst time give their warning cry, which was reminiscent ol the parents ,
ilthough it was not so harsh.
At the twenty-fifth day the young birds' appearance may be
lescribed as follows : beak, dark horn-coloured, lighter at the base,
ris, grey-brown. Upper parts ol the head, brown tinged with russet,
rhe back, grey-brown. The wings, grey-brown like the tail ; the wing
eathers decidedly darker brown. The greater wing-coverts and outer
vebs of the primaries red-brown. The underside, light grey with dark
:ross-bars, curved on either half of the underside. Closer dark cross-
)ars on the under tail-coverts. A light bar immediately above the eyes,
md over this a dark spot. The chin, grey-brownish yellow with small
lescending streaks and points. 1 he gape vivid yellow. The inner
interior part of the lower mandible and its borders, yellowish-green,
is also the upper mandible. 1 he legs and feet were blue, paler than
the female's.
At the twenty-fifth day the young birds' tail feathers were appr oxi-
mately 3 cm. long. At this age they were fed every day with whortle-
berries, which, as mentioned before, were never given to them when
&gt;till in the nest. Grasshoppers now formed a very substantial part of
their diet.
At the age of one month the young birds' tail leathers were nearly as
long as the female's. The young ones were much lighter on the under-

side than the female. The mother still fed them and when they begg
for food they uttered feeble cheeps whilst fluttering their wings.
The male's moult began by casting one of his tail-wires on 18th Ju
and the other on 19th June, while the female was incubating. T
female started her moult on 1 oth August, when the young were fort
one and forty-two days old.
When the young birds were nearly two months old they changed ;
their feathers on the sides and top of the head, and the entire ba
acquired a pure grey colour. They had also grown new feathers on t
under parts, where the dark cross-bars, especially on the flanks, we
strongly marked. These bars were broader than in the female, whi&lt;
was generally browner on the under parts than the young ones. T 1
greater wing-coverts, the primary coverts, and the outer webs of tl
primaries were vivid red-brown.
As I write these words the young birds are three months old. Lii
their parents they are both in splendid condition. They feed ther
selves with all the food they get, but the female gives them a titbit no
and then.
The male has now almost completed his moult and is extreme
elegant. It is only the tail-wires which have not yet reached their fi
length. The fans are not yet full grown either. Feeling that he h;i
regained his splendour he has started to sing and display. The fema
has completed her moult of all the feathers on the neck and head, ari
has also grown new feathers on the underside.
It now remains to be seen whether my King Birds will repeat the
breeding.
As far as I know this has been the first successful attempt at breedir
that has ever occurred with a Cicinnurus held in captivity.

By J. M. Spence (Port Elizabeth Museum, South Africa)
A nest containing five young Malachite-crested Kingfishers was
und near Port Elizabeth on 19th January. It was about 10 feet up
. a river bank, and had a tunnel about 12 inches deep, the actual nest
ivity was about six inches in diameter and extremely foul smelling,
he young were estimated to be about three weeks old. They were
wered with feather sheaths, some of which were already splitting to
weal the blue feathers on the back. A week later all the sheaths had
inished and the birds were fully fledged. Their droppings were
sry liquid and quickly absorbed in sand. When first taken from the
est the young would defecate in all directions, and il the droppings
appened to fall on the feather sheaths they would just run off, thereby
seping them quite clean. As they grew older the chicks would
ack away from the others and deposit the droppings well away
"om them.
Three of the young were taken and hand-reared ; they thrived
n strips of fish as well as ten to fifteen small whole fish per bird per
ay. When fed whole fish they would throw up a cast of the scales
nd bones.
For the two days after they were feathered the young birds made
o attempt to fly, then on the morning of the 28th they jumped one
y one to the edge of their box and flew strongly around the room.
Jeedless to say, they were immediately caged. The next day they
tarted to take an interest in any food that accidentally fell to the
oor while they were being fed, but made no attempt to pick it up.
&quot;he following morning a dish containing some small live fish in
hallow water was placed in their cage. Although obviously interested,
hey made no attempt to catch any until the 31st. Next day
hey were taking live and strips of fish. I found that raw fish is
ather inclined to come to pieces in water, so strips of donkey heart
^ere tried ; this proved very successful, and they took to it without
ny trouble. They were not hand-fed after they were five weeks old.
They are great bathers, and if not given a dish of clean water each
lay they use the feeding dish to wash in. Their quaint habit of
&gt;obbing their heads up and down was obvious from the day they could
ly, but they very seldom raise their crests.
They have two methods of " catching " their food, one by diving
ither from a perch or hovering above the food or else, by alighting
&gt;n the edge of the dish and pecking the strips of food out. These are
isually thoroughly " killed " before eating by being beaten on a
)erch. If the food is small fish they are always swallowed head first.

126 O. HIRTHE-FIRST BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY OF SEVERE MACAW
Although they are not as brightly coloured as the adult, they ai
nevertheless very beautiful, having the area between the eye and lor&lt;
a light buff. The cheeks and breast are dark grey-brown, with th
throat and crown as in the adult. The abdomen is a lighter color
orange than the flanks and shoulders. The rump and upper tai
coverts are bright metallic blue, while the mantle and back are brig!
metallic greenish-blue. The primaries are black, and the secondarit
and coverts dark blue with bright turquoise spots. The feet and lee
are orange underneath and grey above, while the beak is black wit
a white tip.
As you can imagine, they are very interesting and beautiful littl
birds, and make a wonderful addition to our fast-growing collection
of live birds.

dealer C. H. Krag, of this town. The birds were almost identical, onh
the ltd coloui on the forehead of the bird believed to be the cock wai
somewhat more pronounced. The birds seemed very attached to eacl
other, so I thought they must be a true pair. I put them in a compart-
ment of my largest aviary. This consists of a long brick building
60 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8 feet high. The house is divided intc
eighteen compartments, each approximately 3 feet by 5 feet, with a
3 feet passageway running along the back of the house. Each com-
pai tment has an outside flight, approximately 3^ feet wide, 20 feet
long, and 7 feet high. One box was hung in the shelter and another
in the outside flight. I he boxes were made of 1^ inch boards, approxi-
mately 1 foot by 1 foot and 2^ feet high. On the bottom of the boxes
I placed a layer of moist earth, and on the top of this a layer of peat-
moss, about 6 inches deep in all. Neither of the boxes was used for
sleeping. In spite of the very cold winter, 1953-54, the birds spent
all day in the flight, even the cold nights did not seem to hurt them
in any way.
The food consisted of sunflower seed, various millets, peanuts, and
groats. 1 hey also got all kinds of sweet fruit, apples, oranges, grapes,
etc. Strangely enough the birds did not seem to appreciate bananas.
Raw canot was given freely, and should, in my experience, always
be fed to nesting parrots and parrakeets. Also sprouted oats and

routed spray millet were given daily. The birds did not take ordinary
sen food, as usually given, with the exception of the yellow dandelion
3ssoms, which they took readily, but not the ripe heads. The
acaws seemed to thrive excellently on this food, and at the end of
ay, 1954, I thought that the birds would start nesting, as they
smed to be interested in the nest-box. Things, however, went
Terentiy. I give fresh branches in the flight, and every time I bring
w branches, the Macaws first bite off all the leaves, then the twigs,
d finally, gnaw off the bark. Macaws should always have fresh
anches for gnawing. This does them a lot of good and keeps them
cupied.
At the beginning of August the birds started to feed each other,
d I also saw a single attempt at mating. It really was a true pair,
n the 6th August the hen disappeared into the box in the outside
^ht and the cock spent most of his time in the neighbourhood of
e box. He also visited the hen several times a day and slept in the
&gt;x every night during the period of incubation. A nest inspection
is very difficult, as I was usually attacked by the birds. On the
ith of August I took a thin lath and gently pushed away the
rds from the centre of the nest, and an egg was visible on the bottom
the box. When checking again on the 24th of August, I saw three
gs, and these comprised the whole clutch. Apparently the eggs were
id every other day. I did not inspect the nest again until the 12th of
:ptember, when I saw a young bird, which seemed to be newly hatched.
hree days later, when checking the nest, I found another young one
ing dead, apparently crushed under the mother. The third egg was
fertile, and was removed. The remaining young one throve
cellently. Besides the ordinary food, I gave eggfood (hard-boiled
;g with biscuit), and boiled rice with milk and sweetened with sugar
id different sweet jams--this food, by the way, also being given at
tervals all the year round. The youngster left the nest on the
ith October, beautifully feathered, and was greeted by the parents
ith loud cries. A little later the young bird flew with the parents
rough the long flight, the parents taking good care of it. 1 he bird
)pears to be a cock, the red patch on the forehead being as big as that
the old cock. It is delightfully tame, and takes food from my hand.
The incubation period of the Severe Macaw is obviously 25-28
tys, and the young birds leave the nest when about 7 weeks old. 1 hey
e fed by their parents for quite a long time, but are independent
)out six weeks after leaving the nest.
In 1955 another young bird was bred, and in 1956 three. I hese
ere exhibited at the large bird show at Copenhagen in November,
id were awarded the c Sluis ' cup for meritorious breeding.

(Lagonosticta rubricata)
By G. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)
These notes are an addition to the previous article (Aviculture
Magazine, vol. 62, 1956, p. 128), and complete the study on the
Fire Finches commonly available to aviculturists in this country.
Appearance
I he Dark Fire Finch ( Lagonosticta rubricata) is also known as tl
Blue-billed Fire Finch, though this name is usually applied to tl
West African subspecies, which is the one most frequently importe
and the one on which these observations were made.
The cock is dark, perhaps dull, scarlet on the head, breast, and bell
and the mantle is a dark slate-grey. In this subspecies the dark gr&lt;
extends on to the nape and crown, but in others the head may 1
entirely red. The wings are a similar colour to the mantle, but perha]
a little browner. The rump is scarlet, as is the base of the black ta:
while the under tail-coverts are black. There is a faint white rim
the eye, and the bill is steel-blue. The hen is pinker than the cot
on head and breast with a small area of buff on the belly. The gener
shape is that of a small squat bird with a narrow head and prominei
bill.
This species is unfortunately being widely sold and exhibited ;
another species--Jameson's Fire Finch (L. jamesoni) . At one tin
the two were considered to be related subspecies, but they are no
separated. Jameson's Fire Finch is pinker on the head, light red c
the breast, and brown on the back : but the principal distinguishir
feature is the shape of the second primary feather. The first primary j
both species is vestigial, and what appears to be the first is in realii
the second. In Jameson's Fire Finch this latter feather tapers a litt
towards the tip, but in the case of the Dark Fire Finch it is cut awa
on the inner web towards the tip, so that the feather narrows sudden]
and the terminal portion is very slender. This feature is constant i
the different sexes and plumages.
General Behaviour
It is a rather nervous and furtive bird, resembling the Bar-breaste
Fire Finch (L. rufopicta ) in its habits. Like that species it has a crouchin
posture. If alarmed it tends to hide, and if free in a room will disappea
into the darkest corner or under furniture, and remain still and silen
I found that it quickly learnt to find its way around a room. Eve
before a nest had been made it showed preference for roosting i

box. In spite of its furtive manner I found it an aggressive species.
Vlien two cocks were put together one would chase the other con-
nually, one of the birds (I am not sure which) uttering a low, soft
tuc " note. When I put one with Senegal Fire Finches (L. senegala )
nd Lavender Finches (L. caerulescens) it dominated both.
all-note
The call-note is low-pitched, nasal, and slightly harsh--" kyew "
r " kyah ". It has a wide range of expression, from a soft, subdued
ote used between a pair when feeding or on the move, to a loud,
arsh version used in periods of excitement or isolation.
larm-note
This differs in form from that used by the Senegal and Bar-breasted
ire Finches. It is abrupt, similar to theirs, but higher in pitch,
nd is repeated in a rapid series that run together to form a single
ittling trill. The pitch is variable, becoming higher as anxiety
lcreases. It is accompanied by a crouching posture similar to that
f the Bar-breasted but with the head raised on a rather thin neck,
he tail is held to one side, half-spread and jerked sideways at each
&apos;all.
ong
The dangers of generalizations based on a study of too few specimens
rere brought home to me with this species, for the first cock that
possessed had a song which consisted merely of a long-drawn toneless
ill on a single flat note. It was only with subsequent birds that
heard the more normal song. The cock of a nesting pair did not sing
r hen the hen was on the nest, but used instead, low-intensity alarm-
otes together with a more melodious form of the call-note.
When the hen died the cock began to sing immediately and per-
stently. The song was melodious though generally high-pitched,
irprisingly loud, and consisted of short phrases frequently repeated.
)uring one period I timed it and found that it consisted of phrases
\- 2 \ seconds long, uttered at intervals of 5-6 seconds. In volume
nd pitch it reminded me of a Robin's song, but the style was mock-
iightingale. A typical phrase would consist of the rapid repetition
f a note, seven or eight times ; but there were frequent changes of
itch between phrases, suggestions of crescendo and diminuendo, and
jmetimes a short descending cadence. Once or twice I did hear a
lort trill reminiscent of the first cock&apos;s song.
iest-call
This was heard frequently during, and just after, nest-building,
t was a faint persistent clucking note repeated with great rapidity.

I 3 * C. J. O. HARRISON-NOTES ON THE DARK FIRE FINCH
I was not able to compare it directly, but would have said that i
was lower in pitch than the Senegal Fire Finch's call, which is ir
turn lower than the Bar-breasted's.
Display
This is similar to the display of the Bar-breasted Fire Finch. The
cock holds a piece of grass or a feather by its tip. It stretches ven
straight upright with head thrown back and head and neck feathers
sleeked down, while the belly feathers are a little fluffed and the tail,
half-spread. T he movement consists, as in the other Fire Finches,
of a series of vigorous upward jerks, usually in repeated sets of four
bobs. At each jerk there is an upward movement of the bill and in
many, possibly all, cases the head is turned alternately half to one
side and then the other, so that the grass or feather appears to be
waved jerkily from side to side while the bird is bobbing up and down.
There does not appear to be any special movement at the completion
of die display. I did not notice any specialized flight of the cock
while carrying display material.
Unmated cocks showed what I took to be an undirected display
homologous with the " stip " display in the Senegal Fire Finch.
In it the bird had a rather tense posture, upright, with head raised.
It continually repeated a single note which I called a "squelch"
note since it reminded me most of the sound when air is squeezed out
of a wet rubber sponge with a rush of tiny bubbles, and was also
reminiscent of the lwit of a thin twig swished through the air.
Each note was accompanied by an upward movement of the bill, and
terminated in a subdued click.
I was surprised that it did not appear at the end of the display of
the paired cock. When the hen died the cock began to intersperse
its song with periodic repetitions of the note. Finally, about two weeks
after the hen s death, it picked up a grass-stem and indulged in a
momentary display during which I was able to detect that the note
occurred, with the lifting of the grass-stem to one side or the other, at
each upward jerk of the bird ; but it was normally masked in my
cages by the heavy thud of the bird's feet on the perch as it bounced
up and down.
Other postures
\\ lien the pair were first put together there was a certain amount
of what appeared to be aggressive behaviour. I thought for a few
days that I might have two cocks. Both birds would take up similar
postures side by side, with neck stretched straight upwards, head
thrown back and bill raised, while the tail was cocked and half-
spread. In this position they would pivot from side to side, the bill-
tips occasionally touching as though one bird was parrying the thrust

the other. This occurred not only in the pair-formation period,
also in the early stages of nest-building.

Vithin a few days of being placed together a pair built a nest

t script
rhese notes complete my observations on Fire Finches to date,
will be seen that they are, with the exception of the Lavender
Lch, very similar species, with distinct differences of song and
;hter variations of display and calls that serve to illustrate both
ir relationship and the differences which enable them to preserve
ir specific identity.
[f it should be asked why they appear in these pages I would plead
it it is only through a knowledge of a bird's life and behaviour
it we can understand how best to keep it, and that it is only through
culture that it has been possible for the observations to be made,
tailed studies on these species in their natural habitat are still
king, and I hope that these notes will be of some value to future
dents.

Of my birds, I think a pair of Indian Zosterops has given me as
iat pleasure as any. This, I say, even though I have an Indian
ama who on many a warm night has charmed the silence with
tes that would intrigue a Nightingale.
The Zosterops arrived in the late spring and were liberated into
aviary considered suitable to their needs. Luckily the weather held
e for a considerable time and they did not appear to find the
iglish climate anything unusual. In Northern India, the sun deals
nstroke by day, and it can be cold to freezing at night.
The aviary, 15 feet long by 4 feet wide and 8 feet high, was built
ainst a very old brick wall. This was riddled with crevices and holes
ide by the hand-cut nails of former generations. They formed ideal

aviary was also protected from east and west winds. An apple tr
sapling, self-sown, grew tight to the bricks. It's branches radiate
and pressing hard against the wire roof, formed a canopy of leav
which effectively kept out rain.
For those who have not seen a Zosterops, let me say that they a
small, short-tailed, insectivorous birds, about the size of an Engli

bordered with white rims, which have earned them the name
Spectacled Zosterops. Knowing nothing of the nesting habits of the
active little birds, I gave them soft, dry meadow-grass and ha
In due course they became interested, and wove the hay into a rou#
bundle between the fork at the end of a horizontal branch aboi
six feet above ground.
Adjoining this aviary was another, but of larger proportions, beir
40 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 12 feet high. It contained some Chinqu
Pheasants, a pair of Senegal Touracous, a few parrakeets, and ah
a pair of Zebra Finches. At the partition top, a strip of wire allowe
the inmates to look into the Zosterops' aviary. The Zebra Finch
appeared to be fascinated by the " goings on" of the Zosterop
and were desperately anxious to get a closer view of the nest. I
last they discovered that a heaven-sent mouse had enlarged a hoi
where the wire adjoined the wall, and through this they squeezed.
I don't know what goes on in the minds of birds, but these Zebn
had fully made up theirs long before they passed the wire nettini
In no time they had that bundle of hay torn to shreds, and wei
preening themselves on a good day's work. You could almost he&lt;

It so happened that two little French poodles were being clippe
for show at that time. I threw a couple of handfuls of their brow
curly hair into the aviary. With evident delight, the Zosterops seize
upon it, and set to work to create a masterpiece of constructor

ibit of pulling a solitary large white feather over her back when
e weather was cold. I do not know exactly how long the incubation
ok, as she sat close and gave little or no chance of looking into her
'st. However, in a seemingly very short time, about a fortnight,
e was off hunting for insects.
Two children gathered ant-eggs from under the stones which
irdered the paths of the garden, and swept the hay-fields with
itterfly nets, catching quantities of flies, etc., from the grass tops,
t first the two babies looked like black spiders at the bottom of the
&gt; s t. They grew fast, and no parents could have been more zealous
caring for their wants. Eventually they left the nest as two grey-
een balls of fluff, and were coaxed by their parents to the top of the
)ple tree and on to the sleeping perch. With the two chicks between
iem, they made a charming picture. Later on they placed one baby
-tween them--the other had to take an outside seat. Somehow
think that the favoured infant was the hen. It appeared to be
nailer.
When the youngsters had grown to full size, and were able to fend
&gt;r themselves, the parents decided to build a new nest, and pulled
le old one to pieces. The cock, however, apparently also decided that
e could not tolerate another of his own sex in the aviary, and unseen
y anybody, he slew his son, reducing his pretty young head to a
iw skull. His daughter continued to live and sleep between the
arents as before.
Unhappily the weather changed, and they apparently decided that
le conditions were unfavourable for building, this much to my
igret, having just bought a colour film.

(.Bathilda rujicauda)
By Nicholas Gravem (Mill Valley, California, U.S.A.)
Of the so-called Australian grass-finches, I personally believe tl
Star finch or Ruficauda (Bathilda rujicauda) has been rather neglecte
as an aviary subject and particularly as regards its breeding. Here j
California, imported Stars are plentiful enough ; however, aviary-bre
birds are sadly scarce. I understand that this same state of affairs ah
exists, more or less, in Britain. Perhaps a few remarks on breeding the;
finches, over here, may be of interest.
I breed Stars and Gouldians indoors in cages measuring about 24 b
18 by 15 inches deep. These cages are built in batteries of four in a un
and aie tiuly box-cages with only the fronts open. I have never know
Stars use a nest-box like Gouldians ; and they are furnished with on
of those tiny, wooden-barred canary travelling-cages, with the bottor
knocked out, and fitted within the cage on its side.
It has been my experience that these birds generally, as Gouldian;
come into condition and breed during our winter months, going int
post-nuptial moult in our late spring or early summer. Howevei
I have found that Stars are very much more flexible than Gouldian
with regard to adapting their breeding cycle to the spring and summe
of our northern hemisphere.
After mating (by mating ", I mean pairing, not coition), the cod
pioceeds with most of the work of nest-building, the hen assisting to ;
minoi degree. Compared with a Gouldian nest, this is a very nea
piece of work. 1 he nest, built within the canary travelling-cage, is ;
globular affair with entrance in the side and is usually started with tin
coaisest material at hand and then receiving an inside lining of fine
dry grass and (supplied) feathers. " Egg sandwich " architecture--s(
frequently employed by over-zealous Zebras and less frequently b}
frustrated Gouldian cocks--is seldom resorted to.
rinee to five white eggs seem to be the rule, incubated for some
twelve or thirteen days. Very little egg-binding seems to occur witf
Stars, even when breeding is controlled in small cages affording so little
exeicise. (Gouldian hens, of course, are rather prone to this complaint
and I find that if a hen of this species becomes egg-bound and, more
particularly, il she reabsorbs the egg instead of expelling it, egg-
binding will always recur and the only thing to do is to retire thal
particular hen from the breeding-cage.)
Diurnal incubation is usually shared by cock and hen, with the hen
alone incubating at night ; though in occasional pairs both will occupy
the nest at night. 1 he incubation patch in the median apterium of the
hen is not as easily seen as it is on the abdomen of, say, a hen Gouldian.

believe cocks of the genera Bathilda and Poephila are without this
a tch--even though they do a large amount of daytime incubating--
ad perhaps this is why these cocks incubate only during the day and
le hens at night when greater heat is required to keep the eggs warm,
oth parents also share in brooding duties.
Upon hatching, the young are fed by both parents by regurgitation,
ith the cock perhaps doing more of the feeding as the nestlings grow,
oth cock and hen usually being model parents. I believe insect lare is
ecessary, or desertion will result. I use cut-up mealworms : one worm
iree times a day upon hatching and increasing the number of worms
y one each day until they have fledged. This is along the lines
iggested by Mr. Brooksbank in his excellent book Foreign Birds for
&apos;arden Aviaries. Mealworms are used as a matter of convenience and
ndoubtedly any number of other insect forms would also fill the bill,
have not found mealworms overheating to the parent birds or other-
wise objectionable, at least not while following the rationing schedule
s above. Millet sprays are before the birds at all times ; soaked sprays
/hen feeding young. I have had no real success with egg-food, bread
nd milk, sponge cake, etc., in regard to nestling grass-finches.
The basic seed diet consists of about three-quarters small canary
aixed with one-quarter white millet, shaken with a little G.L.O.
dost so-called finch seed mixtures are predominantly millet; mine
nostly canary. Also available at all times is a supplement mixture of
nore or less wild seeds that consists of: water-grass, sweet Sudan (red
,nd yellow), brassica, kohlrabi, lettuce (black and white), clover, rye-
grass, and phalaris. This latter gives the birds, I believe, more than
nough variety. Cuttlebone in its original form is not given. Instead,
1 mixture of ground cuttlebone, ground oyster shell, and ground
&gt;oiled egg-shells, in equal parts, with a bit of flaked charcoal added,
s supplied. The only green food offered is the small, young shoots from
ilanted rape seed. I am successful with this diet 5 and I am suie othei
iviculturists have equally sound diets, as well as successful systems of
ireeding and management for grass-finches. I don t belie\e in
logmatic ideas in reference to things avian.
I leave young Stars with the parents as long as possible after leaving
he nest, but still manage to get two nests per pair (infrequently three)
aer year. The young, upon leaving the nest, roughly resemble young
Glouldians, but with darker bills, and completely lack the papilke-like
&gt;pots of colour in the malar region, as possessed by the Gouldians ,
out, before leaving the nest, the young Stars have well-developed v\ hite
areas at the commisural point (angle of the mouth), as well as coloured
mouth linings. Incidentally, young Stars have quite daik toe-nails
compared with the lighter colour of tarsus and toes. Sexing ol young
prior to the postjuvenal moult is considerably more difficult than with
Gouldians (in which case the young hens exhibit darker bills than the

cocks) ; however, the fledged male Stars very soon attempt their sma]
warble of a song.
\oung Stars bathe almost immediately upon quitting the nest
unlike Gouldians, which I find a bit reluctant to bathe. (However
young Gouldians placed with young Stars soon imitate the latter am
bathe several times a day ; but when separated from the Stars, thes*
ablutions soon taper off. This would indicate that their innate bath
ing behaviour can be readily accelerated by visual stimulation.)
One drawback with aviary-raised Stars is that they almost alway
tend toward xanthochroism ; that is, the red feathering is replacec
with yellow or yellowish, quite unlike freshly imported specimens
Most aviculturists claim, I believe, that this is due to a dietary deficiency
and particularly as regards live insect food. However, as red in feather;
results usually from chemical substances (carotenoids) taken wifi
green stuff, I wonder if live food has any bearing on the matter. I have
heard that soya bean, in some form, has been successful with Tanagen
in this regard.

THE STORY OF A LAPWING

<bodyText confidence="0.945928739130435" page_id="58073350"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
By A. A. Clarence (Parkstone, Dorset, England)
Some years ago I was at a partridge " shoot ". It was of the " set-
piece " kind : every stand marked, with its number embossed in black
on a large white metal plate, which was fixed to a rod and stood
about 2 feet above ground. At the first stand of the day my position
was near the corner ol a high-hedged field. There I was surprised
to see a Plover standing motionless. I soon realized that it could not
fly and without difficulty caught it. I was astonished when I saw
that it had only one wing--the other was missing at the shoulder.
It had been cut off clean as a whistle '. dhe skin had drawn
together over the bone and there was no blood. A surgeon could
not have done a neater job.
I put the Lapwing in a gamebag and passed it to a farm-hand,
who was acting as my carrier. 1 his youth collected some worms
and gave them to the bird, which was very hungry. At the last
stand of the day I found myself in a field which adjoined the one in
which I had begun the day. At the base of the number plate lay
a severed wing.
No doubt the Plover had struck the plate in one of the fast
swooping dives which these birds delight in during the twilight hours
when, as though at a given signal, the whole world of night life
awakens, and Plover, Snipe, duck, and Curlew break into a
cacophony of sound, a chorus of calls, and whirring wings. On the

her hand, the Plover may have mistaken the white plate for one
&apos; his own kind, and on a tour of inspection met his Waterloo.
We put him in a rabbit hutch, well supplied with water and earth-
orms. Next day he was liberated into a 15-ft. square roofless pen,
&gt; which another pen of the same size adjoined. These pens were
Itiilt on solid sand and were used for rearing baby pheasants. An
Derture 10 inches long and 3^ inches high was at ground level in
der to allow the chicks to pass into the second pen, where grass
ifts and a dead mouse or two acted as cover and bait for flies.
I knew that Lapwings were quick-eyed birds, but I did not expect
lis one to find the " bob hole " instantly, the exit being so well
elow its line of vision. Having examined the second pen it returned
&gt; the first, and never faltered or had to look for the opening,
railed Partridges would wander up and down the wire division all
ay and never find it.
" Mr. Pee-Weet," as he was called, soon grew tame, and flourished
a the worms and insects brought to him by children, who were
athusiastic hunters on his behalf and derived great entertainment
om the bobbing and bowing, which he did from the top of a box
3vered with turf.
The winter set in and he looked very handsome and glossy standing
n this box. It was meant for him to shelter in, but he never used it.
In January there was a severe night frost ; this proved more than
is exposed side could stand. He was found frozen dead on top of
le box, much to my sorrow and that of his young friends, who
uried him in a boot box, with a wooden cross, flowers, and all !

By Tom Spence (Newburgh, Fife, Scotland)
Ill-luck or bad management, I don't know which, but certainly
have not done well with breeding of birds so far this season. I or
xample, out of about forty Ruddy Sheldducks eggs I have only eight
ucklings. The fertility was poor, but there was a dreadfully poor
,atch with deads-in-the-shell ; and of those that hatched a lair
lumber were murdered by the unnatural wretches ol broody hens
hat I had bought in. I have, however, a nice strong young brood
,f New Zealand Sheldducks, which by their very strength must invite
nisfortune on them !
The only lories which have laid have either eaten their eggs or
efused to sit on them, and truth to tell I am beginning to lose interest

in them. I still have about a dozen pairs and a good few single birds^
mostly hand-tame.
Last year I did very badly and reared very few birds. The only
relatively bright spot was the " Foxwarren " Green Peafowl. Thf
Peahen laid no less than 18 eggs before going broody, really three
clutches. Of these one was clear and one was infertile because of ar
imperfect shell. The rest were all embryonated, but unfortunatef
nearly all of those I trusted to an electric incubator died in the shell
Of those left with the Peahen or with broodies, nine hatched. Had ]P
written sooner, as I had intended, I might have been able t(
say that I had reared them all without loss, for until they were abou&apos;
seven or eight months old, I had no losses. Since then, however
one was killed (by a broody), one died of " cold weather Pasteurel
losis ", and two developed such crippled toes that I destroyed them
The survivors, one male and four females, are all good birds.
Phis year the Peahen has already laid two clutches totalling 14 eggs
The fust four hatched, four out of four, yesterday. They look strong
one male and three females, I should say. All the eggs so far candlec
have been fertile.
My little Demoiselle, a tame one, laid within about ten feet of the
dinmg-i00m and seemed likely to sit well, dhe egg, however, was
stolen, piesumably by the Jackdaws that infest my place, and the
shell found under a nearby tree. I was very sad at this and made
even more so by the way that her ladyship followed me around as
though I had stolen it. Luckily she has laid again and this time
I quickly substituted a Barnacle Goose's egg, boiled in coffee and
ink and splodged to simulate the Crane's egg. She took to this
without demur and is incubating within ten feet of the door ! If the
egg is fertile I may return it to her when nearly ready to hatch, or
I may lie tempted to try to rear it myself. I think the Stanley Cranes
are a paii , so do they most times and they are defending a nest area
quite fiercely. My attitude is one of interest quite purged of hope or
expectation. The European Cranes are still too young to breed,
though they are taming nicely. I have a veritable drove (six) ol
Vulturine Guineafowl, but they are all juveniles except for one, and
I can t expect anything this season, though they look in better form
than any ol my birds and are so tame that they follow me closely
round their acre paddock.
I hav c quite a few ducklings ol different species of Sheldduck and
geese, and of these I am particularly watchful over the New Zealand
Sheldducklings. There are also a few (precious few) baby pheasants.
Of the softbills, the Spreos finally revealed their sexes by laying
thice infeitile clutches at the same time. I know now that I had
thiee females. Luckily I had already a cock " which I now intro-
duced. He was a real " Peer Gynt " and a-man-for-all-three-of-them.

mng in one nest which all four are feeding. Strangely the third
male has not laid again, probably inhibited from doing so by the
mulus of the young. These four get on without a sign of discord,
it when I introduced a second male, a beautiful bird the " size of a
ckdaw," there was a most dreadful melee, and later I took out the
bits " which I was able to blow life into and which has recovered,

Mr. M. Horwood collected two nestling White-necked Picathartf
in Ghana, feeding them mainly, I believe, on earthworms, and
friend of his brought them to London by air. They are strong birc
with enormous appetites and they are so far thriving on the insecti)
mixture used at the Bird House and some mealworms.
Two Maned Geese, another Cormorant, various Gulls and Pheasant:
including four Swinhoe's, have been bred in the Gardens. Th
Green-winged King Parrakeets are nesting and another Swainson
X Red-collared Lorikeet has been bred. The Satin Bower-birds buil
a flimsy nest of twigs, bamboo and privet leaves. One egg was laic
but it was broken soon afterwards. Four Greenfinches have bee
bred in the British Birds' Aviary where a Stone Curlew is incubatin
three eggs. Four Zebra Finches have been bred and there are nests c
Blue Tanagers, Black-throated Cardinals, Malayan Glossy Starlings
and Black Crakes.
The Snowy Owls nested as usual and eight eggs were laid. Thre
of these were given to a Spotted Eagle-Owl whose own eggs wer
infertile and she hatched all three, of which two are surviving am
are now quite large. The Snowy Owl itself hatched several chicks
letting them all die but one which is flourishing and growing fast
An Australian Stone Curlew that was in Mr. Spedan Lewis's collectioi
at Leckford before the war now lives in the centre aviary at the Bin
House and continues to lay one or two eggs each year.

Das Buch vom Wellensittigh. By Curt af Eneiijelm. Edited b
Dr. Joaciiim Steinbacher. Verlag Gottfried Helene, Pfungstad
Darmstadt, Germany. Price 21.50 DM. (approx. 36^.).
Curt af Enehjelm, Director of the Helsingfors Zoo, is well know
to all readers of the Avicultural Magazine both for his achievemeni
in the field of aviculture and for his articles on the subject. Th
" Book of the Budgerigar " has been produced with the assistance c
Dr. Joachim Steinbacher and, as might be expected, this collaboratio
between two such well-known aviculturists has resulted in a moJ
comprehensive and informative work. Every aspect is dealt witl
starting with a description of the species Melopsittacus undulatus Sha^
in the wild, the history of its early importations and first breedings, an
the development of the varieties from the first mutation known, i
Belgium in 1872, to the countless colours which are available to-da)
1 he chapter on housing deals fully with cages, aviaries, and flight
and is illustrated with photographs, drawings, and diagrams. Advic
is given on buying birds, the points to look out for and avoid bein
clearly given, and the author emphasizes that the cheapest bird i
seldom the best. His recommendations on how to treat birds durin
the period immediately after purchase is particularly helpful. He als
says that in buying Budgerigars it should be borne in mind for wha
purpose they are required, whether as a pet, for the pleasure of keepin
a few birds, or for breeding. He states that, as with all breeding c
animals, it is better to start in a small way with first-class specimens
In the chapter on breeding the following aspects are dealt with-
choice of birds, breeding season, number of broods, pairing, laying c
e gg s ? aR d brooding, young, control of nests, foster-parents, rings an&lt;
the keeping of a record book, and points out the importance of th
latter. There are also chapters on feeding and care of Budgerigan
moult, illness, l,t French moult," tame and speaking birds, and keepin;
Budgerigars with other birds. Finally, there is full information oi
colour breeding which occupies more than half the entire book.
1 here are 6 coloured plates, each depicting two varieties, by th
English artist, A. Vowles and 41 black and white illustrations.

There is no doubt that the group of birds popularly known as Wild-
d, which includes the swans, geese, and ducks, has become much
1 re popular in recent years than was the case formerly, when most
iple thought of a wild goose or duck only as something to be shot and
en. This increased interest is due, no doubt, to the very fine pictures
2 sees nowadays of the various species, drawn by the few artists who
\0x25A0cialize in the painting of these birds ; and in the establishment of the
ldfowl Trust and its grounds at Slimbridge where the finest collec-
n of wildfowl is to be seen. Very few people have an idea of the
mber and variety of species of these birds that occur in our own
mtry and a book dealing with them was much to be desired. Such
jook would not be of much value unless it were well illustrated, and
th pictures in colour; and it must include all the species that occur in
itain.
Such a book has now appeared and we welcome Wildfowl of the
itish Isles, by Peter Scott and Hugh Boyd, as adequately filling a gap,
it contains a full description of plumage, nesting habits, and range,
well as a first-rate coloured illustration, of every species, even
:luding some that are only occasional visitors and some, such as the
andarin Duck and Canada Goose, which were introduced but have
:ome established with us. There are fifteen coloured plates, some
itaining three or more species, all drawn by Peter Scott, and
hough we have seen some of these before in his very excellent
ports of the Wildfowl Trust, they are none the less welcome in this
npact form.
The only fault we have to find with an otherwise excellent book is
; absence of an index, of which the Table of Contents does not quite
te the place.

Notes on a Collection of Parrots
The following notes on my birds may possibly be of interest to some of our reader
Starting with the successes :--
Roseate Cockatoos.--The cock of this pair is one of the late Duke of Bedford
split-albino Roseates and was obtained from Mrs. Clark, of Maidsmere. Last year tl
hen laid three eggs, and reared three beautiful youngsters, one of which is an albin&lt;
It is white where the normal is grey, its breast is a lovely pink flecked witl
white, giving a pearl effect, the under-wing feathers are very deep pink--nearly m
it has the red eye, a flesh-coloured beak and feet. From what records I have been ab!
to look up, I believe this is the first albino Roseate to be reared in captivity.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos, reared three youngsters.
Blue Ring-necks, reared two youngsters.
Lutino Ring-necks, reared three youngsters.
Turquosines, reared three.
Splendids, reared one.
Illiger's Macaws, laid three eggs, all were fertile, but did not hatch.
Pileated, hatched two youngsters which lived for three weeks but died of col
when the hen stopped brooding.
Brown's, had three youngsters in the nest on the 2nd March, but all died on th
night of the 15th March, when we had snow and 19 0 frost.
Crimson-wings, laid three eggs, two were fertile but did not hatch.
Derbyans, laid two eggs which proved infertile.
Amazon Parrots, laid two eggs which proved infertile. I am afraid the hen is to
old for any further breeding successes.
An interesting happening was that three 1955 bred lutino Ring-necks developeJ
their pink rings ; two of these birds were bred by Mr. E. N. T. Vane, the other b,
Mrs. Clark.
At the time of writing the Cockatoo population at Mount Pleasant is as follows
seven Leadbeater's, four Citron-crested, seven Roseates, two Gang Gangs, and on

How does one sex softbills ? Raymond Sawyer returned my other Rothschild&apos;
Grackle two weeks ago, and when I put them together they looked as obvious a pai
as one could imagine. To confirm this my old bird sang like mad, and they preenec
each other and he started breaking off twigs in a most business-like manner. Thei
the " hen " began to pursue the " cock " in a rather half-hearted way and he looket
quite dejected. A few days ago the " cock " began to pursue the hen in a decidedh
purposeful way, and later I rescued the hen from the ground, luckily before then
was any real damage done to her. I still think they are a pair ! ! As Frost says
these grackles, sing, mate, or fight, quite irrespective of sex.

(Ducula aenea )
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The Green Imperial or Bronze Fruit Pigeon has a very wide dis-
dbution, being found in India, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Indo-
china, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Flores, Borneo, Celebes,
hilippine Islands, etc. There are, consequently, numerous races,
s many as fourteen being recognized.
This pigeon may be common in the wild state, but it is very seldom
ien in captivity in Great Britain. The Zoological Society of London
iceived their first specimen in 1866, a second arriving the following
ear, with three more in 1871 : other arrivals were 1878, one ;
883, one ; 1884, three ; 1892, one ; since when there have probably
een others. The only record of private ownership is the pair of the
hilippine race ( D . a. chalyburo ) collected in 1903 by Walter Good-
llow for Mrs. E. J. Johnstone.
Pigeons collectively do not enjoy the popularity with aviculturists
ley perhaps deserve. The smaller Fruit Pigeons, on the rare occa-
ons they are imported, usually find ready buyers as the majority
~e so very beautiful. But the larger species, such as the present
hich measures 15--17 inches in length, would probably prove almost
asaleable, except to a zoo--and that is really the best place for them.
In August, 1954, a London dealer offered us five Green Imperials
heir origin being unknown it was, of course, impossible to determine
te race) and despite the fact we had no suitable accommodation
e bought them. Fortunately, John Yealland, as on many other
:casions, both before and since, kindly eased the situation by taking
iem on deposit at the London Zoo : and there they remained for
iarly two years, until May, 1956, when they were finally trans-
rred to our newly constructed range of pigeon aviaries. Having
&quot;en at the Zoo for so long one would have thought they would have
ien very steady and that nothing could disturb them. But such

146 A. A. PRESTWICH-BREEDING OF THE GREEN IMPERIAL PIGEON
was far from being the case ; they were exceedingly timid and on the
slightest pretext would panic, somehow " half-roll " and hang
suspended from the roof of the flights--it will perhaps be remembered
from past accounts that the flights of these particular aviaries are
composed entirely of close-woven wattle fencing, except the roof
which is wire-netting. However, they gradually quietened down and
at the present time are as steady as one could reasonably expect.
We assumed that if, as we hoped, they attempted to nest it would
be some time during March, April, or May. We were reconciled
to the fact we had missed the 1956 breeding season and so we were
not disappointed that they showed no signs of nesting during the
remaining summer months. Autumn and winter passed and they
appeared to be troubled not at all by the cold. At the Zoo they
had had a heated house to use if they were so disposed, but with us
they have only half-open shelters, facing north ; and as often as noi
they did not use them but roosted out. So they may be considerec
quite hardy.
We experienced considerable difficulty in pairing them up as ir
coloration and size the sexes appear to be exactly similar. Finally
mainly as a result of trial and error, we sorted out what we believec
to be two pairs ; the odd bird being paired with a surplus Piec
Imperial.
Wooden seed-trays were provided as platforms for the expectec
nests, and roughly formed foundation nests of straw were added as ai
incentive. Straw, however, proved an unsuitable nesting material
In common with some other Fruit Pigeons this species has somewha
specialized feet, very strong with broad soles, developed to enable it t&lt;
clamber about branches and so reach fruit that would otherwise b
difficult of access. While indulging in courtship pursuit they frequent!
landed on the platforms, with the result that the straw was draggei
out and scattered. Hay proved a quite successful alternative. Th
actual nests were of a very scanty nature--little more indeed tha
a few wisps of hay.
At the beginning of January we started dusting the food wit
powdered cuttle-fish bone--this with a view to obviating egg-layin
troubles that might be due to any calcium deficiency. It certainl
had the desired effect as none was experienced.
Pair No. 1. On 9th March an egg was laid in the sand at the froi
of the flight. It was unfortunately punctured. On 1st April an egg wt
laid in the sand at the back of the flight and another was found in t!
nest : both of these were transferred to domestic pigeons, but the
proved to be infertile. A fourth egg was laid on 22nd April, but w;
deserted after a week or so and was removed on 3rd May. The measur&lt;
ments of three of these eggs were 42 X 32 mm., 42*1 X 32-6 mrr
and 42*2 X 32*5 mm. ; they were pure white with a slight gloss.

A. A, PRESTWIGH-BREEDING OF THE GREEN IMPERIAL PIGEON 1 47
Pair No. 2. An egg was laid on 27th April, but was thrown out of
le nest and broken on 7th May. A second egg was laid on 1st June,
he female settled down and as incubation progressed she became
icreasingly tame, eventually so much so that towards the end of the
eriod she even allowed herself to be stroked while on the nest. Both
arents spent a great deal of time on the nest. We were unable to
scide whether the male was actually assisting in the incubation or
hether he was merely keeping his mate company. During the
iree or four days prior to the hatching both hardly left the nest,
he egg was found to have " starred " on the afternoon of the 20th
id had hatched by next morning. The incubation period is believed
) have been eighteen days. It is, however, rather difficult to determine
lis point with any accuracy because the female did not begin seriously
&gt; incubate until several days after the laying of the solitary egg.
The nestling in down was dark rufous above and pale rufous-brown
clow. The female brooded it very closely, so closely in fact that it
ive cause for anxiety as the weather part of the time was very hot
ideed. This close-brooding lasted for about a week and may have
sen the reason why the young one appeared to be very slow to
svelop--at least by domestic pigeon standards. It then grew rapidly,
est it leave the nest prematurely a heap of straw was placed beneath
&gt; break its fall. This, however, proved to be an unnecessary precau-
on. It was strong and robust and by 1 ith July was perching on the
Ige of the nest, managing to reach a perch the following day and
Lenceforward finding its way round the aviary quite easily.
On leaving the nest the young one appeared to be an almost exact
:plica of its parents except that it was, of course, very much smaller,
was a little less brightly coloured, with the legs and feet paler, but it
ad quite a high gloss on the back and wings. It throve amazingly
id was, and is, a great credit to its parents who, in their turn, at
1 times behaved in a really exemplary manner, even now with
wer a hint of spitefulness.
Food. In captivity the feeding of these large pigeons presents little
fficulty : they will thrive on a very wide variety of foods. We have
lown one species do very well, for a time at least, on damsons and
&gt;aked brown bread !
Our own staple food consists of apples, bananas, tomatoes, and dates,
iced, mixed together and dried off with coarse biscuit-meal. The
&quot;ying off is very important, otherwise the birds will soon become
iry soiled round the head, neck, and breast, and look very unsightly.
It have tried several biscuit-meals and found the most satisfactory
&gt; be " Stamina " Poultry Biscuit Meal, which we put through a
incing machine. To this staple mixture we add, as available, a
rge variety of extras, grapes, cherries, plums, pears, pomegranates,
een peas, chopped lettuce ; boiled potatoes, carrots, rice ; soaked

sultanas, apricots, and figs. We do not give any form of milk-soj
soaked sponge-cake, or insectivorous food, as is sometimes recommende
for some of the smaller species.
The food for a dozen Green and Pied Imperials takes quite a b
of preparing. It does not, however, need to be chopped very fine!
Both these species have enormous gapes and are capable of swallowir
incredibly large pieces. In the wild state they are partial to nutme;
which they swallow whole with ease : later, when the peel has bee
digested, the nut is disgorged.
From the time the young one was hatched a heaped teaspoonful &lt;&apos;
" Bemax " containing a couple of drops of cod liver oil was sprinkle
on the food.
Water. The authorities are still somewhat divided on whether tb
pigeon drinks in the wild state. There can really be little doubt th;
it is a regular drinker. Naturally, we provide water at all times, bu
as yet, have never seen one drink.
Postscript .--The young one was separated from its parents c
6th August as they showed signs of nesting again. An egg was in fa
laid on 9th August and duly hatched on 1st September. The squc
is at present only two days old, and much now depends on the weathe
As described above, A. A. Prestwich has bred the Green Imperi
Pigeon (Ducula aenea). It is believed that this may be a first success.

species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to cor

There is a group of large woodpeckers found in North and Central

:ckers. Members of this group practically all fall under different
nera, the only reason for calling them a group at all is their somewhat
nilar appearance. They are all crested and have some semblance of a
hite V on the back. This group contains the rapidly disappearing
orth American Ivory-billed Woodpecker and the Mexican Imperial
bodpecker, the largest of all woodpeckers, measuring 20 to 22 inches,

voured, the Pileated Woodpecker and the one we are now concerned
ith, the Pale-billed Woodpecker (Phoeceastes guatemalensis ) are two.
ther members are found south of Mexico.
The members of this group have not often been kept in captivity,
he feeding habits are so demanding that few people would assume
ch a burden. George and Evelyn Whitney, of Elsinore, California,
d assume this challenge, and the following information was compiled
the hope it may add to the general knowledge of these magnificent
rds.
George Whitney, Jerome Buteyn, and Pat Murphy took a trip to
in Bias, Nayarit, Mexico, in the early part of May, 1955. They are
1 bird enthusiasts and the trip was one of observation with the hope
bringing something home for their collections.
A Pale-billed Woodpecker's nest was discovered a few miles from
in Bias along one of the forest tracks. The nest was in an old, rotten
ilm tree about 16 feet from the ground. The palm had broken off
the junction of a previous woodpecker's nest. The wood was soft
id pulpy. Two unfeathered young were taken ; from the colour of
ie skin and pin-feathers of the crown, we know they were a pair,
ne was red and the other was black, the red-crested was the male
id was also the larger. The two birds ate mealworms readily, and
p meals were missed. The female, regrettably, was accidentally
lied before they got home.
Coming back from Mexico, 108 degrees temperature was en-
mntered in the Arizona desert and all the mealworms died. T he
hole of the last day home the bird survived on those worms.
A short while after the bird's capture several black specks were
)ticed under the skin. These grew quite large ; one of them was
need and a large grub-like creature filled with blood was squeezed

out. Seven or eight of these parasites were removed and what futur
effect these might have had can only be speculated.
The bird was fed exclusively on mealworms for the first two month&apos;
By this time he ate about fifty a day in two feedings. Other insect lif
was tried during this time and it invariably caused indigestion
Hard-boiled egg yolk was introduced and eventually the whole c
the yolk and part of the white was consumed every day. He had ,
liking for " mocking bird food ", though objected if it was dampened
The most notable thing connected with this bird was his sensitiv
digestive system.
It was felt that an effort should be made to get the bird on a mor
varied diet, and since these woodpeckers eat a small quantity of berrie
and fruits in season, one soaked raisin was fed the bird. For two days b
moaned and complained with a stomach-ache. A week later he wa
again given a soaked raisin and again he complained, but for a shorte
time. The raisin was given with increasing frequency until it became ;
staple item. In season he also got two grapes each day, but he had t(
be started on these half a grape at a time and still he was upset. Th&lt;
tiniest piece of apple produced the same results until eventually he wa
eating a piece about the size of a thumb-nail at each feeding.
At one time the woodpecker got indigestion that continued for tw(
days. The Whitneys were at their wits end trying to figure the cause
It was found that when potatoes, for moisture, were put in the brar
containing mealworms the worms became toxic and the bird invariable
was sick. Apples used for the same purpose caused no ill-effects nor die
the flat cactus leaves. These leaves are preferred by most California
aviculturists and are cut in strips and laid on top of the bran. He wa&apos;
very fond of bread slightly dampened with milk but this always gave
him indigestion so it was given sparingly.
The moult was made gradually so the bird always looked in top con-
dition with a fine sheen on the feathers. George thought it odd, but the\
never found any of the red crest feathers. In the spring the normally
white areas of the bird, the wing patches, and the V on the back, turnec
bright yellow. George thinks this may be due to the sulphur conten
in the egg yolks given.
The woodpecker was given a lot of freedom in the house anc
became increasingly destructive until he was about two months old
At this time he attacked the wood panelled den and in a short time had
a hole that soon would have gone through the wall to the outside. He
was put in an all-metal cage 4 feet square and 2 feet high where he
quickly adjusted himself. For preoccupation he would busily pulverize
a piece of two by four wood put in his cage every few days. He disliked
a small clapper bell intensely and spent much time worrying it.
George found the bird would go into battle stance, raise the crest as
far forward as it would go, when he tapped the water container with

take on a glazed stare. It was definitly threatening. The woodpecker
never acted this way to Mrs. Whitney.
The loss of the bird was caused after two years in confinement when
the Whitneys ran out of mealworms, the principal item in the diet.
When their stock got down to 500 they would order more from their
dealer. The 500 reserve would last ten days, it generally took only
three or four days to receive the worms but they allowed a grace period
to cover any delay. This time a severe delay occurred and the worms
were not sent until fourteen days after they were ordered. The
Whitneys made every effort to get them from local people, but nobody
carried them in any quantity and with the diminishing supply of worms
the bird soon died. The loss was felt very strongly.
From the trials encountered with this bird, they feel it would be
impossible to maintain a captured adult. The Whitneys plan to obtain
another youngster of this group and see just how much they have

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I have always had a particularly soft spot in my heart for Senegal
Parrots as I had a delightfully tame one for 21 years, and I am conse-
quently very pleased to be able to record the successlul bleeding of the
species here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm this 1957 season.
It seems that this may be a first breeding. Apparently they are said to
have been bred in 1886, before the Avicultural Society had come into
existence, but our Hon. Secretary, Mr. Prestwich, who is I think
acknowledged to be the chief authority on the subject, wi ote to me
saying that he had " always regarded the. 1886 report as rather more
than suspect ".
Before the war we had a very fine-looking, and I should ha\e said
obvious, pair of Senegals here at Keston, but, although given every
opportunity to do so, they never made any attempt to breed, so after we
had had them for about three years, we parted with them.
Then after the war we decided to try again, this time with a
couple consisting of one we had purchased and one that had been
kindly sent to us by Miss Knobel. They are by no means easy birds to
sex, particularly single individuals, but Miss Knobel had rightly
assumed that her bird was a hen and ours fortunately turned out to be
a cock. As a breeding proposition, however, they did not seem a vciy

promising pair owing to their extreme wildness, both of them--as they
still do dashing panic-stricken into their shelter uttering their worst
slate pencil screeches, if anybody went near their aviary.
They were very secretive about their nesting operations and I
personally never saw either of them taking the slightest interest in their
nest-box, but, as the hen eventually disappeared and as there was no
sign of a corpse in the aviary, we assumed that she was sitting. This was
in May and some time later, when both birds were in the flight and
dashed headlong into the shelter, we decided to shut them in and have
a look in the nest-box. The inspection revealed three half-grown young
ones, all of which have been sucessfully reared and are now flying with
their parents.
The first one to fledge, which had the curious habit of frequently
going back to spend long periods in the nest-box, came out about 6th
July, and the other two some four days later. They are very fine young-
sters, as will be seen from the accompanying photograph, which my
partner Alec Brooksbank took when the youngest of them had only been
out of the nest a couple of days or so.
Actually the first intimation I had that they were starting to fledge
was when one morning I approached their aviary and was astonished
to see a Senegal Parrot sitting calmly on a perch instead of dashing
wildly into the shelter ! Closer inspection of course revealed its dark
eyes, but the only difference from its parents in plumage was its very
dark grey crown and pale ashy grey cheeks, as is the case with the other
two. Altogether I don't think I have ever seen such grown-up looking
young ones--newly-fledged Blue-fronted Amazons, for instance,
looking such very obvious juveniles.
1 he nest-box, measuring about io inches square by 24 inches deep
with half a coconut husk fixed in the bottom, was hung up under over-
head cover in the open flight.
In addition to their staple diet of sunflower, canary, hemp, and
peanuts, the parent Senegals were given, while rearing their brood, a
considerably increased amount of hemp and various extras. These
consisted of boiled potato and carrot as well as a large cube of stale
bread previously soaked in sweetened milk to which Virol, etc., had been
added. These were given daily and we also offered them boiled white
fish of which my tame Senegal was so fond--but this they refused to
sample, so it was discontinued. They always have spinach beet leaves
and apple about twice a week throughout the year, and during the
rearing period, both were given daily.
Finally, for the benefit of anyone who might not be familiar with the
appearance of these small parrots, I would just add that the Senegal is
green with a grey head, and with the lower breast and abdomen
01 ange-yellow. Its total length is a little over 9 inches.

ater, dated 31st May, is quoted : " We received five of these

mg, died, it was a rather curious experiment. They passed all last
iter (1887-1888) in the open flight where you saw them, without
er shelter than several wooden boxes."
have always regarded the Sheridan event as rather more than
pect, mainly because in the wild state the number of eggs is generally
:ed to be two. Four certainly seems to be a rather large brood,

California, U.S.A.
A Double-wattled Cassowary chick (Casuorius casuarius aruens
was hatched on 30th April, 1957, in the Zoological Gardens of S;
Diego. In its history of forty-one years this is the first record of
Cassowary chick to be hatched successfully in the gardens.
The Cassowaries are the only members of the group of struthio
birds that have become adapted to life in the jungle. One of the me
primitive living birds in the world to-day, this entire group h
proved to be the most difficult to breed in captivity. Their heads a
protected from thorns by a heavy casque and their powerful legs a
fitted for crashing through tangled brush rather than for dashing
high speed over open plains. The bare portions of the face, as well
a long narrow space on each side of the neck, are brilliantly coloun
in blue, red, and yellow, the variations in shading being an importa
factor in the separation of forms. About twenty have been describe
ranging from north-eastern Australia to New Guinea and smi
adjacent islands.
The plumage of the Cassowary is much like that of the Emu, havii
the same well-developed aftershaft. In structure, however, the wing
quite different from those of other struthious birds, the flight feathe
being represented by five or six hard, stiff quills. When our Cassowari
are angry the wing feathers are scraped along the fence making a lou
rattling sound which warns one of their temper.
Cassowaries are fierce, pugnacious creatures, able and ever-willing
deliver stunning blows with their powerful feet. Wounded birds a
treated with respect by natives in the bush and captive specime:
receive watchful consideration from their keepers and must be watchf
constantly.
Male and female usually cannot be kept together unless in a vei
large enclosure. A compatible pair of adult Cassowaries is rare
seen in captivity.

By Burton Benedict (Floreal, Mauritius)
The aviculturist who steps ashore in Mauritius will feel very much at
\0x25A0lome, for around him he will see some of the commonest aviary birds of
Surope and America. The Indian Mynah (Acridotheris tristis) hops
dong the road ; the Bulbul (Otocampsa jocosa) and Green Singing Finch
Serinus mozambicus) flit about the garden ; flights of Indian Ring-necked
I'arrakeets ( Psittacula torquata) wing screeching overhead ; flocks of Red-
-ared Waxbills ( Estrilda astrild) and Spice Finches ( Munia punctulata)
lover about the fields, and colonies of Spotted-backed Weavers ( Ploceus
ipilonotus) build their elaborate nests in the casuarina trees by the sea.
These pleasant observations may be interrupted by several reflections
i--surely these birds are not native to Mauritius, their very names
letray their countries of origin as Africa and India. How did they
reach this tiny island, barely the size of Surrey, which is some 1,400
miles from the east coast of Africa and over 2,000 miles from India ? It
is difficult to imagine a Waxbill or a Mynah flying such distances over
water. Clearly they must have been brought, but why ? How ? And by
whom ? Wandering further afield one sees more and more of these
avian immigrants. The ubiquitous House Sparrow (Passer domesticus)
is seen in every gutter, though it is the light-coloured Indian variety
rather than the one familiar to English and American cities. Driving
along, Necklace Doves (, Spilopelia chinensis) and much smaller Zebra
Doves ( Geopelia striata) rocket up before the car. Everywhere in the
island the story is the same. Another question springs to mind where
are the native birds of Mauritius ?
Of the twenty-five species of birds once endemic in Mauritius only
nine remain, and only one of these, the tiny, pearly Manioc-Bird
( Malacirops borbonicus ) is at all common. T hese little softbills, about the
size of a Zebra Finch, are to be seen flitting about the garden uttering
a metallic chirp. The local name, Ck Pit-pit," reflects this sound. The
Manioc-Bird resembles the much rarer Olive White Eye (^osterops
curvirostris) but lacks the white eye ring. The Olive White Eye is more
grey than olive, but otherwise resembles the Zosterops kept by
aviculturists. The other endemic Mauritian birds include a small
Peregrine Falcon, the Mauritius Kestrel ( Falco punctatus ) ; a very rare
parrakeet, the Mauritius Parrakeet ( Psittacula echo), which resembles
the Indian Ring-neck but is rather larger; the extremely rare and

beautiful Mauritius Pink Pigeon ( Nesoenas mayeri) ; the almost extinct
Mauritius Cuckoo-Shrike ( Coquus typicus) ; the Mascarene Blackbird
(Microscelis borbonica ), which is sooty-grey with a blackish crown ; and
the Mascarene Flycatcher ( Tchitrea bourbonnensis), an attractive bird
with a black head, grey breast, and russet wings and tail.

B. BENEDICT-THE IMMIGRANT BIRDS OF MAURITIUS
When the Portuguese landed in Mauritius in 1507 they found no
human inhabitants, but a rich and varied avifauna. Most famous oJ
these now extinct birds was the almost legendary Dodo. A living
specimen was exhibited in Europe in the seventeenth century. It died
in England and was presented to Oxford. Nearly a hundred years
latci an ovei-zealous vice-chancellor consigned its moth-eaten remains
to the fire. Only the head and a foot were retrieved from the flames,
and these rather grisly objects may still be seen at the University
Museum, Oxford.
The Dodo was only one of the many birds exterminated in Mauritius
by the destruction of the forests, indiscriminate hunting, and the intro-
duction of the rat, monkey, and mongoose. Some of these extinct birds
make the aviculturist wistful, particularly the Mascarene Parrot
(Mascannus mascann} , which was found in the neighbouring island of
Reunion as late as 1845, and the Broad-billed Mauritius Parrot, a large,
handsome, nocturnal bird, probably flightless, which was sketched by a
Dutch traveller in 1601-1602. Only a few of its bones have been found.
Anothei sti iking bird which would have graced any aviary was the
Dutch Pigeon ( Alectroenas nitidissima) . It had a greyish head, dark blue
body, and russet tail and was last seen in 1850.
But what of the immigrants ? Some of them have fared no better
than the native species. The Painted Quail (Excalfactor ia chinensis ) was
introduced in the first half of the eighteenth century, but the Indian
Mongoose, imported to destroy rats, has practically exterminated it
along with other ground-nesting quail and partridges. Only the Indian
Grey Partridge ( Francolinus pondicerianus) , introduced about 1750, is
holding on piecariously. The Helmet Guinea Fowl ( Numida mitrata ),
introduced in the eighteenth century, is now very rare in the wild state,
though several domesticated races exist. Only two ducks are to be
found in Mauritius, the White-faced Tree Duck ( Dendrocygna viduata),
which may have migrated here from Madagascar, and Meller's Duck
(Anas melleri ), also a Malagasy species. Both are extremely rare.
1 he Red Avadavat (Amandava amandava ) was an early importation
in Mauritius. It was wiped out by the great cyclone of 1892. The same
fate overtook the Cape Canary (Serinus canicollis) which was last seen
in J 9 : 3 - A different fate overtook the Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora ),
which was intioduced from M^alaya about 175(R)* It became such a pest
that an ordinance was passed to encourage its destruction. It was last
seen in 1892. The Grey-headed or Madagascar Lovebird (. Agapornis
cana) was once common in Mauritius, but is now only found in the
small neighbouring island of Rodrigues. Both the Pied Crow ( Corvus
albus) and the Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens ) were introduced
into Mauritius, the latter on several occasions. Both were indis-
criminately shot and are now extinct in the Island. The Madagascar
Broad-billed Roller (Eurystomus glaucurus) , a large, handsome, magenta

bird, occasionally migrates to Mauritius between October and June.
It is nearly always slaughtered on arrival.
Yet some immigrants have managed not only to survive but to
thrive. The absence of cyclones over the past twelve years has per-
mitted the increase of many of the small finches. Both the Spice Finch
and the Waxbill brought to Mauritius in the eighteenth century are
becoming more abundant. The Spot-backed Weaver, known in the
local French patois under the endearing name of " le schlugschlug ", is
increasing so rapidly as to become a pest. The Zebra Dove which
reached Mauritius circa 1781, is well established.
The Mynah was imported about 1760 to control locusts and grass-
hoppers which were devastating crops. It has performed this task well
and " le martin ", as it is called locally, is the most conspicuous bird in
Mauritius. The Ring-necked Parrakeet was brought from India about
1886, and is now considered a destructive pest. The Bulbul is even less
popular because of its attacks on ripening fruit. It was introduced as a
cage bird and accidentally released in 1892.
Possibly the most beautiful Mauritian immigrant is the Madagascar
Fody (Foudia madagascariensis ) which was introduced some time in the
eighteenth century. It is a bird about the size of a canary. The male
in the early summer breeding season is a brilliant scarlet, which gives
rise to the local name " cardinal ". The wings are brownish and there
is a small black diamond shaped mask over each eye. The female is
yellowish-brown. They are fairly common birds though extremely shy.
Much rarer is the Mauritius Fody (Foudia rubra), the ninth endemic
Mauritius bird. Only the head and breast of the male of this species are
scarlet, the rest being greyish-brown. The diamond-shaped eye patches
are much larger than those of the Madagascar species. The female is
brownish-grey.
In spite of the existence of many easily bred species and a nearly
perfect climate, there is little aviculture in Mauritius. In the central
market one can purchase Green Singing Finches, Waxbills, Spice
Finches, Ring-necked Parrakeets, and Zebra and Necklace Doves ;
some degenerate Budgerigars are also offered. Most of these birds are
kept as cage birds or in decorative aviaries in gardens. Little attempt
is made to breed them. It seems a great pity that no efforts are made to
breed some of the rarer endemic birds which, I fear, will disappear all
too soon from this lovely Island.

Aviculturists frequently have opportunities to add to our knowledge
of many kinds of birds, but because their first interest is properly one of
keeping and breeding their birds, rather than looking for new data,
they sometimes fail to record detailed observations which would be of
use to other students of birds. The purpose of this short paper is to call
attention to the need for fuller information on the Whydahs of the
genera Vidua and Steganura and the related Combassous or Indigo
Finches.
These birds, either known to be parasitic in their breeding or
suspected of being so, are frequently kept in aviaries, which gives the
aviculturist the opportunity to add important information of a sort
that would be extremely difficult to obtain in field studies of wild birds.
Parasitic birds have been a special study of mine for many years and at
present I am preparing a comprehensive report on these weavers.
Bringing together all the available information, both published and
unpublished, has revealed the many and serious gaps in our knowledge
of them, and I would urge all aviculturists having any of these birds to
keep careful records of any observations on the courtship and breeding
habits they may display. I shall be glad to correspond with anyone
having notes on them, and hope that by combining many individual
notes and experiences there may result an account more useful to, and
more meaningful for, all parties concerned.
1 nee d for further knowledge may be made clearer by appending
here a series of particular questions to which it is hoped that some
answers may be forthcoming from observations on these birds in
captivity. First of all a list of the species involved may be helpful.
They are as follows:--

FIRST BREEDING OF THE GREATER HILL
MYNAH (EU.LABES RELIGIOSA ) AT THE
KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994795" page_id="58073384"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
A pair of Greater Hill Mynahs have successfully reared a young
one here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm this (1957) season, and in
reply to a letter of mine, Mr. Prestwich wrote saying they have
" certainly never been bred before ".
The parents are a most amusing and quite celebrated couple as they
appealed on television in September, 195^3 when an hour's programme
was devoted to our Bird Farm.
\\ e impor ted a number of hand-reared Greater Hill Mynahs from
India in 1955 and kept one specially tame cock whom we called Joe.
He was given an aviary to himself and the following year was provided
with a mate who more or less christened herself Jo-Jo. Incidentally,
although they are superficially as alike as two peas, it is possible to
sex these Mynahs by the colours of the eyes and legs. As is the case
with many of the cockatoos, the cock's eye has an almost black iris,
while that of the hen is of a brownish colour, and her legs are of a paler
yellow than his, as also are her wattles.
Our pair both emit terrific wolf whistles and this is apt to have a
lathei disconcerting effect on our female customers, causing them to
glance hurriedly round to see which male member of our staff has
taken a fancy to them ! They also whistle " Pop goes the Weasel ",
Joe doing the first part, and Jo-Jo finishing it for him with an extra
loud POP . ... goes the Weasel Joe gives the most accurate and
reverberating imitation of the ringing of a bell--a sound which I
should have thought was extraordinarily difficult for a bird to re-
produce. They also do a rather fruity laugh and a very wheezy
asthmatical cough, and are excellent talkers with a very clear enuncia-
tion, among their sayings being : " Hullo Joe," " How are you

aviary by himself. They are both, particularly Jo-Jo, very devoted to
our General Manager, Bill Cummings--as they ought to be, considering
the care he bestows upon them.
Being by nature more or less omnivorous they were always given a
varied diet, particularly when they were rearing their young one, at
which time they were given bread and milk, insectivorous mixture,
apples, pears, cherries, grapes, etc. : minced raw meat, chopped
dates, and, morning and evening, a rationed allowance of gentles and
mealworms. Once--a rather anxious moment--they were given a
skinned mouse and I had qualms lest it should be too much, in one go,
for the young one. However, my fears proved groundless, for Jo-Jo
took it in her beak with its hind legs flapping about outside, and after
doing some rather muffled talking owing to this obstruction, dis-
appeared into the nest-box and fed it to the young one, who was none
the worse, and, incidentally, was always very noisy when being fed.
Two days before the young one fledged a most extraordinary thing
happened. Jo-Jo suddenly decided to murder Joe, and had not my
partner Alec Brooksbank happened to pass their aviary at the crucial
moment and succeeded in rescuing poor Joe, she would certainly have
succeeded. Although the stronger bird of the two, he was in a state of
abject terror and she had got him on the ground in the corner of the
flight and was starting to hammer away at his head.
Always hitherto a most devoted couple, they had been together in
the same aviary for about eighteen months, and I can think of no
explanation at all of why she should have so suddenly and viciously
attacked him. In any case a very disconsolate Joe was removed from
the aviary and the following day the young one perched for some time
in the entrance to the nest-box and then went back inside again. The
next day it came right out and flew straight down and had a bath ! It
was very steady and, although a strong flier, never did any of the usual
banging about in the aviary, and I only wish all newly-fledged birds
were as self-possessed and sensible.
Actually, if there was to be any trouble between the parents, we
originally thought it would be that Joe might attack Jo-Jo, because he
was extremely possessive about their only child, and in the early stages
did practically all the feeding of it. Incidentally, I may add that the
young Mynah is now fully independent and has been taken away from
its mother. We naturally wondered what sort of reception Joe would
get when he returned to the aviary, but apart from Jo-Jo calling him
a silly old crow several times and both of them doing a good deal of
whistling, there was very little reaction on either side. The following
morning, however, Joe was found dashing about in the aviary and
panting with exhaustion, so, although she did not appear to be doing

so at the time, we could only conclude that Jo-Jo had been chasing hin
about. Rather regretfully therefore, we decided that the only thins
to do was to clip one of her wings so that Joe could always easily ge
away from her. The curious thing is that judging by their demeanou
whenever one is watching them, one would still imagine that they ar
at all times the very best of friends.
Last year the parents went to nest twice, on each occasion breaking
their very beautiful, faintly speckled bright blue eggs, but this may hav
been because their nest had no coconut husk fixed in the bottom, as i
had this year. It is true that, from the nesting material supplied, the)
selected numerous twigs and coarse grass stalks which they depositee
in the box, but they did not make a proper nest, and this I think wa
the cause of the broken eggs. When nesting, they have a curious habi
of periodically carrying quite large stones into the nest-box, and thes
had to be removed from time to time.
As will be seen from the accompanying photographs which wer
taken by my partner Alec Brooksbank the day after the young one lei
the nest, it was at first smaller than its mother, and, of course, lacke(
the high gloss on the black plumage of an adult. Its legs were very pal
whitish-yellow, as were the rudimentary wattles which consisted c
small, flat patches of bare skin.
As described above Edward J. Boosey has bred the Greater Hi]
Mynah (Eulabes religiosa). It is believed that this may be a first success
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this specie
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate a
once with the Hon. Secretary.

gradually brought up again to its pre-war standard. The Paigntoi

has resulted in a number of rare and interesting birds and mammal

)ne compartment with a small pool was being prepared for a Surinam
acana ( Jacana spinosa) which the Zoo has had for some time.
The Parrot house, with its cages of unusual and very practical
[esign, still contains some of Mr. Whitley's old inmates, such as a
Hue-eyed Cockatoo and a Green-winged King Parrakeet. There is
good series of Amazon Parrots, including the Yellow-headed,
dealy, Red-throated, Salvin's, Salle's, and Orange-winged. The
]onures also are well represented with the Brown-throated, Finsch's,
he Greater Patagonian, and Golden-crowned. There are specimens
f the Orange-crowned Gold Coast Parrot ( Poicephalus gulielmi
antiensis ), and of Maximilian's Parrot. In this house were also a pair
f Abyssinian Touracos and a pair of Double-toothed Barbets
Lybius bidentatus) brought from Africa by Mr. Michelmore, the head
f the Whitley Educational Trust.
Extensive repairs and renovations have been carried out to many
f the houses and ranges of aviaries, and these are now populated by a
hoice selection of birds, which were shown to me by the Curator,
dr. Travers. A great deal of thought is given to the care and comfort
nd feeding of the birds, and the result is obvious in their beautiful
ondition.
A range of about eight tropical aviaries has a good selection of
inches, doves, and softbills, and Tinamous of two interesting species.
)ne compartment contains four specimens of the Little Blue Heron
Florida caerulea) in its immature white form, another one a pair of
dount Roraima Aracaris ( Pteroglossus roraimae), brought back by the
*ritish Guiana expedition, and thought to be a first importation.
There is a long range of outdoor aviaries, with shelters which can be
eattd when necessary, containing a series of macaws and cockatoos,
mother range with very large flights has Occipital Blue Pies, breeding
early, and a small collection of pheasants.
The birds of prey range houses among other Raptores a pair of
'ondors which must have been there for thirty years, the hen laying
early. Owls are also well represented.
Beautiful paddocks on the hillside contain Sarus, Stanley, Demoiselle,
nd White-necked Cranes ; Cereopsis Geese bred last winter, and
arnacles were nesting at the time of my visit.
Perhaps the pride of the whole collection are two Wattled Cranes,
reived separately from Africa, the later arrival a young bird. It is
reatly to be hoped that they may prove to be a pair.
A small pond enclosure has Rosy Wood Ibises, Sacred Ibises,
nd Tree Ducks, and another one Black-necked Storks and Pelicans,
lack-footed Penguins had bred in this shelter.

The Zoo authorities have ambitious schemes in view for the develop
ment of a beautiful, wooded valley beyond the lake, with hillsid
paddocks and rocky quarries for a series of large birds and mammals
and of groupings of plants in their natural orders. This would certainl
be a unique addition, though even to-day a visit of two or three day
is not too much to devote to this Zoo.

Among the recent arrivals at New Grounds the most importar
addition to the collection has been a fine consignment of birds mad
available by the courtesy of the Department for Internal Affairs c
New Zealand. This consignment included three pairs of New Zealan
Brown Duck [Anas aucklandica chlorotis), three pairs of Blue or Mountai
Duck ( Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos) --a species which we understand ha
never before been kept in captivity, and two pairs of New Zealan
Scaup (. Aythya nova-seelandice) . These birds have now finished the]
quarantine and are well established in our pens.
The arrival of two male Kelp Geese ( Chloephaga hybrida hybride
from the Falkland Islands means that all species of geese are now n
presented in the Wildfowl Trust collection. These were accompanie
by two pairs of Flightless Steamer Duck ( Tachyeres brachypterus ).
After many years we have at last succeeded in obtaining and estal
lishing a Bufflehead ( Bucephala albeola) at Slimbridge. A pair was sei

The female was force-fed on small sections of eel for some days and

Common Scoter ( Melanitta nigra nigra) have also been established fc
the first time, and a further addition has been a fine pair of Hoode
Merganser ( Mergus cucullatus ) reared and presented to us by Mr. Pillin
of Seattle.

Though the distribution of this bird covers an enormous area, from
;he West Coast of Ireland and the Iberian Peninsula, through Southern
Europe and North Africa (a colony inhabiting one of the smaller
Canary Isles), the mountain ranges of the Mediterranean, Syria,
\byssinia, Arabia, Southern Russia, Afghanistan, Central Asia,
Trough the Himalayas to North-East China, its habitats are more or
ess remote localities required by the birds' specialized economy.
These are high cliff faces often rising sheer out of the sea or high
altitudes on great mountain ranges, usually in the most lonely and
desolate places of the world. Mountaineers have said that the Chough
is the last avian inhabitant of the great peaks seen before reaching the
utterly barren regions of snow and ice which will not support feathered
ur in fact any other kind of life.
The following is taken from a recent book, The Sherpa and the Snow-
man , by Charles Stonor, page 104 :--
" Choughs were much in evidence to-day, and the two kinds found
in the Himalayas were both the Red-billed (Tchong-moh to the
Sherpas) and the Yellow-billed (or Tchong-Dzum) clever, happy
birds, very characteristic of the Sherpa countryside, much as are the
rooks amongst ourselves. The climbing expeditions meet them right
up at 26,000 feet and even higher, though what takes them to altitudes
that are totally devoid of life, it is hard to imagine.
I had met them several times already, bustling about in the village
fields, prodding in the ground with their long scimitar beaks, and
streaming down the valleys in loose flocks on their way to their feeding
grounds and back. Both kinds go together in casual association, but
their habits are different, the red-billed do not find their way up so
high, or in such large flocks, and they have a jackdaw-like call, as
compared with the eerie banshee piping of their relative. And again,
from the same source :--
" My attention was called to a vast flock of yellow-billed choughs

swarming overhead, a thousand or more strong ; they were engaged
in some spring courtship flight, spread out when we first saw them in
a great dark cloud, like a drifting plume of smoke or a swarm ol
gigantic bees. Each and every bird of the flock, wing quills spreac
apart, was dipping and diving, planing and weaving, in and out o.
the cloud of its fellows, now solitary, now a member of a little group
broken away and displaying as a unit. The whole assemblage was
sometimes a continuous flock, sometimes splitting up into parties
swarming together to reunite as a rounded whole or to straggle out
streamer-wise. Surely this must be one of the most wonderful spring
flights among birds. Even the hard-bitten Sherpas were impressec
and stopped to watch as the choughs began to spiral in wide circles,
until they soared away in silence, out of sight of the naked eye, at
height of anything between twenty-five and thirty thousand feet.
It has become a common experience of mountaineering expeditions
in the Himalayas to meet choughs and other birds at immense
altitudes. Apparently the lack of oxygen and the conditions of the
atmosphere has no effect on them at all ; an extraordinary condition
of affairs for which the science of physiology does not so far give an
explanation.
To the ordinary outsider it suggests a remarkable body mechanism,
whereby a quick-moving creature such as a bird, all of whose vita
processes must act with such infinitely greater speed than our own,
can climb to the thinnest atmosphere, where we can hardly scrape
along with artificial helps, and in a matter of seconds adjust its every
movement to a totally different set of outside stresses and strains."
Yet strange to say the Chough is equally at home down at sea-
level on the stony beaches at the base of the cliffs in the few places
where it survives in the British Isles.
It is in the mountainous regions and on the cliff faces that one sees
how useful is the long, slender down-curving bill which, with the legs
and feet, look as if they had been cut out of coral, for not only do they
look like red coral, but they have the feel and texture of that substance.
The bill is quite different from that of any other member of the Crow
family, except that of its near relative the Yellow-billed Chough, though
with this bird it is shorter and less curved. Neither does any member
of the Crow tribe use his beak with such facility. The Chough can
use it to work round corners or under rocky ledges, for prying under
flat stones, exploring fissures and crevices, seeking out insects which
are forced to hide away from the bitter winds which so often blow at
hurricane force in those high regions.
In those lofty realms where our bird makes his home there is great
competition in the plant world for an adequate anchorage, so there is
little loose or free soil. It is matted and turfy and held together by the
roots of rock plants. It is here that the Chough uses his beak as a

pickaxe to hack into these masses for insects or their pupae, which in
the cold altitudes, lie torpid for long periods.
I have watched the birds digging out tiny pockets of earth on cliff
faces which contained the nests of minute ants and unearthing ground
spiders which seem common in high places, it's then that the beak
is used as forceps or tweezers to pick out the edible bits in the debris.
In fact the Chough seems to spend his time either probing, exploring,
and excavating the stony world in which he lives in his never-ending
search for food--or in aerial acrobatics. Though there may be swifter
fliers, such as the dashing and meteor-like Peregrine or the speeding
Alpine Swift, scything its way with incredible speed through the high
atmosphere, and which must be the fastest flyer of all birds, few,
if any, have the effortless and graceful flight of the Chough.
It seems not so much to use its power of flight to get from one place
to another, as for the sheer joy of flight alone, and incongruous as
it may sound when speaking of a crow, its flight has the lightness of
thistledown borne on the wind. Its displays of aerial prowess are
enhanced by the settings in which they are given, which are in the
most spectacular, majestic, awe-inspiring, and least frequented by
man, of all the world's most solitary and lonely places.
Once common around the high cliff faces of our Southern and
Western shores, the Chough has now, alas, been reduced to the
status of one of our rarest breeding birds, colony after colony vanishing
during the last 150 years. Its near extermination has been brought
about by two main agencies, by the egg collectors who have almost
every accessible nest marked down and who receive word from the
local inhabitants when the eggs are ready for taking. I he second
reason for its rapid decline is shooting, firstly by scientific skin
collectors in the nineteenth century and by that fraternity who found
pleasure, and still do, in massacring our wild birds. In the last century
sea-bird shooting was one of the favourite recognized " sports " for
holiday makers, and guns and boats could be hired on the spot.
In Cornwall and Wales the birds' habit of digging has been its
undoing. Farmers with cliff-land farms have seen the birds probing
about in the newly-sown wheat or oat patches on the top of the
cliffs and refusing to believe that the birds were not after the freshly
planted seed were glad of an excuse to slaughter them. The belief
that the birds eat grain is very prevalent in Cornwall, where a few
pairs of Choughs still linger.
Considering that the Red-billed, or Cornish Chough, as it used
to be called in these Islands, is such an outstanding member of the
Crow tribe and that it is so well known in folklore and tradition
Shakespeare speaks of " the russet-pated Chough "--it is very
surprising how very little has been written about it in avicultural
literature.

In all the years of keeping birds I have never seen or heard of but
one offered for sale and that was at a fantastic price. Yet they are;
sure to be seen at any of the larger bird shows in this country where
the owner can be certain of getting a " First " in the " Large British
Softbill " class. In fact at a leading show in recent years I heard that
nine had been entered for competition !
I had kept the other species, the Alpine or Yellow-billed, but gave
them away to a local public aviary before embarking on a long voyage
abroad. I was rather sorry about this afterwards, for the birds turned
out to be a true pair and nested every year and hatched young,
but failed to rear them as they were not supplied with suitable
food.
However, within recent years a pair were known to be on sale,
and it was more or less to save their lives that I bought them. When
I got them home they certainly looked a " poor buy Owing to
unsuitable food which lacked the necessary vitamins, there were
large areas of the plumage which lacked pigment, being a dirty putty
colour instead of the normal glossy purple-black. The naturally
brilliant coral-coloured beaks and legs were pale and dull, especially
in the male bird, whose bill was overgrown and who had a nasty
chesty cough. The hen's beak was badly crossed which made it
difficult for her to feed.
On being put into a large aviary with rocks and gravel, a large
bath, plenty of room to fly about and a shed (which they loved),
their joy knew no bounds. For the first few weeks they spent their
time alternately bathing and whetting their beaks on the flat stones
in order to get them into the proper shape again.
The discovery of the opening which leads into the shed was the
source of great interest to the birds. At first they discussed the matter
on the ground, then flew on to the bottom ledge of the opening,
craning their necks inside so far that they nearly fell over, all the
while conversing with each other. Sometimes the cock would push
the hen in and she seemingly terrified would rush out and then try
to push the cock in. This went on for a day or more and when at
last they decided it held no terrors for them, they simply loved it,
mainly I think because out of a window they could see if any one
approached from the house. Tamer or more charming birds I never
had. They are quite without fear.
I he Chough from all accounts is a bird with a happy disposition ;
though most birds of the Crow family are quick-witted (they have
to be to survive), intelligent and cunning, some have a sense of
humour--but this bird is quite different, it seems to dance its way
through life, always happy, light and airy, full of grace and gaiety.
It is interested in what one does, but the interest shown does not give
the impression of noseyness. There is always a joyous welcome when

jne comes in sight, though they often remain silent when a stranger
appears.
In the spring of 1956 the birds went to nest in half of a large
barrel which had been cut in two and placed end up on a platform
near the top of the aviary. A large hole had been cut in the side of
the barrel and the whole simulated a small cave. This was taken
to with alacrity. Soon the birds had a large structure built in the
centre of which was a small depression about the size of an ordinary
Blackbird's nest, and in time five eggs were laid. These were duly
incubated but, alas, failed to hatch, as they proved to be infertile.
This was no doubt owing to the low condition of the birds which
had been looked after during my prolonged illness by someone who,
though professing to be an ardent aviculturist, had neglected the bilds,
and finally let me down altogether, until my kind friend Fred Logan
stepped into the breach.
During this nesting period the cock became extremely aggressive,
in fact he has never lost his pugnacity. He had a specialized and
cunning method of attack. As soon as he felt one s eyes were not on
him, he made lightning dashes for one's head, which he attacked
with his feet, inflicting quite nasty abrasions.
The attempt at reproduction seemed to give him added confidence
and he became very aggressive towards humans he knew, though I
could never decide if this was really pure bad temper or just very
aggressive and boisterous play. When he got himself worked up he
would crouch on the ground, feet well apart, feathers standing on end,
head between his legs and wings alternately waving in a kind of
rowing motion. His attacks on humans greatly annoyed the hen, who
would take a flying shot at him and knock him on to the ground,
where the pair, a tangled ball of feathered fury, would fight it out.
In a few minutes after this was over they would be their own friendly
selves towards each other.
Bathing they love, and if by accident they have been closed in theii
shed for a period of several hours, they both indulge in iepeated
bathing which lasts for an hour or so.
They live mainly on a good insectivorous mixture with as much
live food as possible. Unlike other members of the Crow family the\ r
refuse any type of vegetable food, even cheese in bulk they disdain,
though I use it, finely grated, in their food. Nearly all
insectivorous birds like cheese, especially Jays and theii kindled.
As mentioned before, in a wild state Choughs feed to a great extent
on the contents of the nests of small species of ants, but my birds when
given uncleaned " ant eggs in bulk with nest debris and living ants,
were simply terrified and have always remained so, keeping as fai
as possible from the container. They are very fond of mealwoims
and woodlice.

The Choughs live amicably with a pair of Blue Crossoptilons,
though perhaps " amicably " is hardly the right word . . . " armed
truce " would perhaps be better. I am sure they would be unsafe with
any other birds, either their own size or smaller. The Crossoptilons live
in a state of haughty disdain, ignoring the Choughs, as far as possible
until the lattei tweak their long flowing tails. However, with young
Crossoptilons it's quite a different matter. These are chased and
chivvied and generally tormented until they hide away and would
rather starve than come out of their hiding place.
Many so-called sub-species of the Red-billed Chough exist in the
imagination of scientific ornithologists, five being recognized in the
U.S.S.R. alone, the differences being usually in the length of the
third primaries, the central tail-feathers, or the legs ; these being
only a question of millimetres. But to casual observers the whole genus
appears to be more or less uniform.

Gabon, has sent two Cameroon Spotted Honey-Guides {Indicator
maculatus stictithorax ), the first of the Indicatoridae to be received here
This race, like most of the Honey-Guides, is not brightly coloured,
rather resembling a very small and dull coloured hen Satin Bower
Biid in general pattern, but for a variety of reasons the family is of
great interest.
The Honey-Guides are a small family (eleven species according to
Friedmann; thirteen according to Peters) of four genera and all
inhabit Africa with the exception of the Orange-rumped of the
Himalayas and a race of it ranging from northern Assam to northern
Burma, and the Malayan Honey-Guide of Siam, the Malay peninsula,
Sumatra and some adjacent islands.
The habit of guiding ratels (honey badgers) and human beings to
bees' nests is known to occur in the Greater Honey-Guide and the
Variegated or Scaly-throated. The guiding call of the former is a
chattering noise. This appears to be the best known of the family and
has a wide range over Africa southward of the Sahara wherever the
habitat is suitable.
The birds appear not so much interested in honey as in the comb and
larvae of bees which, of course, they could not obtain unaided, and it is
only after the ratel or man has taken the bees' nest that the bird
(almost always alone, but occasionally there are two) comes to feed
on the remaining fragments. Bees and other insect life are also eaten.
The Greater Honey-Guide is, according to Friedmann, known to be

brood-parasitic on thirty-five different bird species including Barbets,
Woodpeckers, Kingfishers, Bee-eaters, Wood Hoopoes, Hoopoes,
Thrushes, Starlings, Weavers, Swallows, Ant-eater Chats and Sparrows.
All known eggs are white.
The young of at least some Honey-Guides are furnished with a sharp
hook on both upper and lower mandibles, these hooks dropping off
after some days. Whether the hooks are employed in the killing or
ejection of the foster parents' young is not known. It would surely be
very difficult in the case of some hole-nesting foster parents for the
Honey-Guide chick to evict the others, but whatever the method, and
there is evidence of both, the Honey-Guide is eventually the sole
survivor of the brood.
The Greater, Lesser, and Lyre-tailed perform flights in which a
noise is made, presumably by the outer tail-feathers, when the bird
dives. The skin of these birds is said to be very tough--evidently a
protection against the stings of bees.
Since the foster parents never eat honeycomb, the young Honey-
Guide cannot feed on it until it is able to fend for itself, when, presum-
ably, it learns by watching the adults. Why there should be this
desire for bees' wax and how it is digested ; how the guiding process
was evolved and how ratels and native people could originally have
learned that it was advantageous to follow a chattering bird are among
the many problems concerning these strange birds investigated by Dr.
Herbert Friedmann, but although a great deal of information about
them is set forth in his work, " The Honey-Guides " (United States
National Museum Bulletin 208), much remains to be discovered. m
Honey-Guides have been kept in captivity. Mr. Sydney Porter wrote
of an immature Greater Honey-Guide that he rescued and kept in
Southern Rhodesia (A.M. 1927, p. 152) which he referred to as the
Yellow-throated, but he was not alone in making this mistake, for the
young of this species is so different in plumage from either parent that
for a long time it was considered another species. Friedmann says, A
South African aviculturist, W. R. Carthew, informs me that he has
kept both greater and lesser honey-guides for over a year. . . .
Other birds new to the Collection are a pair of the Malayan Bustard-
Quail [Turnix suscitator atrogularis) presented by Mr. G. H. Newmark,
who also sent an Orange-headed Ground Thrush and a Black Racquet-
tailed Magpie ; and an Eastern Waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus central -
asiae) presented, together with a pair of Crested Black Buntings, a
Fohkien Grey-headed Crow-Tit and a Grey Starling, by Dr. K. G.
Searle. Messrs. Brooke Bond have given two Baillon's Aracaris and
two Purple-crested Touracos ; three Common, three Ring-necked, and
two Mongolian Pheasants have been received in exchange.
The Bustard-Quail are not, of course, Quail, but are of the same
Order as the Bustards, Cranes, Rails, Kagu, etc. The females are

larger and more boldly coloured than the males and are said to be
very pugnacious during the breeding season. The males incubate
the eggs and care for the young. Members of this family are also known
as Button Quail or Hemipodes, and the Andalusian (T. sylvatica ) oi
north-western Africa and the southern parts of Spain and Portugal has
on three occasions been found in England, but these were generally
regarded as escaped birds, though, as Newton says, " easily satisfied
persons have admitted the species as a ' British Bird
The Eastern Waxwing is much like the more westerly bird, but a
little paler and greyer.
Three Snowy Owls, the first to be bred in the Gardens, have been
reared, two by a pair of Spotted Eagle-Owls and one by the parents
which have nested each year for several years, but have not previously
kept the chicks alive for more than a day or two. The Malayan Glossy
Starlings sent by Dr. Searle several years ago have reared two young,
one in each nest. This starling was bred in 1931 by Mr. A. H. Isenberg
in California (A.M. 1931, p. 23), but has not, so far as I know, ever
before been bred in this country. The young are quite unlike either
parent, being grey on the upper parts and whitish streaked with dark
grey underneath--rather like a female Amethyst Starling. The nests
were built in a crevice of the rockwork.
The Black-throated Cardinals have built five nests and hatched a few
young ones, but have not yet succeeded in rearing any. The old
breeding pair of Green-winged King Parrakeets have bred only one
this year ; four Quaker Parrakeets, yet another Swainson's X Red-
collared Lorikeet, Cockatiels, Masked Lovebirds, another Green-
backed X Grey-headed Gallinule and some Pheasants have also been
bred. A pair of Sarus Cranes nested but did not hatch their two eggs.
One King Penguin chick has been hatched and a second pair are
still incubating an egg.
A North American White-headed (or Bald) Eagle has died after
nineteen years in the Gardens. The oldest inhabitant among the birds
of prey is a Bateleur Eagle that came in 1919.
The White-necked Picathartes sent from Sierra Leone four months
ago has died from tuberculosis, a disease which it may have contracted
in Africa, for Blount states that, in domestic fowls, " Except in those
rare instances where the infection is passed via the egg to the chick, the
natural incubation period is long, never less than five months."
Whether the incubation period is the same in smaller birds is not known,
but the disease is generally associated with aged birds.
Looking through the 1927 volume of the Magazine I noticed an
article by Miss Knobel describing a visit to Mr. Spedan Lewis' collec-
tion of owls at Wargrave. Mention was made of a tame Turkestan
Eagle-Owl, a bird which came here in 1950 and which until this year
has laid and incubated a single egg each summer.

In 1936 the Edinburgh Zoo received six Night Herons from Canada.
They reared several broods in an aviary and in 1950 some of the
young birds were released. They did not leave the Park and built
nests in the trees surrounding the Sea Lions' Pool. Now about thirty
of these birds form a free colony, nesting regularly.

Allen Silver continues to breed Golden-mantled Rosellas and
Stanleys with considerable success--please note, none for sale ! The
Rosellas, now somewhat aged, have reared a brood of three (the
smallest number any of the three hens used over the years has reared).
This now makes 72 young reared in the same aviary and box, since
the first pair was obtained from Tom Goodwin many years ago.
The Stanleys reared four in 1955, six in 19565 an -d five this year ;
and a 1955 female paired to an adult Australian male has at first

AUDUBON WESTERN BIRD GUIDE. By Richard H.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.858036380952381" page_id="58073404"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Published by Doubleday and Company, New York, 1957
4 dollars 95 cents.
This is a companion to Mr. Pough's two previous books --Audubon
Bird Guide which covers small land birds of Eastern and Central
North America from Southern Texas to Central Greenland, and
Audubon Water Bird Guide which comprises water, game, and large land
birds of the same areas. The present volume comprises land, water,
and game birds of Western North America, including Alaska, from
Mexico to Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean. Of the 614 species
included in the book, 203 are exclusively western, and these are
described fully with information concerning nests, habits, and range.
For the other 411 the range only is given as they have already been
described by the author in his books on eastern birds, and the page
references of these are given. There are 340 drawings in colour by
Don Eckelberry, some species are shown in flight, for others the com-
parison of mature and immature birds, plumage at different seasons,
or male and female are given. There are also a large number of line
drawings by Terry M. Shortt, mostly of birds in flight. The informa-
tion is clearly and concisely given and the book is a worthy addition
to the author's previous bird guides.

AN INTRODUCTION TO BIRDKEEPING. By D. H. S. Risdon.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9696195" page_id="58073404"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Published by Cage Birds , London, 1957. Price 15J. net.
Mr. Risdon's first words in his general introduction are : " This
book is for the beginner in birdkeeping. It is not for the more
experienced aviculturist." A very good book indeed it is for those who
are starting to keep birds, but it also contains much of interest and use
to those who are more experienced. For one thing, the author explains
clearly the difference between " species " and " variety "--a confusion
between the two terms is surprisingly frequently made. The birds
which are possessed by those who read Mr. Risdon's book should be
happier birds, for all through he stresses the importance of watching
them closely and so ensuring their health and well-being. He points
out what to look out for and what to do about it, and his book contains
many details not to be found in other publications on the subject.

A possible Explanation of Failures in Rearing Superb Spreos
I am having trouble with my brood of Superb Spreos and looking through the
past records it seems that very often the birds give up feeding the young just before
they fledge. This is just what has happened with mine and I am wondering if my
findings might be an explanation of the cause of other peoples' trouble.
The females laid in the one nest a total of seven eggs, six of which hatched. All
four birds in the aviary fed the young devotedly and paid no attention to my man,
even taking mealworms from his fingers and flying directly with them into the nest.
They did not seem to resent my examining the nest daily and this daily examination
revealed a dead young one when they were about fifteen days old. It was plump and
well-fed looking and had I not been post-mortem minded I might have just thought
that it had died of chilling, or something, for the old birds had already cut down on
the feeding. I opened it and found that its trachea was just about full of gapeworms ;
I counted over thirty couples. The old birds had now given up feeding altogether
and next day I brought the remaining four into the house (one had disappeared).
To my mind the parents had given up feeding because the young were too sick to
gape for food and not because of any interference on my part, for this had been
going on all the time.
Two of the young cnes were very sick and gasped continuously. None gaped for
food and it was a matter of prizing open the bill and force-feeding all the time.
In any case they were too old to gape for a human foster-parent. By the second day
one young one refused to swallow the food put into its pharynx and died the next
day. One of the others has a broken femur and unfortunately this one seems to
be the most likely to survive. One of the others has wilted a bit, but I do hope I
can save at least some.
They share a big planted aviary, 80 feet by 30 feet, with a pair of Green Peafowl,
and although it has only been in use for one year, it must be pretty well infected.
I intend to disinfect it by killing off the earthworms with Mowrah meal and reduce
the risk of gapes and of blackhead in the peafowl. Tom Spence.

BREEDING BLUE ROBINS--A PLAGUE OF FOXES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992784761904762" page_id="58073405"  page_num="177" year="" vol="">
The hen of a pair of Blue Robins kept in a cage which had made a nest and laid
eggs, refused to tolerate the cock after four days, so I removed him to save his life.
The hen then incubated and reared four excellent young, two cocks and two hens,
which are now independent ; she is rebuilding the nest. In the meantime the
cock has been paired to another hen in an aviary and has five more youngsters by
her. Unfortunately this second hen still seems to want him to help with the domestic
duties and I hesitate to borrow him either to return to hen No. 1 or to a third hen
which has also built in a cage and is calling for a cock all day. A fourth hen, also
in a cage, and paired to her brother, has eggs, but does not appear to be sitting ;
maybe she is shy and comes off the nest when I am about.
We have a plague of foxes here this year which have pretty well wiped out domestic
poultry in the neighbourhood and are also destroying cats--bless them ! Unfortu-
nately they are causing me some anxiety by digging at the foundations of my pigeon
lofts and aviaries and must go the way of all flesh. One got itself shut up in the
garage, where at the risk of blowing the tyres off the cars, I shot it. One morning
when I went out to supply breakfast to the baby Robins (5 a.m.) I met a young dog
fox ambling down the front path. When he saw me, he merely turned aside and
strolled down another path, which has taught me never to go out in the morning
without a gun. As we are in a very much " built-up " area, I suppose the lack of
rabbits is driving the foxes into the vicinity of human habitation, in search of other
forms of food. K. A. Norris.

THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY'S WATERFOWL RINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9870058" page_id="58073406"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
Members sometimes ask to be told the size of the Society's rings required for
" the various " ducks and geese, and while the table published from time to time in
the Magazine is a good general guide, it is clearly impracticable to include all the I
species in it--even if anyone is able and willing to measure a number of tarsi of each
of " the various " waterfowl.
Keepers of waterfowl should judge for themselves the requisite sizes, and a simple
rule is that the ring must move freely up and down the tarsus, but must not be so
large as to slip easily off the foot. It should not, of course, fit tightly.
A number of Mallard rings are received from time to time, but I cannot under-
stand why anyone should want to put the Avicultural Society's rings on these or on
any other common native species. The scheme is surely intended for members and
others wishing to keep foreign or the rarer native waterfowl full-winged so that if,
for an unlikely instance, a stray Barrow's Golden-eye is found and it is wearing one
of the Society's rings, it will be proved not to be a new bird for the British List, and
ornithologists will be spared a certain amount of doubt, not to say grief.

DUFRESNE'S WAXBILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9497195" page_id="58073413"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
(&apos;Coccopygia melanotis melanotis)
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
Dufresne's Waxbill, also known as the Yellow-bellied Waxbill and,
in South Africa, as the Swee Waxbill was first described in 1817 by
Vieillot who named it Fringilla dufresni, but the description was
considered by Sclater to be inapplicable because of being so faulty,
and Temminck ( PL Col., livr. xxxvi, 1833, pi. 221, fig. 1) is now the
accepted author.
This Waxbill inhabits south-eastern Africa, being said by Stark to
be migratory in part of its range, but resident in Natal and the
Transvaal.
Sclater recognized five races, the Angola Yellow-bellied Waxbill
(C. m. bocagei), the Kenya (C. m. kilimensis), the Uganda (C. m. nyanzae ),
and the Abyssinian (C. m. quartina ) being the others.
Stark says, " In Natal this pretty little species is, when not breeding,
usually met with in small parties of ten or twelve, feeding on the
ground on grass-seeds. . . . This Waxbill breeds in Natal not un-
commonly, but not, so far as I have observed, near the coast. Not far
from Howick, at a height of about 3,000 feet, I have met with their
nests in some numbers. Unlike many of the Waxbills, they build in
tall bushes and young trees, at a height of from six to ten feet. The
nests are rough-looking, oval structures, with an entrance hole on one
side, constructed of fine dry grass. The flowering ends of the grass
being woven together, the stiff stalks are left projecting in all directions.
The interior is lined with grass tops, down, and feathers. The eggs
are very small, pure white in colour, and four or five in number.
When first hatched the young are fed on small caterpillars."
Dufresne's Waxbill was first bred in the British Isles by Miss Elsie
Robinson, who wrote a good account of the occurrence for the
Avicultural Magazine (1934, p. 249) and was awarded the Society's
medal. Mr. H. S. Sewell bred it in Adelaide during the following

By E. H. Hawke (Lourengo Marques, Portuguese East Africa)
Although I appreciate all too well how boring accounts of breeding
this and that can become, it does occur to me that some of the successes;
(and failures) in this part of the world, where, I think I am right in
saying I am the only member, and which is probably not well known
to many of your readers, might be of interest.
Lourengo Marques, the capital of Portuguese East Africa, is situated
on the mainland some 250 miles (as the crow flies) north of Durban.
It enjoys one of the finest climates of the world during four months of
the year (May-August) ; is very pleasant during another four (March-
April and September-October), but from November-February, it is
not to be recommended. Our rains fall during the summer months
except for odd showers and when it rains, it rains. Aviary drainage and
shelters therefore need careful watching, otherwise there is a risk of
finding oneself with accommodation more suited to fish than birds.
In all I have at the moment twenty-four aviaries, with another five
about to be constructed. Four of these are planted, the largest
measuring 15 feet by 45 feet by 18 feet. The rest, including those to be
constructed, are in the main, breeding cages. They vary slightly in
dimensions and shape, but roughly are in units measuring 4 feet by
8 feet by 12 feet, which can be combined if required to form larger
areas.
From both the ornithologists' and aviculturists' point of view,
Portuguese East Africa is an area which delights both the heart and
the eye. Still, in many districts, comparatively unspoiled by the
advent of man, there are some 900 different species of birds ranging
from the lordly Ostrich down to the tiniest of the warblers, in greater
or lesser profusion, and no matter where you may roam, it will be a
rare exception if no bird is in view.
One would think that with such a wealth of bird life close at hand,
no one in their sane senses would look beyond our boundaries for
aviary stock, but what aviculturist is sane ? Naturally my collection,
which now comprises some 100 species and 500 birds, is made up
mainly of locally procured stock, but I am always ready to accept

gangers, and I have a few representatives from Australia, India,
nd South America amongst my birds.
The largest of my planted aviaries houses hornbills ( Lophocerus
asutus epirhinus), rollers ( Coracias garrulus, Coraciura caudata, Eucoracias
wsambicus), weavers, starlings, bulbuls, doves, barbets and thrushes
nd the smallest, a wide variety including most of our waxbills and
unbirds. It is, of course, difficult to keep such mixed families on
ood terms with each other, and every now and then a dispute ends
1 tragedy but, by and large, they seem to get along reasonably well.
)f course, I do keep the worst offenders to themselves, but it is quite
stonishing--at least to me--how frequently one can find a real
bad-egg " amongst what normally is considered a peaceful species.
As I write, a new breeding season is upon us and there is activity
1 all directions. As usual, I am hoping for miracles but will, of course,
e satisfied with whatever the fates permit. I hold crossed fingers for
ly African Greys, down on eggs for the fifth or sixth time, but who
ave never yet " delivered the goods ". I have hopes that my Lilac-
reasted Rollers and Sunbirds will this season do something more
lan play at raising a family--a pastime which they apparently enjoy,
always feel that it is a poor reward for days spent rushing around the
eighbourhood collecting cobwebs--arousing in the process the
ravest suspicions amongst individuals who, at the best of times, are
pt to look upon the aviculturist as not quite " all there "--and
etching a beautiful nest grow before one's eyes, to find the couple
iddenly lose interest. Incidentally, I have in my aviaries Scarlet-
reasted, Amethyst, Marico, Purple-banded, Neergaard's, White-
reasted, Collared, Grey, and Olive Sunbirds, and such attempts at
est construction that I have witnessed, both in the aviaries and out,
ave been the work of the female only. The male appears to spend
lost of his time urging his wife to greater and greater efforts, though
e is never averse to passing the time of day with any other member
f the opposite sex who might pass his way.
Just in case it might be of interest to fellow aviculturists, I list the
)ecies which have bred successfully in my aviaries, i.e. the young

young which for some reason or another have not made the grade
I am one of that group which does not believe in disturbing any bin-
that is about its business of raising a family, so I cannot provid
much information regarding the number of eggs laid, incubatio
periods, etc. Food is of the widest possible variety ; all kinds of seec
fruit, bread soaked in milk, minced meat, insectivorous foods, liv
food (grasshoppers, mealworms, gentles, white ants), greenfood, s
there is something for all tastes, and it is surprising what some of then
will eat. To me a Sunbird with a juicy piece of minced meat wa
something unexpected. Those which share the Sunbird aviary als-
enjoy the nectar mixture and fruit flies, and the bird that does not tak
some nectar certainly is the exception.
I do a certain amount of trapping myself but, having a business t
attend to, the opportunities are few and far between. The natives
however, bring in specimens from time to time, and it is really 01
them that I rely for replenishing and adding to my collection. Fat
also lends a hand, as one may judge from the following two incident
which may prove of interest.
I had been trying for some time to secure a Black-collared Barbel
but could never find a native collector with sufficient intelligence t
find one of the hollow logs in which these Barbets normally roosl
One day, however, I was doing some writing in my study when ou
cook-boy approached with a bird clutched in his hand--a CollareJ
Barbet, of course ! As he had been walking through our back yard
the bird had fallen at his feet, having apparently stunned itself b
striking an overhead telephone wire. This in the middle of a fair!
large town.
The second incident concerns a Narina Trogon (.Apaloderma narina)
I was telephoned one afternoon by my wife who, though she bears wit!
my affliction, is not too well versed in bird identification, to say ;
Coucal was flying around our garden and the gardener thought h
could catch it--should she permit the attempt. Not wishing to dam]
her enthusiasm, I agreed, and when I returned home about 5 p.m
I facetiously demanded to see the bird, only to be told that it hac
disappeared. My wife, however, insisted on my going out to se
exactly where the Coucal had been spotted and lo, there was n&lt;
Coucal, but a Narina Trogon. All forces were summoned, but th
bird made off and I said good-bye to my hopes of owning one c
those beautiful jewels.
Next day I was busy in my office situated in the centre of a ver
busy port area, when a friend walked in with a bird in his hand--yes
the Trogon. He had been walking along the street to see me 01
business when this bird flew into his stomach and stunned itseli
Admittedly the target was of no mean size, but what luck. Both bird

(.Amazona autumnalis autumnalis )
By E. N. T. Vane (Great Missenden, England)
The Yellow- or Primrose-cheeked Amazon is found fairly well
iistributed in south-east Mexico and the northern areas of Central
\merica, but only occasionally are odd specimens available in this
:ountry. According to Peters' Check List it is only regarded as a
sub-species to Salvin's, Lesson's or Lilacine and the Diademed
\mazons, but it is without doubt by far the most handsome of the four.
The body colour is a bright green, lighter on the under parts,
rhe frontal band is a bright cerise, the crown a delicate pale lilac
i)lue, the edge of each feather being darker. This colour merges into
;he green of the nape and mantle and again these feathers are
imarginated with a blackish shade. The cheeks are chrome-yellow
extending from the bill below the eye to the ear-coverts, this area
peing flecked with cerise in some cases. On the bend of the wing
s a patch of pale yellowish-green. The primaries are bluish and there
s an orange-red speculum. The tail is green, lighter on the underside
md yellowish towards the tip. The bill is yellowish horn with blackish
ireas on the upper mandible. The eye is brilliant gold which can
/ary considerably, sometimes when excited the pupil becomes very
imall and the iris literally blazes, at other times the colour appears
:o separate into two rings of red and yellow. The eye is surrounded
py a narrow, white skin orbital area, and in some birds the eyes appear
:o have distinct lashes. The feet are grey, with black claws. The sexes
ire alike, though cocks are larger in the head and bill. Immature
pirds resemble the parents in all details, except that the eye is dark
prown and the bill darker towards the point of the upper mandible.
Some specimens have traces of yellow on the throat. Length is about
[4 to 15 inches.
The pair of birds in my possession started laying when they were
ibout three years old. They have twice succeeded in hatching young
previously, and have had young dead in shell every other season ;
:he eggs have always been fertile. The cock is most aggressive in the
breeding season, indeed he is always seeking the opportunity to
ittack someone or something and frequently vents his spite on his
poor hen, who is a charmingly friendly bird by comparison. His
avourite amusement is to knock her off the perch and watch her
:limb back. She accepts this as normal good manners, and always
akes her time to come back within his reach. She regards any outside
nterference in this procedure as unwarranted between husband and
vife, and is always ready to join him in a cursing match. This trait
s probably the cause of their repeated failures to rear their young, as

every year just as the hen should be incubating, it is time for th
adjoining land to be ploughed or sown, and this is the signal for th
cock to start his nonsense. They are both good talkers, and hav
taught several of the other birds to talk as well. It is always amusin
to hear the cock encouraging the hen in the depths of the nest boJ
and to hear her muffled replies coming back. But every time he star
swearing at the farm hands over the hedge, or any other intrude
such as a cat, fox, or other visitor, the hen immediately joins him an
comes off her eggs. Unfortunately, this amuses visitors, who ai
of course, entirely unauthorized, and they linger and talk to th
parrots and are frequently indignant when asked to clear off.
Last year our Grey Parrot laid two clutches of eggs on the floe
of her cage--one of the usual 18-inch square type--and incubate
them assiduously. Naturally these were abortive as she had no matt
but we decided to take advantage of her exemplary behaviour prq
vided she laid at the same time as the Amazons. " Polly " woul
not tolerate any form of nesting material for her eggs ; woode
nest-pans and shallow boxes of peat, sand, and rotten chips wer,
tried, but she laboriously removed the lot or pushed them asidd
Again she laid this Spring, rather earlier than usual, but it coincide
with the Amazons nesting in their flight (which is only about 18 fe(
long with a nest-box outside ; they seem to prefer to climb thoug
both are excellent fliers when so inclined), so we put our intention t
exchange the eggs into operation ; there was little to lose, anyhow, z\
sure enough they started to plough the field three days after incubatio
should have started.
Collecting the Grey's eggs was a simple matter, she never mine
anything I do to her, and when the eggs were removed she just gc
up on the perch and had a good feed. She really was not perturbec:
and seemed to be quite confident that I would return the eggs ur
harmed in due course. Getting the Amazon's eggs was quite anothe
matter altogether. The box was outside the flight, covered externall
with an asbestos sheet in case the birds whittled their way right througl
a task well within their powers, as they strip a three-inch perch in
day and soon finish it altogether ; but strangely enough they hav
had this same nest-box for seven seasons and have scarcely damage
it beyond enlarging the entrance hole. After several attempts t
manoeuvre the birds away from their box, we finally succeeded i
stuffing a sack in the hole from the top of the box and removed th
eggs with a long-handled ladle, replacing them with the infertil
Grey's eggs. There were only two Amazon eggs, their usual elute
being three. These were duly given to " Polly " on the thickly sandei
floor of her cage in the living room on 27th May, when she promptl
started incubating closely. Meanwhile the Amazons carried on a
in previous years. The hen duly retired to the box, but the cock wa

o aggressive and demonstrative that she was constantly coming off
o see what all the bother was about. On 16th June, she was off for
pfite a lengthy period, and after the usual ceremony of the cock
mocking her off the perch, I decided to have another look. She had
aid a third egg which was again removed. I had taken the pre-
:aution of marking the eggs, which were almost identical in size
md appearance. The Grey's were possibly a little more rounded,
3ut it would have been most difficult to distinguish them with any
legree of certainty. This occurred during a very hot spell of weather
when the Amazon was sitting very lightly, in fact almost appeared to
lesert for a few days, although she brooded every night. It is possible
hat these birds, coming from a very hot climate, might well rely on
;he heat of their surroundings to keep their nest warm for quite
engthy periods during daylight hours, and this may account for their
msatisfactory results in this country in other years.
" Polly " sat very closely in the corner of the room we used daily,
ffie was perfectly friendly and normal, and used to come off and
eed regularly every morning when her bowls of food and water were
&apos;enewed. She still liked to have her poll scratched, and once this
was done, she immediately settled down to her task once more, and
Yas left undisturbed for the rest of the day. This was exactly as she
aehaved on other occasions.
Mr. Arthur Lamb has recorded that when he bred an Amazon the
ncubation period was twenty-one days, so we calculated that these
iggs were due to hatch any time after 19th June. About this time
' Polly " started to soak her breast and thigh feathers each morning,
md since she did not resent my help, the eggs were floated in a bowl
ff warm water for a few minutes. One sank and the other two floated.
[ have not found this a reliable method of determining whether the
igg will hatch or not, but mention the fact for what it is worth. The
Glrey immediately returned to her eggs when they were replaced.
3n the 22nd the eggs were again submitted to this treatment, and
an this occasion there was a most definite movement in one of the
loating eggs and I could hear a definite tap from the interior. On
Sunday the 23rd, one egg had a clearly visible chip, and I could hear
the young bird squeaking inside the shell. Shortly before midday,
whilst I was out, the first little Yellow-cheek broke through. It was
assisted by the foster-mother who very carefully cut the top out in a
small circle, so that the young one wriggled through a hole leaving
the shell in two clean pieces. Of the other two eggs, one was clear
and one addled in the early stages. It is therefore assumed that
the latter was the egg removed on 16th June, which had been spoilt
by the unreliable sitting habit of the Amazon hen, and that the
ertile egg was removed on 29th May, together with the infertile
ane. So the incubation period was twenty-five to twenty-six days.

The African Grey was entirely calm and unperturbed with her
xomplishment, she behaved like an experienced mother, never in
le least worried but obviously very pleased with the result of her
itience. She brooded the chick very closely, making no attempt
1 feed it for the first twenty-four hours, although she repeatedly
eaned it. She moved it about by lifting it bodily by the head. She
as supplied with the usual seeds, bread and milk with Abidec added,
so soaked brown bread, with sprouted seeds and greenfood, which
ie enjoyed and consumed in increasing quantity as the youngster
&apos;ogressed.
We now had a unique opportunity to observe exactly how a parrot
ts about rearing its young, as the whole of the operation was carried
it oblivious to our close interest and observation. The parent
rd was completely absorbed in her task, and did not resent our
&apos;esence in the least. The first feed was given on the second day.
he young bird was first lifted bodily by the head, and the point of
e parent's upper mandible was then gently inserted into the small
tp of the youngster's mandibles right at the rear as shown in sketch i.
le then trickled liquid down her tongue into the opposite side of the
iby's mandibles. Once the young bird started feeding thus, this
ocedure was no longer necessary and as soon as the mother clucked,
e young one instinctively raised its head and gaped ready to accept
i food. Taking the tips of the mandibles in her beak the mother
en applied the usual pumping action of regurgitation and one
uld actually watch the young one's crop fill out (see sketch 2).
t this stage feeding was carried out with unfailing punctuality every
t&gt; hours. The consistency of the crop milk was about the same as
at of ordinary milk. For practically the whole of the first two weeks
e Grey brooded continuously, but thereafter left the nest for a
lile for longer and longer periods. Feeding intervals were slowly
creased to three hours, until six weeks had passed, when the meals
n-e increased in frequency, but decreased in bulk. During this time,
0, the consistency of the food was also thickened. By this time the
ung bird was becoming very intelligent and knew full well that every
ne mother had something to eat, it would get a taste, and it was not
.ckward in asking for its share.
At about ten days, the eyes began to open and quills began to
*pear. At this stage we were a little apprehensive that the difference
colour might upset the mother. We need not have concerned
rselves, however, as " Polly " was a most attentive and competent
rent. The floor of the cage became littered with seed husks, but no
tempt was made to clean it out for the first month in case she
rented it. I was in fact away at the time, and no one else dared put
hand inside the cage, this applied whether she had a youngster or
t. At a month old, the squab resembled nothing more than a dirty

but " Polly " thought it was the loveliest thing that ever happenec
and she spent hours cleaning it.
The young one grew rapidly, and as the feathers opened out th
young bird was deliberately taught to preen itself and was always i
spotless condition. The plumage was complete at seven weeks, exact!
similar to the adult bird's, except that the flight and tail feathers wer
not fully developed. The young bird was just over eight weeks ol
when it first succeeded in climbing on to the central perch--an ag
at which it would normally have reached the stage of peeping oi
of the nest hole. Its bill was blackish on the upper mandible, yellowis;
at the edges and towards the point. The eye was dark and the fet
grey. On its breast it has a few yellowish feathers. The fact that i
plumage is similar to the adult was interesting, as according to som
accounts, many Amazons are reputed to be all green when immatui
and to assume full colour when a year or more has passed.

Year after year numerous members inform us either that they hav
had a good breeding season or that they are satisfied with their result;
I am afraid we are never completely satisfied--but we are ourselvc
mainly to blame that our results fail to come up to our expectation
because we keep far too many birds. We seem to have a faculty fc
accumulating them !
During the winter all the pheasant pens and pigeon flights wei

Few of the parrakeets made any great success of such attempts as
:hey made to breed. The Pennants produced their usual brood, but
whereas in the previous four years the young have left the nest in full,
idult plumage, the four young this year were somewhat undersized,
mottled dark green and red. All the Lovebirds increased their kind,
out none of our pairs may be described as prolific. The Noble Macaws
laid three eggs, but scattered them at an early stage of incubation.
The colony of Lineolated Parrakeets just holds its own, a brood of three
ate in September making up for earlier losses.
The Red-faced Lovebird colony, numbering thirty-four, is a con-
tinual source of interest. Last year's success when one young one was
&quot;eared has not been repeated, but it is not yet too Tate.
A few new birds have been added to the wilderness aviary : Hilde-
Drandt's Starlings, Chinese Hawfinches, Pekin Robins, and Red-
:ollared and Yellow-backed Whydahs. Here the Common Mynahs
reared broods of two and one ; the former very rickety, the latter a
perfect bird. Purple-headed Glossy Starlings had several broods, but
)nly succeeded in rearing one young one which was later scalped.
Many Zebra and other small finches leave the nests, but the majority
piite unaccountably disappear--presumably falling victims to some,
is yet, undetected predator.
The numerous pheasants, quails, bantams, pigeons and doves, both
iomestic and foreign, continue to thrive and, in the main, increase.
Our one real success, the breeding of the Green Imperial Fruit
Pigeon, made up for any disappointments. The young one hatched on
list September (see page 148) left the nest on the 22nd, and is as fine
1 bird as the first reared. We now have fourteen of these somewhat
/oracious pigeons, seven Green Imperial, and seven Pied Imperial.
The latter laid fourteen or fifteen eggs, but failed to hatch any.
The most important recent arrivals are four Black Bronze-winged
)r White-capped Ground Pigeons (Henicophaps albifrons schlegeli)
Drought from the Aru Islands by W. J. C. Frost. At present they are
/ery travel-stained, but eventually they should prove to be very
landsome birds.
The bird-rooms at present house seven White-bellied and four
31 ack-headed Caiques, five Senegal Parrots, one Mayer's Parrot, one
Ahite-winged and three Canary-winged Parrakeets, three Black-
:heeked Lovebirds, and one Greater Hill Mynah. Amongst our house
Darrots we suffered the loss of our favourite Grey " Cocotte ", a
venerable and very talented " lady " well known to many members

Adult Male. --Crest golden yellow slightly lighter than in the typical
form ; rest of face, chin, throat and sides of neck, light yellow ; cape
orange with the two steel blue bars as in the Golden Pheasant ; mantle
dark green, with the lower portion of each feather yellowish ; lowei
back and rump golden citron yellow ; central tail feathers pale
brown dotted with light yellowish ; other tail feathers irregularly
barred with pale brown and yellowish ; upper tail coverts same
colour as central tail feathers in the lower web, with the upper wet
yellow ; scapulars yellowish tipped with brown ; tertiaries and theii
coverts dark brown ; secondaries and their coverts barred with
more or less dark brown ; primaries light straw yellow ; all body
feathers yellow, lighter in the middle of abdomen and on the lowei
thigh ; tail-coverts yellow. Iris, wattles, and bare skin around
orbits yellow ; beak and legs yellow horn.
In substance, the more remarkable differences between this mutanl
and the typical form are the total substitution of a yellow colour foi
the scarlet, a dark brown for the blue of the wings, a citron yellow foi
the rich yellow of the back, a pale brown for the black of the tail
and wing-feathers, and the straw yellow primaries. Crest and cape are
the same as is the visible portion of the green mantle.
Young male. --General surface colour straw-yellow, very slightly
barred with pale brown in all sections. On the sides of head yellow
orange shades are noted. Wing and tail feathers have the same
pattern as the typical form, but are extremely light-coloured with
alternative bars or lines of brown and straw yellow.
Adult female. --Same pattern as in the typical form, but the general
surface colour instead of being buff barred and mottled, more or less
plentifully with black, appears straw yellow, barred and mottled with
brown, more or less pale according to the specimens and to the
sections of the body considered. Primaries and secondaries, pale
brown barred crosswise with straw yellow.
Chick. --Creamy white at birth ; as soon as the epitrichium of the
filoplumes has split the mottling appears the same as in the normal
chick, but in much lighter shades.
Origin. --The mutant male, first of the race, was brought to me:
already adult, by Mr. Alexander Hampe from Coburg, in 1952.
Having had an inkling of the matter through an advertisement issued
in an avicultural journal, he thought I would be interested, and
brought it to me. I was not able to obtain information about the place
of origin, but it seems to have been in Bavaria.

A. GHIGI-A NEW MUTATION OF THE GOLDEN PHEASANT 1 9 1
Breeding .--In the spring, 1953, a young normal golden female
nated with the mutant did not lay eggs ; in 1954 an offspring of the
isual colour resulted, whence it was shown that the mutant sire was
ecessive. Two heterozygous females of this generation were mated
vith their sire ; 1 entrusted Professor Taibel, Director of the Experi-
nental Poultry Station of Rovigo, with one heterozygous male and
wo heterozygous females.
In 1955 my heterozygous hens produced normal heterozygotes and
ecessive mutant homozygotes in the same proportions ; Professor
raibel obtained in Rovigo 75 per cent normal dominants and 25 per
:ent homozygous recessives.
In the spring of the following year, 1956, it was confirmed that the
nutants are homozygous, as both my young mutant specimens and
hose from Rovigo (Taibel) exclusively produced mutants.
My breeding was not very successful in 1956. The old cock, maybe
jecause of the terrible cold suffered during the winter, did not fer-
ilize the eggs of the first brood, but all the eggs laid by the hens
nated with the young male were fertilized. Furthermore, various
iccidents caused the death of some chicks during the rearing season.
\nyway, excluding the first of the race, we now possess two adult
nales and three adult females, three year-old males and six year-old
emales. Altogether we have, the first of the race excepted, five adult
nales and nine adult females. I have sent one adult male and two
/oung females to the Zoological Garden of Rome ; furthermore,
ast spring, I shipped a pen formed by one male and two females,
ill heterozygous of the usual colour, to the Zoological Garden of
Copenhagen, from where I have not yet had news concerning an
eventual mutant offspring.
Some further observations may be added :
(1) The adult male, that lives now in the Zoological Garden of
Rome is not perfectly similar to the sire ; some feathers of the throat
show a brown edging, so that the bird appears to have a small collar
in the throat.
(2) The plumage colour is not of the same richness in all the female
specimens ; some have darker bars compared with others. One must
consider that the first mutant cock, arising from normal forms, may
carry some multiple factor, to which a further variability is due.
The above facts will be the subject of careful control in the next,
1 957? breeding season.
Note .--In this breeding season (1957) I have reared about fifty
mutant chicks.

By Karl Plath, Curator of Birds (Brookfield, Ill., U.S.A.)
" What's new at Brookfield this year ? " This question can be
heard every year, for each year a new attraction is added for the
benefit of the public. Last year an Okapi, before that the Otter
Grotto, modernistic but attractive, before that the enormously popular
Children's Zoo, a flock of the delightful, tiny Fairy Penguins (about
1 o inches high), a generous gift from one of our benefactors, Sir Edward
Hallstrom, of Sydney, Australia, then from the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo
came Emperor and Adelie Penguins. So now we have the extremes
in size of these fascinating birds, for the lovable little Fairy Penguins
scarcely weigh 2 pounds, while the largest of our three Emperors
(about 4 feet high) weighed 80 pounds on arrival, and feels like a sack
of sand when one bumps against it. Comparing the Emperor with the
smaller King Penguin shows that the former has much more bulk,
while the slimmer King which is about 10 inches shorter weighs
on an average of 35 pounds. The Emperors, Kings, Adelies, and
Humboldts occupy a large, glass-fronted cage about 30 feet across
and 10 feet deep, with a glass-fronted pool almost as large, where
they disport themselves with abandon. This enclosure is kept at a
temperature between 50* and 6o*, usually 54 0 (fahrenheit), with
germicidal lamps for germ-proof atmosphere and filters for pure air.
The Fairy Penguins are kept in winter in one of the wall-cages (about
15 feet long), and in summer are active in one of the larger pools.
But this article is to tell members of our latest remodelling--that of
the Perching Bird House which attracted considerable attention about
ten years ago in the making of a series of " picture-cages ", twenty of
them along the east and west wings of the building. These are metal-
framed, glass-fronted cages and are used for individual specimens
best kept apart, such as the toucans, hornbills, several birds of paradise
(also gifts from Sir Edward), and others. Now the effect is a long
gallery of animated pictures, the subjects living birds behind their
glass fronts. The lights are in the cages, and the passage dark. A large
double door is at each end, but the main entrance is at the centre
of this long gallery. When the visitor enters here he sees at first, or
is aware of, large glass cages on each side of the door with numerous
colourful small birds but he is mainly attracted to the huge " Freedom
Room " which confronts him. This has no wire, no glass, and a portion
of the picture gallery floor of beautiful terrazza extends into this open
aviary. This has a railing to prevent the visitor from stepping down
into it. In former years this large room had thirty-three wire-fronted
cages all around it and a medium sized flying-cage in the centre.
The alteration was started early in 1956, and opened to the public

Christmas Day, 1956. The construction is of stainless steel and
ite-glass, and the effect is very elegant.
This main room has been transformed into a garden of exotic plants
d flowers. There are three trees with bare branches for perching
d a tall hollow tree in one corner partly hidden by a large date
lm. There is more than one ground level--a little pool in a corner
the top trickles into a larger one below it, and that again flows
to a large pool which overflows by means of a gurgling waterfall
to the largest pool immediately in the foreground beneath the rail,
mbrella plants, banana plants, anthuriums, various aquatic plants,
d many kinds of flowering plants border these pools and add to the
)pical effect.
To keep the interest below there are several striking aquatic birds--
arlet Ibis, Jacanas, Stilts, Crocodile Birds, a pair each of Mandarin
acks, Formosan Teal, and several others. These birds are content
stay in the water or on the ground, with the exception of a tame
d fearless Sun-Bittern which often perches on the rail and sometimes
(erates a little petting. In the trees and flying all about are other
autiful birds--gorgeous rollers, motmots, Quetzal, barbets, touracos,
d a brilliantly red Cock-of-the-Rock which often flies into the
llery. Several other birds do this, Giant Whydahs, Long-tailed
arlings, tanagers, Vermilion Cardinals, and some others, but all seem
ntent to fly back and enjoy this brilliantly lighted bird paradise. The
eat skylight 30 feet above protects the birds from flying up against it
r being covered with plastic waffle-like panels. There are four double
0 watt lamps in the wall above, not too noticeable, and several
ore lamps set below the floor under the railing beneath the floor.
1 of this light in the big cage makes the gallery comparatively dark,
that most of the birds are happy to stay in the open-front aviary,
lis improvement has worked wonders with the public, who are
lighted and amazed when a brilliantly plumed Quetzal or touraco
as their heads as it swoops by. Seemingly the birds have never been
ore enjoyed.
Of course we had to consider the nature and habits of the birds
at were to be at large, and they had to be compatible. We knew
at the jays and other large omnivorous birds would not be desirable,
&gt;r would most of the seed-eating finches which would also nibble
the plant life ; so for these classes of birds there are other large
mmunity glass cages, to accommodate various jays, oropendolas,
ee-pies, Australian butcher birds, and two smaller cages housing
e larger orioles, tanagers, and grosbeaks. For humming birds,
mbirds, and callistes we have twelve comparatively small cages, as
ost of these species do best kept separately. Our most interesting
imming bird to date is the very tiny Vervain from Jamaica. Gener-
ly speaking, it is our opinion that sunbirds do better ; they are

Our Parrot House, while one of the Zoo's older buildings, still hou;
a good collection. One outstanding member is a beautiful Guildin;
Amazon (from the Bronx Zoo), and in all we have forty-six spec.
(240 individuals) in this building. We are fortunate in being able
keep all of these parrots outdoors from May to October, and have h
good luck in breeding many of the larger Australian psittacines
well as others ; outstanding being Grand Eclectus, Grays, and Rose?
Cockatoos--unusual for this latitude.
Later on we hope to do an article on the varied species in t
beautiful Aquatic House ; we did do something on this years ag
but many rarer specimens have been added.

There are from one to five of each of the above birds in this
Freedom Room We did try a magnificent Racket-tailed Drongo,
ut the first thing he did was to snap up two tiny Painted Quail, and
e was removed pronto. We would like to mention here what I think
; the longevity record of a Spiny-cheeked Honey-eater which lived
*om May, 1934, until December, 1956. With such a record, I would
ot trust his safety with other birds, nor would I do so with a Hard-
/icke's Green Bulbul received in October, 1936, and still in perfect
lumage as was the Honey-eater.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
In the ten years that we have had a collection at Slimbridge,
07 forms of wildfowl have nested, and of these 100 kinds have
een reared. Whilst a number of species have been reared for the first
ime in Europe, perhaps our greatest contribution to aviculture has
een the re-establishment of the Hawaiian Goose ( Branta sandvicensis)
om the three birds presented to us by Mr. Shipman in 1949. Fifty-
ve birds have been reared, representing an estimated third of the
world's population. Twelve have been reared by Mr. Terry Jones at
.eckford, in whose care we placed a pair of birds some three years ago.
iearing in mind the possible loss of the Slimbridge flock from epidemic
auses we have established pairs at our Peakirk branch, at Cleres,
nd with Mr. Schuyl at Rotterdam ; a pair has been returned to
unerica under the care of Dr. Dillon Ripley. The Hawaiian Goose is
robably the world's second rarest bird, and consequently the Trust
; very proud of its effort in the attempt to save this beautiful goose
&apos;om extinction.

Ig6 S. T. JOHNSTONE NOTES FROM THE WILDFOWL TRUST
1957 has been far and away our most successful breeding season
No doubt the improved breeding results were aided by the gloriouf
weather of May, June, and early July, so that by the time the bad
weather of August arrived the majority of the young birds were full)
feathered and past danger.
But we must record a new method of feeding the young birds. Alj
were reared entirely on dry Turkey Starter crumbs, and certainly il
would seem that this had a very beneficial effect, not only on the
numbers reared, but also on the rate of growth. Over 750 birds have
been reared, representing 75 per cent of those hatched. The figures
are as follows :--

Failure was recorded with the Bewick's Swan ( Cygnus columbiams
bewickii), the first clutch of five eggs being spoilt when the sitting pen
was disturbed by the many visitors who came to the New Grounds
this summer. The second clutch of eggs were unfortunately infertile.
A further disappointment was the loss of nine of the fourteen Ne-ne
that hatched, owing to a heavy burden of tapeworm. On the other
hand, the Magpie Geese ( Anseranas semipalmata) have been extremely
successful : six birds have been reared by foster mothers and a further
five by the parent birds.
The Australian Grey Teal ( Anas gibberifrons mathewsi) has been
reared for the first time, and two drakes and a duck have been added
to the collection. The Ringed Teal ( Anas leucophrys ) did very well, and
we have added thirty birds to the original stock.
From our own point of view the most interesting species that we
were successful with was the Smew ( Mergus albellus). We have had a
wild-caught female and three males at Slimbridge for the past six
years, and although in recent years the female showed signs of getting
" heavy" it was not until 1957 that she nested. In a small barrel
some 2 feet from the ground the first egg was found on 12th June,
closely resembling that of Carolina [Aix sponsa ) in size, colour, and
texture. Altogether five eggs were laid. A large amount of down
was pulled after the third egg. The parent bird was allowed to sit
on the eggs for the first ten days, and they were then removed and
incubated under a bantam in the normal way. The incubation period
lasted twenty-six days, and all five eggs hatched, the ducklings being
extremely like young Golden-eye (. Bucephala clangula clangula), the
downy pattern being identical. Two ducklings soon fell behind and
died, but the remaining birds thrived. Their early diet was fresh-
water shrimp with trout fry, the fry being increased in size as the
birds grew. Turkey Starter crumbs were also given, and when the

By Sir Edward Hallstrom (Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
Perhaps the most interesting experience I have had this year has
jeen with the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet. The cross between the
jolden-shouldered and the Hooded has proved to be fertile, and some
oungsters from this cross are now fully matured. I have tried to
ross the Golden-shouldered and the Many-coloured Parrakeet ;
found that the older Golden-shouldered male would have nothing
o do with the Many-coloured females. It then became necessary for
ne to rear youngsters of both birds together and now, after several
r ears of waiting, I have three pairs that I feel quite sure will take up
Lousekeeping in a very short time, as the males are already driving
he females. My stock of Golden-shouldered Parrakeets has increased
o fifteen pairs plus a few extra, odd males. Young Golden-shouldereds
&gt;arely a year old have gone to nest, and have reared youngsters,
fhe cross between the Hooded and the Many-coloureds apparently are
nfertile. I have had at least a dozen pairs go to nest, without pro-
lucing a single chick.
Some of the interesting birds I bred last year were some Red and
Hue Macaws, Red and Yellow Macaws, Blue and Yellow Macaws,
t nd more Glossy Black Cockatoos. One Banksian Cockatoo was
ompletely reared by hand from the day it was hatched. Its mother
00k no interest in the baby ; we undertook the job for her.
There were four Red-bellied Gonures, four Cactus Conure crosses,
is before, a great many African Lovebirds--Fischer's, Peach-faced,
Tasked, and Nyasa. Five African Grey Parrots, with three more
&gt;abies in the nest at the moment, and three baby Cloncurry Parrots.
? or years I have wanted to breed the Cloncurry, but never seemed to be
ible to get a female. At last I have three females, and to-day one pair
ire sitting, a pair only a year old have gone to nest, and another nice
)air have mated and are very interested in the nest-box.

Several years ago I sent out a very carefully planned expeditioi
and procured some Blue-cheeked Rosellas ; two pairs, one of whicl
are only twelve months old, are now sitting on eggs. I had never seei
Blue-cheeked Rosellas before. They are not even mentioned ii
Cayley's book, What Bird is That ?, but they were recorded by Gould
1 hope that within a week or two I will have established the firs!
breeding record.
A few days ago, on making a check through my nest-boxes, I fount;
many young Eclectus Parrots, a number of eggs, and a great man&apos;
of the commoner Australian parrots. I have also two pairs of Yellow
winged Conures. There are at the moment five pairs of Macaws sitting
on eggs.
I have another interesting youngster in the nest, about twelve day
old at the moment--a Ribbon-tailed Bird of Paradise (Taenia paradise ,
mayeri ). This, of course, is the first to be bred in captivity, and I an
glad that the credit goes to me. They are in an aviary with quiti
heavy undergrowth. The female chose a very thick privet bush ii
which to build. She was supplied with ample nesting material, anc
built a nest quite 9 inches across, cup-shaped, the middle of the nes
is no more than 2 inches deeper than the rim.
It took quite a long time to understand the mating habits of these
birds by actual observation. Mating usually takes place after ai
attractive display by the male, and in the case of my birds, of whicl
there are two more pairs sitting at the moment, was finally complete!
on the ground whilst the birds were locked together by the feet ii
such a manner that caused me to misunderstand the mating fo
fighting, which perhaps delayed my success with this particular species
After mating, the male takes no further interest in the female, th&lt;
nest or the youngster. Special food, a mixture of fruit and yolk 0
e ggj was supplied, with a small handful of mealworms. The mal(
apparently has respected this food and left it entirely alone, eatim
only the standard Bird of Paradise food that is provided in th&lt;
ordinary way.
The aviary is about 30 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 7 feet high. Th&lt;
whole of the floor is concreted ; along either side of the aviary i.
planted privet, and other shrubby plants, in beds 12 feet long. Thest
were built up from the concrete some 18 inches, leaving plenty 0
soil for the privet. The rest of the aviary was covered with leaf whicl
soon became mould ; the mould is allowed to build up to betweer
2 and 3 inches ; this becomes a wormery, as literally thousands 0
earthworms breed in this litter. It is necessary, of course, to keep i

lumbers of termites daily, and also supply large white grubs, giving
he parent a wide range of food from which to choose.
The youngster when hatched was a shiny black, quite ugly. It
s now twelve days old, and pin-feathers are beginning to become
tpparent. When I found that this creature had been hatched, I got
n touch with the Australian Museum, and in a few days, when it is
afe to do so, Dr. Keast is being sent out to observe the baby, so
hat the record of this breeding can be verified.
The position in which the bird has the nest, in dense foliage, pre-
cludes photographs from being taken for the time being. I would hate
o disturb or frighten the mother and perhaps prevent the very nice
^xtra feather in my avicultural cap.

By K. W. Dalton (Hallow, Worcs, England)
An African Grey Parrot hen and a Timneh cock which I purchased
m the spring of 1956 laid four eggs on the floor of the shelter. They
sat for about four weeks, but the eggs were not fertile.
This year I stood a hollow log on the floor of the shelter and they
soon went to nest, four eggs were laid and both birds stayed in the
nest all the time except for feeding. About the 27th June young were
first heard, three of the eggs hatched and for the first two weeks, due
to the very hot weather, neither of the parents brooded in the day
time, but both did at night. Two of the young had black beaks
the other a white one. The next three weeks were very wet and both
birds brooded night and day, the cock Timneh coming off now and
again to get food which consisted of apple, hemp, and monkey nuts,
and though sunflower seed was offered little was taken, but very
large quantities of water were drunk. During the sixth week the young
one with the white beak died. The following week the parents only
brooded at night and the young started to get feathers on head and
wings. Three weeks later, when the young were half-grown, another
one died and I can only put this down to suffocation at night as both
parents brooded at night. Food taken was as before but now more
sunflower seed was eaten, the parents were still brooding at night and
this continued until the surviving young one left the nest-box when
13 weeks old. It has a reddish brown tail like the Timneh cock.

necks, Stanley, Rosellas, hybrid Brown's X Yellow Rosella, anc
Queen of Bavaria's Conure. Princess, lutino Ring-necks, yellow Red-
rumps did not breed.
The nesting of the Bavarias is the most amazing result for the paii
are not perfect specimens. The male is a pinioned bird, and th(
female has a flight impediment, and though she flies it is with some
difficulty. Accordingly it is all the more surprising that on ist Jul&gt;
I found the female on three eggs. As the pair go in and out of theii
nest and use it for a play-pen most of the time, I had not realizec
that they were nesting. She had not been noticed spending any special
amount of time in the nest. It was my impression, on ist July, that
the three eggs were fresh. On 4th July it was 104 degrees in the
garden, despite large, shady trees. Noting the female was off, and had
been off almost continually during the day, I took a quick look-see.
The initial impression was dismay, for broken egg-shells were in
evidence. Then, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness in the
interior of the box, two small bits of fluff and one egg could be seen.
It had been my original impression that the broken egg-shells had
indicated that they had used the eggs as toys, but what elation to find
they had actually done the right thing and incubated them !
Despite an almost 100 per cent conviction on my part that the
parents would refuse to feed, or murder the chicks, or the box would
fall to the ground, or the weather would cook the chicks, the birds
have continued to thrive. Since then the third egg has hatched, and
the chick has grown apace, so that there is very little difference between
the three in size.
The weather has been the greatest worry. The summer has been
the hottest in several summers, and since ist July there has not been
a day with a temperature of less than 80 degrees, and several days
with the temperature over the century mark. Still, the parents and
chicks are doing well, so one should not worry, especially since it must
be very warm in their native habitat.
Both parents apparently feed the young and have from the first.
The male spends the night in the nest, which is about 18 inches by
18 inches by 3 feet high. The box is hung under a shelter. The young
are quite noisy and, while the parents are feeding, their calls can quite
easily be heard at a distance of 50 feet.

D. M. WEST-BREEDING OF THE QUEEN OF BAVARIA'S CONURE 201
The female is the more aggressive bird, but does not appear to be
oo upset when an inspection of the box is made. As the box is at eye
5V el, I do not have to touch the nest, but can look directly in and see
he young. Inspections have been made each week, and on very hot
lays when the temperature has been in the 90's or ioo's, an inspection
5 made daily for fear that one of the young might have died and the
mell would cause the parents to quit the nest.
Food : The parents are surprisingly unimaginative. They are very
ond of fresh corn on the cob, and will eat at least three large ears of
his a day. Formerly they were very fond of orange and apple, but at
jresent they do not eat much of them. Grapes are flung to the ground
n disgust, and ditto pine nuts. The only seed they eat in quantity
s sunflower and a little oats. Canary and millet are almost totally
gnored. Greens are not much appreciated. It is obvious that the
nost important article in their diet while rearing young is the flesh
:orn. It is surprising to me how often they go to the water bowl to
Irink. Apparently they are a species that requires an inordinate
imount of water while rearing young.
At the age of some thirty-five days the young were just beginning to
ihow pin-feathers in the wing and tail. Now, at the age of six weeks
:hey are almost fully covered with feathers, and quite large in size.
Still, it would be my guess that they will be at least another three
weeks in the nest. While they were without feathers their body colour
reminded one of the body colour of young lutino or albino parrakeets
quite pinkish.
This is not a first breeding for the U.S., but must be the second
recorded breeding. Previously in California the Sun Conure went
under the name of cc Golden " Conure, and for this reason seveial
people have, erroneously, been given credit for breeding the Queen of
Bavaria's Conure. Some gentleman in Louisiana has bred the Queen
of Bavaria's Conure and has reared three, although I believe he helped
the parents and hand-fed the youngsters from time to time, although
this fact certainly should not detract from his accomplishment. It is my
understanding that the adult pair and one of their youngsters have been
purchased by Mr. Rudkin, Junr., and are in his collection at Fillmore.
I believe that the youngsters will emerge from the nest with their
plumage streaked with green. Mr. H. Zelenko, of New York City,
has told the writer that a Bavaria in his possession laid eggs while
still in immature (streaked green) plumage. Does this indicate they
mature early, for somewhere it seems to me I've read that mature
plumage is assumed at the end of the first year ? This has been the
case with the young bird reared in Louisiana, for it was in full adult
(clear yellow) plumage by the end of fifteen or sixteen months.

202 D. M. WEST-BREEDING OF THE QUEEN OF BAVARIA'S CONURE
Postscript:
At the end of the tenth week the youngsters left the nest. The
youngest of the three birds left the nest too early, and daily would
end up on the ground. This necessitated my replacing him in the
nest every evening, and the following day the process would be
repeated. This discouraging situation finally resulted in the removal
of this bird from the aviary, and hand-feeding " him I believe this
bird to be a male, as it is very brightly coloured.
The remaining two youngsters were replaced each night in the
nest-box for the first week after they came out. After the first week,
however, they have been able to find their way back to the nest each
night by themselves, and at the present time the parents and the two
youngsters all sleep in the box together and without any fighting.
The young began to eat by themselves about the third day after
leaving the nest. The parents take very good care of them, and
constantly hover about the youngsters, even at this late date.
(23rd October, 1957.) The youngsters are quite reluctant fliers, and
prefer to crawl about rather than fly, though when forced into it
they fly very well.
The parents are now back again mating regularly, and appear
somewhat interested in the nest-box. However, the colder weather is
coming upon us, and I doubt that their present interest will be
long-lived.
It should be added that the two youngsters living with their parents
have the same terrible galaxy of cries and yells that their parents have.
The four birds greet each new dawn with a full assortment of terrible
shrieks and cries . . . about the only drawback to this wonderfully
coloured bird.

The fourth of the B.B.C. Television Service's " Zoo Quest " expedi-
ons set out in June, this time for the Central Highlands of New
luinea where David Attenborough and Charles Lagus stayed at
Jondugl as guests of Sir Edward Hallstrom, filming the animal
fe of the Wahgi and Jimi Valleys and later visiting the Bismarck
/fountains. Sir Edward's fauna station at Nondugl is, as members
now, in the care of Mr. F. Shaw Mayer, who, it will be remembered,
irought a number of rare and beautiful Papuan birds to London
iefore the war. The collection brought to the Zoo by David Atten-
*orough in October called to mind those far-off days, for it contained
hirteen Birds of Paradise, the largest number to be exhibited here
ince about 1940. These came from the large aviaries at Nondugl as
, present from Sir Edward, the complete list (those new to the Collec-
ion marked with an asterisk) of his gift being : --

It will be noticed that the common names used for some of these
)irds are adaptations of the specific or sub-specific name, as the case
nay be. The reason for this is that these particular races appear to
lave no separate common name.
Some of the Birds of Paradise are still in the immature plumage.
The Superb is the one described by Iredale as L. superba addenda ;
[ am not sure if this is an accepted name, but if so, the sub-specific
lame minor given above can be corrected later.
A great deal should be written about this magnificent collection,
md it is hoped, if all goes well, to publish more detailed notes with
photographs, though, as we all know, only coloured plates can do
ustice to Birds of Paradise.

J. J. YEALLAND-LONDON ZOO NOTES
Attenborough had to take the collection (which, of course, alsc
included some mammals and reptiles) to Rabaul, by sea to Hong
Kong where he stayed with Dr. Searle, and thence by air to London
On the same plane came a pair of Chinese Starlings presented b\
Dr. Searle and a Javan Brahminy Kite and a Siberian Ground Thrush
given by Mr. G. H. Newmark.
A Tengmalm's Owl that flew on board one of the ships taking pari
in the N.A.T.O. exercises off the Lofoten Islands has been presented :
also a Duck Hawk or North American Peregrine (.Falco peregrinm
anatum) which flew on to a grain ship off Baffin Island. The Duck
Hawk is the first to be received here. A Red-fronted Woodpecker
was sent as a present from Mrs. D. Seggar, who has previously giver
various birds collected in British Guiana, and a Bronzy Sunbird has
been received in exchange.
Cormorants that nested on the imitation cliff in the Southern
Aviary and reared two young earlier in the year have now re-made
their nests in the trees, using the old materials.
Editor&apos;s Note .--With regard to the " common names " given to the
Birds of Paradise in the above Notes, it is difficult to understand
why it is considered necessary to do this. It should be emphasized that
these so-called " common names " applied to rare exotic species,
which are most unlikely ever to become common birds, have no real
significance. For many years the Zoological Society of London, as in
the present instance, seems to have invented " common names " by
translating the specific or sub-specific name into the nearest English
equivalent. This practice has never been followed in horticulture
where the internationally accepted Latin name is retained for all rare
species, and there would seem to be no real reason for departing
from this generally accepted procedure. In addition the translation
of such " common names " into other languages is liable to lead to
confusion which could never arise if the correct nomenclature had
been maintained.

Exchange and Mart Scheme
Members often have odd birds for which they are unable to obtain
a mate. In order to facilitate the exchange of such birds the Council
have decided to inaugurate this scheme.
Any member who wishes to take advantage of the scheme should
send to Mr. C. M. Payne a postal order for 5i., and particulars of
the bird required or for disposal. If Mr. Payne has a record of such
a bird from another member he will advise both members, who will
then be in a position to communicate with each other. It is not the
intention that the Society should take any part in the negotiations.
The payment of 5L will entitle the member to the benefits of the
scheme until the 31st December, 1958.
Mr. Payne's address is : The Malt House, Barford, Warwickshire.

Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Darnton were unable to show " Birds, Beasts,
and Butterflies of Equatorial Africa " as notified to members, because
this film has not yet been completed. Instead, they showed " Tobago
and nesting Flamingos in the Caribbean ".
Mrs. Darnton has provided the following summary :--
" We spent last winter in Trinidad, Tobago, and Bonaire, and our
film opens with various scenes taken round the lovely coast of Tobago
and of the even more lovely hills and valleys of the island itself. When
we were there, these valleys and hillsides were aflame with the
spectacular flowers of the Erythrinas grown for shading the cocoa,
and from many of these trees hung the long, pendulous nests of the
Crested Hang-nest (Ostinops decumanus ) whose activities we filmed.
" We also found a Hairy Hermit Humming Bird (Glaucis hirsuta
insularum) attaching her nest with cobwebs to the tip of a hanging
palm frond--a difficult subject for the camera, as the nest was only
lit for ten minutes or so in the early morning. Unfortunately this lack
of good lighting formed a problem throughout Trinidad and Tobago,
as many of the most beautiful birds of these islands, such as the Red-
capped Manakins, the Mot-mots, the Jacamars, and the Trogans,
are birds of the shadows, and so are impossible to photograph satis-
factorily.
" However, when we went to Bonaire this problem did not arise,

)r instead of dense, tropical vegetation and tall forests, we found
omparatively desert-like conditions--only trees and plants resistant
a a very low rainfall being able to survive. Here in this tiny island
re were fortunate in finding a colony of the Rosy Flamingo ( Phoeni -
ipterus ruber) actually nesting. This was extremely lucky for normally
biey do not nest until May, and we were there in early March. In
act we found several thousands of young birds of various ages already
unning about in great, grey flocks, while some of the adults were still
itting on eggs. This species of flamingo is undoubtedly the most
leautiful, and is said to be also the rarest. We were so entranced by
heir beauty that we used to get up at 5 a.m. every morning so as to
&gt;e at their feeding grounds just after dawn. To live almost among
hese lovely birds as we did for a fortnight, we felt was indeed a
Privilege we shall never forget."
The Chairman said he had seen numerous films of flamingos,
ut never one to equal the present. Judging by the applause, this
pinion was obviously shared by the large audience. These are
eally worthwhile films, and Mr. and Mrs. Darnton are to be heartily
ongratulated on the results of their recent visit to the West Indies.

Ring Ouzel paired with a Mistle Thrush. They had four eggs
two young were hatched, one of which thrives and is now over threi
months' old. It is described as looking rather like a very dark Mistk
Thrush.

Dr. Sten Bergman writes from Sorong, Dutch New Guinea
" I have excavated earth mounds of the Megapodes, where they la\
their eggs. I have succeeded in hatching two eggs in a cupboard
heated by a lamp burning day and night. I have thus had ar
opportunity of observing the very interesting and curious hatching
The chick kicks itself out of the egg and is able to fly as soon as it i:
dry. At present I have two chicks nearly two weeks old."

Robins are almost through their first moult. There are five splendid
young cocks, bringing the stock of this species up to pairs ! The
young Red-winged Blackbirds are also doing very well and one young
cock is already learning to display its scarlet shoulder tufts.
Zosterops had a magnificient little nest, entirely of plant fibres, but.
unfortunately, the two eggs appear to be infertile. The swarms oi
fruit and other flies which we " created " in anticipation of the arrival
of young Zosterops have greatly delighted the Tree Frogs, and their
response might lead one to think that I have the B.B.C. Male Voice
Choir in the birdroom."

income must be increased. This may best be done by the member

ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL. By Lieut.-Col. A. A. Johnso
and W. H. Payn. H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., London, 1957
Price 21s. net.
Though wildfowl are very popular and a large number of book
have been published, especially in recent years, on this group of birds
there have been comparatively few on keeping them in captivity
Rose Hubbard was the first to produce such a book, entitled Ornamentc
Waterfowl , which was published in 1888, with a second edition ii
1907. After an interval of a quarter of a century A. F. Moody's boo,
on Waterfowl and Game Birds in Captivity appeared in 1932, and this wa
followed in 1933 by J. C. Laidley's comprehensive work on The Car
and Propagation of Ornamental Waterfowl. Unfortunately all these book
have been out of print for some time and are most difficult to obtain
so that those who wish to start a collection of waterfowl have been a
a great disadvantage. The appearance of the book under review i
therefore particularly welcome and the authors have dealt with thei

ibject in a straightforward and simple manner which will be of
articular use to those wishing to make a beginning in this
scinating branch of aviculture. The first chapter is on starting a
Election and contains a list of some of the more attractive and less
cpensive ducks which are particularly suitable for beginners. The
cond deals with fencing, planting, and pond construction, and the
Dok continues with chapters on general management of the collection,
ssts and eggs, hatching and rearing, plumage and moults, and ail-
ients and diseases. Then follow descriptions of some native and exotic
ucks and the geese and swans.
The necessity of making sure, by actual observation, that the
ucklings are eating is pointed out, but the authors do not give in-
.rmation, as does Mr. Laidley, on methods of ensuring that the young
irds do take food.
Emphasis is laid on the importance of winning the complete con-
dence of ducks and geese from the start and the great value of always
dking to the birds when feeding or walking among them. That the
athors carry out what they preach is shown by the instance quoted
&apos; a wild White-fronted Goose belonging to one of them which ate
read from the hand within six weeks of being captured, and which
ow likes to travel about sitting in the front seat of a motor-car.
The fact that each time there has been a special Waterfowl number
if the Magazine the issue has sold out is evidence of the great interest
lere is in this group of birds and this latest book should therefore be
i great demand. As the authors state : " There is, in fact, no reason
: all that anyone who is interested in waterfowl should not keep at
ast a pair or two even if they have only the smallest of gardens or
othing more than a backyard."

Though as the author, who is Curator of the Department of

troduction, the scope of this book is approximately indicated by its
tie, it has been necessary to establish a rather precise boundary
ong the southern perimeter to serve as a threshold in determining
hat forms to include or exclude. Accordingly the boundary has
ien established as a line running along the treeless coasts of Yukon
rritory and Mackenzie District east to Bathurst inlet and thence
uth-eastward to Eskimo Point on Hudson Bay, across that Bay to
artland Promontory on the east coast ; thence eastward to Ungava
ay and along its treeless coast to Cape Chidley. All species known to

In describing the nature of Arctic birds the author points out tha
it is not correct to assume that they are exceptionally hardy. He state
that among the more relentless factors enforcing adjustment amoni
Arctic birds is time, especially for migrants, and there is an urgenc 1
in courtship, laying, incubation, and growth of young. He als&lt;
points out that the Arctic is stern and insistent, discouraging th&lt;
development of frills and non-essentials such as crests, wattles, spangles
and complicated rituals, and Arctic birds are plain and unembellished
In describing the nature of Arctic bird populations he states tha
the best established generality is that they are notoriously unstabL
as to numbers and much of the instability is attributable to weather
The Arctic has been virtually unavailable to birds of arboreal habi
and nearly half belong to one Order the Charadriiformes.
Attention is drawn to the fact that the knowledge of Arctic bird
is very meagre and a number of points requiring detailed study an
outlined. A key to the Orders of Canadian Arctic birds is given
followed by a section on habitat as an aid to identification. The mail
part of the book is devoted to accounts of seventy-two species of tei
different Orders, which include status, habitat, and characteristics
with map. Additional names have been selected from the literatun
to include those which may be in use locally in the North, and Eskimt
names for particular regions are given. In many cases there an

I think this may be the first time that yellow Masked Lovebirds have been bred
l this country. There is perhaps some doubt as to whether they are in fact pure
tasked Lovebirds. John Yealland, when he saw mine, expressed the view that
ley had Peach-faced Lovebird blood in them. However, contrary to the expressed
pinions of more knowledgeable aviculturists, I still think that they are a delightful
lutation, and I see no reason why in time by careful selection they should not be
red completely yellow with the very attractive bronze face. I have seen a con-
derable number of this mutation, and they vary in the intensity and clarity of
ie colour considerably. The pair which I have bred this year are very attractive.
A newly-imported pair of Turquoisines are at the moment sitting on five eggs.

ESTING OF PlLEATED JAYS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983049586956522" page_id="58073451"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
My pair of Pileated Jays fortunately went to nest in mid-July, 1956, in a small
nary 12 feet by 4 feet, the shelter being 4 feet by 4 feet.
As they seemed to be playing around with nesting material and stripping the
irious growing plants and creepers in their aviary, I put an old Magpie nest in the
lelter, never thinking that they would breed, but with the object of giving the plants
chance by diverting their attention. Great was my surprise two days after placing
ie nest to find an egg, not unlike that of our Magpie, in it. Two more eggs followed in
ie course of the next four days. The hen seemed to do all the sitting. In fact I never
w her off the nest, and the cock fed her. On the sixteenth day one youngster was
itched. When I looked about four days later the three eggs had hatched. Both
rds appear model parents, but the cock did all the feeding. On collecting meal-
orms or maggots he would first feed the hen. She would then raise herself and the
&gt;ck would feed one of the youngsters ; he would repeat this until all were fed.
icidentally, I was not standing in the aviary shelter while this was taking place ;
teir aviary was one of a range, and I could observe this from a small passage dividing
ieir shelter from the next.
As at this time we were very busy on the land, I had not the time to collect beetles,
\0x25A0asshoppers, etc., of which they are very fond, so they had to make do on soft food
id fruit, with mealworms and maggots as the only live food. I think perhaps this is
ie cause of the failure to rear them. On the seventh day I found one of the babies
icked away in a bush in the flight. A couple of days later the second one was placed
the same spot. The last one was still alive and apparently lusty on the sixteenth
ly, but as I could hear no feeding noises on the eighteenth, I flushed the hen. This,
ie last hope, was dead, although there was food in its crop. Never having seen a
)ung Jay before, I couldn't really say, but my impression was that it was on the
inny side. The pair are nesting again now, so perhaps they will have better luck
lis time. They certainly deserve it, as both proved such good parents. As I have
id before, the only conclusion I can come to is that perhaps the cause of failure was
mething lacking in their diet. However, we will see what happens this time.

reeding Results at San Marino, 1957
Members may be interested to hear how some of my birds did this year. This
ason, after an unsuccessful attempt last year, I was able to rear one Black-chinned
uhina. Two young were hatched but one died. The survivor has been removed
om the " glasshouse aviary " to avoid the possibility of its being killed by the
irents. An interesting attempt was made by a Mountain Tanager male and a
ed-eared Tanager female. They built a nest in a spruce tree but as far as I know
) eggs were laid. As I am now out of the navy and will be back in Los Angeles
ixt year I am planning to remove these two Tanagers and give them a planted
nary to themselves. A hybrid from them should be a truly magnificient bird,
also reared five young Grey-headed X Brahminy Mynahs. I would like to state
at the Grey-headed X Pagoda Mynahs referred to in my article (page 47) were,
fact, the present cross. Brahminy Mynahs are often advertised as Pagoda Mynahs,
mce the confusion, but they are not the same.

I have seen the Green drink in the wild state, and had both Pied and Green drink
in captivity.
I have not seen them drink whilst standing on the ground with open feet. Like all
the fruit pigeons they do not care for walking. The ones I had in captivity drank ofl
perches, the water being placed within reach. Birds in aviaries had overhanging
branches. They sidled down the branch until they could reach the water.
The common Bengal Green I have seen settling in huge numbers on the lower
branches of a peepul tree ( Ficus religiosa ) until the branch touched water. Other
fruit pigeons more normally settle on dead branches sticking out of the water. The
Green Imperial are, of course, tree-top dwellers and very rarely come down to the
ground. I should think they would get plenty of water, high up, which had been
caught in broken branches. If my memory does not fail me these pigeons drank at
dawn and dusk. I succeeded in breeding the Green while in Calcutta.
Stuart Baker mentions that some natives believe the Green Pigeon only comes
down to drink where no perches are available, if it has a branch clasped in its feet.
I have been told this by villagers in Bengal.

This summer we were fortunate in breeding three young Crimson (Blood) Finches
{Neochmia phaeton). The parents nested in a covered flight, producing five eggs,
the first about the 19th July. The young were hatched on 5th August, and three
left the nest on the 25th and 26th August. A fourth was found dead at a very early
age, and one egg was broken. We separated the young from their parents on the
12 th September, as the first egg of a second round was laid on that day, and the
young were being prevented from returning to the nest, which was usual until then.
The three young are very fit indeed at time of writing (25th September), are medium
brown in colour, slight crimson diffusion over back and wings, crimson tail, underside
brown, flight-feathers dark brown, belly and thighs light brown, beak black.
The birds were very insectivorous, being fed gentles, once or twice ant eggs, and
some mealworms, with plenty of chickweed and home-made sponge cake. Ideal
parents, with the cock doing most of the incubation and much of the feeding.

A DIRECTORY OF BIRD RINGING
A world-wide directory of bird ringing is proposed to be published by The Ring,
an international ornithological bulletin devoted entirely to bird ringing and bird
migration studies. The avicultural rings will be included in this directory besides
the rings of ornithological schemes, carrier pigeon associations, etc.
I should be most grateful if readers of the Avicultural Magazine could assist
us by sending information and addresses--home and abroad--of all possible, even
the smallest institutions, organizations, clubs, businesses, and individuals issuing
their own rings for cage-birds. Samples of rings are essential, and would be greatly
appreciated.
All communications and information should be sent to The Ring, 1 Altyre Road.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
