REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1929
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99701959375" page_id="56215610"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
As the year is drawing to a close, we think we may look back and
congratulate ourselves that with this 1929 volume the Avicultural
Society has gone on increasing and progressing.
The Magazine, under our most able Editor, Mr. Seth-Smith,
maintains its high standard. We have had many interesting articles
illustrated with photographs, and have published eight coloured
plates.
Our affiliated members of Australasia have made a good start and
are increasing in numbers, in spite of many disadvantages they have
to contend with in the way of prohibition of importation.
At the commencement of the year the American Avicultural Society
was formed, with its magazine Aviculture, and we have allowed them
the use of some of the plates that have appeared in our Magazine.
We beg to extend our very hearty thanks to all who have
contributed to our welfare. Especially we would like to mention
Mr. Spedan Lewis for the gift of two plates; Mr. Newman for kindly
lending us four paintings by the late Mr. G-oodchild of Doves for
reproduction, also for his services in managing the advertisement
and exchange column; Mr. Howitt Lodge for the use of a painting,
and Mr. Hicks for conducting the post-mortem examinations.
Mr. and Mrs. Ezra, as in former years, again invited the members to
Foxwarren Park to see the splendid collection of birds. The weather was
ideal and a most enjoyable afternoon was spent and greatly appreciated
by all. The experiment was tried in July of holding a meeting, at which
papers were read and lantern slides were shown. This was well attended
and proved a great success. We beg to tender our best thanks to the
Zoological Society, who lent us their lecture hall for the occasion.
The Council would like to remind members that all subscriptions
are due on 1st January, and that this applies to new members who
have joined during the year as well as to old members.
Members on paying are supplied with the back numbers of the
Magazine from the previous January.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish, such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a &amp;apos;permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species ,
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient] for rearing the young of [name of
species], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

By T. H. Newman
The Bronze-winged Pigeons are all most attractive and desirable
aviary birds, their wonderful jewelled-like wings reflecting the light
in ever-changing colours, and, as they are mostly birds of fair size and
much given to spending their time on the ground, they catch the eye
of those who are not generally interested in birds. Of all the species
none is finer than the so-called Common Bronze-wing (Phaps
chalcojptera ). If it were a very scarce species I believe it would be as
eagerly sought after and valued as, say, a Bird of Paradise. Not only
are they most beautiful, but they are gentle (very amiable for a Pigeon),
good breeders, and very hardy and easy to cater for. Perhaps the fact
that they have been easy to obtain in the past has made us not value
them as we should : but now that the Australian Government has
forbidden the exportation of the native birds, unless by special permit,
we ought to most carefully preserve our stock and try to rear as many
young birds as possible, and I would suggest that young birds should be
exchanged so as to introduce fresh blood, and so carry on for years
with perhaps the help of an occasional imported bird. The wonderful
results in colour-breeding obtained by intensive culture in that other

T. H. Newman--The Bronze-winged Pigeon
Australian bird, the Budgerigar, show what can be done by careful
selection ; so who knows what might result from starting with such a
magnificent species as the Bronze-winged Pigeon ?
This bird used to be very common in the interior, but like many
other species does not now seem to be met with in such numbers, though
it is still probably the best known Pigeon in Australia, being found
throughout the Continent and also in Tasmania. It seeks its food on the
ground, and in addition to seeds and grain a certain amount of insect
food seems to be taken. I have seen them eagerly devouring earth-
worms in captivity. The best account of its wild habits has been given
us by A. J. Campbell in his Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, where he
tells us that the manner of coming to drink of this Pigeon differs from
other species, as the birds in the evening (and a few in the morning)
fly to within fifty yards of water and then walk to the edge, drink and
walk away a few yards before flying away. They would also nest in
company, a story being told of a dozen pairs suddenly appearing and
establishing themselves on a low-bushed, scrubby ridge, where they
were protected and grew comparatively tame ; they nested and hatched
their young, but just as they were getting on nicely a flock of Crows
appeared and killed and devoured every nestling. A great variety of
situations have been made use of by this Pigeon, the nest being some-
times as high as 25 feet from the ground, and at other times even placed
on the ground ; but usually the slight platform of twigs is placed in a
fork of a horizontal limb of a low tree or on a bushy branch at no great
distance from the ground, while a stump is not infrequently made use
of and a hollow spout of a gum-tree may be used. The natural nesting
season lasts from about August to the end of the year. When first
imported they are apt to be rather wild, but they soon settle down and
adapt themselves to our seasons. Several nests may be made during
the year, and Bronze-wings generally prove to be good parents, looking
well after their young and not neglecting them when they leave the
nest, as so many Doves and Pigeons often do. They do well on the usual
larger seeds and grain supplied to Pigeons, and are fond of cut-up pea-
nuts, and will eat some of the soft fruits such as the wine-berry. Pigeons
as a family are easy birds to hybridize, and the Common Bronze-winged
Pigeon will readily mate with the allied Brush Bronze-wing. In 1912

and 1913 I reared about half a dozen fine birds from a cock Brush
mated with a hen Common. The hybrids were very beautiful ; I had
birds of both sexes, and shortly afterwards young were reared in the
London Zoological Gardens from a cock Common mated to a hen
Brush Bronze-wing. I had hoped to get one of these birds to compare
with and mate with one of mine, but the war upset this and other plans.
The coloured plate, a study of the living birds and one of the late Mr. H.
Goodchild's most beautiful drawings, makes a description unnecessary.
Individuals vary much in the colour of the metallic spots on the wings,
one hen bird that I had had them bronzy-green and in another of the
same sex they were fiery-red. The young are dark brown with lighter
edges to the feathers, the light stripe above, and particularly
below and behind the eye, is very distinct; and the young cock can
be distinguished whilst still in the nest by his buff forehead. The metallic
spots appear when the bird moults. The Common Bronze-wing has
been liberated at Woburn Abbey and ten were turned out in the London
Zoological Gardens as an experiment when some Crested Bronze-
wings were also allowed their liberty, but the birds soon disappeared
from this latter locality.

BREEDING OF THE ABYSSINIAN HELMETED

By G. H. Gurney, F.E.S.
During the past summer a number of interesting species nested in
the aviaries here, but in many cases the young were not reared. Perhaps
the most noteworthy event was the breeding of the fine Abyssinian
form of the Helmeted Guineafowl, Numida ptilorhyncha, which differs
very considerably from the two species found further south in Kenya
Colony, viz. Numida reichenowi and Numida meleagris major. Eleven
eggs were laid about the middle of July, and all hatched. Eight young
birds have been fully reared.
The eggs closely resembled those of the domestic Guineafowl,
but are smaller, paler in colour, with less rufous spotting, and the shell is

not so hard. The chicks are most beautiful little objects, covered with
rich red brown fluff, the head conspicuously striped with dark brown
and white ; this striping remains till the birds are nearly adult, and even
after they have moulted once, and have their full spotted plumage,
they still retain this marked characteristic. They grew very quickly
after the first week, but I found required an enormous amount of
exercise, roaming over a large extent of ground. They were reared on
Pheasant's food and plenty of ants' eggs. My pair of Yulturine Guinea-
fowls laid three eggs only, in a manger, the very slight nest being made
of hay. Two eggs hatched, and the young have been reared ; they
closely resembled N. ptilorhyncha till they were six weeks or nearly
two months old, when the characteristic Yulturine feathers began to
appear, the long hackles on the neck, the patch of self-coloured breast
feathers, and the longer, more elongated shape of the body began to
be noticeable. The Yulturine Guineafowl has, I believe, been bred more
than once in captivity, but I am not sure if the other species ever has.
A pair of Kazor-billed Curassows nested high up on the lid of a
hamper, in the back of a shed. These birds, like the Guineafowls,
have practically complete liberty, and constantly fly across into an
adjacent wood, always returning, however, to be fed ; one would
rather have expected them to have nested in one of the trees in the
wood, which has much thick undergrowth and appears very suitable.
Two large white eggs were laid, very rough in texture. The hen alone
sat steadily for six weeks, only coming off to feed, and after that, of
her own accord, gave it up as a bad job ; both eggs, on examination,
proved to be infertile. These Curassows are almost as tame as
Trumpeters ; when noticed or spoken to, they have a curious habit of
shaking their heads more or less continuously; at first I thought they
must have something the matter with them, but it appears to be a
natural habit, and some Guans which I have do the same thing, though
not to such an extent.
Occipital Tree Pies nested and laid two, or possibly three eggs,
but ate them after sitting a week. They were probably not kept
sufficiently quiet. My pair of San Bias Jays nested no less than three
times during the summer, always in the same place, a large box bush
in the flight of their aviary. Four, three, and three eggs were respectively

laid, each clutch being richer in colour and more spotted than the
last; the eggs of the first clutch were white with a faint pink tinge,
increasing in depth at the larger end, the brown spots were pale and
very inconspicuous; in the second clutch of three eggs, the spots were
larger and more deeply coloured, while in the last clutch the eggs were
of a beautiful pinky tinge all over, well covered with different sized
spots of a rich purple-brown. All these clutches hatched, but in every
case the young were eaten by the old birds : the first lot when they were
only a few days old, in the second brood one nestling was eaten on the
second or third day, but the remaining two survived till they were
eight days old, when they too suffered the same fate ; the third lot
of young were almost fledged, well covered with feathers, and we had
dared to begin to hope that they would escape the fate of their brothers
and sisters, but one morning, when the attendant first visited them,
he found one being actually devoured by its parent, and no signs of
the others. The old birds had been given as many mice and Sparrows
as they could eat, and were most attentive parents, till the fatal
fascination of murdering their offspring was too much for them. They
were the sole occupants of their aviary, save for a pair of African Plovers,
and I do not think they paid any attention to these, as they had been
there a long while and were quite used to each other.
Buff-backed Herons made two nests on hamper lids in the Waders 5
aviary, but in both cases they were disturbed by Ibises ; another year
I must try and remove the latter, as I fancy the Herons would have
laid, and it is not often that members of this family are bred. Rheas
made no attempt at laying this year, the first summer I have had no
young Rheas since I first kept them, twelve or fifteen years ago,
though not the same individuals.
A few Ducks were bred, mainly Carolinas ; I never quite understand
why more do not nest here, as although the piece of water is small,
and possibly overcrowded with Ducks, they can wander through
shrubs and bushes a very long way, and have plenty of scope for
breeding.
Royal Starlings carried quantities of nesting materials into a hollow
log, but got no further ; in one of my pair, the entire plumage, which
is normally yellow, has become creamy white colour; I have never seen

another example of this species at all like it. Australian Crested Doves
bred freely and Diamond Doves reared several young.
Two Nyasaland Lovebirds were reared, and a good many Bengalese
Finches. Spotted Francolins nested twice ; the first eggs were infertile ;
of the second clutch, three were hatched but died after two or three
days, I think from cold and damp weather. My pair of Plumed Jays,
Calocitta formosa, an account of which has appeared in the Magazine,
disappointed me by showing no signs of wanting to go to nest. Two
Ducks, my old porcupine, and a cow killed themselves by eating
green acorns.

BREEDING NOTES FROM THE LILFORD

By A. F. Moody
By permission of the Lady Lilford and as . of possible interest
to aviculturists, I give a few particulars of the breeding season of 1928
amongst the birds at Lilford. Firstly, although about fifty aviaries
and enclosures are tenanted by something like 300 birds of perhaps
100 species (chiefly the larger), many in fact the greater number, owing
to the retention of old favourites and broken pairs, are non-breeders.
Also the great number of visitors to the aviaries during the summer
months is much against breeding and deprives the birds of that quiet
so essential to success with many species. 1 Misfortunes too, common
to aviculturists, are not unknown at Lilford. Our first of the nesting
season, and rather an extraordinary one, occurred in March. A female
Upland Goose which had been sitting steadily nearly a month under a
lilac bush, being disturbed during the night by rats or other vermin,
and in her efforts to protect the eggs or to defend herself, had jumped
into the air and caught the shoulder of her unpinioned wing in a fork of
the lilac. Suspended in the air, her toes just touching the ground, the

etc., on any afternoon in the week except Sundays, during April, May, June,

eggs broken and scattered, the poor bird was found in the morning
utterly exhausted and was only eventually nursed back to health and
beauty by the greatest care and the subsequent removal of the twisted
joint.
Another tragedy in April was the early demise of two little White -
necked Crane chicks, apparently from gapes. A minor one, a well-
grown Horsfield's Pheasant chick (the only one hatched) being decapi-
tated by a pair of breeding Conures. A fourth, the refusal of a pair of
Spreo Starlings to further feed their young ; whilst amongst other
disappointments may be mentioned the failure of two clutches of
North American Wild Turkeys' eggs to hatch, the complete disappear-
ance of several newly hatched Gurganey down a mouse run, burrowed
beneath the sitting hen, also two full broods of Lesser Scaup reared
turning out to be worthless hybrids between a female of that species
and a male Common Pochard. Amongst our very few successes may
be recorded the rearing of a later clutch of two White-naped Cranes
(Grus leucauchen). The only departure from our usual procedure in
this instance (they rear here annually) being that, as an experiment,
one egg was taken from the parents a few hours before hatching and
placed under a domestic fowl. A chick duly appeared and much puzzled
its foster mother, a steady Rhode Island Red, who looked at it critically
and I suppose thought " What next ? " The only difficulty in the rearing
of this bird was that for the first day or two it expected food from the
bill and persisted in pecking at the red comb of the hen. This was
overcome by offering food (fragments of meat, etc.) from the fingers,
when it soon learned to pick up, grew rapidly, and until grown kept
considerably in advance of its brother or sister chick reared by the
parents. As of possible interest I may add that the first white neck
feather of this bird appeared on the eighty-fifth day, and that at the
time of writing, 16th November, the lower half of the white neck strip
of both birds is complete and the general plumage a mixture of steel
and fawn. This sturdy little youngster is very tame, rather given to
artificial behaviour, and, in the writer's opinion, just lacks that charm
and interest attached to the natural bird.
Other birds nesting were a pair of European Egle Owls, a Common
Redshank, which sat steadily upon infertile eggs, Gold, Amherst

unattached female Monaul, a Red-throated Guan, Cornish and Alpine
Choughs produced eggs, as did also two female Hutchin's Geese.
A pair of Ring-necked Parrakeets, confined in an aviary, reared their
annual quota of three young, as did others at liberty in the woods.
As in preceding years, two young Jenday's Conures were reared
from a pair which started in 1926. One young bird of that year, bred
at liberty, still stays about with the Ring-necks, comes up to feed twice
daily, and can readily be distinguished at a considerable distance when
flying by its more rapid wing beats or Cuckoo-like flight.
Of Waterfowl 38 species of Duck (some not established) are at
present living in the collection. Of these about 20 species nested,
resulting in 69 young being hatched and 67 reared. These include
American, Common and Chiloe Wigeon, Falcated Duck, Pochard,
Tufted, American Red-head, Indian and Japanese Spotbill, Rosy-bill,
Shoveller, Lesser Scaup (hybrids), three Mallards, and a full brood of
eight Canvas Backs. Of the latter rather uncommon species in confine-
ment, five eggs were laid in a nest and three dropped. Incubation
under a fowl lasted twenty-six days, the young proving quite as easy
to rear as the young of its near relative, the Common Pochard.

SOME NOTES ON THE GOLDEN-BACKED
HANGING PARROT
</sectionHeader>

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Late last spring, through the kindness of a fellow-member, I was
given the opportunity of acquiring a pair of this rare and lovely little
Parrot which I had coveted since seeing a single male at the Zoological
Gardens. The Golden-backed is large, as Hanging Parrots go, being
about the size of a Peach-faced Lovebird. The cock is a rich green,
slightly paler on the breast. The rump and forehead are red and there
is a large patch of orange-red of an unusual and very lovely shade on
the throat. Down the back of the head and neck, from the fore-part of

the crown to the shoulders, runs a strip of golden yellow merging into
golden brown in the centre of the mantle. The bill is orange-red and
very long, slender and delicately curved, and the feet are reddish. The
hen lacks the orange-red throat patch, her throat having a bluish
tinge, and the golden strip on the head and neck is duller and more ill-
defined. As the birds were in good condition on arrival and the weather
warm, I turned them straight into one of my large movable aviaries,
where, up to the present, they have done well, a good-sized petrol heater
being employed, since the cold weather began, to raise the temperature
of the shelter to a comfortable warmth.
The birds have been fed mainly on Sunbird mixture--Horlick's
milk, honey, and Mellin's food, and are extremely fond of a good dessert
apple, eating a considerable quantity. Since moulting they have come
into lovely plumage, and I succeeded in winning a first prize with them
at the recent Paignton show.
For a time I kept a Superb Tanager with the Hanging Parrots, but
in the end I had to remove him as he started to bully them when he
got into good condition. It would appear, therefore, that the Golden-
backed Hanging Parrot resembles the Blue-crowned in being timid and
inoffensive where passerine birds are concerned. The cock Golden-
back spends a fair amount of time in the open flight, though he makes
good use of the shelter as well. He possesses quite a song---a
low whispering and chittering with an occasional soft, sweet note
interspersed, the performance being kept up for some time as in the
case of a cock Budgerigar. His mate is more nervous or more warmth-
loving and nowadays seldom leaves the shelter. She is rather a shrewish
creature, refusing to tolerate her handsome partner near her, and if
in any way cornered by a human hand, making a terrific lunge, accom-
panied by an explosive screeching hiss. One can well imagine that in
snake-haunted lands such a means of defence would be very effective
for a sitting bird. Golden-backed Hanging Parrots, like other members
of the genus, are very subject to overgrown claws, and these need cutting
at intervals when the birds show signs of getting hung up on the wire-
netting. The Golden-backed Hanging Parrot is said to have hatched
young at the Zoological Gardens many years ago, so, if my pair survive
the winter, they may possibly breed.

ARRIVAL OF RARE BIRDS FROM THE EAST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97886175862069" page_id="56215664"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
Mr. Walter Goodfellow recently returned from a collecting trip
to the East on behalf of Mr. Spedan Lewis, and his collection contained
a number of rarities. Perhaps the most valuable were three examples
of Bulwer's Pheasant (Lobiophasis bidweri) from the mountain forests
of Sarawak. The male is a remarkable bird with the head almost naked,
bright blue in colour, and ornamented with three pairs of wattles. The
neck and chest are dark crimson, the body black with steel-blue
margins to the feathers, the tail being pure white.
The collection contained five examples of a very handsome White
Grackle, which proves to be Kothschild's Grackle Leucopsar rothschildi
from the island of Bali. It is pure white with a full crest, black primaries
and end of tail. The skin surrounding the eyes is bare of feathers and
blue in colour. The species was described by Herr Stresemann so
recently as in 1912, and it was figured in the Novitates Zoological
(xix, 1912-13).
Mr. Spedan Lewis has presented to the Zoological Society several
very rare birds from this collection, of which the following are new to
the Zoo list: Helmeted Hornbill, Rhinoplax vigil ; Javan Hornbill,
Buceros sylvestris ; Fire-tufted Barbet, Psilopogon pyrolophus ; Crow-
billed Barbet, Chotorhea corvina ; Green Broadbill, Calyptomena viridis ;
Bufous-vented Babbler, Malacocincla rufiventris. The Hornbills are
quite young, but will be splendid birds when adult. The Fire-tufted
Barbet is a most handsome and attractive bird which Mr. Delacour
tells me has been already imported into France, though I believe this is
the first to be brought to England. It is green with grey cheeks, a yellow,
followed by a black band on the chest; a tuft of fiery-red tipped
bristles above the bill, which is of a greenish colour with a blackish
band across it. The forehead is black, followed by a greyish patch, and
the crown is reddish brown. This bird occurs.in the mountain ranges of

By J. Delacour
In this article I propose to include those sea birds having webbed
feet which feed on fish and garbage cast up on the shore or floating
on the waves. They comprise several families with very diverse
characteristics : Skuas, Gulls, Petrels, and Albatrosses.
Skuas
The Skuas or Robber-Gulls (Stercorariidce) are large brown Gulls
which feed mostly by robbing other Gulls of fish which they have already
swallowed and which they oblige them to disgorge ; they also devour
the eggs and young of other birds. They are very dangerous in con-
finement, attacking and killing birds of their own size. In addition
to this they have nothing to recommend them to aviculturists and are
hardly ever met with except in zoological gardens, where the following
species have been shown : Stercorarius skua, S. chilensis, S. antarctica,
S. pomatorhinus, S. crepidatus , S. parasiticus, S. lonnbergi. They are
long-lived and thrive on a diet of meat and fish.
Gulls
Gulls are well known to everybody and are common on many coasts
and often far inland, except in Polynesia. Nearly all are white,
occasionally faintly rose-coloured, with dark or pale grey mantles ;
some have black heads and others have grey under-parts as well.
Gulls feed on fish and all kinds of refuse thrown into the sea ; when
on land they eat worms, insects, and small animals, very much after the
fashion of Crows. The large species consume quantities of the eggs,
young, and even adults of weaker birds.
They are hardy in confinement, intelligent, tame, and amusing. As

a rule they are pinioned and allowed to run loose in the garden, where
they find a variety of food which should be supplemented by bread,
scraps of meat, and fish. But so their graceful flight cannot be enjoyed
and only in zoological gardens are the aviaries sufficiently vast to allow
them to sport and fly at their ease. They breed readily whenever
conditions are favourable. Of course it will readily be understood
that they must not be kept along with weaker birds, to whom they would
be exceedingly dangerous.
Nearly all species of the genus Larus , about forty-five, have been
imported or kept in confinement, so that it is unnecessary to enumerate
them, particularly as they all have very much the same colouring,
the chief difference being size and the colour of the mantle, which varies
from white to dark grey, almost black ; their heads, which may or may
not wear a black hood, and the colour of their legs or bill. A great
many have bred and hybrids even have been known. Their near
relations, Gabianus , Leucophoeus, Pagophila, and Rissa, genera which
consist of only one species each, have likewise figured in collections.
Terns
Terns are, generally speaking, of much the same colour as Gulls,
chiefly grey and white ; they are smaller and their bills are long and
straight, their legs very short, wings particularly long, and their tails
forked. For these reasons they are sometimes called Sea Swallows.
They are poor runners, but fly well and are most at home in the air.
They can swim, but not long distances.
They feed on small fish swimming near the surface of the watdr,
and which they catch by diving, and insects which they catch on the
wing. Terns are found all over the world, most are migratory and
frequent both salt and fresh water. Terns can be kept in confinement;
if taken young they can be tamed sufficiently to be allowed their
freedom ; they fly round and return to their owner. They are not
suitable for keeping in aviaries except by people who are specially
interested in this kind of bird, as their beauty lies in their flight. They
should be given an insectivorous mixture, fish, and insects.
Nearly all the indigenous species have been tried ( Hydrochelidon
nigra, Gelochelidon anglica , Hydroprogne caspia , Sterna fluviatilis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999070888888889" page_id="56215669"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
The Albatrosses are large birds inhabiting tropical seas, par-
ticularly round Australia, having very long narrow wings and extra-
ordinary powers of flight. They have very strong hooked beaks and
their nostrils are cased in a kind of sheath. They are found on the high
seas and make long voyages. Their food consists of floating molluscs
and any kind of garbage. Their gait on land is faltering and grotesque.
Although several species ( Diomedea exulans , D. melcmophrys, D.
irrorata, etc.) have been shown in zoological gardens, they are not
suitable subjects. They are birds which should be left to fly at liberty.

Petrels (Procellariidce) have beaks like miniature Albatrosses, and
they also are birds of the open sea. The large species resemble Gulls,
but the smaller are grey or brown. They spend all their time flying
and are not suitable to be kept in confinement. Their food consists
of all kinds of small marine creatures and a kind of oil is found in their
stomachs. Attempts have been made to keep most of the indigenous
species alive but without success, for they are in no wise suitable for
aviary life.

The different birds mentioned under this heading have little in
common save that they all dive for their food and are particularly
adapted to this mode of living.
They have short wings (in some species these have assumed the
function of fins), short strong legs, and webbed feet placed very far
back, which causes the birds, when on land, to assume an upright
attitude or to drag themselves along the ground. Nearly all have
seasonal changes of plumage.

Auks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973689676470588" page_id="56215670"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
Auks ( Alcidce ) inhabit the Northern Hemisphere ; they can all
fly although their wings are short, and they have webbed feet. An
extinct species, the Great Auk (Alca impennis), had such small wings
that it was unable to fly. Auks are all sea birds and nest gregariously
on rocky islands. They feed on small fish, worms, and molluscs. They
are frequently exhibited in zoological gardens, but do not live long and
are not really suited to confinement. All the European species, Razor-
bill, Guillemots Little Auk, and Puffin, have been exhibited and have
lived for a time in London, but they are difficult subjects. Where
possible they should be provided with salt water.
Penguins
Although superficially resembling the Auks the Penguins are in
reality very different. They take the place of Auks in the Antarctic,
but are still better adapted to marine life ; their wings have become
fin-like and their feathers have assumed a scaly appearance. Their
feet are webbed and very thick. They are gregarious. These birds
thrive much better in confinement than the Auks, and their comical
appearance, their boldness and absurd quarrels make them very
amusing to watch ; in fact, they rank among the greatest attractions of
zoological gardens.
They are fed on fish but should sometimes be hand fed ; it is a good
thing to give a pinch of iodine daily to each bird, concealed in a fish
head, unless they can be provided with sea water. Once acclimatized
they are long lived and are very ready to breed, generally in little
kennels or among stones. The late Mr. Astley tried putting some
Penguins on his ponds which were already stocked with water fowl,
but, although they proved quite harmless, the other birds were so
terrified by the dashing way in which they swam and dived that he
had to remove them.
The Cape oh Black-footed Penguin (Spheniscus demersus), a
black and white bird from South Africa, is by far the commonest in
confinement and is easily bred. S. humboldti from Chile, S. mendelius
from Galapagos, and S. mayellanicus from South America (ranging
from Chile to Brazil) ; Endyptula minor of Australia, Megadyptes

antipodum of New Zealand, and Pygoscelis papua , inhabiting the same
region and the Falkland and Kerguelen Isles, have all been exhibited
in zoological gardens.
The Rock-hopper Penguins (CatarrJiactes) have tufts of yellow
feathers at the sides of their heads. Three species out of four have been
imported : C. chrysocome from the Falkland Isles, Kerguelen, Australia,
etc., C. pachyrhynchus and C. sclateri from New Zealand.
The King Penguin ( Aptenodytes palagonica ) from islands to the
south is one of the most remarkable members of the family. It is a
large bird of strange appearance, with a slender bill, and plumage
richly variegated with brown, blue-grey, black, white, and yellow.
It has been bred several times in the Zoological Gardens of Edinburgh,
and has figured several times in large public collections in spite of its
rarity and costliness.
The still larger Emperor Penguin (A. forsteri) of the Antarctic
has never been imported.
Divers
Divers ( Colymbus ) are large birds with wings which, though short,
are capable of flight, straight, long pointed bills and webbed feet.
Their summer plumage is very handsome, having white and sometimes
russet markings on a bronzy black and grey ground. Out of the
breeding season they live at sea but come to lakes and ponds for breeding
purposes, and again during winter migration. They belong to the
Arctic regions.
They swim and dive with amazing rapidity and feed on fish. In
contrast to the Penguins, they are of solitary habits.
Their flight is heavy but swift; they can only drag themselves
along the ground and cannot stand up.
Divers live fairly well in confinement under natural conditions,
that is to say on a pond where fish are plentiful or where they can have
access to a large tank and are fed on fresh fish.
The three species which visit the temperate parts of Europe in
winter, namely the Great Northern, Black-throated, and Red-throated
Divers, have all been kept in collections.

Grebes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980846137931034" page_id="56215674"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
Grebes ( Podiceps ) are nearly related to the Divers but are much
smaller, have shorter beaks and curiously lobed feet. They often have
tufted heads and brown plumage, but they change their dress
according to the season.
They live only in fresh water and inhabit the temperate parts of
both hemispheres, emigrating to warmer regions at the approach
of winter.
They are purely water birds and one might say they are never seen
on dry land ; they fly heavily but with rapidity, swim and dive very
swiftly. They feed on small fish, insects, and other small organisms
which they take under water. They build floating nests among the
water weeds.
Grebes can easily be kept in confinement on small ponds providing
there is sufficient natural food. They may also be kept in aviaries
if large tanks are provided and filled with small fishes and
aquatic insects; they are harmless. The following species have been
kept: the Chestnut Grebe (P. rujicollis ), a very small species; the
Black-necked Grebe (C. nigricollis ) and the Eared Grebe (C. auritus),
two closely related species, black, with brown abdomen, sides, and rump,
and adorned on the head with two yellow tufts; the crested Grebe (P.
. cristatus), a large and handsome species with brown, black, and white
plumage, and a head to which the long side feathers and double crest
give a very distinct appearance ; the Bed-necked Grebe (P. griseigena ),
brown with russet neck and crested head black above, greyish white
beneath. Finally, the Giant Grebe of Cayenne ( Mchmophorus major )
has been imported. It is larger than the Crested Grebe with very
long beak and neck recalling the Divers, crestless, brown above and
whitish below, and the front of the neck, breast, and sides are rust
, colour.

A BUDGERIGAR TRAGEDY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950674" page_id="56215675"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --I have bred a good number of Budgerigars (green and yellow)
in an outdoor aviary during the past summer, the birds having done
very well. About three weeks ago I separated the sexes, putting all
the cocks in a large aviary cage, likewise the hens. All went well for
three days, when on looking at them the next morning a most ghastly
spectacle awaited me. Every cock bird (about ten) was terribly
mutilated, three or four were dead, the rest were minus eyes, toes,
even beaks, and the whole lot were a mass of congealed blood. Only
one survived. The hens in another large cage were all perfectly sound.
Is this not rather unusual ? Have any of our members had a similar
experience ? My own opinion is that there must have been one young
hen amongst the cock birds, and so caused the terrible fighting which
had occurred. (It was not possible for anything to have got into the
cage.) I hardly feel so enthusiastic over Budgerigars as I was before
I witnessed this horrible sight !
Evelyn Dennis.
[Is it quite certain that it was not a rat ? We have known cases
where rats have attacked from the outside of the cage, the frightened
birds being seized as they clung on to the wires, and legs, wings, or
beaks being bitten off.-- Ed.]

Sir,--I can corroborate Captain Hamilton Scott's observations
on Cuckoos feeding on Gooseberry Saw-fly larvae. Some years ago I
reared a young Cockoo by hand largely on these larvae from our own
and our neighbours' gardens. The bird took these eagerly, as
well as those of the Buff-tip moth, which are usually avoided by
insectivorous birds, and throve on them. When it grew old enough
I taught it to feed itself by putting it under gooseberry and currant
bushes infested by the Saw-fly larvae.
It was almost the tamest bird I ever reared, and its death brought
on by a chill owing to neglect while I was away on a visit, was a great
disappointment.

CHANGE OF PLUMAGE IN SNOWY OWL

Sir, --The Snowy Owls at the Zoo to which I alluded in the
Avicultural Magazine for 1927 (p. 200) have now all moulted again ;
the largest, which is presumably a hen, having practically reproduced
the heavily-barred plumage which all of them had when first received,
thus bearing out the commonly-received idea that the female in this
species takes longer to turn white than the male. Of the other three,
two are now much whiter, but not so white as the third, which has
been the longest in the gardens, and, as I remarked, became white at
its first moult there. One of these two is nearly as fully marked as before,
but has the actual markings so much reduced in size that it looks far
more white than dark ; the other is nearly all white except for a band
of small markings across the breast. It is clear that the white dress
in males is assumed long before old age sets in.

Sir, --It may interest some of your readers to know that before my
letter appeared in the October number my Zebra Doves had at last
successfully brought off their two young which are now as strong
as their parents, but of a much browner colour or rather brownish-grey
instead of the blue-grey of the adult birds.
I attribute my success to the change of feeding ; I gave the doves
a constant supply of Indian Millet, a daily supply of Secto mixed with
biscuit meal which was slightly moistened to a crumbly consistency,
to which I added a good allowance of ordinary loaf bread, crumbled up.
This latter the Doves all seem very fond of, especially when nesting.
I have found that all my Doves are very fond of coarse, I think it is called
No. 2, biscuit meal quite dry. They all eat a lot of it and it seems very
good for them. Next year I will certainly follow our Editor's good advice
for both these and my Senegal Doves and put plenty of small twigs
round their nests.

Sir, --About a fortnight ago, believing that they had finished
breeding, I caught up all my hen Firefinches and put them in an aviary
with the young birds bred at liberty. I also made the usual winter
arrangements for shutting the cocks up at night, but one succeeded
in finding his way out again through the inward-pointing wire funnel
and continued to roost in the garden. The day before yesterday to my
great surprise he appeared with three young ones which he must have
attended to for some time single-handed. Two, at least, were still alive
this morning in spite of a severe frost, and I have great hopes of catching
them up. Until recently the weather has, of course, been extraordinarily
mild, but even so it is rather remarkable that in spite of the long nights
and the absence of his mate the little tropical Finch should have
acomplished his difficult task successfully.

IMPORTATION OF RARE BIRDS

Sir, --In these days when, through the agency of numerous enter-
prising importers, we receive into this country so many rare and
wonderful birds from every quarter of the globe it is greatly to be
regretted that when these birds reach the aviaries of the fortunate
aviculturists who can afford them, we hear no more about them. I am
sure that with this great influx of rare birds during this last three years
or so there must be hundreds of exceedingly interesting birds in this
country of which we hear nothing. In the earliest numbers of the
Magazine there was a series of articles every month entitled " Rare
Foreign Birds " to which members contributed a short note on any
rare or unusual bird which they received. Could not this be revived
again, because lam sure that members who fight shy of sending long&amp;apos;
articles either owing to lack of time or limited literary capacity would
be glad to send just a short note.
During this last twelve months I have known of many extremely
rare birds being brought to this country, Lories, Pittas, Tanagers,
Sunbirds, and rare Australian Parrakeets, bnt once landed they were
never heard of again, Even if members would only notify us of the

arrival of such birds through the columns of the Magazine it would be
of great interest.
Many birds have been imported of which nothing is known in the
wild state and any notes of their behaviour in captivity would be of
great scientific interest, it would also be of great assistance to future
generations to know what species have been imported.

ABNORMAL CARDINALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993303545454545" page_id="56215678"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I was interested to read in the October journal, Mr. de
Southoff's remarks on abnormally coloured Cardinals. I possessed two
such abormally coloured birds as those he described. They were bred
in my aviary in 1913. On turning up my notes of that time I find the
following : " Abnormal colouring of young Red Crested Cardinals.
Entire breast and under parts deep slatey grey, slightly paler under
tail; crest and throat snuff-brown as in normal nestlings, neck, back
and upper parts dark slatey grey ; tail and flight feathers black. There
was an entire absence of the usual white on the breast, under parts,
and sides of neck, which gave the birds a decidedly sooty appearance.
There were two of these strangely coloured youngsters in a nest of
three--the third being a bird of normal colour. Neither of the two
dark ones were so vigorous as the other and both died in December,
being then months old. The normal young one showed some red
feathers on the head in November, but neither of the others showed any
change of colour at all. It was unfortunate that they both died, as it
would have been interesting to have seen whether they would eventually
have assumed the normal plumage of the species, or retained their
dark colouring."
I have since bred quite a number of young Red-Crests, but the two
birds described above were the only ones that showed any variation.

to hold the greatest foreign bird exhibition of the year. The hall in
which the foreign birds are placed has most of the drawbacks of the
infernal regions without the compensating advantage of heat. A chilly
gloom, feebly relieved by artificial light, is unfair both to the birds and
to their owners. It does not show the beauty of the birds' colouring
to anything like full advantage, and it exposes the more delicate
exhibits to grave risk of chill. Many of my very best birds have never
been showm at the Palace and never will be, for the simple reason that
I do not dream of sending there anything that I mind losing which does
not come straight from an outdoor aviary. In making these criticisms
I do not wish to throw any aspersions either on the Show Secretary
or on the Crystal Palace management; both do their best with the
accommodation available. What it simply comes to is this : that huge
glass buildings like the Crystal Palace or Olympia are quite unsuited to
the exhibition of foreign birds in cold weather.
With regard to a practical alternative suggestion, I must confess
I am not so well equipped as a critic should be. It does occur to me,
however, that it might be possible on the same date as the Canary
and British Bird Show at the Palace to hold a show for foreign birds
only in some suitable and accessible London hall.

FRENCH AVICULTURAL MEDALS

Sir, --The Council of La Societe Nationale d'Acclimatation de
France has awarded silver medals to Dr. M. Amsler for breeding the
Hermit Thrush (Hylocichla guttata) ; and to Mr. H. Moore for hybrids
between the Black-cheeked Lovebird (A. nigrigenis) and the Masked
Lovebird (A. per sonata). Each of these two successes is the first of its
kind recorded in Europe.
In connection with the granting of breeding medals a new rule
has come into force, to the effect that henceforth medals will not be
awarded for the breeding of hybrids, or for those sub-species of which
an allied form has previously been bred.
The Executive Committee of the Avicultural Society does not, of
course, award medals for the re?ring of hybrids.

HYBRID LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992071416666667" page_id="56215680"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- I have been honoured by the award of the silver medal of
the Societe Rationale d'Acclimatation de France for my hybrids
A. nigrigenis X A. per sonata, but I question whether produce from
parents so closely allied should be classed as hybrids at all. The various
African Lovebirds reproduce so easily that it is clear they are basically
of the same species. Further, some of these Lovebird hybrids (sic)
have reproduced, a sure sign that their parents were closely allied in
blood ties. If a greyhound crosses with a bulldog no one would dream
of classing them as hybrids, they would be termed mongrels or crosses.
Has this question of the limitation of the term hybrid been discussed
previously by our Society of which I am but a new and humble member ?

Sir, --If members would write to the Magazine more freely about
such simple matters as the letter of Mr. H. L. Sich on the breeding of
Bengalese in the October number of our Magazine refers to, it would, I
am sure, be helpful to many of us.
I bred from a pair of Bengalese this year. I did not expect much
from them, because it was only towards the end of the season that I had
a big cage to spare for them. I got only three eggs : two hatched and
one egg was infertile, but the two young were reared by the parent
birds in the most exemplary manner. I used a wicker Hartz Mountain
Canary cage for the nest. Mr. Sich does not tell us the nesting receptacle
he used. Perhaps that was at fault. My hen Bengalese seemed to sit
from the day the first egg was hatched. Perhaps this accounts for the
difference in the size of the young and the substitution of dummy
eggs till the last of the clutch is laid might help to solve the problem.
In any case these little birds are reputed to breed so freely and
would be of such value as foster parents that it is, I think, well worth
an effort on the part of our members to solve the problem of their
successful breeding. The solution of a problem such as this would,
I think, be of more real value to aviculture than the purchase of a
pair of birds imported for the first time ; their release in an aviary ;
their capricious breeding and the winning of a medal.

THE NESTING OF LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>

Sir, --Having noticed the remarks of Lord Tavistock and others
re the need for dampness in the nesting of Lovebirds, I thought perhaps
the following would be of interest; however, you will know if it is of
general interest or not.
My pair of Masked Lovebirds went to nest in a large coconut-husk
hung up in the inside aviary shelter, which is, of course, perfectly dry.
They stripped bark from the branches in the outside flight, passing
these strips backwards and forward, through their beaks until perfectly
soft, then they put them into their drinking water. When the strips
were thoroughly soaked they carried them to the husk and made the
nest with them. They also went through the same process in adding
to the nest after the young were hatched. Three chicks were hatched,
one died at three weeks old and the other two are now flying. All the
strips were carried in the beak, not in the feathers of the rump.
H. A. Collin&amp;apos;.
[A coconut-husk is not a very suitable receptacle for a Lovebird's
nest, being too small. A wooden box is preferable.-- Ed.]

In our Magazine for February, 1928, there appeared a coloured
plate of a blue variety of the Masked Lovebird that had been imported
by Mr. Chapman, and acquired by the Zoological Society. This bird,
which appears to be the only blue specimen known, proved to be a
male, though it is considerably smaller than the normally coloured
female with which it has been mated. The blue bird had imperfectly
featured wings at first, and it was late in the season before it could
fly sufficiently well to be put out into an aviary. Eggs were laid in
a box in a cage, but, though fertile, they did not hatch. Since the pair
have been out, however, they have reared a brood of fine healthy
youngsters, and now have a second brood in the nest.

Avicultural Notes
As was to be expected, the young are normally coloured, but it will
be very interesting to see what happens in the next generation. There
seems no reason to suppose that in breeding from these young birds
Mendel's laws of heredity will not apply, and from these young birds
we shall expect to obtain 25 per cent of blue offspring, or if we mate
the blue cock to one of his daughters we should obtain round about
50 per cent of blue birds.
In Budgerigar breeding at the Zoo during the past year, we have
obtained a slightly larger proportion of blue birds than was to be
expected. In breeding from blue-bred birds, bred in 1927 from blue
cocks and green hens, we obtained the following results. From twelve
pairs we reared 103 birds, of which 74 were green and 29 blue. In
another aviary 7 blue cocks were mated with 7 blue-bred hens (bred
in 1927 from green cocks and blue hens). Result: 65 young reared,
of which 27 were green, 36 blue, and 2 white.
The Ceylon Jungle-fowl which was always said to be not only
difficult to obtain, but to keep alive when obtained, has proved to be
a very free breeder. Through the kindness of Mr. Walter Shakspeare
a pair was secured early in the year, and these have hatched and reared
two broods of chicks, the second brood, although hatched as late as
October, being reared without difficulty.
The Paradise Sheldrake (Casarca variegata), once so common in
New Zealand, is now said to be extremely rare. It is a very hardy
species and breeds freely in captivity, and if there are sufficient in
captivity to keep the species going there should be no difficulty in
doing so. Four young were reared at the Zoo, and eight in the Scilly
Isles last year. It is the best of the Sheldrake from the avicultural
point of view.

To start with my largest birds, I should say that we have had
very little success with them in 1928. Out of three pairs of adult
White Bheas, only five young were hatched and reared, while out of
six young Darwin's Bheas, bought from Hagenbeck, only two survived.
The others apparently could not stand our cold and damp summer
nights. Many clear eggs among the Pheasants ; such was the case with
Noble and Vieillot's Firebacks, Polyplectrons and Soemmerrings.
However, a good many Siamese Firebacks, Eared Pheasants (Hoki's),
Bel's, Beeves', Versicolour, Corean Bingnecks, Dark-coloured (mutant)
were reared. Edward's Pheasants were hatched, but not reared, and
two hybrids (three-quarters Edward's and one-quarter Swinhoe's) died
when three months old. Two Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, two Imperial
Pheasant, and one Argus were fully reared. Many hybrids born from
a pure cock Javan Jungle Fowl and half JavaXBankiva hens were
hatched, but none reared to maturity. Some Bankivas were reared
in the park and woods, as well as Wild Turkeys, but young Monauls
were destroyed by Crows. Some good additions to my Pheasants
collections during the past year are two cocks and one hen Mikados,
one pair of the new Lewis' Pheasants, from Cambodia, Bornean Argus
and Bheinardt's.

J. Delacoiu--Bird Notes from Cleres
For the first time my numerous Cranes have been separated in
pairs in different fields. I hope some will nest next year. I have tried
Cariamas at liberty ; one male of the Crested species proved dangerous
to other birds, while a female and one Burmeister's.are quite harmless.
They are amusing and absurdly tame.
I have added some American Red Flamingoes to my flock of
Europeans. Since they have been shut in at night I have had no losses,
and when the birds are fully acclimatized they will prove quite hardy ;
the main thing is to avoid, with newly imported birds, the cold summer
nights.
One young Black-necked Swan has been reared, out of two eggs
laid for the first time by an imported pair. Some Ashy-headed, Ross's,
and Blue Snow Geese were bred. I was able to add several interesting
and rare species to my collection of Waterfowl during the last summer :
Red-breasted, Abyssinian Blue-winged, Siberian Bean Geese, South
African and Paradise and Rajah Shell drakes, Steamer Ducks, and
Madagascan Teal (A. hernieri). Some three hundred young have been
bred the last season, including Ringed, Chilian, Blue-winged Teal.
I have now a dozen Eider Ducks in perfect health, and as some
are now three years old I have hopes of their breeding next spring.
Scoters, sent from the seashore, have been on the lake for several
weeks and seem to do very well.
My friend Mr. Spedan Lewis sent me a fine pair of Snowy Owls,
which I have housed in a quaint aviary arranged in a ruined tower,
where they are doing beautifully.
In conclusion, let me give news of my greenhouse aviary, of which
I told you last December. All the birds have been doing beau-
tifully in it so far, with the exception of the Tanagers, many of which
died as a result of their feeding too much on the Sunbirds' food ;
that cannot be avoided. Blue-winged, yellow, violet, and all greens are
exceptions and still flourish. Sunbirds, Sugar-birds, and Pittas are
perfect, and also one pair of King Birds of Paradise, and a pair of
Amethyst Starlings which I added to the little collection two
months ago.

I publish the following nesting notes from my aviaries hoping that
members may find them interesting. Although the year 1928 began
well, and everything looked most promising, and a number of nests
were built and eggs laid, very few birds were reared.
Silver-eared Mesia (Mesia argentauris). --Built a cup-shaped
nest of dried grass in a box bush. Three eggs laid. Two young hatched.
Drowned during rainstorm when a week old.
Edward's Lory ( Trichoglossus hoematodes). --Laid two white eggs
in an upright nesting box with concave bottom. Both eggs broken
during incubation ; a second clutch of two eggs were incubated for
ten days. Young died in shell.
Chestnut-breasted Rock Thrush ( Petrocincla erythrogastra ).-- \0x25A0
Nest built of hay, moss, wool, and leaves. Cup-shaped in an open box.
Two clutches of two eggs each, creamy-white ground with fawn-coloured
spots. Both lots deserted after a few days. Eggs fertile. [A coloured
plate of this species appeared in the Magazine for July, 1913.--Ed.]
Diamond Doves ( Geopelia cuneata). --Three young successfully
reared.

young fully reared. One egg only in each clutch. These birds have not
stopped breeding since October, 1927, when they reared the first young.
They kept it up all the winter and all last summer. One young just

THE BREEDING OF THE YELLOW-WINGED
SUGAR-BIRD IN JAPAN
By Yashmori Matsunaga
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997700806451613" page_id="56215700"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
During the breeding season of 1928 I was fortunate enough to rear
two chicks of the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird (Ccereba cyanea) in my
aviary, and if this record is a help to others I shall be very pleased.
I obtained my pair of these birds in 1926 and they were fed chiefly
on banana and orange when they came to my aviary, but it is difficult
to get such fruits abundantly here, so I tried to change their food,
and was successful in substituting the Japanese soft food with honey.
At first I gave this food in almost a liquid state, and in a few days the
birds began to take it, and after a week they could do well without
fruits.
I placed them in an aviary of 8 X 3 X 6 feet, of which a space
5 feet is uncovered. There are lots of plants in the open portion of
the aviary.
I took the birds from this aviary to a cage in December and kept the
cage in a room until April, when I put them again into the aviary.
As they were doing very well in the aviary, I did not take them out
during the winter, and they thrived and were in very good health
all the season. I neither cover the aviary, nor shut the glass windows
which are attached to the covered part.
My place is rather warmer than other parts of Japan and we have only
three or four days during the winter that the temperature goes down
under -- 5* and generally it stays about --- 2* Centigrade.
In May they showed signs of breeding and began to build their
nest in a shrub in the aviary.
This nest was completed on 3rd June and consisted of fibres of the
Japanese palm (Chamaerops excelsa )&amp;apos;and cocoa-nut. I saw the first
egg on the 8th of June, and in the early morning of the 10th I saw
the second one. The incubation was carried out entirely by the female
who was utterly ignored by her mate, so she had to leave the nest
several times every day in order to take her food. On the 1st of July
I found the eggs were clear. The egg is pale brown with dark spots on

it and it is quite large compared with the size of the bird. It measures
18 X 14-15 mm.
On 4th of July the first egg of the second clutch was laid and the
next day another and the hen bird sat on them immediately. In the
morning of the 19th two dark brown chicks were hatched out. The
colour of the chick is blackish brown and, unlike its parents, its bill
is as short as that of a nestling Finch.
I fed them chiefly on spiders, and occasionally green caterpillars,
such as are found on the leaves of roses and cabbages. The parents
gave this food to the chicks, covering it with honey which they have
sucked into their crops. At this time they took no notice of fruit,
though I gave it to them.
The third day after hatching, the length of the quills were about
6 mm. and black feathers were showing on the back, and after a week
the pinion feathers grew 15 mm. and the whole body was covered with
feathers and the eyes opened. At about this time the bill grew about

10 mm.

<bodyText confidence="0.95031065" page_id="56215701"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
One chick left the nest on the 31st of July and the other on the 1st
of August, so it took 13 and 14 days for the chicks to leave the nest,
but I think in the wild state where they can get plenty of insects they
may leave the nest in about 12 days.
The colouration of the chicks at this time was similar to that of the
female, but the sides were pale grey and the bill much shorter than that
of the adult, and the legs were greyish black instead of orange red.
The chicks had very little power of flight when they left the nest,
but soon they were able to fly well after their parents asking for food.
In about two weeks the bills grew as long as those of the adults
and the greyish white flanks turned to green.
I gave water-melon to them on the 13th of August, but they looked
at it with suspicion at first, and did not go near, but the next day the
parents ate vigorously and on the 16th I saw the chicks peck it by
themselves.
This paper is written on 2nd of September, but still the chicks fly
after the parents for food so I wonder when they will become quite
independent.
I will write later on this subject and that of moulting.

ON SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL NESTING
ATTEMPTS OF THE CUBAN OR RED-

By A. A. Prestwich
It has often been asserted that aviculturists take a secret delight
in hearing of the misfortunes and failures of their fellows. This seems
inconceivable, but such an assertion is possibly true of a small section
of the community composed of " bird-keepers "--they are unworthy
to be called aviculturists.
If on the other hand such a state of affairs really exists, then, indeed,
this recital of the long series of nesting failures of my Red-speckled
Conures should give eminent satisfaction to not a few readers.
We so often read of the successful breeding of a species that, in
any case, an account of a failure should be quite refreshing, and at the
same time act as an incentive to members to relate some of their less
fortunate experiences.
Towards the-end. of April, 1924, I received from Mr. Gr. B. Chapman
a pair of so-called Cuban Conures (C. euops) ; at that time they were
considered something of a. rarity. This species had, of course, been

Nesting Attempts of the Cuban or Bed-specklecl Conure 83
imported previously, but at the time of which I write they were rather
uncommon on the market.
They were in pretty fair condition on arrival, except that each had
the flight feathers of one wing cut--a misfortune only too common
where South American Parrakeets are concerned. I intended keeping
them caged until such time as they might be able to fly, but their
shrieks were intolerable and I had grave thoughts of returning them on
this account. Now, however, I am extremely glad that I did not do
so, as I have seldom had a pair of more amusing and engaging birds.
The weather seemed fairly settled so I risked turning them out into an
aviary, 55 feet long and 22 feet wide, which was already occupied by
numerous Budgerigars, Cockatiels, Rosellas, Lineolated Parrakeets,
etc., all living in more or less harmony.
The Conures quickly adjusted themselves to their new surroundings,
and behaved tolerably well until their new feathers had grown and they
were able to fly. They then asserted themselves as rightful rulers of the
aviary, and became something of a nuisance, not only on account
of their bullying the other inmates, but because of their almost
incessant cries and the damage they wrought to the woodwork of the
aviary.
They are extremely active birds, always on the move and when
flying one is afforded an opportunity of seeing the lovely brilliant
red under wing-coverts--the chief beauty of this species.
It was not expected that they would attempt to nest during the
first couple of seasons, as Parrakeets of this description require at
least two years to attain the necessary condition. No attempt was
made during 1924 or the following year, and I do not think that they
even inspected nest-boxes, except out of curiosity as to the doings
of the other birds. They are quite the most inquisitive birds I have
ever possessed : the slightest thing out of the ordinary or anything
fresh has to be investigated and examined minutely. At one time
a pair of Yellow-backed Lories in a neighbouring aviary was a never-
ending source of wonder and amusement to them. Possibly they
were jealous of the almost complete suits of red worn by the Lories,
whereas they themselves only had spots and patches of the same colour !
They , chewed up a number of coco-nut husks, but this was only part

of their programme of wanton destruction. In April, 1926, I had them
caught and sent down from London and turned out into a much smaller
aviary 18 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, to which was attached
a shelter house 6 feet wide, 4 feet deep and 7J feet high at the back,
sloping down to 6 feet at the front. This aviary was at first shared with
a pair of All-green Parrakeets. The latter, however, had to be removed
to other quarters, as the Euops attacked them in a most frenzied manner,
and I feared for their safety. About a week after their arrival in the
New Forest district they commenced chewing up nest-boxes and at the
beginning of May found one that apparently suited their requirements.
This was a horizontal box some 18 inches long, 9 inches wide and 9 inches
high, with the entrance hole high up in a corner of the front. A
depression had been made in the botton at the end further from the
entrance hole, and a false sloping floor had been fitted in an attempt
to ensure that the female would lay nowhere but in the desired place,
or alternatively that the eggs, if laid elsewhere, would roll along to
the depression--rather an optimistic expectation.
Eventually five eggs were laid and all seemed to be going well.
When at the end of three weeks I ventured to open the inspection door
to my great disgust I found only the remains of several eggs. Whether
the eggs were infertile and they tired of sitting or whether they had
eaten them to spite me for looking in their box before the actual
commencement of incubation I cannot say, although, when I made
my inspection, both birds were out in the flight. Possibly their insatiable
inquisitiveness had led them to sample their products. They hardly
left their box during the next few weeks, probably through shame of
their fell deed, but they finally emerged from retirement, and once more
made the countryside hideous with their cries.
Both birds incubate, and during such period are almost silent and
rarely seen. The only sound heard is a pretty and gentle little " croon "
coming from the nest-box, but whether this is made by both birds
or only the male it is impossible to determine. During August a second
attempt was made, and this time I believe the clutch consisted of four
eggs. Sad to relate the male (presumably) succeeded in gnawing a
hole through the bottom of the box, with the result that the eggs
fell through. The old box was replaced by a similar, but stouter.

Nesting Attempts of the Cuban or Bed speckled Conure 35
Towards the end of March, 1927, another endeavour was made.
The female successfully laid one egg when a cold snap intervened,
the result being that she was found in the shelter badly egg-bound.
After being subjected to considerable heat she delivered herself of
the offending burden. This egg, which measured 29 X 23 mm., only
slightly larger than the average, was found to be double-yolked.
Thus another attempt came to naught. The delight of the male was
unbounded when his partner was returned to the aviary, and it was
charming to see the way he crooned over her and preened her feathers.
A sailor's return was completely eclipsed by this reunion.
Nothing daunted, a fourth essay was made at the beginning of
September. Four eggs were laid, and were eventually broken. Absolute
quietness reigns in the neighbourhood of the Conures' aviary,nevertheless
they are very restless and instead of calming down for the incubation
period they are, if anything, more unsettled. They rarely actually
leave their nest-box, but they can be heard scuttling round and round
inside, nibbling at the wood and apparently playing. This inconsistent
behaviour would appear to be the cause of broken eggs in the first place,
and now it would seem that they are confirmed egg-eaters.
Once more about Easter last year the Conures became silent and
I knew that they were yet again about to attempt to reproduce them-
selves. I did not attach much importance to this effort, supposing that
it would end in disaster as its four predecessors, but still eternal hope
prevented me from disturbing them and I refrained from breaking into
their privacy. My supposition proved correct and this batch of eggs
was likewise destroyed. They nested yet a sixth time in August and
to my unbounded surprise did not eat the four eggs laid, but sat most
diligently. Unfortunately, however, they proved infertile. Possibly
all the previous clutches hav# been similarly lacking fertility, and the
producers have tired of sitting. The female has now laid upwards of
thirty eggs--a record that compares favourably with those of some
backyard fowls !
I am hoping for greater success this year and great will be my
rejoicing should the next attempt give the desired result. During the
four and a half years I have had these Conures they have eaten little
in the seed line but white sunflower, and of this they husk about an

ounce each per day. I estimate that since they came to me they have
shelled approximately two hundredweight. A little canary seed is
eaten occasionally, but not millet. As regards fruit, they are very
partial to apples and it is immaterial whether they are sweet or not,
provided they are soft. They, in common with the majority of Conures,
waste very much more than they consume. Sometimes they will partake
half-heartedly of a sweet orange. They are exceedingly fond of
bathing and rarely miss a day, no matter how cold the weather.
After a considerable amount of observation I am able to note
several differences as regards the sexes. The female is slightly smaller
and somewhat slimmer than the male. The male has a larger and
flatter head, also his upper mandible is larger, broader, and appears
more hooked than that of his mate. Many more red areas are observable
on the -male, but I do not think this point could be relied on as an
indication of sex, as the areas become more numerous yearly and would
seem to denote age. When the under wing-coverts are compared
it is noticed that the male is coloured a rather more brilliant red, also
the scarlet band is more extended than in the female.
My birds have attained an extraordinary size and greatly exceed
any other examples of this species I have yet seen. Their large size
cannot be attributed to fat, gained on account of their sunflower seed
diet, as they are in perfect condition.
I have more than a faint suspicion that my birds may be examples
of Conurus chloropterus, from which species C. euops differs but little
except in size. The habitat of the former is San Domingo, whereas
that of the latter is Cuba ; but these two islands are only about fifty
miles distant from each other, so it may well be that the one species is
merely a lesser race of the other.
For the benefit of those members who are unacquainted with this
species I append the description given by Salvadori in the Cat. Birds
Brit. Mus., vol. xx, p. 186.

PIGEONS

Pigeons, like Parrots, are a very homogenous family, with such
distinct characteristics that the most superficial observer could not
confound a Pigeon with a bird belonging to any other family.
The two dominant characteristics are the shape of the feet and beak.
The tarsi are short, thick, sometimes covered with down ; the toes--
three in front and one behind--are furnished with short curved claws.
The beak is straight and slender, rather weak, horny only at the tip,
its base is covered with a soft membrane which comes to below the
long nostrils, which are rounded at the ends ; in certain species the
nostrils are wide and open.
They have round heads, prominent foreheads, and thick-set bodies ;
their wings are long and pointed, and usually have ten flight feathers.
Their tails may be either short and rounded, or, as in certain species,
long and conical. The twelve rectrices are strong and hard. The plumage
is thick and evenly distributed, grey is usually the dominant colour,
but the wings and neck are frequently ornamented with metallic hues.
Pigeons are spread over the whole surface of the earth save the Polar
regions. They are monogamous and live paired ; some kinds go in
flocks. The nests are made of twigs and straws in trees, sometimes in
holes in cliffs, rarely on the ground. The clutch usually consists of
two eggs, in some cases of one only.
The young are fed for the first days of their lives on a milky liquid
secreted from the crops of the old birds when nesting ; therefore it is
unnecessary to change their usual food when they are feeding young.

Pigeons feed on seeds and hard fruits, such as acorns and beech
nuts. Some kinds (Carpophagince) are fruit eaters. They drink without
throwing back their heads, sucking up the water instead of letting
it run down their throats as most other birds do.
Pigeon, Dove, and Turtle Dove are names which do not correspond
to any scientific classification ; but as a rule the large species are
popularly termed Pigeons, and the smaller Doves and Turtle Doves.
Pigeons and Doves are good aviary birds on account of their
hardiness, beauty and elegant forms as well as by the ease with which
they accommodate themselves to our climate and breed in confinement.
Most of them are hardy enough to live all the year round in the open
provided they are given a comfortable, dry, and light shelter where
they can take refuge when it rains and on frosty nights. Many species
find the branches of a conifer or other evergreen sufficient protection,
but others require a certain amount of heat, such as for instance the
Pigmy Doves of America and the Masked Doves, etc., which should be
kept out of reach of frost from November to the end of March.
Some Doves can stand low temperatures yet must not be left out
during winter because their feet are apt to get frost-bitten ; this does
not actually kill them, but they become crippled and useless for
breeding from ; Bleeding-heart Doves, the Geotrygon, Smith's Doves,
and the Blue-headed Doves from Cuba, etc., are particularly subject
to frostbite. For this reason they should be taken in for the winter,
or, which is far better, installed in frost-proof aviaries which are very
slightly heated.
Doves are most delicate just after they reach Europe. They are
timid, rather stupid birds, startled by the least thing, when they dash
themselves, head foremost, against the bars of their travelling cages.
Some species have very thin skulls and kill themselves outright in
their panic 1 ; others severely injure their heads and are " scalped "
for the rest of their lives. To avert such accidents the tops of the
travelling cages should be padded and the birds should get light without
being able to see out. Supposing them to arrive in good condition,
and if the year is not too advanced the best thing is to turn them into

a sheltered aviary well provided with boughs and fine sand, of which
they should be the only occupants : let them out in fine weather for a
few hours, but shut them in in wet or windy weather and at night,
for many species dislike wind. In this way the birds will get used to
confinement and grow tame ; it will then be time to settle them into
their permanent aviary among other birds.
If, unfortunately, the birds arrive ill or very tired, they must be
caged or placed in an inside aviary which should be well provided
with green boughs. If they are caged we would advise box cages with
stretched canvas tops, or wicker cages ; the cages should be placed
high up near the ceiling and covered with a cloth if required. Every
precaution must also be taken to prevent panics when the daily cleaning
takes place.
Although I have seen and even owned Doves tame enough to feed
from their owner's hand, I consider them generally speaking timid
and nervous. For this reason they are not adapted to cage life, and
should be aviary birds.
Provided they are well fed and cared for, a month to six weeks is
usually long enough to enable the birds to recover from the effects
of their journey. We will mention their special ailments presently.
Food
With exception of the Carpophaginoe, which live on fruit, all Pigeons
live on seeds and greenstuff. The small Turtle Doves eat red and
white millet and canary seed. The larger Doves and Pigeons chiefly
live on hemp, corn, buckwheat, rice, etc. We usually feed them on a
mixture of equal parts of corn, buckwheat, kibbled maize, and jarrah
peas and vary it now and then by adding rice, ordinary kibbled peas,
and hemp. This last is usually given in cold weather or in spring
when the birds are pairing. The Doves also have bread and milk or
boiled rice, prepared by being turned into cold water after cooking,
as this keeps the grains whole and firm. All Pigeons enjoy this rice.
Tufts of grass in the aviary provide sufficient green food for the
birds ; but in summer we add chicory leaves. A titbit which they much
appreciate is a mixture of bread crumbs and shelled peanuts passed
through a mincing machine and reduced to about the size of peas.

<bodyText confidence="0.999485277777778" page_id="56215714"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
A supply of salt should not be forgotten ; it may either be mixed
with the sand or one of the blocks sold under the name of " rock salt "
for Pigeons may be placed in a corner of the food vessel. They are
fond of it and it helps to keep them in good health.
Finally, it must not be forgotten that most Doves in their wild
state eat worms and caterpillars ; a handful of mealworms or even
well-cleaned maggots and their pupae will always please the birds and
be useful when they are rearing young. In fact, I think it would be
difficult to succeed in rearing young Bleeding-heart Doves, for instance,
without providing maggots and mealworms ; some species of Geotrygon
too eat a quantity of insects while they are breeding.
Other species readily eat berries and many take to the soft food
provided for their companions in captivity.
We shall speak later of the feeding of frugivorous Pigeons when we
come to the chapter which deals with them especially. Here we will
only remark that they eat chopped up fruit (pears, apples, and bananas),
boiled potatoes and carrots cut into dice, insectivorous food, rice,
and boiled maize, 1 and bread and milk.

Poets have greatly extolled the gentleness of Doves ; aviculturists
know that on the contrary many have quarrelsome ways, which must
be taken into account when it is desired to place them with other
species of Doves or even with other birds. French breeders, who about
the year 1880 began to breed foreign Doves, which just then were for
the first time freely imported, were in the habit of confining each pair
in a separate compartment to themselves. Hardly did they dare to add
a few Waders, Partridges or Pheasants, birds which, as they seldom
left the ground, did not often come in contact with their quarrelsome
neighbours. Further experience has shown us that these precautions
were unnecessary. Some kinds of Doves-- Lophotes , 2 Lophophaps, and
Humeralis, for instance--are very combative and must either be
kept by themselves in pairs, or only with large seed-eating birds. They

do very well with Pheasants. I keep mine in my Parrot aviaries, where
they breed freely, but of course they can only be put with gentle-
natured Parrots.
Luckily bad-tempered Doves are not very numerous, and several
different species can be kept together safely ; but it is well to be prudent
and choose species which are not closely related, for example, not to
put two pairs of terrestrial Doves such as Bleeding-hearts and
Geotrygon together or Peaceful Doves with Diamond Doves. It is
safe to keep Necklaced, Peaceful, and Bleeding-hearts together.
It must, however, be admitted that the same species may include
birds of very different character ; one pair may be peaceable, the next
quarrelsome, and they should be watched for the first few weeks after
they have been put with other birds.
We have already said that Pheasants and Pigeons can be kept
together ; they will also live with other birds.
Small species such as Diamond Doves, Pigmy Doves, and Masked
Doves get on well with Waxbills and Finches, the same diet suiting
both, and they never molest their little companions. Geotrygon and
Phaps may be associated with Cardinals and Whydahs or the quieter
kinds of insectivorous birds. Fierce species like Troupials, Pies, and
Jays would be too dangerous.
I have in one of my aviaries more than twenty pairs of different
Doves which breed freely and never quarrel seriously. But it is a large
thickly planted enclosure and the birds have plenty of cover in which
to retire or escape from enemy pursuit.
Aviaries for Doves are not essentially different from those for small
birds, but they must be larger. A range of flights 25 to 30 feet long, 7 feet
wide, and 6 to 8 feet high is very suitable for a collection of rare Doves.
Three or four pairs could live in each compartment. The open flights
should be planted with living trees and the shelters provided with
pine boughs, and perches about an inch thick or even a little thicker
should be firmly fixed to the sides of the aviary. Boards for shelves
should also be nailed against the walls. Doves like to walk along them
and squat on them to rest. The floor of the shelter must be covered
with a mixture of fine sand and wood ashes, for Doves which never
bathe often dust themselves like fowls. The opening from the shelter

into the flight is best placed near the ground. I have noticed that a great
many Doves prefer these to others which were higher up. The flights
may face south, east, or west if sheltered from wind, which Pigeons
cannot endure.
I cannot recommend too strongly that aviaries for Doves should be
made out of flexible wire netting (simply twisted) in small mesh
(J inch). Only this netting will keep out mice--and mice can harm
even large birds ; besides which Doves, always very timid, are subject
to sudden panics, particularly in the night, when they dash themselves
head first against the wire ; if this is flexible there is far less risk of
their being killed or wounded.
Breeding
A great many Doves will wish to breed as soon as the weather is
fine, therefore all the aviaries should be thoroughly cleaned out not
later than the middle of March, fresh boughs fixed, and the floor of
the shelters freshly sanded after washing with very hot water mixed
with a disinfectant. Then the nesting boxes should be put up.
If the aviary is planted with shrubs, many Doves will build in
them without further trouble, but others prefer baskets or boxes.
I use three kinds : large baskets made of willow or rushes such as are
sold for domestic Pigeons to nest in ; baskets like those used by
Canaries, only larger ; and flat boxes according to the size of the bird
which hang from a nail fixed in the walls. The receptacles must be
lined with hay ; the Doves will add other material to it.
It often happens that certain kinds, incapable of themselves building
a nest, refuse to lay in a basket because they do not like its position.
It should then be fixed to the bough on which the bird is vainly trying
to build, she will invariably take to it. The best nesting materials
to provide are small twigs, little bits of heather, short straws, long
pine needles, and some coarse hay. The hen builds the nest out of
the materials which the cock brings.
To prevent egg-binding give them old mortar (old plaster), roughly
crushed egg shell, and above all granulated oyster shell, which is sold
for poultry. Incubation varies according to the species. No extra food
is required while the young are being reared, as they are fed by a

secretion from the crops of their parents. But it is as well to increase
the bread and milk and mealworms given to the breeding birds.
Young Doves often leave the nest before they can fly well. Then
they squat on the ground and must not be allowed to remain on damp
soil. The best way is to keep them in the shelter on some dry litter.
After two or three days they are usually able to perch and fly about.
It happens occasionally that the parent birds are too ready to go to
nest again and abandon their young prematurely, in which case they
are often lost. To prevent this the new nest and eggs may be taken
away, or the cock and hen separated, leaving one parent with the
nestlings. Or an attempt may be made to rear the young birds by
hand. To do this " take the bird's beak between your lips, when
it will instinctively expect food, and push into the open beak softened
seed mixed with bread crumbs ''A I have known people who were very
clever at it.
Some Doves will refuse to rear their young in an aviary which
they dislike. Others, wanting to go to nest again, desert their eggs
after incubating them for a few days. These eggs should be put under
other Doves, good sitters, who will rear them. The Barbary Dove
is a kind mother and looks well after her nurselings. The white variety
is preferred by some amateurs for this purpose. I have successfully
tried Loopholes as foster-mothers for Phaps and Diamond Doves have
reared Pigmy and Masked Doves for me. Another experienced breeder
advises the employment as foster-parents of hybrids between the
Barbary Dove and Common Pigeon. These are larger and feed the
young longer, which is a decided advantage, for it often happens that
given species which mature slowly the Barbary Doves abandon them
before they can feed themselves. Then they must be artficially fed,
a tiresome business.
The Marquis de Brisay gives the following advice on the installation
of foster Doves 2 : " The foster Doves should be kept in pigeon holes
arranged like a bookcase with two tiers, each compartment being about
a metre square. It is a sort of cupboard two metres high by two wide,
one metre deep and divided by cross partitions into four separate

compartments. All the sides of these boxes are of wood ; the front is
wired and the interior communicates with the outside by a sliding
door on one side of each compartment." This house is kept from
wind, rain, and cold in a warm light room which can be thoroughly
aired. One pair of foster-parents is placed in each division with a basket
filled with hay. As soon as they have laid, those eggs which they are
intended to hatch are substituted for their own. They may even be
given half-grown nestlings which their own parents have forsaken.
The foster-parents must be used to a mixture of seeds, millet, maize,
and hemp, and to bread and milk, chopped hard-boiled eggs, insects,
mealworms, and maggots. "It is by these methods that the best
results are obtained," writes the Marquis de Brisay.
Some breeders, particularly our late colleague Monsieur A. Delaurier,
have very successfully reared rare Doves, especially the Bleeding Hearts,
by the use of well-selected and well-fed foster-mothers.
The attempt has been made on several occasions to keep various
foreign birds at liberty in gardens. Doves would appear to be
particularly well suited for this purpose ; they are strong, many can
stand the vagaries of our climate quite safely, and most of them do
not wander far from where they w^ere turned out.
The best time to let them out is spring, in a garden planted with
evergreen trees. Conifers provide excellent shelter from rain, snow,
and tempest. The Doves wdiich are to be set free should be confined
in a small flight in the middle of the garden where they will be turned
loose. The cocks should be let out first, and when they have got used
to their surroundings, the hens. They must of course be fed every
day, or they will either die of hunger or fly away.
Their enemies are cats and Owls, against whom relentless war must
be waged.
I have the following Doves at liberty : Barbary, Senegal, Gold-
necked (Z. auriculata), and Lophotes. These last are extremely
decgrative, but the cocks are very quarrelsome in the breeding season,
which is practically all the year round, and all the pairs emigrated one
after another, except the worst fighters, which settled down well and
reared their young when they had rid themselves of their rivals. The
Necklaced Doves flew far and wide and often were not seen for weeks ;

they were finally lost in the woods. Senegal and Barbary Doves made
no attempt to migrate.
For further details on this interesting form of aviculture I refer my
readers to Lord Tavistock's article " Foreign Doves at Liberty " which
appeared in the February Avicultural Magazine for 1914, and an

to 39).
Diseases 1
The diseases of aviary birds are still little understood, and in many
cases the remedies are unknown. Doves are fortunately healthy
creatures and, provided they are well cared for, little subject to serious
illness. Diarrhoea, which is usually caused by long-continued damp,
,can generally be cured by keeping the affected bird dry and warm
and removing all laxative food. A cold should be dealt with in the same
way ; a few drops of glycerine mixed with the drinking water are
good medicine, and a little syrup of iron phosphate, which is an excellent
tonic. Constipation is not common and can be treated by giving tepid
olive oil. Miss Rosie Alderson also advises drops of oil introduced into
the vent in cases of egg-binding, which, however, do not often occur
among Doves.
Fits are rare ; they are usually caused by a blow, or by a sudden
fright. The sufferer should be kept cool, sprinkled wdth cold water,
and made to drink a little good brandy and water. Afterwards it should
have Vichy water for some days. I think sunstroke is often mistaken
for apoplectic fits. It is advisable to shade aviaries exposed to full
sun by laying leafy branches on the netting during the heat of the day.
Pneumonia, which occurs sometimes after violent change of tempera-
ture, is nearly always incurable. The worst disease which attacks
Pigeons is diphtheria. It is the more to be dreaded because it is most
contagious and can be communicated to every Pigeon throughout the
aviary. It shows itself in different ways, but is always accompanied
by membranes in the throat, which are first white then yellow ; the

bird has more and more difficulty in swallowing as the disease progresses.
The only remedy against Pigeon diphtheria is injection of a special
serum (Vaccin Verge's &amp; Pouissat prepared by the Biological Institute
of Merieux, 17 rue Bourgelet, Lyons). The amount to be injected
depends on the size of the bird. I have never had to use this vaccine
on my foreign Pigeons, but numerous breeders of domestic and fancy
Pigeons have successfully used it.

{Continued from Vol. VI, p. 211)
Our first journey into the wilds of Texas was a very delightful
one. Each season of the year seems to have its own individual
charm in Southern Texas, but I think perhaps it is at its best on a
brilliant sunny day in April, when all nature is pulsating with life, after
a tropical storm, birds everywhere revelling in the joy of life, which a
day such as I have in mind must give to all nature.
With my nephew I motored nearly three thousand miles studying
birds and bird life in Texas ; many times stalking birds through a
dense jungle and tangle of undergrowth into the heart of the forest.
In spite of discomforts and sometimes risks, recollections of keenest
pleasure and excitement are left in one's memory of those days in the
forest, all the picturesque and ever-changing scenes once experienced
can never be forgotten, especially searching for birds on their nests on
the banks of several rivers we visited.
At other places where the soil is poorest the tall wild cactus threw
its green-ribbed shafts into the air ; Woodpeckers, perhaps invisible
to us, were making a hoarse chatter in the under woods. Humming
Birds whirring about the blossoms close to our heads might easily
have been caught with a hand net; one of the most lovely is the
Emerald-green, with long tail feathers.
Most of our trips were in Bexar County, South Texas (pronounced
Bear County), about nine hundred square miles in extent.

Two hundred and thirty species of birds, either residents, summer
residents, migrants, and winter residents are found. The American
Mocking-bird is adopted as the state-bird of Texas by the 40th
Legislature.
I spent one month on the Burro Mountains Ranch, North Mexico
(nearly a thousand miles from South Texas). I found there a great
many other species of birds.
One of our first trips near some large lakes was a very interesting
one. After we had journeyed many miles we saw three flocks of the
Scissors-tailed Flycatcher chasing mosquitos over a corner of one
of the lakes, darting about they looked like flocks of long-tailed Swallows.
Close by were a number of Texan Bitterns, which we watched from our
car catching small frogs ; we saw many American Coots and Kill-deer
Plovers, Cinnamon Teal, King Rails, Yellow-billed Cuckoos, Logger-
head Shrikes, and several kinds of Song Sparrows.
A flock of Red-wing Blackbirds flew over from the distant lake,
taking up an observation post on some low trees and rushes : happy,
chattering little birds these are, especially the cock birds, with their
lovely glossy black plumage and bright red patch on the wings. They
were quite tame.
I found for the first time near these lakes the Grey-tailed Cardinal
(this bird was figured in a coloured plate in the Avicultural Magazine,
December, 1924, as " Red Cardinals, two freak specimens ") ; Mr.
Chapman has had these birds since from Mexico, but did not know their
name ; I was able to watch them, found their nest and eggs were quite
different from those of the Red Cardinal (Virginian Nightingale).
One of the most interesting studies of wild life was a Bat roost
which we found late in the day, a small wooden erection something like
a windmill at home without sails, or the upper part of an old church
steeple standing on wooden piles to keep cats, snakes, and other small
animals from climbing into the strange looking house by the side of
the lake ; we arrived just before sunset and just as we got near these
small Bats began to fly out. They formed one long column about half
a mile long and about twenty deep, it looked very remarkable with a
deep blue southern sky for a background. There must have been many
thousands of Bats, they were half an hour leaving the roost ; one or

two large Hawks were taking toll as they flew out. On another day
I saw them when a strong wind was blowing. The Bats flew out and
round in circles something like Rooks at home on a windy day.
I could not find out whether these small Bats migrate or hibernate
in winter. In this house myriads of Bats rear their young and seek
refuge during the day. This species is weak and harmless and man's
benefactor, their chief diet consiting of mosquitoes and other obnoxious
insects.
It is said the city of San Antonio gives the Bats free lodgings (for the
good they do) and so provided this Bat house from whose slat-shaded
windows thousands of Bats flutter at dusk on mosquito hunts. At dawn
they fly back (to sleep by day in their dark retreat).
We were often out a long way from home after sunset, then strange
sounds at times reached us. The cry of the Coyote (Kiote as they are
called here) and its larger relative the timber wolf, their distant cries
mingle with the notes, and resound with the cries of the night birds,
especially one, the large Western Horned Owl, of which Barry Cornwell
writes :--\0x25A0
So when the night falls and the dogs do howl,
Sing ho ! for the reign of the Horned Owl,
We know not alway who are Kings by day,
But the King of the night is the bold Brown Owl.
On another occasion near some water we saw a beautiful pure
White Woodpecker with red head searching for insects on a large
branch of a dead tree.

The Messrs. Webb returned home from a collecting trip to
Portuguese East Africa on Christmas Eve, and brought some very
good birds, of which the following appear to be new to aviculture :--
The Little Bee-eater, Melittophagus meridionalis, of which there
was a pair, is a very beautiful species of the square-tailed group, and
under 6J inches in length.

The White-browed Tinker (Barbatula bilineata), of which there was
one, is a midget Barbet.
The Trumpeter Hornbill ( Bycanistes buccinator) is a small black and
white species, with a large cylindrical casque extending to the end of
the bill.
The Spot-headed Weaver (Sycobrotus stictifrons), of which there
were some half-dozen species, is a forest-loving species, which
appears to be entirely insectivorous. Above it is dark brown, the under
surface being golden-yellow ; the feathers of the crown and throat
tipped with grey. Both sexes are alike in plumage. It is said to be never
met with in flocks, but in single pairs in the thick forest.
The collection contained a number of other rarities, among which
were some Green-necked Touracous (GaMirex cMorochlamys) and a
number of Jameson's and Peters' Firefinches. The last mentioned is
certainly one of the most lovely of the ornamental Finches, and
altogether a most attractive bird, but it is undoubtedly delicate. It
appears to be a frequenter of somewhat thick scrub, and rarely comes
much into the open, but skulks in the shade somewhat after the manner
of our Hedgesparrow. It does well in a small wooden box-cage, but if
turned into a large open aviary without adequate shelter, will probably
succumb very quickly. Hence I would advise those who purchase
these beautiful rarities to keep them for the remainder of the winter
and well into the spring in small wooden box-cages, with plenty of
Indian millet, and when they are finally put into an aviary be sure
that the weather is warm and settled and that there is ample covert.
Mr. Ezra has sent me the body of a cock Peters' Spotted Firefinch
that died in his aviary after a residence there of three years. It is an
interesting specimen from the fact that it has become very much
darker than it should be normally and the white spots have almost
completely disappeared. It would be interesting to hear whether other
aviculturists have noticed a tendency towards melanism in this species
under captive conditions.

Avicultural Notes
In a recent issue of Cage Birds Dr. Amsler recommends sprouting
wheat as a food for Budgerigars, and there is no doubt that it is also
valuable for many other birds. Sprouted Oats are probably quite as
good, and I am not sure that sprouted canary or millet seed would not
be better than any. Oats in a sprouted condition have been used
by poultry-keepers for many years past, and are looked upon as a
most valuable article of diet at a time when young natural green-food
is scarce.
The usual method of preparation is to place the seed in shallow
wooden boxes, which can be placed one above the other provided
fillets of wood are inserted between to allow of a free circulation of air.
The boxes being placed in a moderately warm shed, are thoroughly
watered with a watering-can, and then kept moist by sprinkling with
water until growth has commenced, and when the green shoots are
about an inch long the seed, which has become rooted into a solid mass,
can be taken out of its box and fed to the birds.
Deferring to Lord Tavistock's letter under the heading of " The
Crystal Palace Show ", on page 20, the General Manager of the Crystal
Palace has written to say that in the forthcoming exhibition on
7th, 8th, and 9th February the conditions both as to heating and
lighting of the hall in which the foreign birds will be staged will be
greatly improved.
When one remembers that this show was held, years ago, in the
open central part of the Palace, which was certainly extremely draughty,
one appreciates the great improvement that has been made in holding
it in the Concert Hall, where special arrangements are made for warming.
The lighting has not always been perfect, but this, it appears, is to be
improved, I am sure we should all be very sorry to see the Palace Show
discontinued, and no one has yet suggested a better place.

REVIEW
LORD TAVISTOCK'S BOOK ON PARROTS 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964981647058824" page_id="56215725"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
We have all been \0x25A0 looking forward to the appearance of
Lord Tavistock's promised book on Parrots, and now that it has
appeared we may say at once that none will be disappointed in it.
Excluding the index, which is quite a good one, it contains 288 crown
quarto pages of very clear type, and deals with all of the Parrots
(including, of course, the Parrakeets) that have been or are likely to
be imported alive.
It is divided into three parts : Part I, containing a chapter on
" Cages and Aviaries " and two chapters on " Aviary Management " ;
Part II deals with " Diseases and their treatment " ; and Part III
contains twenty-one chapters dealing with the various groups, such
as " African and New Zealand Parrots ", " The Smaller South American
Parrots ", " Grass Parrakeets and their Allies", and so on. Considerable
changes have been made by ornithologists in the Latin names of birds
in recent years, owing to the desire for strict priority in nomenclature
and the more complete grouping of the natural genera and families,
and Lord Tavistock has followed the latest approved nomenclature,
so that many of the well-known names have disappeared and it is
difficult to recognize some of the scientific names. We could have
wished that Lord Tavistock had included the well-known names as
synonyms, so that we could have recognized, for instance, Forpus
vividus vividus as our old friend, Psittacuia passerina , the Blue-winged
Parrotlet, or Psittacuia torquata as the well-known Palceornis tor quota,
the Indian Ringneck. The genus Conurus has now been split into three
general, Aratinga , Eupsittula , and Thectocercus , and for those who are
not familiar with the latest ornithological literature it is difficult to
recognize the species under their new names without any reference being
given to those we have all learnt to know. And it is a pity that the
authorities for the names are not given. To the majority of readers
these are unimportant details, but in a book, otherwise so excellent, their
omission is to be regretted.

Beview
In the chapter on Cages and Aviaries, the author deals very fully
with his subject and gives much valuable advice. He rightly condemns
the usual type of Parrot-cage with a senseless swing which knocks the
bird's head as it sits on the perch and a grating below which prevents
it from resting its feet on a flat surface and collects&amp;apos;dirt.
With regard to Aviaries, Lord Tavistock has invented the movable
aviary for Parrakeets, which has already been described in the
Avicultural Magazine. The size is 24 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet, and it
is rigidly built and wired with J in. mesh wire-netting over the bottom
as well as the top and sides, the shelter being 2 ft. 6 in. deep. Such an
aviary can be moved on rollers by four men without unduly disturbing
the birds, and providing there is plenty of room and the surface of the
ground perfectly fiat, this is probably about as good an aviary as can
be devised for Parrakeets. But with the majority of aviculturists
space is a consideration and a movable aviary is out of the question ;
and in such cases the author advises that the whole of the surface of the
ground should be of brick or concrete. Such an aviary is doubtless
more hygienic than one in which the outer portion is of natural soil,
with growing turf, and there is much to be said for it, but surely the
removal of 6 inches of the top soil each year, and replacing with new
soil and returfing should be proof against disease germs. Most avicul-
turists wish to keep a few other birds with their Parrakeets, and for
ground-breeding species such, for instance, as Quails, growing grass is
essential. However, Lord Tavistock has had more experience in keeping
and breeding Parrakeets in aviaries than any of us, and the aviaries
he recommends are doubtless the best type that can be devised for
these birds, if these alone are to be kept.
The chapter on Diseases and their treatment, which occupies no
less than fourteen pages, is a very valuable one to the Parrot-keeper.
44 It is no exaggeration to say," writes the author, " that great heat is
the best remedy for 99 per cent of the curable diseases from which
properly managed Parrots are liable to suffer. No owner of a large and
valuable collection of foreign birds should be without a hospital where
the temperature can be maintained at an even 85 degrees Fahrenheit,
whatever outside.conditions may be. It will pay for its cost of erection
and maintenance a hundred times over." D. S-S.

Several examples of this lovely little Sunbird were personally
brought over from the Soudan last July for Mr. J. S. Lewis by a friend.
They bore the long journey remarkably well, thanks to the ingenious
and unremitting care bestowed on them, and only two succumbed
shortly after their arrival in England. The others quickly settled
down and have so far come through the winter.
Both sexes are represented ; the hen, a quietly coloured grey
mite, is not remarkable in any way, but the cock in full plumage,
with the two long tail feathers unbroken, is a gorgeous creature,
particularly when a gleam of sun lights up his iridescent colouring.
It seemed almost impossible to catch them until Mr. and
Mrs. Nottage hit upon the clever idea of watching them go to roost.
Once settled down for the night they could be picked off their perch
by hand. They were given honey and milk mixed and a particular
kind of spider of which they were very fond. Another ingenious
idea was giving them their food in brightly coloured vessels as much
as possible like the flowers on the shrubs which they frequent in
the wild state.

These Sunbirds are exceedingly sensitive to cold. They are kept
in a temperature of between 65 and 70*, but should it drop below
65* they look miserable and droop. When they arrived spiders and
tiny flies were plentiful, and a variety of both were offered, but they
did not care about them nor for newly-hatched Stick insects, which
most birds consider a delicacy. The usual very liquid mixture seems
to satisfy their requirements, and they certainly thrive on it.
Like the rest of their kind they are very quarrelsome, and must
be caged singly.

One of Nature's choicest jewels, this tiny creature is clad in a
raiment which has no fixed colour, in some fights it appears a shining
golden green. It appears like this in my aviary where the fight falls
upon it from above but when in a cage it seems to be a different bird
altogether, the green changes to a wonderful burnished bronze. But
it is when the bird is being sprayed or has just commenced its bath
that the colours are truly marvellous, iridescent pink, blue, green, gold,
purple, in fact every known colour seems to gleam on the plumage of
this tiny jewel.
Sunbirds are charming pets, but they have drawbacks : they are
rare and consequently expensive to buy, and they are rather delicate,
especially in regard to their feet, but a certain cure for bad feet is to
take away all artificial perches and substitute in their place growing
trees in pots or tubs.
I find that a speck of " Liebig's Extract of Meat,", about the size
of a sweet-pea seed, diluted in their food is very beneficial, especially
at the moult, and for those species which will not take insects.
When Sunbirds were first imported some years ago this species
was exceedingly rare, but now there seems to be a number of specimens
in this country.
Sunbirds have always been my favourites, both in a state of freedom
and in captivity. I was fortunate several years ago in making for a

time my home upon a mountain inhabited by no less than eight kinds
of Sunbirds, some of which were extremely rare, and the sight
of six or more different species together flitting about a patch
of honey-bearing flowers, their resplendent plumage flashing and
glistening in the sunlight, made a picture winch will never fade from
my memory.
Many species are very shy, especially the dark kinds such as the
" Amethyst ", " Kirk's ", etc., but most of the more brilliant species
are very familiar and allow one to approach within a yard or two
of them.
The magnificent Scarlet-chested is my favourite, as I once hand-
reared one from the time it was a day or two old, and it would have
reached maturity had not a pet Crow killed it.
The subject of the present article is not, unfortunately, endowed
with much intelligence, but this failing is made up for by its sweet song
and lovely plumage. I found this species rare in the wild state, though
no doubt it is common in certain districts. I believe Andersson found
it fairly common in Damaraland in South-East Africa, and I only
once saw it in a large mimosa-tree by a river. It was exceedingly
shy and appeared to be passing from one district to another. In
captivity the beautiful red on the breast fades to a copper colour,
but the colour can be retained if the bird is fed upon small winged
insects such as green fly and gnats; the specimen which I possess will
not touch these unless it catches them in the air. Gnats can easily
be caught in a large butterfly net on mild winter days as they dance
in swarms under the trees.
When at liberty I have noticed that Sunbirds are very fond of
spiders, and I have seen them hovering like Humming-birds under
the eaves of native huts and houses in search of these delicacies; but
some species will not eat them in captivity.
The male which I now possess is so tame that one can pick him up
in the hand, but recently when sent to a local bird show (for the first
and last time) he was so disturbed that I had to take him and place
his cage in a dark corner most of the time.

SUNBIRDS AND TANAGERS IN OUTDOOR
AVIARIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99804253125" page_id="56215740"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
By the Marquess op Tavistock
For the first few years my 24 ft. by 8 ft. by 8 ft. moveable aviaries
were entirely used for Parrakeets. About eighteen months ago,
however, I had occasion to buy some newly imported Calliste and
Eujphonia Tanagers and keep them some months for a friend, and I
was agreeably surprised to find how well this type of aviary appeared
to suit them. Encouraged by my initial success I decided to experiment
further, and invested in three Superb Tanagers, two cocks and a hen.
Some time previously a fellow member had also given me three Purple
Sunbirds, likewise two cocks and a hen. All these birds have been
in the aviaries since the spring or summer, and up to the time of writing
(16th December) have not had a day's illness. The aviary shelters,
of which the birds make constant use, are heated by Pollard's French
petrol heaters (size 50), which keep the temperature from falling much
below 50* Fahrenheit even in the severest weather. It is, of course,
early days yet to be too confident, as the autumn was exceptionally
prolonged and genial, and the worst of the winter is still before us.
However, we have already experienced hard frost, heavy rain and
periods of dull, chilly gloom, and so far the disaster which my more
experienced friends told me would certainly attend an attempt to keep
Calliste Tanagers at so low a temperature has not materialized.
Although the birds keep almost entirely in the shelter during really hard
weather, they pay frequent visits to the flight when the thermometer
is but a very few degrees above freezing-point, and fly and hop about
in the best of spirits. They are fed on pear and Sunbird mixture
and do not get any oranges or bananas, although I am not sure that
the latter fruit would do them any harm. They like Mealworms but
insectile mixture they hardly touch and they catch a good many insects
for themselves and do not despise earthworms. The bird-book theory
that Tanagers prefer over-ripe fruit appears to be quite a delusion.
My birds have no more use for sleepy pears than I have myself, and
will only eat them when starved into doing so.

<bodyText confidence="0.996161027777778" page_id="56215741"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
My own theory is that the chief need of Calliste Tanagers is not a
very high temperature and complete protection from the inclemency
of the weather, but rich feeding combined with unlimited exercise and
a chance of retreating to a shelter where they are safe from actual
frost, wind and wet. Tanagers are by nature extremely active birds,
and if the poor creatures are sluggish in cages it is because they are
depressed by close confinement. When presented with no more
interesting form of exercise than a jump from one perch to an exactly
similar one, they may say, like Queen Victoria, " We are not amused,"
and sit in one position till they die of surfeit. Sunbirds, also, both
Indian and African, appear, when in good condition, to be by no means
unduly sensitive to cold. Indeed, if it were possible to keep their
food from freezing, I believe some species would prove to be among
the hardiest of the smaller softbills. Two days ago one of my cock
Purple Sunbirds escaped from the aviary during dull and very chilly
weather, the thermometer being hardly above freezing-point. He
only got a few sips of food that afternoon, as we were very anxious to
entice him, by hunger, into a cage before night fell. In this we were
unsuccessful and, the sky clearing at dusk, there were some sixteen
degrees of frost during the long December night. Next morning
the truant again appeared and was caught, and after a feed was not
a penny the worse for his exposure. He was in heavy moult at the
time, and is, I should say, rather an aged bird past the prime of life.
It is a great pity that Sunbirds have such horrible tempers. Two
cocks invariably fight to the death, nor will a cock even condescend
to behave decently to his mate throughout the year. I find Purple
Sunbirds all right with their hens when in colour, when moulting into
eclipse, and when in eclipse, provided, of course, that they have plenty
of room : but when they start to moult back into breeding plumage
it is necessary to remove the hens to save their lives. Sunbirds are
also pretty disagreeable to birds of other orders, bullying them when on
the wing, even when they dare not attack them at rest. Were it not
for this unfortunate failing they would be among the most charming
of aviary inmates, interesting, beautiful, long-lived, and intelligent.
My second cock Purple Sunbird is full of character. He always roosts
sensibly in the aviary shelter, but nothing will induce him to enter it

before lie is ready for bed. His owner or aviary attendant may have
some urgent reason for wanting to shut the birds up a little earlier
than usual, but this makes no difference to him and neither persuasion
nor force will induce him to enter the shelter a moment before he
considers the correct time has arrived. Although normally not tame
and interested in humanity he is well aware that we are responsible
for the commissariat department. Occasionally, through some
accident, the food supply has run out, a serious matter for a Sunbird,
which is speedily reduced to exhaustion if deprived of liquid nourish-
ment ; on such occasions the little bird has always called my attention
to the trouble by departing from his usual behaviour and flying right
up to me as soon as I appear within sight, looking anxiously into my&amp;apos;
face in a way which expresses his trouble as plainly as words could do. 1

DEATH OF A FAMOUS RING-NECKED

By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
I feel sure members who have seen my very clever performing
Parrakeet will be sorry to hear of his death. While sitting on the
finger of my housemaid, who has always looked after him, he had a
stroke and died in a couple of minutes, evidently from advanced age.
I bought him in Calcutta nineteen years ago as an adult bird, so he
must have been at least twenty-five years old, if not more. For the last
five years, although he moulted out in perfect condition each year,
I noticed that his flight feathers were getting yellow, otherwise he looked
as sleek as ever.
In all my experience I have never come across such a clever or such
a tame bird. He would go on to anybody's finger without ever trying
to bite, but the moment he saw me, he would fly back to me. He was
devoted to me, and, needless to say, I shall miss him most frightfully.
I bought him from an Indian who had taught him all his tricks and for

whom lie used to perform in the presence of huge crowds for money.
His best tricks were :--
(1) Twirling a torch, lighted at both ends (Fig. 1).
(2) Drawing water in a small wooden bucket.
(3) Using a bow and arrow (Fig. 2).
(4) Picking out a particular card or coin I asked for from half a dozen
others, and bringing it up to me.
(5) Threading very tiny beads (Fig. 3).
(6) Retrieving like a dog anything I threw to the other end of the
room.
(7) Loading and firing a cannon, which went off with a terrific
report.

<bodyText confidence="0.977918888888889" page_id="56215745"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
and then ringing the prayer-bell (Fig. 4).
I took photos of him while doing some of his tricks, and I am sure
they will be interesting to others. I may say that the most wonderful
and difficult trick of all was threading the beads (Fig. 3). A few glass
beads were placed on the table and a piece of thread with a knot at one
end, and a short blunt needle at the other end was given to him. He
did the threading with his beak and tongue.
What was most extraordinary about the bird was that he never
forgot his tricks. Once after a lapse of a whole year he did them perfectly,
and only ten days ago he performed for some children. Clever as he was
with his tricks, he never talked at all. He was kept and fed like any
other Parrot, and only kindness and coaxing with a grape or a nut
used to make him do his tricks quickly. Once, when in a hurry, I was
rather impatient with him, with the result that he refused to do anything,
and flew away each time I brought him on to the table.
I suppose twenty-five years is a good life for a Ring-necked
Parrakeet. I am glad he died suddenly without suffering, but feel sure
such a perfect bird will never again be seen.

and others. But rarely does anything appear concerning our con-
fraternity across the Atlantic. Probably few are aware even that in
America there is a society with objects similar to our own, and which
is styled " The Avicultural Society of America Only recently
founded, the members number some 130 ; what they lack in numbers,
however, they make up in enthusiasm. Many are supporters of our
Society, and not only is Mr. W. H. Browning--who joined the
Avicultural Society in 1906--the President, but of the four Vice-
Presidents three--Mr. C. T. Metzger, Mr. Kenneth Woodward, and
Dr. Leon Patrick--are members. The Treasurer, Mr. E. W. C. Arnold,
also belongs to both Societies. It is to be hoped that the fourth Vice-
President, Mr. George Washington, 1 and the Secretary and Editor,
Mr. B. F. Lippold, will also, in due course, join our Society. Hence a
few notes on the interests of some of the foremost members may not
be out of place. For much of the following I am indebted to Mr. C. T.
Metzger, who, in addition to being a Vice-President is the Corresponding
Secretary.
Mr. Jesse H. Arnold, of Long Beach, California, has been interested
in aviculture for many years, and has a large and varied collection. He
is one of the select band of enthusiasts attempting to preserve from
extinction some of the fast disappearing species of Australian
Parrakeets.
Mr. T. H. Barry, of Los Angeles, specializes in the breeding of the
rarer exotic Finches, and he is probably the first aviculturist in the
U.S.A. to breed all three imported species of the Parrot Finch. Lately
he has become interested in the various species of foreign Quail.

absence abroad, and Mr. Dwight Winter--one of our members--has been elected

The President, Mr. W. H. Browning, of Rye, New York, has kept
very many varieties of birds during the past twenty years. He is greatly
handicapped in his breeding attempts by the severe winter weather.
His interests are centred on the Parrot tribe, and he has bred many of
the commoner Parrakeets and Leadbeater's Cockatoo. Many Finches,
Cardinals, Pheasants, and species of Waterfowl are also kept. He
possesses one of the best libraries of ornithological works in America.
Mr. George H. Corsan, of Michigan, is the manager of the large
bird sanctuary recently established by Mr. W. K. Kellogg. At present
he is specializing in aquatic and game birds, both foreign and native.
His name is well-known to readers of publications devoted to aviculture
both in America and abroad..
Mr. Claude P. Dorman, of Bakersfield, California, has for many
years confined his efforts to the smaller tropical and sub-tropical
species. Lately he has become interested in some of the Australian
Parrakeets, and African Lovebirds, and is probably the first to breed
Abyssinian Lovebirds in America.
Mr. J. C. Edwards, of Los Angeles, is undoubtedly the largest
breeder of Budgerigars in the U.S.A. In 1928 he bred, and disposed of,
some 15,000 young, including many Blues, Blue-bred, Cobalts, Mauves,
and other colour varieties. His aviaries for breeding are large and
spacious, and he is now arranging for additional ones in the spring.
While the breeding of " Buddies," 1 is a business with Mr. Edwards,
his hobby is breeding Finches and Lovebirds.
Mr. James Ewins, of Pasadena, is a lover of all foreign birds. At
present his interests seem attracted by the various Lovebirds and
Blue " Buddies ".
Mr. William Henry, of Chicago, has been a breeder for more than
forty years. Although without any birds of his own, his interest never
flags, and as he is in charge of the bird-house at the Zoo he has many
opportunities to study species that are unobtainable by the majority
of aviculturists. With the exception of aquatic and game-birds, breeding
is not attempted, owing to lack of space.

cereal manufacturer. However his bird sanctuary of some 700 acres
of woodland, marsh, lakes, and green fields devoted to the propagation
of both native and foreign Waterfowl and Game-birds, is rapidly
becoming one of the features of the Middle West. Here already have
been assembled many pairs of rare and beautiful birds, and the present
stock is constantly being added to as specimens become available.
Many buildings and pens for housing the more delicate species during
the winter months have been provided, and many more will be erected
as the necessity arises.
Mr. C. T. Metzger, of Chicago, has been a breeder and lover of birds
for nearly fifty years. There are but few species that reach the American
market that he has not, at some time or other,&amp;apos;attempted to breed, but
unfortunately not always with success. At present, forced by circum-
stances to live in a large city where space is at a premium, he is compelled
to confine his activities to the keeping of a few of the smaller and
commoner species.
Mr. Karl Plath, of Chicago, is artist, student, aviculturist, and
ornithologist combined. He has undoubtedly the best arranged and
most beautiful outdoor aviary in the Middle West; as well as an indoor
bird-room where he houses the more delicate species during the severe
winter months, when the temperature sometimes drops to 12 degrees
below zero. Mr. Plath, being an artist, is devoting his efforts to securing
and maintaining in perfect health some of the rarer and most beautiful
birds. The majority of his paintings are made from living examples in
his collection. While his breeding experiments have been confined to
but a few species, his success has been remarkable. His paintings and
sketches of birds have been exhibited in all parts of America, and
reproductions have appeared in many publications all over the world.
Dr. Leon Patrick, of Orange, California, is one of those fortunate
aviculturists who reside in " The Land of Perpetual Sunshine ". He
says he has been an aviculturist from the day he pilfered a Quails'
nest when a kid and tried to hatch the eggs under a Duck, or was it a
Goose ? Dr. Patrick was the first American to make a serious attempt
to save some of the vanishing species of Australian Parrakeets. And it is
mainly through his untiring efforts that others have become interested,
and what was considered a doubtful experiment three years ago now

to maturity one of the most difficult species--the Pileated Parrakeet.
He was also fortunate with his Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, breeding
several young. This next season he has great hopes of breeding Elegants
Turquoisines, and Bourkes, provided he is able to secure a couple of,
males for the females he already possesses.
Mr. I. D. Putman, of San Diego, California, is an aviculturist of many
years' experience, and has set aside some fifty acres for his hobby.
His aviaries are large and numerous, and no expense has been spared
to make the pens and houses suitable for the occupants. Every care is
taken to insure the birds those conditions to which they are used in a
feral state, excepting, of course, complete liberty. Later Mr. Putman
will probably try controlled liberty. At present his collection consists
of some 150 species--more than can be seen in any of the American
Zoos at one time. He also is interested in rare Australian Parrakeets,
and has secured a few pairs.
Mr. Francis H. Rudkin, of Fillmore, California, is an Englishman
who has made America his home for the past fifteen years. A keen
observer and close student of every phase of bird-life, it is no wonder
that he is a past master in the " amiable art of aviculture ". No bird
is too large or common to claim his attention and care. His aviaries
are many and large and arranged to suit the species for which they are
intended. If the necessity arises that alterations have to be made
they are immediately carried out regardless of expense. He was born
at Belton, in Rutland, some sixty-five years ago, and has made
aviculture his hobby ever since he was old enough to know what a bird
looked like.

By J. Delacour
The Treronides or Fruit Pigeons make up a very definite group.
The birds belonging to it may be known by their extremely short
partly feathered, tarsi, and by the size of the soles of their feet, which
have every toe widened at the sides by an extension of the skin; also
by their having fourteen tail feathers instead of twelve as is usual with
most Pigeons.

They are confirmed tree-dwellers, jumping and climbing in a peculiar
manner among the branches and feeding on fruit and berries. Nearly
all are brightly coloured, green predominating, but enlivened with
yellow, red, or pink, till their gay colouring reminds one of Parrots.
Fruit Pigeons all have the same habits ; they live in woods or in
the scanty wooded places known as forest clearings, and go from place
to place according as the fruit is ripe. They are particularly fond of
banyan-tree fruit and nutmegs. A good many are either sedentary or
merely wanderers, but some actually migrate. Mostly they live in
flocks, at least for part of the year.
I have often noticed the Asiatic Fruit Pigeons in their wild state;
their flight is rapid and whistling ; they are not timid, returning again
and again to their favourite trees ;! but it is not easy to see them among
the foliage. Their movements are ierky, and more abrupt than those of
other Pigeons, but they often stay motionless for a long time. Their
voices are sometimes harsh, but others produce a real song which is
very musical and may be compared to the sound of a reed flute.
Fruit Pigeons nest in trees at the time when most fruit is ripe ;
they lay one or two eggs in a carelessly built nest like that of the rest
of the Pigeon tribe and generally have several broods in a year. In
spite of their superb colouring, excelling all other Pigeons in beauty,
they are rarely met with in aviaries. A great many aviculturists
neglect them because their requirements are not as simple as those of
others of their order or because of the dirtiness caused by their diet,
or their sluggishness or sudden movements. It is also very difficult
to import them in good condition, for unless they receive great attention
they soil themselves very badly.
Nevertheless, when well fed and housed they are splendid aviary
birds. When they first arrive they must be kept warm, but afterwards
most j will not need a heated shelter. They require plenty of air
and should be kept out of doors in fine weather, some even all the year
round. For food they should have boiled maize as their staple, chopped
dried figs, soaked currants, and sultanas, boiled potato, biscuit soaked
in sweetened milk, and cut up fruit. This last item, particularly banana,
is good for them, but not indispensable, and they can live on boiled
maize alone, from which it will be seen that they are not really difficult

to feed. To prevent their soiling their feathers, their food should be cut
up small and placed in small vessels, otherwise the feathers round the
beak will always be matted and dirty.
Aviary life suits these Pigeons best; they will go to nest in baskets
fastened high up against a wall, or fixed in shrubs. It is prudent to keep
pairs separate or only with very distinct species, as they are quarrel-
some among themselves, though harmless to other species of birds. Only
a few kinds have been bred in confinement, but this is because of their
rarity in our aviaries and bad housing, for they are very ready to go
to nest.
Fruit Pigeons are mostly found in the hotter parts of Asia and
Oceania, though some come from Africa. The sexes are in some cases
alike, but differ in others. Very few kinds, when it is borne in mind how
many there are in existence, have yet been imported. I have had about
a dozen all told.
We will now proceed to enumerate those species which we know
have been imported alive. But as their plumage is very variegated and
peculiarly shaded only a general idea can be given to enable the species
to be distinguished.
A
Green or Dove-like Fruit Pigeons ( Treronince ) are light green,
often variegated with other colours, one or more yellow stripes across
their wings, and thick beaks. Bound their eyes are two circles, one blue,
the other pink or orange. They are found in Asia, from India to Japan,
in the Philippines, and the Sondian Islands. The African genus also
belongs to this group. They are all of medium size, varying from that
of a Turtle Dove to a small domestic Pigeon.
The Purple-shouldered Fruit Pigeon (Crocopus phamicoptenis)
and its varieties are found from India to Annam. It is pale dull green,
with yellow under and on the tail coverts ; its abdomen and nape are
grey, and it has a violet blotch on the shoulder and a brownish collar.
Its beak and eyelids are blue, feet yellow&amp;quot;. Its tail is hardly rounded.
Occasionally imported. It has a pretty song, and is easily tamed if
taken from the nest. Mr. A. Ezra had a Lutino, light yellow all over.
C. p * chlorogaster from South and East India having a grey head has
also been imported.

The Waalia Fruit Pigeon ( Vinago waalia ), occurring from
Abyssinia to Western Africa, much resembles the above. It is light
olive green, with pale grey head, neck, and upper breast; the lower
breast is bright yellow. Its wings are a mixture of brown, yellow, and
wine-colour ; beak grey, red at the base ; feet reddish yellow.
The Great-billed Fruit Pigeon ( Vinago s. thomace), from
St. Thomas' Island, has also been imported.
The Bare-faced Fruit Pigeon (F. calva) from Equatorial, West,
and East Africa, has a bald and bulging forehead. It is olive with a
wide grey ring; its thighs and abdomen are yellow; the fold of the
wing vinous, beak like the preceding, yellow feet.
Delalande's Fruit Pigeon (F. delalandei) from East and South
Africa, is light green, with grey nape, vinous on the wing, and yellow
thighs ; its beak is grey and red, feet orange. In this and the preceding
species the sexes are alike.
The Treron are Asiatic and Malayan. They are common and often
go about in large flocks.
Treron capellii is large, with a very thick beak : it is light green
shading into grey, with russet sub-caudal feathers. The cock has an
orange breast. Feet and eyelids are yellow, the beak pale green. It is
a native of Malaya and the Sondian Isles.
The Hook-billed Fruit Pigeon (Treron curvirostra) and its
Eastern variety (T. c. nipalensis) are imported now and them. They can
be known by their large pale green beaks, red at the base, red feet, and
green eyelids. Their plumage is light green, shading into grey on the
head ; the cock has the shoulders and part of the back vinous brown.
The Parrot Fruit Pigeon (T. vernans) found from Tenasserim
to Borneo, is pale green with grey head, mauve neck, and in the cock
an orange breast. Its feet are red, eyelids and beak blue. This is a slight
species, as are the following :--
The Double-banded Fruit Pigeon (T. bicincta) inhabits India,
Indo-China, and Malaya. The cock resembles the preceding but for
his head and nape of neck being green.
The Pompadour Dove (T. pompadora) is like the preceding in
shape. The cock is green, with the crown of the head grey, an orange
blotch on the breast, shoulders, and back bright chestnut. Various

The Long-tailed Fruit-Pigeons (Sphenocercus) are recognized by
their long, graduated tails, which are very pointed with some species.
They do not flock like the other kinds, they are large and have very
melodious voices. S. sieboldi yellowish, green with white abdomen, is
often kept as a cage bird in Japan. S. sphenurus is also popular in
India on account of its song. It is fairly large, olive green, greyish
above, and the cock has purplish russet shoulders. It has been quite
often imported and Mr. Shore-Baily has bred it in his aviaries.
Phabotreron nigrorum from the Phillipines has been imported. It
is a brown Pigeon, shot with purple on its body, red and green on its
neck, a white line under its eye, and the upper part of its body tawny.

quite distinct, are usually confused. This article deals with the second,
and henceforth I propose to call those who maintain the affirmative

in various ways, are able to account for everything that happens in
breeding the birds, and that to some extent the factors which a bird
possesses, and its potentialities as a stock bird, are evident from its
appearance. The factorial compositions of some different varieties

Certain results follow from these postulates. A. bird obtains its colour
factors from one or other parent, or from both ; it cannot possess
a colour factor which they do not. For example, green birds can breed
only greens, yellows yellows, blues blues, and whites whites. In the
case of the F and 0 factors a single quantity causes full effect (to
outward appearance), while in the case of the B factor single quantity
causes intermediate effect. Consequently blues mated to greens
produce greens only, these being blue-bred, blues mated to blue-breds
&amp;apos; give 50% blues and 50% greens (blue-breds) ; blue-breds mated
to blue-breds yield 25% blues, 50% blue-breds, and 25% greens ;
and so on with all the different combinations. Cobalts mated to
cobalts may have, however, produce cobalts, mauves, or blues, the
inheritance here being intermediate.
Such in briefest outline is the theory, and I may say that for my part
I am indifferent as to whether it becomes established or not, that it
neither assists nor retards my own operations, and that the heat which
has been generated in the controversy has merely stimulated my sense
of humour.

There is, however, one first and last thing to do with a theory--
test it by the facts. The theorists claim that the evidence to date
offers the most convincing proof of the accuracy of their ideas, though
even here their initial enthusiasm has become tempered with caution.
They no longer claim that the theory " works out true in every clutch
when clutches are full 55 (by the way, what is a full clutch for
domesticated budgies ?) or that if two blue-breds are paired together
the breeder will obtain " provided eight eggs hatch, two blues." They
now maintain, with greater wisdom, that these figures only apply to
a large number of birds ; when small numbers are in question the
figures are subject to an error which can be calculated mathematically.
And, when it is remembered that from the standpoint of the theory,
16 birds bred from blue X blue-bred should comprise 8 blues and
8 greens, while the formula adopted will bring any number from 2 to 14
into line, it will be seen that the methematician has not lacked
generosity!
Concerning this idea of proportion in the young. If all the
Budgerigars bred, say, in Europe, from the mating blue X blue-bred
green were provided with duly authenticated birth certificates and an
accurate census taken, there would be a certain number of blues among
them, which numbe rwould form a definite percentage of the whole.
If this percentage proved to be 50, the theorist would regard it as
vindication, while his opponent could claim that it was the " law of
averages " demonstrating itself. If the percentage was not 50, the
scoffer would write finis, while the theorist would say that among
the unhatched eggs, or the young dead in nest would be a large
percentage of blues or greens, whichever colour suited him best, and
these, if they had materialized, would have rectified matters. Or he
might argue that insufficient birds had been taken into account, or
that the percentage needed adjustment but not the main idea, or that
some of the blue-breds were not blue-breds at all. Equally futile
is it for opponents of the theory to bring forward instances of greens
with pedigrees several generations strong, breeding blues. Pedigree
notwithstanding, says the theorist, these birds are really blue-breds,
or they could not breed blues ! They must have had a blue ancestor
or ancestors in the remote past. {Query .--What was the genesis of

the blue Budgerigar ?) Instances where the actual figures will not
conform even when the mathematician has " browsed " upon them
occasion the theorist no alarm. These are obviously extreme cases,
" continued breeding will correct them." Continued breeding failing
to accommodate, the numbers of birds are too small, or the
mathematician must " brighten his ideas The cases of blues mated
to blues and throwing greens or olives is more troublesome, in fact
the theorist is here distinctly out of form--" such exceptions are think-
able but do not contradict the theory."
This, of course, depends entirely on the point of view and an
extension of these performances will certainly occasion a good deal of
trouble to the theorist, and I commend to his notice certain results
from the 1928 breeding season. They come from my own aviaries,
but these are always open fco inspection, and many breeders are con-
versant with what takes place therein.
The theorist commonly declines to accept results obtained in aviaries,
on the ground that there is insufficient control of the matings. The
sceptic will admit that two birds confined in a cage must mate together
if they mate at all; at the same time he will point out that if this
inhibition were universally accepted, the great majority of matings
would be ineligible for consideration, and the theorist would be saved
the trouble of many awkward " explanations ". For as both sceptics
and theorists realize, always assuming they are reasonable beings,
results from aviaries are, under specified conditions, just as reliable
as results in cages.
Six pairs of birds occupied one of my aviaries last year--five white -
bred yellow cocks, one blue cock, four white hens and two white-
bred yellow hens. One white hen paired to the blue cock and produced
in three nests four blues and twelve whites. The theorist will at once
acclaim the blue as split white, but since its pedigree goes back to a time
when whites were unknown and there has been no introduction of
yellow in that period, the sceptic will certainly not be convinced.
A mesalliance with one of the yellow cocks is more promising, but even
then the number of whites would be abnormal. I am morally certain
it did not happen, but as I was on the spot, I of course know less about
it than anybody ! I would say here that none of the whites or yellows

showed any evidence of possessing the B factor even in single quantity,
the yellows being pale yellows and the whites having the familiar
blue shading on the back. Nevertheless, one of the white hens managed
to bring forth one mauve, one cobalt, 2 laurel greens, 2 whites, and 3
yellows, while one of the yellows produced a splendid olive, which
took second at the recent Crystal Palace Show. This is not " playing
the game ", since it does not give a chance of " explanation " ; at least
it leaves me none, so I will turn the problem over to the theorists.
The whites and yellows are of course in order (though one white had
cobalt shading), but the mauve, cobalt, olive, and laurel greens clean
bowl me. In another aviary were five blue cocks, four blue hens,
and one laurel green hen (blue-bred). In the previous season this
hen, mated to a similar cock, had bred nothing but laurel greens and
olives. The cock to which she paired was in his third breeding season,
had no white or yellow ancestry in his pedigree, and had previously
bred blues, greens, and laurel greens with regularity. The season's
toll from these two birds was 4 blues, 3 laurel greens, 2 yellows, and
3 whites. None of the cocks in this aviary was white-bred (or split
white if the theorist prefers it), but one of the blue hens had 4 whites
among her offspring. She had a white grandparent, but this is not
sufficient to explain her behaviour. Another pair (blue cock and
laurel green blue bred) in their second year of housekeeping bred
2 whites and 1 yellow, though nothing in their pedigrees or previous
breeding records would have led one to expect it. All the cocks in
the aviary were blue except one cobalt, and one can only ruminate on
the perversity of Budgerigars.
At the end of the 1927 season I called attention to a pair of yellows
with no evidence of being split white, which had bred during the season
8 whites and 10 yellows. Evidence notwithstanding, the theorist
had no difficulty in deciding that these birds were in fact split white,
and as to the abnormal number of whites another season's breeding
would correct this. The further season's breeding has produced
5 whites and 5 yellows, and I will again leave it to the theorist.
Out of the 10 yellows bred in 1927,1 kept 7 for my own observation,
and these were mated to a variety of partners. Every one produced
whites, and the same thing occurred with one I disposed of ; the other

two I have not traced. This is scarcely " running true to form
Every one of the whites has produced white youngsters, no matter
what it mated to.
During the 1927 season I mated a yellow cock bred from the blue X
blue-bred olive parentage (which itself does not conform to theory)
to a green hen bred from the white, blue-bred olive cross. They reared
only one nest of youngsters--2 blues, 1 yellow, 1 green. These
youngsters were mated to various coloured partners and every one
bred whites. They really had no business to breed any at all ! Some
years ago I was informed by a breeder who had himself produced a
white strain that it was his common practice to mate a white to a bird
of any other colour, and the youngsters from this cross mated to any
Budgerigar he chose, bred whites. At the time, I took this as
gentle " leg-pulling ", but a few years more experience has left me
wondering if he was not, after all, quite serious ; for certainly the
performances of these birds have been altogether beyond expectations
and cut right across the ideas of our theorist friends.
Many times during the last few years I have bred yellow birds from
the blue, blue-bred olive cross, and olive birds from blue and laurel
green parents, results which I cannot reconcile with the hypotheses
of the theorists.
It is widely known by now, I should think, that if for example
blues and blue-breds are allowed to breed among themselves, certain
pairs will produce an abnormal number of blues and others an abnormal
number of greens. If anyone else has followed this up systematically,
it would be useful to compare results.
I do not at the moment see how the breeder of exhibition Budgerigars
can gain any material advantage from the application of these theories
of colour breeding, though the results of the wide scale operations
now going on may quite likely be of great value in other directions.
My own conclusions are that this theory is either built on insecure
foundations and therefore unstable, or must be considered in conjunction
with other factors which are supplementary or act in antagonism to it.
Which view is correct the future will doubtless reveal.

By A. A. Prestwick
The Grand National Show at the Crystal Palace on the 7th, 8th,
and 9th February, was a great success as regards entries, there being
some 240 in the 33 classes. The exhibits were more numerous than
last year, but taken as a whole they lacked the rarity which we have
become accustomed to expect at the " Palace ". There were, neverthe-
less, some every interesting birds on view. To the great disappointment
of all, Mr. Whitley did not send his usual large consignment; also
the entries of Lord Tavistock and Mrs. Victor Cooper were conspicuous
by their absence. Fortunately there were several new exhibitors,
notably the Rev. R. B. Abell, Dr. G. Elphick, and Capt. H. H. Liddell-
Grainger, all of whom sent large teams. Mr. C. T. Maxwell made a very
welcome reappearance, and his numerous successes included the
winning of the " Grand National " silver medal for the best foreign
bird in the show, namely, Wilson's Bird of Paradise. As usual,
Mr. John Frostick was well to the fore.
Several exhibitors were heard to complain of the chilliness of the
hall, the improvements in the heating arrangements apparently not
being up to their expectations. We feel, however, that their criticisms
were more or less justified. The temperature was considerably higher
than in previous years, and none of the exhibits appeared unduly
distressed, but then the majority of the entries were fairly hardy
species and did not require much heat. There is still ample scope
for the " Palace " engineers to further improve their heating
system. The nature of the building precludes anything like a constant
and agreeable temperature, and we do not think that the conditions
at the " Palace " will ever be such that " even the most delicate species
can be sent with perfect safety ". The lighting left much to be desired,
and there is need of better staging--some of the smaller birds being
very difficult to see. Surely the small cages, at least, could be staged
in the same way as the other sections.
The show was under the managership of Mr. A. J. Platon, who
proved himself a worthy successor to Mr. A. W. Smith.

74 A. A. Prestwick -- The Foreign Birds at the Crystal Palace
The " Parrot " classes were singularly devoid of interest and
contained little of note. The class for Lories and Lorikeets, etc.,
contained nine entries and was won by Mr. Frostick's veteran Yellow-
backed Lory male ; a good pair of Swainson's sent by Mr. W. Atkin
gained second, and third was awarded to a pair of Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrakeets (Mr. J. Tokinchi Otaki). Mr. Frostick also sent
his pair of cage-bred Swainson's. Lovebirds, etc., was an even class,
first going to Mr. Maxwell's Peach-faced; Dr. Elphick's Fischer's
being second, and Mr. H. J. Wiltshire's Black-cheeks third. There
were three entries of Peach-faced--a species more numerous now than
for several years ; Black-cheeks on the other hand, are rapidly becoming
more scarce. The class for Brotogerys, etc., was devoid of entries.
Mr. Maxwell won the class for Cockatiels, Bed Bosellas, Bedrumps,
etc., with a smart pair of Bedrumps ; second went to Mr. H. W. Simpson
for a Bed Bosella, third to Mr. A. E. Boblin for an Indian Bing-neck,
and fourth to Mr. Wiltshire for a pair of Bedrumps. There were but
two entries in the class for the smaller Macaws and more common
Gonures; Mr. Frostick was first with a Golden-headed Conure and
Mr. F. W. Mattingley second with a pair of Half-moon Gonures.
Common King, Pennant's, Crimson-winged, etc., was another poorly
supported class--only four entries. Capt. Liddell-Grainger's Bauers
fully deserved their first prize ; a good Bed-vented Blue Bonnet male
sent by Mr. F. B. Child was second, and Mr. Frostick's Barnard third
Mr. L. W. Hawkins sent the only exhibit in the class for " All other
species of Parrakeets and Conures ", namely, a Queen of Bavaria
Conure--not in the best of plumage, but deserving of competition.
This class is usually the most interesting in the section, and frequently
contains the best bird in the show, but this year it was a complete
failure. The next class for Grey, Timneh, Senegal, and various
specified Amazons provided another win for Mr. Maxwell, his very
excellent Bupell's Parrot being in perfect condition; second went to
Mr. Frostick's Plain-coloured Amazon--Lorita "--which was in
great evidence as a u talker " ; third and fourth prizes went to Mr. W.
Poole for a Timneh and a Grey respectively.
All species of White and Bose-breasted Cockatoos were represented
by a single pair of Eastern Miniature sent by Mr. Frostick. Another

win was recorded by Mr. Maxwell in the class for " All other species
of Cockatoos and Macaws", his Lear's Macaw leading his Salmon-
crested Cockatoo ; the rest of the class being composed of numerous
Sulphur-crested Cockatoos entered by the Crystal Palace Trustees.

<bodyText confidence="0.984302413793103" page_id="56215761"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
The last Parrot class, that for all other species, was a failure. Mr. W.
Poole was first with his Eed-sided Eclectus male, and Capt. Hammond
Second with a good Short-tailed Parrot. Only one pair of birds
materialized for the hybrid class, consisting of Common Grey X St.
Helena Waxbills bred by Mr. P. W. Teague.
In the class for Quails, Partridges, Pigeons, efcc., Mr. Fro stick was
first with a pair of Australian Plumed Ground Doves ; a pair of Diamond
Doves gained second for Mr. W. H. Potter, and third went to a Chinese
Painted Quail sent by Mrs. A. L. Bruce. The next three classes
for various common seed-eaters, were won by Combasous (Capt. Liddell-
Grainger), Cordon Bleus (J. H. Pranklin), and White Java Sparrows
(W. P. Maker).
First and second prizes in the Common Grass-Finch class were taken
by Mr. Willshire with a splendid pair of Diamond Finches and a single
Heck's Long-tailed Grass-Finch ; third prize was awarded to Mr. J.
Cranna for another good pair of Diamond Finches. The class for the
rarer Grass Finches and rarer Waxbills contained seventeen entries,
and was won deservedly by Mr. A. Martin's Violet-eared Waxbill ;
second and third going to pairs of Peter's Spotted Fire Finches shown
by Mr. Frostick and Mrs. H. C. Humphries respectively. No less than
five pairs of this very beautiful, and hitherto almost unknown, species
were in this class. Fourth prize was gained by Mr. Frostick's Jameson's
Fire Finches. Mr. P. W. Beauchamp won the class for Buntings,
Siskins, etc., with a very good Golden-breasted Bunting ; Mr. Cranna
was second with Red Siskins, and Capt. Hammond third with a Gay's
Finch. This class contained a pair of " Mystery " birds sent by
Mr. Andrew Wilson, and a single sent by Mr. Beauchamp : in both cases
the birds had been caught at sea. They proved to be no great rarities
the former being North American Snow-birds and the latter a North

This year the Weaver and Whydah class received more support
than hitherto, there being seven entries. A Buff-crowned Whydah
gained the premier award for Mr. L. W. Hawkins ; second prize was
given to Mr. Allison's Hapoleon Weaver, and third to Capt. Liddell-
Grainger's Crimson-crowned Weaver.
The class for Common Tanagers was the best seen for many years,
there being seventeen entries--over half of which were sent by our
member, the Rev. R. B. Abell. First prize was given to Mr. Cranna
for a very fine Superb ; the Rev. Abell took second and third for Palm
and Ornate. Amongst the rare Tanagers and Sugar-birds, Mr. Frostick
was first and third with a Yellow-winged Sugar-bird and a pair of
Indian Zosterops, the gap being filled by a pair of Tanagers, sent by
Mr. Maxwell. They are as yet unidentified, but the Rev. Abell, who
also sent a pair, believes them to be the Blue-bellied. Fourth prize
went to the Rev. Abell for a good Cayenne.
There was but one Sunbird, a fine Southern Malachite belonging
to Mr. A. Martin. The Robins were a good pair of American Blue
Birds, which won first for Capt. L. R. Waud, and four pairs of Pekins,
the best of which were those shown by Miss I. Hebbert and Mr. C. 0.
Heine.
There were eight entries of Shamas in the class for Shamas and
Clarinos. Of the former octet, Mr. W. Jarratt's bird was the best,
gaining second prize. First and third were awarded to Mr. Maxwell
and Mr. Frostick for two excellent Clarinos. The Glossy Starlings
and Spreos were a comparatively poor class; of the four entries Mr. C. S.
Dunstan's Purple-headed Glossy was far ahead of the others;
Mr. Simpson was awarded second for a pair of Green Glossy, and
Dr. Elphick third for a pair of Spreos.
The all species of Mynahs, Fruit-suckers, Jay-thrushes, etc., was
won by Mr. Beauchamp's Golden-fronted Fruit-sucker, the only other
exhibit being Mr. J. R. Thomson's White-crested Jay-thrush. Eleven
exhibits were staged in the class for Hangnests, Troupials, etc., the
best being a pair of Mexican Troupials sent by Dr. Elphick; second,
Mr. L. Sutton's Yellow-crowned Hangnest; third and fourth, Capt.

Hammond's Yellow-rumped and Black Cassiques. The last-named
exhibitor also sent an unnamed Troupial, probably the Golden-crowned :
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998191352941176" page_id="56215763"  page_num="77" year="" vol="">
and Mr. Frostick a Hangnest which appeared to be an immature
Black-throated. Dr. Elphick also won the class for Pies, Jays, Barbets,
Toucans, etc., with a good pair of Mexican Blue-crested Jays; his
pair of Alpine Choughs gained second ; and a fine Green Toucanette
secured third for Mr. Maxwell. There were three Birds of Paradise,
the first prize-winner being Mr. Maxwell's Wilson's, adjudged the best
foreign bird in the show. A good Bed was second (Mr. Maxwell),
and a Greater third (Mr. Goodwin). The two remaining classes were
for " All other species of insectivorous and fruit-eating birds c smaller
than ' and 4 larger than ' a Silver-eared Mesia ", The former was won
by Mr. Goodwin's rare Chestnut-capped Buarremon (Atlapetes
pileatus )--the first shown; second went to Mr. Dunstan's Rufous-
bellied Niltava, winner of many premier honours ; third to Mr. Allison's
Bush Chat, and fourth to a smart little unidentified Woodpecker
belonging to Mr. Maxwell. The last class was won by Mr. Maxwell
with a new species of Tanager, possibly the Black-throated or Red-
capped ; this bird was a male. The Rev. Abell gained third with a
pair of the same species, his chance being spoilt by a rather rough
female lacking a large portion of her tail. Capt. Hammond gained
second and fourth with a Black-necked Saltator and a Pitta.
The foreign section was judged by Mr. D. Seth-Smith and Mr. Allen
Silver. This year they exchanged classes, so that Mr. Seth-Smith
judged the majority of the seed-eater and insectivorous classes and
Mr. Silver the Parrots and some seed-eaters. No adverse comments
were heard, so presumably the experiment was a success. At the
Judge's luncheon, Mr. Silver was called on to respond to the toast
to the Judges--a task he carried through in his usual inimitable manner.
A definite movement is on foot to include the ubiquitous Budgerigar
amongst the domesticated species. By many the universal favourite
is no longer considered an alien, so that possibly at some future date
M. undulatus, and its various colour varieties, may join the Canary
and pass outside the scope of the Avicultural Society. Hence, we do
not propose going into details of the exhibits. It must suffice to state
that there were 252 entries in the 14 classes--that for Blues containing

no less than 47. There were some good birds in each class and a few
were excellent, but many were exceedingly poor, and stood little chance
of being " placed ". It was obvious that some of the exhibitors had
not the remotest idea of what is required in a show Budgerigar, according
to the standards of the Budgerigar Club. Presumably the recent bad
weather was responsible- for the lack of form of numerous exhibits.
The best bird in the section was a very fine cobalt sent by Mrs.&amp;apos;D. E.
Wall, who is to be congratulated on her success. Mr. R. J. Watts
carried out his difficult duty with conspicuous skill and further enhanced
his reputation as a judge.
A very interesting " sport " was sent from Germany by Mr. C.
Balser. Given a cursory glance this bird appeared to be a good blue
male, but on closer inspection--when the bird turned round and faced
right--it was remarkable in that the whole of the right flank and a large
portion of the chest, for the entire length of the bird were a pure green.
The rump and back were the usual blue, but there were small green
areas round the vent and tail-coverts. In addition--on the green
side--there was a splash of yellow on the white of the throat, and
another on the head pencilling. We understand that there is a some-
what similar female at Blanchards. In the latter bird, however,
the whole of one side is blue and the other green.

AVIARIES FOR PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995478740740741" page_id="56215765"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The reference to change of top-soil as a substitute for aviary-
moving, made in your very kind review of my book, leads me to send
the following explanatory notes as being possibly of some general
interest.
For about seven years my collection of psittacine birds were housed
in the Isle of Wight in fixed aviaries which were annually re-turfed as
suggested. The district, judged by the percentage of losses from what
I may term " uncontrollable " illnesses--chills, pneumonia, and fatty
degeneration of the internal organs, in spite of prudent feeding--
was a normally healthy one for birds. For the next seven years the
collection was housed in somewhat larger movable aviaries in a very
unhealthy district, where Budgerigars and Zebra Finches die quicker
than they breed and even a domestic Ancona Fowl, not reared on the
place, never survives a moult either in a pen or on free range.
During the closing years of the birds' sojourn on the Isle of Wight
it was quite impossible to get Many-colours, Blue-bonnets, or Yellow-
bellied Parrakeets to live for more than a few months. Although the
aviaries were lightly stocked with a pair of birds in each, these
susceptible species invariably fell victims to septicaemia, septic fever,
or tuberculosis and I was obliged to give them up as hopeless. In fixed
aviaries at Warblington, Blue-bonnets also died within a year from
septicaemia, proving that the same germ is in this district. Since putting
the birds into movable aviaries I have never lost the above-mentioned
species from the above-mentioned complaints. Yellow-bellies are no
more trouble than any other Broadtails. Blue-bonnets I have only had
for a few months, but they remained free from serious illness all the time.
Many-colours did not do well, and several were lost from chills,

pneumonia, and fatty degeneration, but some did at least rear healthy
young, and all kept free from the original scourges. One pair are still
living in a friend's aviary in a healthier district after about seven years'
captivity, which is nothing to boast of, though probably a record seldom
reached by the species in this country. In the fixed aviaries the young
Ringnecks bred were nearly all degenerate--infertile and often more or
less deformed. Those reared in movable aviaries from the same parents
(apart from some that were victims of unsuitable nests) have been
perfect. The only large cock Broadtail I bred in the fixed aviaries--
a Barnard--proved sterile. Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets reared in the
fixed aviaries were degenerate. Some lost all their flights at once. The
cocks were sterile, and no hen survived the laying and incubation of
her first clutch of eggs. In the movable aviaries, although the imported
adults did much worse, owing to the unhealthiness of the district,
falling victims to pneumonia and chills, such young as were reared were
perfect, and one of the infertile cocks above mentioned became
serviceable for breeding. I can only explain the rather puzzling failure
of change of top-soil to produce results equal to change of site on the
following hypothesis.
During the course of a year the entire soil of an aviary flight receives
a very heavy contribution of droppings from the birds that inhabit it.
If you put a pair of Parrakeets into a 24 ft. aviary in dry weather when
the soil of the flight is bare, it is astonishing how much dirt will be
visible at the end of a week. At the end of a year the deposit would
probably be not much less than some lbs. to the square foot. In ordinary
weather the extent of the fouling is not very apparent as the droppings
are washed down into the soil by the rain. But if it be true that there is
any virture in cleanliness because the excreta of animals tend to breed
bacilli injurious to the health of animals, then the state of the aviary
is not so harmless as it appears. To a depth of several feet the soil,
as a result of successive rains, is more or less impregnated with droppings
and their attendant bacilli. When you re-turf the aviary you merely
superimpose on a bed of soil deeply contaminated a foot or less of
clean earth. Is it unreasonable to assume that the microbes quickly
work back through this upper layer and leave you as badly off
as before ? Tavistock.

THE BLUE MASKED LOVEBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987089896551724" page_id="56215767"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I am interested in your note in the January number on the
above, but I fear as this bird is most probably a sport, the Mendel
Laws will not work out, for this theory a Blue should be bred from pure
Blues for a few generations.
I should advise pairing him this season to another common Masked
hen, and then breeding from the young of both hens in 1930. Of course,
the young can be paired together this season, to try for the 25 per cent.
When I first produced Blue Budgerigars all I had to work on was a
Green hen, three-eighths blue, three-eighths green, a quarter yellow. A
bird from this hen and a selected common Green cock, paired to a bird
from the same hen and another selected cock paired together produced
Blues.
I am not surprised with your results in Budgerigar breeding ;
several friends and myself find that if the Blues are bred from Blues
for several generations, and the Greens are a good strain of Blue-breds
you get nearer 75 per cent than 50 per cent. In fact, I have had a nest
of five Blues from a pair of Blue-bred Greens.
Where a large number of pairs of unknown pedigree are bred from,
very often the 25 per cent and 50 per cent works out; the good pedigree
birds making up for the ones of bad or no pedigree. In breeding
Budgerigars, like breeding any other stock, I trust to pedigree
every time.
John W. Marsden.
[The first Blue Budgerigar was nothing more than a " sport ", but
from this the whole race of Blue Budgerigars has been produced.
Whether the progeny from the Blue Lovebird, mated to a normally
coloured bird will prove to be heterozygotes and produce 25 per cent
of Blue young remains to be proved, but we shall be very surprised if
Mendel's Laws fail here.-- Ed.]

youngsters came out of nest for first time 13th December, 1928, and on
the 20th December left the nest for good. For the first two or three
nights afterwards the two old birds slept on the perch with their babies--
one on each side and covered them with outstretched wing--quite a
pretty sight. Now the young ones are almost as large and beautiful
as the old ones ; the beaks, black at first, are getting redder every
day. They are perfectly charming and we are, of course, very delighted
that we have done something that probably no one else has done in a
small open-wire, wagon-shaped, cage--30 in. long, 28 in. high, 15 in. wide!
The young have been reared on exactly the same food as the old ones--
no extras--and are, in my opinion, as good in every way as any ever
bred in freedom.
The parents have gone to nest again, and are now sitting on two
eggs laid on the 19th and 21st January, 1929.

<bodyText confidence="0.983221277777778" page_id="56215768"  page_num="82" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Owing to lack of room I am obliged to part with two of my
hybrid Sula Island King X Crimson-winged Parrakeets--a 1927 cock
and one of 1928. The younger is a trained day-liberty bird and the
older one could be trained without the slightest risk or trouble. I
should be pleased to give one to any member who would get him a
mate and fly him at liberty.
Any female Aprosmictine or Polytetine Parrakeet would do as a
companion--Crimson-wing for choice ; otherwise, King, Rock Peplar,
or Barraband. These hybrids are very attractive birds and although
not yet in fully adult plumage are of exceptional beauty--very rich,
dark green with blue rumps, crimson thighs and abdomens, and red
caps and red throats. They are very lively and intelligent and very
hardy, never having had a day's illness or any artificial heat since they
were hatched. The two-year-olds will feed from the hand if one is
outside the aviary, and the young bird follows me about, when loose,
and will come within a few feet for a peanut.
It it a little difficult to say whether they would be safe from Owls
if allowed to roost in the open. The two-year-olds are more powerful

birds than Crimson-wings, which Brown Owls take, but not as large
as Common Kings, which are left alone. If it were decided not to risk
them out at night a roosting aviary would have to be arranged along-
side the breeding aviary occupied by the hens.
It is difficult to say whether these hybrids would be fertile. In all
probability they would be, as their parents are fairly closely allied.

In 1927 the experiment was made of taking Nightingales to New
Zealand. They survived the voyage and were liberated on Christmas
Day, 1927, after considerable trouble from the authorities, who feared
that any alien avian importation might cause trouble, presumably
by eating their crops or killing their sheep ! It was feared that these
birds would migrate and no one knew where they would go to, and
the possibility of their returning seemed remote. However, they,
or at least one of them, has apparently done so, for Mr. Angus Wilson,
who took them out, writes to me that one has been heard singing,
a year after its liberation, in the vicinity of Auckland.
Those of us who have seen or heard the wonderful Lyre Bird in
its native haunts, either in National Park, near Sydney, or near
Melbourne, will read with interest an exhaustive article on this unique
bird, by Dr. J. A. Leach, in the January number of the Emu. It is
very satisfactory to hear that it still exists in some numbers within
its somewhat limited range in South-Eastern Australia, and much
interest is taken there in its protection by the inhabitants.
When I was in Australia twenty years ago I spent some delightful
days in the haunts of the Lyre Bird, and not only frequently heard
its rich note but was able to watch the bird itself. But at that time
the horrible slaughter of these birds was still going on in order to provide
tails as ornaments ! This traffic is now definitely put a stop to, and
the bird is absolutely protected as it should have been long ago.

Avicultural Notes
A project is on foot to introduce the Lyre Bird into Tasmania,
where the fox, which has been very destructive on the mainland, does
not exist. The conditions in parts of Tasmania would seem to be
ideal for this species, and the necessary expenses have been provided.
The Tasmanian Government has undertaken not only to permit the
importation of the birds but to render all assistance and protection
possible. We shall look forward with great interest to hearing of the
successful accomplishment of the introduction, which should give one
of the most interesting birds in the world a new lease of life.
A member would like to know what is the natural length of life of
small birds such as Waxbills, etc. ? It is a question that is not easily
answered, but we may be sure that very few birds attain to their normal
limit under captive conditions. But neither do they in a state of
Nature where their natural enemies are constantly on the alert. To
obtain some idea of the natural limit of life of a small bird one naturally
takes the Canary as an example. A Canary or Goldfinch is an old
bird at twelve to fourteen years, and one would expect a Weaver or
Singing-Finch to reach this age, but a Waxbill would probably attain
to little more than half this, while a Parrot would probably more than
double it.
POEMS ON BIRDS, FOR CHILDREN
Many children love poetry and many also love birds, and Mrs.
Currey's delightful little book of poems about birds, especially written
for children, will appeal to the younger generation of bird-lovers. It
contains poems on some fifty well-known birds, and we can heartily
recommend it to parents, who will find much pleasure in reading it to
their children. It is published, at the modest price of 4s., by
Messrs. Stephen Austin and Sons, of Hertford.

The Ptilonopinse are a large family of Oceanic Islands birds, some
of which extend as far as to Malay. They are the brightest coloured of
all Pigeons. As a rule deep green is their predominant colour, mingled
with other bright hues. The hens are usually altogether green and
do not resemble the cocks.
About a dozen species have been imported alive so far as we know,
but the list lengthens every year. It is much to be wished that still
more should come over, for they are not difficult to keep in health and
show inclination to nest.
We will briefly describe those species which we have observed in
aviaries, but it is quite probable that others have been imported.
The Jambu Fruit Pigeon (Ptilinops jambu) from Melanesia is most
commonly imported and is one of the most beautiful; it is dark green
with carmine head, white sided neck, and a pink spot on the breast.
The under parts are yellowish white in the cock bird ; the hen is green.
Leclancher's Fruit Pigeon (P. leclancheii) from the Philippines
is green, with greyish white head and neck and black chin. The hen
is green.

Perouse's Fruit Pigeon (P. perousi) found in Samoa and the
Fiji Islands is green with bronze spots on the wings. The crown of
the head is purplish red ; cheeks and throat yellowish green ; its
breast is dappled pale grey with green ; abdomen yellowish ; the
sub-caudal feathers purplish pink.
The Banded Fruit Pigeon (P. fasciatus ) also found in Samoa has
the crown of the head rose violet; the neck and under parts pale
greenish yellow, green above ; the sub-caudals tawny yellow.
The Purple-crowned Fruit Pigeon (P. porphyraceus) from Fiji
and Tonga, is rather dark green with neck and breast light ashy green,
the forehead and crown of the head lilac pink, surrounded by a faint
yellow line and yellow sub-caudals. The sexes are alike.
The Superb Fruit Pigeon (P. superbus), found in North Australia,
New Guinea and the Moluccas, is one of the finest species of the genus.
The cock has a red-purple crown, sides and nape of the neck coppery
red ; the front of the neck and upper breast greyish white, succeeded
by a black line shot with blue. White abdomen ; upper part of the body
green mingled with blue and yellow in the wings, green tail with grey
tip. The hen is green, grey and green underneath, and has a blue
spot on her head.
The Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeon (P. coronulatus) is a small
species from the Aru Islands and New Guinea, is golden green with
rose lilac crown passing into purple on the nape and surrounded by a
narrow yellow line ; it has a violet spot in the middle of its abdomen ;
yellow sub-caudals and yellow in its wings. This most charming pigeon
has been bred for several years by Captain Stokes in an outdoor aviary
having a heated shelter. His birds nest in boxes hanging on the walls
of the shelter ; they lay only one egg to a clutch ; incubation lasts
eighteen days, and the young leave the nest while still very small,
but able to fly, when about twelve to fifteen days old. They are fed
on fruit and Savoy biscuits soaked in Nestle's milk.
The Orange-bellied Fruit Pigeon (P. iozonus) from the same
localities is vivid green with a large orange spot on the abdomen.
The sexes are alike.
Wallace's Fruit Pigeon (P. wallacei), found in the Aru and
neighbouring islands, has the crown of the head purple red ; neck,

breast and upper back light grey, a white crescent on the breast,
succeeded by orange russet; the tips of the wings and back grey
dappled with bronzy green ; wings and tail green variegated with
yellow.
The Purple-bellied Fruit Pigeon (P. bellus) is dark green, with
purple crown and middle abdomen, and a wide light yellow crescent
on its breast. It is a native of New Guinea.
The Ornamented Fruit Pigeon (P. ornatus ) and the allied form
P. o. gestroi from the same place are green, with a yellow band across
the tail, pale yellow sub-caudals ; breast and collar yellowish brown,
a purple and grey spot on the shoulders, and a pearly grey line from beak
to nape. The type has a reddish purple crown, while the variety has
a greenish yellow one.
The Black-headed Fruit Pigeon (P. melanocephala), of which
there are several forms from Java to Celebes, has lately been imported
in some quantity. It is green with black crown ; the rest pearly grey
as is also its neck, and chin, with pale yellow throat. Its sub-caudals
are yellow and red. The hen is green.
The Magnificent Fruit Pigeon (Megaloprepia magnified) from
East Australia, and its varieties found in the Oceanic islands, well
deserve their name. It is a splendid bird, about the size and shape of
a Eock Pigeon ; it has a grey head ; the upper parts golden green
with yellow on the wings. Its neck is green, with a band of glowing
purple red which widens and covers the breast and upper abdomen,
the rest being yellow ; its tail is green. The sexes are alike.
The Wart Pigeons (Alectroenas) are peculiar to Madagascar and
the neighbouring islands. One species from the Seychelles (Alectroenas
pulcherrima), the Eed-crowned Wart Pigeon, has been imported. It is
of medium size, with a short square tail, fine deep blue, having its neck
ornamented with pearly grey slender pointed feathers, and bright red
vertex ; between beak and eyes vermilion caruncles. The sexes are
alike.
This handsome species bred in 1917 in my aviaries at Villers-
Bretonneux in the open air. Only one egg was laid in each clutch.
The young grew very quickly and were fed on boiled potatoes and rice,
crushed hemp and fruit. The young plumage is dark grey barred with

light grey. These Pigeons must be kept in the open, for they soon perish
if kept indoors. They are very spiteful and it is difficult to make a
pair agree together.
The Carpopjiagince come pretty near to the true Pigeons of the genus
Columba, but they are shorter in the leg and heavier in build.
They are very large, as big as our Wood Pigeons or bigger, with
square, rather long tails. They live on fruit and berries like the
preceding species. They are very hardy in confinement and do well
on boiled corn and potato. They will also eat some uncooked grain.
Most species have pale grey or tawny heads, necks, and upper parts of
the body, rather light green mantles, more or less dull, with brilliant
metallic reflections and purplish red legs and feet. The sexes are alike.
About fifteen species have been imported.
The Globicera are distinguished by a fleshy protuberance at the
base of the beak.
The Pacific Fruit Pigeon (G. pacifica) found from Samoa to New
Guinea, has a light grey head, the under parts are pale vinous, the
mantle bronze green, a dark grey tail and chestnut sub-caudals. Its
feet are red, beak and caruncle black.
The Russet-throated Fruit Pigeon (G. rufigula) from the Solomon
Islands is like the above, but has a grey mantle, cheeks and throat and
breast vinous deepening to chestnut on the abdomen.
The Imperial Fruit Pigeon ( Muscadivora cenea) is very common
from India to Malaya and the Philippines. It has no caruncle like its
fellows ; it is pale grey, slightly vinous, with bronze green mantle
and grey tail. The sub-species from India and Indo-China is most
frequently imported, M. ce. sylvatiea , which is grey and not vinous.
The Nicobar Fruit Pigeon (M. ce . insularis) is really only a race
of the Imperial, lacking the rosy tinge on head and upper parts. It
nested in the Zoological Gardens of London, but did not rear the young.
The 7uOM Fruit Pigeon (M. zoce) of New Guinea differs from the
above in having a grey head and belly and red neck.
The Pauline Fruit Pigeon ( M. paulina) of Celebes is rosy grey
above and its nape and behind the neck is coppery chestnut. The
mantle is similar to the preceding.
The Moluccan Fruit Pigeon (M. concinna) closely resembles the

Pauline, but the nape is only tinged with red. The Figiian species
(M. latrans) is vinous grey above deepening to russet on the abdomen.
Wharton's Fruit Pigeon (M. whartoni ) is darker and has nape
and occiput bronzy green as well as the back; forehead, head, crown,
its cheeks and throat are dark grey, and its under parts are vinous
purple.
The Spectacle Fruit Pigeon (M. perspicillata) from Halmaheira
has a dark slate coloured head and neck with a white streak round
the eyes and on the forehead ; its neck behind and the mantle are
metallic green. The under parts are pale grey.
Finsche's Fruit Pigeon (M. finschi), found in New Ireland, differs
from all the above by having a barred tail, blue at the root, ashy grey
and then black. Its head and neck vinous grey ; breast and belly
chestnut; mantle coppery green ; blue flights. Its importation is
uncertain.
Mueller's Fruit Pigeon ( M . muelleri), coming from the Aru
islands and South New Guinea has a vinous grey crown, white chin and,
throat and occipital collar followed by a wide black collar ; the throat
in front and upper breast are pale grey ; the back is vinous red, mantle
slaty grey ; the under parts are vinous red ; tail dark grey, with a light
grey subterminal band.
M. pinon, of New Guinea and the neighbouring islands, has a slaty
grey mantle ; a white line round the beak and eyes ; lower back and
breast purplish chestnut; head and neck vinous grey, carmine red feet;
and eyes set in coral.
The White Fruit Pigeons ( Myristicivora ) are found among wooded
coasts chiefly on small islands from the Andamans to Australia. In
shape and habits they are like the preceding.
Myristicivora bicolor has a wide range and is fairly often imported.
It is creamy white and had black tips to its wings and tail, as well as
black spots on the sub-caudal feathers ; its beak and feet are lead
colour. It is strong and hardy. Its variety (spilorrhea) inhabiting
Australia and New Guinea, has more and more widely spread black
spots under its tail. Another variety (luctuosa) from Celebes has
slaty grey flights fringed with black. The typical forms are mostly
found in the west. By feeding on certain mixtures the creamy colour of

these Pigeons may be made paler or accentuated until it becomes
almost orange.
The Double-crested Pigeon (Lopholcemus antarcticus) from Eastern
Australia, has a large crest in front, covering the head, which is
prolonged by a russet one at the back ; the rest of its plumage is grey,
light underneath, almost black above. Its beak is pink and feet red.

" De gustibus non est disputandum there is no accounting for tastes,
runs the old Latin saying and it would appear to apply to birds quite
as much as men. When I was training the cock Brown&amp;apos;s Parrakeet
to the use of the feeding box previous to allowing him full liberty, it
did occur to me, knowing, as I do, a Broadtail's love of fighting, that
he might have a few scraps, but I confess I did not anticipate a gladia-
torial show pure and unrelieved. Before his release he had spent several
weeks in solitary confinement ever since he had very nearly murdered
his wife for no better reason than that he had been separated from her
for a few days while undergoing treatment for a slight chill. As during
the summer she had been the mother of his three, children, I hoped that
in common decency the first use he would make of his freedom would be
to go and apologize to her, as every well-conducted Brown's is mono-
gamous and pairs for life. Failing that I thought he might pay his
addresses to an unmated female of his species who had been ogling
him from the next aviary but one.
But I was mistaken on both counts ; as soon as he was out of the
aviary, turning a deaf ear to the calls of the two hens, he made a bee-line
for the Yellow-mantle's aviary on the opposite side of the field : it
was not love for which his soul had thirsted, but war. Cock Kosellas
vary considerably in pugnacity and prowess, and my present Yellow-
mantle happens to be a particularly aggressive bird, almost the equal
of old " Joseph " who was the supreme tyrant of the garden many
years ago. He and the Brown's went at it hammer and tongs. After a
few rounds the latter discovered that he was scarcely a match for the

bigger bird in close fighting but still he would not dream of leaving him
in peace and kept dodging round and round the aviary, challenging him
and only avoiding his angry swoops &amp;t the latest possible moment.
About midday the Brown's transferred his attention to the breeding
pair of Yellow-rumps, both of which were shut up. Usually half-inch
mesh will prevent big Parrakeets from doing each other serious harm,
but where there's a will there's a way, and when I came round in the
early afternoon the Yellow-rump was sitting sulkily on a perch with
a bleeding leg tucked up, while the Brown's hurled insults at him from
outside. He continued this pastime for the next hour until the unfortu-
nate Yellow-rump was goaded by the taunts of the foe and the reproaches
of his wife to forget his wound and renew the fray. (I may say that my
own efforts to drive the Brown's off were wholly unavailing.) Up and
down the wire the combatants manoeuvred and at last the Yellow-
rump saw his chance and the defiant whistling of the Brown's changed
to a dismal screeching as his enemy got the grip for which he had been
waiting and hung on. Richly as I felt the Brown's deserved all the
punishment he got I interfered to prevent the infliction of a fatal
injury. When the Yellow-rump let go of him blood was pouring
from his beak, from, we afterwards discovered, a deep bite in the
tongue. But even then he had not had enough, and though he treated
his opponent with more respect for the next few minutes he still would
not leave the aviary. The Yellow-rump realized very well that he
had&amp;apos;scored in the last round, and it was surprising with what an increase
of energy and confidence, despite his wounded leg, he flung himself at the
wire wherever the Brown's settled : "I made you squeal that time,
all right," he was clearly saying, " and if I had not been interrupted
you would not have got off so easily." However the Brown's managed
to give him a bite on the forehead before deciding to retire for a brief
rest to the top of an adjacent aviary. I really did hope that he might
then turn his thoughts towards supper (he had apparently eaten nothing
since his release) and after a night's rest might wake up in a frame of
mind more in keeping with the day, which happened to be Christmas.
However, though still shaking blood out of his beak, his lust for battle
was unappeased and as evening fell he and the Yellow-mantle were at
it again as hard as ever. Next morning he renewed the combat and

The Marquess of Tavistock --" De Gustihus "
kept it up with unflagging zeal the whole day through. On the third
day he tried a skirmish with the Barnards, but his tactics lacked the
joyous zest of his previous encounters, and as the morning wore on it
was clear that he was not feeling quite happy. Although not normally
a tame bird he kept following me about and flying right up to me,
almost settling on my arm, while at intervals he went into the feeding
box and sat by the food dish, though he did not try to touch the
seed. It was not difficult to guess the nature of his trouble : his
lacerated tongue was by now so swollen and sore that he could not eat
a thing and he was getting desperately hungry. By one of those strange
uncanny flashes of abnormal intelligence that animals sometimes
show, he was convinced that I was able to help him. " Look here,"
his actions said as plain as words, " I'm in the devil of a fix ; I'm simply
starving and yet I can't get a scrap of food down. Can't you do any-
thing about it ? " I opened the door of his aviary--a low, awkward
door--and suggested that he should come inside, which he did almost
as quickly as an obedient dog. There he was easily caught and trans-
ferred to a cage, and provided with sop, finely chewed peanuts, crushed
apple, and grapes. But even with this assistance he had a very bad
time, and for some days I thought he would die. Grape juice was
almost the only thing he could get down and his breast bone grew as
sharp as a knife and he became too weak to fly. Even at his worst,
however, he could still whistle a challenge if he heard one of his late
rivals in the distance. Gradually, however, he began to mend, and
though it was quite five weeks before he could eat seed again, as soon
as this Arctic spell is over he will be fit to go back to the aviary. But
has he not an odd idea of pleasure ? With the whole world to fly about
in ; with no recognized mate or territory to defend ; with attractive
female society in the opposite direction, why must he impose his
presence on those few yards of space where two more powerful rivals
emphatically did not desire him and continue to impose it, even after
receiving an almost fatal wound, for twenty-four hours, until sheer
exhaustion compelled him to desist ?

By James B. Housden
(Concluded from p. 48)
The roads in Southern Texas are very good, but we often left them
to wander in the primeval forest. On either side of our track
stretched the forest- of marvellous beauty, a veritable fairyland and
paradise for birds. We often found along the tracks beautifully
marked tortoises and turtles, and on one occasion a Mocking-bird
fighting a Road-runner, both screaming and making a great noise.
Both birds had nests nearby. The Road-runner is a- bird the size of
a small Pheasant, and its nest contained eight beautiful large white eggs.
Some distance along the same track we found another nest with eggs,
which the hen bird was loth to leave. These birds were plentiful,
and could sometimes be seen teasing a rattlesnake. On our long trips
we got quite familiar with this shy, long-tailed bird and its swift but
odd loping wobble ; if while running he wants to stop quickly, he
sticks his long tail straight out.
As we journeyed through this evergreen forest of giant cotton-trees,
my companion suddenly pulled the car to one side : we had almost run
over a large snake. We returned the same way later in the day,
and found someone had killed this snake. I left the car to examine
it and found it to be the deadly Copper-head, about 5 feet in length;
already it was covered with flies and red ants.
Some distance away we again looked for the beautiful albino
Woodpecker, a most lovely white bird with a bright red head, which
seemed to be quite tame. We often found that while sitting in the
car birds took very little notice of us.
On another occasion many miles from home we visited the large
estate of a millionaire. I was introduced to the owner, who was
pleased to meet an Englishmen interested in birds ; and said that if
I could catch all his Woodpeckers he would be very pleased. He
had large tracts of the Pecon-trees. These birds, with various kinds
of squirrels, played havoc with the pecon nuts when ripe.
A river ran through this estate, and on the banks of this I found
again the Grey-tailed Cardinal. I was so anxious to find the nest that

James B. Housden--The Call of the Wild
I did not notice where I was walking, but trod in the middle of a heap
of leaves, which proved to be a nest of Moccasin snakes. The young
snakes darted away in all directions. We afterwards found the
Cardinal's nest, with four eggs.
On another occasion we visited another large estate far away in
the wilds of Texas. We rode along and found abundance of Hang-
nests, Blue-birds, Swamp, and other kinds of Song-Sparrows, Humming-
birds, and Road-runners, the latter quite tame. I found a number of
nests and eggs of the Seven-coloured bird (Nonpareil) and many kinds
of Warblers. It was a most beautiful spot, and looked as if no one
ever visited it. This was not the case, however, for when walking by
the side of a small lake and listening to the wild, plaintive call of the
Kill-deer Plover, we came to wheel tracks and a fire, which showed
clearly it was an illicit whisky still. It was certainly something we
were not looking for. I was sorry to leave this beautiful spot, but my
companion thought it wise to hurry back to our car, and not stay in
the neighbourhood.
We were travelling one day in a very rough part of the country
where we had to " blaze a new trail ". We left our car in the forest,
and went a long way on foot. A number of the cotton-tail and jack
rabbits were running about. We came to an open space near a pool
of water. Numbers of birds were here, and from a small shrub a very
small bird flew out and soared high above our heads. It was the hen
bird of one of the smaller kinds of Humming-birds, and had a nest of
young ones. It darted back and almost struck the cap of my com-
panion and then did the same to me, and continued to do so as long
as we remained near its nesting-place. It flew so quickly we could
hardly follow its movements, and certainly was a very courageous
little mother bird. One never tires of watching these smallest and most
exquisite birds. It is interesting to note that about twenty species of
Humming-birds pass through the United States east of the Mississippi
River, they may be seen as far westward as the Great Plains. Some
winter in Florida, but the majority pass to the West Indies, and through
Eastern Mexico into Central Mexico.
In the wilds of Texas Humming-birds invariably possess a charm
which he who has the nature soul appreciates to the full.

There were four gateposts in the front of the house next to the
road, the entrance to our plantation ; in the top of one of these a pair
of the Long-billed Wrens built a nest and hatched several young ones.
One night some small animal took the pair of Wrens and some of the
young, leaving four young ones which we put under a hen Canary
which had been sitting on unfertile eggs. She took to these young
birds and brought them up. In the top of the next post some large
wasps built a nest; and next to this another pair of Wrens built a nest
in an old tin I hung on the fence, and laid six eggs.
The largest State of U.S.A. is Texas, the Lone Star State, and some
of the most interesting birds met with are the Curve-bill Thrasher,
Western Meadow-lark, Texas Horned Lark, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher,
Green Jay, Florida Blue Jay, Carolina Wren, Golden-front Woodpecker,
White-rumped Shrike, Dwarf Cowbird, Texas Wren, Inca Dove,
Western and Mourning Dove.
Something amusing occurred soon after I arrived in Southern Texas.
A native boy brought to the house a fine specimen of the Horned Frog.
He had kept it, as far as I could understand, near an ants' nest, tied
with a piece of string to one of its hind legs. I told him I did not want
it. The poor boy looked so disappointed, and said, " He thort I'de like
to take it to U'rope." I rewarded him, and he promised to let it go.
Soon afterwards another boy arrived with two scorpions in a glass
bottle, and another boy brought some live crayfish. I could have had
Tarantula spiders, large butterflies, and other insects. A day or two
later another boy brought me a young Mexican Dove, saying it had
fallen out of its nest and he had found it under the tree. Another boy
with the same story. It was very interesting to examine these young
birds, and then I sent them back by the boys who brought them.
The secret was that I had a box of Texas Candies. The last boy
who came had climbed up a tall tree for a nest of the Baltimore Oriole
containing eggs. He took the nest and in his descent put the eggs in
his mouth and unfortunately broke them all. After this my box was
empty, and no more young birds or curious insects were brought.
All the time I was in Southern Texas I slept on the sleeping porch
in the open. A large Californian dog always slept on a mat near me
for protection. One night I was awakened by noises on the tin roof

over my head. I thought it was human footsteps, but found it was
a pair of 'coons (racoons) ; another night some skunks paid a visit,
but I always felt safe with my faithful watchdog.
I was always careful to examine my bed before retiring, to see that
it did not contain snakes or scorpions. I have found the latter in my
room, and another member of the family who did not take precautions
was severely bitten one night.
In Texas no one is allowed to keep native birds in cages. Some
time since the police made a raid on the Mexican quarter of the town,
and seized a number of birds, mostly Cardinals ; they took all the cages
to one of the parks, liberated the birds and destroyed the cages.
One day, near one of the lakes, I saw resting on a telegraph wire what
I took to be a long row of Humming-birds, though I knew these little
birds very seldom rested there ; on getting nearer I found they were
large, brilliant dragon-flies, looking exactly like Humming-birds.
Red Cardinals were very plentiful near our station, and a nurseryman
often captured them in a patent Sparrow trap set for the English
Sparrow, which is regarded as a pest and can be trapped all the year
round. When taken out the Red bird would cling to and bite the
fingers of the one who gave it its liberty before flying away.
One could write much more of our journeys in the wilds of Southern
Texas, with its beautiful country and interesting birds.
MR. S. HARVEY'S AVIARIES IN ADELAIDE
Mr. C. H. A. Lienau writes from Adelaide : "I am sending you
some snapshots I have taken of Mr. S. Harvey's new aviaries at
Kensington Gardens, Adelaide. He has recently moved to a new house
and has erected magnificent aviaries which are quite the best of those
privately owned in the Commonwealth.
" The bird resting on the frond of the tree-fern is a Royal Starling,
whose brilliant plumage contrasted well with the pale green of the
tree-fern.

Sir,-- Possibly these notes may be of interest for the Avicultural
Magazine. The manner in which our Ducks and Geese, forty-three
varieties, have come through this extraordinary hard winter, is perhaps
of interest to some readers. The ponds froze over on 28th December,
and are still frozen on this day, 26th February. On the 4th February
four days' thaw came, but soon went back to cold. Snow lay some
6 inches deep for eight days and, after a thaw, has returned and is slightly
deeper now. Ducks remained all day and night on the water and I have
kept small open spaces at the edge of which they have been fed.
Feeding consisted of wheat every day with a meal once a week of biscuit
and beef, green food, in the shape of thousand-headed kales given
ad lib., and also grit placed on the ice beside them. We are situated

some 200 feet above sea-level and 14 miles from Perth. There has not
been a single death amongst the foreign Ducks, but nearly all the
Pochard and Tufted died fairly soon, though Red-heads, Rosy-billed,
Red-crested, Canvas-back, and White-eyed Pochard seem none the
worse. There also have been no deaths among the surface feeders,
either British or foreign. The Mandarins evidently, from the way
they behave, feel the cold least of all the Duck, and the Upland feel
it least amongst the Geese. A Cereopsis had a toe frostbitten, and
even Greylag sat with legs drawn up on the coldest days, but Blue
Snow seemed like the Upland, fairly immune to cold. To give an idea
of the conditions, I should mention that of course all native Duck
and Geese left us long ago for tidal waters, and the Coots that remained
got so weak as to allow one to pick them up. In the garden, in an aviary
unheated and open on one side, Masked Lovebirds have nested through-
out the winter, bringing out a brood about the end of December, two
of which they reared safely and are now again sitting on eggs.
I think probably we are about as far north as anyone who keeps
the number of species we do, so have had about as bad a winter as it
is possible to have.

INHERITANCE OF COLOURS IN BUDGERIGARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997956615384615" page_id="56215798"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I think that someone ought to answer Mr. Bradshaw's
article in last month's Magazine. Many of your readers are more
interested in Foreign Birds than in Budgerigars and, as they have not
studied this subject of colour-breeding, they may be misled by what
Mr. Bradshaw says, and thus valuable opportunities of producing new
colours in other birds may be lost.
To begin with, Mr. Bradshaw attributes to the " Theorists " an
amount of obstinacy which they are far from possessing. I have yet to
meet the theorist who maintains that all about colour-breeding has
already been discovered. The Germans are, before all others, " The
Theorists," and as an example of their willingness to hear all sides of
the question let me tell Mr. Bradshaw the D.W.V. (which is the German
for B.C.) has asked Dr. Duncker to reprint his statistics and con-

elusions on colour-breeding and Mendelism, and that he has consented
to do so. He has written, however, to all members of the D.W.V. and
told them that he wishes to publish their results as well as his own
" whether they speak for or against my theory
Secondly, some of Mr. Bradshaw's statements are not correct.
For instance he writes that " theorists hold that the three factors
F.O.B. are able to account for everything that happens in breeding the
birds ". I should like to call his attention to what Dr. Duncker writes
in Vogel ferner Lander or to his remark on p. 6 of the Fifth B.C. Bulletin
" Very likely there is a fourth factor responsible for it." Moreover
I can send Mr. Bradshaw a letter written to me last month by Konsul
General Cremer in which he mentions a possible fifth factor, for which
he is now experimenting and to help which experiment I am sending
him a bird.
I am anxious that Mr. Bradshaw should not think that I doubt
his statements about the failure of the F's, O's and B's in his aviary.
I know of an excellent aviary not far from here where the breeder
produces whites in the most unexpected nests, just as a conjuror does
pigeons out of a top hat. Such exceptions are most interesting and
they show us that much still remains to be discovered and that we have
not reached, and I hope shall not for many years reach, the end of this
most fascinating hobby. But I am a theorist myself in a mild way,
and out of hundreds of coloured birds bred by me during the last two
or three years I can count the birds which have broken the theorists'
rules on one hand. I began colour-breeding in 1923 with a few common
olives and yellows, a pair of BB greens, four sky-blues and a husband
who had a little knowledge of Mendel's first figure. By sticking faith-
fully to Mendel at first, and later to the F's, O's and B's, I have developed
my own strains of cobalts, mauves and whites, while keeping my sky-
blues pure in colour. To show Mr. Bradshaw that he is wrong again
when he says that " he does not see how the breeder of Exhibition
Budgerigars can gain any material advantage from the application of
the theories " I may be forgiven for boasting that I won with my own
strains : First for mauves, First for cobalts, Third for whites and First
for sky-blues at the exhibition at the Crystal Palace last month.
(Mrs.) D. E. Wall.

INFLUENCE OF SOIL ON THE HEALTH OF BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9906883125" page_id="56215800"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The influence of soil on the health of the inmates of our aviaries
is a subject of considerable fascination, and one very little understood.
.For those obliged to forego the mobile aviaries advocated by the
Marquess of Tavistock, who are tied to fixed foundations, my own
experience may be of interest. My large aviaries for Parrots and Crow-
like birds, have rested for about twenty years on the same bed of
impervious clay. The greater part is exposed and nourishes a valiant, if
ragged, crop of course grass interspersed with anthills, the remainder
being of concrete. In these aviaries, which are decidedly on the large
side, and not over- populated, mortality has always been extremely low.
Cockatoos have bred during several years in rough barrels slung from
the roof under cover, and among other successful breeders have been
Ringnecks, Cockatiels and Abyssinian Lovebirds. Certainly all these
are hardy types, but there have been no cases of infertility or rickets.
I am now wondering if the impervious clay soil has contributed at
all to this immunity, and whether the malignant organisms, if present,
fail to effect a lodgment in the subsoil, and, owing to the considerable
slope of the ground, are merely washed away.
Pasteur, in his world-famous research on anthrax, about the year
1878, found that if an infected sheep was buried in a field to which a
flock of healthy sheep were introduced, these sheep remained sound for
a few years and then became infected. He came to the conclusion that
the organism reached the flock from the buried sheep and that the carrier
was. the earthworm, which alone could in time penetrate to the carcase.
Supposing that the earthworm might be a carrier of infection, I
have seen to it that they got short shrift, heavy doses of salt, alternately
with Carter's Worm Killer, doing the trick. It would be of interest if
aviculturists would supply data as to the nature of their soil, especially
in those districts where mortality is severe.
The evidence I have set out, in my own case, about clay and worms,
is of course quite negative, but might be worth while following up.

Sir, --The pair of Virginian Eagle Owls (Bubo virginianus) which
reared a young one last year have gone to nest and the hen has been
sitting for a fortnight.
Much to my surprise, the last year's bird has also laid and is
incubating her eggs (or egg ?) in the opposite corner to her mother.
Sheis only eleven months old, having been hatched last April.
She was left in the same compartment, as the old birds did not object,
and I thought her too young to pair up, in fact her sex was still a matter
of doubt.
The Verreaux's Eagle Owls (Bubo lacteus) made a scrape in their
inner compartment and went to nest. Unluckily the first egg came
during the severe frost, and nearly cost the hen her life. She had fived
eight years in the Zoological Gardens before coming into Mr. Lewis'
possession.
They are again preparing to nest and this time have chosen a heap
of rough dried grass and dead leaves for their nursery. They are ex-
ceedingly noisy, but not nearly as fierce as most Owls are at this time.
A pair of Ural Owls have just gone to nest in a barrel. The hen is
European, the cock Chinese. They also are particularly tame birds,
the cock has a habit of offering portions of rabbit or other food to his
human friends, as well as his wife. His heart sometimes fails him at
the last and makes him withdraw the offer, but his intention is excellent.

LOVEBIRD HYBRIDS AND THE MENDELIAN THEORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996830181818182" page_id="56215802"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I notice that you suggest experiments with hybrid Lovebirds
for research into the Mendelian theory. I write open to correction
but my impression is that Mendel's experiments were conducted with
colour or size varieties of the same species. Hybrids between different
species are not, as far as my own obsevation goes, usually at all subject
to the same laws. Either they breed true for an indefinite period, or,
as generation follows generation, there is a gradual dominance of the
characteristics of one of the original pure-bred parents over those of
the other, until all trace of the latter is finally lost. Golden X Amherst
Pheasant hybrids, mated inter se for some twenty generations, finally
produce birds nearly, or quite, indistinguishable from pure golden.
Tavistock.
[That is so : Mendel's experiments were conducted with varieties
of the same species and not with species crosses, but there is the question
as to whether two forms that have, comparatively recently, been
evolved from a common ancestor might not behave in the same way
as varieties and respond to Mendel's laws of Heredity. Pheasant crosses
certainly do not do so and, from what we have seen of Lovebird crosses,
these probably do not do so either; but with a view to proving this
definitely we would suggest that further experiments should be made
by mating birds of the first cross inter se as well as with one of the
parents.-- Editor.]

LONGEVITY

Sir, --On p. 84 of March number there is a query about the natural
life of small birds such as Waxbills. I take it that your correspondent
means longevity under conditions of captivity which preclude death
from natural enemies, shortage of food and water, and the perils
inherent to the wild state. Assuming this, I should consider that at
five years a Waxbill is quite old, and I find that this seems also a good
age for Budgerigars, whereas Canaries and Goldfinches will live up to
at least fourteen years with proper care and attention. The above is
the result of personal experience of birds both in large cages and in
outdoor aviary. Grey Waxbills at five years show every sign of old age

such as rough plumage, homy and stiff: feet and a gradual loss of energy
and strength. In fact, at this age in a wild state I should imagine they
could not exist for long under the stress of searching for food and water.
A batch of grey Waxbills in a large indoor flight cage were all in
perfect health for four years and then one by one they developed signs
of old age and died. No other cause than natural decay could be
attributed.
Years ago I had a Canary for fifteen years and a Goldfinch for
fourteen years, both ultimately dying from sheer old age.
I have never been able to keep Budgerigars to a greater age than
five years, and should be glad to hear other readers' experience, as
possibly the fact that my outdoor aviary is necessarily rather sunless
except in summer may be a contributing cause, although I have had
grey Waxbills and red-eared Waxbills in it for four years.

We have, in the past, become so accustomed to mild winters that
the recent spell of intense cold has served to remind us of what we
should be prepared for during the English winter. But it is remarkable
that many tropical birds have stood the test so well as they have.
Most of the Parrots, for instance, appear to be absolutely hardy ;
Macaws, Cockatoos. Lovebirds, and Budgerigars appear to be indifferent
to the temperature, but with many species there is a danger of frost-
bitten feet.
Wild birds have suffered badly during the recent cold, but the
reason for this has been the lack of food. Kedwings are the first to
die, and probably Fieldfares come next. I heard that these were
dying literally in hundreds on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall.

Tits have also suffered badly.
During the severest cold a Woodpigeon was sitting on eggs in a tree
in the London Zoo, but she was unable to prevent her eggs freezing.
A Cereopsis Goose hatched four eggs. Two of the goslings died at
once, but the remaining two, with their parents, were driven into a
shed, and have come through successfully.
No sooner had the weather improved than a pair of Crowned Lap-
wings made a nest of a few bits of grass, surrounded with
pebbles, within a foot or so of the wire of an aviary at the Zoo. The
hen laid two eggs and both birds take turns in incubating. They take
no notice of the visitors, but regard a keeper in uniform with suspicion,
knowing that he is the one creature who has access to their enclosure.
Word comes from Australia that the weather has been so hot that
aviculturists have been losing their birds from sunstroke, and even
wild birds and butterflies have been dying from the heat.

THE RED-CROWNED WART PIGEON

Amongst the Pigeons, the Alectroenas are certainly the most curious.
They constitute a small genus of Fruit Pigeons composed of five species
inhabiting the Islands of the Indian Ocean ; one inhabiting Madagascar
(A. madagascariensis) , another the Comoro Islands (A. sganzini), a third
Aldabra Island (A. minor). The fourth species (A. nitidissima) lived
in Mauritius, but is now extinct.
The fifth species, the Red-crowned Wart Pigeon (A. pulcherrima)
is an inhabitant of the Seychelles. This is a bird of the size of a
Barbary Dove but with a shorter tail. Its grey feet and short strong
legs suit it for a purely arboreal life.
The other species differ in form and the arrangement and intensity
of their colours. The species that formerly inhabited Mauritius
was the most beautiful, but only three specimens of this are known.
The species, of which a coloured plate appears herewith, feeds upon
various fruits and berries. It is protected in its own country and is
still to be found in fair numbers, but the rapid extension of rubber
culture is diminishing its native forest.
It appears that this species was formerly frequently imported,
but in recent years it has been very rare in Europe.

In the spring of 1914 I received at Villers-Britonneux four of these
Pigeons, three males and one female. They were in fairly good
condition in spite of the fatigue of the journey, during which they had
been badly fed. In time they recovered, and I exhibited two of them
at an exhibition in June, 1914. They recovered to such an extent
that at the end of July I found the cage upset and one of the males
violently fighting his companions. This seemed extraordinary, as
these Pigeons had appeared most peaceable up to then. I picked
up the two males and placed them in another cage, but the male
continued to chase the female while the other two continued to fight.
I was obliged to isolate each bird. Later I tried the female with each
bird in turn, but without success, and she would have been killed had
I left them together.
Later a male and female, kept in separate compartments, who had
shown great aversion to one another, suddenly became friendly, and
the female was seen to approach the male with pieces of hay in her
beak. I then had the idea of opening the intervening door, upon
which the birds approached one another and soon mated. Two days
later an egg was laid in a basket into which the Pigeons had carried
pieces of straw. This egg was somewhat elongated and misshapen
with a thin shell. The birds sat steadily, taking turns on the nest,
but the egg was found to be clear. On 15th June, 1917, the
Pigeon laid another egg in a basket fixed on a young tree close to the
side of the aviary, where the constant passing of visitors disturbed
the birds, and they abandoned the nest.
To prevent a similar accident occurring again, I placed the birds
in a much larger aviary planted with bushy trees, in which I fixed
baskets. During the first days of August an egg was laid in a very
small nest in the highest tree. I did not often look into the nest for
fear of disturbing the birds, but on 25th August I perceived that
it contained a young bird several days old, much like the young of any
ordinary Pigeon. I am unable to state the exact period of incubation,
but believe it to have been about twenty-eight days. The young one
grew rapidly and was completely fledged and left the nest on 12th
September, perching on a branch for the night with its parents. They
reared it on their ordinary diet of boiled potatoes, bruised hemp,

boiled rice, and banana. The young bird did not seem frightened
if approached. During the incubation period and the rearing of the
young the weather was very wet and cold, and a piece of matting
placed on the aviary above the nest kept it dry.
It has been stated that the species lays two eggs at a sitting, but,
although it is possible that it does so in the Segchelles, with me, on
three occasions, only one egg was laid. The first plumage of the young
is altogether different from that of the adult, and resembles that of
the young of many of the graminivorous Pigeons and is also somewhat
like them in form, with the exception of a shorter beak, larger and
stronger feet, and the general form more compact. The young bird
is illustrated in the plate. Unfortunately my Red-crowned Pigeons
were destroyed, with all my other birds, in the spring of 1918, and m&gt;
others have been imported since.

The long spell of intense cold from which we have suffered is likely
to have taught members of the Avicultural Society lessons, unpleasant
or otherwise, as to the power of foreign birds to withstand Arctic
conditions. My worst trouble, unforeseen and unguarded against
until too late, has been a bad outbreak of frost-bitten toes among
the Asiatic Parrakeets. Indian Bingnecks, Alexandrines, Malabars and
Layards have all suffered. In the worst cases the greater part of a toe
or toes has been affected, the birds adding to the damage by biting
their feet. A lutino-bred Ringneck, mother of the only lutino young one
I have ever produced, has lost so much of her toes that I fear she is
permanently spoiled for breeding, and my old lutino Alexandrine is
another bad case. Where the attack has been less severe sores have
appeared on the toes, and soon healed.
Unfortunately the birds' bodies were so much less sentitive to cold
than their feet that they never betrayed the mischief by looking
miserable at the time that it was being done.
It is rather strange that Palseornidse and Tanygnathi should have

108 Effect of the recent severe weather on Foreign Birds
come off so much worse than the rest. Fischer's Lovebirds were slightly
*affected, but an African Grey in the most exposed aviary of all was
perfectly happy, and her large fleshy feet received no damage at all.
'The Derbyan Parrakeets did not suffer in their feet like the other
members of their genus, but a cock, a rather weakly bird, was one of
the two deaths in the collection from chill.
The Amazons came through quite safely, and so did the Queen of
Bavaria Conures with the exception of one hen, an inveterate feather-
plucker, who has slight sores on her feet, having foolishly deprived
herself of every vestige of plumage in that part of her person against
which she might have warmed her toes.
None of the Australian Parrakeets suffered, neither did the Norfolk
Islands. Two Crimson-wings in a neighbour's rather small and exposed
aviary had to be taken in with foot trouble, but my old cock at liberty
and his family in aviaries received no harm. The Black Cockatoos
,( Calyptorhynchus ) were also unharmed by the frost.
Masked Lovebirds at liberty remained very cheerful. This species,
&amp;quot;by the way, seems a promising liberty bird. Unlike its relative, the
Black-cheeked Lovebird, it appears to be a good stayer and as it
always roosts in a log it is safe from Owls if the entrance holes to the
logs are not more than 1J inches in diameter. Enough logs must be
provided for young birds as well as old ones, and Starlings must be
shot if they try to usurp the nests. I have not found these Lovebirds
in any way destructive in the garden. Of the delicate birds with
heated shelters, the three Superb Tanagers came through with flying
*colours, though on the worst nights the shelter temperatures must have
been well below 50* Fahrenheit. Clearly this genus is not so sensitive to
*cold as many believe. If they can be provided with a snug shelter with
*a living-room temperature, a big flight and correct feeding, they will
do better out of doors than many Waxbills that are commonly described
as hardy.
The Purple Sunbirds have done equally well under the same
conditions.
The cock Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot died the first really cold
night, although his shelter was one of the cosiest of all. His mate
has survived. The hen Golden-backed Hanging Parrot unfortunately

T. H. Newman--The Bronze-winged Doves and Pigeons 109
died of kidney disease during a mild spell before the severe weather
began. The cock came through in the best of condition, and was
often in the flight on very bitter days.
The little Beautiful Lorikeet has also taken no harm, rather to my
surprise. It is amazing the contrast between what some birds will
stand when they have been carefully acclimatized and what they
need when first imported. Hypocharmosyna placens is intensely fragile
on first arrival and must be coddled at an even temperature of 85*
Fahrenheit for many weeks, even when it is plump and in good feather.
A cock Yellow-bellied Parrakeet which spent part of the winter of
1927-8 at liberty ceased to return for food early in November, and for
nearly four months was not seen at all, although an occasional rumour
indicated that he might be still in the county ! At the end of February
he was seen about half a mile away. A fortnight later I had one distant
glimpse of him flying off from the outskirts of the garden. Now he is
back almost daily as the warmer weather brings a reawakened interest
in his wife and in domestic affairs. It is strange to think that when
frost and snow were killing our native birds an Australasian was
not even hungry enough to come back where he knew that food
awaited him !

The sub-family containing the true Bronze-winged Doves and
Pigeons formerly known as the Phabince must now, most unfortunately,,
be called the Turturinw , as the real genus Turtur is the oldest name in
this group. They are mostly somewhat stoutly built birds with metallic
spots or patches on the wings ; they spend much time on the ground,
indeed some of the genera are the most terrestrial birds of the whole
order. They can be fed on millet, dari and a little hemp, while wheat
and maize can be added for the larger species. Earthworms with
smooth caterpillar and other insects are freely eaten by some of the
larger Bronze-wings. They are confined to the Old World.

Masked or Namaqua Dove (CEna capensis). This graceful little Dove

110 T. H. Newman--The Bronze-winged Doves and Pigeons
is common in wooded steppes, in gardens round farms and cattle
kraals, running rapidly on the ground in search of the grains and seeds
on which it feeds. It has a long slender tail and when hovering looks
like a beautiful foreign butterfly, but when alarmed its flight is swift
and arrow-like. In captivity it often loses its natural sprightliness,
spending its time motionless perched on some twig or other perch,
becoming dull and over-fed. It has been frequently bred, and the young
are easy to rear if they can be prevented from jumping out of the nest
at a too early age. The eggs are creamy-buff. Male : Upper parts
brownish-grey, more ashy on crown, neck and wing-coverts, the latter
with large steel-blue patches, quills cinnamon, lower back brownish
buff bordered with two black bands, front part of head and entire
throat black, breast and abdomen white ; bill red at base with yellow
tip. Female has no black on head and throat and is duller. Habitat :
Africa from Senegal and the Egyptian Sudan south to the Cape, also
Socotra and Arabia, Red Sea coast and Aden. The bird from
Madagascar differs slightly.
The Tambourine Hove (Tympanistria tympanistria) is a very
charming species. In South Africa it inhabits wooded districts near the
coast and feeds on fallen seeds, being especially fond of those of the
castor oil plant, it also eats insects and small slugs and snails ; its
flight is rapid. It does not seem to have ever been very freely imported
to this country. I have seen a good many in France. It was first
bred by the late Dr. A. G-. Butler and an interesting account appeared
in The Avicultural Magazine, IV, 2, p. 307. A pair of the young
came into my possession, but I did not keep them very long. In
captivity they seem to lose much of their natural activity, spending
much time motionless on a branch. The eggs are creamy-white, and,
like other African Bronze-wings, it is very peaceful and will live with
other allied species in perfect amity. It derives its name from its
remarkable notes, which sound rather like a tom-tom, beginning slowly
" Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo " and ending in a rattling
" gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r The male has the upper surface brownish-grey ;

T. H. Neivman--The Bronze-winged Doves and Pigeons 111
The female has the white parts more greyish and the wing-spots without
the metallic shading. Habitat: Africa, South of the Zambesi. A
darker race (fraseri) is found from Sierra Leone, Lake Chad and
Abyssinia south to the Zambesi, also in the Comoro Island and
Madagascar.
The Sapphire-spotted Dove (Turtur afer). I have ventured to give
this species a new vernacular name instead of the more usual Blue-
or Purple-spotted one as the very closely related species with green spots
has long been known as the Emerald-spotted Dove. It was to this
African species that the generic name Turtur was first given by Boddaert
in 1783, so that it is the original Turtle-dove, although by no means
closely allied to the birds known by that name at the present time.
The Sapphire-spotted Dove resembles the Tambourine in habits, but
frequents more open ground such as broken bush and clearings near
rivers and obtains its food, consisting chiefly of grass seeds, on the
ground. Its note sounds like " Tor, tor-tor, tor-tor-tor, tor-tor-tor-tor-
tor-tor-tor ", in a gradually halting scale. They nest in bushes or low
trees. Upper surface earthy-brown, two black belts across the lower
back ; upper tail-coverts tipped with black, inner median coverts and
some of the scapula ornamented with bold sapphire-blue spots ; crown
leaden-grey, white on forehead ; neck and breast vinous, fading to
bufflsh-white on abdomen ; bill dusky, with broad orange tip. Female
slightly smaller and a trifle paler. Habitat: From Gambia to
Portuguese Guinea. The species and races of the genus Turtur have
only lately been differentiated, so that it is impossible to state which
forms have been so far imported. A darker race of afer known as
Kilimensis 1 comes from Sierra Leone to Angola and East to Uganda,
Kenya, Nyasaland, South Bhodesia and the Zambesi valley, while
a paler form mearnsi inhabits Abyssinia and Shoa highlands.
The Black-billed Sapphire-spotted Dove (T. ahhyssinicus) is
very like afer , differing chiefly by having the bill black ; it has the same
blue spots on the wings. Habitat: Abyssinia and Erithea, with a
possibly distinct race from the Sudan west to Lake Chad and the Gold
Coast Colony.

112 T. H. Newman--The Bronze-ivinged Doves and Pigeons
The Emerald-spotted Dove (T. chalcospilos) . Mr. Paget-Wilkes
in The Ibis, p. 732, 1928, writing on the Birds south of Lake Nyasa
says : " Resident and breeding. This species is local, but abundant
where it does occur . . . They seem to frequent a dry low-level
type of country . . . The breeding period seems to be during the
winter and slightly earlier than the Streptopeliince, although I once
found eggs in late September. They are cream-coloured ovals, and the
nest more substantial than one would be led to expect; it is rarely
placed at any great height from the ground, the highest found being
about ten feet up in a bamboo thicket." The note, according to
Dr. A. G. Butler, sounds like " Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo,
hoo, hoo, hoo ", very like that of the Maiden Dove. It has been bred
in the London Zoological Gardens. Differs from afer by its smaller
size, greyer upper surface and vinous colour of underparts, deeper and
more extended on abdomen and the metallic spots on the wings deep
emerald-green to golden-green ; the bill is dull black. Habitat: South
and East Africa from Abyssinia and Somaliland to the Cape Province,
also Angola and Belgian Congo. A darker race volkmanni from the
South-West African Protectorate, east to Lake Ngami.
The Australian Green-winged Dove (Chalcophaps chrysochiora)
is an inhabitant of the bush, being never seen in the open parts of the
country; its habits are terrestrial, feeding on fallen seeds and fruits.
When flushed it flies quickly through the scrub to no great distance,
readily eluding pursuit by pitching suddenly to the ground and
remaining so quiet that it can rarely be discovered. It has been freely
but irregularly imported ; it was first bred by Mr. Seth-Smith in 1906.
Dr. Butler kindly gave me a hen bird which I kept with a cock of the
India species, but they did not nest, I am not sure that they even mated.
The cock bird has the head, neck, and under parts rich vinous with a
chocolate tone, a purplish tint on back of head and hind neck ; back
and wings emerald green with a white band on the bend of the latter ;
lower back dark with two grey bands ; tail grey with black band at
tip ; bill bright red. The hen is slightly duller than the cock, the patch
on bend of wing is greyish, the purplish tint on hind neck is almost
absent and the tail is chestnut brown with black subterminal band.
The typical bird is found in South Queensland, New South Wales and

T. H. Newman---The Bronze-zuinged Doves and Pigeons 118
Victoria, a form with slightly longer bill (longirostris) from Northern
Territory, a third Australian form ( rogersi ), paler with the colour on
the nape less pronounced from North Queensland. It is to this form
that the bird figured in The Avicultural Magazine, V, 3, p. 149,
belongs. Other races from Timor, New Caledonia and New Hebrides.
The Indian Green-winged Dove (C. indica). This charming little
Dove is common in damp evergreen forests, also in deciduous forest
and bamboo-jungle, and is partial to the banks of the smaller forest-
streams ; they are very active on the ground, feeding on vegetable
matter, but are very fond of white ants and will eat worms, also soft
fruits. The nest, better put together than most species, is placed in
high bushes or small saplings from five to ten feet from the ground,
the eggs being pale cream to a fawn shade. The late Miss Alderson
describes how she bred the species in The Avicultural Magazine,
V, 3, p. 151. Differs chiefly from the Australian species by having
the forehead and eyebrow-streak white, shading into bluish-leaden
on crown and nape, no conspicuous white band on bend of wing.
Habitat: India to Celebes and some Papuan Islands and New Guinea.
The bird from Ceylon has lately been called robinsoni from its smaller
size and well-marked blue-grey streak down the back of the neck.
The Christmas Island Green-winged Dove (C. i. natalis) is
another sub-species of the Indian bird; the cock scarcely differs from
the typical form, but the hen bird has the neck, upper back and breast
rufous-chestnut, upper tail-coverts and central tail feathers pure
cinnamon. A single female specimen reached the Gardens at Regent's
Park in 1903. She laid eggs when mated I think with an Indian bird.
Dr. Andrews tells us that it is by far the most brightly coloured bird on
Christmas Island, usually seen in pairs, but sometimes in small flocks
near water. The food consists of small fruits and the nests are placed
in thickets of screw-pine. The green and chestnut plumage matching
very closely with the leaves and soil make the bird very difficult to see.
Stephani's Green-winged Dove (C. stephani). We read in the
Jubilee Supplement of The Ibis on " The Birds of Dutch New Guinea ",
p. 310, that " This dainty little Dove spends all its time on the ground,
only perching in the trees when alarmed. It is by no means uncommon,
but being a ground-bird and living among the denser undergrowth.

114 T. H. Neivman--The Bronze-iuinged Doves and Pigeons
it is more often to be heard getting on the wing than seen. Four
specimens were purchased by the London Zoological Society in August,
1921, and Mr. Ezra has it in his beautiful aviaries at Foxwarren Park.
Differs very markedly from the other two species of Green-winged
Doves by having the middle of back and scapulars cinnamon-rufous
with only the median and greater wing-coverts and outer webs of tertials
metallic green ; the forehead of the male is pure white (dark grey in the
female) abruptly defined from the colour of the crown ; tail rufous-
brown. Habitat: , Celebes, New Guinea and islands of Bismarck
Archipelago. The bird from the Solomon Islands has been called
mortoni, said to be larger with more extended white forehead.
The Maiden Dove (Calopelia puella). In the Gold Coast Colony
this beautiful little Dove is rare, keeping chiefly to the thickest part
of the forest. At Sierra Leone it is altogether a forest-bird, never seen
in the open. It is fond of hunting about on the ground among the
dead leaves. Its song is very like that of Turtur but louder, and
Dr. Butler was doubtless quite right in placing it next to that genus. He
has given us some very interesting notes in The Avicultural Magazine,
IV, 2, p. 251, with a coloured plate. It is a pity that this very
charming and desirable species seems to be very delicate in captivity,
but it is probably a question of acclimatization, and is one of the species
which cannot stand the damp cold of our winters, so should be given
heat during the cold season. General colour cinnamon ; head and neck
cobalt-blue, forehead and throat bluish-white, lores black, inner greater
wing-coverts and secondaries spotted with golden-green, the tail, which
is much rounded, has the three outer pairs banded with grey and black.
Female smaller but stouter, chin sordid white, throat tinged with
cinnamon, not blue ; the young have the feathers of the wings barred
wdth black. Habitat: West Africa from Sierra Leone and the Gold
Coast to the Cameroon Mountains. There is a supposed different race
with the wing spots metallic lake-red with a slight copper tint from
Cameroon to Gaboon and Loango, east to Peko and the Vele Eiver,
known as brehmeri. Dr. Butler thought that most of the imported
birds belonged to this form, but both are said to have been found
at Efulen in Cameroon, probably the district where the two races meet.

alhifrons). Mr. Claud Grant found this extraordinary bird tolerably
common in Dutch New Guinea, but very wary. It is distinctly a ground
haunting species, though it often perches in the large trees. Males
were showing off to the females after the manner of the Wood Pigeon.
On being disturbed, they fly for a considerable distance, the flight being
swift and straight considering the density and close proximity of the
trees. Probably largely a fruit-eater. Two examples were purchased
by and a third deposited at the London Zoological Gardens in November,
1921, sent over by the Australian Zoological Control Board ; as far as
I know these are the only specimens ever imported alive. General
colour slaty-grey, mantle and scapulars black with a green lustre,
median and inner greater wing-coverts golden-bronze, edged with dark
chestnut; forehead white; a very long slaty-horn coloured bill.
Habitat: New Guinea and Western Papuan Islands.
The Bronze-winged Pigeon (Phaps chaleoptera) . This fine bird
is widely distributed in Australia. At Broome Hill, South-West
Australia, it is common and feeds on the seeds of the acacia known
.as Jam Trees. It is also fond of the seeds of the Saffron-thistle. They
often sit very closely on the ground, relying on their protective colouring
to escape observation. Their first flight, after being disturbed, is usually
a short but rapid one, to the limb of a neighbouring tree. They drink
mostly about sundown, continuing to arrive until it is quite dark.
The nest is placed on horizontal branches near the ground, often in
hollow spouts of trees. In captivity they are very hardy, good tempered,
.and breed freely ; their large size and beautiful colouration make them
most attractive. The male has the forehead and front part of head
ochreous buff, crown greyish-brown, purplish on sides, a whitish line
below the eye extending across the ear-coverts ; back of neck and upper
.surface grey-brown with lighter edges to feathers, outer wing-coverts
with large patches of fiery-copper or metallic emerald-green according
to light, inner secondaries with large patches of shining violet, changing
to greenish Prussian-blue, cheeks and sides of neck bluish-ashy ; throat
white, breast vinous, changing to grey on abdomen. The female lacks
the buff forehead, the breast is greyish-brown without the vinous tint.
The typical race inhabits South Queensland, New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A smaller and paler form

116 T. H. Newman--The Bronze-winged Doves and Pigeons
is found in Northern Australia, while the birds from South and Mid
West Australia are said to be more sandy coloured above with more
pink below. A coloured plate of this species appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine for January. 1929.
The Brush Bronze-winged Pigeon [P. (Cosmopelia) elegans ] is
more sturdily built than the last species; it is found in low damp
scrubby country, spending most of its time on the ground, where it
feeds on seeds and berries. The nest is placed in a thick bush, on a
fallen tree, or even on the ground. The Brush Bronze-wing is one of
the prettiest members of the family, and the display of the male to the
female is very effective as he raises and spreads his tail and beautiful
metallic banded wings and bows up and down. It was first bred
by Mr. Seth-Smith in 1904, and a full and interesting account appeared
in The Avigultural Magazine, III, 2, pp. 211 and 263. The male
above is olivaceous-grey, the hind neck and upper back washed with
chestnut; two broad fiery copper-green and purple metallic bands
across the wings ; forehead ochre-yellow, crown grey ; a chestnut band
runs from the corner of the eye to the nape, under surface grey. Female
duller than male and generally without the ochre forehead. The typical
race comes from Tasmania. The mainland bird known as neglecta is
slightly larger and paler. In 1912 I reared some very handsome hybrids
from a male Brush mated with a female common Bronze-wing. They
were very beautiful birds, looking like a distinct species favouring
mostly their mother. I think they might have bred, as they showed
signs of wanting to nest, but the war prevented my continuing the
experiment.
The Harlequin Bronze-winged Pigeon (Histriophaps histrionica)
is known as the Flock Pigeon in Australia on account of its sudden
appearance in flocks when grass seeds are plentiful. It inhabits the
open plains of the interior, nesting on the bare ground under a low bush.
They fly long distances to water and have been seen to alight all over
the surface, take a hasty drink and then fly away. According to
Mr. Berney in Memoirs of the Queensland Museum , vol. ix, June, 1928,
this is a disappearing species. I have never seen the bird alive, as it is
rarely imported, it was bred in the London Gardens in 1866 and in
France in 1881. Male upper surface cinnamon-brown, edge of wings and

primaries grey, the latter tipped with white, outer secondaries with a
patch of metallic purple and green on outer webs. Tail of fourteen
feathers (sixteen in Phaps), two central ones like the back, rest grey with
blackish subterminal band and tipped with white, crown, sides of face,
ear-coverts and throat jet-black ; forehead, a line encircling the ear-
coverts and patch on lower throat pure white, under surface grey,
washed with cinnamon on flanks and under tail-coverts. Female has
not got the black and white markings on the head. Habitat: Interior
of New South Wales and Queensland, a slightly paler race ( alisteri )
in North-West Australia and Northern Territory.
The White-quilled Kock Pigeon (Petrophassa albipennis
inhabits the broken sandstone ranges at the mouth of the Victoria
Fiver, being restricted to the sandstone region. They are hard to flush,
but rise with a loud whirr, fly for a short distance and usually alight
on bare rocks, run a few yards, and crouch down near a rock with
which their colour harmonizes so well that they are difficult to detect.
They nest in slight hollows lined with soft dead grass, on the ground,
near a small tuft of spinifex, or stone. A single specimen was deposited
in the London Zoological Gardens in February, 1910. General colour
rufous-brown, the feathers with lighter edges, lores black, head and
neck greyer, feathers of chin and throat tipped with white ; some of the
inner wing-coverts and one of the inner secondaries have a metallic
coppery-violet spot; basal half of primaries pure white ; feet dark
brown; sexes alike. Habitat: Adjoining parts of North-West
Australia and Northern Territory. A darker form ( alisteri ) inhabits
West North-We&amp;t Australia. A very nearly allied species with chestnut
quills ( rufipennis ) lives in Northern Territory.
The Partridge Bronze-winged Pigeon ( Geophaps scripta ) is
called the Squatter Pigeon in Australia and is purely a terrestrial
species with the habits of a Partridge or Quail. It is of a very peaceful
and gentle disposition. It moves about in small flocks and, when dis-
turbed, the individuals scatter and endeavour to hide by squatting
down near any object such as a stone, and are then difficult to see or
flush. They always nest on the ground, sometimes sheltered by herbage.
This is a most desirable species in captivity, being gentle and of very
interesting habits, but very few seem to have been brought over alive.

118 T. H. Newman -- The Bronze-iuinged Doves and Pigeons
I obtained a pair in 1907 and in 1908 reared two young ones and four
more the following year ; a full account was printed in The Avicultural
Magazine for October and November, 1908. The chief points of
interest seem to be that the young when hatched are not more downy
than many other species of Pigeons though they leave the nest at an
early age, that there is a well developed egg-tooth on the lower mandible
as well as on the upper which is retained until it becomes worn away,
and that the young begin to moult before the first plumage is complete,
so that by the time the bird reaches its full size it has attained its adult
plumage. General colour pale brown with paler tips to the upper
wing-coverts, greater coverts with a patch of shining purple shading
into green, obscured by dusky bars a narrow strip above and in fiont
of eye, cheeks, throat and a band each side of breast white ; two black
bands across the sides of the head which run into another which borders
the white cheeks ; abdomen grey. Sexes alike, but the female smaller.
Habitat: South Queensland and New South Wales, a larger and darker
race ( bourJcei ) from Western New South Wales, and a smaller and lighter
coloured bird ( peninsulce ) from North Queensland.
Smith's Partridge Pigeon (G . smithii) is founds in flocks of from
six to twenty birds, in forest country ; when flushed they fly into the
nearest tree, choosing the largest part of a horizontal branch to perch
on, rest a few seconds, then dash out of sight, but they often allow them-
selves to be nearly trodden upon before rising. The cream-coloured
eggs are laid on the ground in a shallow grass-lined depression ; acacia
and grass seeds are the chief articles of food. Like the last species it is
seldom imported; a pair that I had were very nice quiet birds. Very
like scripta but smaller and more uniform brown, a large bare rosy-red
space round the eye surrounded by a black line, on the centre of the
breast a patch of clear grey, the feathers edged at the tip with black,
giving a barred appearance. Habitat: Northern Territory, the bird
from North-West Australia has been called blaaowi on account of its
lighter coloured upper surface and yellow naked eye-space.
The Plumed Ground Dove (Lophophaps plumifera) is abundant
on the Victoria River, Northern Territory, among rocks and hot sandy
gullies and is fond of perching on a rock in the full glare of the sun ;
they feed on spinifex seeds and place their eggs on the ground often

under a spinifex tussock. It is said to have been exhibited at Amsterdam,
Berlin and Cologne, as well as in the London Gardens, but it is rather
doubtful whether they were not really belonging to the White-bellied
form next dealt with, which is certainly the bird commonly imported.
General colour pale cinnamon, the neck, mantle and wing-coverts
barred with brown, the latter and the scapulars grey at base ; some of
the inner secondaries glossed with bronzy-purple on their outer webs,
forehead and ear-coverts grey ; centre of crown with long crest feathers
cinnamon ; cheeks and throat white ; chin, a line over eye and gorget
black ; a greyish-white band across the chest, centre of abdomen white ;
bare skin round the eyes crimson. Female similar but smaller.
Habitat: Northern Territory and Queensland.
The White-bellied Plumed Ground Dove (L. p. leucogaster)
is only a race of plumifera which it represents in the great interior of
Australia. They love rocky country and are strictly ground birds,
assembling on the rocky sides of gorges and enjoy basking in the sun ;
their colours harmonizing well with the red sand and rocks, they lay on
the ground generally near a tussock of porcupine grass. This bird was
imported quite freely some years before the war; though I had three or
four pairs I never got beyond a few eggs, as they are very quarrelsome ;
Not more than a pair should be kept together. An account with coloured
plate appeared in The Avicultural Magazine, V, 2, p. 51, by
Mr. Seth-Smith. Differs from the typical form by being paler with a
distinct whitish band above the grey pectoral band and larger amount
of white on the centre of the breast. I noticed that some of my birds
had the metallic spots on the secondaries very green, while in others
they were purple. Habitat: Central Australia. A third race (pallida)
from North-West Australia is paler above than plumifera.
The Bed Plumed Ground Dove (L. ferruginea), which only differs
by its darker colour and absence of white on abdomen and breast-
band, does not seem to have been imported. Habitat: Mid and
North-West Australia.
The Crested Bronze-winged Pigeon ( Ocyphaps lophotes) is
always found near water, congregating in flocks in the morning and
evening when they drink and scattering through the forests and scrub
during the day. They build their slight, flat nests in low bushes and

trees, sometimes on a stump. This very handsome but generally
pugnacious species has been very freely imported and frequently
bred. I have had five or six specimens, one pair reared a young one;
an odd cock which could not fly very well was so tame that it always
came and cooed to me whenever I went into the aviary. But it is at
liberty that this bird is at its best; it has a most rapid dashing flight
accompanied by a whistling sound doubtless due to the strongly
attentuated third primary. On alighting the long tail is jerked
upwards. Many were turned out both at Woburn Abbey and in Regent's
Park and I think also in France. Wings and back sandy grey, the former
with a black subterminal band giving a barred appearance ; greater
wing-coverts metallic green with white borders ; secondaries metallic
violet shading into blue with broad white edges ; head, neck and
under-surface grey, long feathers of crest black. Female similar,
perhaps a little smaller. Habitat: South Queensland, New South
Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The bird from Mid and North-
West Australia is smaller and has been called whitlocki, and that
from Northern Territory, North Queensland and Central Australia is
paler and has been distinguished by the name stalkeri.

By Miss K. Colville
I wonder if your readers would care to hear some of the experiences
of a complete novice in aviculture.
I started a small aviary of mixed Parrakeets last summer, in my
garden. Before that I had only had a Blue-fronted Amazon Parrot,
" Fergus," and " Robert ", a blue and red Macaw, both very tame,
and spending most of their days up fruit-trees in the garden. Fergus
can talk well, and loves to be on my shoulder when I am walking or
bicycling. Robert can only say a word or two, and is too heavy to
carry for long on one's wrist.
Fergus has flown away three or four times in the seven years that
I have had him ; but generally circles round the village, alighting on
the highest tree he can find, and refuses to come down till he is hungry

enough, calling out derisively at intervals " Hullo ! " and " Nice boy,
Fergus! "
One March he was away for a week, entirely out of sight or hearing.
As I had searched the entire neighbourhood for him in vain, and there
were high cold winds with sleet, I had given him up in despair ; but
he returned to a neighbouring tree, after six days' absence, none the
worse for his adventure.
The aviary shelter is 7 feet square and 6 feet high, and the flight
is about 8 feet square, and the inmates are pairs of Ringnecks, Rosellas,
Redrumps, Cockatiels, and Yellow Budgerigars.
Only the Budgerigars nested last summer, but the Cockatiels are
sitting now, and have six eggs, and the Ringneck hen has begun to
sit, and of course the Budgerigars are hard at it.
They have all survived this extremely cold winter, on the top of
the Cotswolds, with only a small-sized petrol heater in the hardest
frosts. I shut them up each evening at sunset, ringing a small bell
which they have now learned to obey as a signal.
When the Ringnecks arrived last June they could not fly at all,
though thoroughly mature birds, and I had to fix branches as staircases
to enable them to climb in and out of the shelter. Now they fly well
and are in beautiful plumage, but are very timid birds.
I also have a pair of Blue Budgerigars in a large flight cage, and
hope to have another small aviary this summer for them, and a new
pair of Parrakeets which I have just got from Rogers, of Liverpool.
These birds are very tame, but noisy, and are some kind of Conures,
but Mr. Rogers does not know exactly what kind, whether " Sun ",
" Jendaya ", or " Carolina ".
From the description given of Conures in Lord Tavistock's book,
I think they are Sun Conures ; but Mr. Rogers thinks they are a new
variety of the Jendaya.
I will describe them as well as I can, and perhaps you would be able
to tell me their exact species.
Cock : Head and body of a deep gold and orange, becoming redder
on the lower breast; strong orange-red round eyes ; tail green tipped
with blue ; wings green with blue on edges ; bill dark horn, practically
black ; head rather large and round.

Hen : Smaller, with some green running up into the back of her
head, and less red in the orange colouring. 1
The Macaw, " Robert," whom we have had fifteen years, and always
believed to be a cock, suddenly laid an egg last Spring. For a month
or two afterwards he (or rather she) seemed depressed and bedraggled ;
but later on regained his usual health and spirits and splendid
plumage. I suppose now we ought to change his name to " Colonel
Barker " !

Members will wish to send hearty congratulations to Mr. Kell,
an enthusiastic aviculturist in South Australia, on his success in breeding
the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet. Two young birds have been reared,
and Mr. Kell tells us that during the time the old birds were sitting
and rearing the young no special food was given, their diet being
canary and sunflower seed and lettuce. One youngster left the nest
three days after the other, both being strong birds. The species was
first bred in England by the late Mr. Hubert Astley in 1912.
The Alexandra Parrakeet is certainly one of the most lovely of all
the Parrot tribe, beautiful both in shape and the delicacy of its colours
and rare as it is beautiful. Its home is in the dry country of Central
Australia, but its movements appear to be somewhat irregular, for
one year it will appear in some numbers in a locality in which it has
not been seen for many a day, remaining for a season and then
departing, to be seen no more for several seasons.
When I visited Western Australia some twenty years ago, I travelled
inland as far as Kalgoorlie to see the gold mines and kept an eye open
for any interesting birds. I was told that the year before the Alexandra
Parrakeet had been comparatively common there, but all I could find
was one in a cage that had been reared from the nest. I purchased
P Apparently Aratinga solstitialis , the Sun Conure. The Carolina Conure is
extinct.--E d.]

it after some trouble and brought it home. It was a charming bird,
perfectly tame and able to articulate several words and even short
sentences.
This species was named by John Gould after the late Queen, then
Princess Alexandra, and he referred it to the genus Polytelis , where
it would seem to have every right to belong, but Mr. North discovered
that one feather on each wing in the adult cock was spatulate, and
so he created for it the genus Spathojpterus, but now Mr. Gregory
Mathews has gone fuither and created yet another genus for it, and
so its present name is Northipsitta alexandrce.
Mr. Sydney Porter has gone to the West Indies, where he has seen
something of the rare Island species of Amazon Parrots. He writes
from Dominica : " I have been right up into the dense virgin forests
on the volcano and seen the birds nesting. There are a few left, but
they are far from plentiful. I have obtained one Imperial from a
native, but it was badly wounded, and I am afraid it will not live.
I have two good examples of bouquetti. both cocks, and lost a fine hen.
These are very rare, too, but I have also been to theii breeding haunts.
I am hoping to visit St. Vincent if I have time." We shall look forward
to a very interesting account of Mr. Porter's experiences when he
returns.
During 1928 Madame Lecallier had great success in breeding
foreign birds in her new aviaries at Saint-Pierre-les-Elbeuf. Amongst
Pheasants, 15 Elliots, 2 Siamese Eirebacks, and many Golden and
Common. Chinese Bamboo Partridges reared 2 broods of two and
four, while of Formosan Bamboo Partridges two young were reared
under a hen, the first to be reared in Europe. Of Parrakeets, 6 Barra-
band, 6 Stanleys, 3 Barnards, 4 Mealy Kosellas, 2 Blue-wings, and 6
Many-colours were reared, 2 broods of the latter species being reared
by the same pair of birds, which is unusual.
But it was with Doves and Pigeons that Mme Lecallier was most
successful, rearing numbers of Crested, Diamond, and Masked, 6

Sir, --I think Mr. Allen is quite right in regarding the earthworm
as an active agent in spreading disease, no doubt by reason of its habit
of constantly filling itself with soil and anything that the soil may
contain. The dangerous nature of the worm under certain conditions
is indicated by the fact that it is often impossible to rear young Cranes
(which are fed by the parents largely on earthworms) in any enclosure
where the ground is in the least degree fouled by a large stock of birds.
Salt is a good and safe worm destroyer and soil purifier, but I am
surprised that the use of a worm-killer preparation did not result
in the poisoning of the birds.

Sir,--In regard to the question of the age attainable by birds of
different species, I must say I have not the slightest belief in the common
theory that the wear and tear of wild life--the search for food, weather
exposure, etc.--tend to shorten a bird's life. Of course birds may be

starved by abnormal cold or abnormal drought, but in the main I am
sure that the exercise involved in the normal search for food operates
powerfully as a life-lengthener by keeping the bird in that hard con-
dition which in all animals is so conducive to longevity.
If its constitution is not too weakened to withstand the increased
exposure to changes of temperature, the rejuvenating effect of complete
liberty on a bird ageing rapidly in close confinement must be seen in
order to be believed.
Judging by the birds I have observed I am inclined to think that
confinement in an English house would involve many factors tending
to shorten a Waxbill's life--lack of sun and exercise, shortage of green
and insect food, etc.--and that no Waxbill so kept would attain any-
thing like the maximum number of years of which its species is capable
under the most favourable conditions. I have seen a Budgerigar
that had lived thirteen years in a cage and looked old. I cannot
help feeling that under the best possible conditions the species ought
to be capable of seeing its twenty-first birthday, at least, but I am
aware that under ordinary conditions few may survive much more
than half that period. In the course of about 22 years' aviculture
I have never seen any larger Parrot-like bird, whose age I knew, grow
old in my collection and only three or four, all senile when they came
to me, have died wholly or mainly from old age. A record has just
come to my notice of a cock Budgerigar vigorous and breeding after
eleven years, and another of a cock Pennant which lived for thirty-
two years in captivity. Tavistock.

of mine about my Rook " Jinnie " ; after fourteen years spent in the
Rectory she died during May, 1926.
I want now to tell you about another Rook, our dear little Michael,
whom we have lately lost.
His short life was contained in nine months. Miss Latcham,
Jinnie's foster-mother, took him in, a poor half-drowned, half-starved
little mite fallen out of the nest last May ; he was killed at the end of
February this year.

I think his was one of the happiest lives I have ever known ; he
lived out of doors, mingling with the other Kooks and birds, full of
life and energy. He used to go walks with me, and came in and out
of the house as he liked, always returning at night and requiring plenty
of attention from his foster-mother before he went to sleep. His
affection for her was very moving.
I could fill pages with his fascinating ways ; there is never any
lack of interest when you have a Rook in the house that has never
known restraint and is quite natural. Dear old Jinnie was a loving,
clever, stay at home : Michael was a real rampageous schoolboy,
full of the spirit of adventure, but I must restrict myself to one
important subject that will, I think, interest our members. He was
a very wonderful talker, he chose his own subjects, and no one ever
tried to teach him. As far as I know, his repertoire was :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9885065" page_id="56215836"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
1. Michael!
2. Micha--e--1!
3. Come, Birdie ! Come, Birdie ! Mickey ! Mickey !
4. Come along ! Come along ! Come along, Birdie Micha--e--1!
5. Pardon !
6. Tis Michael!
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989823470588235" page_id="56215836"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Now 1 and 2 reproduced with perfect intonation Miss Latcham's
clear, distinct call, and my drawn out one. 3 and 4 were a mixture of
Miss Latcham's " Come, Birdie ! " and my " Come along, Birdie ! "
followed by Mickey ! Mickey ! He used to ring the changes on " Come,
Birdie ", " Come along ", and " Mickey " : you never knew what order
they would come in. 5 and 6 were picked up from our young Welsh
maid, and were given in a most distinct Welsh tone. The astonished
passer-by would be greeted with " pardon " proceeding from a Rook
on the top of the wall. Now 6 presents us with a really scientific
problem.
In answer to the question, " Who is there ? " our Welsh maid often
says, " 'Tis Hilda," instead of just " Hilda ". No one has ever said
" 'Tis Michael " yet Birdie never said " &amp;apos;Tis Hilda&amp;quot;. Pure mimicry
is consequently ruled out : the bird changed the sound, the " i " in
Hilda to the " i " in Michael, substituted another name, and that the
appropriate one, with the result that at our doors and on the window-
sill our little friend announced himself " 'Tis Michael ".

Sunday by Sunday I could be seen going to church with Michael
perched on the top of my biretta, and immediately I came out he came
to call, flying swift from the house or a tree to take up the same position.
In conclusion* I should like to say that when I read Mr. Alfred
Ezra's letter in your last issue, my sympathy for him exceeded even
my wonder at his dear little Parrakeet's accomplishments.

INHERITANCE OF COLOURS IN BUDGERIGARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980237846153846" page_id="56215837"  page_num="127" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have no desire to provoke controversy, but if you could
grant me a little space should like to make a few comments on Mrs.
Wall's letter in the last issue.
First of all, I rejoice to see that she faces the facts I gave, and
attempts neither to ignore them nor to run away from same. In its
moderate tone and its freedom from personalities Mrs. Wall's
communication is in welcome contrast to some that have been written
in the past.
Since the article I wrote for the March issue is in essentials a state-
ment of actual occurrences, I do not see how it can mislead anyone--
all can draw their own conclusions, just as I do myself.
Mrs. Wall takes exception to my statement that " theorists hold
that the three factors F.O.B. are able to account for everything
that happens in breeding the birds ", and calls my attention to the
remark by Dr. Duncker in the B.C. Bulletin--" very likely there is
a fourth factor responsible for it ". It , however, is the difference
between light and dark blues (not cobalts) and the remark has no
bearing on any of the matters touched on in my article. I in turn
would invite Mrs. Wall's consideration of two other statements in
Dr. Duncker's article (which is a condensation of one in Vogel ferner
Lander ):--
" The composition of colours in Budgies is dependent on three
different hereditary factors, which I have named F., 0., and B.
" The case of colour heredity in Budgies therefore is a so-called
triple-hybrid Mendel case, the three gens of which are acting
independently, two of the same alternatively and one intermediately."

Correspondence
These are the relevant statements, and an examination of the article
will show that the context merely emphasizes their explicit character.
I should be very sorry to do anyone an injustice, but I hold that my
statement was perfectly correct and represents the views of the
" theorists " until quite recently, though I am quite as well aware as
is Mrs. Wall that these views are undergoing modification and addition
and said so in my article.
Mrs. Wall needs no excuse for her gentle boast, her striking successes
at recent shows fully justify the same, and I take this opportunity of
tendering my congratulations. But she misquotes and misinterprets
my statement: " I do not at the moment see how the breeder of exhibi-
tion Budgerigars can gain any material advantage from the application
of these theories of colour breeding." It is not a question of being right
or wrong, but of point of view, and means exactly what it says. I do
not attempt to deny that other people may see a great deal more in
them. Mrs. Wall evidently does and attributes her successes on the
show bench to the application of Mendelian principles supplemented
by " the F.'s, O.'s, and B.'s ".
May I, without offence, ask her to consider whether she does not fall
into the same error as most of her fellow " theorists " ? Does she not
overstate the case ? There is nothing surprising in her production of
strains of cobalts, mauves, and whites, since she started with a collection
of birds which possessed all the possibilities. Her feat offers neither
confirmation nor contradiction of the theories, it has been accomplished
years ago by people who did not believe in Mendelism and also by
those who had no knowledge of it, though at the same time we must
remember that if the theorists are right, their principles will come
into action whether the breeder believes in them or not. I venture to
think that the results obtained by Mr. J. W. Marsden, myself, and a
few others in producing olives, cobalts, mauves, and whites from
greens alone presents material which bears much more directly on the
problem. These results could not, so far as I can see, have been obtained
if these ideas had been well founded. However, I say again that I
am open to conviction first, last, and all the time.
I am sorry to say, however, that Mrs. Wall has failed to convince me
of error. She has produced during recent years a certain number of

cobalts, mauves, whites, etc. But the exhibitor must of necessity con-
centrate on such points as evenness and purity of colour, regularity of
markings, size, type, condition, and since Mendelism does not deal with
these matters, I still fail to see how it can help in the production of
exhibition stock. The methods by which this is accomplished have been
well known for quite a long time. I take it that Mrs. Wall, in addition
to her experiments on these theories, has adopted a system of careful
management, including adequate housing and correct feeding, vigorous
selection of breeding stock, etc. It is, if she will pardon me, these and not
Mendelism which have produced her successes on the show bench. If
I am wrong, and she has neglected these well-known principles, then
those successes can only have been fortuitous.
While I cannot consider that Mrs. Wall's letter is in any sense an
answer to my article, I am for many reasons glad that she wrote it.
J. Bradshaw.
Sir, --It has seemed to me for some considerable time that that
portion of our English Budgerigar breeders--whom Mr. Bradshaw
styles " the theorists --are in a state of considerable mental confusion.
They do not appear to be able to distinguish between " the whole "
and "the part ", i.e. between " heredity " and " Mendelism ".
I have noticed this confusion of ideas in all contributions and in
conversations with so called Mendelists. Mrs. Wall seems to be equally
at sea. Otherwise, how can she ascribe her show successes to this
theory of colour breeding ? To put it at its highest, and take it for
granted that the experience will fall exactly into line with the theory,
this would only account for the colour of Mrs. Wall's birds, not their
show bench quality, as judged by exhibition standards.
Success on the exhibition show bench can only be obtained by a
systematic selection of good birds of known ancestry for breeding
purposes. This method has been known for ages, and is generally
called " pedigree breeding ".
I have no doubt Mrs. Wall has operated along these lines, with
undoubtedly a keen eye for colour.
If anyone is misled, it will be by Mrs. Wall's letter, and not by

Mr. Bradshaw's article--which, stripped of its undercurrent of gentle
raillery, is " a catalogue of facts
To put forward one isolated remark mentioned tentatively in the
closing sentence of an article, and to disregard the whole tenor and
purport of that article, scarcely suggests close examination, and is
certainly not fair comment.
I wish Mrs. Wall every success in the future and think her success
in the past has been well merited ; but I suggest to her that it would be
more helpful to others if they were encouraged to follow her methods
rather than her " theories ".

This is perhaps the most beautiful of a very beautiful genus. It
inhabits French Indo-China from Cambodgia and Cochin China to the
South and as far as N.E. Tonkin to the north ; it is particularly
.abundant in the middle and north of Annam.
Like all the genus it is essentially a ground bird although it
roosts in trees ; though probably plentiful where it occurs, it is not
often seen, owing to its predilection for woodlands. It is not easy
to shoot, but can be snared. It is a bird of the plains, never met
with higher than 400 metres above sea-level.
Until 1928 the species was only known by the type male and female
;skins in the Paris Museum which were presented by Dr. Harmand
in 1874 and 1877, but in 1928 two cocks and a hen were captured at
Thua-Lun and brought back alive.
The sexes differ greatly in appearance, as is well shown by the
plate. Those in the North Hall aviaries are in beautiful condition
and very tame. Unluckily, like the rest of their family, they quarrel
fiercely among themselves and only one can be kept at liberty in a
*compartment, though they are perfectly harmless to other species,
even the weakest and most defenceless.

A. A. Prestwick--The Parrots at Primley
They are very silent and in spite of their brilliant colouring are
readily overlooked from their habit of choosing a corner and standing
motionless. They quickly become tame, even familiar, and those in
Mr. Lewis' aviaries enjoy a game with their keeper, snapping and
feinting at his fingers when he puts in their food or cleans their cage.
On grass they pause and listen for worms just as our Song Thrush
does after a shower.
They are greedy birds and must not be allowed to become too fat.
Those in Mr. Lewis' aviary were brought by Mr. Webb along with
other rarities taken in the Delacour expedition of 1928.

nearly one hundred and twenty species of Parrots and Parrot-like

been represented in captivity by a finer series, except perhaps that at
the London Zoological Gardens. There are, of course, examples of

In carrying on the self-imposed task of giving some account of the
trials and tribulations of a Bird-keeper to others of that cult, it is
necessary to state that I do not pretend to be an expert, nor do I
keep the rare and expensive birds we hear so much of in our Magazine,
simply because I cannot afford to and have not the room to do so if I
could.
There is no doubt that the keeping of large numbers and species
of birds in one aviary, however large, is one of the causes which militate
against aviculture in its true sense, i.e. the rearing and care of birds.
Therefore if one wishes to rear birds, and not only keep them, the
fewer the species the better the results. There is nothing new about
this ; we have been told it before by other members of our Society
of greater experience than I, but I do think it requires emphasizing.

J. Appleby--Notes from a Lancashire Aviary
Then a point over which we have no control is the age of birds
when purchased. If one is lucky enough to receive young birds,
one is assured of greater success in acclimatizing them. Then the sexing
of immature birds is a difficulty not always in our hands. We buy
pairs that are too divergent in age or which turn out to be the same
sex but different ages.
When these difficulties are not present and all goes well, pairs well
matched and in good condition, nesting proceeding according to plan
and young hatched, then comes another trouble which I must confess
has stumped me. I refer to the procuring of live food of a suitable
nature with which the old birds can feed their young.
Since last April the population of my aviary has fluctuated, but
I begin this year with two more birds than last.
Deaths have been no more numerous than in previous years,
despite the severe winter, and with few exceptions have been from
natural causes. I have had less trouble with cats. They seem to
have discovered that the vicinity of the aviary is dangerous. My
Owl friend has done me a good turn, for mice are distinctly less
troublesome ; in fact I have not had one in the aviary this winter,
and judging from the casts I find close to the aviary Mr. Owl's diet
is chiefly mice. He is also keeping the Sparrow population to moderate
limits. Only the other night I saw him fly into the ivy on the house,
flush several Sparrows, and get one in a fir tree to which it had flown.
As all my birds roost indoors or else in thick bush, except the Siskin,
which still roosts in the open, the Owl either does not see them or
has decided they are sour grapes.
The chief cause of death among adults is damp cold, pneumonia
following chill unless the bird is caught up and caged as soon as
noticed below par.
Following advice given me in the Magazine last June by Lord
Tavistock, I have saved several from untimely death. Gin and
glycerine or whisky and water, according to ailment, are excellent
remedies, together with heat; one can hardly overdo the latter
short of roasting. Bovril gives tone and is an easy way of supplying
animal food in their drinking water.
I have lost several birds, in perfect condition so far as one

could see, from fatty heart and liver; in other words from over-
feeding.
Now here is a difficulty I should be glad to know how to overcome.
Given fifty birds of twenty-five different species in one aviary,
requiring different seeds, from rice and oats to millet and maw seed,
how is one to see that they are all getting enough and not too much ?
Nesting last year was good but not successful. Pekin Kobins
had four nests, three eggs in each, and hatched out three chicks in
each nest, reared them until the quills began, they then died. The
weather was favourable all the time, but with the exception of live
stock caught by the old birds in the aviary, mealworms were the only
live food I could give them. Other so-called live food is supplied but
was not acceptable.
It was distressing to see the anguish of the old birds as one after
another the young died for want of something I could not supply. If
they had built in a section of the aviary I can shut off I would have
risked giving the old birds their liberty, for they are the friendliest
birds I possess.
The Grey Javas did not nest a second time and the White are
only just now thinking of starting housekeeping.
Grey Singing Finches had three nests and again reared young
up to about ten days old, which then died.
Fire Finches nested in January, but after laying two eggs ceased
operations; too cold, I fancy. They were outdoors, but under
a roof.
The Masked Grass Finches carried their domestic arrangements
no further than building a nest. These together with the Longtailed
and Gouldian Finches have been caged since last October. Zebra
Finches have had many nests and one nest I had to remove last week
contained thirteen eggs, all rotten except two ; result, five young out
of three pairs. They have a habit of dropping eggs on the floor
instead of in the nest.
It is necessary to separate the Fire Finch sexes in the winter or
the cocks will peck their partners to pieces. I had a misfortune due
to an oversight. I lost all my Silverbills ; they found a way out of the
aviary through a small space between a wall and the horizontal pipe

carrying the wire, just large enough to allow them to get through,
and as they all kept in a flock one must have discovered the exit
and the rest followed. This I only discovered when looking for the
means of egress obtained by a cock Zebra was behind a clump of
gorse put up for nesting purposes and which the Silverbills used freely.
That exit is now blocked. It was rather singular that I never saw
any sign of them about.
Some birds died of over-feeding, others I lost because they would
not eat or what they did eat did them no good. Mr. C. H. Hicks
advised me to use sprouted seed, which I have done. I am now trying
a trace of iodine in the drinking water of any bird I have caged and
which require keeping in good condition : just enough tincture of
iodine to make the water in the drinker look rusty. One week iodine,
one week without. All I can say about it at present is that all the
birds so treated are in topping feather and condition. Orange Bishop
going through the moult was caught up in January and given this
treatment and good feeding. He is now out and in the flight again
in eclipse plumage, quite fit and well.
I am at present debating the same treatment for a Paradise
Whydah who has just lost his long tail feathers, but as he seems quite
fit at large, and moulted all right last year in the open, I may leave
him out.
So although I have had few successes and many losses I shall
continue to keep on trying to improve the conditions of my birds and
shall be grateful for any sound advice on their maintenance.
[We are very grateful to Mr. Appleby for these interesting notes,
and hope that other members will supply accounts of their aviaries
and methods of treatment.-- Ed.]
THE STORY OF A PIGEON
By E. Maud Knobel
My room has two windows in it, one is generally shut, and has three
or four Parrots hanging in it, the other is mostly open but has wire
over it. Coming into the room one very wet morning last June, I saw

a poor little half-fledged Pigeon pressed against the window that was
shut. It was nearly drowned with the rain, and looked the picture of
misery. I went to the open window, took down the wire, and held out
some food in my hand and called it. It ran along the parapet, though it
was so sodden it could hardly move, and took the food. I got some more
food and enticed it into the room. After a good meal it settled down on
my dressing-table to dry itself, and later I found it asleep on the same
spot. After a time it went out of the window, and I was relieved to
see that it could fly. I thought to myself, well, that is the end of that.
Great, therefore, was my surprise on waking next morning to see the
Pigeon looking in through the wire waiting to be fed. Of course I
immediately took the wire down and gave him a good meal. All the
summer he came regularly, and he kept his times so well that one could
rely almost to the minute on when he would arrive. His times were
7 a.m., 12.45, and 3.35. After his meals he generally had a good preen,
and then went to sleep, either on the corner of my dressing-table
or in the middle of my bed, a place I did not much care about.
Sometimes he visited the Parrots and sat on their cages, but not often.
After a time his visits became less, and he only came once a day, either
at 12.45 or 3.45. But during the great cold in February he frequently
came early in the morning, and if not let in immediately would tap at
the window. He seemed starved with the cold and hunger.
He has moulted into a very handsome dark bird, nearly black, with
a beautiful iridescent neck. Lately he has brought his fiancee, and he
will make love to her just outside the window very early in the morning
and wake me up ; it is very inconvenient of him. She is much lighter in
colour than he and a good deal bigger. She is rather shy and won't
often come in, but if she does she waits until he has finished.
I suppose I shall have to expect the family next, and fear I may
find them quite an expensive item.

By T. H. Newman
The Ground Doves and Pigeons are placed in the sub-family
Geotrygonince. They are robust birds with stout and rather long legs,
the wings are short, broad and rounded, but the primaries are
distinctly longer than the secondaries. In their wild state probably
most of the species pass much of their time on the ground, but in
captivity many only come down to feed; they do not require any
special feeding.
The Rufous-necked Wood-Dove (Aplopelia larvata), known as
the Lemon Dove in South Africa, where it is confined to the forest and
thick bush. It is generally seen on the ground seeking its food of
forest berries ; it has a short melancholy coo, and nests in low creepers
a few feet from the ground. Two specimens were presented to the
London Zoological Gardens in 1892. Upper surface olive-brown,
interscapular region slate-grey with greenish-copper edges to the
feathers ; outer tail feathers greyish towards the extremity ; front
part of head white, back of head and neck coppery-purple ; foreneck
and breast dull vinous, passing into cinnamon on lower breast.
Female a little smaller and duller. Habitat : South Africa ; a
smaller race (bronzina) in Abyssinia and Shoa.
Verreaux's Ground-Dove ( Leptoptila verreauxi). In Panama
this Dove frequents the second-growth woods. In Costa Rica many
can be met with, in the forests, on the ground ; when disturbed they
get up and fly a short distance, when one can generally get quite close
to them. Eleven specimens of this species are supposed to have been
presented to the London Zoological Gardens in November, 1907,
but I see that there is a doubt as to their identity, as they may have
only been L. reichenhachii. General colour above greyish olive-
brown, back of head, nape and hind neck coppery-red with green and
purple reflection ; forehead, throat, breast and sides of body pale
vinous ; under wing-coverts and inner web of quills bright chestnut.
The first primary quill in this genus is attenuated at the tip. Habitat :

Trinidad on the east to Peru on the west. The species has been
divided into eight or nine local races.
The Grey-Crowned Ground-Dove (L. plumbeiceps). Ridgeway
calls this bird Bonaparte's Dove, doubtless because Lawrence called
it bonapartii in 1871, thinking he was describing a new species.
Nothing seems to have been recorded respecting its habits and
nidification, but they are no doubt similar to those of other members
of the genus. I do not think it has been imported into England alive,
but Mr. Delacour tells me that he has had it in France. Upper
parts plain olive-brown ; forehead greyish-white, passing through
deeper bluish-grey into slate-grey on crown, occiput and nape ;
lower hind neck and upper back faintly glossed with purple ; cheeks,
throat, fore neck and chest vinaceous buff passing into white on chin,
lower abdomen and under tail-coverts; the quills are rufous-lined
like Verreaux's Dove. Habitat : South-East Mexico to Northern
Colombia.
The Red Under-winged or Grey-fronted Ground-Dove
(L. rufaxilla) is common in British Guiana about the cane- and rice-
fields, the savannah, and also the second-growth jungle, for the
depths of which it seems to have a liking. During the rainy season,
when the savannah frequently becomes flooded, these Doves are driven
on to the well-drained estates, where they become very abundant,
though never associating in flocks. At all times it is a ground-feeder,
preferring some form of overhead cover while foraging for seeds.
Pairs are met with from August to November, when the characteristic
deep-toned " coo ", uttered at long intervals, is frequently heard.
They nest in small trees, tall bushes, or even on the ground at the
roots of small trees and bushes. Upper parts greenish olive-brown,
with lilac reflections on mantle, upper back and lesser upper wing-
coverts ; forehead whitish, crown slaty-grey with a tinge of lilac on
nape ; cheeks and lower throat sandy-buff, chin white ; breast
vinous, fading into white on under tail-coverts ; axilliaries and under
wing-coverts bright rufous like the greater portion of the quill lining.
Habitat : North-East Brazil, Guiana, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
Reichenbach's or Rufous Ground-Dove (L. reichenbachii ).
Burmeister tells us this was one of the commonest Doves he met with

T. H. Neivman--Ground Doves and Pigeons
in the forest region. He did not find it in the open, but only on the
narrow forest paths, where it could easily escape danger ; it builds
its nest rather high up amongst the thick trees. This species was
first bred by the late Miss Alderson, who has given us an interesting
account in the Avicultural Magazine, Yol. II (2), p. 270. It has
also nested in other aviaries. I had three specimens, but do not think
they nested. Wings and back olive-brown ; forehead whitish
shading into bluish-grey on the crown; back of head, nape and upper
mantle glossed with purple ; chin and middle of throat white ;
cheeks, sides of neck and breast deep reddish-vinous fading into white
on the under tail-coverts. The young bird is much duller and has
chestnut margins to the feathers of the wings and breast. Habitat:
South-East Brazil and Uruguay.
The Green-naped Ground-Dove ( L . chlorauchenia). There is
some doubt whether the proper name for this species is not dial -
cauchenia ; it all depends which appeared first in print. Foster
found it a common resident in Paraguay, breeding throughout the
year. It inhabits woods, spending much time on the ground, walking
briskly under the trees searching for seeds and berries. The nest is
placed in a tree some twelve feet from the ground and is a very
fragile structure. Miss Alderson was also the first to breed this Dove.
She kindly gave me the young cock bird which she reared. I kept it
for about two and a half years. A full account of the nesting appeared
in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. Ill (2), p. 130. It seems to be
a very amiable species, agreeing well with even closely allied species.
General colour greyish-brown ; forehead whitish, crown, back of
head and hind neck leaden-grey with beautiful greenish-blue sheen ;
under surface of wing cinnamon ; throat and breast pale vinaceous
fading to white on chin, abdomen and under tail-coverts. The young
on leaving the nest are like their parents, but lack the vinaceous
tinge on breast and sheen on hind neck, and are generally duller and
greyer. Habitat : Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and South
Brazil.
The Orange-winged Ground-Dove ( L . ochroptera). Nothing
seems to have been written about the habits of this bird, but it seems
to differ only from the bird just described by being smaller. Two

The White-fronted or Jamaican Ground-Dove ( L. jamaicensis ).
Is by far the prettiest and most attractive member of the genus ;
it spends most of its time on the ground, picking up various seeds.
It is said to be fond of orange pips, and is very fond of cut-up pea-
nuts in captivity. It frequents woods and usually builds in rather a
low situation, often in a logwood. This is one of the nicest birds to
keep, for not only is it a very lovely bird but, like most of the species
of this group, is very gentle and amiable in disposition ; it was a
great favourite with the late Miss Alderson, who possessed many
specimens--as many as fourteen at one time. She was the first to
breed it in 1903, shortly before Mr. Castle-Sloane did so. A very full
account of the nesting, with photos of the old and young, was
published in the Avicultural Magazine, Yol. I (2), p. 395, and Vol.
II (2), p. 28, while a fine coloured plate was issued in the following
volume. Male : back and wings olive-brown, forehead white ; crown
soft ash-grey : back and sides of neck beautiful metallic pink shot
with golden or bluish-green according to the light; cheeks, throat,
and entire under parts snowy-white. Female : smaller, forehead
more greyish and the white parts not quite so pure. The young
on leaving the nest have the forehead, throat, and breast whitish-
drab ; back and wings chocolate-brown, with chestnut spots on tips
of the feathers. I had one or two pairs, but never got beyond a
few eggs. Habitat: Jamaica. A smaller race (collaris) with darker
upper parts is found in Grand Cayman Island and a paler and greyer
form ( neoxena ) inhabits St. Andrew's Island.
Wells's or Grenada Ground-Dove ( L . wellsi). No notes about
the wild habits of this Dove seem to have been published since it was
first described in 1884. They seem to have very much the habits of
Zenaida. Five were presented to the London Zoological Gardens
by Mr. Wells in 1886. The late Dr. Butler possessed a hen which
laid many eggs, Mr. 0. E. Cresswell received six in 1898, Mr. Pool
five in the same year, and Miss Alderson had a pair in 1904 ; they
seemed rather wild and not so good-tempered as most members of this
genus. A young bird was bred by Mr. H. Bright in 1926. Upper

parts brownisli-olive ; forehead pinkish-white shading to grey on
the crown ; chin and throat pure white ; cheeks, lower throat, and
breast dull vinous fading to white on chest, abdomen and under tail-
coverts cinnamon; naked skin round the eye blue. Female, as in other
species, similar but duller and forehead not so white. Habitat:
Island of Grenada, Lesser Antilles. Some of the imported birds
were supposed to have come from the neighbouring island of Tobago.
The Crested Quail-Dove or Mountain Witch ( Geotrygon
versicolor). We owe our best account of this magnificent bird to
Gosse, who tells us it inhabits the deepest glades of the most retired
mountains, walking on the ground, seeking to escape when alarmed
by its fleetness of foot. Its popular name is derived from its note,
which sounds at a distance like a groan. It feeds on seeds and nuts.
It is said to nest in the angle of the roots of trees in the month of
March. Two eggs that I have are of a pale fawn colour. According
to the latest report of the residents of the island this fine species
is now on the verge of extinction. Mr. S. T. Danforth says he flushed
a single bird on 3rd August, 1926, near Jackson Town. The London
Zoological Gardens received their first specimen in 1860. Six were
deposited in 1902, and one was purchased in May, 1904. Male
interscapulars and upper wing-coverts purplish-chestnut; lower
back, rump and upper tail-coverts dark greenish-blue shot with
purple ; primaries cinnamon, greenish at tips ; secondaries and
tail above blackish-green ; forehead blackish grey shading into olive-
brown towards the back where the feathers are elongated to form
a distinct crest ; a broad reddish stripe on the cheeks ; neck golden
green shot with purple ; throat rufescent; abdomen pale vinous ;
flanks and under tail-coverts chestnut; bill long and black. Female
with the chestnut parts paler. Habitat: Jamaica.
The Kuddy Quail-Dove ( Oreojpeleia montana) is essentially a
Ground-Pigeon, preferring a well-wooded country filled with bushes
as well as trees. The food consists of seeds, berries, and nuts, also
small slugs have been found in its gizzard. The nest is placed in a
low bush about three feet from the ground and is a rude structure,
perhaps nothing more than a few decayed leaves and two or three
dry twigs ; the eggs vary from pale cream to salmon-buff. Formerly

this bird was very common in Jamaica, but is now very scarce there,
doubtless due chiefly to its destruction by the introduced Mongoose.
In captivity this is a very gentle little Dove, it was bred by the
late Sir William Ingram. The male is bright rufous above with a
purple tinge especially on back of head, nape, sides of neck and
mantle ; a rufous stripe from base of lower mandible to the ear-
coverts, below paler reddish-purple fading to fawn on throat and
under tail-coverts. The female is dark olive above with a golden
gloss ; forehead and cheeks rufous ; throat and breast olive-brown,
lower breast and abdomen buffish. Habitat: Greater Antilles and
tropical continental America from South Mexico to Paraguay,
Bolivia and Peru.
The Martinique Quail-Dove (0. martinica). Great confusion
seems to have existed between this species and the following one. I
have not been able to find any modern notes about the habits of the
Martinique Dove. Jardine tells us it inhabits rocky districts and lives
constantly on the ground and roosts on the lowest branches of a tree.
They are found in family parties or large coveys, being wild and not
easily approached, running with great quickness when alarmed. Male :
upper parts deep chestnut, deepening into rich purplish chestnut
on hind neck and back ; forehead vinaceous-fawn ; a vinaceous-
chestnut patch across the ear-coverts ; below ochraceous-cinnamon,
paler on throat and under tail-coverts ; female has upper parts
olive-brown, lower parts cinnamon-buff. Habitat: Central Lesser
Antilles--Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, Santa Lucia and
St. Vincent; said to have been exterminated by the Mongoose from
the last-named island.
The Key West Quail-Dove (0. chrysia) is common and resident
in Cuba. It walks with neck contracted and the tail slightly raised,
preferring rocky and wooded regions. It likes to perch on horizontal
limbs of trees and in the densely timbered portions it may be seen
searching among the leaves for food which consists of fruits, seeds,
small snails, etc. In 1908 our late President, Mr. Astley, received a
female specimen from Cuba which I was able to identify for him.
He kindly sent me the body when it died. I found one of the three
skins in the British Museum belonged to a bird which had formerly

T. H. Newman--Ground Doves and Pigeons
lived in the London Zoological.Gardens, so that it does not seem correct
to say that the two birds purchased in July, 1924, were the first
exhibited there. It is represented in several aviaries in France at
the present time ; Madame Lecallier has some and Monsieur Decoux
has I believe bred the species at Gery. Male : forehead brownish-
red changing into metallic green on crown, occiput and nape ; rest
of upper parts cinnamon with feathers edged with brilliant metallic
purple, more golden on lower back and rump; lesser upper wing-coverts
have brilliant metallic purple edges ; a white stripe from bill to the
ear-coverts ; under surface greyish-white, a vinaceous tinge on lower
throat and upper breast. The female is duller with a good deal of
pale brown on the wings. Habitat: Haiti, Cuba, Bahamas and
Florida Keys.
The Moustache or Bridled Quail-Dove (0. mystacea). Grisdale
tells us that this Dove was exceedingly numerous on the little
luxuriant island of Montserrat, especially so on the lower slopes
near the sea. It is about the size of a Quail, and its flight is very
short and low. Russ found its habits in captivity peculiar, as it spent
most of its time perched on high branches and ate raw meat, hard-
boiled egg, bread and red currants, as well as seed. Forehead brownish
shading into green ; head, neck and mantle metallic-green becoming
bright purple on upper back ; rest of upper surface olive-brown ;
primaries and outer tail-feathers cinnamon ; a broad stripe across
cheeks and the throat whitish, a second stripe on cheeks brown ;
front of neck and crop region reddish fading through pale vinous
to whitish on middle of abdomen ; under tail-coverts pale cinnamon.
Habitat : Lesser Antilles and Culebra and St. Croix of Greater
Antilles. A race with more deeply coloured under parts (sabde) is
found on Saba Island, Lesser Antilles.
The Grey-headed Quail-Dove (0. caniceps). Although this
is only a recent addition to our aviaries, it has been bred at least in
three places. Mme. Lecallier seems to have been the first to rear
young birds. M. Decoux has reared certainly one bird ; he gives
an interesting account of his experiences in UOiseau for October,
1925. Mr. A. Ezra was the first to breed a young one in England--
in 1925; he gives us an account in the Avicultural Magazine for

December, 1925. This species now seems very rare in Cuba, where it
lives mostly on the ground in thickly wooded parts and is threatened
with extinction by the increasing cultivation of the country. Male :
forehead whitish-grey changing into dark grey on the top of the head ;
neck dark grey with green and violet reflections ; back glossy violet
changing into dark blue on the rump ; throat whitish ; breast grey ;
middle of abdomen reddish-white ; under tail-coverts cinnamon ;
wings greyish-brown with purple and green reflections. Female :
smaller and duller than the male. Habitat: Confined to Cuba.
The Venezuelan Quail-Dove (0. venezuelensis) . This is another
rare bird of which nothing seems to have been recorded about its
habits, but they would not be likely to differ from those of other
members of the genus. Four specimens were presented to the London
Zoological Society in August, 1909. Above rufous-brown; mantle
purplish-blue ; lesser wing-coverts tinged with purple ; primaries
slaty-brown ; forehead rufous becoming vinous on crown and purplish-
vinous on back of head, bounded on the sides by grey : sides of head
whitish, rufous towards mandible ; a blackish line below the cheeks ;
throat white, greyish-vinous on breast, rest of under surface reddish-
brown fading to whiter on centre of abdomen. Habitat: Venezuela.
Chapman in 1917 considered that this is not a valid form and should
be united with the Colombian Quail-Dove (0. linearis). At most it
cannot be more than a race of this species; other races have been
described from Colombia (Santa Marta), Venezuela (Paria Pen),
and Trinidad.
The Bleeding-heart Pigeon ( Gallicolumba luzonica). It is
strange that so little should have been recorded about the wild life of
this most beautiful bird about which even legends have been written ;
as its long legs and powerful feet indicate, the birds are invariably found
on the ground in the forest; they run very rapidly and in close cover
frequently escape in this way without taking wing ; when flushed
they generally alight on the ground again and run rapidly after
alighting. The snow-white breast with its brilliant red centre spot
has always called attention to this Dove so that it has been much
sought after for keeping in captivity. It was first bred in the London
Zoological Gardens in 1887. Miss Alderson had several pairs and

T. H. Newman--Ground Doves and Pigeons
reared young. She gives us a description of her birds in the
Avicultural Magazine,. Vo]. I (2), p. 132, with a photo of two
of her young birds. I had one or two pairs, but never bred the
species. Since the war it has become very scarce in England, but
I note that it is represented in several French aviaries at the present
time. Forehead whitish, shading into delicate grey on the crown ;
back of neck with purplish maroon tinge ; upper surface greyish-
brown shot with bronzy-emerald green ; upper wing-coverts reddish-
brown broadly tipped with bluish-grey forming three bands across
the wings ; throat and fore neck pure white ; a bright red spot
composed of hair-like feathers on the centre of the breast, rest of
under parts tinged with buffy-salmon, whiter on abdomen and under
tail-coverts. The female is smaller with a shorter and thinner bill,
and generally more buff on the under-parts. One bird which I picked
out for a cock because of its white forehead and very large red breast
patch, turned out to be a hen, so these are not signs of sex. Habitat :
Luzon, Philippine Islands.
Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon (G. crinigera) is the richest
and most harmoniously coloured species of a most beautiful group of
Doves. Mr. W. Goodfellow, in a letter to me about the birds he
obtained in Mindanao, wrote that these birds are by no means common
in their own country and are very locally distributed around the
.somewhat drier parts of the coast lands, they are forest birds, but do not
perch in the trees. He remarks that when one of the birds got into a
weak state on the voyage home, a few scraps of raw meat a day quite
pulled it round ; the birds were very fond of a little soaked bread or
soft food. Four specimens were purchased by the London Zoological
Gardens in 1863, and two young were reared. I obtained a pair in
1907 which reared one young bird the following year, both my bird
and those in the London Zoological Gardens only laid one egg at each
sitting. An account of the nesting will be found in the Avicultural
Magazine, Yol. YII (2), pp. 225, accompanied by an excellent coloured
plate of the adult and young, also some photos of the nest and young.
Head, back, and sides of neck and mantle metallic, green ; upper
surface rich chestnut; lesser wing-coverts grey glossed with bronze-
green ; median and greater coverts tipped with grey forming bands

across the wing ; all the smaller feathers edged with metallic green,
purple or pink, according to the angle seen, while the green of the head
and neck glows emerald-like in the sun. Chin and throat pure white
which descends in a narrow line down each side of the breast, dividing
the green of the sides of the neck from the large crimson-maroon
patch on the breast; this is much larger than in the common species
and is composed of longer feathers of an even harsher and stiffer
texture. The bases in both species are white ; rest of under surface
rich fawn colour ; iris beautiful lilac, like the bloom on a grape. The
female is smaller, duller and with weaker bill. The young differs in
having the crown dull chestnut, only the nape being green; the edges
of the wing-coverts are pale fawn instead of grey, the throat is duller
white, which is not continued in a line down the sides of the neck,
the red patch on the breast appears when the bird is about two months
old. Habitat: Mindanao, Philippine Islands. The bird from Basilan
is smaller and has been called G. c. hasilanica, while another form from
Leyte, Sulu Arch, has been named G. c. leytensis, about the same
size as the last named, the sides of the neck are greyer and the green
gloss extends lower, below and beneath the red patch. I do not
think any more specimens have reached England since my birds,
but I believe Mme. Lecallier has some in her splendid collection
in France.

A FINE COLLECTION OF PAPUAN BIRDS
I have seen many collections of birds arrive from foreign parts,
but never have I seen birds come home in more perfect condition than
those in a collection from Papua which was brought home on 13th May
by Mr. Shaw Mayer, who has been collecting for Mr. Spedan Lewis.
Almost every bird is in perfect plumage and fit for keen competition
on the show-bench. Even the Birds of Paradise, of which there are
some forty specimens, have their plumes intact and spotless.
Of Paradise Birds there are four Lesser ( Paradisea minor), three
males and one female ; nine Twelve-wired ( Seleucides ignotus), seven
males and two females ; seven Six-plumed (Parotia sefilata), five males
and two females ; six Wallace's Standard-wings ( Semioptera wallacei),
five male and one female ; three Wilson's (Schlegelia wilsoni), one
male and two females ; six King's (Cicinnurus regius), five males and
one female; and four Magnificent (Diphyllodes magnificus). The
remainder of the collection contains some fine Parrots, of which may
be specially mentioned a pair of the rare Lory, Eos histrio from Sangi
Island and a rare Aprosmictus, probably A. dorsalis. There is a fine
Grackle clad in black and golden, entirely new to aviculture and
belonging to the genus Melanopyrrhus. There are three very beautiful
Kingfishers with white heads and underparts, greenish-blue backs,
and blue wings and tails. Mr. Mayer reared them from the nest in the
island of Almahera. They appear to be Halcyon albicilla, and are
probably new to aviculture. There is a beautiful specimen of that

Mr. William E. Glegg's History of the Birds of Essex will be welcomed
by the large number of Londoners who are interested in the birds of
their district, for the county, roughly 42 miles square, is particularly
rich in bird life. Of its woods, comprising some 47J square miles, the
chief is Epping Forest, running practically into London, and a rare
place for woodland birds such as the Hawfinch, Wood Wren, Redstart,
and Greater-spotted Woodpecker. Garden Warblers, Lesser White-
throats, Nightingales, etc., are found in the thick undergrowth of its
commons. The Lea Valley Reservoirs form the most important part
of the fresh water of the county, stretching, as they do, along the Lea
Valley for a distance of 6J miles. Here is a large colony of the
Crested Grebe; Tufted Ducks rear numerous broods, the Reed
Warbler is common, and many Yellow Wagtails nest. Here also
Wildfowl gather in large numbers during the winter.
The coast is deeply indented by estuaries and creeks in which
Waders of many species abound; Wigeon and Brent Geese are numerous
in the winter, and Sheld-duck breed in increasing numbers. There
are at least six nesting colonies of the Black-headed Gull, and four of
the Little Tern on the Essex coast.
Altogether Essex is a good bird county, which well deserved an
up-to-date ornithological history, the previous book on the subject,
The Birds of Essex , by Mr. Miller Christy, having been published
thirty-nine years ago. Mr. Glegg has done his work well and produced
a splendid book, in the production of which he has received valuable
help from the late Mr. Miller Christy, who placed at his disposal his
unpublished supplement to his Birds of Essex. The value of the book
is enhanced by the inclusion of twenty photographic plates and an
excellent map of the county.

Sir, --One of our members, Captain Scott Hopkins, of Kirby-
moorside, near York, has witbin the period of twelve months got
together a fine collection of Pheasants. These include :--
Two pairs of Bornean Firebacks,
Two pairs of Diardi Firebacks,
One pair of Nepal Kaleege,
Two pairs of Impeyans,
Two pairs of Elliotts,
One pair of Peacock Pheasants,
One pair of Swinhoe,
Four pairs of Satyr Tragopan,
in addition to the commoner sorts, such as Goldens, Silvers
Amherst, Reeves, and Melanistic.
The aviaries, which were built after Captain Hopkins' own design,
are in my opinion ideal.
Captain Hopkins will be only too pleased to show the birds to
any members or their friends passing through the district. I might
mention for the sake of motorists that Kirbymoorside is adjoining
some of the finest dale scenery in Yorkshire.

Sir, --For the last three years, since I have had suitable aviaries
and been able to rear some Quail and Hemipodes, I have had to rely
upon gentles which are quite good enough for that purpose. Last
year I utterly failed to get any live ants' eggs beyond the few which
the garden supplied. I had about half a dozen nests of Dufresne's
Waxbills and the same number from Green Avadavats, but not a
single egg contained a young bird. I believe that was owing to the
fact that the parents had to live on hard seeds and so-called
insectivorous mixture.

reply : " There is no demand for them." Last week I was at Gamage's

but they have to be got from Germany by aeroplane in bulk, and
they must have sufficient orders to be able to send off all of them
directly, as they will not keep. I think with our long list of members
there must be many in my circumstances. If so, I wish they would
write to Messrs. Gamage and say how many they will take per week
during the season. H. L. Sigh.

ALEXANDRINE PARRAKEETS : INCUBATION PERIOD

Sir,--A pair of Alexandrines in my possession laid three eggs
on 23rd, 25th and 27th March. The hen apparently started to sit
with the first egg, and hatched out three young on 23rd April. As
this is twenty-eight days from the last egg I thought it worth while
letting you know, as all information I have been able to obtain has
given the period of incubation as twenty-two to twenty-four days.
The same pair of birds laid three eggs last season, hatching one chick,
which she reared, and then nearly killed herself eating the bad eggs
when she cleaned her nest. Period of incubation last year was twenty-
eight days from last egg. C. Heydon.
THE BIRD COLLECTION IN THE NEW YORK ZOO
Sir, --I notice that in the Avicultural Magazine for March,
1929, Mr. A. A. Prestwich states that 150 species of birds are " more
than can be seen in any of the American Zoos at one time ". This
is a small matter, of course, and quite obviously a slip, but I should be
sorry to have the members of the Avicultural Society think that the
Zoological Parks of America have fallen to such a low estate. In
our own collection, we try to maintain an average of 800 species.
We have at the present time 760 species. Several other institutions,

Sir, --I wonder if any of our members can explain the non-reliability
of Reeve's Pheasants in regard to breeding. I heard of several pens
last year where hens laid no eggs and in some cases where eggs were
laid they were unfertile. I have also heard of two cases recently where
cocks are not mating with hens.

When in Berlin in 1912 I was greatly interested in the number of
full-winged Carolina Ducks in the neighbourhood of the Zoological
Gardens. They were breeding freely in boxes fastened high up in
the trees, and I was told that some actually found nesting accommoda-
tion on the roofs of houses. It was very pleasant the other day to meet
my old friends Dr. and Mrs. Heinroth from the Berlin Zoological
Gardens, and I asked how the Carolinas had prospered. The experiment
which at first appeared to be so successful had proved eventually to be
a failure. The birds had unaccountably died or strayed and eventually
they practically died out.
Now, I am told, the Mandarin Duck has entirely taken the place of
the Carolina and is numerous in the wooded district surrounding the
Zoological Gardens and actually in the gardens themselves and there
is no sign of any deterioration. Dr. Heinroth thinks that this species
is better adapted for acclimatization in Europe than is the Carolina,
and this has also been the experience of those who have tried the
two species in England. Sir Richard Graham tried both species some
years ago at Netherby, and the Mandarin succeeded admirably while
the Carolina failed, chiefly, I gathered, from its propensity for straying.
Now what could be more attractive than a number of full-winged
Mandarin Ducks in the London Parks ? All the conditions are there
for their successful establishment, plenty of trees and a number of

ponds, large and small, and complete protection. What we want
is for someone to give us the birds or the wherewithal to purchase
them, say 50 pairs. These would be placed, unpinioned but with
clipped flights, say in St. James' Park, one of the Hampstead ponds
and the Zoological Gardens, providing, of course, the necessary
permission could be obtained.
At first these birds would be unable to fly, and while in this condition
would become tame and accustomed to their surroundings. When the
moulting season came they would regain their power of flight, but,
unless I am much mistaken, they would remain in the neighbourhood
and breed in the trees providing suitable nesting boxes were available,
for the Mandarin Duck naturally nests in hollow trees, sometimes at
a considerable height from the ground.
In China, we are told, the Mandarin Duck is carried in wedding
processions, and is regarded as a symbol of conjugal fidelity. There is
good reason for this it would seem, for of all the Duck tribe this seems
to be the last to bestow its affections elsewhere than upon its lawful
mate. Hybrids amongst Ducks are common, but who has ever seen
one of which the Mandarin was one of the parents ?
No less than eight examples of the Derby an Parrakeet have reached
this country within the last few weeks, six of these having gone into
Mr. Ezra's aviaries. Others have gone to Prance. We shall hope to
hear that this very fine species has been bred in this country soon,
for it will surely breed as readily as any other of the Ring-neck group.
It is not long ago that it was extremely rare in Europe and many will
recollect the excitement that prevailed when one was exhibited under
the name of " Salvadori's Parrakeet ", which is only another name
for the same bird.
The old Foreign Bird Exhibitors' League has been revived under the
title of the " Foreign Bird Exhibitors' Association " with the Marquess
of Tavistock as President and Mr. John Frostick as Chairman. The
annual subscription has been fixed at 5s. The Association has as its

THE VISIT TO FOXWARREN

<bodyText confidence="0.9988311875" page_id="56215874"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
Mr. and Mrs. Ezra's kind invitation to spend the afternoon of
Saturday, 25th May, at Foxwarren Park was accepted by over sixty
members of the Society, who spent a most enjoyable afternoon. The
journey was made by car, a large charabanc having been provided
by Mr. Ezra, and many private cars participating. The weather
was perfect.
The collection of birds at Foxwarren is one of the best, if not the
best, private collections in the world and the members present thoroughly
appreciated the opportunity of viewing so many rarities in the splendid
range of aviaries and the bird-room. After tea a tour was made of the
large and beautiful fenced-in park, where Antelopes, Deer and
Wallabies, Cranes and many other species of birds roam in freedom.
A recently constructed lake containing many rare Waterfowl was
much admired.
The party left with very grateful thanks to their kind host and
hostess for a most enjoyable afternoon.

under which they are kept are suitable, for not only are they very
ornamental but they are easily kept and most of them are hardy.
The Crowned Lapwing (Stejphanibyx coronatus) was introduced
into this country in 1925, when Mr. Webb brought some home for
Messrs, damage. Mr. Ezra bought some, and the Zoological Society
secured a pair. The species occurs in South and East Africa, where
it is a resident species which is generally met with in small flocks of
twenty or so individuals. It is a handsome bird, conspicuous by its
peculiarly ornamented crown, the centre of which is black, surrounded
by a broad white ring which is again surrounded by another of black.
The upper parts generally are olive-brown, the under parts and tail
white, the latter with &amp;apos;a black transverse band, the bill, legs, and
feet being red.
The pair at the Zoo have, for the last year, shared with several
other Plovers the large corner aviary outside the Bird House. Here, in
March, they selected a spot within a foot of the wire netting separating
them from the public path, and collected a few stems of grass and a
few pebbles, which was all the nest they made. Two eggs were laid,
and in spite of the crowds of visitors within a few inches of them, sat

steadily, both birds taking turns in incubation. The cold weather at
the time was probably responsible for the two eggs failing to hatch.
A second attempt was made on the same spot in May, this time three
eggs, a normal clutch, being laid. Incubation lasted for twenty-four
days, when all three eggs hatched successfully, in spite of the attempts
of visitors to feed the sitting bird on bread and monkey-nuts !
The feeding of the chicks presents rather a problem, for the usual
insectivorous foods and mealworms are useless. I went into the country
with three large tin biscuit boxes and returned with them full of
ants' nests. With a trowel we dug the best parts out of nests of the
small red ant that is so numerous on downlands. The boxes contained
more soil than anything else, but amongst the soil were lots of tiny ant
grubs, pupae, eggs, and, of course, ants themselves.
The chicks are very beautiful, clad in pale buff down, spotted with
black on the back, and with the head decorated with a crown like
that of the parents.

The Papuan Golden-heart Pigeon or Rufous-crowned Ground-
Dove (G . rufigula). In New Guinea this bird is quite common, but
is very wary and takes flight at the least alarm; a nest was found
very close to the ground, the sitting bird being extremely wild. The
single egg was of a regular oval form somewhat pointed towards the
smaller end ; it was white, faintly tinged with cream-colour and
somewhat glossy. Four specimens were deposited in the London
Zoological Gardens in September, 1915. Forehead and front part of
head rufous-buff, paler on the former, upper parts vinous-chestnut,
a greyish shade on occiput, nape and upper back ; wing-coverts with
grey tips, producing four grey bands across the wing ; a grey band from
above the eye along the sides of the occiput; cheeks pale vinous ;
under surface yellowish-white, a yellow-ochraceous patch of long stiff

feathers on the middle of the breast; flanks and under tail-coverts deep
buff. Habitat: Greater part of New Guinea (except the south) and
N.W. Papuan Islands. In October, 1912, the London Zoological
Society purchased an example of the Aru Golden-heart (G . r. hel-
viventris). I believe Mr. Gifford has also had it in America. I was much
struck with the remarkable Rail-like appearance of this bird as it ran
swiftly about when alarmed. It only differs from typical rufigula
by the absence of the grey band on the sides of the occiput. Habitat:
South New Guinea and Aru Islands.
Beccari's Ground-Pigeon ( G . ( Pampusana ) beccarii). I have not
heard of this rare Pigeon being imported to England, but I think
Mr. Gifford has kept it in America. I am keeping this section distinct
from the typical " Heart " Doves which all have a patch of stiff hair-
like feathers on the breast. In the division Pampusana this patch is
absent, but the breast is covered with a shield of feathers coloured
differently from the rest of the under-surface. Typical beccarii has the
fore part of the head and neck, throat and breast-shield grey, the latter
bordered with lighter grey; vertex, occiput, nape and upper parts
dark olive ; smaller wing-coverts and band below the breast-shield
glossed with purple; rest of under-surface dark greyish-brown.
Habitat: North West New Guinea. The bird from Duke of York Island
and New Ireland ( G . (P.) b. johannce) has a paler grey head and breast-
shield, a very dark form ( G . (P.) b. solomonensis) from the Solomon
Islands and other races from the Admiralty Islands, St. Matthias and
Bougainville Islands.
Stair's Ground-Pigeon (G. (P.) stairi). Unlike any other Fijian
Pigeon seeks its food entirely on the ground. Here it runs as quickly
as a Quail, springs to its wings on the least alarm, and glides through
the underwood to a place of safety with the rapidity of lightning.
It breeds in low bushes, making a flimsy nest, never out of the reach of
a man's hand, and lays two white eggs. In captivity it is so timid
that when approached it instantly runs into a corner and crouches
down just as a Quail would do. This species has been exhibited in the
London Zoological Gardens, but not since 1883 I think, but it has been
imported into America recently. Forehead, sides of head and neck
with breast-shield vinaceous-rufous, becoming white on chin and

round the breast, the breast bounded behind by a deep maroon band ;
back of head and neck slate-coloured shot with green ; rest of upper
surface glossy brown shot with bronze and purple ; lesser upper wing-
coverts edged with purple ; rest of under-surface dark brown. Female
smaller with shorter bill; breast-shield pale chocolate. Habitat :
Samoa, Fiji and Tonga Islands.
The White-breasted Ground-Pigeon (G. ( P .) jobiensis). This
fine species has been imported in some numbers during the last few
years, so that specimens have been distributed not only in England
and France but also in America, where it has been called the Black-
fronted Amethyst. It has shown itself quite ready to nest in captivity,
but I do not think any account has yet been published. General colour
slaty-black, feathers of hind neck, mantle, upper back, scapulars and
upper wing-coverts edged with beautiful amethyst-purple; lores,
sides of forehead, superciliary stripe as well as throat and breast-shield
pure white. Female smaller with an olive tint on lower back and rump
and with the black and white parts not so pure. The young are brown,
with narrower superciliary stripe and only the throat whitish. Habitat:
New Guinea, Jobi, Duke of York Group and New Britain.
The White-fronted Amethyst Ground-Pigeon (G. ( P .) kubaryi).
Mr. E. W. Gifford, of Oakland, California, who specializes in rare species
of Partridge Pigeons and Quail Doves, has this Dove in his collection,
but I have not come across any mention of the bird in Europe. As
may be expected from a bird of its habitat, next to nothing seems to
have been written about the wild habits of Kubary's Pigeon, it seems to
be confined to the interior of the woods, where it lives chiefly on the
ground and therefore easily escapes observation. This species is very
like the last described, but differs in having the back of the head and
nape slate-grey, the purple of the mantle is even more brilliant and the
forehead and anterior part of the head is white. Habitat: Caroline
Islands.
The Buff-hooded Ground-Pigeon (G. (P.) xanthonura). This is
another species which Mr. Gifford has. It was formerly known under
the name of pampusan which Bonaparte made the type of his genus

wing-coverts broadly margined with purple violet; forebead, anterior
part of cheeks and crop-shield dull white tinged with buff, rest of under
parts brownish-black ; the outer tail feathers have a broad subterminal
dusky brown band. Female has the upper part of the head cinnamon,
the back has an olive lustre, and the upper wing-coverts have rufous
edges; under surface more rufous. Habitat: Marianne Islands,
Guam, Carolines and Mackenzie Islands.
The Grey-hooded or Marquesas Ground-Pigeon ( G . (P.)
rubescens). Until the year 1920 this species was only known from an old
plate published in 1814. An American expedition then visited the
Marquesas Islands and brought back a number of living birds ; in 1923
Mr. Gifford received no less than thirty-one specimens ; he put them
to very good use, so that soon a number of young birds were reared
and distributed in the zoological parks at New York, Washington and
Milwaukee; one male bird was sent from New York to the London
Zoological Gardens in 1924. In France, Madame Lecallier has reared at
least seven young ones and M. Decoux has some, so that the stock has
become widely separated, and with judicious exchanges should be kept
up for many a year. Mr. Gifford gives a very full account of his birds
in The Auk for 1925, p. 388, illustrated with photos of the living birds. 1
Male : Head, neck and breast-shield grey, rest of plumage fuscous-black,
the back, scapulous and lesser wing-coverts broadly margined with
irridescent violet purple ; middle of back glossed with dark green ;
the primaries and tail feathers have their basal half white, very
conspicuous in flight. Female duller with the grey head and breast
much less defined. Habitat: Marquesas Islands.
The Blue-headed Pigeon ( Starncenas cyanocephala) is not uncommon
in Cuba in the extensive forests where it is rocky; it seems to avoid the
open country, it walks about slowly seeking its food, which consists of
seeds, berries and small snails, among the dead leaves. After feeding
it will fly into a tree and perch on a leafless horizontal limb. Nesting
takes place in April and May ; the simple nest, composed of a few
twigs, being usually placed in the tops of- parasitic vines. It lays two
rather round white eggs. Though never common it has been represented

in most collections fairly frequently since the middle of the last century ;
it was first bred in London in 1870. Quite lately Mr. Gifford had some
in America and M. Decoux has bred it in France. With the cutting of
the forests in Cuba and planting of sugar-cane their natural habitat
there is being gradually eliminated and the birds are becoming more
scarce each year, so that this is another case of trying to prolong the
life of the species by breeding it in captivity. Crown rich cobalt blue,
bordered by a black line which passes through the eye ; above olive-
brown ; a broad white band from chin, below eye to back of head ;
throat and chest black bordered below with a semi-circular white stripe ;
front and sides of black area tipped with blue ; rest of under surface
dull ferruginous. Female very similar but smaller and more slender
and not so upright in carriage. Habitat: Cuba and Florida Keys.
The W onga-wonga Pigeon ( Leucosarcia melanoleuca). This fine
species is fairly common on the Blue Mountains in New South Wales,
where one or two may be found feeding on the ground on the berries
that fall from the " Lilly-pilly " trees. When startled they rise with
a clapping noise ; when perched in a tree it will remain quiet until all
danger is passed. It nests on a horizontal branch in scrub or forest,
placing its frail nest at a height of from ten to twenty feet from the
ground ; the two eggs are smooth, glossy and pure white.
Many examples have been shown in the London Zoological Gardens.
Its large size and handsome pied plumage make it very attractive,
but its monotonous penetrating song of " hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ", which can
be heard half a mile away, is a decided drawback. It readily goes to
nest. Upper surface leaden-grey ; forehead and chin white, a whitish
line under the eye to the ear-coverts ; cheeks pale grey, gradually
deepening downwards and continuous with the leaden grey of the
breast, which is divided by a broad semi-circular white belt; chest
white in the centre, feathers of flanks and abdomen with black triangular
subterminal spots. Habitat: South Queensland, New South Wales
and Victoria. The bird from North Queensland has been called minor
on account of its smaller size.
The Green-naped Pheasant-Pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) is the
type of a most remarkable genus. Some Doves and Pigeons closely
resemble Partridges and Quails, but none is more Gallinaceous-like than

Otidiphaps which might be well mistaken for a small species of Pheasant,
indeed Salvadori, who was the great authority on the Columhiformes,
nearly described it as a new species of Megapode. The tail has twenty
feathers. The Green-naped Ground-Pigeon is not uncommon in West
New Guinea, but is extremely wary and very seldom seen. It is
essentially a ground bird, and when walking carries its tail up and has
much the appearance of a Bantam Fowl. The call is not easy to describe,
but is a sort of moaning " coo " and can be heard at a great distance.
These birds are very rare in captivity, but an example was received by
the London Zoological Society in May, 1929, and I believe it has been
imported into America. General colour including occipital crest
greenish-black, more bluish-purple on rump, lower neck and sides of
breast; hind neck bronze-green, mantle a golden lustre ; back and
wings purple-chestnut; bill and legs, which are very long, vermilion.
Habitat: West New Guinea and Batanta. Replaced in South-East
New Guinea by the Grey-naped Ground-Pigeon (0. n. cervicalis)
which inhabits the dense scrub far inland, lives on the ground, and
in habits resembles the Gouridce. This ground bird is found only
inland and in high country, it has a very plaintive note when calling,
which when imitated, brings it to one, and it then stalks to and fro with
tail erect and spread, challenging the intruder. When disturbed it
will fly into low trees and bushes, but is quickly away again. The
nest is composed of a few twigs scraped together at the foot of a low
tree in a sequestered place. The egg is pure white. Differs from typical
nobilis by its shorter crest. The nape is grey instead of green and
the lower back and rump are greener. A solitary bird of this form
was deposited at the London Zoological Gardens on 18th July, 1923,
and is still there.
The Nicobar Pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica). This remarkable bird,
together with another rather doubtful species, make up the sub-family
Caloenadince or Hackled Pigeons in which the feathers of the neck are
long and narrow and those on the head are short, the powerful hooked
bill and strong feet with formidable curved claws produce a remarkable
Vulture-looking type, reminding one rather of a Vulturine Guinea-fowl.
In captivity they can be fed on wheat, dari, hemp and maize; they are
especially fond of the last named. The Nicobar Pigeon may be termed

of insular habits; in the Solomon group they leave the mainland of the
larger islands and resort by night in thousands to roost on the small
uninhabited islands off the coast. They seek their food on the ground,
walking hither and thither, stopping every now and then and tossing
the leaves aside, dig into the ground with their bill. In the Nicobars
the small uninhabited almost inaccessible island of Batty Malve is the
only spot in which these Pigeons roost and breed, the birds are found in
thousands and almost every thick bushy tree contains several nests ;
only one egg is laid in each nest. It breeds freely in captivity and is a
very favourite cagebird throughout Asia. Owing to its large size and
rather blundering ways it requires plenty of space. General colour
metallic green with golden-coppery reflections, head and quills more
slaty-black; tail and under tail-coverts pure white. The male has a
black knob just behind the nostrils. Female smaller, duller, the neck
hackles are shorter, the knob on bill only slightly developed. Young
birds have no hackles, and the tail is slaty with greenish gloss. Habitat:
Nicobars to Celebes and Malay Archipelago. The birds from the
Pelew Islands (c. n. peleivensis) are smaller and bluer coloured.
The Crowned Pigeons are placed in a distinct family Gouridce,
they are the giants of the Order and were only exceeded in size by
the extinct Raphi or Dodos and Solitaires. They are furnished with
large crests composed of feathers with separated barbs and the tarsus
is covered with small hexogonal scales, the tail has sixteen feathers ;
their large size makes them unsuitable for any but the largest
enclosures. The Little Crowned Pigeon (Microgoura meeki) from
the Solomon Islands, if ever imported, from its much smaller dimen-
sions would make a very attractive and more easily accommodated
species in our aviaries.
The Crowned Pigeon (Gout a cristata) which has priority over the
generally used name coronata, is a magnificent bird over 2J ft. in length.
It spends most of its time on the ground in search of food ; its crop
has been found full of small berries. It seems to be remarkably tame
or stupid, so that it may easily be approached within gun-shot.
The nest is placed in a tree. It lays one white egg as big as a large hen's
egg. It has frequently been bred in confinement. General colour
bluish-slate-grey, darker on wings and tail, the latter with apical

pale grey band ; a black band from the lores to postocnlar region,
broader where it surrounds the eye ; a broad band across the back
and the tips of the upper wing-coverts dark chestnut; wing-speculum
formed by the bases of the central wing-coverts white ; the bright red
iris is a very beautiful feature. Habitat: North West New Guinea and
Western Islands. Sclater's Crowned Pigeon (G. c. sclateri) was
frequently met with by the British Ornithologists' Union Expedition
in Dutch New Guinea. On the canoe journeys up the river, parties of
two or three were seen in the early mornings searching for aquatic
life along the muddy banks. When disturbed they did not immediately
take flight, but with raised wings pirouetted around for a few seconds
and then flew to the nearest high tree. They were foolishly tame and
would allow several shots to be fired at them before reluctantly taking
flight. When seen crossing rivers the flight was strong, straight and
heavy. The remains of small crabs were found in their stomachs.
Has anyone ever tried these birds with shrimps in captivity ? This
Crowned Pigeon used to be very rarely imported. The first specimen
was exhibited in London in 1903, but quite lately a large number have
been brought over so that this form should be bred shortly. Differs
from typical cristata by having the back blue-grey and the lower fore-
neck and upper breast purple-chestnut. Habitat: Central and South
New Guinea. Scheepmaker's Crowned Pigeon (G. c. scheepmakeri ),
the bird known as albertisii, was formerly considered to differ from
scheepmakeri on account of its paler purple-chestnut and more extended
colouring of the flanks and larger and whitish-grey wing-speculum
as well as the paler tipped crest, the fact apparently being that the
type of scheepmakeri is probably an abnormally dark bird, but as this is
the older name it must be used for this form. It has been imported to
France, but does not seem to have reached England. Differs from
sclateri by having the smaller wing-coverts greyish-blue instead of
chestnut, the wing-speculum is whitish-grey instead of pure white,
and the tips of the crest feathers are paler grey. Habitat: South-East
New Guinea. The birds found in Waigou, Mysol and Batanta resemble
typical cristata but are smaller ; they are called G. c. minor.
The Victoria Crowned Pigeon (G. victoria) is even handsomer than
the common species, as the beautiful feathers of the crest are spatulated

at the tip, each spatula being edged with white. It is a freely imported
species and hybrids have been produced between it and cristata ; in
general appearance it resembles scheepmaJceri, but the breast is rather
a darker shade of purple-chestnut and the wing-speculum is bluish-
grey. Habitat: Jobi and Mysori Islands also Geelvink Bay, North-West
New Guinea. Beccari's Crowned Pigeon (G. v. beccarii) from
Northern New Guinea is larger and stronger with the spatula of the
crest feathers sometimes 40 mm. broad, and the bird from Huon Gulf
( G . v. huonensis) is again still larger and bluer above. Habitat : North-
East New Guinea.
The last family to be dealt with consists of the Little Dodos or
Didunculidce, perhaps the most interesting of the whole order on account
of its kinship to the Dodo. Characterized by its thick hooked bill,
the lower mandible serrated near the tip which is truncated, the nostrils
oblique and the front of the tarsus very imperfectly sealed. The family
contains but a single species. In captivity it would probably be most
suitably fed upon banana, potato, apples, etc., it will also, however,
eat bread, almonds, hemp and other seeds.
The Tooth-billed Pigeon ( Didunculus strigirostris) . The habits
of this most interesting bird seem to have undergone a change in recent
years. Formerly it was a ground bird, living, feeding and even nesting
on or near the earth, with the result that it was nearly exterminated
by wild cats, etc., and the eggs and young were an easy prey to rats,
but now the birds almost invariably roost upon the high branches of
trees, and the nest appears to be generally situated in the fork of a tree.
It is, however, very doubtful if even this will save the species from the
fate of its larger and better known relative. It feeds on plantains,
yams and other fruits and berries. It is exceedingly shy and timid,
its flight is powerful but very noisy. Only a few specimens have been
imported and it has always ranked as one of the rarest of the Pigeons
in confinement where it has laid eggs. Head, neck, mantle and upper
breast metallic blackish-green ; lower breast and abdomen brownish-
black; rest of plumage chestnut, quills browner, sexes alike. The young
are brown with crescentic rufous bands on feathers of upper parts
and breast. In the adult the large bill is orange, naked orbital skin
fleshy-red ; feet ochraceous-red ; iris brown. Habitat: Upolu, Savai
and Tutuila, Samoan Islands.

This is the fourth year of my experiments in trying to breed the
yellow and blue varieties of the Alexandrine (Palceornis nepalensis)
and Ring-necked (P. torquata) Parrakeets. The first two years, when
I mated the blue cock Alexandrine to a lutino hen, the eggs were all
infertile. Last year the hen lutino mated to a green cock had two
young. Both of these are green. A green hen, mated to the blue
cock Alexandrine, last year only got as far as eggs, which were again
clear. This year the lutino hen mated to the same green cock as last
year had two young, as early as February. These were found frozen
to death in the nest during the bitterly cold weather we then
experienced. However, she went to nest again, and has reared three
young, which are all green. To my great surprise the blue cock
Alexandrine, with his mate of last year, reared four fine healthy young
ones for the first time. These four birds are also all green. Practically
all the young left the nest about the first week of June and they do
look a fine lot. Now that I have got blue-bred and lutino-bred young,
I hope, with luck and a lot of patience, to be successful in breeding
a blue and a yellow Alexandrine. Both these pairs of Alexandrines
ure wonderful parents and the devotion they show towards their
young is extraordinary. They never objected to my visiting the aviary
but would always fly into the nest-box on my approach and sit on the
young to protect them. I was not so lucky with the Ring-necks, but
this is the first year I have had pairs in breeding condition and I hope
for success next year. I had three breeding pairs of these, and all
went to nest and had fertile eggs. One pair had two young, and after
they were four days old I found them both dead in the nest. Their
crops were full of food, but I think the hen bird did not brood them one
night, with fatal results. The other two pairs had four and three
eggs respectively, but both lots incubated the eggs for a fortnight and
then left them. They were all fertile and the chicks perfectly formed.
I am hoping to have some yellow Ring-necked young next year from
*a pair of really good lutinos. In this pair both the cock and hen are

perfect yellow birds with pink eyes and should produce some yellow
young. My good old pair of Barrabands had six young this year.
One died, but the rest are all flourishing and will soon leave the nest.
These birds have reared young every year for the last four years,
and seem to have an extra one every year. My Crimson-wings, Layards,
and Derbyans have not attempted to nest, but I hope they will do so
next year.

THE BLACK-THROATED CROW-TIT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984242571428572" page_id="56215900"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
In a small consignment of birds recently received from Shanghai
were eight specimens of this remarkable little bird, generally known
as the Black-throated or Grey-headed Crow-Tit or Parrot Bill, and
scientifically as Psittiparus, Paradoxornis or Scceorhynchus gularis .
It inhabits the Eastern Himalayas extending as far as Fokien in China.
The top of the head and nape are grey, sides of face and under
parts white ; brow-stripe black ; ear-coverts pale grey ; the upper
parts of the plumage rufous-brown. The bill is almost Parrot-like, and
when handled the bite is quite as severe as that of a small Parrot. In
size this species about equals a House Sparrow and the sexes are alike.
This is a very active little bird, Tit-like in its movements, but with
weak powers of flight. It has the appearance of being a hardy species
and it is to be hoped it may consent to breed in captivity. It is said to
construct an open nest composed of shreds of grass and of bamboo
leaves and stems and to lay three to four eggs to a clutch.
The food of the Crow-Tits consists of insects and also seeds of all
kinds.
Crow-Tits are an entirely new group to aviculture and at present
we know very little about them, but they have the appearance of very
attractive birds, though they are proving destructive to vegetation.

THE BIRDS OF AYRSHIRE 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996342857142857" page_id="56215903"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
The county of Ayrshire, situated on the south-west of Scotland,
contains some of the finest and most varied scenery in the British
Islands, fertile valleys covered with rich crops, wild moorlands covered
with purple heather, rugged mountains, glens, rivers, and gorges, lochs
and magnificent stretches of woodland. The shores are varied also,
with sandy stretches and rocky beaches surmounted by rugged cliffs,
while off the coast, though still within the boundaries of the county,
is that magnificent haunt of sea birds, the rock Ailsa Craig.
With such varied conditions the avifauna is naturally rich, and
it was fitting that a reliable book on the birds of that county should be
produced. This has now appeared and is all that such a work
should be, an accurate record of the birds of the county, well printed
and beautifully illustrated with photographs and containing a good
map. Moreover, it contains one very charming coloured plate of the
Greenland Falcon.
The possession of the splendid rock, Ailsa Craig, gives special
interest to the avifauna of Ayrshire, for it is one of the most wonderful
homes of sea-birds in the British Islands. The author estimates that
during the breeding season there are no less than 14,000 Gannets on
the rock, besides other interesting species such as Ravens and
Peregrines.

Not only does the Report provide delightful reading for all who
are interested in one of the finest of our native birds, but it shows
evidence of a vast amount of labour most carefully performed. Never
before has such an exhaustive story of the Heron been written. One
is pleased to learn that in these days when so many fine species have
gone, the Heron is found as a breeding species in every part of England
and Wales, and that, in spite of its fondness for fish, the majority of
colonies are actively protected during the breeding season by the owners
of the land upon which they are situated. The time has long since
passed when Herons were eaten--" skinned, stuffed, and roasted like
hare, with strawberries and cream to follow." May they long survive
in their present numbers to add to the beauty and interest of our
country.

Sir, --Having read Mr. Appleby's notes in last month's Magazine,
I feel sure that he has given many the lead, that only keep the more
common of the foreigners through lack of space or purse, to record
their successes and failures.
If through expense one is unable to keep the rarer birds, a great
deal of enjoyment is obtained by reading results of those who do.
Like Mr. Appleby, my birds are the general run of cheap foreigners
one can readily buy at almost any time of the year, but I think that
I must have had a little more luck than he has.
My first birds were Zebra Finches, which made a nest in a small
box under a thatched roof in large open flight. Every bird in this
aviary must have been aware of his attention to duty. When they

alighted anywhere near, off went his steam kettle hiss, and having got
rid of them for a while, he would then sound his penny trumpet song.
A more cheeky little devil I have never seen. Not content with
his own domestic duties, he even tried to help a pair of Long-tailed
Grass Finches built their nest.
Three nests of young, six in nest, I had from this pair, and while
the parent birds were feeding them I supplied mealworms, ants' eggs,
and as many flies as I could gather ; these were given to the young
as soon as the parents were supplied with them. All young reached
adult age. Now this year the Cock Zebra has succeeded in mating up
to the hen Long-tailed Grass Finch, despite the cock Grass Finch
protesting. Already they have eggs, but now I find the hen Grass
Finch has gone back to her rightful mate, so, nothing daunted, the
cock Zebra Finch is doing his best to make something of the results
by sitting hard himself.
The hen Zebra Finch is now playing up to her lawful mate, so this
domestic triangle should be interesting.
White Java Sparrows in the same aviary turned out two nests,
five in the first nest, four in the second. The first nest contained
three white and grey, two biscuit and grey ; second nest three white
and grey, one biscuit and grey; and all were reared.
I should like to mention that seldom do you get a pure white
youngster from pure white birds; they are generally, in their first
plumage, grey and white and biscuit and grey. After the first moult
the young grey and white become pure whites, like the parents, and
the biscuit-coloured ones become the ordinary grey Javas. When
feeding young I noticed the parents supplied as much young grass
as they could take. The grass in question was canary and rye grass
specially sown in the aviary for birds. When I cut some of this short,
the Javas were more eager to get at shoots close to the ground.
Diamond Doves wanted to nest in March, but I kept them back
till all the birds were let into the large open flight, which has plenty
of natural cover for birds. The first nest was bu ilt high up on the top
of a Hartz mountain cage; as it looked insecure, I started to build the
nest up a bit for them, which they tolerated, and the result was one
young cock Diamond Dove. This was the only young Diamond Dove

reared last year, but the year before I had two nests, two young in
each, and all reared.
Pekin Robins reared two nests, first nest in a privet bush, four
healthy young Robins reared, two cocks two hens.
Owing to its raining very heavily at the time they had young,
I put sacking over that part of the flight as the privet bush was in an
exposed position. A second nest in a box bush resulted in three
youngsters, two hens and one cock; both nests reared.
When the young appeared the parents were given mealworms, but
readily left them alone when I supplied gentles and wasp-grubs, the
latter they seemed to prefer to ail the other live food ; also ants' eggs
and spiders were provided. The young of the first nest helped the
parents to feed the young of the second nest as soon as they spotted
the parents doing so. One young cock of the first nest was feeding
the young of the second so well that I had to catch him up as he was
starving himself.
Pairs that had eggs which were not hatched were as follows : Long-
tailed Grass Finches, Avadavates, Orange-breasted Waxbills, and
Black-headed Nuns. How many the Pekin Robins accounted for I
am unable to say.
I found that when a good egg-food or hard-boiled yolk of egg
was given to the Pekins they did not trouble so much about the eggs
of other birds. One hen Pink-cheek Waxbill which I have had three
and a half years, and one Orange-cheek Waxbill cock three and a half
years, mated last year and again this. Last year they had eggs, but
nothing came of them. This year they are trying again, but I do not
think the result will live up to expectations.
Birds breeding this year in the same aviary are the two Waxbills
mentioned, Diamond Doves, Fawn and White Bengalese, White Javas,
Cutthroats, Zebra Finches, and Long-tailed Grass Finches, a bit of a
triangle previously mentioned, Orange-breasted Waxbills, Avadavats,
Goldfinches, Bullfinches, Siskins, Linnets.
I should have mentioned that a pair of Indigo Finches reared five
young to twelve days old behind a creeper-clad post. Thinking that
the hen was missing, not having seen her for some time, I felt in the
shrubbery, and found her sitting on a nest, but my inquisitiveness

was dearly paid for, as shortly after she deserted the nest and all
the young died.
This aviary in which I have had breeding results has a sheltered
part, eight feet long, four feet wide, seven feet high, half of which is
enclosed entirely, with a large window for light in front, all seed-hoppers
and drinking fountains being in this enclosed part. The birds have
access to the other half through a cut-away portion in the centre
partition.
During winter months one of Thomas' safelights provides warmth
for those that need it. The other half is covered all but in front, which
has open wire with glass half-way up to prevent mice from entering.
The British birds previously mentioned generally keep in the
enclosed half without heat; they only pay this part a visit when feed-
ing, as no seed, apart from millet sprays, is provided outside this
section.
Attached to this shelter is an open flight 30 feet long, 12 feet wide,
and 14 feet high, well planted with shrubs, and seed is sown according
to the birds kept, so that in due course they get their natural food.
On my walks, when I can spare time from my work, I always return
with seeding grass when obtainable, for the Budgerigars, of course in
their own aviaries. Also all forms of seed and plants which are in
season fit for my stock. This adds great interest to a walk, and you
find that you can before long, rub along as a good amateur botanist.
During the winter months I grow seed in boxes, and when about
one inch high give this to the birds. It proves a good titbit and seems
to answer well until Spring arrives.
Although I keep a medicine outfit for them, it is seldom used.
By careful observation one is able to note a sick bird, and cage it up
for a time, giving slightly different food if necessary, quietness, and
warmth, and it is soon fit as a rule.
If birds kept in a general aviary have similar feeding habits, I don't
think one need worry about over-feeding, especially if the flight is
large anough for exercise.
Trials and tribulations I have had, and get at times, but each test
one gets brings further knowledge along with it. All through last
winter I had no losses amongst my birds. W. H. Potter.

CAROLINA AND MANDARIN DUCKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998552107142857" page_id="56215910"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I read with interest the remarks by the Editor on the Carolina
and Mandarin Ducks naturalized in and about the Berlin Zoological
Gardens. As to the superseding of the Mandarin over the Carolina
as an indigeneous species, there is a point apart from climatic conditions
and an important one, i.e. " new blood In the case of the Mandarin,
new or wild caught birds are always being imported into this country.
The males, being paired with our hand-reared females, gives stamina,
whereas few, if any, Carolina, that is wild caught birds, are imported.
Here, certainly, where we rear a good number of both species, the
Mandarin is far the easier to rear in the young stage, but the Carolina
is as hardy, if not hardier, when past the difficult period--the first three
weeks. The climatic difficulty with Carolina, we find, is that the young
fret and do not feed well unless allowed access to water, be it ever so
small a puddle ; and this is fatal to them in cold or very wet weather.
In fine and sunny weather they do well.
As to straying I have had little experience of full-winged birds,
but one pair we did have full-winged remained and nested about the
place for a number of years. I think it is probable the birds would not
stray if they could find the quarters they want, or rather that suited
them--wooded ponds and streams with old dead and hollow trees for
nesting in. While writing about Carolina it is, I think, of some interest
to record that we had one nest in 1927, two in 1928, and three this
year of Carolina on the ground, like any other surface-feeding Duck.
Also this year a Mandarin nested and sat in a bunch of thick grass,
making a nest in the fashion of a Teal. Also that young have just
been hatched from an adult Blue Snow Goose, and a one-year-old &lt;J ;
incubation period 25 days.

2, 4, 3, 3. A Crimson-wing has laid 7, 4, 2, 3, 3. Occasionally, also,
a hen will, after a number of years, lay twice in a season and not do
so again for many years more. This happened in the case of a lutino
Ring-neck.
The date on which a breeding hen lays is also very variable, but this
may be due to the weather.

We learn from the Adelaide Advertiser of 10th April that the Minister
of Customs, Mr. Gullett, when at Islington, England, many years ago,
saw a number of Australian Finches, which had been exported from
Australia for sale to fanciers, shivering in the cold and in such a neglected
state that he formed a resolve that whenever the opportunity presented
itself he would stop this trade in Australian birds. Mr. Gullett has now
attained his object, and announces that in future no permits will be
issued for the export of birds for trade purposes.
Mr. Gullett has acted as every true lover of birds and of humanity
would have done had the opportunity occurred, for the manner in
which Australian Finches have been imported and confined in dealers'

shops in years gone by was nothing short of scandalous, and in putting
a stop to it the Minister of Customs has acted in the best interest of
his country and of its avifauna.
Mr. Gullett added, if the report is correct, " There will be no restric-
tions, however, on birds taken by sailors and passengers as pets or,
in the case of exports, in the course of exchange between zoos." It
is to be hoped that the authorities will also see their way to allow
private aviculturists in Australia to make exchanges of birds bred in
their aviaries with their fellow aviculturists in other countries.
There can be no doubt whatever that aviculturists as a whole are
a more humane body than those who collect birds purely as museum
specimens. They keep birds because they love them and they wish to
study their habits. Aviculture has certainly added much to our
knowledge of the life habits of birds and increased enormously
the interest taken in bird life, and while we must all heartily approve
of the prohibition that has been placed on the wanton cruelty that has
occurred in the past, we do hope that the authorities will not be so
dogmatic as to place any restriction upon the exchange of birds by true
aviculturists with their fellow aviculturists overseas.
The Avicultural Society of America has for some time past used
the columns of The Pet Dealer for the publication of its transactions,
but since the commencement of the present year it has issued a separate
journal. By a regrettable oversight the first two numbers appeared
under the title of The Avicultural Magazine, a title that was bound to
lead to considerable confusion, seeing that another journal of that
name had been in existence for more than thirty years. On this
discrepancy being pointed out, however, the name was changed to
that of Aviculture, by which title the journal will in future be known.

On his return from a recent collecting expedition Mr. Walter
Goodfellow brought home a single specimen of this striking
species, and Mr. Spedan Lewis very generously presented it to the
Zoological Society. It is the first of its kind to be exhibited in the
Zoological Gardens, and apparently the first imported to England,
though the species has been imported into France.
This is the only species of its genus, and inhabits the mountain
regions of Perak in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. It is said to be
not uncommon where conditions are favourable to it, occurring in
parties of five or six individuals, climbing about the trunks and branches
of the forest trees, and feeding upon fruits, berries, and insects.
The specimen at the Zoological Gardens, of which a coloured plate
appears herewith, is very tame and a most attractive bird.

in a basket inside the aviary shelter, using dried leaves, grass, and moss.
The nest was a very deep one and almost dome-shaped. This year
they built a similar nest in the same basket, and at the beginning of
May I found the hen sitting on three eggs. One young was seen
just hatching on the 13th May, and later on there were three young
in the nest. Only one lived, to leave the nest on the 8th June. He
started feeding himself on the 14th, but was weak in his flight and did
not fly up to perch till the 24th, by which time he had grown into a
fine healthy bird. The young one was reared on insectivorous food,
mealworms, gentles, ants' eggs, and grasshoppers, and both the parents
were most attentive to its wants and took good care of it. The young
bird's colouring is a good deal duller than that of the adult birds,
with grey on the top of the head and black under the eyes. The eggs
were about the size of a Blackbird's eggs, pale blue with a few red and
brown spots. As I write, on the 4th July, the bird is quite strong
and flies about everywhere. As it has taken me nearly .three years to
rear this bird, I am more than delighted with the success and think
it is the first of this species to be bred in captivity.

By Paul F. Stillman
Having been a member of the Avicultural Society for some few
years I have wanted to tell my fellow members some of my experiences,
in the hope that it may be of interest to them, as, judging from the
articles in our Magazine, and in the volume called Aviculture, which
I recently had the pleasure of reading, my experiences seem to differ
in many particulars from those of fellow members in England. Here,
where we are located, is what is termed the Middle Atlantic States,
and if there is any more abominable climate in the world, I should
like to find it. According to the calendar we have four seasons, but
according to conditions I think they must be jungled into one as, not
infrequently, we have winter when the calendar shows we are having
summer, and the others seem to be the same. It is, therefore, not easy

to know how to provide for one's pets, particularly all the " tropicals ",
which are my special hobby.
I notice, in some articles, that some of our members have indicated
that some of the Tanagers, such as the Banana Quit, are delicate.
I have kept these birds, and a host of others, and have had them
repeatedly in a temperature of 20 above zero, and never were birds
in better condition. Now perhaps a word about my feeding may be
of interest, because we all admit that food is the most important point
in the care of our pets. I have never used any of the professionally
prepared foods, but have experimented with various forms that I have
made myself, and the following is fed to all my soft-bill birds and they
seem to thrive on this mixture. We have in this country a preparation
known as " B-ose's ground meat and bone meal ", which, I am told,
consists of 67 per cent No. 1 hard wheat or better, and the balance
of ground meat and bone meal. To this I add hard-boiled eggs and
scalded ant eggs. These are rubbed together so that it is impossible
for a bird to obtain any one ingredient. The whole is placed in shallow
pans in which a ripe banana has been placed. Thrushes, Larks,
Tanagers, Babblers, Bulbuls, and a host of others thrive on this mixture.
I do not follow the course pursued by many others by changing my
food to suit the individual of different species that may inhabit my
aviaries. At the present time I have a Black-necked Minor who is
doing beautifully on this mixture. Mealworms are fed more as a treat
than as a regular part of the diet. At one time I had, I believe, the
honour of having in my possession the only Gold-headed Manakin,
but incidently, this Manakin was certainly beautiful but absolutely
dumb and uninteresting. Another point that I have found is that
birds can thrive on food that is not served freshly every day. My only
bad loss was in a flight I once had where the aviary was in a shady,
woody place that was damp. Under the conditions I faced at this
time I have had losses which I do not like to think of now.
At one time I was the proud possessor of an Abyssinian Splendid
Sunbird. I bought this living jewel in one of the coldest spells we had
in a cold January. At the time of purchase the few feathers--which
were so few you could count them--were plastered to his naked body,
the importer having been feeding principally on honey. There was

a question in my mind whether to risk a one-hour journey to my home,
or to leave him in a warm store, but I decided the risk of remaining was
the greater. As soon as we reached home a Majestic Electric Heater was
turned on his box cage at a distance of 1 foot, and a tepid bath was
supplied him. The intense pleasure of this combination to this little
jewel was absolutely indescribable. Meantime proper food was
prepared, and then he really enjoyed life and started to tell everyone
within hearing of the intense pleasure that life contained at least for
him. For one solid month this heater was kept in operation day and
night, at the end of which time the bird was really in good shape.
At the time of purchase there were none of the orange breast-feathers
visible, and these did not appear until the first summer, and I judge
from this that he must have been a very young specimen. With
this bird, as with all others, I tried rough treatment once he was in
condition to find out if he really was a delicate bird. As an illustration
of what I mean by rough treatment. In the summer-time I would
mix up some 6 ounces of food, giving it to him when fresh, and giving
him sour food until it was used, of course all this under close observation.
At the time of purchase I was reliably informed that these birds
could stand 70* F., and that 75* F. was better, yet I know for a fact
that this bird stood at least 40* F. and perhaps even lower. He died
after some four and a half years in my possession, which apparently
is some record for this country, the others which arrived in the same
shipment lasting not over two years. I personally think that under
better conditions these birds should live at least eight to ten years,
but mine never had an opportunity of a flight, remaining always in
a box-pattern cage.
I realize that, in comparison with many fellow-members, my
experience is extremely limited, and the varieties that I have kept are
only nominal, but of all the tropical soft-bills that I have had I can-
not believe that any are delicate or really difficult to keep or cater to.
I have noticed also that while some well-known foreign varieties will
eat berries and certain fruits, mine have never touched anything but
banana, and I have never found any Shamas that would touch any
form of fruit or green food. Green food I do not use as regularly as
others, and never lettuce or cuttle-bone. Lettuce, even in minute

quantities, I consider far too laxative and without any real food value,
while banana and orange or spinach have actual food value. I have just
been reading a book by Mr. Finn and also one by Mr. Page, and I
notice that they both, as do many others, advocate cuttle-bone. I have
never yet discovered the reason for this with Canaries or any other
birds. I believe some claim it stops egg-binding in hens, but I prefer
to use for this purpose suet, or negger seed, and I have never had any
egg-binding, though I have never done any real raising as my facilities
have not been equal to this interesting part of our hobby. Cuttle-bone
is, as near as I can find out, only lime, and if a bird is receiving proper
food he will get this in his food. Of course birds like it because it is
salty, but so far as being beneficial I cannot find out where this benefit
comes from. It may seem presumptuous for me to differ from those
of far greater experience than my own, but I know in this country
that some of my friends who are in this hobby have losses far greater
than mine. And yet for several years my birds had far less care and
attention than I consider was required to keep birds in show condition,
and people who have seen them comment on the fact that they are in
show condition at all times.
At the present time I am looking forward with tremendous interest
to the next twelve months. My present plant is located within 150
feet of the Atlantic Ocean on the East, and a river about 300 feet West.
During the year that I have lived here we have had a mild winter,
but several bad storms from the north-east and north-west, and I
will be curious to see how my pets can stand the rigours of the damp
climate which naturally follows proximity to so much water. I
personally believe that with proper food it will have no effect, but it
may be necessary for me to modify the diet of both the hard- and soft-
bill birds which I may from time to time have.
I am always envious of our foreign members when I pick up the
advertisements of some of your importers and see listed birds whose
names I only know from books that seem fairly common in your
market. Our importers here, because of lack of real interest in this
fascinating hobby, bring in really only the more common varieties,
and the beautiful rare birds which sell in your markets at such surprising
figures are never seen even in public collections in this country. I do

hope that the time is not far distant when these conditions will improve
for the better, as I believe that aviculture is just in its infancy here,
and I look forward to seeing in the next few years a vast increase in
the number of those interested in this fascinating hobby.
I hope that these rambling notes may contain some information
that will be of interest.
THE TRUE PIGEONS OR COLUMBINE
By T. H. Newman
This subfamily embraces the typical Pigeons and although none of
its members can vie with the many-hued Treronidce in brilliancy of
colouration, all are fine handsome birds and some are among the most
beautiful of the whole order, being more terrestrial in habits than the
Fruit Pigeons. They have mostly longer legs and so seem better
proportioned., The skin of the front toes is not expanded on the sides.
They have twelve tail feathers. In the wild state the food consists
of grain and seeds, beech-nuts, acorns, berries, buds, and small wild
fruits, besides which a certain amount of animal food is taken in the
form of smooth caterpillars, various grubs, and earthworms. In
captivity a good mixture should be supplied of wheat and dari, with
a lesser quantity of hemp. The larger species can have a little small
maize, also white peas and " tick " beans as given to domestic Pigeons,
while the smaller birds will eat white millet and canary seed ; a little
rice is liked by some species, crushed biscuit is eaten, a dog-biscuit
ground very fine makes a change, chopped pea-nuts and green food
should be given, and a lump of rock salt. The seeds need not be given
separately, and if placed on a tray supported in the middle or suspended
from the roof, mice will not be able to eat much. Many birds will
scatter and waste much in trying to get at a particular kind of seed.
I used to use the round pots of glazed ware, supplied by Spratts : they
have a turned-in edge.
The large and unwieldy genus Columba , as given in the British
Museum Catalogue , vol. xxi, and in Sharpe's Hand-List , is obviously
composite in character and can conveniently be divided into sections

or subgenera. All are birds of considerable size and many are of great
beauty. In habits they widely differ, some being as arboreal as Fruit
Pigeons, others inhabit rocks, avoiding trees, and others again spend
much time on the ground. The following species seem to have been
kept in captivity.
The Grey or, as it would be better to call it, Silver Pigeon
(Columba ( Leucotoenia) argentina) is a very rare species. Two examples
were presented by the Prince of Wales to the London Zoological
Gardens in May, 1922, and, as far as I know, these are the only living
specimens to have been imported ; they seemed of sluggish disposition
and were always perched quietly in a bush whenever I saw them.
They strongly reminded one of soiled Nutmeg Pigeons (Myristicivora
bicolor), as they have nearly the same distribution of colours, the entire
bird being of a pale silvery-grey with quills and apical half of tail black.
Habitat, Borneo and Sumatra. The better known name of grisea
cannot be used for this bird on account of the prior Columba grisea,
Bonn. = Chcemepelia minuta.
The Snow Pigeon (C. (Lithoenas) leuconota) is one of the most
remarkably coloured birds in existence, looking like a domestic Pigeon
of the " German Toy " class. It is a rock-loving species, breeding
in the Himalayas in colonies, above 10,000 feet, but coming down to
the valleys in winter. Its note is a curious hiccough-like noise, it also
utters a kuck-kuck-kuck coo. Head slate-grey, wings greyish-brown
crossed by three brown bands, neck and under-surface white, tail
blackish-brown, crossed by a Y-shaped white band. Habitat, Yarkand,
Cashmere, through the Himalayas to Thibet. A coloured plate with
an account of its habits and breeding appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine, Vol. II (3), 1911.
The Bock Pigeon ( C . ( Lithoenas ) livid). This is the well-known
wild Pigeon of our rocky coasts and is, of course, the ancestor of all
our domestic birds. Nearly a dozen races are known, from the dark
canariensis from the Canary Islands to the pale, recently described
form, dakhlce, from the Lybian Desert. They only differ in the shade
of the grey of the plumage and in the white or grey rump. Habitat,
Europe, Asia, West Africa (with the Canary Islands), North Africa,
and coasts of the Red Sea.

The Stock Pigeon (C . ( Palumhcena) cenas) is another of onr familiar
wild birds, whose granting note can be heard wherever there are plenty
of old trees. It also nests in rabbit-holes. General colour leaden-grey,
with irregular black bars across the wings ; tail with broad apical
black band, throat and crop-region purple-vinous, back and sides of
neck metallic-green. Habitat, Europe, Central Asia, an allied form
being found in North India.
The White-collared Pigeon (C. ( Tcenioenas) albitorques). A
striking bird of unique appearance ; general colour bluish slate with
irregular black bars across the wing, the feathers of the neck lanceolate
and glossed with green, a white collar on the nape broadest at the back.
Habitat, Abyssinia and Shoa.
The Triangular-spotted Pigeon ( C . (Dialiptila) guinea). This
strikingly handsome species is another rock lover with habits very
similar to those of our Rock Pigeon. I believe this would be a good
bird to let fly at large, as it would probably behave very like a domestic
Pigeon. It has a large bare red space round the eye and the feathers
of the neck are stiff and bifid and stand out like a frill when the bird
is uttering its bark-like note. Head, quills, and breast grey, also the
rump ; back and wings chestnut with triangular white spots. I reared
a young bird of the Southern form, phceonota , some years ago ; they
differ from typical guinea in the darker shade of the grey parts. Habitat,
throughout the greater part of the Ethiopian region, but not in the
West African forest region.
&amp;apos; The Naked-eyed Pigeon (C. ( Crossophthalmus ) gymnophthalmos) is
another species with bare skin round the eye, but as it is of a vinous-
grey colour only a little darker in shade than the feathers of the head,
it is not so conspicuous as in the last-named species. It has bred
freely at the London Zoo. Head, neck, and breast rosy-vinous ; wings
pale brown, anterior wing-coverts broadly edged with white which
forms a broad white band, so that the bird is known as " Ala blanca "
in its native country. Habitat, Islands of Aruba, Curacao, Bonaire,
and Margarita off the north coast of Venezuela.
The Picazuro Pigeon (C. (Picazurus) picazuro). This bird is
rather like a dull-coloured Wood Pigeon with a vinous head. It does
well in captivity and can frequently be seen at the Zoo. It feeds in

v the maize fields and nests in the hot low-lying woodlands. Head
and underparts rich vinous, hind neck grey with each feather with a
narrow band of grey and black, wings sooty-brown with outer and
greater coverts edged with white. Habitat, Central and South Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.
The Spot-winged Pigeon ( C . ( Noticenas ) maculosa). This is
another well-known South American species which has done well and
bred freely at the London Zoo. Its note resembles that of our Wood
Pigeon, consisting of three notes --cooo-Jco-coq-coo. Head and under
surface deep grey with strong vinaceous tinge, mantle, scapulars, and
upper wing-coverts sooty-brown with whitish triangular tips. Habitat,
Peru to Argentina.
The Olive Pigeon (C. ( Stictoenas) arquatrix). The yellow orbital
ring, bill, and feet of this splendid bird at once catch the eye ; it is
very largely a fruit-eater, being especially fond of the wild olives : hence
its name. They breed in pairs, usually in wooded mountain ravines.
Head dark vinous-purple, occiput and nape silvery-grey (a form from
Belgian Congo has the nape pure white) ; back, scapulars, and lower
breast deep purple-chestnut spotted with white at the tips of the
feathers, rump and outer edge of wings grey. Habitat, Abyssinia
through East Africa and Uganda to Angola and South Africa.
The White-crowned Pigeon ( C . ( Patagicenas) leucocephala ). This
is the most sombre-coloured member of the whole genus, but is neverthe-
less a smart looking bird. It is of gregarious habits, considerable
numbers nesting in the same tree. It feeds largely on berries. General
plumage dark leaden-grey, paler below ; crown pure white, duller in
the female ; nape and sides of neck glossy green, each feather edged
with velvet-black which form black diagonal lines on the neck.
I noticed that the young on leaving the nest show little trace of the
white crown. Habitat, West Indies and southern North America.
The Porto Rico Pigeon (C. (Patagioenas) squamosa). This is a
near ally to the last-mentioned species. It is said to be of very arboreal
habits and to feed on berries. General colour dark plumbeous ; head,
neck, and crop rich vinous, nape and a cape extending upon the sides
of the neck metallic-violet, each feather bordered with velvety maroon.
Habitat, many of the West Indian Islands but not Jamaica or the
Bahamas.

The Scallop-necked Pigeon (G. (Lepidoenas) speciosa). A glance
at the coloured plate accompanying this article will show what a very
fine species this is. Unfortunately, only few examples seem to
have been imported, though it is said to be abundant in its native
forests. Head and wings maroon with purple tinge, feathers round
neck with white spots and regularly margined with metallic-green and
amethystine reflections producing a scaly appearance. Habitat,
East Mexico, through. Central America to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Guiana, and Brazil.
The Plain Pigeon (C . ( Chloroenas) inornata). Though very
abundant in Haiti and Jamaica it has rarely been imported alive.
It forms one of a group of five closely allied species of which the Rufous
Pigeon is the best known in captivity. Head, neck, and underparts
vinous-purple ; mantle and wings brown-grey, median wing-coverts
tinged with chestnut; anterior upper and greater wing-coverts con-
spicuously edged with white, bill black. Habitat, typically Cuba and
Haiti; other races from Jamaica, Porto Rico, and the Isle
of Pines.
The Red-billed Pigeon (C . ( Chloroenas ) flavirostris) has also been
imported. It inhabits forest districts, always perching on the highest
trees. In the mornings it resorts to the sand-bars in the river for
drinking and bathing. It feeds on acorns when in season. In summer
it migrates north to within the borders of the United States, where it
breeds abundantly : only one egg is laid, but the birds are said to breed
several times in a season. General appearance like inornata, but the
grey wing-coverts are only narrowly edged with whitish and the bill
is rosy red at the base, whitish at the tip, a red ring round the eye.
Habitat, North Mexico, Rio Grande Valley in Texas to Honduras ;
other races from Nicaragua and Costa Rica and from Tres Marias
Islands.
The Rufous Pigeon (0. ( Chloroenas ) rufina). The darkest and
most richly coloured member of this group, distinguished by the
absence of lighter margins to the wing-coverts. It has a superficial
resemblance to the Madagascar Turtle Dove, picturata. It was first
bred in this country by the late Miss Alderson, of Worksop, only one
egg being laid at a sitting. Forehead, neck, breast, back, scapulars,

and median upper wing-coverts chestnut-purple tinged with
amethystine ; nape bronze-green, cheeks, lower back, upper and lower
tail-coverts grey, tail brown-grey. Habitat, about five races dis-
tinguished ; typically from French Guiana ; range of species from
Brazil north through Guiana, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama to South-
East Mexico.
The Ring-tailed Pigeon (C. (Chlorcenas) caribcea). This fine
bird is very arboreal and feeds almost entirely on fruits and berries.
Though difficult to obtain it has been exhibited at the London Zoo-
logical Gardens on several occasions. Upper surface grey, the taii
crossed in the middle by a black band, hind neck metallic-green shot
with purple, head, sides of neck, and under surface vinous, fading to
greyish-white on the under tail-coverts ; bill black, iris beautiful deep
vermilion. Habitat, Jamaica and perhaps Porto Rico.
The Band-tailed Pigeon (C. (Chloroenas) fasciata) is a very
attractive species, well known in Canada and the Western States,
where it feeds in flocks on grain and peas. It has seldom been imported.
I once had two young birds which did not show the white neck band of
the adult. They were deposited at the Zoo. Head, sides of neck,
throat and breast purplish-violet fading to white on the under tail-
coverts ; nape golden-green, separated from the purplish head by a
conspicuous narrow white half-collar ; back, wings, and tail brownish-
grey, the latter crossed by a narrow black band in the middle ; bill
black at the tip with the base and also the feet yellow. Habitat,
Western North America from Canada to Nicaragua in Central America ;
a form from Lower California lacks the black tail-band.
The White-naped Pigeon (C . ( Chloroenas ) albilinea) is nearly
related to the Band-tail, from which it chiefly differs in being much
darker. It feeds on seeds and fruits, perching in company to rest in
dry trees during the midday heat. Crown of head and under-surface
purplish-vinous, throat and under tail-coverts lead-grey, nape dark
metallic golden green with white half-collar above, back and wings
slate-colour with olive-green gloss, tail grey with a blackish band
across the middle ; bill and feet yellow. Habitat, the north-eastern
part of South America. A race with paler grey underparts inhabits
Costa Rica to Panama.

T. H. Newman--The True Pigeons or Columbince
The Araucanian or Chilian Pigeon ( C . ( Chlorcenas ) araucana).
This very handsome bird is the richest coloured member of the little
group of Pigeons with white neck-collars. It is very abundant in
Chile, appearing in flocks during the cold season. The nest resembles
that of our Wood Pigeon. The cooing is said to be a deep booming
sound. It is a pity that it seems to have been so rarely imported.
Head, throat, back, scapulars, breast, and abdomen chestnut-vinous
with amethystine tinge on the breast; scale-like feathers of hind neck
metallic bronze-green, a whitish band on the nape, wing-coverts greyish-
brown, changing into lighter grey on the outer and greater ones ;
quills brown-black with narrow whitish edges, lower back and tail grey
with a subterminal black band, bill black, feet rose red. Habitat, Chile.
The Canarian Pigeon ( C . (Trocaza) junonice). The Canary Islands
and Madeira are inhabited by three closely allied Wood Pigeons very
like small editions of our common species, but lacking the white patches
on neck and wing, and only one egg is laid at a sitting. About forty
years ago Mr. Meade-Waldo found the present bird fairly abundant
in Gomera on the steep slopes of the Cordillera, covered with thick
heath and laurel-scrub. He noted the peculiar soft flopping flight and
the conspicuous light-tipped tails making them resemble gigantic
Turtle Doves when flying. They spent much time on the ground.
Mr. St. Quintin reared two or three in 1898. General colour grey, the
head and neck glossed with green, the outer tail feathers paler at the
tips, breast and abdomen vinous-chestnut. Habitat, Palma and
Gomera (Canary Islands). The name laurivora is merely a substitute
for C. (T.) trocaz. La Palma and Gomera were formerly called Junonia
Major and Minor.
Bolle's Pigeon ( C . ( Trocaza) bollii). Formerly very abundant
in the laurel forests of the Canary Islands, but since the laurels have
been cut down both it and the Canarian Pigeon have become very
scarce, so that if it has not already taken place the final disappearance
of these two fine birds seems imminent. Both these species inhabit
Gomera and Palma, but Bolle's Pigeon prefers the higher mountain
country. It bred in the London Zoo in 1888. General colour slate-
blue, hind, neck, and upper mantle glossed with green and purple ;
a patch on sides of neck glossed with coppery-chestnut, breast vinous-

chestnut changing to grey on the abdomen, tail slaty-black crossed
by a broad sub-terminal dark grey band. Habitat, Teneriffe, Gomera
and Palma (Canary Islands).
The Madeiran Pigeon (C. ( Trocaza) trocaz). Frequents the high
laurel forests, feeding on the fruit of the bay and till trees, for which
they search among the dead leaves on the ground. Ogilvie-Grant
found it still fairly common in the north of the Island in 1890. Slate-
blue, rather paler on head, fore-neck, lower back, rump, and under-
surface ; hind neck glossed with green, feathers on sides of neck scale-
like and tipped with silvery-grey, breast vinous-chestnut, tail leaden-
grey, crossed beyond the middle by a broad lighter grey band. Habitat,
Madeira.
The Wood Pigeon (C . palumbus ). This all too well-known bird
is the type of the genus Columba , and is thus pre-eminently the typical
Pigeon. When reared from the nest it will become extraordinarily
tame. A cock bird I once had would always come and coo to one when
spoken to, bowing and raising the tail. It was interesting to watch
the iris contract with each bow. He would answer even when spoken
to at night. I tried to mate him without success to a hen domestic
Pigeon. Many hens seemed quite willing, but he was very rough with
them. Of course, this cross has been obtained.. A description is
needless. Habitat, Europe and West Asia ; allied races from North-
West Africa, Madeira, and the Azores, while in Turkestan and North-
West India a form occurs with cream-coloured neck patches.
None of the four members of the section Alsocomus seem to have been
imported alive. Three of these are grey birds with handsomely spotted
neck bands, while the fourth (C. (A.) puniceus) is chestnut with a pale
grey crown. They inhabit India, Ceylon, and Indo-China.
We now come to the Metallic Pigeons comprising the section
Janihcenas. They are birds mostly slaty-grey in colour but with the
whole of the plumage, except the quills and tail, glossed with bright
metallic colours which vary according to the angle of light. An almost
black looking bird by a sudden turn will show glittering green or from
another view appear bright rosy purple or fiery orange, making them
among the most beautiful of birds and only rivalled or surpassed by
the Sun- and Humming-birds. About a dozen species are known,

T. H. Newman--The True Pigeons or Columbines
though there is some difference of opinion about some whether they
should be given full specific rank. It is much to be regretted that
only a small number of a very few of these splendid birds have ever
been brought over. In habits and appearance they closely resemble
the Fruit Pigeons of the genus Muscadivora , but have only twelve
rectrices like other typical Pigeons.
The Metallic Pigeon (C . (Janthcenas) metallica ) is one of the least
beautiful of this subgenus, but is nevertheless a very handsome Pigeon.
I have not been able to find any account of its habits. General plumage
slate-black, upper part of head, neck, and crop region metallic purple-
violet ; throat and cheeks slate-grey with slight purple edges to the
feathers of the latter ; rest of upper parts with metallic golden-green
edges. Habitat, Timor.
The White-throated Pigeon (C . (Janthcenas) halmaheira) is
perhaps the most beautiful of all the Pigeons and a most desirable
aviary bird in every way, gentle in disposition and very hardy, preferring
to sit in the open during rain and nesting even in the winter. I obtained
six birds in 1908 and reared several young ones, only one egg being
laid at a sitting. Every egg hatched produced a healthy youngster,
being fully reared in every case. Maize was their chief food. An
account of the nesting will be found in the Avicultural Magazine,
Vol. I (3), 1910. Crown of head and upper surface blackish-slate,
glossed with brilliant metallic-green or rosy-purple according to light;
cheeks and throat white, under-surface pale chestnut glossed with
purple changing to green, quills and tail slate-black, orbits and base
of bill red, terminal half of latter yellowish-white. Habitat, typically
Moluccas ; other races from Duke of York Island and New Guinea.
It is to this last form, known as C. (J.) h. rawlinsoni, to which my
birds belonged. The name albigularis cannot be used for this species
on account of a prior usage .
The Fijian White-throated Pigeon (C. ( Janthoenas) vitiensis ).
Dr. P. H. Bahr, writing in The Ibis for 1912, says of this Pigeon :
" It is still extremely common, very tame and confiding. It is partially
migratory and appears in great numbers round Suva in April and May."
It lives well in captivity, becoming very tame and docile. It has a loud
" coo " not unlike that of a Stock Pigeon. Very like the last described

species, but having the forehead distinctly grey ; the nnderparts
are darker, being rich vinous passing into grey on the under tail-coverts.
Habitat, Fiji Islands.
When so many of the Australian birds have been freely imported,
it is strange that the beautiful Australian White-headed Pigeon
(C. ( Leucomelcena ) norfolciensis) has never been seen alive here. Its
white head, neck, breast, and abdomen, and slate-black upper parts
glossed with green or purple and red and yellow bill make it most
attractive.
The Brown, Lanceolate-collared Comoro Pigeon ( C .
(Amauroenas) pollenii), with yellowish bill and feet, is another interesting
species yet to be imported.
The Vinaceous Pigeon ( C . ( (Enoenas) jplumbea). The members of
this, the last group of the genus Columba, are all American, ranging
from the Southern States of North America to as far south as Paraguay
in South America. They are all nearly uniform dull -brown, with more
or less metallic reflections. They are forest birds. Numerous races
belonging to some half-dozen species have been described, but only
one, the above-named, seems to have been brought over alive. It is
said to be strictly a Wood Pigeon and rarely leaves the shelter of the
woods and dense scrub. Its food consists of fruit. Head, neck, and
under-surface purplish-vinous, upper surface dark brown glossed with
olive, the feathers of the lower hind neck and mantle often have two
rosy spots on them. Habitat, South Brazil and Paraguay.
Mayer's Pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri). There seems to be something
fatal to Pigeons in the Island of Mauritius, for this lovely pink-breasted
bird seems now to have followed its more famous fellow islanders the
Dodo and the curious Hackled Pigeon ( Alectroenas nitidissima) to
extinction. This was brought about by the destruction of the forests
and the introduction of an Indian monkey, which destroyed the nests,
eggs, and young birds. Two birds were presented to the London Zoo
in 1906, and four more were deposited in June, 1907, quite possibly
the last of their race. Head, neck, mantle, and under surface pale
pink, paler on the head ; upper surface and wings brown, tail cinnamon,
bill rosy pink at the base, nearly white at the tip ; a ring round the
eye and feet red. Habitat, Mauritius.

T. H. Newman--The True Pigeons or Columbines
The Gaboon Bronze-naped Pigeon (Turturoena iriditorques). Very
little seems to have been recorded about the habits of the three or four
species of African Pigeons of this genus : they seem to be forest birds
feeding on fruits and berries and on certain insects. A single bird
of this species was presented to the Zoological Society of London by
Mr. T. R. Saunderson in June, 1928. Major H. J. Kelsell found
this fine Pigeon fairly common in the hill forests of Sierra Leone,
but owing to its living in the tops of tall trees, it is extremely difficult
to obtain specimens. Its call is unmistakable, being a very deep,
sonorous " coo-oo, coo-oo, coo-oo ", the second and third being in a
lower key. Male, entire head and upper neck lead-grey ; hind-part
of head and neck glossed with green, below which is a collar of coppery
feathers with amethystine reflections ; rest of upper parts slate-grey,
feathers of mantle edged with green; under-surface vinous more
chestnut on under tail-coverts. The female has little grey on the head
which is vinous like the upper breast, rest of under parts brown-grey.
Habitat, West Africa from Sierra Leone to Angola, east to the Ituri
district of the Belgian Congo.
The St. Thomas Bronze-naped or Malherbe's Pigeon (T.
malherbii). A hen bird of this species was exhibited in the London
Gardens in 1909. Upper parts and tail slate-black with metallic-green
lustre, forehead, throat, and under parts lead-grey ; neck metallic-
green with beautiful amethyst reflections, bill grey at base, yellowish at
tip ; feet pink, iris crimson. Habitat, Prince Island and St. Thomas
Island in the Gulf of Guinea.
The Long-tailed Pigeons or Cuckoo-doves (Macropygia) form
a well-marked genus, distinguished by their long tails, brown or chestnut
plumage, in many instances remarkably barred. They are of a tame
nature inhabiting open glades in dense forest. They spend much time
on the ground, only a few individuals being found together. They
feed on seeds and berries. Range, Oriental and Australian regions.
Some forty forms have been described, but these are probably
referable to about a dozen species, and only a very few have been
imported.
The Bar-tailed Cuckoo-dove ( Macropygia unchall). A few
examples of the typical race seem to have been exhibited at the London

Zoo, and Madame Lecallier bred it in 1926 and 1927. Little has been
recorded of its habits in a wild state, but Eobinson in his just published
The Birds of the Malay Peninsula , vol. ii, writes : " Decidedly rare in
Malaya, being found only on the higher parts ... on Cameron's High-
lands, at about 4,000 feet. It is met with in parties of three or four,
feeding on the ground amid tangled vegetation, usually in damp places.
When alarmed it takes to flight with a noisy clapping of the wings,
but soon settles again. The note is a very deep ' coo ', ending in
a curious kind of gurgle." It rarely lays more than one egg at a sitting.
Male, top and sides of head buffy-grey strongly shot with greenish
and amethystine reflections as are also the feathers on the nape, upper
surface blackish irregularly barred with dark chestnut rufous, tail
barred with black and dull rufous, the three outer pairs tipped with
greyish ; below, chin and throat vinaceous buff ; chest and breast
vinaceous barred with black and shot with amethystine reflections,
belly pale buff changing to pale cinnamon on the under tail-coverts.
The female has the head and under-surface thickly barred with
brownish-black. Habitat, typically Java, Sumatra, Malay Peninsula,
and probably Tenasserim. This form used to be called leptogrammica,
which is a later name for the Javan bird. The better known, larger,
and more finely barred race from India, M. u. tusalia, does not seem
to have been brought over. But the dark race from Hainan and Indo-
China, M. u. minor , was bred by Mr. Ezra in 1927 from birds brought
over by M. Delacour. Only one egg was laid at a time in captivity,
but nests containing two eggs were found in Annam, see Avicultural
Magazine for January, 1928, under Swinhoe's Pheasant-tailed Pigeon
(M. swinhoei).
Emilian Cuckoo Dove ( M . emiliana). An example of this Pigeon
was purchased by the London Zoological Society in 1866. According
to Whitehead this species nests in open localities in dead bracken
only a foot or two above the ground, its plumage assimilating perfectly
with the dead fern. Back and wings deep chestnut, faintly tinged with
purplish ; tail conspicuously rufouscent, a broad black belt across
the base of the three outer feathers ; head, neck, and under-surface
cinnamon-rufous, hind, neck and mantle with lilacine lustre. The
female has the mantle crossed by dusky-bordered cinnamon bars,

breast with broader dusky margins to the feathers. Habitat, Java,
Lombock, and North Borneo.
The Pheasant-tailed Cuckoo Dove (M. phasianella). Little
seems to have been recorded of the habits of this Pigeon since Gould
recorded that this fine bird shows itself to great advantage when it
rises from the ground to the trees, spreading out its broad tail at the
moment of alighting. It spends much time on the ground searching
for fallen seeds and berries. Only one egg is laid as a rule. General
colour chestnut-brown, hind neck glossed with metallic lilac shot with
green, a black band across the three outer pairs of tail feathers. Female
smaller and duller, lower hind neck and upper back with brown and
rufous bars. Habitat, Australia from Cape York to Victoria and South
Australia ; other sub-species ranging west to Sumatra and north to
the Philippines.
Dorey Cuckoo Dove (M. amboinensis doreya). This is one of
the numerous races of M. amboinensis , which ranges from the Moluccas,
New. Guinea, and Islands to New Ireland. Ogilvie-Grant, writing of
another of the forms in the Jubilee Supplement to The Ibis , 1915,
says : " It has a graceful flight and a sweet call of three or four coos.
It appears to spend much of its time feeding on the ground, but
when alarmed flies up into the trees." The Dorey Pigeon is above
chestnut-brown, nape and upper mantle bright metallic-green shot
with purple, tail cinnamon with subterminal blackish band on three
outer feathers, breast rich vinaceous shot with purple, each feather
with two blackish bars ; under tail-coverts chestnut. The female has
the crown brighter chestnut and the upper surface is brown with the
feathers more distinctly edged with chestnut. Habitat, New Guinea
and North-West Islands.
There are three other genera in this sub-family, all of great interest.
It is to be hoped that we shall see them alive some day. Turaccena,
with two slaty black species, one with a white forehead and cheeks.
Reinwardtcena also containing two species, both fine, long-tailed
birds with pale grey heads, necks, and underparts, one with chestnut

The next sub-family contained only a single species. The
Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes canadensis) has been extinct since
1914, when the last-known hen bird died in the Cincinnati Zoological
Park. The rapid destruction of this, at one time most abundant,
species, is one of the great tragedies of avian life in our own time,
which is all the more to be regretted as this very handsome Pigeon,
with its long pointed tail, thrived very well and bred freely in captivity,
so that if only a good stock had been preserved, it wrnuld have been
kept going for any length of time after the wild birds had been
exterminated. Male, head, back, wings, and tail bluish-grey ; median
wing-coverts with black velvety spots, outer tail feathers with a patch
of black and cinnamon at base of inner web, tips nearly white, throat
and breast reddish-cinnamon, fading to white on the under tail-coverts.
Female browner and wanting the cinnamon on the breast. Habitat,
east and central North America.

Sir,-- Having read Mr. Laidlay's letter re Carolina and Mandarin
Ducks, I think it may be of interest to record that our experience
of both species corresponds exactly with that reported by the Editor.
We have kept full-winged Carolina and Mandarin Ducks for a great
number of years. The former bred and did well with us for several
years and then died out. The Mandarins did not do well until given
full liberty, but since then they have thriven and a considerable number
have remained with us. I am not prepared to say that they do not
stray, as I have heard that many come into the hands of the local
taxidermists, but we get flocks of upwards of fifty in our garden at
times. Naturally the numbers vary according to the breeding season.
In the last few years we have tried to revive the Carolinas. The old
birds thrive and young are hatched, but though this has been a
favourable season for young Ducks, we have many families of young
Mandarins but I am not aware of a single young Carolina surviving.

They nest in the old trees in the Park and have access to water
everywhere. It has been a very dry season, perhaps somewhat cold,
but not cold enough, one would have thought, to affect what should be
a hardy bird.
We have nine young Emperor Geese and six Red-breasted Geese
now getting their feathers.
In the case of the Red-breasted, we had the same birds some fourteen
to fifteen years before they bred at all, though they occasionally paired ;
now they lay annually. M Bedford.

MISBEHAVIOUR OF FISCHER'S LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998919434782609" page_id="56215944"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
Sin,--Perhaps my unfortunate experience with Fischer's Lovebirds
might serve as a warning to other members of the Avicultural Society
who believe these birds to be of an amiable disposition.
I have had two cocks in an aviary 8 feet by 12 feet, with three pairs
of Budgerigars and a few other Lovebirds and Weavers for about three
months, and until last week their conduct was exemplary.
Last Thursday, however, a nest of Blue Budgerigars was just
hatching and, evidently attracted by the noise made by the young, the
Fischer's were trying to get into the nest-box. They flew away as I
approached, and the cock Budgerigar then left the nest--with the whole
of the upper mandible neatly cut off. The bird was, of course, quite
unable to feed, and I was compelled to destroy it.
I removed the Fischer's at once, and having no other accommodation
available, I put them with my Stanley Parrakeets, where I thought
they would be safe.
The following evening, when the hen Stanley left the nest (she had
been sitting ten days) she looked into the box in which the Fischer's
were roosting and immediately gave a terrible squawk, and I rushed
down to the aviary only to find her in exactly the same condition as the
Budgerigar.
I was very upset at this, and amazed too, as a Stanley is four or
five times as big as a Fischer's Lovebird, and I had little hope of
saving her.

However, I offered soaked bread and chopped pea-nuts and to-day
she is going on splendidly and shows every sign of nesting again shortly.
Her original five eggs were spoiled the first night.
The cock bird has fed her all the time, and this is probably the
reason she has survived. If the upper mandible will only grow again
(I don't know whether it will) before they finish nesting, I have no
doubt she will make a complete recovery.
Neither the Stanley nor the Budgerigar seemed very much distressed
by its terrible injury, but a bird thus injured is not pleasant to look at.

Sir, --I should like to draw attention to the fact that the male
Melanistic Mutant Pheasant now in the Zoo, which assumed the typical
plumage of the variety when he came into colour in his birth year, 1926,
is now very far from typical; in fact, he looks like a half bred versi-
color, having assumed much of the reddish hue of the ordinary
Pheasant when he moulted last year, while there was an indication
of this the year before, the red showing out like the glow in the Bronze
Turkey's plumage. I should also like to mention that our member,
Mr. G. Palmer, got this year a young Goldfinch Mule which was mostly
black in colour (though the wings were normal) and that this bird,
when I last visited his establishment, was rapidly assuming the colour
of the ordinary " dark mule ", and will no doubt be indistinguishable
from one when this appears.
I have several times read of black Mules in Cage Birds, or heard of
them, but this is the first I have seen ; it would be interesting to know
if they often revert in this way. A fancier I met at Mr. Palmer's told
me that he once bred a very black Mule and three white ones in one
nest from a Siberian Goldfinch mated to a pale buff hen Canary.

REVIEW
THE BIRDS OF SOUTH-EAST DEVON 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707647058824" page_id="56215946"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
In recent years it has become the custom of students of bird-life
to specialize in the avifauna of some particular district, and a good
many books have appeared recently on the birds of the different
counties. The latest of such books deals only with part of a county,
the beautiful country of Devon, lying to the east of the Exe. This is a
rich land of birds, the country being varied and including such estuaries
as those of Seaton and Dawlish, commons such as Honiton and
Woodbury, rivers, cultivated land, marshes, and well-wooded valleys.
Interesting accounts of the various species are given and some of
these are very interesting. The Nightingale is a rare bird so far west
as Devon, but it occasionally appears, and when it does is warmly
welcomed. One appeared near Exmouth in 1927, and was thought so
much of that a well-patronized charabanc was run to the spot every
evening for two or three weeks.
The Goldfinch, we are told, is steadily increasing in numbers, and
certainly we have seen more of these birds in Devonshire than elsewhere.
The book is illustrated with some excellent photographic plates.

The letter from the Duchess of Bedford, printed on page 193,
confirms me in my belief that the Mandarin Duck might, with a little
trouble, be established as a breeding species and a most ornamental
object in the parks and open spaces of London. As mentioned in
the June number, it has been so established in Berlin and now we are
told that at Woburn, although a few stray, flocks of upwards of fifty

appear in the garden&amp;apos; at times, showing that this most ornamental
of the Ducks has become thoroughly established there.
It would seem that the method to adopt in London would be to
place on the ponds, such as that in St. James' Park, a number of birds
unpinioned but wing-clipped at a time some months previous to the
moulting season, so. that they would become thoroughly accustomed
to their surroundings before they moulted and regained their powers
of flight. When imported, Mandarin Ducks are usually merely wing-
clipped, but unfortunately a number that happen to be in the market
at the present time are all pinioned, so are useless for our purpose,
but it is to be hoped that others will arrive during the next few months
and I am promised a very generous contribution towards the cost of
the birds and am assured of the help and support of those in
authority in the Royal Parks. So we may hope to eventually carry
out this experiment.
The Barbary or Ringed Turtle-dove appears to have been naturalized
in Los Angeles, California, according to a letter in the Condor , the writer
of which noticed at least twenty pairs feeding from persons' hands
and breeding in the palm-trees in Pershing Square.
From observations of the Ceylon Jungle-fowl ( Gallus lafayetti) in
the Zoological Gardens, it is evident that the male bird does not have
an eclipse plumage such as is assumed by G. sonnerati and G. gallus
when the latter is really pure. It is also noticeable that G. lafayetti
does not reach maturity until, apparently, its second year, young
cocks bred early in 1928 being still no further advanced than young
Red Jungle-fowls would be at six months old.
Our member, Mr. J. N. T. Otaki, recently secured from a dealer in
London some very beautiful Red Cardinals, which proved to be Scarlet
Cardinals, Cardinalis phceniceus. The species occurs in Venezuela and
was exhibited in the Zoological Gardens in 1908. The male has the head,

crest, and whole of the underparts scarlet; the wings, rump, and tail
vermilion red and a black patch on the chin. The female has the
mantle, back, and rump olive-brown, the outer edge of the quills being
tinged with red.
The Steamer Duck is a very rare species in captivity, and it is not
easy to see why it has not been imported more often than it has, for it
seems to be perfectly hardy and easily kept, and with suitable accom-
modation there should be a prospect of its breeding. Like the general
run of Southern Ducks, it has no eclipse plumage, and like other Ducks
it moults all its flight-feathers simultaneously.
Those who keep Lovebirds with other species should read carefully
the letter on page 194 from Mr. C. Best. All the Lovebirds (Agapornis)
are untrustworthy with others less powerful than themselves, and
although no harm may result for a time, sooner or later a tragedy is
most likely to occur.

THE ORANGE-AND-WHITE-BREASTED
TOUCAN (RHAMPHASTOS VITELLINUS )
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99638615" page_id="56215957"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Capt. E. F. E. Hammond
The Toucan depicted in the accompanying plate, Rkamphastos
mtellinus. is variously described as the Orange-and-white-breasted,
Sulphur-and-white-breasted, and Orange-breasted Toucan. I have
chosen the first for the heading of this short account of the bird, as it
is the most descriptive.
This Toucan is more closely allied to the Ariel than to any other
of the Rkamphastos family, although his brilliant blue naked orbital
patch gives him such a different appearance. He shares with the
Ariel and the Green-billed the distinction of having the upper tail-
coverts scarlet; all other members of the Rkamphastos family having
the tail-coverts white (as the Toco, Sulphur-breasted and Tocard),
or yellow or orange (as the Bed-billed, Cuviers, etc.).
Tbe specimen which I have was imported in June, 1928, by
Mr. Chapman, together with a number of Bed-billed, Ariel, and Green-
billed and, although at first he appeared very delicate, he seems quite
as hardy as any other Toucan now he has moulted out. The British
Museum gives the habitat as Trinidad, Venezuela, Guiana, and Lower
Amazonia, and it is the only Toucan which has its habitat in Trinidad.
There are, I believe, no longer any Toucans in Trinidad, and have not

The family Turturidce, formerly known as Peristeridce, appears tn
contain at least two distinct groups, the Turtle Doves and the Ground
Doves. The former are lighter built birds, spending much time perching,
but feeding on the ground, while the latter are stouter ground-feeding
and ground-living birds with very stout feet and shorter wings. In the
wild state they feed on seeds of weeds, sometimes grain, green shoots,
wild peas, berries, small worms, and smooth caterpillars. In captivity
they do well upon a diet of white millet, dari, a little hemp, and
occasionally small earthworms.

The Carolina Dove ( Zenaidura macroura carolinensis). A very
common bird in the Eastern States of North America, from Canada to
the Southern States, in the summer, it breeds from April to June,
two nests at least being reared. It arrives from the south in MarcR
and feeds largely on beech-nuts, seeds, and waste grain, and a consider-
able amount of insect food. In America it is known as the Mourning
Dove from its long drawn mournful note of " Oh-woe-woe-woe ". Above
greyish-brown with black spots on the wing-coverts and scapulars ;
head brownish-red ; a black spot behind the eye and another below
the ear-coverts ; sides of neck metallic purplish-red ; under surface
pale reddish-brown with the breast washed with purple. The tail is
rather long and graduated, of fourteen feathers, black at the base, outer
ones tipped with white, the others with whitish tips, becoming bluer
towards the middle feathers, which are brown. The female is duller,
greyish-brown below. Habitat, east North America from South
Canada to the Gulf States ; also the Bahamas. It is only seldom

imported and it is difficult to know exactly to which race the birds
should be assigned. Typical macroura comes from the Greater Antilles,
other races from western North America, Clarion Island, and Tres
Marias Islands, Western Mexico.
Grayson's or Socorro Mourning Dove (Z. graysoni). Colonel
Grayson says of this Dove : "Of all the birds I met with on the Island,
these seemed to be the most lovely ; not a flock or even a pair were
ever seen together. They are remarkably tame, perhaps more so than
any bird of this order. One was captured by hand as it came into
our camp, and perched upon the rude table on which I was at work ;
its melancholy look appeared to be in keeping with the solitude of,
and its sombre plumage corresponding with the grey brush and brown
volcanic rock composing its wild home." Mr. H. Bright received
four examples in 1925 and reared two young ones the following year;
an account appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for August, 1926.
Mr. Gifford, of California, and Mme Lecallier have also bred it. Very
similar to the last described but with the under parts including under
tail-coverts deep rufous cinnamon. Habitat, Socorro Island, Western
Mexico.
The Martinique Dove (Zenaida aurita). Colonel Feilden gives
some notes of this species in Barbados, in The Ibis, 1889. He says :
" This beautiful species is not uncommon in places where it obtains
protection, being numerous in the grounds of Codrington College,
where it nests on the fronds of the lofty palmistes. . . This species nests
in cliffs as well as, on trees." It has frequently been imported, Miss
Alderson bred it freely and I had a pair which nested. Upper parts
brown ; inner upper wing-coverts and some of the scapulars with black
spots edged with white, a conspicuous white band at the tip of the
secondaries ; head vinous rufous ; two steel-blue spots on sides of
head ; two patches on hind neck metallic-amethyst; breast rufous-
cinnamon, fading in the lower parts and under tail-coverts to pure
white ; outer tail-feathers black at base with white tips. The female
is similar but not so bright. The young lack the spots on the head
and the metallic colour on the neck. Habitat, Lesser Antilles and
St. Croix.

being met with in flocks, it spends much time on the ground and may
be seen on the dusty roads in Jamaica. It feeds on seeds and berries.
The nest is sometimes placed not more than a yard from the ground,
and in the Bahamas nests have been found placed in holes in the rocks.
General appearance very like the Martinique Dove, having the same
white band on the secondaries, but darker ; the black spots on the
scapular, and wing-coverts have no white edges, and the breast, abdomen,
and under tail-coverts are deep vinous. Habitat, Florida Keys,
Bahamas, Cuba, Isle of Pines, Little Cayman, Cayman Brae, Jamaica,
and Haiti. Other races from the easternmost Greater Antilles and
Sombrero, St. Eustatius and Antigua, Lesser Antilles ; also from the
coast of Yucatan. The names amabilis and meridionodis have been
given to this bird, but zenaida seems to be the correct one.
The Auriculated or Bronze-necked Dove (Z. auriculata).
Hudson in his Birds of La Plata says : " This is the commonest species
of the Pigeon tribe in the Argentine country. In autumn they often
congregate in very large flocks and are sometimes observed migrating,
flock succeeding flock all travelling in a northerly direction ; but these
autumnal migrations are irregular, and apparently depend on the
supply of food ; incredible numbers will winter on the plains when
the giant thistle has covered the plains in summer, congregating every
evening wherever there are trees enough to afford a suitable roosting-
place." They seem to prefer to nest near a human habitation for the
sake of protection from birds of prey. The species has been freely
imported ; an account of its nesting in captivity will be found by the
late Mr. Cresswell in the third volume of the Avicultural Magazine.
Head vinous with grey crown and two black spots on the side ;
upper surface brownish-olive with black spots on wing-coverts and
scapulars, there is no white band on the secondaries ; sides of neck and
nape metallic-purple with golden reflections ; front of neck and breast
vinous, passing into bufflsh-white on the under tail-coverts ; flanks
grey; upper surface of tail grey-brown with a black band across the
middle, the three outer pair with white tips. Female duller. Habitat,
nearly the whole of South America except the north-eastern part.
The genus Zenaida closely resembles Zenaidura. There are fourteen
tail-feathers but the tail is moderate and rounded.

The Galapagan Dove ( Nesopelia galapagcensis). This Dove
was formerly very abundant in the Archipelago. It inhabits dry,
rocky soil and often feeds with the flocks of the curious black Finches
of the genus Geospiza. It used to be so tame that it could be knocked
down by hand and even now seems remarkably tame. General colour
brownish-olive ; scapulars and upper wing-coverts brown, many with
whitish centres with a black spot on each side ; crown of head, breast,
and abdomen vinous ; ear-coverts whitish with a black strip above
and below ; tail brown with a black bar across the middle. Habitat,
Galapagos Islands. Two races known.
The White-winged Dove (Melopelia asiatica). It is a pity that
this pretty North American Dove can no longer be called by the
appropriate name of leucoptera. Common in the West Indies, Gosse
says that in Jamaica they live in flocks of twenty or thirty, flying in
flocks like tame Pigeons. They feed on castor-oil seeds and orange-pips
largely. The species was first bred by the late Miss Alderson in 1901,
for which she received the Avicultural Society's Medal. An account
appeared in Yol. VIII of the Magazine. Upper surface, throat, and
breast greyish-brown ; a broad white band on. the wing from the
bend to the tips of the greater-coverts ; secondaries blackish margined
with white ; head purplish shot with golden green on sides of neck ;
a black stripe below the ears ; central tail feathers brown, the rest
dark grey tipped with greyish-white. Female similar, but with less
purplish on the head. Habitat, southern border of the United States
to Costa Rica, Bahamas, and Greater Antilles. A larger and paler
race inhabits south New Mexico to Lower California, and an allied
species ( meloda ), a little larger with less light grey on the tail, is found
in Peru and Chile.
The Black-winged Dove (Metriopelia melanoptera). I am
placing this species here as Reichenow in 1913 pointed out that this
bird is really allied to Zenaida and has nothing to do with aymara,
which was associated with it. This latter bird with the yellow stripe
across the wing is allied to the Pecui with a steel-blue bar. The Black-
winged Dove inhabits the high regions of the Andes from 6,000 to 13,000
feet. Goodfellow found it numerous near Cotopaxi in Ecuador among
rocks and lava, with nothing but a few tufts of coarse grass. General

colour greyish-brown ; sides of neck and breast pale vinous ; flights
and tail blackish ; bend of wing white ; a primrose-yellow spot in
front of the eye. The female without the vinous tinge on the under
parts. Habitat, western South America from Ecuador to Central
Chile and Argentina. A darker race in west Ecuador.
We have now arrived at the typical Turtle Doves or subfamily
Streptopeliince . They are medium-sized birds with a more or less
distinct dark collar or with scale-like patches on the neck. The
different species very easily hybridize. I have obtained birds with
the blood of five distinct species. Nevertheless, as they can be easily
separated into groups, as was done by Sharpe in his Hand-List, I will
do the same here, though they are certainly not worth more than sub-
generic value.
The Turtle Dove ( Streptopelia (Amoropelia) turtur). By another
unfortunate turn in modern nomenclature the genus Turtur can no
longer be used for the Turtle Doves but must be transferred to a genus
of African Bronze-wings to which it was first applied. The Common
Turtle Dove of our woods and open country needs no description
as it is so well-known. If unmolested it will come and feed with poultry.
Though it leaves us in winter it is quite hardy and will live during the
winter in an unheated aviary. It crosses freely with the Barbary
Dove, producing fertile hybrids. One hen bird I had used to fly at
liberty. Habitat, nearly the whole of Europe, with Madeira and the
Canary Islands and Western Asia. Tropical Africa in winter. Four
examples of the very interesting Isabelline Turtle Dove (S. (A.) t.
isabellina) were deposited in the London Zoo in May, 1920. It is a
more sandy-coloured bird than the typical race, especially on the head.
Habitat, North-East Africa. The Eastern Turtle Dove (S. (A.
orientalis). A large dark edition of our bird. It is common in Japan,
and its habits resemble those of the European Turtle Dove. After
the nesting season it is found in flocks. Like S. turtur but larger,
the scaly feathers on the neck are edged with grey ; the under tail-
coverts and tips of the tail-feathers are also grey. Habitat, India,
North of Assam, Manchuria, Corea, and Japan.
The Northern Indian Turtle Dove (S. (A.) 0. ferr ago) has been
sparingly imported. I possessed a pair, but they never attempted to

nest. The cock occasionally uttered a deep guttural " kur-kur-kur ".
In the wild state they seek their food of grain and seed on the ground.
They prefer a combination of cultivated areas and patches of jungle,
near water. They nest at lower altitudes than the typical form and
congregate in flocks of often over a hundred individuals during migra-
tion. Differs from orientalis by its paler coloration. Whitish on chin,
abdomen, under tail-coverts and terminal band on tail; bill pinkish-
horn, pinker on sides near tip ; basal part with nostrils carmine.
The female has been described as same as the male. In my pair the
female differed by being smaller, less ashy on forehead, not so white
on chin, and the fore neck and breast were without the vinous tinge of the
male and all the colours less bright. Habitat, west Central Asia,
Turkestan, Persia, Afghanistan, and the Himalayas, East to West
Nepal and Lower Sikkim. In winter over West and South India even
to Ceylon.
The Madagascar Turtle Dove (S. {Homopelia) picturata) is the
type of a small group of Turtle Doves to which Salvadori gave the sub-
generic name of Homopelia . Distinguished by their unmottled upper
wing-coverts and absence of a black collar on the hind neck, they are
confined to the Madagascarian sub-region. This bird is common in
Madagascar, where it is found in pairs or small flocks of from six to
eight individuals, particularly in plantations and cultivated fields.
They feed on grain and make great ravages in the rice fields at the time
of sowing and harvest. It was first received at the London Zoological
Gardens in 1866. In 1907 I secured a pair and successfully bred it,
and an account will be found in the Avxcultural Magazine, Yol. YI
(New Series), 1907-8. Head grey ; wings brown ; scapular region
tinged with rich vinous-purple ; fore neck and breast vinous, gradually
fading to white on the under tail-coverts; feathers on hind neck and sides
of neck with concealed black bases and bifurcated tips which are
greyish-vinous ; lateral tail feathers dark grey with ashy tips. Habitat,
Madagascar ; also Mauritius, Keunion, and the Seychelles, where it has
probably been introduced.
The Aldabra Turtle Dove (S. ( H .) picturata aldabrana) cannot
be considered more than a race of the Madagascar. Little has been
recorded of its wild life. It was described (1871) from a pair of living

birds in the London Zoological Gardens : they reared a young one in
spite of the hen having an injured wing. Differs from true picturata
by having the head vinous and with a distinct amethystine lustre on
the feathers on the sides of the neck. Habitat, Aldabra Island. Other
closely allied races from the Comoro Islands, Gloriosa, Diego Garcia,
Assumption and Amirante Group ; while a distinct species with
large thick bill inhabits the Seychelles.
The typical members of the sub-genus Streptopelia form an
interesting group. They are all (with three exceptions) African birds,
and are distinguished by their uniform unspotted wings and complete
black collar round the hind neck.
The Half-collared Turtle Dove (S. semitorquatus) is the largest
of the Turtle Doves. A common bird over the greater part of Africa,
inhabiting the edges of clearings, feeding on wild fruits and berries
and taking a heavy toll of grain. This Dove is frequently imported
and breeds freely. I obtained three birds in 1906 and reared many
young ones. An account appeared in the Avicultural Magazine,
Yol. V (New Series), pp. 318-24. Crown grey, paler on forehead;
a buffy tint on the cheeks ; rest of head and chest deep vinous-pink
passing into lead-grey on the under tail-coverts ; wings and central
tail-feathers dark brown ; a red bare space round the eye. Habitat,
from the Egyptian Sudan and Abyssinia ; also South-West Africa south
to inland districts of Kenya to east South Africa. Other races from
south Somaliland and West Africa.
The Deceptive Turtle Dove (S. decipiens) is a very attractive
species. It is very abundant in the Egyptian Sudan, feeding on seeds
and grain and nesting by hundreds in medium-sized acacia-trees, it
has a very curious loud note which corresponds to the laughing note
of the Barbary Dove but which sounds like the " mur-r-r " note of the
Guillemot. It is not very often imported. I had three typical birds
and two cocks of the East African permista. An account of the nesting
and habits will be found in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. I (3),
February, 1910. I did not find the species so hardy as most of the
Turtle Doves. It is not unlike a small Half-collared: upper surface
a warm brown ; breast vinous changing into lead-grey on the flanks ;
under tail-coverts paler grey tipped with whitish; crown and cheeks

ashy ; chin and throat nearly white ; anterior part of head and nape
vinous ; a very broad black collar edged above with ashy white on the
hind neck; central tail feathers greyish-brown ; basal half of under
surface of tail black, apical half light grey; bare skin round the eye grey
tinged with pink. Habitat, northern part of the Sudan, south to
Lake No, east to Sennar, and west to Kordofan. The East African
Deceptive Dove ( S . d. permista) has all the colours brighter and
darker ; back more ruddy-brown, and cheeks a shade darker grey ;
white on chin and abdomen purer, a broad bare circle of red skin round
the eye. Habitat, East Africa from Victoria Nyanza to the Zambesi.
Five other races have been described.
The Doubled-Ringed Turtle Dove (S. bitorquata). A very
handsome species ; like most Javan birds very little has been recorded
about its wild life. Though very freely imported into India, where
it is said to be quite a drag on the market in Calcutta, it is rarely seen
in this country. I obtained two specimens in 1906 and two more in
1909. Most unfortunately, all four were male birds. Above earth-
brown ; outer wing-coverts leaden-grey ; central tail-feathers brown,
lateral feathers dark grey at base with bluish-grey tips ; crown grey,
paler in front; chin whitish ; a broad black collar with a white line
above across the hind neck; under surface rich vinous fading to
white on lower abdomen and under tail-coverts. Habitat, Java,
Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Solor, and Timor.
The Cape Turtle Dove (S. capicola). A very common bird in
South Africa, breeding in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, going
about in pairs, though many may be seen feeding together on the
ground on grain and seeds. Mr. W. Sclater remarks that its constant
harsh cooing becomes somewhat wearisome. I can well believe this
as I remember what a constant noise a cock bird I had used to make.
It is generally to be seen in the Zoological Gardens. Upper surface
greyish-brown changing to leaden-grey on the outer upper wing-
coverts ; sides of lower back and rump, tail, central feathers brown ;
outer ones black at base, with ends of outer feathers white ; crown
lead-grey; sides of head, neck, and chest vinous-grey, middle of
abdomen buffy-white fading to pure white on under tail-coverts ;
a black collar and black line on the lores. Habitat, South Africa, east

to Natal, north to South Transvaal. This is the typical and darkest
race. The Damaraland Turtle Dove (S. c. damarensis ), which is
most abundant in Damaraland, is said to have been imported. It is the
palest race known. I think that the birds which belonged to the late
Miss Alderson, and which were identified as damarensis , were really
the East African form, S. c. tropica. They were imported with other
Doves, which I know came from the Zambesi. I have the. skins of
two young birds bred from them, and they are certainly too dark&amp;apos; for
the Damaraland Dove ; tropica is an intermediate form from Uganda
and the inland parts of East Africa to North Transvaal. Three or
four closely allied races are known.
The Vinaceous Turtle Dove (S. vinacea) is the smallest and
brightest coloured member of this group. It is extremely common,
according to G. L. Bates, throughout Cameroon. Seen continually
in the scrubby trees and on the ground, especially along the road,
it is the common Dove of the countryside as the Senegal is the town
Dove. It was breeding from November to February, and its rapidly
uttered note was constantly heard. This note is described as " Barbaru-
barbaru-barbaru ", which caused Antinori in 1864 to describe one of
its races as S. v. barbaru. Can this have anything to do with the name
" Barbary ", by which the nearly allied cage-bird is familiarly known ?
The Vinaceous Turtle Dove has been very frequently represented at
the London Zoological Gardens, where it has bred freely. I have only
had a single hen bird. Head, neck, and breast vinous pink, paler
on forehead and changing to white on chin, throat, and under tail-
coverts ; a black line on the lores like the Cape Turtle ; black collar
edged above with whitish ; upper surface earthy brown, pale grey on
bend of wing ; outer tail feathers black at base with white tips.
Habitat, from Senegal and Nigeria, east to Abyssinia. Four races
known.
The Bose-grey Turtle Dove (S. roseogrisea). Mr. A. L. Butler
found it the commonest Dove in the Soudan. Near Khartoum it is
exceedingly numerous, over fifty being seen in one tree near the river ;
it is also well distributed ail over the desert. They were nesting in
acacia bushes from 3 to 6 feet from the ground. Two birds were
deposited in the London Zoological Gardens in May, 1920. This species

is of very great interest to aviculturists, as it is without doubt the
wild ancestor of the tame Barbary Dove (S. risoria). I have gone
fully into this question in an article which appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine, Yol. XII (3), p. 100, July, 1921. Very like the domestic
Barbary Dove but smaller and with the head, neck, and breast washed
with delicate pink ; a black collar on hind neck, but no black on lores.
Habitat, North-East Africa. A race with dull blue-grey under wing-
coverts from South-West Arabia is known as S. r. arahica.
The Indian Ring-dove (S. decaocto) is resident in India, common
in cultivated country round villages and towns, very sociable, feeding
in company on the ground on seeds, grain, and berries. The note is
a " koo-koo-Tcoo " very different from that of the Barbary Dove. It
is also found in Palestine and Asia Minor. I have seen it near
Constantinople, and in Palestine I found it common on the plain near
the Dead Sea. They were retiring to roost in the palm-trees at Jericho.
Sixteen examples reached the London Zoological Gardens in May,
1912. A pair hatched young which were not reared, I believe. Three
specimens came into my possession but I failed to breed the species.
Head, neck, and chest pale vinous, paler on chin and forehead ; flanks,
abdomen, and under tail-coverts grey; a black ring on hind neck;
back, scapulars pale brown, passing into pearl-grey on outer wing-coverts
and secondaries ; under surface of tail sharply divided into a black base
and white-grey apical portion. Habitat, India and Ceylon; also
Western Asia to China and Japan, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor,
Palestine, and Siberia.
The Burmese Ring-dove (S. d. xanthocycla). In October, 1896,
three Doves under the name Douraca Doves (Turtur douraca) were
received at the London Zoological Gardens. They came from Burma
and were supposed to belong to the common India form. My attention
having been drawn to them, or rather to the sole survivor, on account
of the yellow ring round the eye, I gave it the name xanthocylus (Avi-
cultural Magazine, Vol. IV (New Series), p. 321,1906). It is common
in Burma in the dry zone, especially in the open spaces and cultivation
near villages. Differs from the Indian bird by being slightly larger
with all its colours darker and more vivid, but easily distinguished by
broad yellow bare rings round the eyes. One of my birds from India

had the edges of eyelids and bare skin round the eye light bluish-grey.
Habitat, Burma.
The genus CEnopopelia much resembles Streptopelia but it is dis-
tinguished by its long wing with the first primary almost as long as
the second and by the different coloration of the sexes, which is unique
among the Turtle Doves. It contains only a single species.
The Indian Dwarf or Buddy Turtle Dove (CE. tranquebarica).
This charming little bird is the smallest of the Turtles. It is a
common and confiding species, keeping to well-wooded country near
water, where it can drink morning, noon, and evening. It feeds on
the ground on seeds, grain, and berries, and generally breeds in large
trees away from the villages. In Annam it breeds in all the gardens
of the city. It has frequently been imported. I reared a number of
young some years ago. The male bird has the upper part of the head,
lower back, rump, upper tail-coverts, under wing-coverts, and flanks
grey ; above and below vinous-red ; a black collar round back of neck ;
lateral tail-feathers slaty-black at base with broad terminal ashy-
white band. The female differs by being almost uniform earthy brown.
Habitat, India, east to Bengal to Western Nepal. West it is common
in Sind and the Punjab. The Burmese Buddy Turtle Dove
(CE. t. humilis). A number of birds under this name have been recorded
on exhibition at the London Zoological Gardens, but as the habitat
is given as " India 55 they were most probably true tranquebarica.
The Burmese bird only differs from the Indian by being richer coloured
and having the grey parts, especially the under wing-coverts, much
darker. Habitat, Assam, Burma, Indo-China to China and the
Andamans. An intermediate race inhabits East Nepal, Sikkim to
Assam.
We now arrive at the last genus of the true Turtle Doves, which
can be subdivided into two sections each with a single species but both
having a number of local races. Spilopelia, with feathers of hind
neck bifurcated, black, with two white apical spots and Stigmatopelia
with feathers of fore neck bifurcated, black, with two rufous apical
spots.
The Chinese Spotted Turtle Dove (Spilopelia chinensis) is
abundant and resident in China, placing its flimsy nest in a tree or

high bush : abundant also in Formosa on the plain. It is said to have
been represented at Amsterdam as early as 1843, while the London
Zoological Gardens record quite a number of specimens from 1869.
An elegantly shaped bird with longish graduated tail. Head grey,
paler on forehead ; nape black with the feathers forked and having
two white spots on their tips ; upper surface pale brown and feathers
unspotted; outermost wing-coverts lead-grey; under parts rich
vinous, passing into grey on the under tail-coverts ; three outer tail
feathers broadly tipped with white. Habitat, East China and Formosa.
The Burmese Spotted Turtle Dove ( S . c. tigrina). Robinson
says this bird is very common throughout the Malay Peninsula,
affecting open country and sandy plains. It occurs also in rice fields
near trees. It feeds on grass and other seeds on the ground in early
morning and afternoon. Found in pairs, also in flocks of six or seven.
They nest in low trees and bushes, often quite close to the ground.
This is a far better known bird than the typical Chinese Dove and breeds
very freely in captivity. I had a hen bird for some years. Differs
from chinensis by its smaller size, and having the under tail-coverts
white and the wing-coverts with dark brown shaft-lines. In a living
female the iris was rosy-red, pinker towards the pupil, no bare skin
round the eye, edges of eyelids grey ; bill slaty grey. Habitat, Burma,
Malay Peninsula, Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, Celebes, Timor,
and the Moluccas.
The Indian Spotted Turtle Dove ( S . c. suratensis). This most
familiar Indian bird is the prettiest member of the genus, very wide-
spread wherever there is. water, running about freely in gardens and
villages or searching the roads for grain and seeds, the pairs keeping
much together. They nest all the year round, both in trees and on
buildings. Like tigrina but having the wing-coverts marked with
two reddish spots on the sides of each feather at the tip. The eye is
surrounded by a red ring. Habitat, India. A smaller race in Ceylon,
and others from Yunnan,. North-West Yannan (Mountains), and
Hainan.
The Senegal Turtle Dove ( S . (Stigmatopelia) senegalensis). One
of the most freely imported species and easiest to breed. There are a
number of races, and it is quite impossible to say which have been

brought over. I have met with several of these in their wild state.
The first of these was thirty years ago in Jerusalem, where it was then
common, especially on the walls near the Damascus Gate; it does
not seem to be so plentiful there now. The bird found in Palestine
is supposed to be the same as that found in East Africa from
the Bed Sea Province south to the Cape Province extending to
South Nigeria in the west and South Arabia and Palestine in the
east. It is known as S. (S.) s. cequatorialis. It is very near the
typical bird but not so red and more vinous-pink on the breast.
In Egypt I met with cegyjptica ; probably the first bird seen
at Alexandria will be this. Numbers can be seen on the roofs of
the sheds or the wharfs or running about on the ground in search of
food. It is essentially a town bird, living and nesting on buildings.
This is a very red bird, rather larger than true senegalensis. It is con-
fined to Egypt. Lastly, in Algeria and Tunisia, south of the Atlas
Mountains, wherever there are palm groves I found Senegal Doves--or,
as they are rightly called, the Palm Doves--numerous. They live
in the date palm and perch on the mud walls of the native houses,
feeding in the surrounding open country in the neighbourhood of the
villages, their gentle trisyllabic note " Boo-boo-boo " being continually
heard. The North African form phoenicophila is rather larger, with
browner tips to the feathers of the upper parts and less pinkish on the
underside. Habitat, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco south of the Atlas.
Typical senegalensis has the head and breast rich vinous, a broad
black collar of bifurcated feathers with rust-coloured spots on the
tips encircles the front and sides of the neck; upper surface brown,
the feathers marked with rusty vinous; lower back, upper wing-coverts,
and secondaries lead-grey; abdomen and under tail-coverts white ;
central tail-feathers greyish-brown; outer ones slate-grey at base,
with white apical half. Habitat, Senegal and Northern Nigeria.
Allied forms from the Sudan and Socotra Island.
The Indian Little Brown Dove (S. (S.) s. cambaiensis) is also
another sub-species of senegalensis . It is one of the most familiar and
abundant of Indian Doves, frequenting the neighbourhood of houses
and coming into the verandahs. It abounds in cultivation, feeds on
the usual seeds and grain, nests from January to October in trees and

bushes at no great distance from the ground, and also on beams, window-
sills, in verandahs, and even on the ground. Differs from senegalensis
by having the upper parts pale earthy-brown, without the reddish
marks, and the rump brown-like back, never grey. Habitat, India.
A larger and paler race in Turkestan and Persia called ermanni.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Many years ago, I suppose, the title of this article would have
merited about as much interest and attention as one headed " The
Breeding of the Zebra Finch " or " The Breeding of the Budgerigar " ;
but times have changed : the lovely little Grass Parrakeet, once so
well known, dwindled, became rare, and finally disappeared and was
for a number of years believed to have joined the ranks of extinct
birds. Then it reappeared again, not in its former numbers, but just
a few scattered pairs, some of which were caught and found their way
into the hands of aviculturalists and dealers, Mr. Harvey of Adelaide,
being one of the first to breed the species again in confinement in its
own land. My own birds, which are the subject of this article, reached
me in the spring of 1928. They were then in nestling plumage, but
the sex of the young cock, as is always the case, was plainly discernible
by the greater amount of blue on his face and head. After a period
of rest and quarantine in the hospital, they were transferred to the
dining-room. As it is impossible to buy in the market any cage in
a condition suitable to accommodate any bird and as most cages
offered for sale in shops cannot even be rendered tolerable by a fairly
drastic process of refitting and overhauling to correct structural errors
and remove useless gadgets, all my stock cages for Parrakeets have to
be specially made by a local firm. That which the Turquoisines
occupied was a rectangular one of wire netting on a metal frame,
about 3 feet long by 2 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft. 6 in. It had a false roof of

canvas, which, is necessary to prevent all Grass Parrakeets from
fracturing their skulls, and some detachable sheets of zinc round the
back and sides to keep off draughts, for an unprotected all-wire cage is
a dangerous residence for delicate birds. (How many unhappy Wax-
bills meet with a premature end through being confined in that chilly
and unhygienic abomination known as a Crystal Palace " aviary 55 !)
As is usual with Australian Parrakeets imported at that time of year,
the young Turquoisines began to moult a few weeks after their arrival.
By this time they were getting back their strength and spirits and
indulged in as much playful frisking about as the narrow confines
of their cage allowed and in a little mild squabbling. The cock also
began to feed one of the hens. I felt sorely tempted to keep all of them,
but knowing too well the vilely unhealthy nature of Warblington,
where you cannot even moult an imported Ancona rooster, let alone
be safe with a delicate Parrakeet, I knew that I must be unselfish
and let two of the hens, at least, go to help the preservation experiment
I have initiated with the help of American friends, in California. I had
already sent over a cock and when I last had news of them he and one
of the ladies above mentioned had gone to nest and by now, I trust,
have reared a family.
The remaining pair passed the next few weeks uneventfully, but
just as I was thinking of putting them up for breeding I had a horrid
fright, for one morning I noticed the cock closing one eye and rubbing it.
In 999 cases out of 1,000 when you see a Grass Parrakeet doing this
it means the first onset of eye disease, and the bird's fate is sealed.
With a sinking heart I caught the cock and isolated him, fearing the
worst, but by a most lucky chance it proved to be some trivial and
passing irritation, no further symptoms developed, and I was able to
return him to his mate. We had another alarm with him some weeks
later, when he caught a chill, due, as I have since discovered, to the use
of damp sand on the cage floor. For years I had the most puzzling and
often serious and fatal trouble with chills in my warm bird-room
and in the house, and it was only when at last I noticed that these
illnesses always began the day after the cages were cleaned, that I
traced the trouble to its true source. Only a very slight degree of
moisture in the sand was enough to cause a dangerous illness, and

quite robust birds were occasionally among the victims. I lost a
lovely albino Koseate Cockatoo from this cause, and all but lost her
mate as well. The cock Turquoisine recovered in the hospital at a
temperature of 85*, but damp sand was destined to play us another
trick later on.
It being unsafe to put the birds in an outdoor aviary in such a
desperately unhealthy district, when summer arrived I turned them
into a large flight cage about 7 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet high and provided
them with a wooden nest-box filled with a few inches of earth. The
cage was placed on metal stands in a large and fairly sunny window
free from draughts.
The birds were in no particular hurry to go to nest, and when I
returned home at the beginning of August after an eight weeks' absence,
I found that no eggs had been laid and that the cock was again moulting,
having decided, as many Australian Parrakeets do their first year,
that although he had moulted barely three months before, it would be
as well to get into line with the customs of the northern hemisphere
by moulting again when all the other birds were so engaged. I nearly
took the nest away, but as the hen was not moulting and seemed to be
taking an increasing interest in domestic affairs, I decided to wait a
little longer. After a while, seeing that his wife meant business,
the cock stopped his moult (birds seem to be able to moult or to refrain
from moulting, just as they seem able to lay eggs or to refrain from laying
them, at their own pleasure rather than by reason of any compulsion
of their physical nature !) and began to give serious attention to his
duties as a husband. He did not utter a pleasant warbling song.
The Turquoisine, like all the Grass Parrakeets, has the gentlest of voices,
but the musical accomplishment above mentioned appears to be one of
those creations of the imagination to which old writers on aviculture
seem rather strangely prone. He did, however, help her to examine
the nest, and he also fed her ; and when she was near laying she wanted
a lot of feeding, constantly bobbing her head up and down with a little
rapid movement that was almost a quiver. The Turquoisine has not
a very marked display ; he is so beautiful when in ordinary movement
that he merely needs to draw his plumage a little extra tight, very
slightly spread and expand his wings from the shoulder and walk,

fly, and alight with a little extra swagger, to reveal the matchless
shades of enamelled blue in all their perfection.
It was the first week in September that the hen actually began
her clutch--four eggs as I afterwards discovered. We gave her gin
and glycerine mixture instead of water and there were no egg-binding
complications. She sat a bare three weeks, and when I returned from
a short absence I heard squeaks proceeding from the box--the tiniest*
most fairy-like squeaks it is possible to imagine. The cock was a
devoted father : as soon as his baby daughter arrived he started roosting
in the box and spent most of the first few days there as well. As he
was not needed to cover the small atom of white, fluff and could not
have spent so much time in feeding her or her mother, it must
be assumed that he liked being near her ! Two of the eggs were infertile
and one addled--not very surprising seeing that the male Turquoisine
was young, newly imported, and moulting about the time that they
were laid.
For a few days all went well; then I cleaned the cage. The old
pair were too steady and sensible to be at all upset, but again the sand
was a little damp and next morning the hen was off the nest and looking
slightly but most unmistakably ill ! The situation was one the
poignancy of which can only be appreciated by those who have been
similarly situated with their most valuable and treasured birds. What
was to be done ? Hand-rear the young one ? What chance was
there of keeping such a tiny and fragile nestling at the right temperature
and giving it the right food at the right intervals ? Finally I decided,
to move the whole family into the hospital. It was a desperate venture,
but the situation was desperate, for the neglected baby was already
squeaking plaintively with cold. The cage, as I have said, was a very
big one. When we got it down to the hospital we found it would not
go through the door ! However, by taking out the sand-trays and
taking an inner door off its hinges we got it in with a tight squeeze.
The radiators were turned on and the birds left quiet and all one could
do was to hope for the best. About an hour later I peered cautiously
through the window. The heat was doing its work and the hen looked
better. After a while she gave herself a shake and flew down to the
seed dish ; after feeding with due deliberation she approached the nest-

and, oh ! joy, went in. Later in the day she was still sitting and next
morning was quite herself again. Lor the time being the situation
was saved.
No further incident occurred until the young bird was old enough
to leave the nest. She made her first exit when I was away from home,
and the aviary attendant told me he had put her back as she did not
seem sufficiently developed to be out of her home. I was rather
surprised at this as an only child with the devoted care of two parents
should have made more rapid progress. A few days later I found her
on the floor of the cage myself, but alas ! it was a sad disappointment.
Although more than a month old she was a miserable-looking little
creature with the development of a nestling of only a fortnight. Her
body was still covered with down and her quills were only a quarter
grown. More serious defects were likewise apparent. Her legs were
weak and straddly and both back toes of one foot came forward ;
she appeared unable to close her beak, which was wide open, and she
breathed unnaturally heavily. She was in every way in much worse
condition than when she came out the first time, and it was evident
that the nest had not suited her at all. Although quite unable to fly
or even walk, her instinct had urged her to make a desperate effort
to get away from the environment that was quickly killing her (she was
much weaker than on the first occasion when the aviary attendant had
found her out) and it was lucky that she had done so, for a few more days
in the box would certainly have resulted in her death. I have reared
robust Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets in similar boxes with ease, but the
young Turquoisine had been attacked by rickets exactly as a Crimson-
wing would have been under like circumstances. The only thing
in the nestling's favour was that her eye was bright and her crop full,
but I never expected her to live more than a day or two. Very soon
she got into trouble on the cage floor and I found her a few hours later
with her eyes and beak full of sand. I therefore decided to fill the
entire bottom of the cage with short turf--by far the most comfortable
and health-giving material for a bird in her condition. After she had
fallen into every possible hole and I had discovered each one and filled
it up things began to go a bit better, though I must say I was surprised
to find her still alive next morning. I was rather uncertain whether

the parents would continue to feed her as birds commonly adopt an
attitude towards weakly children that says more for their appreciation
of eugenics than for their tenderness of heart. The cock, I think, was
a bit doubtful about going on with the job, being of opinion that his
daughter would never be a credit to him. The mother, however, stuck
most commendably to her task and each evening found the baby with
a full crop. In order to counteract the obvious tendency to rickets,
I started giving the young bird a mixture of raw egg, milk, and cod-liver
oil from the end of a paint-brush. From the first she took her tonic
like a lamb. I gave her about eight drops morning and evening,
and she would have taken more had I thought it prudent to increase
the allowance. She did not, however, become tame, and it needed
some care and patience to avoid alarming her. After a few days it
became apparent that her early decease was less certain than I had
expected. A few days more and she was undoubtedly stronger and
beginning to move about with greater activity. Then one morning
to my great joy and surprise I saw that she was using the back
toes of her defective foot and not long afterwards she was running
about the cage in quite a normal manner. The introduction of
a twiggy branch on the floor soon encouraged perching, and her
feathers were growing steadily. She never at any time showed
44 French moulty " weakness of the quills of her flight's and tail, but
it was a long while before her cheeks and head were properly
feathered. All this time her beak had been slowly closing ; she began
to eat green food and soaked seed. Her wing-feathers were fully
grown, and at last the great day arrived when she actually used them
to good purpose. I happened to witness her first attempt: her
parents had just flown up on to the high perch. She watched them,
gathered herself for an effort, and shot up into the air in the most
creditable manner. She did not succeed in landing, but it was
from inexperience rather than lack of wing power, and she
turned and flew back nearly the length of the cage before
coming to the ground again. A few moments later she had
another try, and this time settled beside her parents. The
hopeless little cripple was actually reared into quite a presentable
specimen ! Once she could fly the young Turquoisine quickly began

Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of the Turquoisine 219
to refuse my egg-milk ministrations, and after leaving the mixture
in her cage for some time longer for her to drink if she felt inclined,
I finally gave it up altogether, and put her on the usual diet of canary,
white and spray millet, oats and green food, hemp being bad for
Turquoisines, though not harmful to Blue-wings. A week or two later
I noticed that her father was getting tired of her, and was inclined to
swear at her and drive her off when she approached him. I therefore
put her in a separate cage as long as her old one but not quite so high,
keeping her still on turf which is changed weekly. I was a bit anxious
at first, as I had read dreadful stories of young Turquoisines starving
themselves to death when first separated from their parents, but her
appetite did not suffer and, indeed, she has never had a day's illness.
About mid-winter she began to look rather ragged and I feared she
might have parasites or be starting to pluck herself, but it turned out
to be nothing more alarming than her first moult. She moulted
very clean, and is now a handsome hen almost as big as her mother.
She would have been quite ready to try to breed this summer, but
owing to the vicissitudes of her early career I felt it would be very
imprudent to allow her to make the attempt before her second summer.
Probably she will never make a good stock bird, but it would be very
interesting if she did.
The old Turquoisines came back to the dining-room after their
daughter was launched in the world. They are still rather at sea
over their moulting, with the result that during the past fifteen months
they have had almost as many moults as a grouse ! They had one
soon after their arrival; the cock had another partial one in July;
they both moulted in mid-winter after breeding, and they again
moulted in April at the usual Australian season. All those moults were
perfectly healthy and normal, and in no way affected their condition
or spirits. At the end of May I put them up for breeding, giving the
hen a bottomless box of sacking on a wooden frame which stands on
the floor of the cage in a very thick turf. The entrance hole was
about three inches from the floor. She soon took to this new type of
nest and came into breeding condition quicker than I expected and
before I had put in the gin and glycerine. The result was that one
morning, to my disgust, I found her egg-bound with her first egg-

220 Marquess of Tavistock--The Breeding of the Turquoisine
I put her in a small cage in the hospital and after a long wait the egg
arrived. I placed it in the nest and the hen back in the cage, but I soon
discovered that, unlike most egg-bound hens, she had not recovered
at once, but was still feeling unwell. This time the whole breeding
cage had to go back to the hospital. She recovered in the heat, but
took no interest in the egg and finally broke it to bits, making further
excavations for a new nest. I greatly feared that she was out of
condition from lack of exercise, and that she would never do any more
good until I moved to a place healthy enough for her to inhabit a
proper aviary. However, I resolved to do the best I could and when
she again seemed near laying, I not only gave her gin and glycerine
but placed a portable electric stove near the nest. (How blessed is
the steady, fumeless heat of electricity for such emergencies !) To
my relief and surprise this time all went well and she laid no less than
five eggs, some, at any rate, of which have duly hatched. It will be
interesting to see if the new nest arrangements prevent the recurrence
of rickets in this brood.
It cannot be said that the domestic life of my Turquoisines is one
of undisturbed bliss, though I fancy the rather frequent upsets are
more due to individual peculiarity of temperament than characteristic
of the species. Eather serious rows are of pretty regular occurrence,
and I have more than once been on the point of separating the com-
batants to prevent serious disaster. Usually the cock is the aggressor,
but occasionally the hen turns the tables on him and gives him beans
for the way in which he has treated her on a former occasion. Like
many Parrakeets, the cock is liable to lose his temper with his wife
if he thinks she is unduly slow about settling down to her domestic
duties and chases her savagely about with every sign of anger until
she takes refuge in the nest. He also possesses the peculiarity that
he cannot bear to have another Grass Parrakeet, and particularly
another Turquoisine, in the same room. If he hears one call he
instantly attacks his mate with the greatest fury and would certainly
kill her if the offending neighbour were not instantly removed.
Apparently he thinks there is no point in the distinction of being an
almost extinct bird if you are to live in a place which constantly
resounds with the conversation of your relatives, and he blames his

partner for inviting such a crush through her feminine love of social
gatherings ! I have often remonstrated with him over the unreason-
ableness and unfairness of his prejudices, but so far wholly without effect!
What is going to be the fate of the Turquoisine ? In a wild state
its future does not appear hopeful. It is true that it has come back,
but in nothing like its former numbers. What has been the cause of
the disappearance of the flocks mentioned by old writers ? We know
that a good many have been shot, and it is not difficult to see that
poison, bush fires, feral cats, the destruction of drought refuges by
increasing settlement, and the prevention of the seeding of the grass
by grazing sheep may all be adverse influences. But probably
Mr. Mathews is right in suggesting that man is not wholly responsible
for the decrease of the Grass Parrakeets and that they are going down
before those adverse natural influences which have been removing
species from the world before the dawn of history and within recent
years, especially in the New World, have mysteriously wiped out
certain birds which are known never to have been the victims of serious
human persecution. If this be true, no legislation nor protective
measures can save the Turquoisine in a wild state. In Australia,
in confinement, it has bred freely since its re-discovery, but it also
seems to have died freely, whether from preventable causes I cannot
say. In Europe it probably could be saved, but it is not likely that
the attempt will be made. It is an easy matter to breed Turquoisines
once or twice, but to maintain a stock involves trouble, some expense,
and some self-denial. They are not everybody's birds : intolerant
of the presence of their own kind, adult pairs must be kept separate ;
only half-hardy, they cannot safely be wintered in outdoor aviaries ;
needing extreme cleanliness in all their surroundings they cannot
for many years survive the dirt of the average bird-room ; not even
the relative degree of dirt present in the rooms of those who would
be highly indignant if it were suggested that their indoor aviaries were
" dirty How sensitive Grass Parrakeets are to dirt is shown by a
case known to me of an aviculturist who for a time was quite success-
ful in keeping and breeding Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, until some
emergency obliged him temporarily to confine them in an aviary
occupied by a flock of young Budgerigars. The Budgerigars were

quite healthy, but the increased amount of droppings lying about
proved too much for the Blue-wings and soon practically the entire
lot were wiped out by eye-disease which is usually started by the
eyes, beak, and nostrils of a bird of a susceptible species coming
into contact with a soiled perch.
It is to aviculturists living in the warm parts of theUnited States
that we must look to save the Turquoisine and its allies. They have a
climate where it has been proved that the birds will thrive and breed,
and can be left out-of-doors the whole year round. All that is needed
is money for the construction of movable aviaries of the right size
and for the purchase of ground for the aviaries to stand on. May our
American friends show themselves alive to their opportunity before
it is too late !

By Captain H. S. Stokes
It is a blazing day in July : the sky a cloudless blue, the grass a
vivid green, trees in their full canopy of summer leaf, the water clear
and sparkling, the waterside foliage full grown and cool and luscious,
flower beds almost in their summer opulence, herbaceous borders full
of lacy gothic spires and minarets all composed of blue and purple
delphiniums ; roses smelling hot, pinks and honeysuckle pouring out
their scent. What more could the heart of man desire ? What ? And
I look lazily for an answer, and gratefully find it and give it.
Birds are the absolute completion of all this loveliness ; birds in
these surroundings, walking and swimming and flying and singing and
making love all around one.
Not birds in backyards in pens, caged up with sheets of rusty iron,
not birds away somewhere in a meadow in ugly unplanted aviaries,
range upon range and all alike ; but birds loose in the garden as part
of the landscape, birds on the stream, birds in aviaries in the garden,
each aviary a little garden in itself, and birds in cages hanging out for
an airing under old apple-trees on the lawn. It is not so very difficult
or unattainable ; there are two main requirements, a sense of proprotion
and an eye for beauty. Always aim at making your birds and garden

part and parcel of each other. Always make an aviary which is an
improvement to the garden and not an offence to the eye. Plant it so
that it has a character of its own ; let your small pool or bath, your
grass plot, your gravel or your paving be well balanced for size and
proportion and your birds will look ten times as lovely. Here we may
consider the question of shrubs and plants for aviaries, to which I have
given some thought. Aviaries enclosing brick or stone walls should
have climbing plants appropriate to those walls--ivy, large-leaved or
small, the common wild clematis called travellers' joy, golden hops,
climbing roses and syracantha. Ivy is not poisonous, for I have seen
my Rollers and Touracos eating whole leaves of it without ill effect.
Evergreens should include cupressus, box, Lonicera nitida, common
laurels, beneath whose leaves Gouldian Finches love to roost and keep
quite dry in storms, and the common white rhododendron, called
Cunningham's blush. The only drawback to rhododendrons is that
being calcifuge you cannot lime the ground round them. Yew is
poisonous to animals and should be avoided. The common bamboo
(Bambusa metake) does very well in aviaries and grows into good clumps,
but the more feathery species do not seem to stand the drip from the
roof wire. For this kasse, also Ancuba japonica, is bad. Deciduous
shrubs which are good are golden privet, syringa, and lilac.
The giant knotweed ( Polygonum sacchalieuse), herbaceous, and
growing some 7 feet high in the season, is good for summer shade and
to give an aspect of tropical luxuriance with its huge leaves. Grassy-
leaved plants are very important for the borders in front of the shrubs.
Many ground birds and most Whydahs like to nest in a tuft of grass.
Carex japonica pendula and the feathery wild Aira ccespitosa are good,
and have character, and the common montbretia, grown in large
clumps, is useful.
Parrakeets cannot be kept in planted aviaries, as they chew up
anything alive. For this reason I think it difficult to make Parrakeet
aviaries attractive. Modern authorities indeed banish all attractions
(except the birds) from them, and insist on movable aviaries and
absolute hygiene ; probably quite rightly from the point of view of
breeding rare Parrakeets from generation to generation, to preserve
them from extinction.

I notice with, some alarm, however, the same conditions now being
recommended for Sugar Birds and small Tanagers, and hope the day
will not come when we must have these lovely little creatures in movable
pens in a meadow, or not venture to keep them at all. Let us wander
round together and look at some of the birds. The Blue Mexican Jays
are busy making a nest, and their strength in breaking off quite big
live branches for it is amazing. If they mean business the other
insectivorous birds will have to be moved from their aviary, for I must
confess I have not enough self-restraint to keep only one pair of Soft-
bills in each aviary. And when that is done the hen will probably die
of egg-binding or the cock will eat the young. Sit and watch the Shamas
(the hen as well as the cock) pouring out their song from a honeysuckle
bush ; the Yellow-winged Sugar-birds enjoying a syringa in full flower,
the Senegal Touracos eating leaves from a crab-tree.
Some baby Falcated Duck and a bevy of Waders, Plover, Godwit,
Redshank,, and Wagtails are all busy paddling among the duckweed
of their little pond. Black-capped Fruit Pigeons are basking in the sun
with wing uplifted. Last year two pairs each reared a baby to ten days
old and then left it to die. This year, after planning precautions against
this, the tiresome creatures have not nested at all.
And now come round the garden with me. Let us sit under an old
hawthorn-tree on the bank of the stream and see the creatures pass
before us. A dog and a cat and, of course, the Trumpeter, are at our
side. You cannot ever go round the garden without the Trumpeter,
in fact, he now insists on coming into the house every day for tea.
The Demoiselle Cranes are so tame that they come almost up to us.
They seem to me the birds par excellence for any moderate sized garden.
Graceful and beautiful, not fierce or destructive to plants, hardy enough
to be out in all weathers, though on our cold clay soil we shut them up
on winter nights.
The four Flamingoes are indifferent to our presence. They pass
along in the water within a yard or two, working for food in the mud of
the stream, or tying their necks in knots to preen themselves, or
splashing vigorously to clean a foot before scratching their head with
it. Why do so few people keep Flamingoes ? Any muddy pond or
stream will make them happy; they sleep on the water and never

leave it. They are absolutely hardy, though they must be driven into
a stable in frosty weather or their slender legs will break on the ice. A
bucket of soaked bread and wheat and an occasional treat of shrimps
supply their needs. Mine now walk across the lawn and past the garage,
and put themselves to bed in the stable in winter, which shows that
Flamingoes are not nearly so stupid as they look.
Now look at the Ducks. Any garden with any water at all ought to
have Duck, even if only one pair. Other and abler pens have written
comprehensive articles on them, their habits and requirements, but let
me again urge their beauty and charm and amusing ways.
This is the time of year to think of starting Duck, for you want
hand-reared and pinioned young birds from a Duck-rearer, and not wild
caught ones imported in winter, which will be hopelessly wild and never
breed. Duck in a garden do not spoil or damage or deface their
surroundings with heavy wet paddling feet if you choose tbe right
sorts. They are rather apt to sit on waterside plants in the spring, but
this can be easily avoided by w T ire-netting only a foot high stretched
round the foliage groups, and the wire will soon be hidden by the growing
leaves.
Duck (except Tree Ducks) are absolutely hardy ; mine were out the
whole of last winter and seemed to enjoy it. The change from young
plumage in the drake to the smart and gorgeous full dress he assumes
in the first autumn, and the change back into eclipse plumage in July
after the breeding season are always a source of wonder and delight to
me. Nothing could be more charming than to go round the garden and
meet a pair of Mandarins or Carolinas busy slugging on the lawn, or
to watch a pair of Tufted Duck diving for their food. But let me warn
you to have the whole garden either netted or walled, for some Duck
like to wander, and especially in the breeding season will be off and away
without this precaution.
Tree Ducks are charming, too ; they become very tame and spend
much of their time walking on the lawns. They are not very hardy till
after their first winter in England, but are tame enough and sensible
enough to be driven into a stable for frosty weather. In spite of the
heat, I could go on rambling with you for hours, but you would certainly
get very bored, so I will stop !

NOTES FROM A LONDON AVIARY
By A. Sherriff

It may interest a few readers to hear-the results of a London aviary
during the last year.
In spite of the very severe winter all the birds (a mixed collection)
did very well, and losses were mainly confined to one or two small
seed-eaters and a cock Blue Sugar Bird which was killed, it is feared,
by a cock Black-headed Sugar Bird.
As usual the first birds to show any signs of breeding were Chinese
Painted Quails, which started laying eggs in the middle of March.
Long-tailed Grassfinches had. three young ones out of the nest by the
end of April, and are doing well. The Long-tailed Grassfinches, Red-
beaked variety Pcephila acuticaudata (Jiecki) have been to nest twice,
and in both cases unfortunately the eggs have been clear.
The Long-tailed Grassfinches have had to be separated from
Gouldians and Parrot Finches, not because they were quarrelsome, but
because they have a habit of taking possession of any other nest as
sleeping quarters. Parrot Finches are sitting at the moment, and
should hatch any day. The Gouldians, however, are only just showing
signs of wanting to breed as they have really only just got over the
moult.
Black-headed Sibias incubated one clear egg, which was most
disappointing. There are four of these birds in the aviary, the original
pair and two young ones, which were bred two years ago. Owing to
an oversight, the young birds were never rung, and it is impossible to
tell the parents from the young birds. They have now arrived at a
point where two of them refuse to live together. For fighting they are
amazing. The two birds in question, if allowed to meet, will drop
to the ground clasped together by their claws, and have to be separated
by hand. It is a strange thing, because as a rule they have always
been most sociable.
Red-whiskered Bulbuls sat for seventeen days on four eggs, but
owing to their nervousness did not incubate properly, and the eggs
were addled.
A pair of Shamas have now got one young bird about nine days old.

Out of the first nest two young ones were hatched, but it is feared
were killed by the mother. She had on a previous occasion murdered
her young.
One of the biggest disappointments was the nest of the Black-
headed Sugar Bird. There are no records of this bird having bred in
captivity. They ate in perfect condition, and about a month ago were
placed in a very large aviary with plenty of undergrowth with a pair
of Shamas and the Bulbuls mentioned above.
Excited antics on the part of the cock aroused the idea that there
was a nest somewhere, but at no time had the hen been seen to be
carrying any nesting material, although she had been provided with
plenty.
After careful searching a nest was found about 5 feet off the ground
in the fork of a young plane-tree. It consisted at the base of cotton-
wool and the cup was made of fine fibre which is provided by unravelling
coarse hemp and rope and cutting it into small lengths. The nest was
not lined in any way, although hair, etc., was available. The cup was
very shallow, and did not measure more than 3 inches across. Two
eggs were laid with an interval of one day between the first and the
second. The hen sat very close, and on the 13th morning, one young
one was hatched, but through some carelessness on the part of the
hen the young one fell out of the nest. Apparently unhurt, it was
replaced ; the other egg had not yet hatched. It might be mentioned
here that the pair of Shamas had been transferred to another aviary,
and only the Bulbuls remained. In the afternoon the other egg had
disappeared, and although the shell was found later, only one dead
youngster could be traced. This was covered with a blackish grey
down. The eggs were about three-quarters of an inch long, pinkie white,
with a fair number of brown spots.
For three or four days nothing further appeared to be happening,
the Bulbuls were removed, and it was decided to allow the Sugar Birds
a week to see if they showed any further signs of going to nest. After
five days a nest within 9 inches of the previous one was noticed ; this
time, incidentally, the cup was much deeper and the hen is now sitting
tight on two eggs. Perhaps this time she may be successful.
There are no other birds in the aviary with the exception of a pair

of Quails with one young one. Four of these birds were hatched, but
three died after three days. Is it on account of the difficulty of obtaining
tiny insects that the first week of the young Quail's life is so precarious ?
At any rate the remaining one is doing very well indeed, and it is
amusing to watch it sitting next to the hen, who is again incubating.
It may be of interest to mention here that last year a pair of Blue
Sugar Birds went to nest twice, but on both occasions the eggs were
clear. The nest and eggs were very similar to those of the Black-headed
Sugar Bird with the exception that the nest was carefully lined with
hair. Unfortunately, although there are two hens in the collection,
it is impossible to get another cock. The nest in this case was built
in a pyramid bay-tree about 3 ft. off the ground.
With regard to the Parrots a pair of Bed-rumped Parakeets made
an attempt to breed, but the cock died suddenly, and although the
hen continued to sit, nothing resulted. Exactly the same thing occurred
in the case of a pair of Stanleys.
Emerald-spotted Tanagers have been given an aviary to them-
selves, and, although no sign of nesting has yet been shown, there is
still time. These birds are extraordinarily pretty, and very lively
indeed. They appear to be quite harmless with other birds, unlike
some of the Tanagers, and are a most welcome addition to the aviary.
A pair of Orange-headed Ground Thrushes are nesting, and the
hen has been sitting on two eggs for a week now.
In the mixed aviary a Bengal Pitta, presumably a hen, has been
spending all its time making nests in odd places.
This bird has been in the aviary now about four years, and has
always been together with an African Roller. For many months,
whenever the Roller came to the ground for mealworms, the Pitta
would fly at him until the Roller flew off the ground. Now, however,
they are close friends.
Perhaps some one else may be tempted to let us hear their breeding
accounts, as, apart from the general interest, they are so often of
great help.
Does continuous dry weather, such as we have experienced this
year, have any effect on the fertility of eggs ?

Mr. Arthur Prestwich has produced a very useful little volume in
Who&amp;apos;s Who in Aviculture, for all of us like to know something about
others who follow the same bent as ourselves. This is the first series,
and contains short accounts of a large number of aviculturists. It is not
complete, many names having been omitted, as was inevitable in a
first venture of the kind, but it is hoped that all who consider themselves
aviculturists, but whose names have not been included, will com-
municate with the Editor (Mr. Prestwich), so that this may be made as
complete a volume of reference as possible. It is published by the
Avicultural Book Club, Winsor, Southampton, at the moderate price
of 2s. 9d. post free.

CORRESPONDENCE
QUEEN OF BAVABIA CONUBES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974082" page_id="56215987"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I find that I am compelled to get rid of my Queen of Bavaria
Conures, owing to their tiresome and vicious habits, and wonder if there
is any member in England or abroad who would like to have them,
being in a position to exploit their good qualities and cope with their
bad ones ?
They are two true pairs, thoroughly acclimatized, and one couple
have been seen to mate. The cocks are perfect specimens, but both hens
are inveterate feather-pluckers, and one cannot fly, never having grown
her flight quills after the cut stumps were removed. The feather-
plucking started through my keeping the birds on mixed seed for too
long after their arrival instead of getting them on to plain canary at
the earliest possible moment, which seems necessary in the case of this
species. When they have denuded themselves the hens are inclined to
start on their mates, but the cocks do not pluck themselves. On&amp;
pair I trained with very little trouble as liberty birds, and they behaved
admirably as far as staying went, returning every night to roost in their
aviary shelter, never leaving the garden, and doing no noticeable
damage to the trees. I should doubtless have cured the hen and
probably got them to breed had they behaved decently to the other
aviaries and their inmates, but instead of living in the trees they would

spend their time on the aviaries yelling at any Parrots or Parrakeets
that excited their curiosity or dislike and destroying the woodwork
round the windows of their aviary shelters. Though arrant cowards
with any bird at liberty that stood up to them, they finally became very
vicious with timid birds that could not fly well, attacking them as they
were climbing the wire. After they had mutilated an Amazon and killed
a nestling Crimson-wing, I had to shut them up and no doubt the hen
will recommence plucking more furiously than ever ! They were
terribly costly birds to buy, and are a great disappointment, confirming
the already low opinion I had of the Conure genus ! In their favour it
maybe said that they are extremely pretty on the wing, and do not seem
to take any notice of non-psittacine birds, nor, of course, can they injure
aviary birds that can fly well. It is possible, therefore, that someone
with no vulnerable aviary stock might do really well with the full-
winged pair, and derive much pleasure from them. Something might
be done with the second pair, if treatment could promote the growth
of the hen's primaries on the defective side, her other quills being healthy
and normal. The two pairs will not, however, agree.

Sir, --Anent the letter from Mr. Lee S. Crandall, which appeared
in the Avicultural Magazine for June, Mr. Crandall takes exception
to a sentence in an article by me in which I am made to say that there
are only 150 species of birds " in any of the American Zoos This
should, of course, read " in many of the American Zoos ". I trust that
no English aviculturist has been misled by this obvious error. I should
like to take this opportunity of congratulating Mr. Crandall on his
success in landing safely so many varieties. Also Mr. Shaw Mayer--
whose birds I have had the pleasure of seeing--for bringing what must

The subject of the accompanying plate was presented to the
Zoological Society by Mr. J. Spedan Lewis on 29th November, 1928,
having been brought to this country from the Malay Peninsula by
Mr. Walter Goodfellow. So far as I am aware, it is the only example of
any species of the order Eurylcemiformes, or Broadbills, that has been
imported.
The Broadbills are confined to the Oriental Region, the chief
characteristic features of the group being the very broad and flat
bill, short tarsi, and large and strong feet.
Most of the Broadbills are insectivorous, but the Green Broadbill
(Calyptomena viridis) is an exception to the general rule, being almost
engirely frugivorous.
The coloured plate renders a description of the adult male
unnecessary, but it may be mentioned that the female differs in the
absence of the black markings on the plumage, which is duller through-
out. The nest is said to be an elongated bag-shaped structure of dead
leaves and interwoven fibre suspended from a bough over water, the
\0x25A0eggs being creamy white in colour and two to a clutch.
C. viridis occurs in Tenasserim, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and
Borneo. In the Malay Peninsula, according to Robinson, it is common
in secondary and old jungle up to about 3,000 feet, going about in
small parties of six or seven which keep well amongst the branches.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
The breeding season which is now drawing to a close has been a
poor one, nothing new and interesting having materialized, while some
of the old reliable breeding pairs have done less well than usual. The
summer rate of death and sickness from enteritis and pneumonia has
been more than ever depressing, no bird being too hardy or too
thoroughly acclimatized to be proof against the combined malice of
X and the June climate of Warblington ! The cock Guilding's Amazon,
an old breeding hen Crimson-wing, mother of my Alexandra hybrid ;
a breeding pair of Barrabands ; a cock Layard and a Sula Island King
X Crimson-wing hybrid are among the victims. Only a degree
less tiresome is it when X gets his knife into a bird that has been through
one moult in an outdoor aviary and seems acclimatized, with the result
that it can only be kept in a cage in the birdroom and becomes
dangerously ill every time you try to get it back in an aviary. Last
spring I had a lovely pair of Derbyan Parrakeets which I had had out
for eight months and which had never ailed since their arrival. In
due course they came into breeding condition, and the chances of a
medal looked rosy. Then early one morning I found the hen lying dead
on the ground in a corner of the flight. Post mortem examination
revealed no trace of injury, no sign of disease, and eggs were already
well formed in her ovary. Later in the year I got a freshly imported
hen, but in July the cock fell ill. When he had completely recovered I
tried him in another aviary and he again got ill. If he has to be caged
all winter he will, of course, be useless for breeding next spring. The
same thing has happened with a cock Alexandra Parrakeet but as I
have no mate for him it does not so much matter.
My old Grey Parrot, a former pet of the late Canon Dutton, has-

once laid eggs in a cage. She is now in a small outdoor aviary and as, in
May, she began scratching on the ground I gave her a log. She laid
two eggs in it and incubated them steadily. When they were due to
hatch I gave her a fertile Yellow-rump's egg. She was much excited
when the young bird emerged, but injured it a day later, confirming
previous experience that old maids among Parrots make bad foster-
mothers. Soon afterwards she laid and incubated a second clutch of
eggs and I then removed the nest. There is little doubt that G-rey
Parrots would be very easy to breed if cocks were less scarce and people
less unwilling to give them a chance of nesting. The Lutino Blue-
fronted Amazon once more disappointed me, or rather her mate did.
This cock, when introduced to her nearly two years ago, tried hard to
make himself agreeable. She, however, was persistently rude to him.
He never forgave her, and ultimately turned so spiteful with her that
I had to keep his wing partly cut. I hoped that time might heal the
breach but it was no good. Sometimes he would get her to do his hair
for him but he made it quite clear that this service was rendered in a
strictly professional capacity and was not in any sense to be interpreted
as a sign of affection : he would still turn on her without warning, and
she was afraid of him. Finally I removed him, much to her relief and
gave him away as a cage pet. I had another cock in reserve, but he was
a spiritless creature, slow in moulting and much oppressed by the horse-
play of the lively iemale with him. I relieved him of his boisterous
partner, but he is one of those poor creatures who are born to trouble,
for some enemy caught him climbing up the wire (he cannot yet fly)
and bit the ends off some of his toes, since when he has not dared to
show his head outside the shelter. I have found him a good home
where considerate human friends will, I hope, make him forget his past
sorrows, and I am promised another cock reputed to be well disposed
towards matrimony.
Roseate Cockatoos were another failure. I have a breeding hen
and a white bird supposed to be a cock. They never properly took to
their nest, and an egg dropped from the perch was the only approach
to breeding. The sex of the white specimen puzzles me, as its appearance
and behaviour both provide conflicting evidence.

deserved punishment I recorded in "De gustibus," remained uncivil and
unrepentant when put back in the spring with the wife he so nearly
murdered. Had his wing not been cut he would have finished the job
there and then and a second clipping was necessary some weeks later
when the moult restored some of his flight feathers. However in July
he at last reformed and at the time of writing he is again a model
husband and a devoted father to three fat babies quickly growing in the
nest. A more unlikely breeding pair did not exist in my collection. The
hen is very old (I received her as an adult thirteen years ago), and she
has never flown very well since the almost fatal mauling the cock gave
her on being returned to her after a few days' separation last autumn.
The cock mysteriously lost the use of two back toes on one foot early in
the winter and he very nearly starved to death as a result of a bad
injury to his tongue sustained in two days' incessant and wholly
unnecessary fighting when given his liberty at Christmas. He was ill
for weeks, and for a time was reduced to a skeleton.
The Turquoisine Parrakeets I have dealt with in another article.
They have hatched two out of five eggs and reared the young ones ;
the latter are much stronger than last year's nestling at the same age,
and are rapidly improving, but one is not all that one could wish and
I am looking forward to the time when a change will make it safe to
allow them an aviary and healthy outdoor conditions. The old hen,
it may be worth noting, has a few partly red feathers in her wing
where the cock's bar would be. I have seen fertile hen Redrumps with
a trace of red on the back and fertile hen Zebra Finches with an
indication of the dark bib and chestnut cheek patches and I once had
a Gouldian Finch in full male plumage that laid an egg.
The Black Cockatoos provide the last ray of hope of an exciting
event, though the lateness of the season is all against it. For the first
time in seventeen years one pair have actually mated and the hen,
who has laid and incubated before, seems about to lay again. She was
formerly the property of a Mrs. Anningson, who exhibited her with
success at many shows in what is now the quite distant past 1 She is
a magnificent specimen of the big race, C. megalorlnyncus. When
caged she laid regularly and she also laid and sat in a flight
cage when she was being kept for me by Canon Dutton during

the war. Since being put into a big aviary she has only once
looked like laying, and then changed her mind at the last moment.
" Max," her husband, I got from the late Mr. Carl Hagenbeck
before the war and for a short time kept as a liberty bird at my
old home. Unfortunately, later, while on deposit at the Zoological
Gardens, he contracted the vice of feather plucking, which he has never
since abandoned. As a Black Cockatoo will only eat hemp, sunflower,
and monkey-nuts, it is impossible to modify its diet with a view to a
cure. He is a Western bird, C. stellatus, and so is much smaller than his
companion. His domestic interests have not in any way spoiled his
temper, and he is as absurdly demonstrative as ever to his human friends.
A new specimen I received recently, which is believed to be a young
male, eats apples as greedily as any Parrot, which affords another
instance of the strange way in which birds of the same species differ
in their tastes. Not one of the thirteen other Black Cockatoos I have-
owned at different times would ever touch fruit. As tastes vary, so do-
temperaments. For example, I have had many breeding pairs of
Redrumps, and all of them used to turn spiteful with their young very
soon after they had flown. This year I got a new pair to try as liberty
birds. They were an odd couple, and very wild ; yet almost the day
they were released they rushed to a hollow tree in a garden half a mile
nearer the town, on the edge of the main road, and, with the precipitancy
of Lovebirds, laid eggs and brought up two daughters, while motor-
buses and traffic of all sorts thundered past them. Although their
children have been flying quite two months, they still feed with them
on the same tray in perfect harmony and good fellowship.
My Palm Cockatoos are much improved by a summer in the open
air, and the cock, who was for some time a rather dull and anaemic-
looking specimen, now has fine red cheeks and has recovered his spirits.
Although his best friend could not call him beautiful, there is really a
good deal to be said for Microglossus aterrimus as an aviary bird. His
actions when in good health are as weird as his appearance, which, like
that of a Hornbill, is almost too good to be true. He is easy to feed
and, according to American aviculturists, capable of standing a good
deal of cold. He is very gentle with other birds, less destructive than
most Cockatoos and less noisy, his voice, which he does not use except

in moments of excitement or glee, resembling that of a kitchen-maid
when similarly elated.
Last spring a long-cherished ambition was most unexpectedly
gratified when I became the owner of a specimen of the largest and
rarest of the true Parrots--the splendid Imperial Amazon. On first
arrival I was not too happy about the prospects of life of my new
treasure. He showed a certain weakness in getting on to the perch,
and shelled large quantities of monkey-nuts without eating them,
appearing more interested in the husk than in the kernel. However
matters soon improved when I put some turf and branches in his cage.
He chewed up and ate an almost incredible quantity of bark and twigs
for which his system was evidently craving and afterwards his appetite
became normal and he fed well on my usual seed mixture with a liberal
allowance of apple. As he gained in strength he became much livelier,
uttering a melancholy whistle which for a time I attributed to the
Barnards in the same room and climbing about the cage looking
incessantly for a way of escape. All the big Island Amazons are unsuited
to cage life, but I never saw one who more obviously pined for greater
liberty than the Imperial. When the weather permitted I turned him
into one of the 24 ft. movable aviaries, where he has done well and is
now more than half through the moult. For the benefit of those who
are not familiar with a coloured plate of the species, I may say that
the head, neck, and breast are dark lilac-purple, each feather having
a blackish tip ; the wings and back are green, the eye a fiery orange and
the tail chocolate-purple tinged with green and tipped with lilac. My
bird has a habit of erecting the feathers at the back of the head in a
fashion which recalls the appearance of a Harpy Eagle. He now utters
a great variety of calls ; some natural; others apparently an imitation
of those of his neighbours, while he also carries on long conversations
in unintelligible gibberish in mimicry of the human voice. Though not
exactly wild, he is rather nervous, and although he will sometimes
display when spoken to, he hurries into the shelter if anyone enters the
aviary. Like most Parrots, he greatly dislikes hot sun. Although his
present quarters are large enough to keep him in good health, he still
seems to wish for greater freedom and I hope one day to give him a
big aviary where he can really use his wings.

A pair of Bed-crowned Hanging Parrots are another addition to
my collection. I had not intended to get any more of this genus until
I moved to a healthier district, but when they were sent on approval
I was tempted by their beauty and fine condition and so far they have
done well. They are charming little mites and decidedly smaller than
any Parrot-like bird I have ever seen alive. The general plumage is
green, with a slight yellowish-brown wash on the mantle. The back
is red, as also is a spot on the throat and a neat, round cap on the
front of the crown. There is a touch of orange-red at the bend of the
wing ; the beak is small and black, the iris whitish, and the legs carroty-
yellow. The hen lacks the red on the crown, and her throat-spot is
very small. I am, by the way, puzzled by these red-headed Hanging
Parrots. I have a distinct recollection of seeing at the Zoo Sanatorium
quite a big specimen (imported, I think, by Mr. Frost) which was
supposed to be a Bed-capped, but which was the size of an Abyssinian
Lovebird or thereabouts ; my present pair are far smaller : can the
Editor enlighten me ?
My birds are fed on Horlick's malted milk, Mellin's food, honey,
and grapes, and seem to do well on the mixture. The use of Nestle's
milk as a substitute for Horlick's I have found most disastrous both
for Hanging Parrots and small Lorikeets, resulting sooner or later in
fatty degeneration of the kidneys or fits. The Bed-crowns are reasonably
tame and steady. Their cry is a gentle sibilant twittering, and the hen,
as is usual with the genus, is very much the master, and decidedly
disagreeable to her mate. In an aviary containing Hanging Parrots
the grass must always be kept short, or they may try to bathe in the
dew-laden herbage and get hopelessly tangled up and chilled. They are
purely arboreal birds, and very clumsy on the ground, which they would
never visit unless induced to do so by the lack of the leafy branches
in which they are accustomed to perform their ablutions in a
wild state.
Another interesting addition has been a Slatey-headed Parrakeet
(P. schisticejps), kindly given me by Mr. Ezra. It is a great pity that this
very beautiful and presumably hardy species, common over a wide
area of northern India, is never imported. In appearance it resembles
a rather large, pale Plum-headed Parrakeet, with the head leaden

instead of plum-coloured. I find that Indian field naturalists have
libelled its voice, which, they describe as harsh, just as they have
unduly flattered the Malabar by calling its cries musical. The call of
the Slatey-head is a pleasant musical " Tweet ", very like that of the
Plum-head. Talking of Malabars, I have discovered the interesting
fact that the cock gets his full plumage with the first complete moult,
and not, as is usual with Eingnecks, with the second. His beak under-
goes a strange series of colour-changes--red when he leaves the nest;
black a few months later, and back to red by his first spring. Young
hens start with red beaks, and then change to black and remain so.
Small Finches at liberty, released for the first time, have stayed
better than usual, a fact which I attribute in part to the covering of
some of the seed dishes with " dish-covers " of inch-mesh netting, which
allows them to feed in peace undisturbed by bigger English birds.
Common, Sr. Helena, Orange-breasted, and Orange-cheeked Waxbills,
Cordon Bleus, Fire Finches, Lavender Finches, Bib Finches, Zebra
Finches, Avadavats, Silver-bills, Orange Weavers, and Eainbow
Buntings are all to be seen in the garden, and seem thoroughly settled
down.
Of Common Waxbills I had a nice little flock left from last year,
when they bred. They were wintered in an aviary with a heated shelter
and outside flight. I only lost one, and there are a good many still
about, and more young are appearing. I had very bad luck with my
Fire Finches, of which I bred quite a number last autumn. The hens
in winter I shut up with the Common Waxbills, while the cocks were
treated as day-liberty birds. In late May I had seven or eight hens in
lovely condition and about the same number of cocks. When the
nights as well as the days were warm I let out the hens and within a
week all but one were picked up dead in the garden or in the aviary
shelters, to which they still had access. Some miserable half-plucked
new arrivals, fresh from the dealers, kept perfectly well, and are now
breeding !
Disaster also overtook my liberty-bred Lavender Finches, of which
I was very proud. One of the trap feeding trays which ought to have
been closed at mid-day to force the small birds to enter the aviary
shelters for the night, got out of shape, allowing the Lavender Finches

to enter and feed. They stayed out on a cold winter night, and next
morning the ground outside the entrance to the aviary shelter was
strewn with sad little corpses. They had struggled there in a chilled
state at dawn, and died almost immediately and more than half the
flock perished.
Bib Finches have done quite well as day-liberty birds in winter
and at complete liberty in summer. A certain number stray, but enough
remain to keep up the stock; they are nice little things and in spite of
their sober plumage are much in evidence. They and their cousins the
Silver-bills have an extraordinary habit of eating the dead buds on the
elm pea-sticks, cut about six months ago.
A pair of Avadavats built a very conspicuous nest in a myrtle on
the verandah close to the dining-room window. In spite of people
constantly passing and the frequent use of the bush as a bicycle-rest
by my children, the young were reared. A hen Cuban Finch has
provided a curious example of the way in which despised and unvalued
birds will survive and flourish. I bought her last August (1928) with
some that I wanted to send to a friend abroad, but she was such a
miserable specimen that I had to keep her. She was half-plucked ;
very lame, and bumble-footed and breathed as though she had chronic
asthma. As the weather was hot, I let her have her liberty. From her
infirmities she was stupidly tame and sat about day after day on the
top of an aviary or in conspicuous places on the lawn. How she escaped
a thousand deaths at the hand of cats, rats, owls, and wood-mice I
cannot imagine. But she lived and improved, and by the time the cold
weather came was in fair condition. Through the severe winter nothing
ailed her, nor did prudence desert her, and she returned nightly to her
safe and warm roost. When I left home in May I bade her, as I thought,
farewell, for it was not to be expected that an unmated bird would stay
through the summer. However, on my return in August, there she still
was, and when I watched the Waxbills feeding yesterday evening the
Cuban Finch did not fail to arrive for her dinner. She really deserves
a husband, though no small bird as quarrelsome as the Cuban with its
own species is well suited to liberty aviculture owing to the fighting
that takes place when the birds are shut up on winter afternoons in
the roosting shelter.

A matter of between four and five thousand miles away and a
three weeks' journey from the shores of England lies the world's most
incredible island. It is one of those places of which, when one
enthusiastically describes it to a friend, one is conscious that, though
they listen tolerantly, they take all one says with the proverbial grain
of salt. Seen for the first time from the sea, one is struck by its sinister
and awe-inspiring grandeur. Imagine an island about the same size
and shape as the Isle of Man, with all the highest mountains of the British
Isles crushed up and put upon it--though several of the peaks there are
higher than those of our islands--rising sheer out of the sea, their feet
resting in the water and their summits hidden by the clouds, the only
place I know of where palm-trees thrive above the mists, striving to add
a still greater height to the already great towering volcanic peaks. If
you can imagine this and a hundred other things, then you have
Dominica, the fairest and yet the least known of the Leeward Islands
in the Caribbean Sea. Its visitors are few, but its hospitality is second
to none in the world--perhaps the former is the reason for the latter !
It is perhaps appropriate that this wonderful island should be the
home of one of the world's rarest birds, the Imperial Parrot (Amazona
imperialis), which for some years has been thought to be nearly
extinct; and the chief reason for my visiting the island was to ascertain
whether this singular bird was still alive. Fortunately for ornithologists,
it is, but unless special care is taken its days are numbered.
For many years I had cherished in my mind a desire, or I might say
a vague hope, that one day I might be able to find out something definite
concerning the fate of either one or more of the rare and supposedly
nearly extinct Parrots which inhabit the more remote West Indian

Islands. I did not think that such, a desire would materialize, and it was
only by a series of extraordinary coincidences that it eventually did,
and with what luck I will relate later on.
When I set sail at the beginning of February, after several months
of indifferent health, in search of sunshine in Jamaica, I had not the
slightest intention of ever setting foot in the lovely island of Dominica,
but it was in this latter country that I did eventually arrive, and not
in the former. I will explain. Our boat which was bound for Barbados,
the jumping off ground for passengers bound for the lesser known West
Indian Islands, carried as passengers several residents of the Lesser
Antilles, who were returning after a trip to Europe, and as I got to
know them I questioned them about the rare Parrots from the
respective islands. But few of them knew anything about the birds
except the Parrot from St. Vincent, which they regarded more or less
as a myth ; but two days before landing at Barbados I was introduced
to a charming lady who resided on Dominica, and who knew Amazona
imperialis well. She said that it had always been very scarce, but now
it was excessively rare. It used to be shot and eaten by the natives in
fair quantities, and that even now it was occasionally shot and eaten
by them (a fact which I later on proved to be only too true), and some-
times when a bird was slightly wounded in the wing or leg it was taken
by the natives and sold. Such a specimen was brought to this lady's
sister the year before last by a native, from whom she purchased it.
I understand that it was wounded in the wing ; in fact, the part from
the elbow had been shot away. It was kept in a large cage, made out
of a packing-case, but appeared sullen and morose. It was sold by
her later at a good price to an American institution, of which she could
not remember the name. I asked this lady whether it were possible to
secure examples, but she said that there was no royal road to get them,
and it was only by the rarest luck that the natives got hold of them,
for there was no way of snaring them or procuring the young as the
birds nest in the highest forest trees which are quite inaccessible,
though upon one occasion she heard of a tree being felled which
contained a nest of fully fledged youngsters. So upon this information
I decided to alter all my arrangements, and come to the island and try
my luck at either securing a specimen, or, at least, seeing these

magnificent birds in a state of freedom. Fortunately I was able to do
both.
Upon landing I was introduced to the lady's brother, who, with
true colonial hospitality at once offered to lend me his old home which
was situated in the remote part of the island where these birds still
exist; in fact, it was the only house in the vicinity, and nearby lived
the only hunter who knew and was familiar with the birds in their
breeding haunts. Anyone else landing in the island in quest of the bird
would have a very remote chance of meeting with the bird unless he
had the same good luck that I had. Often people in the island will
tell you that the bird still exists, but they don't know where. They
will say when questioned : 44 Oh away in the forests," but as the island
is covered with forest this does not imply very much. In fact, there are
very few people in the island who have ever seen even a captured one,
and I think that within recent years practically no white man has seen
one wild except myself. The old hunter took me and after three hours
of the roughest climbing I have ever done or hope to do again, brought
me to the tree where the birds were.
As soon as I arrived at my destination after having spent several
days in Roseau, the tiny but charming capital of the island, I naturally
made inquiries regarding the whereabouts of the Parrots. The natives
all knew of the birds, but I was told that I had come at the wrong time
of the year, for the birds were already far away breeding in the deepest
recesses of the mountain forest, in parts which were inaccessible to
human beings. This sounded far from hopeful, but at night the old
native hunter already mentioned turned up and told me that he was
the only man in the district who really knew all about the " Ciceroo ",
which is the native name for the bird. He informed me that if I
liked to go for a two or three days' journey through the forests with
him he would show me dozens of the birds, but if I only wanted to see
one or two it would be only necessary to make a day's journey. Now
finding that the natives of Dominica are singularly honest and truthful,
differing in that respect very much from their cousins in Africa, I had
no reason to doubt his word which in every way proved correct. I
decided on the latter alternative, so on the second morning after we
set out. I have undertaken some rough trekking in my time, but this.

beat everything I have ever done. No wonder Amazona impenalis was
thought to be extinct or at least nearly so. The way lay for the most
part up and down almost perpendicular cliffs of about 1,000 feet high,
and these were covered with the densest tropical vegetation. I think
that we used our hands more than our feet: many times I nearly gave
up, but just as my lungs seemed bursting and my strength almost
gone we would reach the top and the descent would give me strength
for the next climb. Sometimes we had to follow the course of a rushing
mountain river, struggling to get from one boulder to another. On
and on we pushed, sometimes there was a few minutes' rest when the
guide was hacking out a pathway with his cutlass from the dense
undergrowth. My face and hands were cut and bleeding from contact
with the sharp razor-grass, and the going was made more difficult by
the fact that the heavy red soil stuck to one's boots and made walking
exceptionally trying.
The great forests were singularly destitute of animal life ; large
yellow and brown land crabs which hurried up the trees as we passed,
and occasional specimens of Bouquet's Parrot ( Amazona houqueti )
were the only signs of life. At last the guide informed me that we
were in the district and sure enough in a few minutes we heard the
loud ringing crys of A. imperialis and two birds flew out of a huge
forest tree, circling round with almost motionless wings, looking very
much like small eagles and very dark in colour when silhouetted against
the sky. A little later on we came across another pair feeding upon
a great fruit-bearing forest tree. I cannot describe the thrill as I lay
upon my back on the hot steamy mould, gazing up at the birds through
my binoculars ; I realized that a long-desired wish had at last
materialized, and I wondered how few white people had ever seen or
perhaps ever would see these magnificent birds, undisturbed in the
solitude of their wonderful forest home. Only a keen naturalist
will understand my feelings when, after travelling thousands of miles,
I beheld these creatures which had long been thought to be extinct.
I felt somehow like Wallace did when he first saw and handled the
King Bird of Paradise (Gicinnurus regius ) as so well described in his
wonderful book The Malay Archipelago. All my fatigue vanished
and I did not feel the cuts and bruises.

The cock of the pair fed on the fruit, continually letting fall half-
eaten ones which somewhat resembled a very dark purplish
pomegranate. This fruit has a vile taste when eaten in the unripe
state in which the birds appear to like it; even if only touched by
the tongue it leaves a horribly bitter and astringent taste in the mouth
for a long time afterwards. When quite ripe the outer peel splits
into five sections and opens out like a star, thus exposing the interior
which looks like a small grape-fruit with the peel and skin removed ;
also when quite ripe it loses some of its terribly astringent taste.
Though I tried the bird which I later on secured with it, and also the
Bouquet's Parrots, they all refused to touch it. This was exceedingly
strange as it forms the main food of both birds in the wild state.
The hen of the pair I was watching (the guide said that it was the
hen, though I could see no difference between the two) ran slowly up
and down a bare branch of creeper which hung between the two trees,
so that I got a splendid view of her. She struck me as being very
dark purple, the head looked small and Vulture-like, and half the tail
seemed to have been broken away. This may have been due to the
fact that she was nesting.
My guide told me that two months previously he had a pair of
these birds which he had shot. One, which was badly wounded,
died in a few days, but the other one, being merely stunned, recovered
and he kept it for several weeks, but there being no prospective buyer
in the district (I believe I was the only visitor who had stayed for
any length of time in that part for some years) and the bird being very
fat, my black friend cut its throat and had it for the evening meal.
I nearly said I wished it had choked him, but if it had done so I should
never have seen A . imperialis in its wild state! Some weeks after this
trip I was speaking to a native hunter and he said, " Law or no law,
we shall always shoot the ' Ciceroo ' when we can, we pay a licence
for a gun and if we go hunting and find no wild pig or agouti and we
see a c Ciceroo ' we just shoot it because we have no meat." I
mentioned about keeping fowls as a constant supply of meat, but the
answer was, " Fowls cost money to buy and we can always sell them,
but we can't sell a ' Ciceroo '."

the utter grandeur of the deep, almost inaccessible forest-covered
gorges and ravines which form the home of the Imperial Parrot. It
requires an artist in words to paint a pen picture that will in the
slightest degree convey anything of the magnificence of the mountain
ranges of Dominica. I have seen a good many groups of wild and
rugged mountain ranges in Europe and elsewhere, but none have ever
appeared so impressive as those which form the home of the " Ciceroo
Nowhere do mountains rise so sheer or are the ravines so deep and
precipitous. Sometimes the walls of the gorges rise perpendicularly
for thousands of feet, covered by the densest tropical creepers and
ferns of the most vivid emerald green. From the distance the island
looks like a jagged emerald rising up out of the turquoise sea. The
rainfall in some parts is as much as three hundred inches a year and
this, combined with an average temperature of about 85* F., gives
a wealth of tropical vegetation which can well be imagined. Giant
palms and tree-ferns mix with the other vegetation in the struggle
upwards towards the light. Here and there great forest giants lie
prone, their great bulk almost hidden by the rank growth of mosses,
etc. It is here, in some places impossible for man to penetrate, on
the Atlantic slopes of the sinister volcanic peak, Morne Diablotin
(Mountain of the Devil) that A. imperialis makes its home. Long
may it hold its own.
Of course, the Imperial Parrot is rightly protected by law, but as
a gentleman in the Administration said to me, it is absolutely impossible-
to enforce the law in such a district. The only laws known in those-
parts are the laws of Nature. But the bird is protected by Nature
in such a way as no other creature in the world is, for I know of no^
living bird whose numbers are as small as those of A. imperialis and
yet which has managed to maintain itself as this bird has. Its home-
is the most remote, the most inaccessible, and the approach the most
dangerous that I know of. All this may sound rather ludicrous when-
the island is only about 15 miles by 30, but the position must be seen
to be appreciated.
I believe that this species will not be exterminated for some years-
to come, that is if great care is taken and no one is allowed to collect
an unlimited number of specimens, especially for museums, in the-

United States. I am not speaking disparagingly of American institu-
tions, but there is a tendency to stock the museums in the States with
rare specimens, which is only natural, as most of the museums in
Europe which have been established for a much longer time are already
full. The species in the flesh is far more valuable to the coming
generations than dried skins in cabinets, even though the birds live in
inaccessible forests.
I regret to say that when they stray away from their natural home
the birds are still shot by the native gunners now and then for food.
This is a great shame, for I hear that the flesh of these birds is very
tough and leathery. I was asked to sample the flesh of one of these
birds, but even had I not been a vegetarian I should have refused.
It is a great pity that they are eaten, for there is an abundance of food
on the island, but the natives have no idea of the rarity of the species.

In the administration of a public Zoological Garden the needs for the
successful breeding of birds must generally be subservient to the
adequate exhibition of the various species. In this respect the Giza
Zoological Gardens were no exception.
During the period under review an average of some 1,400 birds of
230 different forms was maintained in the aviaries and paddocks.
Most of the aviaries devoted to the smaller birds were large with a
portion covered in and a service passage at the rear and contained
a mixed population. Some had cemented pools with a constant supply
of running water, others pools in which the water was changed from
time to time. Shrubs and small trees, planted directly in the floor
or in wooden tubs, were provided. There were ranges of smaller,
movable aviaries for Parrots and pairs of Finches, etc., all in the open.
Two pairs of Beautiful Starlings (Spreo &amp;apos;pulcher ) reared several

broods, one of six was hatched on 22nd May. They nested two or three
times between mid-April and September. The clutches never exceeded
six eggs and four was the usual complement. The nests were built
in boxes. These birds did not tolerate smaller species in their domain
and, though excellent parents so long as their offspring were dependent
upon them, preferred their room to their company when the young
oould fend for themselves.
A pair of Common Mynahs ( Acridotheres tristis) hatched four young
on 24th June from a nest built in a box.
By the end of January, Brown-naped Fire-Finches ( Lagonostica
senegala brunneiceps), African Waxbills ( Aidemosyne c. cantans),
Avadavats ( Sporaeginthus amandava), Indian Silver-bills ( Uroloncha
malabarica), Cut-throats ( Amadina f. fasciata), and Java Sparrows
(Munia oryzivora) had eggs and later reared a few young. A pair of
Red-crested Cardinals (Paroaria cucullata ) on 3rd May had a nest of
four eggs in a shrub. This nest was eventually destroyed. A second nest
was built in a box, but no eggs were laid. A pair of Red-headed
Cardinals (. Paroaria larvata) built on a suspended platform of twigs.
Four eggs were laid by 28th June, but were not hatched.
An unpaired Desert Eagle-Owl ( Bubo ascalaphus desertorum) laid
an egg on 22nd February and sat upon it unceasingly. It was removed
on 15th March and two half-incubated eggs of the Egyptian Kite
substituted. One of these she hatched twenty-six days later but appeared
quite incapable of feeding her foster-child and it died within a week.
The same bird laid an egg on 25th March of the year following.
No breeding successes were achieved with any of the Cockatoos or
the larger members of the Psittaci, but nineteen young in 1925 and fifteen
in 1926 were reared in an aviary containing some thirty adult Black-
cheeked Lovebirds (Agapornis nigrigenis), while Budgerigars, both
green and yellow varieties, bred freely.
The hen of a pair of Egyptian Coucals (Centropies senegalensis
aegyptius) commenced to lay on 15th May and, between that date and
1st June, produced eight eggs. The first three were dropped on the ground
and broken, but the subsequent ones were laid in a basket fastened to the
branches of a small sont tree growing in the aviary. This receptacle
the birds built about with twigs and lined with coarse grass. Both

sexes sat intermittently but, although pairing was seen to take place
on several occasions, the eggs proved to be unfertile. In a state of
nature this species builds a domed nest resembling that of the magpie.
The eggs are a pure glossless white and measure 35 by 25 mm. These
birds are most attractive both in appearance and in respect of their
rippling series of " cuk " like notes uttered in a descending scale.
The sexes are alike in plumage. They are dangerous to other birds,,
and should be given an avairy to themselves.
Of the doves, young were reared by the Red-eyed Turtle Dove
(Streptopelia semitorquata) , Dongola Dove (Streptopelia decipiens),
Equatorial Palm-Dove ( Stigmatopelia s. senegalensis), Egyptian Palm-
Dove (S. s. aegyptiaca), and Cape Dove ( Oena capensis).
A Senegal Sandgrouse (Pterocles senegalensis) laid one egg on
18th April, and a clutch of two on 24th and 26th May of the same
year. No attempt was made to cover the eggs, i.e. to incubate them.
They proved to be unfertile.
A pair of Saharan Stone-Curlews ( Burhinus oedicnemus saharae )
hatched young on 16th May and 24th June. Incubation period,.
22-23 days.
A pair of King Reed Hens or Purple Coots ( Porphyrio madascariensis)
reared broods of two and four young in 1926 and 1927, respectively.
The earliest laying was 10th January, and the latest mid-July. Tho
nest was built on a platform of sticks raised about a foot above the-
floor of the aviary. The eggs, similar in colouration to those of the-
Moorhen, have an average measurement of 54 by 36 mm. They were
laid on alternate days and the greatest number in a clutch was five.
Incubation lasted from 23 to 25 days, and both sexes shared in it.
Peafowl ( Pavo cristatus) hatched three young on 28th August and
other eggs were brought off under a foster-mother and in an incubator.
Incubation period 25-27 days. An unmated Abyssinian Crested
Erancolin (Francolinus sephaena spilogaster) laid eggs on 28th and
29th April.
A Griffon Vulture (Gyps f. fulvus) produced an egg on 8th March,
1926, and, probably the same bird, on 28th Eebruary, 1927. She
sat well on both occasions, but the eggs were unfertile. The measure-
ment of one was 81 X 65 mm. A Northern Lappet-faced Vulture;

(Torgos tracheliotus) laid on 15th February, she sat steadily for a few
days and then broke the egg. Another was laid by this bird on 28th
March of the same year, but was also broken. One egg measured
90 X 66 mm. A Black Vulture {Mgypius monachus) laid on 28th March.
She smashed the egg within a few hours. It measured 90 X 63 mm.
It should be mentioned that all these particular vultures were caged
with others of their own and different species. The two first-named
forms seemed to be paired.
The climate of Egypt would not appear to be suitable for the
breeding of many of the Anseres (Swans, Ducks and Geese). Two Mute
Swans had nests of five and four eggs respectively in April, 1926,
and seven and six in March, 1927, but no young were hatched. The
eggs were usually laid on alternate days, but sometimes at longer
intervals. A paired Summer Teal (JEx sponsa) laid five eggs at the latter
end of May, but did not sit, and the eggs proved to be unfertile. In the
Goose paddock a pair of Canada Geese ( Branta canadensis ) had a nest
of five eggs in 1926, but failed to hatch them. In 1927 a nest in which
the goose had laid three eggs by 2nd February was pirated by a semi-
domestic bird. The Canadians were moved to another paddock, where
seven eggs were produced towards the end of March. Two young were
hatched and reared from this nest, while the semi-domestic Goose
aforementioned hatched another two with some of her own. Buppell's
Spur-winged Geese ( Plectropterus gambensis) reared four young in
1926, but nests of eleven and nine eggs in 1927 were all unfertile. An
unpinioned Egyptian Goose ( Alopochen cegyptiacus) mated to a pinioned
gander hatched broods each year, but most of these young were destroyed
by vermin. Buddy Sheldrakes ( Casarca ferruginea) reared two out of
a hatch of three young. The nest was built in a hole on ground level
in one of the artificial grottos in which the Gardens abound.
Three pairs of White Storks ( Ciconia alba) in a paddock containing
about a dozen birds of this species, had nests, built on the ground,
early in May, 1926, and in mid-April, 1927. The nests held from three
to five eggs. In 1926 one pair hatched five young, but these gradually
disappeared within a few days and were undoubtedly eaten by the
parents or the other Storks. Incubation period 25-27 days. In 1927
no young were hatched.

A pair of Marabou Storks (Leptoptilus crumeniferus) had a scrappy
nest on the ground of their paddock. No eggs were laid, but the female
bird sat on the nest for weeks on end.
A note that has no relation to any attempt at breeding may never-
theless be worth transcribing. Our rara avis--the Shoebill (Balamiceps
rex) --of which three specimens were exhibited and had been inmates
of the same paddock for a number of years past, never in my time
showed the slightest interest, either sexual or combative, in one another.
Their enclosure was a large one and each kept exclusively to a particular
portion of it. What their sexes are will not, I expect, be ascertained
until they leave the menagerie for the museum.
Of several adult pairs of North African Ostriches ( Struthio c.
camelus), only two nested in 1926. One pair hatched six young out of
twenty eggs between April 21st-22nd. The other pair, ten out of
twelve eggs between 10th and 12th May. Directly the young of this
latter pair came out of their shells the female parent started to ill-
treat them--picking them up in her beak, shaking them and dashing
them to the ground. They were rescued as soon as possible, but two died
from the effects of their injuries. The remainder were successfully
reared by hand and, in their younger days, were most engaging in their
tameness and habits. In 1927 three pairs went to nest. The first had a
total of twenty-one eggs, from which nine young were hatched between
29th and 30th April. The hen of the second pair produced in all sixteen
eggs, none of which hatched owing, I think, to the irregularity with
which they were covered. The third, which did not have their first egg
until the unusually late date of 4th April, had a total of twelve, and
hatched eight of them between 4th and 6th June. It was the hen
of this last-mentioned pair who had assaulted her young the previous
year. She again likewise misbehaved herself and the young had to be
immediately removed--this time without serious damage.
The incubation period of our Ostriches varied from 36 to 40 days
from the laying of the last egg. Both sexes took a share in incubating ;
the cock generally sitting after dusk (probably an inherited habit as,
in the desert, the male bird on the nest would be decidedly more
conspicuous than his mate), the hen during daylight hours. There were,
however, exceptions to this practice, the male being occasionally seen

a day or two before the clutch was completed. During the period to
which these notes refer, the earliest date of laying was 6th February
in 1926, 19th January in 1927. Eggs, almost without exception, were
laid on alternate days, with one pair generally between 4 and 4.30

one hen was seen to scatter sand or light soil over her eggs, using her
beak for the purpose, and this same bird--her mate was not noted to

In the spring of 1928, Chapman's with a large consignment of other
birds, brought over five Tinamous, which I secured*. On looking them
over on their arrival I found that there was a good deal of difference
amongst them, some having yellow and others flesh-coloured legs,
whilst some were much richer buff on the breast and abdomen than
the others. I was uncertain whether these differences were due to
sex or age, or whether there were two different species, and am still
uncertain as to this. A few days after arrival one of the birds was
killed by a Francolin, and the body was sent to the British Museum.
This bird had bright yellow legs and rich buff underparts. The British
Museum authorities reported that they were unable to identify it.
Later in the year two more died, and one of the bodies, this time a
bird with flesh-coloured legs and pale underparts, was sent to the
British Museum, who identified it as N. perdicaria. The birds nested
several times last year, but owing to an invasion of rats and the dis-
turbance in the aviarv in dealing with them, were unable to incubate,
so nothing happened. This season I removed them to another aviary
and as I never heard the male calling I concluded that they must be

two females. However, early in July my man brought me the body of a
Tinamou chick about a week old, that he had picked up under the table
on which the Finches, etc., are fed. A careful search disclosed the nest
containing B one addled egg and shells of about five more. There was
very heavy cover in the aviary and for a couple of weeks I saw no signs
of the young birds, and then I spotted a single one, about the size of a
Quail. It was quite alone, and apparently entirely independent of its
parents. Since then I have occasionally got a glimpse of others and
think that there are three altogether, although this is difficult to say,
as I have never seen more than one at a time. At the time of writing
they are about the size of Partridges, which they very much resemble
when crouching upon the ground. N. perdicaria is very much the
same size as N. cinerascens, but is not quite so long on the leg, and is
a bit plumper in the body. Its upper parts are much richer in colour,
and the breast and abdomen more rufous. The feathers on the head
are not erectile, a very marked feature with N. cinerascens. The eggs
cannot be distinguished from those of that species. I am not certain
whether it had been bred in captivity before.

An aviary experience which happened to us this year and the
inference which we drew from it may, if the latter is correct, be of
interest and a warning to others.
It concerned a pair of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks ( Hedymeles
ludovicianus) which had been wintered out of doors and were
apparently anxious to go to nest; they had been seen pairing but no
nest had been built. In order to help them, one afternoon we placed,
in a bundle of twiggy branches which were already in the flight, a Black-
birds' nest which had been deserted for 3 or 4 weeks although containing
three eggs, which we removed.
The next morning the hen Grosbeak had laid in this nest, which
she continued to do till she had laid three eggs, the parents sat well,

and in due course hatched two young. These they tended with
exemplary care, but even so, though they grew rapidly and began
to feather well for six days, first one and then the other ceased to
progress, became very anaemic and died on the 8th and 9th days
respectively.
On examining the dead young we found them to be infested each
with some half dozen ticks of various sizes, up to S the size of a large
blow fly larva only relatively stouter. We immediately caught up the
parent birds and searched them, but they were free ; they almost
immediately dropped into moult and now look particularly sleek
and well.
We concluded that the Blackbird's nest was probably the source
of the infection and that this was the probable reason of the parent
Blackbirds'desertion of their nest and eggs, though of course it may have
been due to another cause such as death of one of the Blackbirds. But
the nest was, in the first place, well concealed and there is but little
bird-killing vermin around here.
One amusing episode concerning this happening was that the original
Blackbird's eggs were rather small ones, and as already mentioned,
when the nest was put up in the aviary the eggs were removed ; when
I looked in the nest the next morning one's surprise (seeing that I had
never seen the Grosbeak's egg before) may be imagined when I
apparently saw one of the rather small Blackbird's eggs back in the
nest; it was only after referring to several avicultural and other books
that one found that the Royal Natural History, vol. 3, describes the
Grosbeak's eggs as being " a light and rather pale green in colour,
profusely speckled with dull reddish brown " that one realized that one
was looking at the Grosbeak's egg and that one of the almost exactly
similar Blackbird's eggs had not been replaced by way of a practical
joke !
We shall not use nests already made by wild birds for this purpose
again without baking them first. We have been fortunate in breeding
Many-coloured Parrakeets (Psephotus varius) this year. Our two pairs
both went to nest and each laid four fertile eggs ; one pair, which went
to nest a month before the other, experienced some rather sharp weather,
and only hatched and reared one young one, the other pair hatched

and reared three young : net result, three cock and one hen young
reared, and all beautifully fit and active.
A hen Blue-banded Parrakeet (Neophema venusta) most
unfortunately fell sick and died after the pair had selected a nest, and
a pair of Barnard's Parrakeets (Barnardius barnardi) were unfortunately
so badly disturbed when on the point of nesting that they gave up and
fell into moult.
Although we have for several years had fertile Many-colour eggs,
this is the first time we have succeeded in hatching and rearing them,
and we attribute the success to the prolonged cold spell in the early
part of the year, which delayed any nesting operations for four or five
weeks beyond their usual time, the first pair going to nest about
20th April. We shall therefore withhold their nests till about this
date another time, as a few cold days seems so disastrous to the lives
of the embryo chicks. The nest-boxes were placed in the open flight.

Sir, --In my letter of July re Carolina and Mandarin, I did not intend
that it should imply that Mandarin would not naturalize nor naturalize
better and easier than Carolina ; far from that, for I think they would,
and no Duck could look more beautiful in the parks of London than the
Mandarin.
I wished only to emphasize that our stock of Mandarins are obviously
hardier from the continual infusion of " wild " blood from imported
drakes, whereas the Carolina, not being imported, our stock in Europe
generally must be considerably inbred and therefore cannot have had
the same chance of proving their worth as the Mandarin have had. We
find here that the Carolina lay far more eggs than the Mandarin, but the
fertility is poor.

Sir, --What appears to me somewhat extraordinary has occurred
in one of my aviaries in which were forty-six small birds. On 6th ult.
I lost one Longtailed and one Heck's Grassfinch, on 7th, 9th and 12th,
another Heck's each day, total five in seven days. Post mortem by
Mr. Hicks of two of them revealed catarrhal enteritis and undigested
seed and grit had passed into the intestines ; there were nine of these
birds in this aviary, of which three were last year's birds and three this,
and I am of opinion that only one of this year's birds died. What seems
so extraordinary to me is that no other bird had died in this aviary
since March except a hen Cordon Bleu on 2nd ult. Can any of our
readers suggest an explanation why this one species should have thus
suffered ? The four remaining appear well at present, but the others
showed no signs of sickness beforehand, but were found dead or dying.
Nothing good worth recording has taken place. Beech's Jays
nested, laid one unfertile egg on which the hen sat assiduously, and then
the cock died ! Blue Budgerigars, Zebra Finches, White Javas,
Bengalese, Longtailed Grassfinches and Diamond Doves have all nested
and been more or less successful so far. White-Capped Starlings have
showed signs of nesting, Yellow-wattled Lapwings were seen to mate
on several occasions, but no nest. Black-bellied Sandgrouse have made
no attempt nor yet Virginian Cardinals or Fischer's Lovebirds ; all these
are pretty certain pairs and well established and healthy and greater
things might have been expected of them !

went off one by one, the other eight being now quite half grown. One
might suppose that these birds could be easily established at large and
make good sporting birds, being strong fliers. Moreover, as they go to
perch they should be fairly safe from foxes and other vermin. I have
never heard of this being done, and should be very interested to hear
from any of our members who have attempted it, with a view to doing
so myself next year.

Sir, --Having the misfortune to lose both the cock and hen of a
pair of Barrabands who had a nest I gave the eggs to my Sula Island
King Parrakeet who was incubating two of her own. With the assistance
of her Crimson-winged husband she has hatched and reared two
Barrabands and one hybrid. The Crimson-wing, like most of his kind,
is an indifferent husband but a good father, remaining gentle and
forbearing with his children long after they are able to feed themselves.
This year, however, I have had to take him away, as, while remaining
as amiable as usual to his own hybrid child he became spiteful with the
young Barrabands soon after they had flown. He knew the difference
perfectly well, and was not to be imposed on, showing that a Parrakeet's
intelligence in such matters is higher than that of the corvine birds
which are victimized by certain foreign Cuckoos.
A three-year-old elder brother of the hybrid just mentioned is
now moulting into adult plumage and is showing a quantity of light
yellow-green feathers on each wing. It is curious that by crossing a
Parrakeet with a red wing-bar with one with no wing-bar at all you should
produce offspring with a pale yellow-green wing-bar rather like that
of the other species of Kings. The wing of a Sula Island of either sex
is uniform dark green.

Sir, --Shortly after the accident to my hen Stanley Parrakeet
reported in the July number, this bird laid another clutch of four eggs,
but they were laid so irregularly over a period of 16 days that I scarcely
expected any results from them.
One of them hatched, however, on 3rd August, but the chick died
on the following day. The hen was evidently unable to feed it for its
crop was quite empty. Her upper mandible has not grown again, and
she will, I am afraid, be useless for further breeding. In fact, I do not
expect her to survive more than a few days now, for it is unlikely that
the cock will continue to feed her.
I removed the remaining three eggs on 11th August and all were
fertile and in various stages of incubation as I expected.
I am very surprised the beak has not been reproduced as I after-
wards found several young Budgerigars with broken beaks, evidently
from the same cause, and in each case the injury is gradually
growing out.

MOVABLE AVIARIES

Sir, --I detect in portions of Captain Stokes' article a kindly tilt
at some of my methods of aviculture which impels me to reply, I hope,
in the same spirit (and not in that of the three Robins who at the
moment of writing are settling a territorial dispute in front of my
window) !
As Captain Stokes admits, it is not easy to house Parrot-like birds
artistically on account of their destructive propensities towards growing
shrubs. My movable aviaries are, I admit, very inartistic because I
like to keep and study and breed the maximum number of attractive
species under the most hygienic conditions. But if anyone prefers a
few birds artistically housed to a larger number in aviaries without
" frills ", there is little reason why provided it has a good solid base
for moving, a movable aviary should not be as nicely-proportioned
as a fixed one and as pretty from an architectural standpoint. Certainly
I think that my movable aviaries with fresh green grass and wild
flowers covering the entire floor of the flight are quite as pleasant to
the eye as any of the fixed Parrakeet aviaries of my friends that I have
seen, with their bare patches of earth, rank tufts of sparse grass, and
half-chewed branches. With regard to the use of movable aviaries
for Tanagers and Sunbirds, there is no reason why in summer a movable
aviary for these birds should not be a very pretty spectacle indeed.
Before the aviary is moved on to its summer site the turf can be partially
removed and when the aviary is in position some loam can be thrown
down on top of the wire, and a variety of those annual climbing and
flowering plants put in which are able to resist the bad effects of
" drip ". Shrubs in tubs and pots, artistically concealed with earth,
foliage, movable rockwork, etc., can also be added.

If you can keep your birds in perfect condition for the maximum
number of years in fixed, naturally-planted aviaries by all means do
so, even though you may have to make some sacrifice in breeding,
but I am most strongly of opinion that a perfect bird of any species in
a movable aviary is a pleasanter spectacle than an imperfect one in
the loveliest setting that art can devise--if you have to choose between
the two. I am also convinced that the person who simply to gratify
his eye for a brief period, shortens the lives of his stock and increases
their liability to disease and injury by spiteful companions is no true
bird lover, though he may in a certain sense be a true artist.
Lest it might be thought that all the attractions of a setting of
tree and flower are divorced from aviculture at Warblington I would
add that movable aviaries, in addition to being best for systematic
breeding, also make the best base for liberty aviculture which shows
off the beauty of your foreign birds to better advantage than even the
most tasteful of aviaries. Waxbills and other little Finches may look
nice in a naturally-planted aviary, but they look even nicer free among
your verandah roses, or hopping on your garden path, or sitting among
the sweet peas. A cock Weaver may be a bright bit of colour any-
where, but you need to see him flit like a ball of fire across a pond
and settle on the branches that overhang the opposite bank to enjoy
him at his best.
A cock Broadtailed Parrakeet rising from lawn or meadow and
moving with graceful dipping flight and into a near-by tree looks
lovelier than he ever can in confinement. A King or Crimson-wing is
shorn of half his beauty when he does not show his colours in the air
against a background of sky or foliage. A young Barraband or Rock-
peplar in an aviary is just an ordinary greenish Parrakeet with a long
tail no more interesting than a hen Ringneck ; at liberty it is a poem of
speed and grace that makes one hold one's breath with wonder. The
question might be asked, " What has all this got to do with movable
aviaries ? Could you not have birds at liberty just as well if the
aviaries were fixed and tastefully planted ? " The answer is " No ! "
Most of the Finches that beautify your garden in the summer have
to be wholly or partially confined in the cold weather, and if the
soil of the aviaries is sour, the number of healthy birds left for release

on *the return of spring is likely to be small. With Parrakeets the
advantages of movable aviaries are even greater. The average person
who has not a big estate on which he can risk turning out birds in
couples, must rely for his display on the cocks of breeding pairs, and
on young birds of the year. On stale ground your cocks will not
live very long, nor be available for release for many successive winters,
while the output of young from Polyteline Parrakeets and their near
allies--the best kind of young birds for a liberty display--is likely
to be small owing to a high percentage of infertile eggs. Movable
aviaries also lend themselves to convenient arranging so that liberty
birds do not interfere with each other. If you have a range of fixed
aviaries with a pair of Rosellas, a pair of Pennants, and a breeding-
pair of Barrabands in adjoining compartments you may find things
in a nice mess once you start letting birds out. The cock Rosella and
the cock Pennant may engage in a furious and fatal conflict, urged on
by the proximity of their wives and homes. If you shut one up and
let out the cock Barraband, the latter will be chivvied away every time
he comes down to see his wife or tries to enter the feeding and roosting
aviary you must provide to protect him from owls. If his children
are let out they too will be persecuted by the ill-natured Broadtail who
may make matters worse by himself entering the roosting aviary
attracted by the food left in view of the young birds when they are
being taught to come home at night. But move the aviaries some
fifty yards apart, and then there w T ill be little bother and no serious
fighting and all can be out together.

Sir, -- I have been successful in breeding the Silverbill at liberty
for the first time. In May, I released eight of these birds in the garden
and when I returned in August, a certain number were still to be seen--
at least one pair and an odd bird which consorted with the Bib Finches.
From the fact that the pair or pairs were always together it w r as evident
that either they were not breeding or had young nearly full fledged,
and in no need of brooding. The latter proved to be the case, for one

afternoon four strong youngsters followed their parents to the feeding
tray.
Having little experience with the species and its allies, I was under
the impression that the sexes of the Silverbill are almost indistinguish-
able. I was therefore rather surprised to find that with my birds at
any rate the cock is not only paler than the hen, but also very much
larger. I do not find that the St. Helena Waxbill is at all the amiable
bird that some writers declare. For a Waxbill it seems to be decidedly
spiteful and only a little less ill-tempered than the Violet-ear.

Sir, --Why is it, I wonder, that all the packet Parrot foods on the
market appear to be unsuited to form the staple diet of any Parrot-
like bird except a Black Cockatoo, which not one person in ten thousand
is likely to keep ? I have examined Parrot mixtures made by three
of the leading firms dealing in bird foods and find them all much alike
in that they consist almost entirely of sunflower, safflower, and hemp
with a proportion of useless extras such as dry maize, wheat, dari,
and pumpkin seeds, which no normal Parrot ever touches. Plain,
wholesome seed like canary is conspicuous by its entire absence. Of
course, quite a number of commonly imported Parrots, Parrakeets,
and Cockatoos have constitutions strong enough to resist the effects of
unlimited hemp and sunflower, but a considerable percentage sooner
or later fall victims to liver trouble and feather-plucking, the popular
African Grey being more easily affected than the Amazons. Why
cannot the seed merchants sell as " Parrot Food " a mixture which
suits all individuals of the commonly imported species--Greys,
Amazons, Ringnecks, Roseate, and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, and.
the larger Australian Broadtails ? On a mixture of one part canary,,
one part white millet, one part oats, one part sunflower, half part
hemp, and one part peanuts, I have got practically all the above-
mentioned species into show and breeding condition and I have
never had a case of digestive trouble, malnutrition, or feather-plucking.

continuance of the sale of unsuitable " Parrot Poods ", as a letter I
wrote to a paper dealing with bird-keeping was not published.
One firm told me that customers complained that they were not
getting value for their money if a proportion of small seeds was included
in their Parrot mixture. Such fools who assess the value of a bird
food by the size of the ingredients should go the whole hog and feed
their Parrots on coconuts and their finches on broad beans, and it is
a pity if they are really sufficiently numerous to hinder a reform so
simple and so badly needed.

VIRGINIAN EAGLE OWLS BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY

Sir, --I have just been reading in Borrer's Birds of Sussex the
Owls which were kept by a former Duke of Norfolk in the keep of
Arundel Castle were Virginian Eagle Owls, a present from North
America, and he says that they only lay usually one egg in a season,
but in 1859 one bird laid three eggs which produced three fine young,
which grew to maturity.
If the identification is correct this species has been bred in England
as long ago as 1859, and that is not necessarily the first time they bred
at Arundel.

THE STORY OF A PIGEON
Sir,-- Since writing the story of a Pigeon in the June Magazine,
I should like to add a further note. For after I had written that a Cairn
puppy has become a member of the household, and though he is very
good with my Parrots, even sitting on the same chair, and allowing
one of them to comb him all over, he will not tolerate the sight of a
Pigeon. He seems to think they must be on a par with cats, rats, and
the like, to be chased from the house at all cost. Consequently, instead
of being able to have the tray inside my room for the Pigeon to feed
on, it now has to be on the window-sill. This evidently attracted the
attention of a pair of Wood Pigeons, who now come all day long to

feed. They are certainly very handsome birds, and make the domestic
variety look very small and commonplace. I quite agree with Lord
Grey in his book The Charm of Birds, where he says the Wood Pigeon
has " a look of perpetual astonishment This, I think, is accounted
for by the black pupil not being set quite in the middle of the yellow
iris, but a little to one side, which gives this odd effect. I find these
birds very much tamer than the common Pigeon for they will allow
me to stand right up to them, within three or four inches. Another
thing that has struck me is the silence of their wings. They seem to
glide off the window-sill without a sound, whereas the Common Pigeon
makes quite a fluster when he flies away. To-day (18th July), as I
WTite, a third Wood Pigeon has arrived, a cock bird, and he promptly
had a scrap with the first cock. I fear this is hardly avicultural, but
the taming of wild birds has a fascination and charm all its own.

Sir, --Miss Knobel's recent interesting note on her Pigeon friend
reminds me to put on record the following remarkable episode before
I forget it--I have already forgotten exact dates. Some time before
the Armistice--a matter of weeks so far as I can remember--a white
Homer appeared at the bottom of Tottenham Court Road, and haunted
this neighbourhood till the Armistice was declared, when it disappeared ;
in a day or two, if not on the very day. It was always alone, and used
to rest on a coping at first-floor level, above the fruit stall which was
there at the time and for years after. The fruit stall people fed it,
and I always meant to ask them about the exact dates, but put it off
till too late. This is the only white Homer I have ever seen, but a
peculiar silver-grey one with no markings appeared in the neighbour-
hood of Primrose Hill either during or shortly after the war, and stayed
there for some time. It evidently found a mate among the Street
Pigeons for a young Silver-grey Street Pigeon appeared after a time.
A heavily-wattled Dragoon turned out by Green's people at Covent
Garden before the war also found a Street Pigeon mate, but I saw no
cross-bred young. I saw a statement in a scientific journal some time

Aviculturcil Notes
back to the effect that the London Street Pigeons were rapidly reverting
to the Blue Rock. I have seen no evidence of this during a quarter
of a century's observation ; they have always been like Blue Rocks in
form, and the proportion of Blues has not increased to my knowledge.
It is a pity that when the birds were recently thinned out no attempt
apparently was made to eliminate the off-colours and make the stock
true Blue. Some such elimination has evidently taken place with
the park wfild Ducks, wdiich were a very mongrel lot in the nineties,
while now they are fairly true to type. Here there was probably some
Black East Indian and White Call-duck inter-mixture, but in the case
of the Street Pigeons I doubt if the variety of colour is due to crossing
so much as to spontaneous variation ; they are the old-fashioned
" dove-cot " Pigeons rather than the result of mixtures of breeds,
of which only the Homer appears to be able to succeed in the streets.

I last visited them two years ago. The lake, which was then being
formed, is now not only finished, but the vegetation on the islands and
surrounding ground has so grown up as to form a very beautiful
feature of the Gardens. There are many Waterfowl on the lake, and
Wild Ducks visit it frequently.
New buildings have sprung up in all directions, and the number
of aviaries is colossal, and the collection of birds in them extremely
fine. One meets rarities at every turn, and is struck by their splendid
condition. The collection is certainly a feast for the aviculturist, and
the ornithologist will meet with birds that are rarities even in museum
collections.
There have been some interesting breeding results this year at
Primley, foremost amongst these being the successful rearing of a
young Australian Thicknee or Stone-Curlew (Burhinus grallarius).

When I saw the young bird it was approaching the size of its parents,
and quite capable of looking after itself, although its parents were
still taking the greatest care of it. This is, I feel sure, the first time
this species has bred in this country, though it appears to have been
bred in captivity in Australia (Avicultural Magazine, 1925, p. 50).
Another success at Primley has been the hatching and rearing of
a young Port's Poller (Coracias caudatus lorti) and still another, the
breeding of the Sooty Rail (Limnopardalis rytirhynchus) but this
bred also at Primley last year. I hope we may soon have full
accounts of these successes from Mr. Whitley himself.
Several specimens of the Blue Crossoptilon ( Crossoptilon auritum)
from western China have recently been sent to Europe by Mr. Alex.
Hampe, who has generously presented one example to the Zoological
Society, the first to be exhibited in the collection.
There are also to be seen at the Zoo just now a pair of Purple-
throated Cotingas ( Cotinga cayana ) and examples of the Superb Manakin
(Chiroxiphia pareola), both species being exhibited for the first time
and forming part of a valuable collection of Brazilian birds presented
by Mr. J. Spedan Lewis.
It is sad to have to relate that Mr. Spedan Lewis is for the time
being disposing of his splendid collection of birds with the exception
of his pheasants. Lists of the specimens and conditions of sale have
been prepared, and will be sent to members of the Avicultural Society
on application being made to Miss Chawner, Thatched Holme, Wargrave,
Berks.
Lord Rothschild writes that his Sarus Cranes have successfully
hatched two young ones, now (13th September) about three weeks
old and doing well. The male bird ate the first two eggs laid, but sat,
alternately with the female, for four weeks and three days on the second
pair of eggs which hatched.

Now that the extravagant prices at one time asked for the colour
varieties of Budgerigars have been reduced to a reasonable level those
who are interested in these fascinating Parrakeets for their own sakes
rather than for the money that can be derived from them, are showing
a real desire to study scientifically the question of breeding them on
the lines which Mendel discovered as being the laws of heredity, and
by which can be calculated, within a comparatively small margin
of error, the results which may be expected from any given matings
of colour.
To thoroughly understand the question of colour breeding involves
an amount of very careful experimental work as well as the thorough
mastering of the theory, and those who, in this country, would wish to
succeed will be deeply grateful to those scientists, Dr. Duncker and
Konsul General Crewer of Bremen, who have not only mastered the
theory of the subject from A to Z, but have carried out exhaustive
experiments to test this.
The results of their experiments and conclusions have from time
to time been published in the Budgerigar Bulletin, but in,order to save
breeders the trouble of searching through numerous papers a booklet
has been produced by Dr. H. Duncker and published by the Budgerigar
Club at the very reasonable price of 2s. 8 d., which will be found to be
invaluable to those who would wish to take up the scientific breeding
of the rarer colour varieties. This booklet, which we strongly advise
any Budgerigar enthusiast to obtain, contains in addition to an
enormous amount of information, a set of eight well-executed coloured
figures of the various varieties of colours that can now be produced
in this one species.

[Concluded from page 246)
I paid a visit to a small shack belonging to the lady who so kindly
sponsored me during my stay on the island. It was situated in the
high mountains about 8 or 9 miles from Roseau on the leeward side
of the island. While there I met a cultured young man of colour and
during our conversation I mentioned about the " Ciceroo " and asked
him whether he knew anything about it. To my surprise he gave
me a rather interesting piece of information. He stated that just
after the terrible hurricane of the autumn of 1928 when great damage
was done in Dominica, a flock of these birds numbering from one to
two hundred, which he thought was the entire population of this
species, appeared in the valley where he lived, apparently seeking
food owing to all their own food being destroyed. The flock stayed
for a short time and then broke up into small parties and dispersed in
different directions, but not before ten had been shot and eaten.
I was able to get information upon which I could account for over
thirty-eight birds being killed and captured during the last three months
of 1928 and during the first two months of 1929. This includes twenty
birds killed by two men, including the ten mentioned above. Of course,
it must be accounted a very exceptional year, for the birds were driven
\0x25A0 out of their haunts by the hurricane, but thirty-eight birds out of a

total of less than two hundred is a very heavy toll, and if the killing
were to go on at this rate the birds would stand very little chance, as
they are slow breeders. The natives sav that they only lay one egg,
but they really don't know much on this point. I am sure that the
birds have no natural enemies except man. Only two escaped with
their lives, my own bird and another which is also in England but
I cannot trace where. 1 Several birds would have escaped the death
penalty had there been prospective buyers on the spot.
Realizing the futility of trying to find these birds and study them
in their haunts and get back in the day, I made arrangements to make
a several days' trek right up into the heart of the mountain forests,
and camp each night.
This trip will stand out in my mind as the most arduous piece of
trekking or mountain climbing I have ever done or hope to do again,,
but we stormed the well-nigh impregnable stronghold of A. imperialism
with what tragic results I will relate later on.
The way lay for the most part over much of the same ground,
covered by our previous excursion, but we pushed on over seemingly
impossible mountains, up and down deep ravines and gorges, across,
deep and fast-flowing rivers (Dominica is said to have 365 rivers, a fact
which no one seems to be able to prove or disprove). It rained for
the first few hours as it only can rain in the tropics, and we were-
consequently soaked before we had gone very far, but that did not.
deter us but it made the going very much worse, for my boots got
horribly caked up with the sticky mud and I could hardly lift my feet,,
but this disadvantage disappeared as we advanced into the forests.
At last, after hours and hours of struggling up and down the
mountains, I felt that I could go no further so I told my guide to camp
for the night ; but he shook his head and said that we were not yet.
in the home of the " Ciceroo " and that there were many decaying -
trees about which might fall down at any minute and as if to verify this - -
two decaying forest giants crashed to the ground very shortly after-
wards ; so on and on we went where I am sure very few white people-
have been before. At last, nearly dead with the heat, fatigue, and,
mosquito bites, we arrived in a gorge of unsurpassing beauty. Seldom

is it given to the eyes of civilized man to see a scene like that. On
either hand towered mighty cliffs covered with rank and luxuriant
growth, giant trees whose heads seemed almost in the clouds rose up
and vied with the slender palms and giant tree-ferns in the race towards
the light. Nearly every tree was festooned with huge orchids, vines,
mosses, ferns, and also a very curious parasitic palm. The air was hot
and heavy and very little light penetrated to the depths below. A
fast-flowing mountain stream rushed over huge boulders on its way
to the sea. The men soon got to work cutting down slender saplings
and graceful young palms. As I watched the lovely palms and delicate
tree-ferns fall to the axe, I had the guilty feelings of one who picnics
in a cathedral, but soon a fairly large and comfortable hut was built
which was made quite rain-proof, an absolute necessity owing to the
constant and heavy rainfall, and it was here in the silence of the great
tropical forest that I heard for the first time the marvellous notes of
the most mysterious and elusive of all birds, the " Siffleur montagne "
of the native, the " Solitair " of Gosse, or the Myadistes dominicanas
of naturalists, which only lives in the deepest recesses of the forests
of the high volcanic peaks of the Caribbean chain of islands. But
what gave me the great thrill was the sound from numerous throats
which I knew belonged to A. imperialis , and gazing up I saw these
wonderful birds flying round with the equally rare A. bouqueti feeding
upon the fruits of one of the huge forest trees or climbing about the
creepers which festooned the tops. I watched through my glasses
one old hen who climbed about with the agility of a monkey. I liked
the look of her because she looked such a sophisticated old bird, but
all at once I heard the report of a gun and saw her fall fluttering to
the ground. My men had brought guns to shoot wild pig and agouti,
and they had gone off apparently in search of such game, at least I
thought so, but in a few minutes they came back looking highly pleased
vfith themselves. " AVe got you a Ciceroo, sar, her no die, only wounded
in de wing," was what they greeted me with. I hoped this might be
so, and for a short time gazed entranced upon this glorious creature
which I had travelled so far to see and I ardently prayed that she might
live, but, alas ! in a short space of time I could see by her eyes that she
was mortally wounded. I picked her up and with a lump in my throat

saw the lovely shining purple head sink back and the beautiful orange
eyes close in death and heard the last few short gasps as she breathed
her last. I cannot tell how I felt, it seemed as though I had broken
some sacred trust, I had wandered into these Elysian fields and behaved
like a vandal, for I felt that the crime was upon my own head, and I
would have given anything to have seen her back in the tree tops.
My shame was increased when, later on, I saw the poor thing plucked
and dressed for the pot.
The flight feathers of this bird were very worn and frayed, in fact
I have never handled a wild bird whose feathers were in such poor
condition. Not a single wing or tail feather was perfect, every one
was broken and frayed. Evidently it was one of the birds which had
been driven out by the hurricane and had returned to find a worse
fate. When this bird was shot a pair of Bouquet's Parrots flew down
and screamed their rage at the hunters.
In spite of what the guide said about seeing dozens of these birds
we saw altogether whilst in the forest valley about eight Imperial
Parrots and four or five Bouquet's. Both species seemed to be feeding
and living in harmony. It seems strange that two such closely allied
birds should live in such close proximity. Soon after we arrived all
the birds dispersed and we only saw occasional ones fly over, and
although we spent a considerable time in the valley no more birds
came round to feed in the trees.
It is the same with this bird as with A. bouqueti , the hen is consider-
ably larger than the cock, in fact a large hen bouqueti is nearly as large
as a small male imperialis , but I don't think that the birds ever inter-
breed.
After my return from the valley of the " Ciceroo " the news got
about, much to my regret, that I would buy a " Ciceroo ", and several
native hunters travelled up into the valley and the surrounding districts
in search of the birds. This was unknowm to me, for I certainly should
have stopped them, for the men will shoot an endless number to get
one alive. To make matters worse, I received a letter from the
Administrator in which he stated that the news had reached him that
I had offered a large reward for live Imperial Parrots for export, and
owing to this numbers were being ruthlessly slaughtered and if this

were true the culprits would be severely dealt with by the law.
I suppose that this rumour had caused quite a stir in the legislative
chamber. All this was very distressing to me, and had I known that the
death of any of the birds would have been occasioned by my visit I
would certainly have not gone in search of them, but I was glad to think
that at least there was some feeling on the part of those in authority
concerning the fate of this bird. If, however, the bird is exterminated,
it will be by the black, and not by the white, man for, as the wild pig
and agouti get scarce, the native hunters will penetrate further into
the mountains and take a toll of the few remaining Parrots.
I found that several birds had been shot, including one by the
man who had been with me into the forests. He went out again on
his own very much against my wishes. The bird was wounded and
died, I should think, as much from rough usage as anything else,
for the natives treat the wounded birds with great brutality. Another
fellow was more fortunate and obtained a beautiful hen, but alas 1
the poor creature had one wing very badly broken, also one foot and
an eye severely hurt, in fact I thought the eye was totally destroyed..
I think it also had some internal injuries, but in spite of all this she
was a magnificent creature and looked like a small Harpy Eagle with
the purple ruff erected and wide open beak and the one eye flashing.
I put antiseptic dressings on the various wounds, but was unable
to do much owing to the great strength of the bird. I think she might
have turned into a lutino, for several of the wing feathers were yellow
tinged with a beautiful pink. The purple feathers on the head and
breast were interspersed with red ones, and there was a sheen on the
plumage such as I have seldom seen on any bird. She was in a very
different condition from the poor battered creature which was shot
in the forests. In fact, she was the finest Parrot I have ever seen.
One doesn't think of parrots walking majestically, but this one did.
The sight of this bird walking with ruff erect and fierce flashing eyes
would impress anyone. A Parrot usually waddles, but A. imperialis
walked with the dignity usually assigned to a queen.
We cut the wing feathers so that we could dress the wounds better,
but after a week of hunger striking and antiseptic applications she
didn't look the same bird though she never lost her dignity. It seemed

rather pathetic to see this wonderfully dignified creature of the great
mountain forests brought down to suffer untold indignities at the
hands of a creature whom no doubt she had never seen before and to
be robbed of her greatest heritage--flight. Many a time I wished her
back in her proper setting amid the indescribable grandeur of the great
mountain forests. I spoke to the hunter who brought this bird and
he said that years ago he had shot a good many of these birds, all
for food. Sometimes when a bird was slightly wounded he would
keep it for a pet, but when rations ran short, as they sometimes
did after a hurricane, the birds would be commandeered for
the pot!
My bird was as wild and as fierce as an eagle, it refused all food, so
we tried to feed it with a sponge soaked in milk, sugar, and brandy
and held on the end of a stick. This it would seize and chew up in its
anger, swallowing a little of the liquid in the meantime, but this made
its plumage in a terrible state ; we remedied it by putting the bird
out in the warm morning showers, which soon washed all the stickiness
off the feathers.
I had two tame Bouquet's Parrots, which took a great interest in
the Imperial, especially one which was the tamer of the two. They
seemed to recognize a friend and on the third morning I found one
on each side of her. The bird seemed to get a little better, but the
very distressing noise in the breathing continued. I feel sure that a
shot must have penetrated the lungs. I could have betted my last
dollar that the bird would die, and each morning expected to find a
lovely corpse. It still refused food, but on the fifth day it took a little
banana. It stopped screaming when approached and would let one
look at it with the ruff lowered. On the sixth day it ate some of the
large mild red peppers which I gave on the advice of a native woman,
who said that it would make the bird talk, but she also informed me
that should I ever give a Parrot butter it would never talk ! I have
never heard of an Imperial Parrot talking, but then there have been
so few in captivity. As soon as a stranger sees a Parrot, no matter
of what species, there is always the inevitable question, " Does it
talk ? " and then the usual " Pretty Polly ", etc. I always tell my
visitors that my birds never talk and never will. Then I am questioned

as to the use of keeping them. Why don't I sell them and get an
African Grey !
One day the hunters brought in a young hen Bouquet's Parrot.
Poor creature, she had one wing shattered and a terrible wheeze, which
showed that a shot had penetrated the chest. She looked so gentle
and pathetic and tried to hide her head all the time. I hadn't much
hopes of her living, but I put her into the outbuilding with the Imperial,
and upon seeing a friend the little houqueti went up and put its head
under the wing of the great imperialis. I expected to see the poor
creature's head bitten off then and there, but to my amazement the
wing was opened a little further to give more protection to the unhappy
bird. These two soon became friends, the houqueti pulled through,
and soon they were on the best of terms, living side by side ; when
in the garden they delighted in preening each other's feathers, in fact,
the houqueti lost nearly all its head feathers because of this.
It was not until the thirteenth day that the bird really ate anything :
before it just nibbled at things but hardly swallowed anything. I
thought it would die of hunger ; it got very light, in fact it seemed to
be only about a quarter of its former weight, but after a fortnight of
refusing food we put it out into the garden and it seized a banana
and ate it, and then a piece of sugar-cane. I had no idea that a bird
could live so long without nourishment. By this time the injured eye
had recovered, also the foot, but the wing still drooped a little. The
brilliant eyes had lost their fierceness, and the bird became altogether
tamer.
A week after the bird was brought by the native I was due to leave
the island, but knowing that if an attempt was made to take the bird
away and keep it on board ship it would undoubtedly die, I cancelled
my passage and stayed another three weeks. During this time the
bird greatly improved, but ate very little, in fact hardly enough to
keep a sparrow alive. It refused all food but sugar-cane, and that
has very little nourishment in it.
A large crate was made by a native joiner, who, despite all
instructions, made it exactly opposite to how it was intended to be
made, but we managed with it all right, and this was carried by native
carriers about twelve miles to the little port and from there to Roseau.

After staying there some days, where my bird caused quite a mild
interest, as most of the people had never seen a specimen before, I
sailed for Barbodos.
There are few places I regretted leaving so much as my wonderful
dream island. I have never met kinder people, white and native,
than those of Dominica, and have never seen or expect to see again
a place of such incomparable beauty. It was like leaving some dear
and cherished friend, for, like anyone else who has lived there, I had
come under the spell of the " Incredible Island ".
In Barbodos it was necessary to wait for a week before getting a
boat for South and Central America, so at the hotel the " Imperial "
and two pairs of the other Dominican Parrots which I had brought away
with me were lodged in a large fowl pen. This rest helped the
" Imperial " to regain some of its former splendour. The purple
breast-feathers appeared like spun glass in the sunlight. It was now
quite tame, though it never got as familiar as the other Parrots, but
it seemed almost a miracle that the bird recovered and looked so well
after the wreck it was a few weeks previously. Evidently A. imperialis
is blest with a good constitution.
In Costa Pica we managed to secure a quantity of sweet corn in
the cob, which is one of the finest foods for Parrots, and this the bird
commenced to eat with gusto and after this it started to eat ordinary
Parrot seed, which was a great relief to me.
On the homeward voyage we gradually managed to get together
a collection of rare Parrots, including Bodin's, Cayman Island, Yellow-
cheeked, etc. ; these were all placed in the crate with the Imperial
Parrot, and strange to say it proved to be the most amicable of all
the lot, letting the others do what they liked.
We met with very cold weather off the coast of Newfoundland, and
if it had not been for the kindness of the ship's stewards, who let me
have their mess room, which was specially heated, the birds would
all have died.
Judging from my bird and the ones which I have heard about in
captivity, the Imperial Parrot seems to have a disposition entirely
different from that of other Parrots. It has been termed morose,
sullen, and short-lived, but what else can one expect when a bird

like this is suddenly translated from its wonderful forest home, where
its food consists entirely of wild fruits, to a miserably inadequate
Parrot cage where it is confined for the rest of its existence in an equally
miserable climate and fed on dry Parrot seed ? I should think the
poor things die of a broken heart.
Given a certain amount of liberty in a garden or a large aviary
the bird appears to be active and friendly enough, though there is
always a certain amount of reserve about it. Towards the end of the
voyage my bird became extremely tame and affectionate, and would
let one do almost anything with it without attempting to bite, in fact
it proved to be one of the most docile pets I ever had.
In conclusion, I think I am correct in saying that the bird is safe
from extermination for some time to come. The greatest danger now
lies in the fact that the two edible mammals of the island, the wild
pig and the agouti, are, owing to persistent persecution getting very
scarce, and the natives are penetrating into the higher valleys of the
mountains in search of them and invading the home of the Imperial
Parrot. Tf they are unlucky, as they often are, in failing to obtain
either of these animals, they shoot the Parrots. Native hunters had
told me that they are not coming back empty-handed when there are
" Ciceroo " about. So to some extent the fate of the bird depends
on the fate of the two mammals ; the poor little agouti is nearly gone
but the wild pig will hold its own for a long time.
In St. Lucia, where the rare and beautiful A. versicolor is found,
the Government have instituted very severe penalties for anyone
found taking or killing a bird, and this has been very widely
circulated, with the consequence that the bird is rapidly increasing.
This should be done in Dominica, for in my opinion no penalty is
too severe for the wanton destruction of this magnificent bird.
Being so rare, very few of these birds ever come into the hands of
white people, and I think it very unlikely that many will leave the
island in the future, and it is also very difficult to get Government
permission to export them.

THE TRUE PIGEONS OR COLUMBINEE
By T. H. Newman
(Concluded from p. 213)
The sub-family Geopeliince contains a small group, closely allied to
the Turtle Doves, with rather long tails ; they spend much time on the
ground. The tarsus is scaled in front; as the typical genus has fourteen
tail-feathers and the other two genera only twelve these latter should
really not be included.
The Barred Ground Dove or Zebra Dove (Geopelia sinica).
I begin with this common species as it is the type of the genus ; striata,
by which this familiar little bird used to be known, is eight years later
than sinica. Robinson says it is abundant in open spaces throughout
the Malay Peninsula, numerous in gardens and on lawns, usually in
pairs, or sometimes four or five together, and feeds largely 'bn grass-
seed ; they nest early in the year in bamboo hedges and bushes. It
is a favourite cage-bird, both among the Malays and also in India,
and is one of the most freely imported species of the whole order. The
Zebra Dove nests readily in confinement, but is often very quarrel-
some. Forehead, cheeks, and throat ashy ; hind part of crown and
occiput reddish ; neck and breast barred with black and white : upper
surface brown with narrow black bands on edges of feathers ; middle
of breast pinkish-vinous, passing into buffy white on under tail-coverts ;
tail of fourteen feathers. The outer ones black, with broad white tips.
Young birds have the barring on the flanks continued across the breast
and abdomen, and there is no pink on the breast. Habitat: The south
of Tenasserin, through the Malay Peninsula to Java. ,
Maude's Dove (G. maugeus). A very rarely imported species,
first exhibited in the London Gardens in 1867, and a young one was
bred the following year. Nothing appears to have been written about
its habits ; it is recorded as extremely common round the town of
Sumbawa. Very like a young Zebra Dove, with the neck, breast, and
sides strongly barred with black and white ; abdomen and under tail-
coverts white with no vinous tinge ; the bare skin round the eye is
pale chrome yellow. Habitat: Lesser Sunda Islands, Timor Group. In

T. H. Newman--The True Pigeons or Columbines 277
September, 1914, two examples from Tenimber were purchased by the
Zoological Society of London. The bird from this locality is considered
separable from the typical form on account of the heavier barring on
the hind neck and nape and should be called G. m. audacis.
The Peaceful Dove ( G . placida). Before the war this was a very
freely imported species, and could be purchased very cheaply, but, like
most Australian birds, it is now difficult to get. It seems well named, as
it is of a quiet, peaceful nature, unlike its near ally, the Zebra Dove.
It is a common species, preferring moist meadows or grassy banks of
small streams ; it feeds on the seeds of grasses, and is found in flocks
of from twenty to fifty. Mr. H. L. White records two nests from Scone,
New South Wales, built in peach-trees, as being composed of bunches of
bright red berries of the pepper-tree. This is also very like the Zebra
Dove, but is slightly longer, and the barring on the under surface is
confined to the crop region ; the breast and sides delicate pale vinous.
Habitat: Australia generally, but not Tasmania. Tranquilla, which
used to be considered a distinct species, is only a larger and darker race
from the southern parts of Australia, while a paler form is found in the
mid-west.
The Bar-shouldered Dove (G. (Chrysauchcena) humeralis). This
is the largest member of the group, almost equalling in size the Common
Turtle Dove. An abundant species inhabiting thickets, swampy ground,
and the banks of running streams. In captivity it is very quarrelsome
with other Doves ; I had two pairs, but I do not remember rearing
any young. Its notes are loud, some of them reminding one of those of
the Cuckoo. Front part of head and neck also upper breast delicate
grey ; crown of head and nape brown barred, with black edges to the
feathers ; back of neck and mantle bright cinnamon, each feather edged
with black ; rest of upper parts brown, all the feathers edged with
black; lower breast pale lilac, fading to white on the under tail-coverts;
tail graduated, the outer feathers rufous chestnut tipped with white.
, Habitat: Australia generally except the south-west; three races from
Australia and one from Dutch New Guinea.
The Diamond Dove ( G . (Stictopeleia) cuneata) is the smallest member
of the family, and on account of its graceful shape and pleasing soft
colouration one of the most charming birds in the whole order. It is

common along the Fink River, sheltering during the heat of the day
under shrubs, but coming out to feed on the grass-seeds in the morning
and evening ; they nest usually low down in bushy shrubs near water.
A pair of these lovely little Doves kept among a mixed collection of
Seed-eaters will support themselves on the seed thrown out by the other
birds, though for breeding purposes it has been said that they do better
when several pairs are kept together, but they must have plenty of room
with abundance of cover, as they are very quarrelsome among them-
selves. M. Delacour has reminded me that people who breed them
extensively in France find that single pairs do best; they are often kept
there with Gouldians and other Finches. I have had several pairs,
which hatched many young ; they should have shelter from the cold
damp during winter. Head, neck, and breast delicate grey ; nape,
back, and scapulars pale brown, wing-coverts dark grey, with two
round white spots near the end of each feather ; central tail feathers
greyish, shading to black, the outer ones broadly tipped with white ;
abdomen and under tail-coverts white ; the bright red ring round the
eye adds much to its beauty. The female is browner and the white
spots not so pronounced. Habitat: Australia, but not Tasmania.
A northern and a southern race, the former being paler in
colouration.
The Scaly Dove ( Scardafella squammata). A very attractive little
Dove on account of its wonderful barred plumage ; it goes about in
pairs or small parties of about four, spending much time on the roads
and rising with a curious rattling noise to settle in the nearest tree when
disturbed. An interesting account by Mr. D. Seth-Smith of its nesting
will be found in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. II (New Series),
p. 278. I found the species inclined to melanism, as several birds I had
turned nearly black, perhaps from a too liberal supply of hemp-seed.
Above greyish-brown, all the feathers edged with black ; upper wing-
coverts paler, becoming white towards the tips and edged with black ;
below white, with pinkish tinge on lower neck ; the feathers, except the
chin, edged with black ; tail of twelve feathers, the three outer pairs
with broad white tips. Habitat: Brazil; other races from North-East
Brazil and Venezuela. The name squammata must be used for this
species instead of squamosa , which is preoccupied.

The Inca Dove ( S . inca). According to Bendire, this species is of a
tame habit, often frequenting the streets and gardens of towns. The
nest, placed in bushes or small trees, consists of a platform of
twigs and grasses. The Inca is very closely allied to the Scaly Dove,
from which it chiefly differs in having no white patch on the wings ;
abdomen and under tail-coverts are pale buff, not white, and the black
bars, especially on the breast, are much fainter. Habitat: South-
western border of United States to Nicaragua.
The next sub-family consists of the American Metal-spotted or
Bronze-winged Doves, formerly known as the Peristerince, but as the
genus Peristera can no longer be used in this connexion, as it has a
prior usage in Mulusca, they must now be known as the Columhince.
They are birds of small size, with metallic spots on the wings, which are
short; tail of twelve feathers. They are very terrestrial, spending most
of their time on the ground, and are very quarrelsome, fearlessly
attacking other Doves of much larger size.
The Picui or Steel-barred Dove (Columbina picui). After long
controversy this pretty little bird has been allowed to rest under this
genus. Hudson tells us it is common everywhere in the Plata, usually
seen in pairs, but sometimes as many as twenty may be met with in
one flock. It is resident and familiar, and comes a great deal about
houses. In captivity it nests freely, but the young are rather delicate.
I lost many before they were able to leave the nest; in spite of its
size it will drive away doves of far superior size ; a favourite way of
attack is to perch on its enemy's back. Crown and nape grey ; rest of
upper surface brownish-ash ; coverts and secondaries edged with white ;
a band of bright steel-blue across the lesser coverts ; sides of head and
neck with under-surface pale vinaceous ; chin and centre of abdomen
white. Female browner without the grey on head and vinaceous below.
Iris beautiful lilac. Habitat: S. Brazil, Argentine to Bolivia and Chile.
A paler and greyer form from North-East Brazil.
The Garnet-barred Dove (Eupelia cruziana). Mr. A. A. Lane
says : " This handsome little Dove is seen everywhere at Pica, in
gardens, streets, corrals, etc. I found a nest on top of a post supporting
the wall of a shed in the garden, it was a mere platform of stalks of
grass, and contained two newly hatched young. I believe that this

Dove nests more commonly in the forks of trees or shrubs." Four
specimens were presented to the London Zoological Gardens and others
deposited in September, 1915. I do not know of any others being-
imported. Head grey ; upper surface greyish-brown with vinous
tinge ; anterior greater coverts and inner secondaries with steel-blue
spots towards their tips ; a chestnut-purple band across the lesser
coverts ; under surface rosy-vinous ; bill yellow, with black tip.
Female duller and greyer, without the vinous on the lower parts.
Habitat: Ecuador to Peru, Bolivia, and North Chile.
The Passerine Dove (Chaemepelia passerina). Bailey, in his
Birds of Florida, writing of the typical form, says : " This, the smallest
of the Dove family, is found all over Florida, and is particularly
abundant in the coastal area. On driving along our roads, one sees
them sitting on the telegraph wires, real estate signs and house-tops,
or feeding in the roadway, where many are killed by the passing autos
as they speed along, especially when the birds are drinking from
depressions in the road during the rainy season." They feed on weed and
grass-seeds, and breed from January to November, placing their nests
anywhere from on the ground up to 15 feet or more in trees. Passerine
Doves have been imported in considerable quantities, and have nested
a number of times. Nearly everyone who has had several specimens
has remarked how they differ in colouration. This is hardly to be
wondered at, as there are at least sixteen different forms known, and
it is generally quite impossible to find out the locality where one's birds
come from. The typical bird has the crown, occiput, and hind neck
bluish-grey, the feathers margined with dusky ; upper parts plain
greyish-brown, wing-coverts lighter brown with metallic blackish-
purple spots ; primaries chestnut, with blackish ends and outer webs ;
forehead, sides of head, neck, and under-parts greyish vinaceous, feathers
of crop region with dusky margins giving a scaly effect. The female
lacks the vinaceous tint on the under-parts, and is generally duller.
Habitat: South Atlantic and more Eastern Gulf States of North
America, North to South Carolina. Other races from Texas, New
Mexico, Arizona, and California, South to West Indies, and through
Central America to South America, as far as Peru and Paraguay.
The bird known as terrestris is the same as the typical form.

T. H. Newman--The True Pigeons or Columbince 281&amp;apos;
The Pigmy or Grey Ground-Dove ( C . minuta). Nothing seems to
have been recorded about the habits of this little Dove in a wild state
except that they resemble other members of the genus. It was first
bred by Mr. Teschemaker in 1908, who gives an interesting account
under " Nesting of the Dwarf Ground Dove ( Chamcepelia griseola )
Avicultural Magazine, Yol. VI (New Series), p. 257, which caused
Mr. H. Bright to think he was the earliest to rear the species in 1924
(Avicultural Magazine, Vol. Ill (4), p. 253). Upper parts greyish-
brown ; upper wing-coverts greyish-vinous, the inner webs with some
steel-blue marks ; under-surface vinaceous ; under tail-coverts grey
with white edges. The female is greyish-brown above ; greater wing-
coverts edged with white, and under-parts pale greyish-brown. Both
sexes have under-surface of wing cinnamon or pale chestnut. Habitat:
Greater part of South America. A darker race inhabits South-West
Mexico to West-Central Colombia.
Buckley's Ground-Dove (C. buchleyi) is very like the Pigmy,
but the general plumage is more vinous and less grey. I have found
nothing about its wild habits ; it was represented at the London
Zoological Gardens in 1915, when I noticed the beautiful carmine eye
of the living bird, rather brighter in the male than in the female ; bill
dusky grey, paler at base ; feet flesh colour. The under wing-coverts
are black. Habitat: West Ecuador and North-West Peru.
The Talpacoti Dove (C. talpacoti). Schomburgh says that he met
with this pretty rufous species near the coast and in the Savannas,
though never in such large flocks as the Passerine Dove. Near the coast
it prefers open slopes devoid of woods. In Brazil it is found even in
towns and villages, and may be seen in the streets of Rio de Janeiro.
White says they nest in orange-groves in Argentina. This Dove has-
often bred in captivity ; I had a pair which certainly nested, though
I do not remember rearing any young. General colour vinaceous-
red ; upper part of head and nape grey ; paler below ; inner wing-
coverts, scapulars and tertials marked with black steel-blue spots.
Female duller and browner. Habitat: South America from Venezuela *
to North Argentina.
The Rufous-winged Ground Dove (C. rufipennis) is very common
in Central America, though it appears less frequent in Honduras .

282 T. H. Newman--The True Pigeons or Columbince
it has been bred by M. Jean Delacour in France. This Dove is very
similar to the Talpacoti, but has the quills cinnamon tipped with
brown ; under surface of wing cinnamon, but the innermost under
wing-coverts are black. The female is dull brown, paler beneath with
no vinous tinge. Range : British Guiana, Venezuela, and Colombia,
north to Guatemala, Yucatan, and Vera Cruz. In the lowlands of
South-West Mexico, North to Southern Sinaloa, a paler race has been
distinguished under the name C. r. eluta.
The Ashy Dove (Claravis pretiosa). --Mr. W. Goodfellow, writing
in The Ibis, 1902, p. 228, informs us that it is not common in Ecuador,
being met with in pairs running about the footpaths in the clearing.
When disturbed they skulk in the grass until a person is close to them,
then rise suddenly with a swift zigzag flight. In Central America,
according to Godman, it appears to be migratory and nowhere common.
The nest is placed on the outside boughs of low bushes. This does
not appear to be a frequently imported species, though it was brought
to Amsterdam as long ago as 1857 and to London in 1886. All three
species of this genus differ greatly in the sexes, the cocks being grey
and the hens brown. Male general colour bluish-grey, paler on under-
parts ; forehead and throat, nearly white ; greater coverts, outer
scapulars and inner secondaries with roundish blue-black spots;
primaries and end of tail, black. Female above brown, paler on forehead
and almost cinnamon on upper tail-coverts, the spots on the wings
brownish-cinnamon; below, paler brown. Habitat: South Mexico
to Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. This is the Dove which used to be
called Peristera cinerea.
Geoffroy's Dove {C. godefrida). --Taczanowski, Ornith. du Peru,
tells us he met with this Dove many times on the margins of the
temporary lakes in little companies or in pairs. It feeds upon fleshy
fruits as well as on seeds. It is much more freely imported than the
Ashy Dove. A large number have been bred in the London Zoological
Gardens since the year 1876. Male above bluish-grey, nearly white
on forehead and chin ; the wing-coverts crossed by three bands, a
smaller one on the lesser coverts blue. The other two, much broader,
are purplish-chestnut edged behind with pale grey ; tail, all the feathers,
except central pair, with white tips ; below grey fading to pure white

By H. C. Eustace
Owing to " pressure of work " during the past year I have been
unable to write for the Magazine, but am now sending along a few
notes which may perhaps be of interest to some of our readers.
During my studies of Chinese and in conversations whilst travelling
in the interior I have come across the following interesting bit of
folklore concerning birds :--
In the vicinity of Peking I asked a Pigeon fancier, whose flock
was circling high overhead, why whistles were attached to the
Pigeons' tails. His reply was that the whistling noise protected the
Pigeons from the attacks of Hawks. In further conversation he
informed me that Hawks never nested. Asked how they reproduced
themselves, the following explanation was given. Pigeons usually
lay two eggs to a clutch, but sometimes three are laid ; when these hatch
the young bird from the third egg is a Hawk, which when it grows
up eats the two young Pigeons and flies away to spend the rest of its
life hunting for more Pigeons to eat.
The Manchurian Crane does not lay eggs, but gives birth to young
ones ; furthermore, its life span is given as several hundreds of years.
Amongst other rare birds kept during the year was a young Chinese
Forktail (Henicurus sinensis Gould) which reached me in rather poor
condition from Hangchow, Chekiang.
On arrival it had to be hand-fed, but soon learnt to take small
insects when these were floating on the surface of the water vessel.
Its actions and general habits are similar to those of the Wagtails,
except that instead of raising and lowering the tail vertically, as do
the Wagtails, the Forktail opens and closes its tail, each fork

opening downwards and outwards. I have sent, under separate
cover, an engraved plate of this species from which members can
obtain a general idea of the bird.
I noticed that when bathing in a smooth-surfaced bath one
wing was lowered to steady the body whilst water was splashed on
the body by the head and other wing. I never saw it bathe in any
other way.
Although this specimen was quite tame it had little to recommend
it as an aviary bird. Unfortunately, it died suddenly from a mosquito
bite on the eye-lid, otherwise I should have given it liberty.
Derbyan Parrakeets.-- Several cocks and a single hen were
obtained from Szechuan last year, and were kept for varying periods
to recover from their 1,200 miles journey before being sent home to
England.
Owing to civil wars, banditry, and poor means of communication,
it is extremely difficult to obtain birds from the interior provinces.
Even when collectors are sent they often turn back on account of the
bandit dangers.
I am hoping that with the birds now in England some breeding
results will be recorded, but I am endeavouring to collect further
information regarding the habitat of this bird, and if successful will
write an article on it later.
Inge's Paradise Flycatcher (Terpsiphone incii, Gould).--A young
cock bird in immature plumage died two days after it came into my
possession. It is, in my opinion, an interesting and beautiful bird
which would repay further study. The variation in plumage between
the rufous immature cock and the adult black and white bird is most
striking.
Blue and White Flycatcher. --A few cocks appear in the market
each spring, usually in wretched condition due to poor accommodation
and wrong feeding from the time they are caught, but if purchased
before their vitality is too low they quickly recover and become tame
when suitably caged and fed. A specimen which I had for six months,
and which is now in England, appeared to thrive on a diet the basis
of which was Japanese fish meal, biscuit, sponge cake crumbs, or
yellow bean flour, with mealworms, flies, and other insects as obtainable.

Swinhoe's Crow Tit. --This is a most attractive bird in an aviary
or large cage where it can obtain sufficient exercise, and rapidly
becomes tame.
At the time of writing I have six in an outdoor aviary where they
have been wintered, and they appear to have remarkable vitality for
such small birds, judging from an unfortunate accident which happened
when the birds were first placed in the aviary. One night the birds,
frightened by cats, dashed against the wire and got caught between
a bunch of reeds and the wire netting, resulting in two birds losing
a leg each almost from the thigh. In spite of the cold winter weather
they pulled through and quickly learnt to balance and feed with only
one leg. I might mention that most food is held between the feet
whilst being eaten. Another interesting observation was the manner
in which these one-legged birds learned to rest, and that was hanging
head downward (like a bat) from a branch on the roofing wire. They
have very strong beaks and quite enjoy maize nuts, hemp, and sun-
flower seeds in addition to their staple food of mixed millet, fruit,
and soft food. Insects of all kinds are welcome, but I found the most
suitable were small white grubs which are to be found feeding in willow-
branches, as the work of splitting the willow twigs helps to keep the
birds' beaks in good shape.
Chinese Golden-wing (Chloris sinica). -- I have two pairs of these
birds. Both pairs nested in an indoor attic aviary : one nest of four
eggs hatched three young which died when four or five days' old, and
the other nest contained one clear egg. With outdoor aviary accom-
modation I am sure these same birds would have successfully reared
their young. Early in the spring one cock bird paired with a Green
Roller Canary hen, but the eggs were clear. The cross would not be
difficult to obtain if anyone wanted it.
A New Aspect of the Japanese Budgerigar Boom, 1927-8
In course of a brief conversation last week with a gentleman from
Kobe, who informed me that during the boom he handled half a million
yen (#50,000) worth of coloured Budgerigars at a considerable profit
to himself, I gathered that although the boom originated from an
endeavour to build up an export trade in home-bred birds, the gambling

286 W. Shore-Baily--Breeding the South African Water Bail
fraternity took up birds as a medium for speculation, and my informant
went on to say that regular exchanges were opened in almost every
street and people would buy a bird or birds at one room and sell at
the next place or the same street within a few minutes in the hope of
finding a higher bidder. On this account one can easily see why when
the bubble burst the rare coloured Budgerigars could not maintain
their market value of many thousand yen a pair !
Incidentally, I gathered that although this boom was the means of
several of the largest British dealers clearing enormous profits on their
shipments they were not content with legitimate business and tried to
put some very crude transactions through ; and may I add that in
my humble opinion the average British bird-dealer is hardly fit for
the kindergarten class when it comes to crooked business as done in
the Far East.
Now that the boom is over the coloured Budgerigar is being shipped
back to Europe, and the dealers are still clearing quite big margins
on their transactions. Large numbers of birds have gone to the
U.S.A. and even to Australia, where the Government has not yet seen
fit to put them on the prohibited list, which is strange when one reads
some of the names on this list. It's&amp;quot; surprising the hundred per cent

grown with, bullrashes and water-mint. In these weeds they were
completely lost, and I didn't see the Brown Kails again for two or
three months. The Black Kails, on the other hand, were to be seen
most days climbing about in the willows and bushes, and were not nearly
so shy as the others. In fact I consider them a delightful aviary bird.
The Brown Kails are the shyest, and consequently least interesting,
birds that I have ever kept. Our English Water Rails are just as bad,
and a single bird that was introduced into a neighbouring aviary in
the early spring has never been seen since, although I haven't the least
doubt but that it is still alive and well. I regret to say that I am
unable to write very much about the nesting of these birds, partly
because of their extreme shyness, and partly because of my absence
on holiday during the incubation period. The nest was very well
constructed of rushes, and was exactly like a miniature Moorhen's;
nest. The eggs were not to be distinguished from the eggs of our own
Rail. In the middle of July I went for a short holiday, and two days
after I had left I got a letter from my daughter saying that she had
caught a little Water Kail. From her description it was entirely
covered with black fluff and was about the size of the top of her thumb.
On my return in August I asked if anything more had been seen of the
young Kails or their parents, but no one appeared to have even had
a glimpse of them, and it was two weeks later before I got a momentary
view of one. As far as I could see it was about half the size of its
parents, and a dark, blackish brown all over. Just how many young
ones were hatched I do not know : but as no eggs were left in the nest
I conclude that they all left the nest, and that the others must either
have been killed by the Thrushes in the aviary with them or must
ave found some small hole that enabled them to get into a neigh-
bouring aviary where no doubt they quickly fell victims to the other
occupants. They would easily get through \ inch netting when newly
hatched. Yesterday, 10th September, I made an attempt to catch
the young Kail with a landing net, but unfortunately failed, as its
movements on the ground were like lightning. However, I saw it
near enough to be able to say that it was about the size of its mother,
but a good deal darker in colour. I might say here that the hen is
about one-third smaller than its mate, and I am wondering whether

this is so with the sexes in our own Water Rails. In colour and general
appearance the English and African birds seem exactly alike, and I
doubt if anyone could differentiate them without actually having
specimens in the hand. I have not knowingly heard the call of our
bird, although a few individuals are found here occasionally, but the
call of the African species is a low whistle uttered when excited or
alarmed. The call of the Black Rail is also a whistle, but clearer and
more musical. My Blacks are more musical. My Blacks are, I am
afraid, two males, as they have made no attempt at nesting. This is
unfortunate, as I am quite sure that they would be easy birds to breed
if a true pair could be obtained. Several years ago a hen I had then
nested twice, the situation being a tuft of grass, but I understand
that in Uganda they frequently nest in bushes some feet from the
ground. The eggs are much more finely speckled than those of the
Common and African Water Rails. I am enclosing photos of nests
and eggs.

By The Marquess of Tavistock
People who keep birds may be divided into two classes : those
who possess the avicultural sense and those who do not. The dividing
line may not be a very clear one, but the contrast of the two extremes
is great indeed. Persons endowed with the avicultural sense make
their bird-keeping a work of art. They give their birds the very
best that their means and. accommodation allow. They take pains to
discover, either from friends or from works of reference, all the needs
of the species that they keep and they are always striving to satisfy
them to the full. They have a quick eye for illness or poor condition,
and a sick or draggled bird is an offence to them and an evil to be
,speedily and completely rectified. They aim at perfection and can be
satisfied with nothing less.
People without the avicultural sense regard birds as an interesting
adjunct to their general menage. They are not wilfully cruel, but
they house them on the principle that " they ought to be able to live

there, don't you think ? " and feed them on the principle " that
ought to be enough for them They hardly ever read up about
the species they keep, and, if they ask advice, they seldom trouble
to take it if it involves any bother ; or, if they do try to take it, they
act in so unintelligent a way that they are soon discouraged by the
poverty of the results. They are slow to recognize illness and accept
ragged plumage and overgrown toe-nails as the inevitable outcome
of fate and avian perversity.
I will quote two examples of what I mean, but for very obvious
reasons no names will be mentioned !
Some time ago, in the centre of a large town, there lived an elderly
man who acquired a few foreign birds, although he had never previously
bred anything but canaries and that many years before. He was not
a nice man ; he was mean, grasping, jealous, and sly and was cordially
disliked and distrusted by most of his acquaintances. He was extremely
poor, having been long out of work and never likely to be again
employed. He inhabited a slum dwelling in bad repair and he and
his family were much overcrowded. But despite all this he had the
avicultural sense and his bird-keeping was a revelation to me of what
the most unlikely material can accomplish under the most dis-
advantageous circumstances. Inexperienced in foreign bird-keeping,
he had been wise enough to seek sound advice and follow it faithfully.
His roughly constructed but serviceable indoor aviary made the
maximum use of the limited accommodation available, with the result
that it was just enough to do the birds well. The aviary was spot-
lessly clean and no detail of management bearing on the provision
of sun and shade, draught-protection and nesting accommodation,
green food and grit, baths and natural perches, had been omitted.
Had he asked me what more he could have done for his birds I could
truthfully have answered, " Nothing."
Not many miles away there dwelt a member of the Avicultural
Society, respected and esteemed by numerous friends, comfortably
endowed with this world's goods, the owner of a nice country house
and garden--and also of a few foreign birds. This member had not
the avicultural sense. The birds, some of which looked rough and
dejected, were for the most part confined in a flight cage which was

too small. The cage was also filthily dirty. It was all-wire and fully
exposed to draughts ; there was no roosting accommodation, no
bath, no green food and no natural perches. When the owner asked
me what could be done for the birds 5 comfort I was tempted to reply,
44 Everything, 55 and was conscious of that rather overwhelmed and
helpless feeling which assails polite people (like me !) who think they
have the avicultural sense when they are suddenly confronted by
incompetence sheer, unutterable, and probably invincible. I made
one or two tentative suggestions but I doubt if they were taken or
bore much fruit, for, as I have already said, those who lack the avi-
cultural sense seem often as incapable of profiting by counsel as they
are slow to seek it. Yet surely nature and human art combined have
produced the bird even for such as they--the Barbary Dove--which,
ever since its ancestor returned with nesting material to the Ark, has
been unfailing in its willingness to live and breed under management
which would break the heart and constitution of any ordinary
feathered fowl.

By Hamish Nicol, F.R.C.S., F.Z.S.
Miss Knobel's 44 Story of a Pigeon 55 has prompted me to write
some experiences of mine with orphans I have attempted to rear
and maimed birds I have treated--my successes and failures.
The first maimed bird I ever had was a mongrel Plymouth Rock.
This was quite a young bird who had come to grief with a rat-trap.
Apparently she had tried to remove the bait and left the greater part
of her beak behind. The farmer, to whom the bird belonged, was
about to kill it, but I persuaded him to give it to me. I was very
young at the time and was delighted with my acquisition.
Feeding the bird was very difficult at first as it could not peck
and the stump of the beak was very tender. However, with patience
and feeding with soft food I kept her alive until the remains of her
beak got hardened and she was able to look after herself. I had
to put her food in a fairly deep cup so that she could pick it up.

After some weeks she became very independent, and returned to
London with us. She lived for many years in the garden, but used
to annoy my Mother by roosting on the drawing-room door. I forget
what the end of her was, but I expect she died a natural death.
My second bird was a young Duck. One very cold and wet day
I was walking round the Pond in Kensington Gardens when I noticed
a Duck with a lot of young ones apparently trying to drown one of them.
It would single this one out from the others and hold it under the
water. The poor little thing made its escape only to be caught again,
and another attempt at drowning would follow. The little Duck
became quite exhausted and was washed up on the bank. I picked
it up and when it had revived took it along to another Duck with
young and let it swim out to them. I thought it had got with the
wrong family and possibly that was what the trouble was. The
result was the same as before, so when it came near enough to the shore
I picked it up and put it in my pocket and brought it home. It was
very exhausted and cold. I did all I could to revive it, but I had had
no experience and I could not induce it to take any food and it died
that night.
My third experience was with an injured Pigeon. Some friends
of mine who live in the Temple asked me to go and see a Pigeon they
had captured. The history w r as as follows : they had noticed this
bird being mobbed by other Pigeons in the gardens. It was a full-
grown cock bird. It was very lame but could fly quite well. It was
having a very poor time and unable to get any food. In the evening
they captured this bird when roosting on the ledge under their windows.
When I saw the bird I found it had a wound over the right hip joint,
and that there was a fracture of the femur high up. I enlarged the
wound and removed a large lead bullet about the size of a pea. I also
removed some feathers that had been driven in and some loose pieces
of bone. It stood the little operation well. I dressed the wound
daily, packing it with a strip of iodoform gauze and allowing it to
heal from the bottom. The bird made a good recovery. He developed
a false joint and was able to get about on it well and without any
pain. My friends looked after the bird until he was quite recovered
and then let him go. He was now well able to look after himself,

and was constantly seen in the gardens mixing with the other birds.
He married and brought up a family. The last I heard of him was
that he was going strong.
The next case is perhaps more interesting. One morning when
my wife was attending to my birds a Pigeon flew against the window
with great force. It struck the window so hard that it was stunned
and fell into the front garden. It was picked up and brought into the
house quite unconscious. After some time it recovered, but when
it attempted to move it threw itself backwards. It was restrained
with difficulty. Any movement the same thing happened. These
back somersaults were very violent and the bird lay on its back kicking.
I came to the conclusion that it had injured one of the Ant. Lat. semi-
circular canals or possibly the inf. cerebellar paduncles.
It was very difficult to nurse this bird or to feed him. I met with
much opposition from my family. They said it was cruel to keep the
bird and urged me to give him some chloroform. I refused to give
him up and nursed him myself. This was a very difficult job single-
handed as directly he was touched he threw himself backwards and
feeding was difficult. I had to hold him and open his beak and force
food down. He had no idea of feeding himself. However, with a good
deal of patience I managed it. As the days went by the falling back-
wards tendency got less, and nursing got easier and after a time he
began to take his food, though he would still fall backwards if he were
startled or moved suddenly. Later he was able to walk a step or two.
Later he got better still and could walk fairly well though with a limp
and many falls. After about two months he could walk and feed
himself quite well. When he got quite strong I let him have a fly in my
room. As soon as he could fly well I took him into the garden and
let him go. He made straight for a tall tree near and was strong on
the wing. He used to come into my garden to feed for a long while
after this. We knew him by his slight limp. I think he is one of the
Pigeons that come to feed every morning still.
My next case was that of a Fan-tail Pigeon. One morning I heard
a fluttering scraping noise behind the fireplace in my dressing-room.
Attempts to exactly locate the sound or see up the chimney were
abortive. Nothing could be felt by putting the arm up the chimney.

<bodyText confidence="0.999319916666667" page_id="56216071"  page_num="293" year="" vol="">
This noise went on for three days. On the morning of the fourth
day a very dirty and battered white Fan-tail Pigeon made its appearance
in my dressing-room. It walked, or rather staggered, into the bedroom.
I gave him some water and I thought the poor little beggar would
never stop drinking. I then gave him some food and put him into
an old Parrot cage. We kept him till he was well and strong and
then gave him to a neighbour to whom he belonged. He joined the
others, who showed great joy to see him again. What had happened
was that he apparently had been sitting on the chimney-pot with
his little tail up when a gust of wind tipped him down the
chimney.
The next was a young Hove that had left the nest before it could
fly properly. It fell into my front garden and was caught by a cat.
It was rescued before much harm was done.
We took him in and fed him. Feeding young Pigeons and Doves
is difficult since, I believe, the young birds put their beaks into the
mouths of their parents when they are fed and it is difficult to get them
to open their beaks. One has to open the beak and force the -food
down. It is surprising how soon this bird learnt the trick of opening
his mouth. I have a little instrument, in several sizes, which I always
keep by me for feeding young birds. It is a short length of glass
tubing with a piston made of wood to fit it. The piston is withdrawn
and food forced into the tube and the piston replaced. When the
bird opened its beak the tube is pushed into the mouth well back
behind the tongue, and the piston forced home. The food is thus
deposited into the bird's mouth. It is a very handy little instrument.
I got this idea from a very old friend of mine who has brought up
many young birds and is a past master at it. All the young birds
I have reared have been fed this way and appear to greatly appreciate
it. This Dove learned the trick quickly and was no trouble.
My daughter brought him up and he got very fond of her and used
to play with her. When she went into the room he would fly to her
and settle on her head or hand and when on the floor would pretend to
fight with her. He would beat her with his wings and peck her, cooing
all the time. He would follow her everywhere and when taken into
the garden would fly round and come back to her.

My next was another Pigeon. This baby had got himself into
a gutter-head at my Hospital. There was a wire netting over this
gutter-head expressly to prevent Pigeons from nesting there. I think
he must have fallen down from above. There was no possibility of his
getting out. His parents were feeding him. I got a ladder and rescued
him and brought him home in my pocket. He was a nice friendly
little bird just fledged with all his baby down on the ends of his feathers.
I had the same difficulty in feeding this bird as with the other, but
he very soon learnt to open his mouth and all went well.
He did well and got very tame. He would fly round the garden
and come back and firmly refused to take his liberty.
The next two were small Sparrows. I have always wanted to
have a Sparrow. I am very fond of them. These two I caught young.
The first had his feet 44 balled up " with (?) mud. They looked like
a pair of little club feet. I washed the mud off and he was able to
hop about quite well. I think it was on account of the condition
of his feet that he had fallen from the nest, as he couldn't hold on.
He could fly very little and only low to the ground, and was in imminent
danger of the cats. I took him in and fed him. There was no difficulty
about this. He took his food well, perhaps too well. He was very
fond of meal worms, and I should be afraid to say how many he would
eat "at a sitting ". He became perfectly tame and very cheeky.
But after a few days he had several fits and died. Whether he was
injured in his fall or his feeding wrong or too much I don't know.
However, he did not live many days. I was very sorry to lose him.
The other was just the same, though his feet were not " balled up ".
He died after a few days of fits.
The next three were baby Starlings. These I caught, having
left the nest before they could fly. They were easy to feed and took
their food well. They were fed four times a day and given as much
as they would take each time. But first one died and then another,
till at the end of a week all had died. I could not make out what was
wrong as they seemed to be doing well. In the evening they seemed
very fit and in the morning one after the other died. I had a post-
mortem made on the last of them. The report showed that in spite
of the enormous quantity of food it had had there was no sign of food

in the crop, stomach, or intestine. The bird had, in fact, died of
starvation. Apparently it is necessary to feed these small birds very
frequently. Perhaps every ten minutes and with a small quantity
each time.
My next was a young Sparrow, a little hen. She landed on the
running board of my car one morning as I was taking it out of the
garage. I picked her up and put her into a little cage. Profiting by
my experience with the Starlings I took her everywhere with me. I took
a pocketful of mealworms and a small tinful of bread and milk. I
had to feed her forcibly at first, but by the end of the day she had
learned not to be frightened and took her food from the " tube
For many days this bird accompanied me everywhere. She did well
and was soon able to feed herself. She still liked me to feed her when-
ever I came near.
As soon as she could fly I let her out in my room at intervals to
stretch herself. She became very tame and friendly. I then put
her in a large cage, but she seemed distressed and kept fluttering
against the bars. I really think she did not like the large cage, having
been used to the little one. I thought she was unhappy so I let her go.
She had not been with me long and I judged she was well able to take
care of herself and she was very strong on the wing. I was sorry when
she left. She would have become a great pal.
My last two were Carrion Crows. I got these last Whitsun. A
farmer friend of mine had shot the parents and knocked the babies
out of the nest.
They were quite little with very scanty covering and tails
just little rows of stumpy quills. I had no intention of letting
these birds die of starvation, and, as my wife flatly refused
to " nurse any more sick birds ", I took them everywhere with
me. I put them in a basket with some hay and fed them
on raw meat. Feeding was easy. They had very large mouths
which they opened very wide. There was more mouth than bird.
There was no need to use the tube. I put a spot of cod-liver oil
on some of the meat to prevent rickets. They did not like the oil
very much, but I got them going on meat without oil and then put in an
oily bit. Once it was well behind the tongue it went down all right.

When they were thirsty I trickled water down their mouths from
a swab of cotton wool. They liked this and when they had had enough
they used to throw the head forward and let the water dribble out.
It seemed to amuse them to do this. The weather was very hot at
this time and as they seemed to feel the heat I used to turn back the
lid of the basket and put them on the top to cool down. They&amp;apos; would
lie on the basket lid in most extraordinary attitudes. They looked
as if they were dead. In fact some of my patients thought they were
dead and asked me what I was going to do with them. I had only
to go up to them and say " Boys ! " and they would spring to life and
open their beaks wide.
They did well and in about a week began to try to stand. As
soon as they could get on their legs I took them into the garden one
morning to let them have a try at walking. The stronger and more
forward bird of the two first trundled about on his " elbows ". He
gradually got up on to his feet and commenced to walk. He seemed
very pleased with this and started off to explore the garden, walking
well, and every now and then giving a little jump. I took some cinema
photographs of him. These photographs show that he had a slight
limp which is interesting from what followed. He made his way to
the far end of the garden and I went up to bring him back and, as I picked
him up, he fluttered a little as if he wanted to escape. I put him down
to get a better grip and to my horror found he was completely paralyzed
in both legs. He was very frightened. I put him back in the basket.
The other one stayed about in the same place and did not get right
up on his feet.
The paralyzed one settled down in about an hour and seemed free
from pain. I was now in a difficulty since I had to have two baskets
and a bag to carry about with me. I have to make a journey to the
country twice a week to attend my clinics and I always go by train.
To get over the difficulty I decided to drive down so that I could
take my birds. Unfortunately on the way home I had an accident
and my car was wrecked. We had to hire another car to get back.
I was now in a worse hole than ever as it was quite impossible
to manage the two. However, my wife came to the rescue, relented,
and took charge of the well bird. He was now nearly able to feed

himself. The sick one went everywhere with me. He seemed quite
happy and took his food well. Gradually the use of his legs began to
come back and he began to raise himself up. The right leg was in
a state of flaccid palsy and the left somewhat spastic adducted with
the foot inverted. I thought he had probably had a haemorrhage into
the cord or possibly a fractured pelvis due to his fall, one or the
other having been made worse by the exercise he had taken.
I had him X-rayed. The X-ray showed no sign of fracture
anywhere.
During the next month he went on improving. He got movement
in both legs and the legs became stronger. I used to take him out of
the basket at frequent intervals and give him passive movements.
Later he was able to sit on the top of his basket, though he was very
unsteady. He soon got tired and I put him back. He was a very
knowing bird and knew the daily routine quite well. I think he
enjoyed his travelling and in the train seemed to take an interest in
his surroundings. I always had the lid of the basket open. At the
end of the month he did not appear so well and his legs got weaker.
He became more restless. He was now unable to sit on the top of the
basket. I used to put him there and arrange his feet for him but he
was not comfortable and was always glad to be put back. I made
a little cradle for him. Mechanically it was sound but he did not
like it. I find wild birds and animals cannot tolerate anything in the
shape of restraint. All I could do was to wedge him up with hay.
The day after he appeared not so well he became definitely weaker
and was very restless. He couldn't settle down at all. When he
was in the basket he wanted to be out and when out tried to get off
the basket. He was very strong in the wings and flapped them
violently. His nerves seemed to be " on edge ". While sitting
propped up on the top of the basket he suddenly flapped his wings
in an attempt to get off and fell over the side. It was only a few inches
from the floor, but I was not quick enough to catch him and he got one
of his claws caught in the basket and injured his leg. After this I
could do nothing with him. He became quite wild. I could not
induce him to take any food, and the only way I could quieten him
was to put him in this basket in the dark.

The following morning he was worse. He was quite wild. I am
sure he did not know me. He kept flapping his wings. His legs were
completely paralyzed again. I think he was in pain so reluctantly
I gave him some chloroform. When he was under I examined him
carefully. I found he had a fracture of the tibia just above the ankle-
joint on the right and a green-stick fracture of the left calcis. The
former, I think, was due to his fall the night before, and the latter
probably an old fracture dating from his original fall. It was probably
refractured again during his exertions. I gave him more chloroform
and so ended his little life. It is interesting from a pathological point
of view, but a sad ending after six weeks' nursing.

MELANISM IN ORNAMENTAL FINCHES

By Godfrey Davis, I.C.S.
Some few T months back I saw in the Editorial in the Avicultural
Magazine a reference to melanism in a Peter's Fire Finch. I have
always attributed melanism, which constantly occurs in Avadavats in
captivity, to a diet of hard seed. A visit to the Bird House in the Zoo
will show how dark Avadavats become in captivity and how the deep
crimson of the wild bird is lost. I thought that a diet of half-ripe seeds
would preserve the colour of these little birds, but a recent experience
with some that were caught near here and brought to me has led me
to believe that diet is not the only contributing factor, and that an
essential factor to the formation and retention of the deep crimson
is rain.
Some weeks ago--to be precise on 19th July--a Waghri, a man of a
jungle caste, brought me a dozen cock Avadavats which he had netted.
Most of them were coming into colour and that colour was a deep
crimson. I had that night to go away and had not time to see the
birds till the following Wednesday when, to my surprise, the deep
crimson had changed to a bright red. I was much surprised and
thought the reason must have been that in the period of my absence,
only a few days, they had been kept in the bungalow and fed on hard
seed. I had them put out in the garden in the morning and evening ;

had them fed on half-ripe seed, and I had them left out in their
bamboo cage in the rain. Some other Avadavats which I had, which had
been fed on hard seed and were a brickish-yellow red, I kept as controls.
I did not think sunlight was a contributing factor because we were
having very little sun ; the days were clouded and rainy. After a time
the fresh-caught birds regained their proper colour and I had made
up my mind to write to you to say that Avadavats fed on half-ripe
seed would assume the colour of the wild birds, but I was busy and
delayed. And then to my surprise the birds started to lose the crimson
again. In most cases the colour went a bright Vermillion and in the
case of one bird particularly, which was much less advanced in colour
than the others, the feathers were a very light brick red, indeed
almost yellow.
I was extremely puzzled and disappointed. Apparently the secret
still eluded me. It was not food alone. Last Sunday I went out into
the fields to see the crops which were reported to be suffering from
want of rain as for the last fortnight we have had a dry spell of weather.
I went by a lake and saw the Samo-grass on which it is said
wild Avadavats at this season live, and I plucked some, and I noticed
the ground was reeking with moisture. Then I remembered the Waghri
had told me, when questioned, that those Avadavats were of the finest
colour which lived by the banks of rivers and were always bathing.
I did not attach much importance to that then, but the recent changes
in the colour of my birds made me think that there was something in
it. I gathered a large bunch of the Samo-grass and returned, and I
determined to leave the birds out in the rain and watch. - Unfortunately,
so certain had I been that half-ripe seeds were the decisive factor, that
I had released the birds which I had kept as controls. The dry spell
broke on the Monday and for the last six days I have left the birds
out in their bamboo cage in the rain and let them soak. The result has
been interesting because to-day the birds have lost the bright vermillion
colour and have become a deep crimson with the exception of two birds
which had really started to come into colour during the dry spell,
and the feathers of these are not crimson but brick red, in one case
almost yellow. Can it be that rain has some effect on the pigment of
the feathers and that without this contributing factor the crimson

pigment does not form ? And is this why the red of the Redpoll changes
to yellow in captivity and then finally disappears \ Whatever be the
cause, I am now convinced that the two chief factors in the crimson
colour of the Avadavats are half-ripe seeds and rain. I do not think
sunlight and temperature are of much importance because some of
the finest coloured Avadavats I have seen, the bird dealer told me,
came from Kashmir. And in the monsoon here, when the colour of the
wild birds must be forming, the sun is often hidden by clouds and rain.
Is any member of the Society sufficiently interested to put a few cock
Avadavats in a bamboo cage, feed them on half-ripe seeds and keep
them in the rain, and watch ; or if not Avadavats, then Linnets or
Redpolls ? I do not think an outdoor aviary would serve the same
purpose (1) because the diet could not be controlled ; and (2) because
the birds would in all probability take shelter from the rain. In the
monsoon rain in India the wild birds must be wet for hours together.

COD-LIVER OIL

Sir, --The value of cod-liver oil as a food for livestock is becoming
increasingly widely recognized, and a German Budgerigar breeder
recently declared Canary seed soaked in cod-liver oil to be infallible
as a preventative of egg-binding.
An experiment I have just tried with a pair of Brown's Parrakeets
has also given results unmistakably favourable to the use of cod-liver
oil. The hen of this pair mated to a cock now dead but apparently
a perfect specimen in every way, produced in 1927 hopelessly rickety
young in a wooden nest-box in the aviary shelter.
Last year, in a natural, earth-filled tree trunk in the aviary shelter,
she reared three young birds which were fair specimens, though nothing
out of the ordinary, and not too strong on the wing for the first few
days. She was mated to a different male, her present companion.
Last autumn she was very badly injured by the cock and took
weeks to recover from the mauling she received. He also, during the

died of starvation when his tongue was bitten in a fight, and for weeks
he could not eat proper food. They were therefore anything but a
promising breeding pair for 1929 and I was rather surprised when
they nested and had fertile eggs. When the three young birds hatched
I supplied, in addition to the ordinary seed mixture, a dish of hemp
and sunflower which had been soaked for two or three days in a vessel
of veterinary cod-liver oil which had been exposed to the sunlight.
The cock partook freely of this seed and I have never, even at liberty.,
bred better Broadtails than these young Browns--big, strong, and
quick to mature. I ought, perhaps, to add that they were on peat-
moss, which I find a healthier nest-lining than earth, and that, owing to
the presence of a large hole in the tree trunk close to nest level, they
had an unusual amount of light and fresh air. I think, however, that
it was mainly the cod-liver oil that did the trick and next year I intend
to make further experiments with Parrakeets that are actually rearing
young. Some species, like Turquoisines, do not seem to like the taste
of the oil-soaked seed and will hardly touch it, while, as part of the
general food of Parrot-like birds, it is probably much too rich and
stimulating. For special occasions, however, it may be a valuable
supplement to the ordinary diet.

MASKED LOVEBIRDS AT LIBERTY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978906" page_id="56216079"  page_num="301" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have been successful in breeding the Masked Lovebird at
liberty. A couple (I am not sure that they were a true pair) passed
through the recent severe winter in safety and in May I released four
more. When I returned home in September there were three old
birds to be seen about the garden whose not too friendly attitude
towards each other argued the possibility of sitting mates. The other
day, while watching birds coming in to drink and bathe at the shrinking
remnants of the drought-stricken pond, my attention was attracted
by a Masked Lovebird whose colouration seemed less brilliant than that
of an adult and the glass quickly confirmed the fact that it was a hue,

well-grown youngster. Others have since appeared and now feed with
the parents on the seed tray.
As I have said before, Agapornis personata seems well worth a more
extensive trial as a liberty bird, being, by reason of its roosting habits,
one of the very few small Parrakeets which are safe from the Brown
Owl. All that is needed is an adequate supply of logs and boxes
fastened to the trunks of large trees at a fair height from the ground
and provided with unenlargeable entrance holes which will admit a
Lovebird but exclude a Starling. At least one box must be supplied
for every two birds and, as the stock increases by breeding, so must
the supply of boxes be at once increased. It appears to be the habit
of these Lovebirds to seek out and prepare for their fully-fledged
young a dormitory as soon as they have left the home nest. Such
concern for the housing of their almost independent offspring is unusual
among birds, but is probably necessary to the continuance of the
species, a Lovebird without a sleeping log being not only exposed to
the attacks of many nocturnal enemies, but also prone to contract
a bad chill.
At liberty Masked Lovebirds appear exceedingly inoffensive. I have
never known them damage fruit, fruit-tree buds, or flowers ; and so
long as they are not molested, they show no inclination to attack
other birds, even when they are feeding on the same tray.
Although in confinement not particularly keen on green food, at
liberty they spend a good deal of time seeking delicacies among the
turf, and when so engaged present a pretty and attractive sight.

PEEVE'S PHEASANTS IN AUSTRALIA

Sir, --The June issue of the Avicultural Magazine is just to hand,
and, through a letter from Mr. G. Beever on Reeve's Pheasants and an
editorial article entitled " A Fine Collection of Papuan Birds ", is of
more than usual interest to the writer. Mr. F. S. Mayer, who is
responsible for Mr. Sped an Lewis' rare collection of birds, is a friend
and neighbour of mine here, and is indirectly associated with the

appended narrative which has considerable bearing on Mr. Beever's
query about barren hens and infertility associated with this handsome
Pheasant.
Some three years ago Mr. Mayer returned from the homeland with
a large collection of birds, including two pairs of Reeves. I at that
time owned a pair of this species, the hen a generous layer and all
eggs fertile, but the chickens difficult to rear.
I was pleased to have the opportunity of securing the two imported
pairs from Mr. Mayer, and, being rather limited in accommodation
for my various sorts, parted with my Australian-bred Reeves and duly
installed the healthy and good-looking Britishers. Later I disposed of
one of the above pairs, and as the initial breeding month for Pheasant
hens here is October, I anxiously awaited results. The season extends
to about the end of the year, and during that time the birds regularly
visited the usual laying seclusion, but not an egg was produced. I
interpreted the disappointing feature to the change of season and
awaited another year's result.
The second season ended with exactly similar results--not an egg,
although both birds were apparently healthy. Having always a great
liking for this Pheasant, I wrote to the purchaser of the second pair,
asking for his experience with the birds and could he sell me a young
pair from them. Here is his reply " The Reeves have not laid an
egg during the two seasons, and I do not think they will, as every
opportunity has been in their favour."
The above are two more instances of non-laying as mentioned by
Mr. Beever, who is desirous to know if any reader can explain.
I have had twelve years' experience with Reeves, and never
previously knew or heard of a barren hen. My conclusion is that the
non-laying is probably an inherent trait in some English strains, and
those introduced by Mr. Mayer may have been related to these.
Regarding infertile eggs, the most extensive Pheasant breeder in
Australia is Mr. Alan Jaques, of Balwyn, Victoria, his stock of eight
or nine varieties frequently reaching 300.
Occasionally, when I am short of a bird, I have only to write to
him, and in two or three days I have it by rail, a 17-hour journey from
Melbourne (Victoria) to Sydney.

Correspondence
As the breeding season is approaching, and being anxious to have a
pair of Reeves, I communicated with Mr. Jaques some days ago.
His reply is as follows : " Last year I had one Reeves chicken out of
fifty-four eggs. All the eggs were infertile. I have four old hens and
two old cocks, so you see I want new blood badly."
Here is another case of defect in the breed--infertility--to which
Mr. Beever refers. Mr. Jaques thinks it is want of new blood, and has
some Reeves on the way from England. It is hoped his experience
with them will not be similar to those referred to in this communication.
Perhaps some readers may attribute the non-laying and infertility
mentioned to our climatic conditions, and to dispel this supposition
I may mention that all other varieties of Pheasants breed freely, an
infertile egg being a rarity. An instance being that accompanying
Mr. Mayer's Reeves from England were Amhersts, Yulturine Guinea
Fowls and White Peacocks, all of which bred well with their respective
owners.
A future contribution may be in relation to my first season's
experience with Peacock Pheasants.

ORIGINAL COLOUR OF BUDGERIGAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994334923076923" page_id="56216082"  page_num="304" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The following is an extract from an article I wrote for our
Magazine, August, 1918 :--
" I cannot help thinking that generations ago the original colour
of the Budgerigar was blue, and the yellow has been developed as a
more protective colour from the sun. Mr. Willsum and the Rev. J. M.
Patterson both agree that Blues must be bred and kept in the shade.
In the common Greens the nest plumage is more or less blue, and we
know that in all nature, the colour of the young indicates the original
colour of the bird or beast. Then, again, blue or grey-blue appears to
be a primary colour of nature.
" Therefore, it seems quite possible that if Budgerigars were originally
blue, the yellow (a protective colour) came in and produced the green,
according to the rule of the survival of the fittest . .

Since writing the above, several things have occurred which I think
makes it worth while to refer to it again. If the yellow pigment came
into the blue and white plumage by reason of environment (strong light
or certain kinds of foods) and produced a green and yellow bird, the
next change may have been for the blue pigment to disappear altogether,
and a yellow bird produced. We know that many yellow Parrakeets
have been found in a wild state, showing that the yellow pigment has
entirely eliminated the blue.
A blue Lovebird and several blue Parrakeets have been found in a
wild state, and may possibly be a throw-back to a remote ancestor.
This theory seems to be somewhat strengthened by an article on
" The Yellow-breasted Cissa " by Mon. Delacour in our Magazine,
December, 1927, and other articles and letters on colour changes.
From M. Delacour's article, it appears that in the shade and with-
out animal food, the Cissa moults out blue and white, but as a strong
light on a preserved skin has the same effect it would appear that in
this case animal food has more to do with colour change than light.
Many white substances, if left exposed to the sun and atmosphere,
turn yellow.
White poultry for show purposes are entirely ruined if kept in a
strong light or fed on Indian corn : they get a strong yellow tint in their
plumage.
In reference to the Cissa, if my theory is correct, it would appear
that the change in colour was much later than in the Budgerigar, as a
yellow Cissa is not known up to now, and the yellow pigment does
not seem to be so fixed . . .
It would be interesting to know the nest plumage of this bird.
John W. Marsden.
[It is difficult to see how the question as to what was the original
colour of the Budgerigar or the ancestor from which it sprang can
ever be proved, but since green is a more common colour in Parrots
than blue, why should it ever have been otherwise ? The blue
Budgerigar of captivity is a degenerate creature that is lacking in one
of the pigments that make up the normal colour of the species, just as
an albino is lacking in all pigment. Would Mr. Marsden suggest that

a white Blackbird represented the original type of its species and that

frequents the mountains of the interior of Tonkin, and is the bird
which Bonaparte introduced to the scientific world by describing
it from a few tail-feathers preserved in the Paris Museum. Since then
some specimens were sent to the museums in Europe and America,
but the birds which Mr. J. Delacour took back with him to France
recently are the very first living specimens of the Crested Argus
Pheasant to be seen in the living state.
Mr. Delacour sent me a pair of this wonderful Pheasant when he
came to Japan in 1925, after completing his tour in Indo-China, but
the female died in transit. Mr. Delacour was good enough to send me
another female afterwards. Just at that time the house I am now
living in was in course of construction, so for a time I kept the male
and female separately in my small aviaries.
In 1927 I had my new aviaries finished and put both male and
female in one aviary ; they are now living very happily together
and I have not seen them quarrel once. They spend all day long in
the bush which I have had planted in the aviary, and roost on a high
perch at night. About February the male commences to cry 44 Ho-
Hoo ", with a voice that sounds like a whistle, and in March he began

to display. So far as I have seen it first erects its crest, turns this
forward until the front edge touches its head and unfolds the white
part of the inner side of the crest until it has the appearance of the
flower of a thistle. It draws in its neck, pressing it to the body, and
raises its long tail until it reaches about the same height as the head.
It then shapes itself just like a straight-lined broad tape from the
head to the tail. It runs round the female and stops every now and
then, lowers its neck a little, and opens its wings. It does not seem
to perform a grand display like that of the Argus Pheasant.
In May, 1928, the female laid some eggs, but as I left an open space
in my aviary large enough for the display of the male, and the bush
being too light, there was not a place which the hen considered suitable
for her eggs. She dropped all the eggs from the perch and they were
smashed to pieces. The eggs numbered five in all. Thinking that
she might probably lay her eggs in the dark-roofed part of the aviary,
I placed a nesting-box close to the ground under the roofed part and
had another one placed higher and close to the roof, but the hen used
neither of these. Accordingly I began planting a large number of
trees during last winter up to this spring before the birds were in their
breeding season, and this made a very thick bush in my aviary this
year.
About February I began to hear the note " Ho-Hoo " of the male
again, and in March he was seen to display furiously. In a short
while the female too began to utter " Hoo-hoo " in single note, and
on the 16th April she laid the first egg. It was laid in a very shallow,
hollow place that she had made inside the bush in one corner of the
aviary. I took away the egg at once and the hen laid another one
the day after next, the 18th, and stopped laying for some length of
time. The first egg had a reddish-buff ground with numerous small
brown dots, but the second had a paler ground-colour and was much
less spotted than the first one. Eggs measured 64 by 46 and 63&amp;apos;
by 45 mm.
For a-few days after the hen had stopped laying the parent birds
showed no further inclination to breed. After a while the male began to
display again, and the female also showed- signs of breeding, and she
laid an egg on the 10th and another on the 12th of May ; next, on the

31st May and 2nd June, and again on the 29th June and 1st July.
She laid four clutches of eggs in all this year and then began moulting.
I let a Bantam hen sit on the two eggs of the first clutch on the
25th April; the second clutch on the 27th May ; the third on 17th June,
and the fourth clutch on the 8th July. All the embryos began to
break their shells with their bills on the 24th day of incubation, and
they were completely hatched on the 25th day.
Primaries of the chick are well developed from birth, and three
days after they are hatched their tail-feathers begin to grow. Its
subsequent development is shown in the accompanying photographs.
The coloration of the chicks of five days old is as follows. Body,
all dark chocolate brown ; there are three broad black lines running
from the upper back to the tail, exhibiting yellowish-buff in the parts
between the lines. The wing-feathers and the greater coverts are dark
brown, with irregular bars of rusty-buff. A dark line runs from the
back of the eyes to the ear-coverts and another line branches out at a
little way off the back of the eyes and unites with the other line on the
opposite side after running through the hind part of the occiput.
Tail-feathers are very short and their colour is similar to that of the
wing-feathers. Bill, fleshy; base, dark ; legs and toes are pale
fleshy-brown. About one month after it is hatched the legs become
dark greyish brown.
The third out of the total four clutches did not hatch as the
foster-mother hen quit sitting on the eggs on account of the sudden
and excessive rise in temperature. A chick of the first clutch died
and proved to be a female. All the others are very hardy and growing
in perfect health. Chicks are dieted for the first few days on lettuce
chopped fine mixed with some Italian millet. They are fed, there-
after, with a mixture of one part sorghum and one part seeds of the
panic-grass, mixed with minced dried fish well moistened with water at
first, and the water is gradually drawn off.

By E. J. Boosey and Alec Brooksbank
Last year we were concerned mainly with breeding-up our stock,
and this, our first " selling " season, the following of the rarer
Australian Parrakeets have successfully reared young here :--Many-
colours, Barrabands, Brown's. 1
A. pair of Malabars, being young ones bred last year, did not come
into breeding condition until about a month ago when, although
they were anxious to do so, it was too late to allow them to breed ;
and the same applies to a young hen Malabar mated to a cock Plumhead.
Among the less common Finches an aviary containing four pairs
of Red-headed Gouldians has perhaps proved more successful than
is usual with these birds, eighteen young ones being already fledged,
while a nest of four more are about half-grown and another hen is
incubating five eggs.
It is, of course, late in the season to " count one's chickens before
they are hatched ", or even, as in the case of the five half-grown young,
when they are hatched, but it seems nevertheless that as eighteen
are already fledged we may with luck and a continuance of the mild
weather rear as many as twenty-four young from the four pairs.
Some of these will be the second generation bred here, as three of
the parents were our own young ones of last year. It is satisfactory
to hear from one of our customers of a young Gouldian that we sent
him that " it appears appreciably larger in size than several other
imported specimens I have at present and is altogether a fine bird " ;
particularly as we have found this to be the case ourselves, when
comparing our own imported birds with their English-bred progeny.
It may possibly be of interest to mention here that, from the corre-
spondence we have had with customers wanting young Gouldians,
it would seem that many people are not aware that these birds do not
1 These birds are a pair we are housing for Lord Tavistock until he moves into
a healthier bird district than Warblington, and they have young in the nest again
as we write, though whether these ever emerge is doubtful, as we fear they may
succumb to the colder nights as soon as their mother stops brooding them.
[The young Brown's is still alive (17th November), and looks as though it may
successfully leave the nest in the course of 10 days or so. The number of young
Gouldians successfully reared from 4 pairs totals 23.]

come into colour for at least nine months ; the change from the sober
green of the nestling to the brilliance of the adult being a comparatively
sudden one. The only indication as to sex is that young cocks may
sometimes be seen practising the Gouldian " song and dance " at
a tender age, but even this is unreliable since they usually stop and
fly off as soon as one approaches near enough to identify the dancer !
Cocks may sometimes be distinguished from hens by the shape of the
skull, but on the whole it is best to consider young Gouldians as
unsexable, for all practical purposes, until they reach full maturity.
Approximately 300 young Zebra Finches have been reared from
thirty pairs, but although in theory this constitutes an average of
ten young from each pair, in practice some extra prolific individual pairs
have produced as many as twenty young ones, other fifteen, other ten,
and so on, while one pair at least has produced none at all.
Of Diamond Doves about fifty have been reared, in spite of the
fact that Doves are careless parents.
Budgerigars of all colours, of which large numbers have been bred,
have averaged about twelve young a pair, several Greys having
appeared, which are not just inferior Mauves but a true French Grey.
We have also bred many Blue, Cobalt, Mauve and Grey-washed-
Whites, but though in many cases their markings are unusually dark,
we hesitate to call them Silverwings as there seems to be a good deal
of divergence of opinion as to what actually constitutes a Silverwing.
It seems curious that one never sees mention of Yellow-washed-Whites
being produced as these should be particularly lovely.
All our birds are kept in unheated, movable outdoor aviaries.

We fully hoped to remain a long time in Trinidad, but the wet
climate proved too much for us, so we had to give it up after a year.
I had hoped to have collected a large variety of the birds from round
about us, but on arrival I learnt that there had been a law passed
prohibiting persons from caging or taking any birds. I soon found
that many persons still had some birds, though not in the town, so
I wrote to the Colonial Secretary and after a very long delay obtained

permission and started, though too late in the breeding season, to try
and get nests for hand-rearing. Herewith a few notes of what I got
and what I brought back with me.
The first nest of the Common Loon Bird ; family, Tyrannidse;
very brilliant yellow and black, very noisy but very easy to rear.
In their own woven nest, nearly 14 inches long and shaped like a bottle,
they lived in the verandah, and soon learnt to fly up into a mango-
tree for safety at night. They returned for four months to eat bread
and milk, but after that joined up with the other flocks of the same
species and I saw them no more.
One thing is very curious about the birds in Trinidad. They seem
to go about in big flocks, like our Starlings, all the year until the
breeding season, and then directly the young can fly and feed they
pack again. They fight and quarrel continually, even the tiny Humming
Birds fight until the feathers fall, and chase each other from the best-
liked flower really viciously.
The next birds I got were a nest of Coerebidse, the Venezuelan
Flower Pecker (Coereba luteola). They are very small, black with
bright canary yellow breasts and a white streak over the eye and
curved beaks. The Palois name is " Sucriers ", or " Sugar Eaters
These build a nest of moss, which hangs from all the cocoa-trees,
lining it with strips of banana leaves, and some cotton flower. They
do not seem very particular, as, though this nest was made like a Wren's
with entrance low down at side, the next nest I got was flat and made
of stiff grass and lined with cotton.
I brought these birds up on Mellin's Food and honey and bread and
milk. They still prefer the bread and milk to anything, but drink
the Mellin's. Of course they get any fruit going.
I saw the hen bird feeding, and it seemed to be digested honey
and nothing else. The parents are most devoted to their young,
and the parents of mine would not go away, and eventually actually
got one young one away. They have a pretty little song, are very
lively and bathe a great deal, charming pets for aviary. We have
successfully brought home twenty-four small birds, and they are,
in spite of very cold wet weather, healthy and lively. They consist of :

The rarest and most lovely birds I had from Trinidad died on the
journey. They were a pair of Jacamars (Galbula ruficauda), hand-
reared. It was terribly cold by the Azores and they both died. They
are most beautiful birds about 8 inches in length, the top of the head
peacock-blue, shot like a Peacock. The head, nape of neck, and back
are shot gold and green, the underparts soft chocolate, the throat
white in the male and buff in the female.
The birds of Trinidad are wonderful, and we noted the Mot-mot
or King of the Wood, the Snowy Egret, Humming Birds of half a
dozen species, fifteen species of Tanagers, Woodpeckers, Wood Hewers,
Tyrants or Kiskadees, six species of Honey-eaters (Coerchidse), and
Hang-nests, including the Great Crested Cassique (Ostinops

By Dr. M. Amsler
The following is an account of a partial failure on my part to breed
these charming birds on intensive lines.
In the autumn of 1926 I received a pair of adult birds in perfect
condition from the Zoological Society, and straightway I made a vow
that they should not have cause to regret their generosity. I guarded
these birds as the apple of my eye throughout the winter which they
spent in a cage kept indoors in my bird-room which is frost-proof
except in the coldest weather. In March, 1927, I turned the birds out,
and I have already written a short account of their refusal to nest in
the shelter of the aviary, and of their immediate choice of a box within
a few seconds of its being hung in the outer flight.
The result of this nest was three young, of which one died after
leaving the nest.
By an exchange I was able to obtain a mate for one of my young
hens, and I started the season of 1928 with two adult pairs.

Dr. M. Amslei--Blue Bobins
We will call the old pair No. 1 and the youngsters No. 2.
During 1928 the two pairs, which were of course in separate aviaries,
hatched out sixteen young of which four or five lived to leave the
nest and not one of which survived for more than a couple of months.
Post-mortem reports on two or three of the dead youngsters showed
that they had died of " enteritis "--a very elastic term. This was all
very disappointing, as the birds are so ready to nest and are really
very well-meaning parents.
During the winter of 1928-9 I thought a good deal about my
Blue Birds, and decided that I would produce some healthy young
by fair means or foul.
I was very jealous and not a little annoyed that Monsieur Plocq. of
La Roche-sur-Yon in the Vendee, had reared quite a number of young
from one pair, but I suspected that he had not played the game. So
I wrote to him in my best Prench, laid my cards on the table, and
told him that I intended this year to use foster parents or to give the
birds their liberty in my small garden.
With typical French courtesy he wrote me a long letter, and it
transpired that he had had much the same experience as myself--
the young not ever living to leave the nest. He had tried removing
the cock with indifferent success, and finally had hand-reared quite
a number of young from a few days of age.
Most of us know that M. Plocq is a genius in the rearing of delicate
softbills and, indeed, of all sorts of birds, and he had little difficulty
with the Blue Robins. This again w r as somewhat disappointing,
as the hand-rearing of birds is hardly a pastime for one of my profession.
As the spring approached I asked a few of my friends to look out
for nests of Robin Redbreasts and in the meantime turned out my
two pairs of Blue Birds into their respective breeding aviaries. No. 1
pair were put in an enclosure some 30 feet by 10 feet together with
a few small birds such as Parrot Finches and Waxbills, they at once
took possession of the old box which they had used in 1927 and 1928,
and by 1st May had laid five eggs, which by the way is the usual clutch.
Meanwhile, everyone was feverishly hunting for a suitable wild Robin's
nest, and it is extraordinary how difficult it is to find the right article
when you want it. I had several reliable people on the look-out--

bird-watchers, oologists, and bird-ringers--either the nest was not
ready or the young had hatched, or the nest was in too public a position.
At last a nest was discovered in a private garden : it was built in the
ivy covering an outhouse some 12 feet from the ground and appeared
to be an ideal site for my experiment. On 12th May my five Blue
Robin's eggs, which had been incubated for twelve or thirteen days,
were substituted for those of the Redbreasts ; on chipping the latter
I judged that the embryos were only four or five days old, and wondered
whether the foster-parents would object to their premature and very
large chicks if ever they appeared.
With some difficulty I kept away from that nest for a full week ;
when I again visited the spot the first sign of life was a Redbreast with
an insect in its bill, with hopes rising high I got a ladder and looked
into the nest, and to my delight found five young Blue Robins, gaping
and fat and about four days old.
Another week's w T ait and again I saw a Robin carrying live food,
but at the same time I also noticed a black Manx cat in the distance,
which appeared to have something in its mouth : in fear and trembling
I looked into the nest and sure enough there was only one chick left,
by no means ready to fly but obviously a Blue Bird judging from the
colour at the base of the quills.
I then tracked that cat to the gardener's cottage, and as I approached
the loathsome beast dropped something which on closer examination
proved its guilt, and if I had had a gun handy that cat would have
gone to a hell where it was forced to eat Blue Birds until it exploded !
There was nothing left for me to do but to take the young bird. I
easily trapped the two Redbreasts, and within the hour they were
feeding their foster-child, which I had placed in their cage in an
improvised nest. By 16th June the young Blue Robin, which is now
a fine cock in full colour, was independent, and I liberated the Red-
breasts, who disappeared at once and never attempted to visit their
infant, whose cage stood all day in the garden. Meantime, No. 1
pair had laid five more eggs, which I placed under a Great Tit on
28th May. Three of the eggs hatched on 11th June, and by the 20th
two of these chicks had died ; the survivor lingered on for another
wxek, and when he finally perished looked much like a bird of a week

or ten days ; it was obvious that the food provided by the Tits was
not entirely suitable, and I suspect that they use a certain amount of
vegetable food. Indeed, I remember that when I bred the Great Tit
here in 1915 the old birds used quite a lot of sunflower seed,, and
anything of this nature would obviously disagree with young Blue
Robins.
By 6th June the old pair of Blue Birds had produced five eggs
again, and these I placed, on 11th June, under a Redbreast which
a kind patient had found for me.
We knew nothing of this last Robins' nest except that they were
sitting on eggs and when I proceeded to remove these I found that
two were chipping and that one chick was almost out of the shell.
It was too late to take my own eggs home so I took the risk and put
them in instead of the three Robin's eggs with small hope that the
foster-parents would begin again as it were and sit another five or six
days. I was kept in telephonic communication as to the movements
of the birds : first " they are sitting tight " and a few days later,
" three chicks have hatched." I consider this very wonderful, for the
Redbreasts must surely have felt and heard their own eggs chipping,
notwithstanding which they continued to sit steadily for another
six days on eggs which were obviously not their own. Possibly they
were attracted by the size and colour of the present I had made them !
My next news was that one of the chicks had disappeared, and a
couple of days later that one had been picked up on the ground with
a wound on its body. It was obviously time to interfere, so again I
took away the chick which was now ten days old, and set my trap for
the parents. I was only able to catch one of these and saw no sign
of the other. When we got home I again put the chick in an artificial
nest with its parent, but on this occasion she (or was it he &amp;apos;?) did not
do her duty. We left the youngster in the cage but occasionally fed
it by hand in the hope that the Redbreast would change her mind,
but after a couple of days the Blue Bird was found lying on its back
outside the nest practically dead and was only restored by means
of warmth and brandy : it was now twelve or thirteen days old and
very obstinate, and I had to open its bill and cram it with food until
it learned better manners and began to gape. After this all went well,

and everyone who passed the box in which it was kept was instructed
to give it a wee morsel occasionally. This young bird soon began to
thrive, and before long was pecking at live mealworms when it suddenly
died, I believe from an overdose of gentles which I had given it.
The Redbreast had meanwhile been returned to her own home,
and I suspect that separation from her mate may have made her refuse
to feed the chick when I caged her up. To return to No. 1 pair, on
20th June they had again begun to lay, and it will be seen that there was
always an interval of about a week between the removal of their
eggs and the production of another clutch.
On this fourth and last occasion only four eggs were laid, and I
decided to let them rear their own young if they could ; only three
young were hatched of which I found one dead at the age of eight days.
It was in the corner of the box and had been pushed out of the nest
itself. Next day I found another chick in the same position, but he
was not dead, so I took both young birds and attempted to hand-
rear them. To cut a very long story short one died and the other has
turned out a very nice hen and is extremely tame, an attribute which
I find rare in this species.
The story of No. 2 pair makes more interesting reading, and is
really my reason for publishing these notes.
The aviary which they occupied was only a small affair 10 feet by
6 feet with no shelter beyond a small roof at one end. My original
idea was to give these birds their liberty when they had young in the
hope that they would collect live food in my garden and supplement
their dietary of mealworms, ants' eggs, cockroaches and occasional
gentles.
By 8th May the hen was sitting on four eggs, having dropped the
fifth in the flight. The eggs began to hatch on the 22nd, on which
day I opened the feeding door and let the male out while the female
was on her eggs. He showed great excitement and immediately
proceeded to fight a cock Shama and the other Blue Robins through
the aviary wires. This was a bad beginning and I at last persuaded
him to go home with a few mealworms which he carried to the hen in
her box. By the following morning two more chicks had hatched,
but all were dead.

Dr. M. Amsle?--Blue Robins
On 29th May another clutch was started, five eggs being laid, and
during the incubation I gave both birds complete liberty by day,
closing the door in the late afternoon when both had returned to feed.
By this means I gradually accustomed them to a state of semi-liberty
and they learned their way about the garden and .its surroundings.
Further, they gradually became accustomed to their neighbours,
and fighting at last ceased. On 14th June one chick hatched out,
and although both parents appeared to be out and about all the after-
noon the remaining four eggs hatched also and all went well for a time.
I at once noticed that the chicks grew much faster than they do
when the parents are confined in an aviary, but notwithstanding their
liberty the old birds always looked to me as their quartermaster and
would willingly have allowed me to do all the catering in the way of
insects. I made it a rule not to provide these except in the morning
and evening, when twenty or thirty mealworms were thrown on the
garden path. As time went on and the young grew I increased the
number of mealworms and also provided lunch at midday in the shape
of ants' eggs and cockroaches. The ants' eggs I sprinkled in the lawn :
by this means they were not all found at once and provided several
meals, as the old birds frequently returned later and found a few more.
When the young were eleven days old I noticed what I can only
describe as a sulky behaviour on the part of the parents. They did
not become rabid at the sight of mealworms. Although they each
collected ten or a dozen at a time they merely sat on the aviary roof
and looked bored ; on looking into the nest-box I found one dead
chick and removed it, thinking this might be the cause of the trouble.
For some reason I was unable to stay to watch whether feeding was-
resumed, but the following morning my man came to me with a very
sad face and the remaining four chicks cold and stiff.
I have never been able to understand this sudden change in the
old birds' behaviour, but T have not ceased to regret that I did not
at once take the young to hand-rear as soon as I noticed that all was
not well.
So far I have said nothing of the charm of seeing these lovely birds
flitting hither and thither in complete freedom. The male is always
a lovely bird, but to see him hovering in the sun or alighting on a

branch with the typical upward flap of the wings is a sight never to
be forgotten.
I became quite tired of people calling to # ' see the blue birds flying
loose ", and I was always obliged to produce a few mealworms to prove
that they were really feeding young. Perhaps the most wonderful
or most striking point in their behaviour was their unerring flight
through the small aviary feeding door from any point or any angle.
Once they had killed or broken up their prey they would swoop like
hawks through that tiny door and with a twist up again w&amp;apos;ould disappear
like a flash into the nest-box.
So far my experiment had been a failure, two nests of young--dead
at twelve hours and twelve days respectively--I had done my best
and fallen far short of success, but I had noticed that the old birds
and more especially the cock often inspected nest-boxes exactly similar
to their own which are hung in various parts of the garden, and decided
that the birds could do their worst and even fly right away if they
wished.
The aviary was left open day and night and they were given their
ordinary soft food and a very few mealworms daily ; there was no
sign of their straying far although they occasionally disappeared for
an hour or so, but within two days they had completed a nest in a box
hung on an outhouse some 40 yards from their own aviary. On 2nd
July the first egg was laid : this was six days after the death of the
chicks. Pour eggs were laid, all of which hatched on the 17th. This
time I hardened my heart, and determined that the parents should
be forced to w r ork for their young, and for the first ten days I gave very
little insect food. It was absolutely necessary that I should inspect
the young daily as I intended to hand-feed them on the first sign of
things going wrong, and each day I walked warily past the nest to see
whether the hen was off ; as a rule I was greeted by a squint from
a large brown eye at the back of the dark nest-hole, but if she was not
there I quickly looked round to see whether she was in sight and
hurriedly looked into the nest if I thought I was unobserved. That
I seldom succeeded proves what a constant eye birds keep on their
young.
Although I could nowhere see the birds, it almost always happened

that just as I was opening the box I would hear a whirr of wings and
a " clip, clip " of a bill as one or other of the parents--usually the hen---
swooped within inches of my head.
All this did not really disturb the Robins and this time things
progressed merrily. Many strange and doubtless wholesome insects were
carried to the young, and I occasionally dropped a leaf covered with
cabbage butterfly caterpillars and I am sure these must be good, though
I was sufficiently unselfish not to sample them myself.
At ten days all was going swimmingly, and as I had rigidly adhered
to my decision not to spoil the parents by too much help I had great
hopes that I could now supplement the supply of wild insects with the
usual menu of ants' eggs, cockroaches, gentles and mealworms. These
were of course accepted, and on the thirteenth day fearing that the
young might leave the nest prematurely, I put the nest-box in a large
wire cage together with the two parents who were easily caught in
their own aviary. From now onwards I had to supply an ever-
increasing amount of insects, and on 2nd and 3rd August four strong,
well-feathered chicks left the nest; they were about seventeen days
old. They never looked back and within a week were feeding
themselves.
I find that ants' eggs together with a few live ants are a great
help in encouraging young birds to feed themselves.
They see the ant carrying an egg, make repeated dabs at it, and
finally get either the ant or the egg, or both.
The next step is a mealworm, and when they have mastered this
it is not difficult to get them on to soft food by adding a few broken
mealworms and ants' eggs when mixing the food.
This, then, is the end of an account of what has been to me a very
pleasant summer. The spring was ushered in by very obvious blanks
in the garden. Whole bushes and many plants had left me for ever
after a winter whose severity we shall not quickly forget, but nature
had obviously decided to make it up to us lovers of the open, and as
the days lengthened there came a profusion of growth and bloom the
like of which I cannot believe has been given to us for many a long
year. Now the winter is returning I shall often look back on the past
months not as a triumph of aviculture but as a very happy time when

the joy of my garden was greatly enhanced by the presence at every
turn of the Blue Birds whose doings I have so haltingly described.
We all look forward to the spring, perhaps no one more so than
aviculturists and gardeners, and I am already scheming for an early
start with at least one pair of Blue Kobins at liberty.
Eggs laid 32, young hatched 26--fully reared 6, not much of a
record--let us hope for better results in 1930.
At the time of writing, mid-October, all the young are in practically
adult plumage. The change from nestling plumage takes place without
any moult, but merely by change of colour or possibly by abrasion.

These homely looking birds resemble much more the Grosbeaks
than they do the Weaver. Nevertheless they are true Weavers and,
in spite of their Parrot-like bills, weave a very good nest when suitable
materials are at hand. I secured my first pair late in 1926, and previous
to that time had never met with them at any of the dealers although
I had been visiting their stores more or less regularly for over twenty
years. The cock of this pair did not live long, but the hen wintered out
during the severe winters of 1927 and 1928, so that we can assume
them to be fairly hardy birds. Early this year I was able to get a male
from a private importation from East Africa, and later on in the year
I got four young birds from Gamages. The East African cock mated
up with my old hen about the end of June, and he soon built her a nest
in a clump of bullrushes about 4 feet above the water. The nest in
shape closely resembled that of the common Bed-billed Weaver
(Quelea quelea), but was of course much bigger. It was attached to
two or three of the stouter rushes and was about 8 inches in depth,
the entrance hole being on the top side. The hen laid three eggs,
white with reddish brown spots, but as far as I could see she took no
part in the nest-building. The eggs proved to be infertile, and were
removed. Later in July another clutch of eggs was laid in the same
nest, but these also proved to be useless. As compared with the nests-

of the Hyphanbornine and Baya. Weavers the nests these birds built
were not so closely woven, and would not stand up so well against the
weather, showing a tendency to collapse after rain. This is quite
understandable when you consider the birds' beaks, which are shaped
much more like those of Parrots than Weavers. How they can weave
at all is a mystery to me. These beaks, by the way, can inflict a
very nasty bite. In colour the males are a dark chestnut brown,
and the females a lighter brown with a speckled breast. Both sexes
have a white wing bar, very conspicuous in flight. The young before
their first moult are like the females.

By D. Seth-Smith
The Sandgrouse (Pteroclidse), form a very distinct family of game-
birds, showing certain affinities to the Pigeons. They are purely
terrestrial, possessing very short legs and long pointed wings, and
inhabiting desert countries where they feed upon the seeds of various
grasses and other plants. Their plumage is mostly of a sandy or buff
colour, harmonizing with the surroundings in which they occur. The
tarsi and, in some cases, the toes also, are feathered. They are mostly
migratory and their flight is extremely rapid and powerful. They
nest on the ground, the nest consisting as a rule of a mere scrape in
the sand, and the eggs, three to a clutch, are smooth and glossy, rounded
at both ends, with brownish surface spots overlying pale purplish
markings beneath the surface of the shell. Both sexes undertake the
duties of incubation, the female sitting by day and the male at night,
and the young, which are covered with down and beautifully marked,
are reared on small seeds.
In captivity Sandgrouse thrive best in a dry situation ; a partially
covered, well-sheltered aviary with the roof mostly of glass, and a dry
sanded or earth floor ; an outer lawn of close-cut grass, and a gravel
path suiting them well. They should be fed upon canary and millet
and other small seeds and green food, and some species at least are
particularly fond of Shepherd's Purse, chickweed, dandelion and
watercress. Both the Greater and the Lesser Pintailed Sandgrouse
have been bred in captivity by Messrs. Meade-Waldo and St. Quintin,

the former having been the first to observe and describe the remarkable
method by which the males of certain, at least, and probably all
species, convey water to their young, namely by saturating the plumage
of their breasts and under parts in water and then flying to the nest,
where the young at once proceed to suck the moisture from these
feathers.
Sandgrouse are not often imported, but several species have been
kept in aviaries and, where the conditions are suitable, they thrive.
Pallas's Sandgrouse (Syrrhaptes paradoxus ), is one of two species
distinguished by the absence of a hind toe. It occurs in Central Asia
and is subject, for some unknown reason, to occasional migrations to
Western Europe such as occurred in 1863 and again in 1888, when
great numbers spread over Europe and reached the western coasts of
the British Isles.
The plumage of the male is sandy with rusty-red throat, a white
band flecked with black across the breast, and a large black patch
on the abdomen. The female has the sides of the neck spotted with
black, a black line below the reddish-buff throat, and no band across
the breast.
S. tibetanus differs in having the abdomen white with no black
patch.
The Eastern Greater Pintailed Sandgrouse ( Pteroclurus
alchatus), has, in the male, the lower breast and abdomen pure white
and white bars on the wing-coverts. The throat is black in summer
and white in winter. Chest, light rufous; upper parts, olive with
a yellowish tinge on each feather. In winter the whole plumage is
much duller.
The female has the chest of a much paler rufous than that of the
male.
This species occurs in South-Western Asia from Palestine to North-
West India and extending southwards to the Persian Gulf.
The Western Greater Pintailed Sandgrouse (P. a.
pyrenaicus), is a darker and more richly coloured form of P. alchatus ,
occurring in Southern Europe and North Africa. An account of the
breeding of this fine Sandgrouse, with a coloured plate of the adult
male and young chick appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for
May, 1906.

The Common or Lesser Pintailed Sandgrouse (P. exustus),
has a very wide range, occurring from West Africa through North and
East Africa and South-West Asia to India. It is considerably
smaller than the last, and the male has a narrow white and black
band across the chest and the lower breast and abdomen deep chestnut
brown, while the female has the chest and upper breast buff, spotted
with black and the abdomen blackish-brown, barred with rufous-buff.
This species has been successfully bred in captivity by Mr. W. H.
St. Quintin, who published an account of the event in the Avicultural
Magazine of December, 1904.
The Spotted Pintailed Sandgrouse (P. senegallus), occurs
from the Southern Sahara through South-West Asia to North-West
India. The male has the chest and upper breast pale fawn-colour,
and the middle of the abdomen black. The female has the upper
parts of the body and the chest marked with blackish spots.
The Black-bellied Sandgrouse (Pterocles arenarius). This is
one of the short-tailed Sandgrouse and is found in North Africa,
Southern Europe, and Central Asia. It is one of the largest species,
and the male may be distinguished by its black abdomen, the throat
being chestnut followed by a black band, the back being pale rufous
and grey, the feathers having buff-coloured tips. The female has the
throat yellowish-white followed by a black band, the chest being
pale buff spotted with black, the back barred with black.
The Indian Painted Sandgrouse (P. fasciatus), is found only
in India, and is distinguished by the presence, in the male, of a pectoral
band of three colours, chestnut, buff and black, and the wing-coverts
with white and grey bars to the extremity of each feather. The
female lacks the pectoral band.
The African Painted Sandgrouse (P. quadricinctus), closely
resembles P. fasciatus , but may be distinguished by the wing-coverts
of the male being barred with black.
The Coronated Sandgrouse (P. coronatus), occurs in North-
Eastern Africa and South-Western Asia and has been rarely imported.
The male has the throat yellow, divided for about half its length by
a black bar, surrounding the gape. A white patch on the forehead.
The female lacks the black bar on the throat.

I was very fascinated by the article in the Avjcultural Magazine
of November, 1928, by the Marquess of Tavistock, giving his interesting
account of Foreign Birds at Liberty.
Although at the time I was quite a novice at aviculture, I felt I
must try and make a similar experiment.
On the 21st May, I purchased twelve newly imported Orange
Bishops and constructed a portable cage, 6 ft. by 3 ft. by 6 ft. In this
I fixed an old case, about 2 ft. 6 in. square, for the birds to shelter in.
They were kept in this cage for ten days, and as I had started this
experiment rather late, I was afraid that the birds would not have time
to settle down and nest when liberated. On the tenth day I opened
the front of the cage, naturally expecting the birds to fly away, but to
my surprise that same night I found that not one had disappeared.
The next day I was passing at the back of the cage with, a friend,
not thinking about the birds at the time, when two flew out, evidently
frightened. I thought it advisable to shut the remaining birds in
and to open the cage again on the following day when no visitors
were near. To my surprise the next morning I found the two birds
which had been liberated sitting on the top of the cage evidently anxious
to get in again. I felt certain then that the two at liberty would help to
keep the rest of the birds near at hand. The next day all the birds had
left, and I think that every day since then, without exception, some of
the birds were to be seen flying about the garden, from one spinney
to another, just like little balls of fire.
After some weeks it was possible for strangers even to approach
within 2 ft. of the birds, and it was a simple matter to discover them,
as they invariably perched on the topmost branch of any clump of
bushes which attracted them.
A number of nests were made within a very short distance of the
house, and certainly voung were reared, though I am unable to say
how many.
When I started this experiment, I was told that I should be more
likely to have success if there were a pond with reeds, etc., near at hand.

Unfortunately I have not got one, but I did not find this any
disadvantage. For a few weeks I used to hang millet seed in various
parts of the garden, and also trays with millet and canary seed, but
I could see that all this was not necessary, as all the birds came back
regularly to their old home. The wild birds were very interested
when the Weavers came to feed, but I found that the Weavers could
hold their own easily with Sparrows and other birds.
I found this one of the most fascinating parts of aviculture, and
since I am such a novice and have yet met with so much success, I
cannot understand why similar experiments are not more generally
attempted. 1 have persuaded several friends to try next year, and all
being well I hope to liberate considerably more birds myself.
Those who are not familiar with the cost may be interested to know
that the dozen Weavers cost me 14s. only, and the cage itself need
not be elaborate, so that the initial cost is very small. I have already
caught up the same number of birds that I liberated, and there are
still others which occasionally appear.
MR. GOODFELLOW'S COLLECTION
Mr. Walter Goodfellow arrived home on 9th November from a
collecting trip in the East with a collection of about a hundred birds,
many of which are new to aviculture, while others are of great rarity.
There are six specimens of the remarkable Bald Starling, Sarcops calvus
--from New Guinea, a wonderful Lory, Chalcopsittacus duyvenbodei
from the same country, three Black-headed Pittas, Pitta sordida , and
one Purple Pitta, P. granatina, from Borneo ; eight Green Broadbills,
Calyptomena viridis, and one Hose's Broadbill, C. hosei. There are
three Spider-hunters, Arachnothera modesta from Sarawak, of a dull
greenish above with grey breasts. There is one pair of the splendid
Bulwer's Pheasant, Lobiophasis bulweri, six Gray's Argus, Argusianus
grayi, and three species of Firebacks.
A most striking bird is the large Pheasant Cuckoo, Carpococcyx
radiatus, from Borneo, greenish above, grey below, with a purple
tail and black head.

The splendid results obtained by Messrs. Boosey and Brooksbank
as recorded in this issue show what can be done in breeding foreign
birds in this country. If only more people would pursue the fascinating
hobby of Aviculture on the lines adopted by Messrs. Boosey and
Brooksbank there should be no fear of such birds as Gouldians and many
others dying out without re-importation.
Mr. Whitley has at the present time in the aviaries of the Primley
Zoological Gardens no less than 137 species of Parrots and 10 different
Parrot hybrids, surely the most wonderful collection that has ever
been got together. There are 12 species of Macaws, 14 of Cockatoos,
19 of Conures, and 19 of Amazon Parrots.
Mrs. Drake sends me from Falmouth a sample of millet spray that
was grown by accident on a rubbish heap, and it reminds me of the
possibility of growing this and other foods for birds in this country.
Both millet and canary seed can be grown quite well in this country
providing the summer is a moderately good one, and the seeds given
when barely ripe in the ear not only afford great pleasure to all seed-
eating birds but provide them with natural and very valuable food.
It is well worth while to sow a few patches of such seeds.

Mrs. Drake asks if someone will invent a dye to obviate the
necessity of using rings for marking Budgerigars. In two cases her
birds have been caught in the wire-netting by their rings and
only been rescued jnst in time. I wonder if others have experienced
the same trouble.
In a collection recently received by Messrs. Chapmans from
Venezuela were at least three species that are probably new to Avicul-
ture, namely, the Blue-naped Conure, Pyrrhura emma, the Olive
and Blue Tanager, Tanagra olivicyanea, and the Black and Green
Tanager, Calliste nigrivirides.

Sir, --My Peters' Firefinches failed me again, and one morning
in September I found the male bird dead. The Diamond Doves,
Zebra-finches, Bengalese and Golden-breasted Waxbills have bred
splendidly, and as for Budgerigars over seventy have been reared from
four pairs and still they go on, although I take the eggs away now.
A year ago I procured three Giant Whydahs, but they have all turned
out to be males; very charming and peaceful birds, but where do the
hens go to ? My Spreos are all males unfortunately.

to take away the eggs. --Ed.]

Sir, --Seeing in a recent issue of the Avicultural Magazine
Lord Tavistock speaks of the difficulty of sexing Silverbills, it might
be of interest to some members to know what an old dealer once told
me of the difference in plumage. The cock's flight feathers are edged
with black, while the hen's are brown, very slight it is true, but I have
always managed to pick out a pair by this.
(Miss) D. E. Pithie.
THE ORIGINAL COLOUR OF THE BUDGERIGAR
Sir, --In your note to my letter in the November Magazine, you
appear to be confusing two very different things : Albinism and
Evolution. Albinos may appear under exactly the same conditions
as the normal; Evolution is caused by environment. The man who
helped some of us in our early days, the late Dr. Greene, did not believe
in evolution, if he had been living now he might have changed his views.
I suppose everyone to-day believes that the " Platvcercus " are
all descended from a common ancestor, and the changes have been
caused by environment and have little or nothing to do with Albinism.
It is generally acknowledged that the lion was once a spotted
animal, but as far as I know it has never been actually proved.
I grant that green is a commoner colour than blue in Parrots to-day ;
still; as yellow sometimes appears (the blue pigment being left out) it is
possible that in time the blue may be entirely eliminated, then most
Parrots will be yellow. You ask me if I suggest " a white Blackbird
represents the original type of its species ". I say decidedly NO.
A muddy brown and a dirty slate appear to be Nature's original
colours. I should say it would be brown, more like the female.

with black, much as in the splendid hybrid on the south side near
the Bird House. There is, however, no trace of Burmese blood in the
head-points or neck colour of the present specimen, and I conclude
that it is a semi-mutant and a pure-bred bird ; but I should like to
know its pedigree. A three-quarter Common quarter Burmese the
Zoo had did not show more black on the wing than a common Peacock,
but had the pencilling on the wing finer and the neck greener. In all
cases of crossing between ordinary Common Peafowl and Blackwings
I have seen or read of the offspring were definitely one or the other type.
F. Finn.
HYBRID GUINEA-FOWL AND SOME OTHER HYBRIDS
Sir, --It would be very interesting if Mr. Laidlay would give us
the characteristics of his hen Guinea-fowl bred from Mitre X Vulturine
crossed with Mitre X Domestic, because this cross repeats Darwin's
classical one with Pigeons, Black Barb X White Fantail crossed with
Black Barb X Red Spot--with the important difference that Mr.
Laidlay's bird is bred from distinct species, not man-made breeds.
Darwin, as is well known, got a Blue-Rock-coloured bird from the above,
and thus was able to prove reversion to the Rock Dove, which for other
reasons he regarded as the ancestor of tame pigeons.
In fowls he got a bird nearly like the Jungle-fowl from a cross
between Black Spanish and White Silky, thus obtaining reversion at
once with a single cross.
There are several cases known in which a hybrid has turned out
much more like a third species than either of the two concerned in
its production, and in some of these the third species is probably older
in type than the other two.
The cases I know of are : Common Sheldrake X African Grey-
headed Ruddy Sheldrake ; hybrids bred at the Zoo many years ago
were more like Australian Sheldrake. These were till lately on
view at South Kensington : Common Wigeon X Chilian Wigeon, bred
by Mr. Shore Baily ; hybrid very like American Wigeon (Bird Notes,
Ser. 3, vol. iii, 1920, p. 12. Mikado Pheasant X Elliot's Pheasant,
shown at Zoo during this century ; hybrid very like Hume's Pheasant.

Kaleeges X Silver Pheasant, recorded by Huet, Bull. Soc . Accumulation,
vol. xxxvi, 1889 ; hybrid resembled Lineated Kaleege.
Not long ago the Zoo was exhibiting a Rhea bred between Darwin's
and the Common species ; this showed traces of the black breast-mark
of the latter and the white spots of the former, but so slightly that at
a little distance it looked like a uniform drab bird ; its general colour
being like that of the young of both. I judge that the young Darwin's
is drab like the young Common by having seen patches of this colour
among the new dark white-spotted plumage of some young birds.
Presumably the ancestral Rhea had a uniform drab coloration.
In all the above cases reversion to an ancestral type seems to be
indicated, but in a case when in the nineties a black-and-white Domestic
Pigeon bred with an African Half-collared Dove (Turtur semitorquatus)
in an aviary at St. James's Park the hybrid offspring were uncommonly
like Stock Doves, being blue without any noticeable marking except
that the end of the tail was noticeably lighter, as in the Dove parent.
Here there was reversion to the wild colour of one parent, though not
complete, as the black wing-bars of the Blue-rock were absent, and
the resemblance to the allied Stock Dove with its nearly plain blue
wing was accidental. There are no blue Turtle Doves, and the young
plumage of this group is on the whole browner than the adult, while
both Rock and Stock Dove show a little brownish colouring in first
feather, so that the common ancestor of Turtle Doves and typical
Pigeons was in all probability a brown bird.
F. Finn.
A LONG-LIVED SUNBIRD
Sir, -- I have just lost a Greater Double-collared Sunbird from
South Africa, bought from Hamlyn in full colour in 1920. The bird
must have been at least ten years old, as their breeding season being
in our winter months, would mean he was hatched in 1919. He was
a little feeble the last year, but happy and contented to within an hour
of his death, when he just faded out in my hand, from old age. He
was always fed on the usual milk and honey mixture, out every day
for exercise, and in the summer spent many days in a garden aviary,
returning to his cage each evening.

HOODED SISKIN HYBRIDS

Sir, -- I kept two hens and the one cock out of the seven three-
quarter Canary one-quarter Hooded Siskin hybrids which were reared
in my aviary last year. The two hens made nests in bushes and boxes,
and sat in them, though they never laid any eggs. The cock paired up
to a hen Goldfinch, both birds built the nest in which the Goldfinch
laid, but the eggs were infertile, so I suppose these hybrids are incapable
of reproduction.

ANOTHER VARIETY OF BUDGERIGAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985407333333333" page_id="56216124"  page_num="332" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- The Budgerigar Club is very interested at the moment in
a new variety called " Grey wings " or " Silverwings. " As I have this
year bred five of these birds with a light-blue body tinge, and as I am,
I think, the first to breed them with a cobalt tinge (I have three of
these latter), I hope that you will allow me to write a few words
about them.
The officials of the B.C. have not yet fixed any description for
exhibition purposes, nor have they yet decided the name of this new
variety. They intend to do so at the next annual meeting at the Crystal
Palace in February, when it is hoped that a number will be exhibited
in the A.O.C. Class.
Perhaps the most likely name is " Grey wings " (the Germans call
them " Garufiugel "), for these birds differ from all other blue
Budgerigars, in that they have waves on the wings and feathers in the
tail of a distinctly grey colour. These grey markings are very clear,
and the colour factor is, I gather, the same for them as for those on the
" apple-green " ; indeed, a white Budgerigar compares with a " grey-
wing ", very much as a pure yellow compares with an apple-green.
The Swiss name was (and perhaps still is) " Azurblau This
name refers evidently to the delicate blue tinge, similar to that on a
white but deeper, over the body of the bird. It is not a good name,

for it would not include my cobalt-tinged birds, nor the mauve-tinged
birds which will no doubt be bred before long. Moreover, the striking
point about the birds is the grey wave marking, and not the colour of
the body, beautiful though it is.
Another pretty name is " Silverwings This is taken, I am told,
from the Japanese and refers, I suppose, to the silvery appearance
of the birds when on the flight. The name seems, however, to fail in
that it might equally apply to the so-called bad whites with strong
wing pencillings.
The birds might, then, be described shortly as " White Budgerigars
with strong mauve, cobalt, or blue suffusion, having very distinct
grey markings
I believe that there is a great future for these " grey wings I
have shown my three cobalt " grey wings " to several experienced
breeders, and also to people who know little about birds, and I think
that all agreed that they are the most lovely of all Budgerigars.

For those Aviculturists who prefer a food needing no preparation I can now
supply this well known food, a perfect diet for all insect and fruit-eating
birds, foreign finches, waxbills, etc., prepared ready for use with finest honey
and beef dripping. Yolk of egg if desired. If aviculturists knew the amount
of care taken in the preparation of my foods, they would be surprised, and
what a treat they are for the birds! I am asking those aviculturists who have
not yet given e Life ' a trial to send 3d. to cover postage, and I will send two
samples, one needing slight preparation the other ready to use, and once they
have seen how birds thrive on them I feel sure they will always use one or
other of my preparations.
