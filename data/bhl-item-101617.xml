COUNCIL'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1921
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986706333333333" page_id="32670548"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The year which ends with this number has been one of the most
difficult of the so-called " peace " years ; but the Society has come
through the ordeal, and rather than look back at the trials of the past
we should look forward to the future with confidence and hope, seeing
the signs that are visibly pointing to a real revival of aviculture. Several
large consignments of birds have come into this country in the course
of the year, and the importation of foreign species is the most important
factor in the support of the Society, for without birds to keep aviculture
alive we can neither get contributions to our Magazine nor hope to
secure new members. The difficulties of the present time have caused
many aviculturists to give up their hobby and resign their membership,
and unless these resignations can be made good, it will be impossible
to enlarge the Magazine so long as the cost of production remains a3
high as it is at present. It is to be hoped, therefore, that members will
do their best to induce their friends to join the Society and will send
the Editors accounts of the doings of their birds, so as to help to get
back to the days of a Magazine of thirty-two pages and a coloured plate.
Signed for the Council,

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young and
be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder. An
evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the breeder
from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will seriously prejudice
any other claims he or she may subsequently advance for the breeding of the same
or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [ name of

DIET FOR REARING YOUNG BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981606347826087" page_id="32670575"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
I see from notes by Mr. Seth-Sniitli in the November issue of the
Journal that 1920 has been a very poor breeding season. Although my
fellow-members have my sympathy, I must admit that the statement
brought me some measure of comfort and consolation.
The past season has been the worst in my experience since I first
took up foreign birds. A few Diamond Doves and four Swainson's
Lorikeets are all I can boast of after months of care and attention.
Orange-headed Ground Thrushes looked promising ; the male gave all
his titbits to the female even after the moult was completed in October,
but beyond the carrying of a few straws there was no attempt at
reproduction.
My present pair are both young and vigorous birds, and my failure
is all the more disappointing as in previous years I have seldom failed
to get at least two nests of young.
It may not be out of place here to advise those who may be
keeping these (or allied) species to separate the male from the female
when all breeding is over. My experience with more than one pair is
that the male is more attentive during the breeding season, but that
after the moult he chases the hen about, prevents her feeding, and by
generally bullying her either causes her death or finally kills her, unless
separated in time. When springtime comes round the hen will turn
the tables on the cock if he is introduced to her too early.

Maurice Arrester--Diet for Rearing Young Birds
As 1 proposed saying something about the feeding of birds in this
article, I may perhaps mention that these Thrushes and also the
American Robin (Tardus migratorius ) do not require a large quantity
of mealworms in rearing young. Two or three dozen should be given daily
for the first three days, after which the quantity may be gradually
reduced, their place being taken by small earthworms. The latter
are best supplied in a large shallow box containing plenty of damp moss.
The worms live indefinitely, and the parent birds have a continuous
food supply. Gentles I have already mentioned and advocated in the
Magazine. I have used millions in my time with no untoward result,
but they must be properly scoured, preferably in meal or flour, until
they have lost their central black line. Cockroaches or blackbeetles are,
I know, said to " scour " the young birds. My experience is that the
parents only use the smaller insects, and the results have always satisfied
me. Lastly there is raw meat; my last brood of Orange-headed Ground
Thrushes, reared in 191-1, were fed very largely on it, and left the nest
very fit and strong and were fully reared. &apos; I think a good deal depends
on its preparation. My method was to pass the meat through a mincer,
together with stale bread ; the mixture is then quite crumbly, and does
not seem to disgust the birds like a mass of pure meat. The parent
birds in question had been in my possession for some three years, and
it is possible that their long captivity had caused them to forget the
aversion, which we all know, to feeding with anything but live food.
The above points may appear a trifle laboured, but mealworms are
at the present costing Is. per ounce. Given liberally a pair of feeding
Thrushes could dispose of an ounce daily, and a good deal more when the
youngsters were half-grown. I tremble to think what my bill would
have been at the present price wdien I had young of Occipital Blue Pies
and Yucatan Jays ! The price of " soft food " at 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6 d. a
pound also "gives us to think". 1 have completely given up buying the
made-up article, and find that biscuit-meal (preferably grocer's biscuits)
mixed with a small quantity of minced cooked meat suits the larger
insectivorous birds perfectly well. To this may be added twice weekly
as a treat some well-crushed hard-boiled eggs. In addition to this all
my birds get a daily ration of the Lorikeets' food mentioned below,
and I think it is to this that their fitness is partly due.

I mentioned earlier that the Swainson's Lorikeets had reared four
young in 1920. Two eggs since, laid in August, were clear ; but there
are two more in the nest-box due to hatch in a day or two. So I may
yet beat my own record and rear six in the year. This would make a
total of sixteen young in three years -- a pretty good record, seeing that
the clutch is never more than two in number. For this I take no credit.
I merely happen to have bought a breeding pair, not an invariable
occurrence with this genus. When these Lorikeets first arrived I was
told to feed them on a mixture containing Mellin's food, condensed
milk, honey, and crumbled biscuit or sponge-cake made up with boiling
water ; some of the ingredients were not very easy to obtain during the
War, and all were expensive in the long run. However, I continued
their use until the birds had reared their first chick. This bird grew
very slowly, although the above food was supplemented with cane-
sugar, which Mr. E. J. Brooke told me was very important ; he left the
nest at the age of twenty weeks , and was of about the same size as other
young birds I have since reared, which left the nest at five weeks.
I could not help thinking that in the case of these birds (I am not
referring to Sun-birds, Sugar-birds, and such like delicate fry) there was
something lacking in the condensed milk which handicapped the growth
of the young. Whether I was right or wrong, I decided at the time to
try a simpler food. I had noticed that the old birds were fond of sweet
rice pudding, but as this takes hours to make properly I tried ground
rice boiled for a few minutes with fresh cow's milk and sweetened with
honey-sugar. This has been my staple food ever since, some two and a
half years, and the birds get scarcely anything else, very occasionally
a little fruit or perhaps a little custard. But they do not care much
for these " treats
We have heard and read a good deal about " Vitamines " of late,
and I am wondering whether the usual mixture given to Sun-birds,
etc., may not be lacking in some such substance. It is known that the
lack of a Vitamine affects young and growing animals and birds much
more than it does adults, and the use of fresh cow's milk might make all
the difference in the rearing of some rarity, such as a Sun-bird or
Fruitsucker.
I know, of course, that both these and other genera feed their young

E. Maud Knobel--Seeding Parrots
largely with insects, but in the case of the Gold-fronted Fruitsucker,
which I nearly bred on three different occasions, the old birds used
both the condensed milk mixture and also pure honey, in addition to
insects, in feeding the young, which never lived beyond twelve days.
Perhaps my ground rice and milk might have brought me success.
All the above is, of course, merely theory, but in the feeding of all
except the hardiest birds we must remember that the diet is largely
artificial, and when failure occurs we must bear in mind what are called
for want of deeper knowledge " accessory food bodies ". An intensely
interesting article appeared in L'Oiseau some months ago. The writer
dealt in a very convincing manner with the lack of Vitamines as the
cause of death in many of the more delicate African Finches. Perhaps
Mr. Delacour would allow a verbatim translation of the article for the
Avieultural Magazine. To refer again to the ground rice mixture, it is
this which I mentioned earlier in these notes as being used to supple-
ment the insectivorous birds' food. All the birds get a small quantity
daily. Amongst those which I know eat freely of it I mav mention
Waxbills, King Parrakeets, Jays, Thrushes, Tits, Whydahs, and even,
occasionally, the Diamond Doves.
I am sure the birds thrive on it, it is a welcome change for them, and
as it contains milk it may be taken as a sort of substitute for insect food;
this in the case of the smaller Waxbills, who seldom eat mealworms,
is an important point during the winter months when gnats, green-fly,
and such like small fry do not exist.
Having opened the subject of food and diet, might I ask other
members for their views thereon. A number of useful and interesting
facts on feeding might be brought to light by a series of articles on this
topic.

By E. Maud Ivxobel

forward for distinguishing them. It is said that a practised eye can

hitherto employed are by carefully noting any differences that may
occur. Even then it is very difficult if you have an old hen and a
young cock. say. for example, of a Blue-fronted Amazon, and one can
never be quite sure. May I venture to put forward another suggestion
for determining the sexes ? In doing so I should like it to be borne in
mind that I am speaking of parrots only, for it is solely in this family
of birds that my experience lies. This is by carefully feeling the bird
in the neighbourhood of the pelvis. In the cock bird you will find the
pelvic bones taper down to a point and lie so close together that they
are practically touching, whereas in a hen bird the pelvic bones are
wide enough apart to allow an egg to pass through.
In my Alexandrine Parrot, which I know is a cock bird by the
black and rose collar, the pelvic bones lie close together, and I find the
same in my small Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, which has black eyes, and
whose general demeanour pronounces him a cock bird. Out of the eight
Blue-fronted and two Yellow-fronted Amazons I have kept I believe
only two were male birds, and I am inclined to think that the majority
of birds that come over to this country are females. Mr. C. P. Arthur,
in his account of Grey Parrots in his book Parrots for Pleasure and
Profit , says much the same thing, i.e. that he has not found a single
male among the many he has dissected.
Last year I had a charming Yellow-fronted Amazon (Judy), which
I subsequently determined to be a hen. I must say the first time I saw
her in a shop I was not greatly taken with her, but the next day I
visited her again, when she promptly stepped off her perch on to my
hand. I at once bought her and carried her home. The very first
morning I let her out she flew^ across the room on to my shoulder,
and never have I had a bird which formed so great an attachment as
she did. She was really never happy unless she w r as on me, and she was
the most gentle and playful little creature I have ever had. Yet she
was undoubtedly a hen, and this entirely does away w T ith the theory
that male birds like women and females men. In her case, from out-ward,
examination, the pelvic bones were quite an inch apart, and dissection
after death, which came all too soon, proved her unquestionably to be
a hen. I missed her so much and was so unhappy at her loss that two
days after I replaced her--if one can say such a thing, for one never

Prebendary Lambrick -- The Story of a Tame Book
replaces, really -- with a baby Blue-fronted Amazon, a funny little thing
with no wing or tail feathers, in fact very few feathers at all, but mostly
brown clown. In this bird the pelvic bones lie close together, touching
each other, and I have no hesitation in pronouncing him a cock. I
tamed him in two days, that is to say, he would come on my hand,
lie on his back on my lap, and let me kiss and stroke him, but he will
never adore me in the way Judy did, and has a very independent
nature, but he has moulted into a handsome bird and promises to be
an excellent talker and whistler.
My little Senegal Parrot, who in point of size and colouring is quite
as beautiful as the one so many of us know and admire in the Parrot-,
house at the Zoo, with the exception that in mine the head is a trifle
smaller, has the pelvic bones about # in. apart, and I feel quite sure
in my own mind that she is a hen. In the very few dead specimens that
I have been able to examine I have nor found that the pelvic bones of
either sex look very different, and I am inclined to think that what
one feels in a live cock bird is not so much bone matter as cartilage or
gristly matter, extending on beyond the pelvic bones down to a fine
point, and which in a dead bird gets quickly shrivelled up so that one
cannot find it.
There may not be much in this theory, but certain it is that in some
birds the bones are wide apart, in others close together, and one
naturally asks oneself if this does not denote sex. Why, then, should it
be ? Perhaps some other members who have had more experience and
opportunity of studying these things will be able to help in determining
this question.

described as robbing each other's nests of sticks is, in fact, a splendid
system of fagging ? It is, at any rate, noteworthy in our case that
it is always the " road " birds that commandeer the " house " birds'
sticks. The cocks seem to take it as a matter of course, but sometimes
the little ladies resist the demand on their youthful spouses. The heads
of the clan seem to control the number of nests that are built, and it is
not an uncommon sight to see them pull nests to pieces and drive birds
away. The sentries are well posted, but never disturb the birds for
any of our household passing up and down the avenue at night, but if
a stranger comes the conversation is very general, and not always polite.
We know immediately the whortleberries are in on the hills by the
droppings under the trees. Last year in the autumn the great
parliament was held in a big field alongside their houses. Two or three
thousand birds came, arriving about ten o'clock in the morning and
settling in long lines across the field. From time to time companies
rose out of the line, circled in the air, and alighted in another line,
for all the world like going to attend another committee. On one
occasion a great sorrow befel us. Two crows came and settled among the
rooks, and although sitting, the whole colony rose into the air one Sunday
afternoon, divided into three bodies, and deserted the nests. One section
went off to the Mendip Hills, and we were able to observe the interesting
fact that they built in separate isolated trees, covering a fairly large
area, and not congregating together as usual, and began again to lay,
and brought up their young families. So much for the wisdom of the
agricultural committee of a county council who suggested beating
drums, lighting fires, collecting noisy boys to drive sitting birds off
their nests, and so put down the pest! They may be wise, but they have
not " cornered " Rookie yet!
But now I must come to the great day. On the 1st of May, 1912,
I was going up the avenue when I heard a most fearful cawing, and on
the ground there were two tiny fledglings, perfectly bare except for
their wing-quills. One was injured and died, the other, the screecher,
I took up in my hands and brought into the house. The next day I
went to Ireland, and when I came back after a month Rookie had taken
over the rectory, which she has ruled ever since. My housekeeper,
Miss Latcham, was the foster-mother, and the bird always goes to her

with her ailments now, and she also much prefers to be put to bed by
her nannie.
She is absolutely free of the house, never has her wing cut, and asks
for all she wants, and we can always tell whether it is her bath, food,
bed, or change, of air that she requires.
She has a far more acute sense of hearing than we have, and can
detect the noise of an aeroplane or motor-car many seconds before
we do. She is, moreover, always certain of the direction from which it
is coming, whereas we are often confused. She is very accurate in
distinguishing sound, and always knows whether I ring the bell for
daily service or my colleague. If he rings she takes no further notice ;
if I do she lights on the window and waits anxiously for me to come down
the garden.
When we were billeting troops during the War, she took great delight
in the horses and men, and much appreciated the officers of the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers because of their fleches, which her keen eye had detected
before they entered the house, and which she had a continuous desire
to remove all the time they were with us.
She builds her nest every year in the workroom. Her first was
constructed entirely of what could be got in the house. She started
with twigs out of the housemaid's box, then impounded four work-
scissors, my 2 ft. rule, three silver teaspoons, the receipt file, reels
of cotton and silk, two tape measures, a strap, string, and tape.
All these were wonderfully worked in, the interlacing being most clever
and laborious. Having satisfied herself with the outside, she proceeded
to line the nest, the first precious prize being a new' chamois leather ;
this was followed by three cleaning-cloths, a pair of stockings, pieces
of linen, flannel, silk, a newspaper torn to shreds and taken piece by
piece. Bright colour w^as a great attraction, and always preferred to
white or brown goods. Each year since then we have put a box with
sticks and remnants in the room for her. She has always liked me to
help, and this year she was more than ever exacting, her scheme being
that I should bring the material and she build the nest, which she put
together in a very cosy corner of the wardrobe. I am expected to feed
her when she is nesting.
Her memory is most remarkable, The Rev, E. F, Turner left

Blagdon in 1914 and came back in 1919 for the first time after being
demobilized. I was sitting with the bird when she suddenly began to
fly about madly, and we heard a footstep outside. She could not have
seen him, but remembered his step, and there was no rest till she was
allowed to welcome her old friend and show him he was not forgotten.
In the old days it was great fun to see the little rook and the tall big
man walking demurely up the avenue together.
She shows great accuracy in measurements. At one time she was
very fond of taking pins out of the packet, would hold as many as
fifteen in her beak, and then plant them in twos and threes under
different objects. If we moved them or changed them when she was
out of the room she never failed to detect there were three where she
had put two, or to note any other alteration that had been made, and
was never satisfied till she had replaced them all in their original
positions.
I feel I must tell one story against myself. I was doing some
sermon work one morning, and had put down a note on a small scrap
of paper, when suddenly " Jinnie " went off with it. When I went
for her she calmly swallowed it. In righteous indignation I caught her
and smacked her on the claws with a pencil. She then skipped on to
the inkstand and, to my horror, proceeded to drink ink in a most
suicidal manner. When she had swallowed as much as she could hold
I found that death was not her object, but vengeance, for she spat
the whole of it over my face and collar ! It took my wife some time
to recover from the effect of uncontrollable fits of laughter at my
appearance.
She has established an ascendancy over our kitchen cat, and it was
great fun the other day to see poor pussy a prisoner under the copper
and Rookie, like a sentry, marching up and down in front keeping her
in, at the end of her beat always going about facing her charge in
correct style.
She appreciates getting a letter through the post. She cleverly
opens the envelope with her beak, draws out &apos;the enclosure and stands
on it, and soon lets everyone know that that piece of paper is her own
especial possession, and must not be touched. As with the letter just
described, so is her dealing with a bit of dough or a piece of bacon-

rind thrown down to her. She waits for the cook, after placing her
pastry in the oven or her bacon in the frying-pan, to present her with
scraps for similar treatment. Her imitation of two cats fighting is
so realistic that the girls have rushed into the kitchen thinking a strange
cat had caught her, only to find her on the gas-bracket giving a musical
sketch.
If you go out without saying anything she flies madly about the
room. If you say to her, " Coming back soon," she quite understands
and remains peaceful and satisfied.
She is very fond of putting things in the tuck of my trousers. One
day in church I heard faintly the sound of a silver bell during service,
and it turned out to be a thimble her ladyship had stolen and put in
her usual store-cupboard, which had shaken out on to the marble floor
of the chancel. We hardly ever lose anything by her thefts, as all she
steals she endows me with.
One of her greatest friends is Mr. Gilbert Day, our plumber. He
always ignores her sex and calls her " Jack". There is a wonderful
freemasonry between them. He gives her most fascinating things out
of his bag, but if he happens to want the particular thing he simply
says " Come on, Jack ", and the bird comes straight up, gives over
what she has got, and receives a substitute from him. The way she
pokes her beak into all his work and down the pipes is a perfect lesson
to a clerk of the works. One word as to her digestion. She has survived
two tabloids of pyrogallic acid and half a dozen Beecham's pills ! But
a saccharine tabloid does not appeal to her at all.
No words can describe the bird's devoted affection. If I am out for
a few minutes, there is a joyous welcome back; if I return after a few
weeks' absence, such a greeting ! So much to tell me ! She knows the
true meaning of love, for it is always " giving " with her, not " getting
She brings her first bit of food for me to share, and is only too delighted
if I ransack her little treasury, which no one else may even look at.
She is happy for hours on my shoulder, greets me the first thing in the
morning, is so disappointed if I cannot give her an hour before the rest
are up, and has a last word for me before I go to bed; and I can close
this letter as I did a letter to the Spectator three years ago : " As I
write she is on my wrist, talking to me all the time."

MY PATAGONIAN PARROTS

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998830333333333" page_id="32670585"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
One day last autumn I was wandering through one of the large
West End bird stores, when my attention was called to a cage full of
Parrots. On asking the attendant what they were called he said
Patagonian Conures, and that they had only lately been landed, together
with some Blue-crowned Conures. Amongst the five birds in the cage
were two birds considerably larger than the others and of a lighter
colour. It is true that one of these birds had very few feathers on it at
all, and the other was in bad condition, but in view of their possible
rarity I decided to take the lot. On getting them home and examining
the two large ones carefully, I made them out to be C. bryoni , although
they differed in one or two important points from the description of
this bird, especially in the absence of the white band across the chest,
as described in both Seth-Smith's and Butler's books. The smaller
birds were also without this white band, although in all other respects
they answered to the description given in the books. The question is,
does this white band exist in either species ? It is not shown in
the capital drawing in Mr. Seth-Smith's book, nor can I see any
trace of it in the print in Dr. Butler's work. I wrote to the
Magazine on this subject a short time since, and it was suggested
by both Lord Tavistock and Mr. Seth-Smith that the larger
birds were hybrids. At that time I could think of no possible
cross except between "C. patagonus " and "C. hcsmorrhous ", but
the difficulty in my mind was the large size of my Parrots.
Dr. Graham Renshaw thought that the size of my birds did not affect
the question, mentioning the fact that the hybrid is often larger than
either of its parents ; but my experience with hybrids in birds does not
bear this out, as although I have bred many hybrids I have never had
one yet that was larger than the bigger of its parents. I have now come
to the conclusion that the smaller birds are pure "C. palagonus ", and the
other two the offspring of a cross between the Little Macaw, "Am severa ,"
and the Blue-crowned Conure, "C. lioemorrlious Their description is
as follows : general body colour above and below, light grass-green ;
primaries, bluish-green ; a small patch on wing butts, and a garter

W. Shore-Baily--My Patagonian Parrots
scarlet; under side of tail-feathers, red ; a narrowband across forehead,
dark chestnut brown ; front of head, light brown ; upper mandible,
white, with tip black ; lower mandible, black ; patch of bare skin
around the eye white ; size about equal to the Alexandrine Parrakeet.
It will be noticed that the forehead, wing-butts, and tail correspond
very closely in colour with the same parts in "A.severa ", and the rest of
the body with that of "C. hoemorrlious ". I have always considered this
latter bird to be closely allied to the smaller Macaws, especially in regard
to the size of its bill. This bill, by the way, is a most formidable weapon.
The bird uses it very effectively on the woodwork of the aviary, and if
you have occasion to handle it, very stout gloves are advisable. In my
hybrids the bill is still larger, and they easily bite through the wire
netting of their aviary. One Sunday morning early this month I was
aroused early in the morning by the screams of Parrots outside my
bedroom window, and on looking out I was in time to see a little flight
of five iust disappearing over the tops of some high elm-trees. One of
the hybrid Macaws had eaten a large hole through the roof of the aviary
and let its companions out. For three or four days they remained
together, visiting all the neighbouring villages, and subsisting,
apparently upon leaves and bark, for as far as I know they were never
seen upon the ground. They looked very pretty soaring 40 or 50
yards in the air, and their loud calls could be heard half a mile away.
" Reminds one of India," I heard one comrade say to another as the birds
flew over their heads, and it is really a pity that it is not safe to leave
this kind of bird at liberty, as even if one could train them to come back
regularly to food, they would, as things are now, sooner or later fall
victims to the man with the gun. Of my birds, the wire-cutter found
its way back after five days' liberty, two others were captured in
neighbouring villages, and two are still missing. These birds are quite
hardy, and I was surprised that they made no attempt to breed. In
their own country they nest in holes in cliffs and river-banks, so I had
some nest-boxes sunk into a bank in their aviary, but they made no
use of them ; possibly they may have been interfered with when on the
ground by my Mantchurian Pheasants, or they may not be true pairs.

Parrot, but are hardly as large. Their general body colour is green ;
primaries of wings edged with black ; outer webs of tail-feathers bright
blue; under tail coverts, scarlet; head, brown; cheeks, brown,
each feather edged with brown, giving it a pretty scaly appearance ;
bill, yellow ; bare skin around eye, white. They are rather quiet and
apathetic in their demeanour, but this may be due to their rather
rough condition. If they improve I shall try and breed from them
next season.

A NATURALIST IN HIMALAYA 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99751675" page_id="32670587"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
The author of this book is a very keen observer, and has made most
careful and minute studies of the habits of the creatures around him
during a residence in the Himalayan Valley of Hazara, between the
years 1915 and 1916. The accounts he gives of the life-history of the
various species of ants, spiders, butterflies, and such-like creatures are
fascinating, but all point to the following of a blind propelling instinct
with complete lack of reasoning power. The author describes the
method employed by the Harvester Ants in collecting their winter
store of grain ; how the carnivorous species, Phidole inclica, on finding
its prey, hurries back to the nest to communicate the intelligence to
the army of workers and soldiers waiting for such a call; how the
geometrical spider constructs its wonderful snare with mathematical
precision. These and other small creatures have the secrets of their
lives divulged in this fascinating volume, which, however, is not entirely
confined to these small fry. The author has a chapter of observations
on mammals, in which he deals with the leopard, Himalayan monkey,
and flying squirrel, and another on birds, in which his remarks and
deductions on soaring flight, migration, nesting instinct, and so forth
are particularly interesting and instructive. There is not much
aviculture in this volume, but as the majority of aviculturists are

Sirs, --With reference to your footnote on my letter in the December
Magazine with regard to my Chestnut-winged Amydrus, may I point
out that in Gould's Birds of Asia, vol. v, there is a coloured plate of
A. tristrami exactly resembling my pair of Amydrus from Africa. I
cannot find Hagiopsar tristrami in Gould's works. He names it Amydrus
tristrami, with no synonym, and wrote : " There cannot be the slightest
doubt as to Amydrus tristrami being a good species. It is nearly allied
to A. fulvipennis of South and South-Western Africa. The size of both
species is the same."
That my birds may be A. morio I do not dispute, but judging by
Gould's plate they appear as identical with A. tristrami.
These birds seem to be hardy, for although only lately imported
they are thriving in an outdoor aviary, and even moulted in November

[Sharpe separated the Palestine species from the African birds
{Amydrus), calling it Hagiopsar, of which genus it is the only repre-
sentative. -- Eds.]

If I was asked which I prefer of the birds I actually possess, I think
the reply would be : " My Long-tailed Roller," although there are some
good birds in my cages, such as Cuban Trogon, King Bird of Paradise,
Giant, Hoary, and Black-collared Barbets, Cossyphas, several species
of Sun-birds, Black-backed Tanager (Calliste melanonota), etc., and
nearly all of them are very tame and amusing. The only bird which
might almost surpass the Roller is a charming purple-capped Lory,
whose affection for my attendant and myself is really wonderful, and
makes one think of a pet dog.
But the Roller possesses altogether the four most important qualities
for a bird in captivity : beautiful plumage, tameness, sensibility, and
rarity. Rollers are amongst the most difficult birds to keep in good
condition. At liberty they feed mostly on the wing, and they need
much exercise to keep in good health. As they fear the cold and can
only be kept in summer in an outdoor aviary, it is rather difficult to
give them enough room to fly about and a good temperature all the
year round, unless the bird is so tame that it can be handled at any
time, and this is the case with mine.
Another thing is that it is often difficult to accustom Rollers to
captivity ; Major Millet-Horsin, Medical Officer to the French Colonial
Army, who has spent years in studying and catching birds in Africa,

and is a great authority on the fauna of that part of the world, told me
that it was only last year, after about twelve years' trial, that he
succeeded in keeping a Roller in captivity, in the native country of the
bird !
When I obtained my Long-tailed Roller, in January, 1920, he was
a very ugly greenish-grey creature, with dreadfully dirty feathers. But
his tameness, coupled with the pleasure I found in acquiring a Roller,
which was certainly not the well-known Indian species, was quite
sufficient to make me happy. I did not know exactly which species
he belonged to, as several are found in Africa, and the information I had
about his native country was somewhat uncertain.
As my bird-rooms were not quite ready at the time, Mme. Lecallier
kindly took the Roller en &apos;pension and at my next visit I saw some
lilac feathers appearing amongst the grey ones of the breast, showing
that beyond doubt the bird was the Long-tailed Roller, Coracias
caudatus.
He went through the moult within two months, and was in full
plumage in April. His tameness soon made him a pet and he flew about
loose in Mme. Lecallier&apos;s bird-room until May. But then, the bird-room
having been closed for some reason, the Roller was confined in a cage,
and three weeks later had a fit and very nearly died. No doubt that was
occasioned by lack of exercise. My place being ready by this time, I
took the Roller with me and let him out in one of the bird-rooms.
He recovered in a few days, and has never ceased to be in perfect health
since. He moulted again in August, and is now in perfect plumage.
He has a roomy wooden cage, where he sleeps, and is left until 11 a.m.,
when the cleaning of the room is finished ; then he is let out and enjoys
liberty in the room until 8 p.m. He sits on the cages and on the top of
the aviaries, has some discussions with the Giant Barbet through the
wire of the aviary, and takes a flight almost every two minutes. When
I come in he flies to me, opens his wonderful blue wings in salute,
uttering his loud crow-like call, and he takes the keenest interest in
everybody and everything. His diet consists of insectile mixture, a
little raw meat, and half a dozen mealworms a day. He touches apples
sometimes, and altogether wants rather a large quantity of food.
I believe that the only Long-tailed Roller which has ever been

imported alive into Europe before was the bird that the Berlin Zoological
Gardens had in 1912, and I think it did not live very long there.
The Long-tailed Roller is common throughout Central Africa, from
Angola to Zanzibar. It is a shy bird, living in hilly, wooded countries.
Like all its congeners it feeds on insects caught on the wing, and nests
in holes of trees. The plumage of the Long-tailed Roller is extremely
handsome : top of the head and hind neck, dark green ; white eye-
brows ; cheeks, violet chestnut; throat and chest, rich lilac streaked
with white--especially on the throat in my bird, this beautiful lilac
colour extends up to the cheeks, and there is very little difference in
the colouring of the cheeks and that of the breast; underparts, light
turquoise blue ; back, greenish cinnamon ; wings, bright light blue and
rich dark blue ; light blue tail with central feathers dark greenish
blue, and the two outermost rectrices elongated, very pale blue with
black thin ends ; bill, black ; feet, grey. The males and females of this
species have the same plumage, so that I have no idea of the sex of
my bird.

The crime of civilization is its callous disregard of the wasteful
exploitations of wild life, which go on in the name of sport and
of commerce. What better off will the world be that the fur-seals and
right whales have ever existed on this planet when the last moth-eaten
garment is thrown on the rubbish-heap and the last cask of oil
exhausted ? What shall repay future generations for the barbarous
destruction of the beautiful Egrets and the ill-used Penguins that are
driven alive along roads ending over boiling caldrons in Maquari
Islands ? Who can tell what evils we are laying up for future
generations by this wanton destruction of Nature's guardians of sea
and land ? A chain has but the strength of its weakest link. Slowly
and surely man is undermining the foundations on which life itself
rests. We know that there are some live forms whose work is so
important to man that living they are worth their weight in gold,

whereas, dead, their value is counted in pence or at most a few paltry
shillings.
Think of Australia, the wonderful world museum of antiquities,
with its living fossils, the one open living page of an otherwise long-
closed book ; of its faunal and floral types of a long-dead past; its
aboriginal inhabitants belonging to the Stone Age !
Australia in the past has not proved worthy of this great charge,
which should have been held in trust for the whole world. Already
some of her unique treasures have gone into the eternal silences ;
others are perilously near the vanishing point. To many of her
scientists engrossed in the study of bones, relics and fossils, to which
so many give the higher value, are failing in their duty to the valuable
living types that are theirs to save--the Marsupialia, Monotremata,
Flightless Birds, and the Mound-builders.
One of the most interesting of these living types is the Mallee Fowl
(Lipoa ocellata), inhabiting the waterless Mallee-lands of Western and
South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, and subsisting upon
seeds of the acacia, berries and insects, and drinking, apparently, only
dew-drops hanging from the leaves. Apart from the menace of the fox
and gun, the bird is doomed by the advance of settlement, for it
cannot exist in the open lands.
For many years I made a special study of this bird, making
periodical trips into the Mallee-lands, suffering heat, hunger, and thirst
in the big lone lands, sleeping beneath the stars with the scant tracery
of leaves overhead, and the scent of the broom in my nostrils, listening
to the solemn booming notes of the cock Mallee Fowl and pondering
the mysteries of creation.
It was thus I learnt much of the life-history of these wonderful
birds, even the art of mound-building, which I then occasionally built
and successfully worked at my camp. The absorbing interest attaching
to such a work was a sure preventative of any feeling of loneliness, and
four, five, and sometimes six weeks would slip by ere I broke camp and
left these solitudes. Expenses had to be met by capturing and supplying
to various zoological societies a few of these same Mallee Fowl. This
removal of pairs from the mounds finally settled the sex habit and
proved them not communistic as supposed, but solitary. It was in

these wilds I early disproved the statement (found in some of our
leading works on Australian birds) that the wing is used to sweep the
material together for the mound. This is never the case, the feet alone
being used.
Much of my work had to be done over and over again, but slowly
the life-history of this bird was unravelled. It is monogamic, and
apparently mates for life. The construction and maintenance of
mounds, chiefly performed by the male, entail a labour of about nine
months' duration. The birds choose a site that will be exposed to the
sun's rays during the heat of the day, preferring a slope that faces the
sun. A pit is dug about 12 inches deep, the soil being banked around the
edge, and the measurement from bank to bank being from 7 to 9 feet.
The thick accumulation of debris (fallen leaves, bark, etc.) is then raked
from under the Mallee into the more open ways that lead to the pit.
By preference this is taken from the higher side of the pit, it being much
easier for the birds to rake it downwards than up the slope. When the
required material has all been raked into the clear open runs that lead
to the pit, the male, starting nearest to the pit, but facing outwards,
proceeds with a sweeping throwing motion of the foot to pass the
material behind him, a few strokes with each foot, then he moves
forward, keeping this up until he reaches the end of the row. Then
retracing his steps to the pit, he proceeds as before, keeping this going
at frequent intervals until the whole of the material is heaped high
in the pit, which is left awaiting the rains, and beyond occasional
stirrings of the surface there is not much done for a time. Then, as
spring approaches, the desiccation of the surface and core commences.
This work lasts a considerable time. We will suppose spring is here
and the hour is 9.30 a.m. The male appears, proud and dignified of
mien, the female sedately following, always, at this time of laying,
uttering at very frequent and regular intervals a low, soothing and
pleasing note, to which the male occasionally responds in a deeper
tone. Proceeding to the top of the mound, the birds, relieving each
other at intervals, make an excavation reaching into the loose core or
e gg-chamber, terminating the excavation in a small cup-like hole.
Placed against its solid wall, the female, with legs straddling across this
small hole, head down along her breast and facing the wall, presses

forward, opens her wings, slightly withdraws her head, and with that
movement the large pink egg slips into its prepared place. Her part is
now done -- she quietly glides away into the shade of a bush. The male
now gives his attention to the egg, which has probably fallen a little
out of the perpendicular. Choosing a spot about an inch away from the
egg, he thrusts his beak into the sand up to his forehead, then pushing
forward and using this sand as a cushion, he brings the egg to an upright
position. With the withdrawal of his head the sand falls and keeps
the egg upright and on its small end, in contact with the solid wall
of heating material. The reason for this action is twofold ; first, the
shell is too fragile for direct contact with the bird's head, and second,
the falling sand prevents the egg from again falling forward. All eggs
in the egg-chamber must be so placed that the chicks emerge in the
right direction to gain their liberty. On their sides they would meet
their death against the hard walls of the egg-chamber. The male now
replaces the blanket of sand and fine leaf-material, sometimes covering
the eggs to a depth of about two feet. The thickness of this covering
has been noticed to vary with weather conditions. This hard and
laborious work during the heat of the day is done in several shifts,
and intervals of rest are taken. The period of incubation is about fifty-
five days. The heat required is from 85 degrees to 96 degrees Fahr.
The eggs are laid at intervals varying from three to seven or even eight
days. The number is aBout thirty, varying according to the age of the
bird and the season. There is also a big variation in the incubation
period, the extreme noted being in one case ninety-nine days. This
must have been due to retarded incubation.
In addition to bottom heat, a very frequent use is made of solar
heat, the mound being frequently opened out to within an inch or two
of the eggs, and, as the material gathers heat, it is replaced layer by layer,
the intervals allowing for the next layer to become heated. I have seen
the. male putting on extra covering by moonlight as late as 8.30 p.m.
on the approach of a change in the weather. This is done to conserve
the heat that has been gathered during the day.
Both birds frequently test the heat of the egg-chamber. This is
done by thrusting the beak up to the forehead into its walls, and holding
it there for several seconds. I think they are guided by this test as to
the amount of sun heat required.

We will suppose that two months have expired. The mound now
contains nine eggs and a chick which broke its shell at noon yesterday.
That it is near the surface we know by that slight depression. Its
shoulders are upward, and with them it is boring through the loose
sandy covering, ever pressing the falling sand under its feet. Its head
is bent down along its breast; its nostrils protected by a shield of
bristles. There is a heaving motion with falling sand in the depression.
Another heave and a little head shoots into view, and a staggering chick
drops back into the hollow from which it has emerged. Its eyes are
closed ; it is perfectly still, resting after its subterranean journey,
which had lasted for twenty hours. It is 8 a.m., and the shadows of
the nearby mallee are just leaving the mound. The long journey
upward seems to be always made in the night. I have never known a
chick emerge during the heat of the day. They would surely perish
in the attempt, let alone clashing with the male's duty of testing the
sun's heat. Always they come in the cooler, quieter hours of early
morn. The chick lifts its head and takes its first long look around.
Then with a staggering run it disappears into the bushes.
A Bronzewing Pigeon barely alights on the mound, when from
an adjacent bush the cock Mallee rushes forth, crest up, plumage ruffled,
wings open, and dashes at the sacrilegious intruder. There is a sharp
clap clap of wings, and the pigeon is gone. Then comes a softly uttered
warning from the bushes, and with one eye turned skyward the cock
gently lowers his body to earth. There he lies perfectly motionless,
his colours blending perfectly with the leaf-scattered soil. See ! just
a dark speck high in the blue ; it is a Wedge-tailed Eagle. Unwinking,
the eye of the Mallee follows the moving speck right into the glare of the
sun ; not a movement until that monster of the skies has passed from
view, then, with a softly uttered who-how, he again ascends the mound.
The female comes forth from her hiding and proceeds to scratch around
the base of that structure, intent on a beetle-hunt among the loose
debris and coarser material there scattered. Meanwhile the male is
busy opening the mound. The chick we saw run into the bushes has
already taken up the burden of life. Should we give him a fright he
will rise and fly a full hundred yards and again hide in a bush.
Independent and capable, he quickly acquires the wisdom of the bush

folk. His third season finds him calling and listening up and down the
long green aisles, ever seeking his kindred spirit that shall walk and
work with him through the ever changing seasons. Should he find a
mate some preparation is made for the coming season, but usually
it is the fourth season before domestic duties are taken up in earnest.
And now, though my wanderings in the Mallee have- come to an
end, and much of the Mallee is a waste of shifting sand, yet the solemn
booming wh-whoo-oome, whoo-oome of the Mallee cock still falls upon
my ear; in the silence of evening and early morn it is heard, and the
sound recalls the days of my wanderings.
I do not now need to hunt the lonely bush-lands for this beautiful
creature and its wonderful mounds, for within 30 yards of where I sit
and write there are two complete mounds, one of which has been
producing chicks for the past six years. The other belongs to a young
pair, and is their first attempt. The birds are content, and would not
leave, but because of the foxes they have to be enclosed in netted yards,
which include plenty of shady bush-cover. Here, with our shyest of
wild creatures, I have proved that we can save from utter destruction
Australia's valuable fauna. I have had good success with other species,
but I am proudest of the fact that I have won the confidence of this
most shy and retiring of Nature's children of the bush, and done what
was said to be an impossibility--bred these birds in captivity. Eggs
that I have weighed averaged two to the pound. They are of good
flavour, and are frequently hunted by the settlers for food.
The laws of nature are wise laws. The representatives of wild life,
native to each land and sea, we know, hold an important place in
nature, seemingly fitting into their places like bits of mosaic, each
important to all, all to each ; and subject to certain modifications, due
to civilization, the fauna of each country is best fitted to control the
balance of that country.

QUAIL BREEDING IN JAPAN

become very different from that of the wild birds. The domestic birds
sing " Qua grrrr ", instead of " Qua kali ", the usual wild song. The
Japanese praise this style of song, i.e. " Qua grrr ". It reminds one of
the sound of distant thunder, and high prices are asked for birds which
prolong the sound of " grrr " longest.
Those who like the Quails or to hear their song often meet together
with their Quails at a club, restaurant, or similar place, and judge the
song of the Quails, the best birds receiving a prize and being registered.
Many people name their Quails as they do race-horses. Such meetings
were often held in the Middle Tokugawa period, and the daimyos
and rich people of that period kept their favourite Quails in cages
made of precious wood, ivory, or raised lacquer, inlaid with gold, silver,
and shells, and decorated with beautiful coloured silk braid. It was
said that such cages were usually made.in pairs, and the meetings were
held in the early morning, for the Quails sing their song best in the
morning or the evening. It is true that the Quails sing best at those
times, but at present many people disregard the time, for the Quails
sing quite freely at all hours while on show, performing repeatedly
against each other. During recent years an added interest in keeping
Quails is that the hen lays at least 150 to 250 eggs in one year, and the
laying season can be arranged at the will of the keeper. A further
interest lies in getting the Quails to lay in small cages, made of bamboo
bars, and measuring four-fifths of a foot square, the top being netted
over and the floor strewn with sand, the Quail being a species of game-
bird and addicted to sand-baths.
The birds are fed like the canary of England, in the sense that the
food is suspended at an opening at the side of the cage. Quails are fed
on a kind of soft food, called by the Japanese " Suriye ", which is
composed of river fish smoked, dried, and ground to a powder, and
mixed with meal of roasted rice and chaff. Bean-meal is sometimes
added to this. The animal food is called " Namaye " and the meal
" Kinako ", or " Ko ". The silver carp and a kind of dace (Leuciscus
macropus) are commonly used for " Namaye ", but the dace is said to
be preferable to any other fish. " Kinako " is composed of equal
parts of roasted rice-meal and chaff, and the quantity of bean-meal is
left to the will of the person who uses it. The usual proportions for the

mixture are one part of fish-foocl to two parts of meal. When the
Japanese wish the birds to lay they put the cage under artificial light
for about two or three hours after dark. At the same time the proportion
of animal food is sometimes increased by nearly one-half, but according
to my experience that is rather too strong for many birds. Some people
also put the birds all night long under artificial light, but I think this
also is not necessary, for I find no better results from this method.
After the birds have been fed with an increased proportion of animal
food for about a week or two the male birds begin to sing and the
females to utter a cry, something like the cry of the barn-door hen when
she wishes to lay. Sometimes the female lays an egg without any
preliminary announcement. When the males begin to sing and the
females to utter the cry, they are mated every morning by setting the
cages side by side and opening the entrances. After this the females
lay their egg once every day. Another way of testing the female's
readiness to lay is to place one's hand on the top of the cage, when if
the females are broody they lie down on the floor of the cage and utter
a cry which resembles the scolding cry which a hen utters when sitting.
The females lay six to seven eggs in succession, then cease for a day or
two before beginning again. I think it is better to stop the laying after
the keeper has obtained from fifty to sixty eggs and rest the birds
three or four weeks. It is very surprising that the eggs have increased
from one-third to twice their size since Quail breeding was first favoured.
It is very easy to stop the birds from laying by removing the cages from
under the artificial light at night, and keeping the birds in the dark.
The birds left in the dark very soon begin to moult. During the moult
we feed the birds with seeds. It is very interesting to note that the
time of laying is an hour later every day, and that when the female
finishes she announces the fact by a few cheerful cries.
The cages are washed and cleaned every two or three days, and if
the climate is hot and wet every other day, because the cages are small
and the food juicy, and the Quails need dry ground to stand on, like
other game-birds. The egg of the Quail is as large as the first thumb-
joint, measuring about one inch in length, and its colour is a pale
yellowish olive, splashed with dark-brown markings, which are some-
times large, sometimes small, sometimes dense, and sometimes sparse,

and the egg of a properly treated bird is chalky on the surface. Some
people say the egg which is not chalky is not fertile, but this is not
always true, for I have obtained chicks from some which were not
chalky. The eggs can be hatched under a bantam-hen or in an
incubator, which I find answers equally well.
The chicks come out from the eggs in about sixteen or seventeen
days. After leaving the shell they are kept without any food or treat-
ment by the keeper for about twenty or twenty-four hours. &apos; The chicks
which are under twenty or twenty-four hours' old are too weak to be
left alone, though they are very active soon after hatching, and if we
transfer such young birds from the foster-mother to the nursing-box
they will at first run about here and there, seemingly very happy, but
alas ! one by one they become faint and die from exhaustion. Some-
times they survive the exhaustion, but many such birds have malformed
legs, and are quite unable to stand or walk, owing to imperfect
ossification of the legs.
When the chicks are put in a nursing-box another clutch of eggs
can be placed under the hen. The hen can sit on two consecutive
sittings. The chicks in a nursing-box are fed with the paste mentioned
in the former paragraph, by plastering it on a board which leans
diagonally against the wall of the box. The one thing the breeder should
always bear in mind is that the paste often adheres to the chick's bill
and covers the nostrils and eyes. This often blinds or suffocates the
birds. Hence the breeder must watch them, and if he finds the paste
sticking to the bill he must remove it without delay. If the paste on
the bill hardens it can be removed with ease by cleaning the bill with
a piece of wet cloth. The nursing-box, in size 1 foot by 2\ feet, is
partitioned into two chambers by a screen, one chamber measuring
2 feet, and the other 6 inches. The latter, heated by a lamp or other
apparatus such as is used in a vivarium, is the bedroom for the chicks,
which when put in the box can already run about easily, and soon find
their food and learn how to eat. I find it better at first to put the food
board at a distance of about two-thirds of the length of the large
chamber from the screen, and to draw it further away as the chicks
grow, and to have the paste at first very moist, then by degrees to get
it drier, until the ordinary consistency is reached.

Stray Notes
When the chicks grow as large as the chick of a domestic fowl, we
stop heating the bedroom, except on cold or wet days. When they
change their down to feathers the chicks are treated in the same manner
as the parent birds. They mature at the end of three months. In this
way the Japanese easily propagate their Quail families from a small
stock, and obtain in a short time many eggs to eat and birds to give
them song. The eggs are very good to eat when put in soup or jelly,
boiled, and also fresh. I find the fresh, uncooked egg nicer than the
hen's egg, since it is richer, although not so strong as the duck's egg.
Some persons are over confident that Quail's eggs have more
nourishment than the hen's, and in the olden times the Japanese
thought them a good medicine for a paralytic.
The flesh of the Quail fed on soft food is not good for eating purposes.
They must be fed upon seeds and grains some weeks before being used
for the table. Then the flesh is very delicious.

Breeding the Ivagu. --Our member Mr. G. A. Heumann, writing
from his home in New South Wales, tells of the successful breeding of
the Kagu in his aviaries. When he wrote in November the young bird
was nine weeks old, and still being fed by its parents, who were most
attentive to its needs, one or other being always with it. The young
bird, he says, always runs between its parents, and unlike most chicks
which follow their mother, the young Kagu makes its parents follow it.
The Amethyst Starling. -- The Zoological Society has received
a beautiful specimen of the South African form of the Amethyst
Starling (Pholidauges leucogaster verreauxi), presented by its corre-
sponding member, Dr. Harold Miller, Superintendent of the Zoological
Gardens at Durban. The Society has only once before possessed an
Amethyst Starling, a specimen of the typical form from West Africa
presented by Dr. Hopkinson, but these are not the only ones that have
been imported. Mr. Hamlyn had some four or five specimens in one
of his South African consignments some few months ago, which were,
I believe, bought by Mons. Delacour. Amethyst Starlings are some of
the most beautiful of the Glossy Starlings, the whole of the upper surface

being of a brilliant metallic copper colour with purple and violet
reflections, while the under-surface from the chest downwards is pure
white. The typical form Pholidauges leucogaster occurs in West as well
as in North-east Africa, while P. 1. verreauxi, whmh differs in having
white on the outer tail-feathers, is confined to South Africa, and a third
form, P. sharpei, occurs in East Africa.
Sexing Birds. --I think there is a great deal in the theory put
forward by Miss Knobel as to the distance apart of the pelvic bones
in the sexes of birds. It is well known amongst poultry-keepers that
these bones are considerably farther apart in a bird that is in laying
condition than in one that is not laying, in fact, hens and pullets are
constantly examined to ascertain if they are laying or not. At the
Zoological Gardens a few hens are kept as foster-mothers for young
Pheasants, etc., and during last year a fair number of young Silkies
were reared for this purpose; there are three cockerels and a number of
pullets, and I have examined these. I find that in the cocks the two
bones are barely half an inch apart, this dimension being exceeded
by all of the pullets. Some of the latter have commenced to lay, and
these have the pelvic bones more than an inch apart; in one case
the distance was an inch and three-qaurters, while in those birds that
had not commenced to lay the distance was about three-quarters of
an inch.

The Auk. Yol. XXXVIII, No. 1. 1921.
This number of the organ of the American Ornithologists' Union
opens with an interesting account of the habits of the Dickcissel (Spiza
americana), otherwise popularly known as the " Little Meadowlark",
or Black-throated Bunting, of the prairies of Illinois, by Dr. Alfred 0.
Gross. This first instalmant deals with the geographical range of the
species, its distribution in Illinois and its migrations, its sexual and
seasonal coloration, measurements, etc., its general behaviour and song.
The paper is illustrated with four photographic plates, three of which
show nests in situ with eggs or nestlings.

Equally interesting is the first part of a paper by Mr. Harrison F.
Lewis on the nesting of the Philadelphia Vireo ( Vireosylva
philadelphica) . This is couched in the form of a diary of observations
extending from Jun% 11 to July 3, 1919, and the facts recorded attest
a degree of perseverance and patience on the part of the observer which
will appeal to all lovers of wild birds. Mr. H. Mousley continues his
notes on the birds of Hatley, Stanstead Co., Quebec, adding five species
to the list published in 1918&apos;; and Mr. Horace W. Wright publishes the
known records of the occurrence of the Bohemian Waxwing ( Bombycilla
garrula) in New England, frequently in the company of the Cedar
Waxwing ( Bombycilla cedrorum). Other papers dealing with systematic
ornithology call for no special notice ; but it may be added that the
part concludes with more than twenty pages of general notes on
American birds and with reviews of recent literature.
Early Annals of Ornithology. By J. H. Gurney, F.Z.S. London :
H. F. &amp; G. Witherby. 1921. Price 125. Qd. net.
Members of the Avicultural Society familiar with Mr. J. H. Gurney's
book on the Gannet will not be disappointed with his latest achievement,
Early Annals of Ornithology. Starting in the first chapter with the
prehistoric sketches left by men of the early and later Stone Ages, the
pictures of ancient Egypt and the bas-reliefs of Babylon, with references
to the written records in the Bible and classical literature, Mr. Gurney
deals in order with the centuries of the Christian era, telling us about
the birds known in Britain to the Romans, Saxons, and Piets, and so
on down to the eighteenth century, finishing up with Pennant. There
are numerous quotations from ancient writers and many reproductions
of old engravings, and naturally there is a good deal to be said about
hawking in the past; but perhaps, if a selection be made, the most
interesting section of the book is the chapter dealing with the history
of the Crane, Bustard, Spoonbill, and Bittern in Great Britain, a chapter
sandwiched in between those treating of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.
From what has been said it may be inferred that the bibliographical
work involved in the compilation of the volume has been considerable.

and Mr. Gurney is to be congratulated upon having compressed his
extensive subject-matter into some 230 pages. After the monotonous
publication of book after book upon British Birds, each one little more
than a repetition of its predecessor, it has been a great treat to us to
read Mr. Gurney's work, and we most cordially recommend it to
members of our Society. It is well produced in every way, and is
illustrated with maps and photographs as well as with the copies of
old engravings above referred to.

Anthropoides leucogeranus
Mr. F. E. Blaauw, in his beautiful monograph on the Cranes, while
protesting against the further splitting up of the family, admits three
genera, and places the White Asiatic Crane in the second genus,
Anthropoides, with the Demoiselle, Wattled, Stanley, and the White-
naped species.
According to Mr. Blaauw's views, the White-naped and the Crane
under notice are closely related. Extremely little is known of the
habits of the A. leucogeranus, except what has been written about it
by Mr. A. 0. Hume ; and all subsequent writers quote at length from
his very detailed and graphic description, for there is no other
information accessible about the bird in its wild state.
Hume wrote of the bird as he knew it wintering in Northern India,
but not very much is to be learned of birds which we only know as
winter visitors, as then they are mainly occupied by questions of food
and self-preservation Pallas describes the nest, which he found in
1773, and I believe no recent writer has seen this Crane in its summer
home in the Siberian morasses. I have had four or five of these Cranes
at various times, but, apart from its beauty, have found the bird less
friendly to its owner and generally less interesting than most members
of the family. But I have not had the fortune to possess a good pair
and we never had a nest here. At Lilford I believe eggs have been
laid, but they were unfertile, and the splendid pair at the London

Zoological Gardens have often nested and incubated steadily, with no
better result, and I think this Crane has not bred in captivity in Europe.
There is one portion of Hume's description of this bird to which I should
like to draw atteution. He says that he examined over twenty
specimens (killed between October and March), and that he never
found a trace of any animal food in their stomachs. He considered it
exclusively a vegetable feeder, for he only found " rush seeds, bulbs,
conns, and even leaves of aquatic plants ", but never found remains of
fish, reptiles, or grain. But though this was the case in India and in
winter, I have seen enough of this bird to cause me to feel sure that it is
otherwise at other seasons of the year. I have found it a confirmed egg-
stealer, and I believe that this has been the case at Lilford also. I once
saw one of my White Cranes carrying off a Great Bustard's egg, with the
contents dripping on to the ground while the disconsolate mother
followed mournfully behind the robber at a few yards distance, and I
have elsewhere in the Magazine recorded the intelligent -way in which
my White Cranes stationed themselves at dusk near some high wire
netting fences and strode off when they heard the netting struck to
pick up the beetle before it could get on the wing again.
My impression is that this Crane requires at least as much animal
food in confinement as the other species. It also should, if possible,
have access to some pond or shallow stream, for it is very aquatic in
its habits.

By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, F.Z.S.
The sciences of ornithology and aviculture are intimately con-
nected. Each has much to learn from the other. Many of the problems
of the lives of birds can only be solved through the keeping of them
in confinement. I think there are amongst ornithologists some who do
not set much reliance on the behaviour of aviary birds in such matters
as seasonal changes of plumage, the assumption of mature or breeding
plumage, periods of incubation, breeding habits, the manner of rearing
their young, etc. The skilled aviculturist can tell at once when con-
finement, diet, or environment in any way alters the natural order of
his charges' lives.

E. G. B. Meade-Waldo--Ornithology and Aviculture 35
The ages to which birds live in a purely natural state can only be
guess-work, but as many species, including small passerine birds, live
long lives in confinement, it may be assumed that without accident
at least the same ages woidd be attained in a wild state. Keepers of
Waterfowl can note the changes of plumage of both sexes in their birds
far more correctly than it is possible to note them from skins or from
observing wild birds, as it is impossible to tell the ages of the latter
with any certainty. Wildfowl, of course, can be kept in a condition
almost the same as in nature. The extraordinary habits of the Sand-
grouse in conveying water to their young by the male saturating his
breast could never have been discovered except by accident in a wild
state, while the curious seasonal changes of plumage would have
remained a puzzle. The age to which these birds live could never have
been guessed by those who only know them wild or as skins. The
aviculturist has, I believe, not by any means overcome some of the
problems of aviculture. Why do the Flamingoes keep their rose-
coloured feathers in full beauty for years in confinement, often under
extremely unnatural feeding, while the Scarlet Ibis loses its colour at
once and never recovers it, but remains dull pink ? I am not sure that
it is easy to get the Linnet to retain its rose colour after having
moulted out in a cage ? While the Rose Finches never do ; the
Crossbill never resumes the full red colour after moulting. The Pine
Grosbeak keeps in perfect colour for years. Yellow and pink are the
two colours which remain a puzzle; in many cases when lost these never
are regained in their full brilliance. An example of this is in the Great
and Lesser Birds of Paradise. The yellow of the head in the adult birds
is replaced in confinement by a yellowish cream, all other colours are
replaced as in nature ; the same applies to the twelve-wired Bird of
Paradise, Seleucides niger.
It is by studying birds in confinement alone that the question of
colour change in feathers can be proved. My own experience is that
there is no change in the colour of any feather when it is once grown
beyond that of intensity of colouring dependent on the vigour of the
bird, all change must come through moult, tip-moulting, or abrasion.
It is to be hoped that these various questions may be taken up by
members of the Society. There is much of real interest in them both
to the aviculturist and the ornithologist.

While staying for a short period this year in Corsica I was able to
observe a few of the birds there ; but unfortunately my notes are
brief and unscientific, for I had two handicaps--first, having no
binoculars with me and, secondly, having with me a friend who took
not the slightest interest in ornithological matters ; this latter was
perhaps the most trying.
How different is Corsica in the way of bird life from Southern
France and Italy, where most of the sweet songsters are transformed
into " petits oiseaux ", as they are called on the menu. Corsica is
teeming with bird life and one could spend a delightful holiday in the
spring time " bird-watching ". How so many of these so-called
ornithologists can go about as I have seen them do shooting down every
feathered creature whose species they are not sure of is beyond me.
If on a holiday I were to kill only one bird I should feel the " pangs
of conscience " for the rest of the time.
One of the first of the feathered tribe that meets the eye is the
Chaffinch--he' seems everywhere, and is much commoner than the
sparrow ; the latter seems to keep on the outskirts of the towns, and
is much cleaner and lighter in colour than his English brethren, and
several I saw had black crescent-shaped marks on the flanks; indeed,
Passer domesticus looked so different that my friend was sure that
they were Whitethroats !
Another very common finch is the lovely Goldfinch. Around
Calvi there were literally hundreds. They frequented the waste ground
by the sea, and seemed to be feeding from the dead heads of the thistle
and teazel; but upon examination of these heads there was no trace
of seed in them. Unfortunately one sees many of these bright songsters
in tiny cages hanging outside the poorer class of houses in Corsica.
Greenfinches are also numerous, and at Ajaccio flocks were seen in
the orchards near the town. In these orchards were also seen the lovely
iittle Citril and Serin Finches. The types of these finches inhabiting
Corsica are supposed to differ from those on the mainland ; they are
cheerful, restless little birds, always moving from the ground to the

trees and back again. I saw them often in the company of Green-
finches ; their song was heard from an olive- or orange-tree, and it was
something like that of the Goldfinch. Another bird that was noticed
near Ajaccio was the Crossbill, but of the species I am not sure. I
dare say it was the common kind. These birds we saw in the fir- and
pine-trees, and they first attracted our attention by their incessant
chatter which was kept up all the while they were feeding. Several
pine cones that seemed to be torn to pieces were found under the trees.
This was no doubt the work of the Crossbills.
Several Marsh Buntings were seen, or at least I think that they were.
These birds are somewhat like the Reed Bunting, but larger and darker
in colour. A very common bird just outside the towns was the
Ortolan Bunting. One saw little parties of about three to six searching
for food on the roads. They seemed very tame, and would allow
approach within about ten yards of them. There were many other
kinds of Buntings, but I was quite unable to distinguish their species.
There were also Pipits which haunted the seashore, but the Pipit family
are usually dark and with very little difference between the species,
so they are hard to identify at a distance. Skylarks were common,
too. Thrushes and Blackbirds were far from being numerous, their
scarcity being due to the fact that they were in demand for the " pet ".
I noticed several Thrushes on the rocks by the sea at Ajaccio. They
were about the size of a Blackbird and of a dark-brown colour, with
the chin, throat, and breast rufous. They moved about in the same
manner as a Dipper, jerking the tail and flirting the wings. What
species they were I do not know ; perhaps some other member of
the Society can enlighten me.
The most charming bird to my mind was the sweet little Sardinian
Warbler. He seemed everywhere--away in the mountains, by the sea-
shore, and even in the hotel gardens. He is somewhat after the same
style as the Dartford Warbler, only stouter in build. The head is
jet black and the whole of the underparts pure white ; the upper parts
are delicate grey, the long tail is dark grey with the outer feathers
white, the iris is bright yellow, which gives the bird a rather unique
appearance. He is a restless and lively little bird, and hops continually
through the low bushes of rosemary and cistus that cover the un-

cultivated parts by the seashore, and every now and then flies on
to the topmost branch of a bush and surveys the world, swelling his
white throat and jerking his tail meanwhile, but as soon as one
approaches dives into the bushes again. The coloration of this
little bird makes him one of the most noticeable of the smaller Corsican
birds in the winter time, though in the summer time he would be
outrivailed by the gorgeous Rollers and Bee-eaters.
The Dartford Warbler I only saw once, and that was near Calvi.
It was behaving in the same way as the Sardinian Warbler. Blackcaps
are very common, and one sees them everywhere, especially in the palm-
trees, searching for insects at the base of the huge leaves.
Numerous yellowish green warblers were seen in the trees and
bushes near the towns. These may have been Yellow-browed
Warblers. Great Tits and Blue Tits were comparatively common in
the orchards, as was the familiar Robin, which looked quite out of
place perched on the cactus hedges.
The Stonechat was very noticeable everywhere one went. One was
sure to see him either perched on some dead plant or on the telegraph
wires uttering his strange notes.
Wagtails were numerous, especially the yellow ones. I think these
must have been Grey-headed Wagtails. These were one of the few
birds one saw in the streets of the towns ; Pied Wagtails were also
seen, but what species they were I do not know, for ornithologists have
divided the Pied Wagtails into so many different races that I hesitate
to identify them. A bird that I was very glad to see was the Kite.
One evening we counted more than a dozen sailing gracefully over the
little mountain town of Corte ; they remained for hours sailing on
outstretched pinions ; their long forked tails seemed to be on a pivot,
for while the bird seemed to be perfectly still hovering in the air, the
tail was moving from side to side all the time and sometimes seemed to
be almost at right angles to the body. I suppose we should see these
graceful birds in Britain and many others as well if it were not for the
wretch with the gun. Buzzards were not very common. I only saw
two and they were flying very low down over the fields, evidently
looking for food. Kestrels were very much in evidence, and were
much tamer than those in England. Evidently they are not persecuted

so much. Their favourite perch seems to be the telegraph wires by
the roadside.
Hooded Crows are very common, but they seem to be a different
race from those we see in England and France ; they are much lighter
in colour, and at a distance seem black and white. Indeed, my friend
often mistook them for Magpies. Round the sea coast they swarmed,
finding their food no doubt from the various mollusca thrown up by
the tide. With these Crows were often one or two Carrion Crows,
which seemed never to wander very far from the seashore. I have
just noticed in The Practical Handbook of British Birds that the Common
Hooded Crow is " replaced by another form in Corsica ".
Of wading birds and gulls we saw very little ; the Black-headed
and Herring Gulls were the only ones seen. I may mention here,
if it is not out of place, that while staying in the Maritime Alps in
France I saw several examples of that charming bird, the Wall Creeper,
flying about over the snow, the rich crimson of the wings making a
pleasing contrast with the white surface of the rocks. Surely these
little birds cannot be so very delicate to endure such cold.
This brings to a close the list of birds that I was able to identify.
There were many more seen, but, as I have stated before, having no
glasses and an uninterested friend, I was unable to devote much time
to watching the birds, but some time in the future I hope to visit
Corsica again and to spend a longer and a more profitable time amongst
the birds, not with the object of collecting sub-species, but to get
a glance at their lives and not to take those lives on the mere excuse
of benefiting science. Do we not get infinitely more pleasure studying
these feathered jewels in their own sittings than comparing musty
skins ? Have we gained much knowledge in comparison to the
thousands and thousands of lives that have been taken to supply our
collectors' cabinets and museums ? I venture to say no. But I have
wandered off my subject. Corsica is surely one of the most fascinating
places for the bird-lover, for there so many different kinds of birds are
found, and yet it is so near England. It was winter time when I was
there, and at a time no doubt when the bird population was at its
lowest. What must it be like in the summer, when all the gorgeous
migrants come from the South % What a vast field of study for the

ANOTHER MEDAL FOR BREEDING RARE BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998883" page_id="32670624"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
In the January number of VOiseau the following note appears.
The larger of the two medals, it will be observed, may be won by
aviculturists in any European country.
"In addition to the awards which the Societe Nationale d'Acclimata-
tion already bestows annually for work appertaining to ornithology
and aviculture, a medal (large size) may henceforth be won by anyone
succeeding in rearing in Europe a species of bird or a hybrid bird
which has not previously been reared in captivity. A medal (small
size) may also be bestowed on the breeder who shall rear, under the
same conditions, the first bird, or hybrid bird, in France. These medals
will be awarded by the Award Committee of the Society. On every
medal the name of the breeder and of the bird will be inscribed. Anyone
desiring to compete must send to the president of the ornithological
section, within a period of approximately two months of the birth of
the bird, a detailed report, which will be published in VOiseau. The
report must give a complete description of the nest, the eggs, and the
chicks. All proofs, and any possible details which might be inquired
into, should be given. The young bird will be considered reared when
it is in a position to feed itself without the help of the parents. The
birds bred must be the property of the breeder, who may, however,
cede his rights to the award to the person who controls his breeding-
establishment.
" The medals will be awarded as soon after the receipt of the report
as possible ; they will be distributed at a special award meeting. In
all cases the Award Committee wil] be the only judges as to whether
a medal should in any particular case be awarded or not, and their
decisions must be regarded as final."

Australian Birds. -- It is doubtful whether aviculturists will avail
themselves to any extent of the offer of Australian birds made by the
Australian Zoological Control Board, for the prices asked are, to say
the least of it, high. It appears that a few persons have been entrusted
by the Government with the whole of the wild animal trade of Australia,
and they have been thus enabled to corner the market. Nothing must
be sold out of the country except by them, and they can charge what
prices they like. Moreover, the prices asked are for the stock on board
ship in Australia, the purchaser to take all the risk on the voyage and to
pay the freight. Thus, for a pair of newly caught White Cockatoos,
birds which are regarded as vermin in wheat-growing districts, and are
worth no more than #5 or #6 a pair in England, we are asked to pay
#6 before the specimens have started on their voyage. Very few
aviculturists will buy birds under these conditions, and if the Control
Board wishes to do business they must send a consignment in charge
of a qualified attendant, to be sold here for what they will fetch.
South African Birds. --Messrs. Gamage have been receiving
collections of South African birds lately, and several rarities have been
offered at prices which in these days are not excessive. On a recent
visit I noticed a cage containing a number of Pied Starlings (Spreo
licolor), a brown and ivhite bird with a very conspicuous whitish yellow
iris and yellow base to the otherwise black bill. The species has never
before been imported so far as I am aware, although it is abundant
in many parts of South Africa. Another cage contained some six or
seven Amethyst Starlings (Pliolidaiujes l. verreauxi), of which I wrote
in these notes last month. There was one fine example of the splendid
Black-collared Barbet (Lybius torquatus), two Levaillant's Barbets, and
a large number of Bed-collared and Bed-shouldered Whydahs.
Young Kagu. -- Mr. Heumann sends me further information about
his young Kagu, which he says is now as big as its parents and quite
able to take care of itself. The parents, he says, " are teaching it to
sing out in the mornings, which is very funny, as its voice is cracking."
One envies Australian aviculturists their splendid climate, where the
breeding of foreign birds seems to be a much easier matter than it is

such as Parrot Finches, Cordon Bleus, Lark Finches, Crested Cardinals,
and nearly all the Australian Finches, and many others."
A New Book on Australian Birds. -- Messrs. H. F. &amp; G. Witherby
announce the publication immediately of volume i of A Manual of

of Australia. It contains about 300 pages, and is illustrated with ten
coloured and thirty-six monochrome plates, and the price is #3 3s.
per volume. Volume i deals with the Orders Casuarii and Columb^:.
Mandarin Ducks and Japanese Teal.-- During the past few
weeks both Mandarin Ducks and Japanese Teal have been imported
and offered at a reasonable price. These are wild caught birds and
unpinioned and a very valuable addition to the ornamental waterfowl
in this country, as none had been imported since pre-War days, and
stocks which have not died out altogether or been disposed of on account
of the impossibility of providing food during the period of food-shortage
have become in-bred. Moreover, these species are two of the most
beautiful of the ornamental ducks.
Carolina Ducks.- -- Perhaps the most beautiful of all the ornamental
waterfowl is the Carolina, or Wood Duck, of North America. The War
has reduced its numbers in Europe in the same way as it has affected
all captive birds that were not considered useful as food-providers,
and it is not easy to obtain these birds now. In America, their habitat,
they had been nearly exterminated when the Bird Protection laws saved
them, and in parts the species is slowly recovering. But they will
never again be imported, and we must rely upon those bred in Europe
to keep up the stock in this country. Fortunately the species was well
established in Europe before the War, and probably it may be
obtainable on the Continent. I do not know what has happened to the
large numbers that formerly frequented the Berlin Zoological Gardens,
where they were full-wingecl and bred freely in nest-boxes and natural
hollows in the trees.

lot they make. The finest lot was received in November from that
well-known collector Mr. E. S. Joseph, and included species from
every part of Australia, as well as from Tasmania, New Zealand,
New Guinea, New Caledonia, and the Caroline Islands. Shipping
difficulties had prevented transportation since 1917, so that the
accumulation of several years was ready when space finally became
available, and the collection is the finest that has been received in
America for many years. Thirty-five species had never before been
represented in the Zoological Park, and several were quite new to
aviculture. The birds received include a pair of Prince Rudolph's
Bird of Paradise (Paradisornis rudolfi), the beautiful blue bird from
the Owen Stanley Mountains in South-East New Guinea, three Six-
plurned Birds of Paradise (Parotia sefilata), two Rifle-birds, and a green
Manucode. Alexandra and Turquoisine Parakeets arrived, the former
having been thought to be extinct. Iveas and the rare Kaka came from
New Zealand, while the collection of Pigeons included the very rare
White-fronted Bronze-wing (Henicophaps albifrons) from New Guinea.
Mr. Joseph. -- It is to be hoped that before long Mr. Joseph will
favour this country with a visit and bring with him a collection such
as he has recently conveyed to America. He is described as " tall in
statue, big in heart, a marvellous engine of energy, intelligent, fair and
square". He is said to possess an "almost fanatical devotion to
the pursuit and care of zoological rarities He had in his possession
in Australia a living Duck-billed Platypus, which he was about to
take with him to the States, but the New South Wales Government
prevented its leaving. " Mr. Joseph is 48 years of age, stands 6 feet in
height, and weighs 275 lb. He is at home everywhere in the Southern
half of Africa, in Australia, New Zealand, England, America, Panama,
and the Pacific Islands. He handles all kinds of wild beasts and great
snakes, and he is as proud of a feather-tailed marsupial opossum as
some collectors are of elephants. To see him reach into a crate,
seize a big kangaroo by the tail, drag it forth struggling and kicking and
hold it up in mid-air for your admiration, is a daily incident possible
only to him."

A Practical Handbook of British Birds. Pt. x, vol. ii, pp. 81-176.
Witherby &amp; Co., 326 High Holborn, W.C. 1. Price 46&apos;. 6rf. net.
We are favoured with a copy of part x of this excellent publication,
which is to be completed in eighteen parts, and will form by far the
most up-to-date and practical handbook of the day on British birds.
The subject has been treated of extensively and books on British
birds are numerous, but there are very few that one can name as being
absolutely reliable and free from the common fault of copying from
previous authors. Saunders' Manual was the best book of its day,
and at the present time we know of no other that excels it in usefulness
and reliability ; but the last edition appeared in 1899, since which
date not only has much been added to our knowledge regarding the
various local races of species, but the habits of certain species have
somewhat changed, their range extended or decreased, and it was
quite time that another work by the best authorities on the subject
was produced. We are glad that this present production is not the
work of one author alone, for no one person can know all there is to
know on so large a subject even as that of British birds, for the term
includes every species which at any time visits this country. The
present book has been divided into sections, and these have been placed
in charge of the following six authors, each of whom is an authority
on one or more particular group : Dr. E. Hartert, Miss Annie C. Jackson,
Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain, Mr. C. Oldham, Dr. N. F. Ticehurst, and
Mr. H. F. Witherby.
The form of the work is eminently practical, and under the name
of the species we find a full description, both of the adult male, adult
female, nestling, juvenile plumage (in some cases both of the male
and female), winter and summer plumage, measurements, characters,
and allied forms, field characters, breeding habits, food and distribution,
both in the British Isles and abroad.
The part before us deals with the birds of prey, and contains many
excellent figures of a particularly useful kind, showing the difference
between allied forms or species. Thus, on page 131, we have outlines
of the bills and middle toes of the Golden and Sea Eagles, showing at

Sirs,-- Could you tell me whether the Tanager described below is an
Olive Tanager or a Blue Tanager ? The whole plumage except the
wings and tail is lavender grey, the wings and tail are glossy light-
bluish green, the wing coverts are not the same shining blue as in the
Blue Tanager.

[There are several species of the bluish-grey Tanagers which are
closely allied, and it is difficult to say to which the bird referred to
belongs without close inspection. Tanagra episcopus has the lesser
wing-coverts whitish, while these are more bluish in T. collestis, bright
blue in T. ccina and T. cyanoptera, and violet in T. sclateri. -- D. S.-S.]

<bodyText confidence="0.993296533333333" page_id="32670629"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- I have recently had several small Glossy Starlings
(Lanyrocolius ) which I do not remember possessing before. They are
the smallest I have ever had, and at first, without reference, I thought
they were L. chalcuru-s. As far as one can possibly describe changeable-
hued birds of this kind, the salient features are small size, prevailing
shining golden green plumage, noticeably dork patch surrounding eye
and ear coverts and rump feathers exactly same colour as mantle and
back. The upper appearance of tail rich peacock copper green. Irides
same rich yellow as in the Purple-headed Glossy Starling, L. purpureus,
a bird almost twice as large. They are an interesting change from
L. chalyheus, the so-called Green Glossy Starling. The outline of bill
and head is much more curved in this small species than in L. chalyheus.
I should be glad to know whether my identification is correct, as I am
only able to refer to a B.M.C. and not a set of skins. All aviculturists
must welcome the reappearance of the Red-billed Liothrix on the

market. I was fortunate in getting several genuine males from one
dealer and several females from another for males. Although males
in full plumage are usually larger, more handsome, and more brilliant
on the ear-patch, breast-patch, and flight feathers than females,
immature birds are difficult to sex when dirty. I have, however, never
heard an adult female sing the rich sustained Black-cap song of the
male, and have never heard a male call in the high-pitched voice of the
female. Cocks caged in pairs, when in high condition, fight brutally,
and cocks and hens when first introduced skirmish ; but once this is
over they usually hold up their heads for a tickling process which seems
to give them great pleasure. I was glad also to see again and have some
Red-breasted Marsh Birds ( Leistes superciliaris) and their counter-
parts, Military Troupials ( T. militaris). One bird appeared to be
T. defillippi, having a light streak at base of mandible in addition to
superciliary streak. Can anyone tell me whether a hen of T. militaris
ever has a bill as short and as stout as that of Leistes superciliaris, as
I have a bird which I take to be a large Leistes out of colour that was
sent me for a hen Military Troupial ? I think it must be over fifteen
years since I bought either of these birds alive, but I never remember
a hen Military Starling having a bill as thick as a Marsh Bird. When one
lives away from London it is very difficult to settle these points to one's
satisfaction.

Sirs, -- On January 10, 1921, the male in the London Gardens gave
an outburst of affection to the female, which was interesting to watch.
When she was standing quiet he kept walking from side to side, passing
in front of her each time, his neck fully erect with short beak resting
on throat feathers, and at intervals spreading out the tail and uttering
two distinct notes frequently -- a guttural " ka " and a sound best
described as a "musical gobble". The female frequently replied to
the latter ; but did not make a " ka " in reply to the male, although
she appeared to appreciate it, the scene lasting an hour.

Ruddy-headed ( rubidiceps ), Kelp ( antarctica )--the species of this note
is to my mind the most attractive ; the black on the wings and tail
(and to a lesser extent scattered spots on the back feathers, with
tinges on the forehead and part of the breast) contrast with the white
plumage; the red beak with tip black and red feet being also
ornamental, while the brown iris shows prominently.
Both sexes are large and thick-set, and the only difference in
plumage that I could discover was that the male had some dark purple
feathers at lower part of wing when closed.
Specimens seen have been from Peru and Argentina. Does the
species extend elsewhere, and is there anything characteristic or unusual
in its habits when wild ?
In addition to the two voices above mentioned both sexes squorked
later on like domestic British Geese.

QUAILS IN CONFLICT

<bodyText confidence="0.994909111111111" page_id="32670631"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --Whether any species fight frequently when wild seems to
me to be difficult to decide owing to their small size. It seemed to be,
therefore, worth recording that two female Indian Button Quail
(Turnix tanJd) fought (in the small bird-house of the Gardens) to a
fatal ending on December 24,1920 (as you are probably already aware).
My attention was called by a visitor to the quarrel; and by the
time I arrived at the cage (being, when spoken to, at the further end
of the house) one bird was apparently already dead, because the other
was standing on it and pecking very vigorously at its rump area.
When the keeper got the body out there was a large superficial wound
there, which suggested that the conflict had been "short and hot '',
because there was no disturbance in the cage a few minutes before, I and
the keeper having both of us been there quite close. Probably heart
failure brought a sudden end to the fight. Apparently the victor was
still enraged even after we removed the corpse of its victim, judging
by the fact that a few minutes later I found it fighting with an Indian
Jungle Bush-Quail ( Pedicula asiatica) ; but it had to retreat speedily
before this larger opponent! Discretion was the better part of valour

here ! Having read with great interest the account of Quail breeding
in Japan (pp. 24-8) by Mr. N. Taka-Tsukasa, might I inquire of him
whether the birds there (apparently Coturnixjaponica, though no species
name given) quarrel when wild to his knowledge ?
Perhaps readers acquainted with Indian life could also give some
information as to pugnacious behaviour about the species above referred
to by me.
Frederick D. Welch, M.R.C.S.
March 4, 1921.
[Dr. Welch-was mistaken in his identification of the Quails, as the
only two examples of Turnix tanki in the Gardens of late were a true
pair of which the female died from egg-binding in February. Conflicts
between birds in the wild state are not common, because there is plenty
of space for all. --Ed.]

THE SONGS OF THE CIRL BUNTING AND LESSER WHITE-
THROAT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966000105263158" page_id="32670632"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --The songs and cries of birds and mammals have always
interested me, and on more than one occasion I have mentioned in
print the fact that the monotonous song of the Cirl Bunting is often
impossible to distinguish from that of the Lesser White-throat.
Several "closet naturalists" have shaken their heads over such
an assertion ; indeed, one of our popular catch-and-label-your-new-
sub-species school mocked at the very idea of anybody who professed
to know one British bird from another mistaking the song of the Cirl
Bunting for that of the Lesser White-throat.
Therefore, I was not a little uplifted to find to-day on reading
what Montagu, the first man to recognize the Cirl Bunting in this
country, had to say about this very point.
Perhaps you will allow me to quote his words from his famous
Dictionary of British Birds ? Of the Cirl Bunting he writes : " The
monotonous song of the male was incessant, shrill, and piercing ; so
much resembling the vociferous call notes of the Babillard, that it
requires considerable knowledge of their language not to mistake the
one for the other."

THE CEDAR WAXWING
( Ampelis cedrorum )

<bodyText confidence="0.998691727272727" page_id="32670639"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
There are three species of the genus Ampelis, the Waxwings, the
best-known being the Common or Bohemian Waxwing, A. garrulus,
which visits this country at irregular intervals, sometimes in considerable
numbers. Its habitat is the Arctic portions of both hemispheres.
The second species is the Cedar Waxwing, which occurs over the whole
of temperate North America, migrating south in winter to Guatemala
and the West Indies ; and the third is the Japanese Waxwing (A.
japonicus). All three species are very much alike in plumage, the
prevailing colour being soft reddish-brown, the head carrying an
erectile crest. The face is ornamented with black and the wings tipped
with yellow in A. garrulus and A. cedrorum, and red in A. japonicus.
In the Common Waxwing some of the secondary wing-feathers have
the shafts tipped with wax-like appendages, and in adult birds these
sometimes occur on the tail feathers as well. The Cedar Waxwing
has less of the red tips and the Japanese bird none at all.
The Cedar Waxwing is very rarely imported to Europe, but at the
present time a fine specimen is exhibited at the Zoological Gardens,
where it can readily be compared with the commoner species which
is also represented. It is a smaller bird, and in addition to the differences
mentioned above it will be observed that the flanks are yellowish-olive
instead of brownish-grey and the under tail-coverts are white instead
of chestnut as in A. garrulus.

In his letter published in the last November number of this journal
Mr. Barnby Smith describes a nest of this species which he saw in
a British Columbia apple-orchard in which the material used was
string. As a rule, the materials employed are twigs and rootlets, the
structure being lined with feathers. Soon after Mr. Barnby Smith's
visit to Canada I received a letter from his nephew, Mr. Vernon Darney,
enclosing the photographs, which are herewith reproduced, of the
Cedar Waxwing with its young. He wrote from Walhachin, B.C.:
" My uncle, Mr. Barnby Smith, has just been out here en route for New
Zealand, and while he was here I introduced him to a man who is very
keenly interested in all wild life. Among other things he showed us were
photos of a Cedar Waxwing and young. My uncle asked me to obtain
copies and send them to you, as they might interest some of the readers
of the Avicultural Magazine. They were taken by Mr. John M. Schreck
in an apricot orchard at Naramata, British Columbia, in 1911.
Naramata is in the famous fruit-growing district of the Okanagan."
The food of Waxwings consists of insects and berries, and they are
not difficult to keep in captivity providing their diet is not of too
fattening a nature. They are very fond of soaked dried currants,
and these seem to be a very wholesome food with the addition of a small
quantity of good insectivorous food.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
For many years it has been one of my avicultural ambitions to
possess a tame Pearl-spotted Owlet (Glauciclium perlatum). Ever since
I made the acquaintance of a charming specimen at the Zoological
Gardens I have hoped to receive an offer of one from a dealer, but it
was not until last summer that my hopes were realized in a letter from
Gamage's,only to be dashed a day or two later by another letter in which
they said that they found that the birds were really Pigmy Owls. Being at
that time under the impression that the Pigmy Owl was a very different
bird from the Pearl-spotted, I wrote back that I did not want them and
one was sold not long afterwards. Happening to call at Gamage's on

The Marquess of Tavistock--My Pigmy Owl 51
my next visit to London, I saw the other little fellow, and at once
realized that he was sufficiently like my favourite to be worth buying,
although he looked dirty and woebegone. A few days later he arrived,
very sorry for himself and with one eye closed--a common habit with
owls when feeling out of sorts which leads the inexperienced to suspect
an injury. After a night's rest and a good meal of sparrow, " Owlikins "
seemed much more lively--he was an adult bird and untamed, except
in so far as his travels had accustomed him to the sight of human beings.
On examining him carefully, however, I was very disappointed to find
that his beak had been severely injured, apparently by thebite of another
bird ; the upper mandible was nearly bitten through at the base and
much twisted, and a large piece of one nostril was entirely gone. Next
day the twisted mandible had been broken clean off, and I was afraid
I should have to destroy the poor little chap as it seemed hardly possible
he could feed. However, a little coaxing revealed the fact that he could
swallow pieces of food put into his mouth, and later I found out that
with the aid of his claws he could feed himself on chopped-up food,
though he was quite unable to tear skin or bones. The most annoying
result of his mutilation is his inability to keep his feathers clean,
necessitating assistance from me which is much resented. So far I
have been unable to induce him to take any kind of bath. Little Owls
very seldom bathe, but they love an occasional sprinkling, with water
or exposure to a shower of rain ; Owlikins hates being sprinkled, and
was so miserable after a forcible wetting I once gave him that I was
quite afraid he would die. I have never seen him drink, although I should
not like to say he never does so ; Little Owls drink sparingly when
adult, but, according to my experience, not at all for the first few months
of their existence. For some months I had very little time to devote
to Owlikins, and could not let him out of his cage. Before long, however,
he would jump on to my knee for food with a little coaxing, and allow
me to stroke his head. He is as diurnal in his habits as a Little Owl,
and like all " haggards " of that species I have tamed, exceedingly
gentle, never showing the smallest sign of temper as hand-reared birds
will sometimes do. As compared with a Little Owl he appears to possess
a very limited vocabulary. So far I have only heard him utter a clear
musical whistle, usually about dawn, and a finch-like cheep, which

The Marquess of Tavistock -- My Pigmy Old
appears to correspond to the low, harsh noise a Little Owl makes
when hungry or desiring to attract the attention of his friends.
Since being away on a holiday I have had more time to devote to
Owlikins, and he is getting steadily tamer. He likes me best, but is
less desperately shy of strangers than the Little Owls I have kept. He
shows remarkably little fear of my small son, aged 3, in spite of
his noisy ways, apparently considering that he is both young and
harmless ! Owlikins is let out in the room every evening ; he is not
very active, spending most of his time on two different chairs, and not
exploring every corner, after the inquisitive habit of a Little Owl.
He is, however, much less troublesome to recapture than other half-
tame owls I have had, and does not dash into inaccessible corners,
a little coaxing and gentle driving being all that is required to induce
him to return to his cage. If approached when out in the room by
someone he is rather afraid of he seldonis flies away, but tightens up
all his feathers and remains motionless until the danger is past. He is
also not at all ready to fly off when I go near him while he has food in
his claws ; if he were a trained hawk he would be commendably free
from the vice of carrying.
Mealworms are his favourite food,andhe requiresagood manyto keep
him in health. He catches them in his claws with great quickness, but
the subsequent transfer to his mouth is a matter of difficulty. He
prefers mice to small birds, and will eat small earthworms readily,
but does not care about big ones.
The other night for the first- time I saw him attempt to play, Little Owl
fashion, by pouncing on the chair cover and worrying it, but his missing
upper mandible will, I fear, prevent him from getting much fun in
this way. He appears to be moulting at present, for although I have
seen few dropped feathers in his cage, he has a lot of quills showing.
I rather fear that Owlikins may not live to a great age, but I hope to
keep him in health and happiness for a time, at any rate, in spite of
his infirmity. Had it not been for his unlucky accident I feel sure he
would have turned out an ideal pet, and even as he is he is a dear little
chap, sitting by me as I write, a tiny ball of fluffy feathers surmounted
by a bright, serious, little round face.

A VISIT TO THE BRINSOP COURT AVIARIES
By G. H. Gukney, F.Z.S.
Having lately spent a week-end in Herefordshire as the guest of
Mr. H. D. Astley, some account of his wonderful collection of birds,
which he keeps at his beautiful home at Brinsop Court, will, I am
sure, interest those readers of the Avicultwral Magazine who have not
been lucky enough to have had the opportunity of seeing the treasures
he has there.
To begin with, the beautiful old house, part of it twelfth century,
is filled with treasures not only ornithological, but also with its
associations with Wordsworth, and its lovely old galleries and halls
make it a place of great delight apart from the birds. The moat
which surrounds the house and the gardens of great picturesqueness
and fascination add to its beauty, which is further emphasized by the
Stanley Cranes, which are full winged, or by the Flamingoes, which
always appear to group themselves in positions in which their beauty
shows off to perfection, either reflected in the moat or standing in some
corner amongst surroundings which add enormously to their own
beauty. The Stanley Cranes generally take an early morning fly round
the place, and to see them come sailing over the roof of the house
and then settling is a wonderful sight; they are perfectly tame, and
although all Mr. Astley's birds were in beautiful order I do not think
I have ever seen two birds in such faultless condition and bloom as
these two Stanleys were.
Amongst so many birds it is difficult to know which to specially
mention, when all deserve a word. On going down to breakfast the
first morning I was greeted by a Missel Thrush which has the run of
the dining-hall and flew screeching at me as I entered the room,
pecking me quite severely on the forehead, knowing perfectly well
I was a stranger. Recovering from this somewhat boisterous greeting
I at once went to look at some of the avian treasures in cages in the room.
Here, in a large wooden cage, Mr. Astley keeps his unique Woodpecker,
the Golden Naped Woodpecker from the Himalayas ; it is frightfully
rare, and those of us who have kept woodpeckers know what difficult

birds they are to deal with satisfactorily, but this bird, which I think
Mr. Astley has had for considerably over a year, looked the picture of
health ; it was about the size of a Green Woodpecker, perhaps rather
smaller, and beautifully marked with yellow ; quite tame, and if one
put one's hand near the bars of the cage, its long pink tongue would
dart out and vibrate up and down one's finger with great rapidity,
being specially attracted by the glitter of my gold signet ring. In
this room also are a pair of Purple Sugar Birds, a Shama, and a lovely
Chestnut-breasted Blue Niltava. Down a passage is the bird-room,
a good-sized room, the walls lined with white china tiles ; here, flying
loose, are the pair of Cat Birds, most interesting and fairly tame; they
are rather heavy-looking birds, but very attractive and of course
extremely rare. I was pleased to see two Black-winged White Grackles ;
I kept this very handsome Starling before the War, and found them
most charming birds, with their black and white plumage and bright
yellow legs and bill. Three Queen Alexandra Parrakeets, a Black-
capped Lory, some Blue Budgerigars, and last, but by no means least,
a most beautiful Mot-mot, made up the inhabitants of the bird-room.
The Mot-mot, with its curious racket tail, was not loose, but in a cage ;
he was quite tame and the picture of health. In Mr. Astley's study
were four Nightingales, three of them&apos; anyhow singing beautifully ;
here also was a rare Kobin Chat (Cossypha caffra), a North American
Wood Thrush, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, and a White-winged Mocking
Bird. Other birds noticed in various parts of the house were Liothrix,
two rare Mocking Birds (Mimus gilvus), Hooded Siskins, Mexican Red
Cardinal, Yucatan Blue Pie, and various others which I have forgotten.
The evening I arrived at Brinsop there was great excitement, for
the pair of Hokis, or Eared Pheasants, which are quite full-winged
and have the run of the garden, had gone off and after much difficulty
had been located in a large wood on the side of a hill some mile away
from the house ; however, later in the evening Mr. Astley's bird-man
reported that they had been found, and had either been driven or came
back, and he told me the following morning that they had flown down
the hill-side at the most terrific pace, far faster than partridges. They
appeared to be none the worse for their adventure, and were most
attractive looking birds, I thought, with their ear tufts and odd tails,

and on the Sunday evening I saw them roosting on their accustomed
bough at the top of a tall Scotch fir in the garden.
Iir the Paddocks besides the Stanley Cranes were four Manchurian
Cranes, as well as White-necked and Australian. The large pond
beyond the moat held a varied collection of Ducks; most of the
commoner species were represented and I also noticed Scaup, Red-
crested Pochard, Chiloe Wigeon, Falcated Duck, G-olden-eye, White-
eyed Pochard, and the extremely rare and beautiful little Cotton Teal,
of which there were three or four (I forget) lovely examples swimming
about, rather apart from the commoner herd, as though they knew
their superiority. The geese included Canadian, Bernicle, Ross' Snow
Goose, Bar-headed, Ruddy-headed, Magellanic, and Grey Lag.
The large series of beautifully arranged and thought-out aviaries
contained a wonderful collection of various birds. I have jotted down
the names of a good many, but the following is a very incomplete list;
the birds I can remember included Barraband Parrakeets, Red Rumps,
Siamese Fire Backs, a pair of Satyr Tragopans, White-crested Jay
Thrush, every shade of Blue, Green, and Yellow Budgerigars, Black-
headed Caiques, King Parrot, Stanley and Queen Alexandra's

Doves, and some Bleeding-heart Pigeons. While sitting on a seat outside
the aviary with Mrs. Astley a perfectly delightful pair came walking up,
one on each side, a Guan and a Trumpeter ; the former hopped on to
the back of the seat, andbegan to amuse himself by pecking Mrs.Astley's
hat; the Trumpeter, not to be outdone, essayed to jump into her lap,
but that was already occupied by a Pekinese Spaniel, so he had to be
content with standing oil the seat and pulling her jacket with his beak.
A few yards away on a heap of hay, against a sunny wall, basked a pair
of little Duiker Antelopes, a very difficult animal to keep in confinement,
while before long the two Holds walked up and flying up on to the back
of the seat demanded attention. It was all a wonderful picture, and

after breaking the tenth commandment many times, I reluctantly
tore myself away from these fascinating aviaries to return to the house,
passing on the way another aviary in which I noticed Golden Pheasants,
a Siamese Fire Back, and three fine Monauls. Too quickly Monday
morning came, and I had to leave hospitable Brinsop and its many
delights, and as I drove through the fore-court and over the moat,
I turned back to see the last of the lovely old house and the pink of the
Flamingoes as they stood motionless in the water, and thought of the
Queen of Sheba after her visit to King Solomon, who returned to her
own home with no heart left in her.

By Frederick D. Welch
A relative of mine used to keep a Blue-fronted Amazon, which
I frequently saw between 1890 and 1910, which shows that this species
will live at least twenty years and probably very much longer,
a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo having lived ninety odd years, so I was
informed in 1901 by a patient in Maidstone about one at his house.
This Amazon used to perform some amusing antics, of which readers
of the Avicultural Magazine may like to hear.
The shutters in the dining-room used to be closed by a handle,
which being turned slid them out, so to speak, from an excavation
within the wall, and were made with a mirror on their inner sides,
which reflected things in the room. The Amazon used to be let out
of its cage most evenings for exercise, its favourite method of
locomotion being to walk backwards along the floor, and when it saw
the reflection of itself in the mirror-windows it used during the end
of December and first half of January to advance with an excited
chuckle and begin moving much like the action of a dove in courting.
This chuckling was made in quite a soft voice, and was never made,
to my knowledge, except during those months. It seemed to me to
be undoubtedly a display of breeding affection. There was nothing
known for certainty about the bird's history previous to its arrival at

F. D. Welch--An Amusing Amazon, and also a Parrakeet 57
my relatives, which I understood to have been many years before it
was first seen by me ; but it seemed to me as the most likely explanation
that it had been captured when quite a nestling, and therefore never
remembered distinctly seeing others of its own species, in which case
it seemed to me the sexual affection would be more shown than with
Amazons which see each other frequently.
Be this as it may, it was an interesting scene to watch, and usually
continued for about a minute, at the end of which time it apparently
dawned on the Amazon's brain that the supposed companion was not
inclined for flirtation, as it usually left the window suddenly and resumed
its walks in no very amiable mind towards human beings for a while !
The only other of the tribe which it saw during its life there was a Ring-
necked Parrakeet (Palceornis torquata), with which it was not on friendly
terms, so the two were never let out of their cages at the same time. The
Parrakeet was, by the way, a remarkably distinct talker and mimic,
calling " Puss, puss, puss " so as to deceive the kitchen cat, which
thought (as I saw myself) it was the cook calling for it to give it food ;
and it also frequently deceived a maid called " Sarah " by calling her
when she had left the room where it used to live.
The Amazon, on the other hand, used only to call in a monotonous
bass voice at sunset regularly, and occasionally in early morning as
well. When out of its cage it used to frequently enter beneath the
grate, where a fire was burning at the time, and pull out bits of cinder
and eat them, which I suppose acted in a similar way to the small
stones eaten by domestic fowls and others of that order.
It would not, however, take any notice of cinders taken out for it
by myself or others in the house, but ignored such with contempt!
It was a wonder that the bird never got its plumage damaged by hot
cinders falling from the fire above it, and it dodged in an out from the
grate in a most skilful way.
I may add, in conclusion, that the Amazon and Parrakeet above
mentioned were regularly watered from overhead with a watering-can
and fine-rosed nozzle in hot weather with ordinary tap-water, and left
in sunshine out of doors to dry, care being taken, of course, to avoid
draught.

(Cinnyris gutturalis)
A specimen of this fine Sunbird lias been presented to the Zoological
Society by its corresponding member, Mr. Harold Miller, the Director
of the Durban Zoological Gardens, and is the first example the Society
has received. It is a splendid species, with the head and body velvety
black shaded with brown, the forehead and cheeks glossed with metallic
green, the throat and chest scarlet, the feathers with a subterminal
bar of metallic blue showing as minute spots. The species occurs in
East, South-East, and South-West Africa.
Capt. Shelley, in his Birds of Africa, gives a long account of the
habits of this species from the pen of the late Capt. Boyd Alexander,
who tells us that " When not breeding, the males generally travel from
one spot to another without the company of the females. During the
heat of the day, when all other birds have hidden themselves in the
depths of the wood, they are abroad, seeming to take a delight in the
intense heat, always most active, while it is only in the early morning
and evening that they take a rest from their labours and retire into the
thick under-cover. As the pairing season approaches, the male never
leaves the side of his mate, and when courting her has a quaint way of
swaying his body from side to side as if it was on a pivot right in front
of his gaze. Moreover, he is constantly singing to her, uttering his
song from the topmost twig of some tall acacia tree, while the notes
both in tone and rendering are by no means unpleasant, and closely
resemble those of the Lesser Redpoll ".
A nest found by Boyd Alexander was oval-shaped and attached to
three slender branches of an acacia tree, and about 20 feet up. It
was flimsy and untidy, made of fine grass interwoven with fragments of
skeleton leaves, cobwebs, and cocoons, and lined with fluffy down.
Near the nest was a nest of bees, which the birds made use of to guide
them to some rich flower store in the vicinity.
An examination of a series of these birds convinced Boyd Alexander
that the full plumage of the adult is not assumed until the second year.

About 18,000 Parrots and Finches of species frequenting the northern
parts of Australia were recently taken into Brisbane Harbour on board
a steamer bound for Sydney. Much concern was manifested by the
owners of the birds, when shortly after the steamer berthed, honorary
officers of the Queensland Agricultural Department and the bird
protection societies attended with a police sergeant, and the latter
announced his intention of releasing the birds, trade in which is
forbidden under the Queensland law. Permits from Northern Territory
officials were produced bv the bird-catchers, whereupon the matter
threatened to develop into a clash between Federal and State
authorities. However, the police arrived at the conclusion that their
powers did not extend to the birds on the boat, and they did no more
than place a guard to ensure that none of the Finches disembarked
locally. Such of the birds as were intended for Brisbane were not
landed. The whole a vine cargo went on to Sydney, where the birds
sold readily at prices ranging from 20s. to 50s. a dozen.

worst for many years. One of the most interesting aviaries in the
Zoological Gardens is the Summer Aviary, so called because it is the
summer home of many of the birds which winter in the Bird House and
Western Aviary. With the first fine days of April many of the hardier
birds are transferred to this enclosure and seem at once to realize that
they have arrived at their summer quarters, and that it is time to turn
their thoughts to nest-building.
The Summer Aviary. --The Zoological Society is fortunate in
possessing two good pairs of American Blue-birds, a species that was
well known to aviculturists in the old days before the export of American
birds was prohibited. These have been placed in the Summer Aviary,
one pair in each of the two compartments, and it was a pleasure to
watch them when first liberated. The cocks commenced to sing and
spread their wings and tails, and to inspect every box for a suitable
site for a nest. Virginian Cardinals, Song Sparrows, and several others
were busy building their nests in less than a week after being put into
the aviary.
King Vultures. --An interesting addition to the collection at the
Zoo consists of a couple of King Vultures, a species that has been
unrepresented for some few years past. This is the only species of
Vulture that is really brightly coloured when adult, the sexes being
alike, of a rosy cream colour, with a grey neck-ruff, black wings and
tail, and the head ornamented with bright orange and red. One of the
two new arrivals is immature, and is of a uniform blackish-brown colour,
a stage that I, at least, had never before seen. It will be interesting to
watch the gradual change to the adult coloration.
Japanese Teal. --Japanese Teal have been arriving in some numbers
and the dealers are offering them at a very reasonable price. These
are some of the most beautiful of the ornamental waterfowl, but they
are very wild when first imported and unless carefully enclosed with
wire-netting will stray away to a certainty. They have been bred
successfully on several occasions in this country, but they must have
plenty of space. At the Zoo, in the breeding season, pairs will wander
up and down by the wire fencing in their endeavours to go further

afield in search of a nesting site. Only once have eggs been laid, in
a nest close to the fence, and as far from the pond as the birds could go.
A Curious Grey Parrot.-- I hear that Mr. Delacour has obtained
a very curious and rare variety of the Grey Parrot, in which the whole
of the plumage is pink, with the exception of a few feathers in the body
and the quills, which are of the normal grey colour.
Colour Varieties of the Budgerigar. --Colour varieties in
birds are always interesting, and occasionally they are more beautiful
than the normal state. In the Budgerigar, for instance, the blue variety
is extremely beautiful, and it is very satisfactory to know that this race
has not died out as was at one time feared that it might on account of
the War. Two or three of our members have stocks which they are
doing their best to increase. There are now three distinct varieties,
the well-known yellow, the blue, and the olive. Mr. Astley bred a white
bird, which most unfortunately died. He kindly sent me the dead
bird, which I was very glad to add to my collection of skin specimens.
Comparing a series from the normal green bird to the white one
finds that the colour in the former is composed of yellow and blue, the
former a pigment, the latter being produced by feather-structure,
combined with black pigment. In the yellow variety the black pigment
has disappeared ; in the blue variety the yellow pigment is absent.
Mr. Astley's bird is not a true albino, as it had dark eyes. It is a very
washed-out blue, still showing faint traces of blue on the rump. The
yellow pigment has entirely gone, as in the typical blue, and the black
pigment is only present to a very small extent.
A Splendid Peregrine.-- The Zoological Society has received as
a present from Major W. H. Rawnsley an extremely fine female
Peregrine Falcon in most faultless condition. The letter accom-
panying the bird states that " she was caught on a trawler off Iceland
in a fog in October, 1920, and fed on fish from the time she was caught
till purchased in Aberdeen a week or so after landing. She is very tame
in the sense of not being frightened at people, but she is too vicious to
train. She eats off her jesses at once, and fights like mad when we try
to hood her. She will fly to the hand for food."

A New Waders' Aviary. -- The Waders' Aviary at the Zoological
Gardens came in the way of certain alterations that were necessary,
and it was decided that it should be taken down and re-erected on
another site between the Lion House and the Cattle-sheds. This work
has now been completed, and in many ways the new aviary is better
than the old. The aspect is better, the inmates getting the benefit
of more sun than formerly. In the old position the birds had to be
viewed against the light, the front of the aviary facing north, whereas
now the north end is planted up with ornamental shrubs and an
excellent view is obtained from the other three sides.

Sirs, -- As a general rule, when one has valuable birds which one
is most anxious to keep for many years they frequently die promptly ;
but when one has birds of little intrinsic value they continue in
boisterous health for an unconscionable time and therefore cost one at
least a hundred times their value in food.
As I mentioned some time ago I still have three finches remaining
from my former living collection of birds--a hen Napoleon Weaver
bought in 1900, a cock Chingolo Song-sparrow bred by Mr. Tesche-
maker in 1907, and a cock hybrid between Cherry-finch and Masked
Grass-finch bred by Mr. Sich in 1908.
All these birds are in perfect health and condition, and have never
had a day's illness, their chief interest consists in their longevity.
I always regarded the Weavers as hardy and long-lived birds, but
twenty-one years in captivity and still going strong seems remarkable
for so small a bird as a Napoleon Weaver.

A VISIT TO THE BIRDS AT THE
WELLINGTON ZOO
By C. Barnbv Smith.
I had an opportunity of visiting the Zoo at Wellington, New
Zealand, last February, and considering the institution has only been

in existence about twelve years, the collection of birds is most
satisfactory and interesting. The Zoo comprises some 17 |acres of
undulating v ground on the edge of the hills in the outskirts of the
city, and is fairly well screened from wind--a great point at
Wellington. The large pond for waterfowl would carry any number
of birds, and the Paradise Ducks, Japanese Teal, Maned Geese, etc.,
which I noticed looked very flourishing. More waterfowl, however,
are greatly wanted. By far the most interesting thing I saw was the
place where a pair of Mantell's Kiwis nested three years ago. These
birds were confined in a large wire enclosure on the hillside, the place
being fairly dense with trees and low bushes and having a little
watercourse running down the centre. The birds, unfortunately,
elected to make the nest in the bank of the stream at the lower end
of the enclosure. They burrowed a hole like a rabbit's hole,
extending some 18 inches into the bank at right angles to the stream,
and then the hole had an elbow-turn, and was carried on for another
2 feet. At the end the birds excavated a circular hole of considerable
size, which they carefully lined with leaves from lime-trees in the
enclosure. It seems that the female bird did most of the nest-making.
The hopes of Mr. Langridge, the Zoo Superintendent, were great for a

6-1 0. Barnby Smith--A Visit to the Birds at the Wellington Zoo
time, but unfortunately before any eggs were laid a heavy rain-storm
raised the water-level of the stream to such a height that it was
found necessary to dig into the nest from above to avoid the risk
of one or both the old birds being drowned. Both birds were in the
nest when it was dug out. Since then no further attempt at nesting
have been recorded, but as there are still Kiwis at the Zoo the future
is not without hope. Considering Kiwis are practically doomed to
extinction, further records as to their nesting operations are most
desirable.
Amongst other birds that have recently nested at the Zoo, with
more or less success, are Paradise Duck, American Wood Duck,
Weka Rails, Red-billed Gulls, Black-backed or Dominican Gulls,
Straw-necked Ibises, Magpie Larks, Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters,
and, of course, various small families.
I saw a very fine pair of Ostriches and a Cassowary which would
be a credit to any collection. I also noticed two White-fronted
Herons in splendid health, after two years in captivity. These birds
are incessantly picking up flies and other insects, and Mr. Langridge
attributes their good health greatly to this. In various aviaries he
hangs up meat to induce flies. A fine King Penguin and three
Sclater's Crested Penguins showed the usual inquisitiveness and
anxiety to be fed. A curious pied specimen of the Pectoral Rail
looked quite happy. If this could be got to breed there might
possibly be interesting results. Amongst Owls were the Australian
Barn Owl, a very fine specimen, the " Delicate Owl ", the " Spotted
Eagle Owl ", and, of course, the common NeAv Zealand " Morepork ",
which greatly resembles our Athene noctua.
The Parrots included Keas, Kakas, Cockatoos, Pennants, Rosellas,
Macaws, various small Parrakeets, and a splendid specimen of a
Tabuan Parrot from the Fiji Isles. I was disappointed not to see
either Kakapos or New Zealand Parrakeets. Both, however, are most
difficult to obtain, though further efforts to get them are being made.
Pheasants did not show any specially rare varieties, but included
a good cock Elliot's Pheasant, sent in mistake for a Jungle Fowl.
I noticed amongst the Lesser Waders a fine specimen of the Golden
Plover, which was just losing his full breeding plumage. This bird

E. G. B. Meade-Waldo--The European Sparrow Oivl 65
flew into the porthole of a ship 50 miles off the coast. At present
the Zoo does not hold any specimens of those interesting New
Zealand birds, the Stilts (either pied or black), but it is hoped to get
these in future as they are fairly common in many places. The
prospects of getting " Tuis " or Parson Birds are much more doubtful,
and the possibility of getting " Huias " almost nil.
A small flock of Apostle Birds (Struthidea cinerea) from Australia
seemed quite happy in an enclosure with other birds. They have
been in the Zoo some six years, and though popularly supposed to
be most pugnacious, yet in captivity have shown quite a peaceable
disposition. Their common name of Apostle Bird is gained from their
being usually found in flocks of twelve. It is interesting to note that
wild Fantails (that quaint lively little bird with at least nineteen
names) have repeatedly nested and reared young in the Zoo grounds.
The Zoo authorities are most anxious to enlarge their collection
of birds, and the New Zealand climate is such as to render easy the
keeping of many varieties, which in other places are only half-hardy.
There are, however, obvious difficulties in the way of speedy progress,
such as geographical situation, shortage of labour and lack of trans-
port facilities incidental to a newly developing community.
Members of the Avicultural Society and other enthusiasts having
surplus stock for disposal might do worse than arrange to send them
to the Wellington Zoo. The Superintendent would readily answer
all inquiries as to method of transit and otherwise ; also arrange
special terms with the shipping companies. Many New Zealanders
would like to see birds sent from the British Isles, to which they,
almost all of them, refer as " Home ".

Hugh Wormald -- Long-tailed Tits
get his Ural Owls, viz. East Prussia. She, for it was a female, lived with
us for three years in perfect health, and then escaped, and as she had
evidently been captured when adult, there is no doubt but that she found
little difficulty in getting her own living. In many ways this little owl
differed entirely from all the numerous species of owls which I have kept.
The peculiar whistle and chirp (to my ear musical) is most un-owl-like,
and is characteristic of the genus Glaucidium, as is also the peculiar
nianner in which the tail is elevated--you cannot say cocked up---
and swung from side to side--you cannot say wagged--when the bird
is in motion. I have not bred this owl, so cannot say how the adult
plumage is assumed, viz. if immediately after the first white down, or
if there is an intermediate down between the nestling white down and
the true feathers, or no, but I should be inclined to think that the
plumage is assumed as in the Scops Owl, without any intermediate
down. Perhaps Miss Chawner, who has successfully bred a kindred
species of the same genus can enlighten us. I find by my notes that
I considered this owl to be an insect and bird eater, in this case differing
from Lord Tavistock. Also she was a very large eater. I should think
in the northern forests and semi-Alpine forests in which it finds its
home that titmice very likely form a considerable part of its food.
Our bird was extremely fond of sunning itself and in taking a dust-
bath ; she also bathed and drank, but was not nearly so fond of a bath
as the generality of owls, which, with the exception of the Barn Owls
and Little Owls {Athene), are great washers. It was interesting to note
that when the tail was elevated the " hinge " seemed to be nearly in
the middle of its back, showing how much was " feather " and how
little owl !

The way in which the numbers of Long-tailed Tits have increased
in the last two years must be a matter for congratulation to every
naturalist, gardener, and fruit-grower. The winter of 1916-17 very
nearly exterminated them here in Norfolk, and their numbers remained
very small until last spring, when there was a perceptible increase of

birds, though I did not see a nest in 1920. I saw one or two family
parties which had not left the nest for more than a week or two. But
this spring just round here I know four nests, and several other pairs
of birds whose nests I have not found, so that in this locality, at any
rate, their numbers are up to the 1915 standard. I have always wanted
to know how long a time is occupied in building one of their wonderful
nests, and this year I was able to find out how long it took one pair
to build (I daresay the time taken by individual pairs varies). On
Saturday, 12th March, I happened to see a Long-tailed Tit fly into a low
rhododendron, it only remained there a second or two, but since where
birds are concerned I am of an inquisitive disposition, I was obliged
to go and look into the shrub, where, to my delight, I found a minute
piece of moss and lichen, obviously the first foundation of a nest.
Fortunately the site is only 2 ft. 6 in. or so from the ground on the
outside of an outside shrub of a large clump of rhododendrons, and
consequently easily watched. I noticed that when collecting material
the birds were frequently separated by some distance, but when feeding
only, and not actually building or collecting, were always together ;
also that they always fed on the same trees, i.e. two small clumps of
young larch. The nest progressed very slowly at first, three or four
days seeming to make no difference to it in size, although the birds
worked extraordinarily hard. What struck me as remarkable was that
I never saw either of the birds remain at the nest for more than two or
three seconds, and yet in that time they managed to get the material
woven in very tightly and neatly ; how they do it with their absurd
little beaks is amazing ! It was not till the nest had attained the size
of a Chaffinch's that it began to grow at all quickly ; at this point a
lot of very fine grass leaves were used in the inside, the outside being
composed of moss, lichen, and cobwebs. This was the fourteenth day,
and from now onwards the nest grew much more rapidly, until by
the eighteenth day from the outside the nest appeared finished. The
birds now began to bring feathers only, and must have brought
hundreds ! On the twenty-third day the nest was completed. The first
egg was laid on the twenty-fifth day, and from then onwards I never
saw the birds at all; they forsook my garden entirely, and I feared that
they had forsaken the nest, so on the evening, when there should have

been four eggs, I thought I'd put a finger in to see if everything was
all right. I chose the evening as I didn't expect the bird to be on the
nest at 5 p.m. However, as luck would have it, she was on, but
fortunately took no notice of being poked by my finger. I hurriedly
retreated a few yards to see if she would come off, but as she didn&apos;t
appear for ten minutes I concluded that she wasn't worried, and left
her. I didn't like to feel any more, for fear of making her forsake,
so I don't know how many eggs she laid, nor the exact day on which
she began to incubate. I didn't see either bird for about a fortnight,
until one evening when they both flew across the lawn into a birch-
tree near the house, obviously my pair as the hen's tail was very bent
from being twisted round in the nest. After this I saw them together
fairly frequently ; they were now using the garden again, but didn&apos;t
seem to have any fixed time for coming off the eggs to feed. On
29 th April I again felt in the nest, and found several very small birds
and could feel one or two eggs, but whether these were " clear " eggs or
have since hatched I don&apos;t know. The bird broods them a great deal,
but comes off if one walks by the nest; when she was incubating
she never stirred, even when one looked quite close at the nest. Some-
times one could see her face looking out half smothered in feathers,
but she always retreated and huddled down into the nest instead of
coming out of it. I expect the young birds to remain in the nest until
about the 16th of this month (May). When building the birds took no
notice of me at all. I used to sit on a bank about three yards from the
nest and watch them ; as long as one kept still they didn't worry.

In the course of 1920 I was lucky enough to procure six different
species of Barbets. I am particularly fond of this family of gorgeous
birds, whose peculiar shape and bright colours are often associated
with great tameness. Three of my Barbets come from Asia and three
from Africa. One knows that, besides these two continents, South
America also possesses Barbets. All are rather omnivorous, but Asiatic

birds are more fruit-eaters, African, and especially American, species
being more insectivorous.
My Asiatic Barbets are the Giant, the Hoary Jungle, and the
Common Bluethroated. Of the last bird, well known to all aviculturists,
I won't speak. The Hoary Jungle Barbet ( Thereiceryx zeylonicus ) is
an inhabitant of India and Ceylon ; his size is that of a Starling ; his
body is of a lovely pale green, head and neck grey streaked with white,
bill dark yellow, eyes with white " spectacles It is a bold and
unsociable bird that I keep alone in an aviary of the bird gallery, as
well as the Giant Barbet. The latter ( Megalcema virens ) is the biggest
bird of the family, and a very handsome one. Its size is that of a Jay ;
head and neck very dark bluish-green ; chest, dark brown ; tail and
wings, green ; shoulders, chestnut; underparts, green streaked with
pale yellow ; vent, rich pink. This bird inhabits China. Of the African
species, one is the well-known Levaillant's Barbet ( Trachyphonus
cafer), a beautiful bird with rather a long tail, a crest, and a fine plumage,
variegated with yellow, red, black, and white. The Black-collared
Barbet ( Lybius torquatus ) is also very handsome and rare. A few have
been imported lately, but when my bird arrived it was only the second
one ever imported into Europe, the first one having been brought into
Berlin in 1912. Its size is that of the Common Barbet; head
and neck, scarlet; wide, black collar ; back, olive green ; wings and
tail, black ; underparts, yellow. My last species is a little Pied Barbet
( Tricholcema leucomelan) of the size of a Sparrow, black and white,
with a scarlet and yellow patch on the head. All these African birds
are quite sociable and harmless, and live in the Bird Gallery with
Tanagers, Bulbuls, etc. I give all these Barbets insectile mixture ;
a little meat, fruit, such as apple, orange, bananas, elder-berries, etc.,
mashed potatoes and carrots and dried figs and raisins. I find them
very robust and most satisfactory aviary birds.
Two rather rare birds that I have kept and have proved a failure
are the Grey Touracou ( Schizorhis concolor ) and the Long-tailed Pied
Shrike ( Uroilestes melanoleuca) . Of the former species I received a
dozen specimens a year ago, with the result that, despite all cares, only
one is still living in my aviaries. I and Mine. Lecallier tried all sorts of
food and accommodations, and always, without any apparent reasons,

some of the birds became mute and died after a month&apos;s disease. The
bird I still have lives out of doors in the large aviary, where I keep my
Magpies, Jays, Toucans, Hornbills, etc., and is in perfect condition. I
shall add that these Grey Touracous are rather clumsy in their ways, and
not nearly so attractive as the green species.
Out of the four Long-tailed Pied Shrikes that I received, two died
quickly. The other two lived about a year, and I must confess that
I was pleased to see them go ! They should be quite nice in good
plumage, but they are so wild and restless, that they always damage
their feathers, even in a large aviary. I have not seen mine with their
long whydah-like tail more than a couple of months. And one never
knows how to keep them ; they seem very unhappy in a cage ; I tried
to put them in the Magpies' aviary, but they were bullied by them.
I put them with smaller birds, of their own size ; the Shrike killed
several of them. One should give them a large aviary to themselves,
and they are not worth it. They are not difficult on the food question,
being quite satisfied with Duquesne insectivorous food and meat.
About two years ago I received a consignment of five Cuban Trogons,
in miserable condition, in fact they were nothing but lumps of dirty
broken feathers. Three died shortly, but two recovered, moulted out,
and became the most charming birds one could wish to possess.
Unfortunately, one died of stoppage of the intestines from having
swallowed the hard skin of some coarse grape. With Trogons and
Birds of Paradise it is essential not to give them any chance of eating
hard food, as they invariably die when they eat it. My last Trogon
is in the best of health, and now moulting for the second time with me.
It is a very tame and sensible bird, with the most gorgeous green, pearl-
grey, white, black, and crimson dress.
My largest outdoor aviary, which connects with a heated room,
contains a fair number of Magpies, such as Acalie (Cyanocorax
chrysops), Blue ( C. cceruleus), San Blasian, Beechey's (Cissolopha
sanblasiana and C. beecheyi), Himalayan Blue (TJrocissa occipitalis),
Wandering Tree Pies (Dendrocitta rufa), African Black (Cryptorhina
afra) ; an Australian Piping Crow ; some Toucans and Hornbills, long-
tailed Glossy Starlings and Mexican Rails (Aramides albiventris) ; all
these birds agree very well together, and make a very good show.
There is never any fighting between them.

By E. Maud Knobel.
I have often been very much amused by other peoples' ideas and
opinions of birds, both as pets and in general. I remember some years
ago being introduced to a lady at an " at home ", and after a while
she asked what I was interested in. I replied that I went in for birds.
" Oh, yes," she said, " canaries." " No," I said, " not Canaries,
foreign birds." " Ah ! " she exclaimed, " Budgerigars." As I was
keeping a Shama, a superb Tanager, and a Bauer's Parrakeet, amongst
other things, at the time, and feeling not a little proud of them, I tried
to explain what they were, but her imagination had evidently never
penetrated beyond canaries and budgerigars, and she dismissed me as
a mild kind of lunatic.
Once down at the London Hospital, where for many years I was
a ward visitor, I remember one day talking to a patient, and had tried
many subjects, but had got no answers beyond yes and no. Then
I suddenly began talking about my Parrots. At this her whole face
lighted up, and she exclaimed, proudly, "Ah, I keep a Parrot." Oh,
I thought to myself, at last I have found something in common. So
delightedly I asked her what kind it was, a grey or a green. " Green,"
she said. " Does it talk," said I, " " Oh, no," she replied, " it is
under a glass case ! "
People have often asked me why I keep so many Parrots. Surely
they must all be alike. Well, are they ? I can honestly say that I have
never had two alike. They all have so much individual character.
There are dull ones, of course, and clever ones, tame ones, and savage
ones, but they are all different. For this paper I propose to pick out
the three Blue Fronted Amazons that I have at the present moment.
The first, erroneously named " Richard," for she is an old dame of
many years standing, was given to me in November, 1914, by friends
who had to part with her on account of the war. Personally, I far
prefer to buy my own birds and get them first hand. By that I mean
young birds freshly imported who have never known another mistress
that I can teach and bring up as I like. And yet it is not every bird

I want by a very long way ; it has to have something " special "
about it for me to want to possess it. However, at the beginning of the
war one could not look a gift horse in the mouth, so I gladly accepted
Richard. She is a pretty bird--at least, she has a very pretty head--
with a great deal of blue, and what yellow she has is under the chin.
She is small for a hen, and not a good shape, and her feathers have
rather a faded washed-out appearance. But then she is old, which
may account for want of colour. I should say she had been badly
treated in her youth, for even now, after nearly seven years, she will
never come on my hand, and is afraid of hands. She will get up on
my shoulder, but is uncertain in her temper, and will occasionally
turn round and give a pretty hard nip. She is terribly jealous of the
other birds, and I have to be careful not to pet any while she is out of
her cage, for if I do, she will fly right across the room, straight for my
head. She is a fair talker, and has learnt quite a good deal since she
came to me. I think if I had had her in her first youth she would have
been a charming bird, but her temper is too uncertain and at times she
screams in rather a persistent way, which is trying. She is never so
happy as when she is allowed to roam about a room, and she loves to
get under a piece of curtain, but she is the most destructive bird I have
and has to be watched all the time or she will have her beak into the
best chippendale chairs or leave a hole in the curtain.
My next Blue-front is Ena, a young cock bird that I bought as
a funny little fluffy brown baby in nestling plumage in January, 1920.
The youngest Parrot I have ever had, Ena was bought in a great hurry
to replace a sad and tragic loss, for I had had the most charming Yellow-
front, called Judy, who for months had been a bosom companion and had
lived incessantly on my bed, mostly under the eiderdown, for I was
ill at the time. But one morning, when my nurse was out of the room,
Judy took a flight and landed on the window ledge, where, before any-
thing could be done, she picked up and ate a piece of broken glass.
Poor little Judy ! she simply bled to death, for it had cut the intestine
about the sixth of an inch, and apparently nothing could be done.
1 missed her so dreadfully that two days after her death we phoned to
Gamage to see if they had anything that would do to fill the gap.
However, they had nothing at the moment that would suit me, so

De Von was visited, with the result that Ena was brought home. Now
Ena is an exceedingly independent nature--does not care to be nursed
or petted or even have his head scratched, but is developing into a
wonderful talker and whistler. He will come on my hand, in fact I
bring him down to breakfast like that every morning, but it is only on
sufferance. He is not yet in adult plumage, which I believe they don't
obtain for two or three years, but he has moulted, and certainly looks
a lot better than a year ago. He is an elegant slim bird, with much
darker green feathers than either of my hens -- a small, rather round
head, prettily marked with blue and yellow--more yellow than Richard
and like Richard the shoulder spot and speculum are pink rather than
red in colour. Richard will sometimes play in his cage either with
a piece of wood or chain, and very occasionally will lie on his back and
play with his toes in the way parrots do, but Ena, though he is still such
a baby, never has played, and I don't think ever will. He is entirely
taken up with talking, and starts with my early tea at 7 o'clock in the
morning, though still covered over, and goes on till he is again covered
over in the evening. He literally laughs and cries the whole day
through. He cries at times in the most heartrending way, sobbing out
at intervals, " Mother, I want Mother," and when it becomes really
desperate he will suddenly stop and laugh as heartily as he had cried,
as if it had been the greatest joke. He makes all the noises of a baby,
and, I think, would deceive anyone. This accomplishment he learnt
elsewhere. Every morning he asks himself in the most concerned
manner, " Ena, how are you ? Aren't you well ? " He imitates faithfully
cats mewing, dogs barking, the squeak of a certain tap, and other sounds
about the house, and as to whistling, I sometimes think he will drive
me grey, he is so quick at picking up. When first uncovered, and again
when it is getting time to be put to bed, he becomes very restless, and
it is the only time he shows an inclination to scream, but by taking him
on my hand and holding him up and letting him have a good flutter, it
generally has the desired effect of stopping him.
My third Blue-front that I have just now is quite a new acquisition,
having only been here three weeks. Dinah is a very young hen, and
one of the handsomest birds I have ever had. She has a slight
frontal band of blue, and a great deal of yellow of a deep colour,

extending beyond the eye and well down on to the breast.
The shoulder spot and speculum are of a vivid scarlet, and the dark
blue of the flight feathers is very rich in colour. I think Dinah and
I fell in love at first sight, for she had only been a few hours in Gamage&apos;s
when I saw her and made her acquaintance. She came immediately
on to my hand, and let me do as I pleased with her. I visited her many
times, but for a Avliole month resisted her charms, but each time I saw
her I wanted her more and more until one fine day the deed was done,
and I brought her home. The first morning I uncovered her and let
her out of her cage she seemed rather cross. She had certainly got out
of bed the wrong way. I believe, however, this was accounted for by
her being covered over. She probably was not accustomed to it, and
was too hot. That was speedily rectified, and she has never shown
any sign of being cross since, except when she thought my father was
going to take her away from me, when she tried her beak on his thumb !
Now Dinah is absolutely the opposite to Ena. She plays about the
whole day, swinging on a chain, lying on her back at the bottom of the
cage, and playing with a bit of stick, and never seems tired. Yet to me
she is one of the most gentle and loving birds I have ever had. I can
do anything with her, and the moment I come into the room she wants
to come to me to be nursed and petted. She and Ena live in the same
room, one in each window, and she is beginning to try and copy Ena in
the way of laughing, which is amusing to hear, but beyond saying
" Hulloa " and " Pretty Bird " and singing a little, I have not heard
her do much in the way of talking until a few evenings ago, when I
came in, and I must say they were both " going it ". Ena was saying
all he knew, and Dinah was chipping in in a loud voice with " Hurrah,
hurrah, hurrah ", and then talking what sounded like Portuguese. In
the Avicultural Magazine for June, 1902, in an article of Canon Dutton's,
I see he says that " some people think that female parrots are much
gentler than male birds." This has certainly been my experience,
though I cannot say that my knowledge of male birds has been very
great, for out of the thirteen Amazon Parrots that I have had I believe
only two have been cock birds. But both those cock birds have been
good talkers, very independent, and they have not wanted to be petted.
I had a theory that if one only acquired a bird young enough one could

mould it as one wished, but that theory, like a good many others, has
had to go to the wall. A great deal, I may say an enormous deal, can be
done in a young bird by persistent gentleness and patience, in fact
I believe that the whole temperament of a parrot depends entirely on
the treatment by its first owner. At the same time they have so much
individual character that one cannot make them all of one pattern.

Sirs, --In the March number of the Avicultural Magazine Mr. Meade-
Waldo writes that the Scarlet Ibis " loses its colour at once and
never recovers it, but remains a dull pink ". This is true of the bird
in close confinement, but the colour is retained for years if the bird has
access to water (not necessarily rich in natural food) and an extensive
grass range. If the enclosure is well sheltered, and contains plenty of
thick evergreens, the Ibises can be wintered out of doors, anyhow in
the Midlands, and require no other artificial food than chopped raw
meat.

RAVEN VERSUS RAT: ACTION DUE TO INSTINCT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995624" page_id="32670673"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --In one of the recent numbers of The Field there was (so far
as I now remember) a reply to a correspondent about food of Ravens,
such as worms, beetles, snails, mice, field voles, moles, birds ; but no
mention of rats. As the Rev. Bancks, of this village, had told me a few
weeks before about a Raven he kept in past years (" about 1902 "),
I thought its actions towards a rat might be worth mentioning.
Having caught a large rat uninjured, a friend suggested putting it
into the Raven's cage, and on this being done the bird at once attacked
it, and after putting a foot on it to hold it down, killed it with a single
peck in the body in stabbing fashion.
The scene clearly proved that Ravens will attack these rodents
when wild, and are therefore of some economic value.
In addition to the above, it may be of interest to say that the bird
was taken young from the nest, and therefore it is most unlikely it had
previously seen an older bird kill rats in this way. Therefore, the

method of stabbing the body seems to be due to instinct, and not
learnt by individual experience. The Raven&apos;s behaviour recalls the
cracking of snail shells, which a writer, Miss Frances Pitt, considers is
" probably learnt by personal experience " in young Thrushes (Ann. &amp;
Mag. Nat. Hist. 1919, pp. 529-31)--an opinion with which I cannot
agree from personal observations on these birds.
In support of the view that the action in Ravens is not learnt by
personal experience after leaving the nest, the Rev. Bancks informed
me most emphatically (he not knowing " the drift " of my question)
that his bird " did not attack the head ".
When we consider that adult Brown Rats can bite sharply in self-
defence, I should have thought a Raven, if the method was. learnt by
after experience, and was not instinctive, would have first attacked the
rat in the head to put it out of action, previous to delivering the blow
at the body of the rat. What is the experience of other people who
have fed Ravens on live rats ? Do these birds vary in method of
killing such prey ?
It might also be of interest to hear what a Raven would do with
a full-grown adder--whether attack it in the head, or whether disable
its spinal column before attempting to eat it--if any reader has made
observations on such.

By arrangement with La Societe d'Acciimatation de France, the
Council of the Avicultural Society hopes to be able to reproduce from time
to time plates of birds already published in the organ of the French
Society, which most of our members will have little opportunity of
seeing. For this highly appreciated privilege we are greatly indebted
to the Executive of la Societe d'Acciimatation, and more especially
to our esteemed member, Mons. J. Delacour, the distinguished president
of the section of ornithology of that body.
The plate in our current number is a beautiful representation of the
Long-tailed Roller (Coracias caudatus) in the possession of Mons. J.
Delacour, who gave us an account of it in our February issue for this
year. This Roller from Central and South Africa appears to be a rare
species in captivity. The Zoological Society, at all events, has never
been so fortunate as to secure it for exhibition.

The delay in the publication of this number of the Avicultural
Magazine, which the Editors greatly regret, is entirely due to there
being no contributions in hand at the time when the issue for May
was due to go to press. While gladly taking this opportunity of
expressing their grateful acknowledgements to the authors of the
articles above printed for their kind and prompt response to the urgent
appeal for " copy " that was made--a response which shows there is
no lack of interesting subject-matter to write about--the Editors feel
compelled to impress upon members the fact that they are both busy
men, with so many other calls upon their time and energies, that they
cannot undertake, in addition, the combined duties of editorship and
authorship of the Avicultural Magazine. While fully realizing that
" aviculture " has not as yet reverted to pre-war conditions, the
Editors feel sure that out of the several hundred members of the
Society there must be many with interesting items to record about
their birds, who from timidity or dilatoriness or the mistaken opinion
that the facts are of no importance or well known, refrain from putting

NOTES ON NEW ZEALAND BIRDS

By C. Barnby Smith
Having recently paid a few months' visit to the North Island of New
Zealand, I am recording some notes as to the birds I saw or failed to see,
thinking such notes may be of possible interest to some bird-lovers.
New Zealand is, as regards bird-life, at once the most surprising and
disappointing country I ever visited. One has read of Kiwis, Bell birds,
Kakapos, and other weird forms of bird-life, but on landing one rubs
one's eyes considerably and asks whether or not it is not really England.
There is the Sparrow in great abundance ; there are Thrushes, Black-
birds, Larks, Chaffinches, Starlings, Goldfinches, and a few more
English friends, but beyond these one may search for days and see
nothing--at least, such is my experience, and (even making due
allowance for defective observation on my part) I think the fact is
beyond doubt that the New Zealand native birds are to the ordinary
individual mainly conspicuous by their absence.
New Zealanders do not appear to be much interested in birds, but
if one asks why so few of the native birds are seen, the answer is always
either that the birds are in the back blocks or were common some
twenty or thirty years ago, and are now destroyed by stoats, bush
fires, shepherd dogs, rabbit poison, or other attendant blessings of
civilization.
I recently travelled fifty miles by rail in an out-of-the-way part of
the country, and looked out of the window the whole journey, hoping
to see some interesting birds, but I only saw two birds (Finches) during

C. Barnby Smith -- Notes on New Zealand Birds
the whole journey of four hours. Over a similar journey in England
one would, of course, have seen birds of many varieties in considerable
numbers.
If one takes a favourable position in the bush or manuka-scrub, or
amongst the fern or on the edge of cultivated lands, the result is just
as disappointing. Of course, there are still birds left in out-of-the-way
places, and some of them are very interesting. Off Cape Brett, for
instance, there are large numbers of Shags, Black-backed or Dominican
Gulls, Red-billed Gulls, Blue Herons, Terns, Gannets, Mutton Birds,
and many other kinds I did not know. At other points on the coast
there are long stretches without any bird-life whatever, except, perhaps,
an occasional Black-backed Gull or Shags. The Government make
some efforts to keep Shags within reasonable bounds as regards numbers,
but such efforts do not seem to meet with much success. To anyone
who has seen the birds on long stretches of New Zealand coast and then
turned to the water simply alive with fish, it is not surprising that
Shags find New Zealand a veritable paradise and multiply exceedingly.
One day I had an excellent view of a Blue Heron feeding. Instead
of standing patiently waiting in one spot, it walked rapidly about a
pool continually making stabs at the water and reminding me rather
of a somewhat active ibis. Although aware of my presence, it continued
to feed. The New Zealanders will insist on calling all Herons " Cranes
The White Heron and White-fronted Heron are exceedingly rare. The
Bittern I only saw once. These birds are supposed to be protected,
but the feathers are much sought after for making trout flies, and the
Maoris (and, I fear, sometimes the whites), knowing the value of the
skins, do not fail to procure them.
The Swamp Hen or Pukeko (Porphyria melanotus) is said to
be common. I doubt it, as it is a very tame bird and the Maoris kill
it for food. I have repeatedly seen a few of the birds on different
occasions, and they present a quaint appearance amongst the flax
rushes, manuka, and other undergrowth. I never saw any other Rails,
and (except in the case of the Weka Rails) could scarcely find anyone
who had heard of even their existence.
I much wanted to see a Wrybill Plover, but never got the
opportunity. Nowadays they are said to be extremely rare. I,

however, noticed quite a lot of little Plover, which I was told were
Sand Plover, though judging from illustrations they looked to me like
" Banded Dotterel Anyhow, they quite lacked the grace of form of
our own little Ringed Plover.
I got some excellent views of Pied Stilts feeding in a shallow lagoon
olT the edge of Lake Rotorua. I had previously seen one flying over }
but on inquiry was told there were no Stilts there. I should have
much liked a photo of the feeding birds, which were close at hand, and
in their movements reminded me of the Avocets at the London Zoo
when nesting there some years ago. Incidentally, I should like to ask
whether it would not be possible to get over to England some of these
Pied Stilts. They swarm on the coast in some places and at some
seasons. The Black Stilts are much rarer, and only once did I see (or
think I saw) a pair flying over. The Avocet seems non-existent in
New Zealand.
Weka Rails are by no means uncommon, and a friend of mine
travelling through the South Island describes them as being most
amusingly bold.
My inquiries as to Ducks were specially disappointing. One may
say of the average New Zealander---
A duck beside the river brim,
A Grey or Mallard is to him,
And it is nothing more.
Both Grey and Mallard are looked at from the culinary point of view
only. Anything outside these seems regarded as a harmless eccentricity
of nature of little account. It is plain, however, that constant shooting
with large duck guns has pretty well cleared many places which formerly
swarmed with duck of various kinds. In Government reserves, however,
there are still many varieties of interest to be found, as for instance at
Hamurana on Lake Rotorua, where Black Teal are very plentiful and
are quite tame. I never saw any Grebe of any kind, although I was
often in places where I expected to find them. On the other hand,
Black Swans are quite plentiful.
Kingfishers are common. The first I saw was on a croquet hoop
in a garden in the village of Russell. My surprise was naturally great,
but later I grew accustomed to expect them almost anywhere. The

82 G. Barnby Smith -- Notes on New Zealand Birds
New Zealand Kingfisher quite lacks in form and colour the grace and
beauty of our English bird.
As to Hawks, the Harriers seemed hanging in the air almost every-
where I went, and I was informed they did considerable damage, and
I fear are on the increase. Other Hawks appear to be quite rare. I do
not recall seeing a single specimen.
The Morepork Owl is the only owl common throughout the country.
The New Zealand Quail is now extinct, but imported Australian
Quail are found in some districts, though in small numbers. On the
other hand, the Californian Quail is very plentiful almost everywhere,
at any rate, in the North Island. I was much interested in watching
a pair of them with a brood of young on a road in the outskirts of Auck-
land last November ; the cock bird, of course, an embodiment of
fussiness and with the usual distracted sense of parental responsibility.
The Quail is, I think, the only game bird of all those imported which is
really successfid at the present time. Partridges have been a dead
failure, and pheasants have " gone back " and become scarce in many
places where formerly plentiful. The reason is probably five-fold,
namely : (1) bush burning, (2) poison laid for rabbits, (3) poaching by
Maoris, (4) a plague of stoats, and (5) Harrier Hawks.
I never saw any Kiwis, nor had I an opportunity to undertake the
lengthy search in back country blocks, which the attempt to see any
would have entailed. From many inquiries, however, I came to the con-
clusion that these birds are even now not so rare as is supposed, though,
of course, they are very seldom seen. The numbers that must be
destroyed by bush fires and stoats is, nevertheless, great. A friend
of mine, a farmer, spoke of it as being no uncommon occurrence for his
sheep-dog to kill Kiwis. The best way of catching them alive is by
a soft-mouthed retriever.
I was amazed to see in the New Plymouth district almost the
commonest bird was the Mynah. Whether they have come from " the
islands " on their own account, or have been artificially introduced,
I do not know. Sometimes they frequent a district, for a few years
and then all vanish. This was the case recently in a district near
Wellington, and the Mynahs were said to be driven out by the Starlings,
which sounds strange.

C. Barnby Smith--Notes on New Zealand Birds 83
The Huia is said to be extinct, but I have it on good authority that
the Maoris deny this, and could produce some if a licence were obtained
and they were paid to get the birds. The Maoris are keen observers of
many things, and their opinion in the matter of birds is usually worth
attention.
The Tui, or Parson Bird, is a bird in which the New Zealanders
take special pride, and as soon as birds are mentioned the question is
asked, " Have you seen or heard the Tui ? " and then follows a
rhapsody as to its note being much better than the nightingale's. I
have on several occasions seen these birds, but the excitement their
appearance causes is in itself an indication of their rarity. Bush fires
and bush clearance are doubtless the main causes.
Of small native birds the lovely little Fantails are the most con-
spicuous--quite fearless and very pretty to watch as they actively
move about the manuka or other bushes. The White-eye, or Zosterops
(which first came over from Australia about seventy years ago), is also
a delightful little bird and fairly common.
I never saw a Parrot in New Zealand. It is quite easy to find any
number of Keas if one goes to the right places. Kakas are rarer--
Kakapos very rare indeed (most New Zealanders seem never to have
even heard of them), whilst the smaller Parrakeets, although by many
believed to be extinct, yet are still to be found, I understand, in out-
of-the-way districts. They are, however, according to my information,
very erratic in their movements. None will be seen in a certain district
for some years ; then they come in considerable numbers quite suddenly,
and as suddenly vanish. Their extinction can, I fear, be only delayed
for a few years.
The good the Government is doing by protecting birds in the way
of reserves, both on the mainland and on certain islands, is worthy of
all praise by aviculturists, and I hope there is no truth in the statement
that stoats have found their way to at least one of the islands and that
the keepers on another of the islands keep cats. At present the
Government are not issuing any licences for export of native birds.
Considering the awful slaughter of birds that is taking place owing to
stoats, bush fires, rabbit poisoning, bush clearance, and other causes,
it seems a pity that a strictly limited number of licences to export are

not granted yearly to those genuinely interested in aviculture. The
indirect good in tending to educate public opinion as to the intense
interest of bird life would far outweigh the damage done by the relatively
small number of birds taken.
In conclusion I should like to express a hope that the above notes
of commonplace things are not unduly prolix ; my only excuse for
writing at all is that owing to changed conditions books and records
written only a few years ago are to day hopelessly misleading.

By Hubert D. Astley
My birds have been so frequently written about that it is difficult
for me to supply anything fresh. I had not realized how antagonistic
Stanley Cranes can become. My pair, the male being full-winged, was
completely docile for a year and a half, but this spring all that changed,
so that finally the male had to be caught and suffer the ignominy of
a clipped wing and imprisonment along with his mate in a wire enclosure.
They took to standing on a narrow bridge, or along a paved pathway,
defying humans who wished to pass along, and because it was I who
generally came to the rescue the male took an intense dislike to me,
attacking me savagely at every opportunity, especially when he saw
me in what he thought was retreat. His attack was no joke, for being
full winged, he jumped into the air a little above the level of one's face,
with extended legs and talons, so that one day as he descended he ripped
not only one of my stockings, but the leg which it covered, for these
crane's claws are excessively sharp and curved after the manner of a
bird of prey. One of the womenfolk, coming across the narrow paved
path between two ponds, encountered him. I was near by and called
out: " If you walk straight on I don't think he'll do anything." She
took my advice. In her arms was a large basket of clean linen, fresh
from the wash. Up flew the Stanley Crane, legs to the fore, catching
the basket with his claws. Tableau !
My only means of resisting his onslaughts was to arm myself with
a large landing-net, and even then he would charge again and again,
dodging the net, whilst I fenced with this rather cumbersome foil in

desperation ; and in such a tussle one day, I having apparently come
out as conqueror, putting the net over his head and pushing him into
the pond, where I held him down for half a minute, he was undefeated.
Shaking my fist at him, reminding him of his ingratitude for all my
loving care of him and his wife, I walked away. Hardly had I taken
five steps before--whirr ! a flapping of great pinions and he was at
me again. He will also attack an Alsatian wolf dog, bowling her right
over and leaving her terrified. If he behaved to children in this manner
he would be really dangerous.
Such a magnificent bird, and now deprived, through his own
foolishness, of flight. He no doubt regrets it, and so do I, for to see the
big bird coming over the house and flapping on broad pinions round the
meadows, calling as he went, was a fine and, in England, an utterly
uncommon sight. He never went far and never really high in the air,
his wife running to catch him up, shrieking at him to return, which he
always did. I have not actually pinioned him, and may permit him to
be full-winged once more during the winter. Not in the spring ! He
killed my White Peacock. Of course, having been practically living the
life of a wild bird, his condition is superb ; no Stanley Crane in Africa
could be better. When he is in a bad temper he puffs out his head
feathers beyond the normal, reminding one of the hood of a cobra.
Twice this year have my Australian Cranes (Native Companion)
had eggs, and each time (?) the Jackdaws have succeeded in filching
them. The birds had their nest in the middle of a large meadow, and
were fed there, so that they should not have to leave the eggs. The last
time, in May, they had incubated them for nearly thirty days, and
then suddenly the eggs were not!
The White-necked Cranes also had theirs, but they were clear.
The Manchurians are sitting as I write. Last year their eggs were
clear.
As to other species, I have been more successful, although I touch
wood when saying so ! My hen Satyr Tragopan laid twelve eggs and
then died, but out of the twelve I have seven young ones. Of all
charming chicks these are the most fascinating, because they are so
exceedingly fearless and free of any timidity, just as likely to fly on
t,o one's knee as on to their foster-mother's back (a Rhode Island Red

lien). Russet in colour, especially about the head, born with fully
developed wing feathers, and if the weather be fairly good, not at all
difficult to rear. I give them custard to commence with, mixed with
dried ants' cocoons and insectile food, but they soon take to pheasant
meal, and love lettuce chopped fine, dandelion leaves, etc., and clean
gentles. At a month old they have the colouring of the adult female -- -
a rich spotted russet-brown. At times one of them flies on to one's

are far tamer at this age, or any age, than Monauls. By the by, my old
hen Monaul (Impeyan Pheasant) has her brood of five, hatched by
herself in a small aviary, and two males reared by me in 1918 are still
at large. One in the woods, always wild ; the other amongst the poultry,
to whom he displays ridiculously, looking like some Eastern potentate
garbed in gorgeous violets and blues, and bedecked in sapphires and
emeralds with a neckpiece of burnished copper. His full display is
amusing. I have watched him in an orchard. He stoops to the ground,
works his opened wings up and down like a toy wound up, then rushes
forward for a few yards in this position, suddenly stopping, raising
himself up, turning and walking away with head in the air, chestnut
tail widely spread, and white rump gleaming. An extraordinary
spectacle, but not so fascinating, nor really so beautiful, as the display
of the Tragopans.
My male Satyr Tragopan was very pugnacious this last April
(I do not know why, but so many birds seemed to be full of a war-like
spirit this year ; it is catching, I suppose), and attacked me in
the aviary, spurring my hands and drawing blood. Then he would
walk round me, swelling out all his splendid Venetian-red body, starred
with white spots, compressing his head feathers, and letting clown
his horns, brilliant turquoise blue-green, a marvellous contrast of
colour against the black of the crest and the glowing red of the body,
never quite showing all his wattle, which is turquoise blue with rose
spots, as vivid as the finest Limoges eicamel, and more so. One so
seldom is there at the right moment to see the full display, which only
lasts three weeks at the most. My aviary-keeper told me that the male
Tragopan jumped on to his back very often when he was stooping down
to clean up, where the bird would peck angrily at his cap, and how one

day when he suddenly dislodged him the Tragopan's wattle was fully
displayed, so that the bird probably always showed this beauty on these
occasions; but as he was on my bird-keeper's back, the latter could not
see what was going on. And all the time the Tragopan kept up a
clucking which would grow into a subdued version of the loud, weird
" wa-a-a-ah ! " which he utters in the courting season, opening his
mouth as wide as Tetrazzini when she achieves a top note !

On a recent visit to Clifton I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Burgess's
very fine collection of birds, and was greatly surprised to find such a
number of rarities. They are kept in a bird-room, which is fitted
up with numerous aviaries where many different species live together
on the best of terms. It would be extremely difficult to say which was
the rarest bird in this collection of rarities. There is a fine specimen of
the White-rumped Lory ( Eos fuscata), an equally good Black Lory
(Chalcopsittacus ater ), and a little further along one comes across three
examples of the Varied Lorikeet (Ptilosclera versicolor), a species which
I thought had not been imported since 1902, when the first arrival of
this species from North-west Australia made quite a sensation amongst
aviculturists, as some of the older members of this Society will
remember.
Starlings and Bower Birds.-- There was one compartment full
of Glossy Starlings of several species, including Burchell's, the Long-
tailed, Green, and others of some of those smaller species which are
very difficult to identify without careful comparison. There were

immature male.

Conures, not to mention a host of Blue Budgerigars and Green
Budgerigars that have been bred from Blues, and are likely therefore
to produce Blues. There were Black-capped Lories intent upon nesting,
Hawk-headed Parrots, Guira Cuckoos, an Oven Bird, Pted-eheeked
Colies, and a great many more that I have forgotten.
Brinsop Court. --Thanks to the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Astley,
I visited Brinsop Court, justly famed on account of the great interest
attaching to the house itself, and its splendid collection of birds.
Mr. Gerard Gurney has given us an account of the latter, and little
therefore remains to be said. Not only does the collection contain
many great rarities, but all are in the most splendid condition and kept
in ideal surroundings. When I was there during the last days of April
several interesting birds were nesting. The European Cranes in the
Park had just been robbed by Crows, but White-necked Cranes were
sitting. We found several Ducks' nests near the moat, and in the
aviary itself Queen Alexandra Parakeets were incubating ; one hen
paired to her proper mate, another to a cock Barraband Parrakeet.
Baby Blue Budgerigars peeped from their nesting logs, and a Monaul
Pheasant hen sat tightly on five eggs. A number of eggs had been
laid by a Satyr Tragopan, which were being incubated by a domestic
hen, and I hear since that seven chicks have been hatched, while the
Monaul has a brood of five.
The Wood Hoopoe or Kakelaar. --Amongst a collection from
South Africa received by Mr. Hamlyn, I noticed a fine specimen of the
Wood Hoopoe (Irrisor viridis), which is, I believe, the first ever
imported. This bird has the head, neck, and upper back glossy green,
the rump and upper tail-coverts and wings blue, the latter spotted with
white. The strongly graduated tail is blue, the outer feathers spotted
with white ; the throat and neck are steel-blue, and the breast green.
The long, curved bill and the legs and feet are red. This is a forest-
loving species, frequenting the highest trees and usually associating
in parties of some half-dozen birds. They are said to possess an
extremely disagreeable odour.
Tataupa Tinamous. --Among the recent additions to the Zoological
Society's collection are six specimens of the Tataupa Tinamou
(\0x25A0Crypturus tataupa), a representative of a remarkable group of South

American birds with very extraordinary breeding habits. A fall
account of these birds, and of their nesting and rearing young in
captivity, appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for August and
October, 1904, and with the first of these instalments appeared a
coloured plate of the adult and newly hatched chick. In the
Tinamous the female is the larger and more vigorous bird, and
she courts the male, who incubates the eggs and rears the
young; but the duties of the female Tinamou are not finished
for the season when she has laid one clutch of eggs. She takes
no further interest in male No. 1, but looks around with much
calling for male No. 2, and having found him she lays a second clutch
of eggs, which he proceeds to incubate, and in all probability, in the
wild state, this is repeated with two or three more males. In
the case of the Tataupas bred in 1904, no less than fourteen
young birds were reared in the one season from a single female
and two males. When male No. 1 commenced to incubate his
batch of four pink eggs, the female was transferred to another
compartment of the aviary, in which was male No. 2. She
promptly set about nesting again, and laid him a clutch, and by the
time he had sat out his period of twenty-one days the brood hatched
by No. 1 were nearly reared and the female was allowed to go back
to her first mate. The third clutch of eggs followed and was hatched
by No. 1, and subsequently a fourth which No. 2 eventually hatched.
This habit of polyandry in birds is not confined to the Tinamous ;
it obtains also in the Hemipodes, or Bustard Quails, and probably in
other species, such as the Phalaropes and Painted Snipe, in which the
female is the larger and more brightly coloured of the two sexes.
Chukot* Partridges.-- Mr. Maurice Portal writes : " I have a pair
of Cretan Chukor Partridges (Caccabis saxatilis) breeding in the garden.
The nest is made by scraping out a round hole, some six inches deep,
which both birds work at by turning round and round in it. The cock
then collects a leaf or piece of straw, and tosses it back over his shoulders
to the hen, who takes it and puts it in the nest, which is a very rough
affair. She lays daily, but for some reason the cock goes on the nest
every day for a bit. They desert very easily. I removed three eggs
at the top, using a spoon for the purpose, as there were twelve in the

nest and the bottom ones were so deep down that I thought they could
not get any heat. The cock came up, looked in and went off and
brought the hen, who had a good look, too. Both then went off to the
potting shed and proceeded to make a new nest a couple of feet away
from the gardener's feet as he was working, and laid at once."

From time to time one reads in the daily papers of strange friend-
ships between different kinds of birds and animals. One of the most
curious cases of this kind that has come under my notice has occurred
this spring in one of my aviaries. Last autumn I bought from Handyn
a pair of South African Plovers ; these on arrival proved to be
Temminck's Coursers, an adult hen and a young one. They were very
pretty little birds, a trifle larger than our Ringed Plover. The hen
was in bad health and did not live long, but by keeping it indoors
during the winter, and by careful nursing, I managed to save the
young one. This spring I turned it into an aviary with a South African
Quail hen and two or three pairs of small birds. From the first it tried
to make friends with the Quail, but the latter did not respond. Later
on I introduced a cock Egyptian Quail as a mate for the southern
bird. The little Plover at once attached itself to it, and when handed
a mealworm, which it would take from my fingers, it would trot away
in search of its friend, calling to it in a low and rather plaintive whistle.
Very soon the Quail would come at once in response to the whistle,
and I regret to say that he now pays more attention to the Plover than
he does to his more legitimate mate. Mealworms are rather scarce,
and the other birds in the aviary have always looked on with rather
jealous eyes as I have handed them out to the Plover. The little
wretch will devour a dozen at a time if allowed to do so, but never
before he has carried one or two to the Quail. Latterly affairs in this
respect have become more complicated, as pairs of Diuca Finches
(Diuca minor) and Golden Breasted Buntings (Emberiza faviventris)
have nested in the aviary, and it has been quite a common sight to see
one of these birds snatch the worm from the beak of the Plover before

he could get to the Quail with it. The astonishment and indignation of
both the Quail and the Plover are quite comic. Recently a little Black-
cap Warbler hen found its way into the aviary, I don't quite know
how, but it has become apparently a willing prisoner. This bird has
proved a great thorn in the flesh to our two friends, as not only will
it snatch the worms from out of their very beaks, but it will even catch
them in the air when thrown to them. It is extraordinary how tame
this bird has become in a short time. One day it helped itself to some
bread and milk I was carrying in my hand. The Plover is now coming
into adult plumage. In juvenile plumage they are very like miniature
Golden Plovers. If a true pair could be obtained I feel sure that they
would breed here.

The Value of Insectivorous Birds
The current number of the Auk, vol. xxxviii, No. 2, contains the
concluding parts of Alfred 0. Gross's paper upon the Dickcissel ( Spiza
americana ) and of Harrison F. Lewis's article on the nesting of the
Philadelphia Vireo, the first parts of which were noticed in a recent
number of our magazine. The former is principally devoted to the
plumage changes from the time of hatching to maturity, the various
phases being illustrated by over a score of photographs, but to avicul-
turists perhaps the most interesting section will be the pages devoted to
the food of this bird from its earliest days to the time of its death.
Mr. Gross clearly shows that although this bird eats a certain amount
of grain, mostly waste grain, at harvest-time, it is of incalculable benefit
to the farmer for the number of grasshoppers it destroys. He computes
that in the State of Illinois alone the Dickcissels during the active period
of the nesting season save the State over four million dollars a day by
keeping down the grasshoppers which feed on the growing hay-crops.
Divorce amongst Wrens
Mr. S. Prentice Baldwin has some interesting observations on the
banding, what we call the " ringing ", of birds, and of the practical
application of this method of identification to the study of the habits
of the House Wren ( Troglodytes aedon). He shows, incidentally, that

" divorce " in the case of this species is not an uncommon phenomenon,
and that the old and more or less generally accepted belief that most
birds mate for life, and each year return to the site of the previous
nest to rear their young, must, like most cherished sentiments connected
with animals, be abandoned so far as this Wren is concerned, and be
regarded as still sub judice in the case of other species.
Sparrotvs and Motor Traffic
Apart from the other articles already noticed, perhaps the one that
will interest our readers most is a short account of the reaction of
motor-cars upon our ubiquitous and much abused friend the Common
Sparrow in Denver City. Mr. W. H. Bergtold sums up the results of
his investigations as follows : --
(1) There are fewer Sparrows in Denver than ten years ago ; (2)
there has been a notable decrease in the horse population of Denver
during the past five years ; (3) there has been a very patent diminution
in the amount of sweepings gathered from the streets of Denver during
the past decade ; (4) the reduction in street sweepings has resulted in
diminishing the Sparrow population by starvation ; (5) all these results
hinge on the introduction and multiplied uses of the motor-vehicle.

A CURIOUS FEATHER

Sirs,-- Amongst the many readers of the Avicultural Magazine
I wonder if anyone can give me an explanation as to the cause of
malformed feathers. In May, 1917, I obtained a Grey Parrot--quite
a young bird, for he still had the black eyes which began to change
about a month after I had him, so I judged him to be about 8 months
old. I noticed in the right wing he had a malformed feather. It is a
kind of double feather split down the middle, the split edges being red.
He has no other feather like it, the rest of the plumage being smooth
light grey. I naturally thought that when he moulted the new
feather would be a normal one, but I was mistaken ; each year he has
shed it, and each year the same malformed feather appears. As far

be glad of any suggestion as to the cause of this curious feather.

I have ever seen. I hope one or two others have been, or will be, saved.
I should like to have one. It is difficult to account for their curious
abnormality, but I suspect that it is due to the fusion of two feather
germs, owing to an abnormal shortening of that portion of the skeleton
to which this, or perhaps these two feathers, is attached. Will you ask
your correspondent which number in the series this represents ? If a
section were carefully and cleanly cut through the calamus of this feather,
I believe we should find a double column of pith cells, each representing
a single feather. But I have not ventured to cut the feather up.

to some abnormality or some injury to the papilla."

No. 1 is about the size of a Cowbircl, but in colour it is like the female
of the Black Tanager. The inner webs of its flight feathers are whitish.
Its bill, which is very short and greyish in colour, is the stoutest I have
seen in any Grosbeak.
No. 2 is about the size of a Canary, and its general body colour is
brownish-grey, heavily striated on the breast with a darker shade of the
same colour. Its forehead and throat are huffish yellow.
No. 3 is a very pretty bird about the same size as the last. General
colour chocolate ; throat, cheeks, and eyebrow, streaks white ; head,
tail, and a band below throat, black ; flight feathers, black with their
base white ; under-parts pale chocolate.
This bird is a fine singer and is undoubtedly a cock. The only sound
I have heard from the others is a sparrow-like chirp, so they may be
females.

Sirs, -- As regards the remarks by Dr. Amsler about food of Swain-
son's Lorikeet, and by Mr. Seppings, it may be worth adding that when
I was Assistant Medical Officer at the County Asylum, Hereford, in
1902 and 1903, there were two Lorikeets, almost certainly Swainson's,
in a large cage in " Ward I, Women's Side ". One of the patients used to
feed these birds regularly with the usual milk puddings given to human
occupants, namely, rice, tapioca, etc., made with fresh cow's milk,
and during the time I was&apos;there the birds were both very healthy. I
used to given them bits of bread and plain cake, but, like Dr. Amsler's
birds, they did not care much for fruit.
This pair at the Asylum were amusing in the way they treated with
contempt and complete indifference the few patients who were inclined
to try and interfere with them. On the other hand, they were very
friendly with patients who fed them, never attempting to pedc. During
the time I knew them one of the men patients working at the farm
threw a stone at a squirrel and knocked it down, it being stunned
sufficiently to make it easy to capture alive ; and on its recovery I
put it into another large cage near the Lorikeets, but with several feet
between the two cages. On seeing the squirrel both Lorikeets got

tremendously excited for some days -- presumably thinking it was some
inhabitant of their native country--and would, it seemed to me, have
readily attacked it, had they been allowed. Are they hostile to small
mammals ? Whether the above birds are still alive I cannot say,
but if any readers are in that neighbourhood it might be worth
inquiring, because, if so, it would throw some light on the length of
life in the species.
Can Dr. Amsler give any information about the age of his male
and female ? Are they about the same age ? If not, which is the older
bird ? If such facts are known they might be useful knowledge for
breeders trying to mate up a pair in the future.

Sirs, --With reference to the Scarlet Ibis, Lord Tavistock is quite
right; these birds will retain their colour in captivity. My bird has
moulted out a richer colour this year than last; some of its feathers
are quite scarlet. It is in a large aviary with a good-sized pond, and is
fed on bread and milk, biscuit meal, and cooked meat. A young
Roseate Spoonbill that I had for nearly two years never came into
colour, but the bird was never in very good health, which perhaps
accounted for this.

(Continued from p. 87.)
For some six or seven years a female Ruddy-headed Goose
(Chloephaga riibicliceps) had almost entirely ignored her own kith and
kin at Brinsop, and has been dubbed " The lady in waiting ", for, like
Mary's lamb, she follows a pair of Manchurian Cranes everywhere.
If the Cranes move too rapidly at times the Goose, which is full-winged,
catches them up by flying. And then came a male Monaul, he who
struts amongst the poultry, taking upon himself the office of lord-in-
waiting, and driving off the Goose, so that at last the latter had to
resign her post. It is most incongruous to see the Monaul in full and
resplendent uniform, trotting at the Crane's heels. The Goose was less
so, but Manchurian Cranes and Monauls are so widely apart in
appearance and habits. If the Cranes do not proceed as fast as the
Monaul thinks they should, he pecks their heels, and will trot in this
manner all about a large meadow. The Cranes must share the feelings
of royalty and foster a desire to be sometimes permitted to go out on
their own.
I have bad luck with my Cranes. Each year Manchurians, White-
necked and Australian, have eggs (they are true pairs), but the eggs
are always infertile. Yet the Australians, at any rate, have been seen
to mate.
This year I have managed to find more Ducks' eggs than usual,
for the Ducks are at liberty on the moat surrounding the house, and the

two ponds in the garden, and can, furthermore, stray away, which
some of them do in the breeding season, so that nests are difficult to
find. However, I have a goodly number of young summer Ducks,
(Carolina), some Pintails, and three Bahamas. It is far better to hatch
them under Bantams, and I find Yokohama Bantams are excellent
mothers. Large hens cannot help crushing the tiny ducklings during
the first two or three days of their lives, for the ducklings lie so flat
and are apparently nothing but down, so that the hens are, however
worthy their intentions, quite unaware when they have their feet on
the babies. I keep my ducklings in small Bantam's houses, shutting
them at night in the roosting houses, which have sliding doors for
exit into the wired runs, which are covered. There are no floors to these
runs, and the houses can be wheeled on to fresh grass every day. A
large pan filled with duck-weed and just enough water for the ducklings
to dibble in is provided, the duck-weed being gathered from a pond
and teeming with shrimps. Duck-meal is scattered on the grass and
amongst the weed, and I also give clean maggots and fly cocoons. I put
an earthenware saucer of moistened meal in the little roosting-house
when the birds are shut in for the night, so that they can feed as early
as they like next morning, and be out of danger from rats during the
night. A few years ago I had a brood of. eight Pintails, half-grown and
feathering well. I left the shutter of the roosting-house open one
night. Next morning five were lying mauled and dead. A rat had
worked in under the wire run !
I have had great hopes that my pair of Indian Cotton Teal would
nest. The only pair in Europe ! which I have had for eight years.
The little male has displayed constantly to his mate this spring, and
as constantly uttered his curious call, which may be described as
kak-kak ! kak-kak-kak ! A very conspicuous bird in his nuptial
plumage, snow white face and flanks, and bottle-green back ; a black
line divides the white of the neck from that of the flanks. The eyes are
ruby red. I have never seen these birds dive, and to eat grain under
water it must be in the shallows, where they can reach it by tipping up.
I would that more of this tiny and lovely species could be sent to
England, since I have proved that it can be most easily kept, and is
apparently as long-lived as other ducks, and very hardy.

I have a male Golden-eye mated to a female Tufted Duck. Last
year she successfully concealed her nest and hatched out her brood of
*eight or nine, but as usual all disappeared, one after the other. One
tries to throw food to these Ducks with young ones, but either they
at once swim hard in an opposite direction, or adult Ducks assemble
and devour it. The only species I could induce to be sensible and
recognize one was wishing to help them to rear their young, has been
the Shelduck. I have four Bar-headed Goslings, hatched under a hen.
In the aviary a pair of Ked-crested Grey Cardinals had three young
ones, but they were taken by something. That is the worst of a mixed
collection. My Diamond Doves suffer likewise. Three pairs have had
nests, and each time the young have been killed, neither can I discover
the culprit; so that I consider I have lost at least six Diamond Doves
this spring. One day I saw a Budgerigar on one of the nests, doing its
best to turn out the eggs, and although I scared it away it was
apparently successful, for two days after the eggs had disappeared.
On 3rd June a boy brought me a fully fledged young Lesser Spotted
Woodpecker, which he had picked up in the road, possibly injured.
A charming little bird. Perhaps it had tried to fly across the road on
leaving the nest, and had fallen short. I fed him at first on fly-
chrvsalises, opening his beak for the purpose, but he did not live.
I say "he" because the wish was father to the thought ! The female
lacks the red on the head, which is such an additional beauty to the
black and white barred plumage. This little bird seemed such a pigmy
by the side of my Golden-headed Woodpecker from the Himalayas.
On the aviary lawn the Noah's ark is cosmopolitan. Amongst the coops
and Bantam runs containing Ducklings of three or four species, young
Ho-kis (eared pheasants), Bar-headed Goslings, Satyr Tragopan chicks,
and Yokohama Bantams, there stroll white Peafowl and two Duiker
Antelopes and Demoiselle Cranes, following one for tit-bits. The
Trumpeter had to be shut up, as he showed signs of pecking the baby
Tragopans, and he is absolutely fearless of attacks from hens, for he
waves his wings at them and quite dismays them.

By T. H. Newman, M.B.O.U.
On 1 st May of last year two Rosy-grey Turtle-doves were deposited
in the Zoological Gardens, one of which was afterwards presented to the
Society by Major Maurice Portal on 30th July.
When considering this species one is confronted with one of those
fascinatingly maddening problems of nomenclature. These birds
were entered under the name of " Turtur roseigriseus Unfortunately
we are now forbidden to use Turtur in this connexion, since it must be
applied to the little African Amethyst- and Emerald-spotted Doves,
formerly known as Chalcopelia, which sounds like a riddle--when is
a Turtle-dove not a Turtle-dove ? The answer to which I suppose would
be, when it is a Turtur, for no one is likely to call the species of
Chalcop&amp;gt;elia Turtle-doves; also the specific name must be spelt
roseogrisea, as Sundevall wrote " C(olumba) roseogriseam vocamus".
The Turtle-doves (with the exception of the tranquebarica group) are
now placed in the genus Streptopelia.
The extraordinary interest of the Rose-grey Turtle-dove lies in the
fact that there can be no reasonable doubt that it was the wild ancestor
from which the familiar so-called Barbary Dove has been derived.
I have before referred to this in our Magazine, 1 when I stood sponsor
to the Burmese race of the well-known Indian Ring or Collared Turtle-
dove. I am glad to say that this form has been upheld and is mentioned
both in Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker's 2 beautiful book on Indian Columbce,
and by Dr. Hartert in his great work on Palsearctic birds, 3 and I also
possess eggs taken in Burma and kindly presented to me by Mr. Stuart
Baker. Lest it might be thought that I feel unduly elated by this, let
me mention that not only did I receive a rebuke from our present
Hon. Secretary at the time for presuming to describe a new form without
a type specimen (the bird I founded my description on was destroyed
by rats), but Mr. Douglas Dewar in his entertaining book, Birds of
the Plains, made some amusing remarks on changes of nomenclature

in what he calls " Up-to-date species-making He thinks every bird
has its name changed about once in each decade. He noted my paper
* on the Collared Turtle-dove of Burma, which he at last discovered to
be a form of the bird which has been known as the Indian Ring Dove,
Turtur risorius, of most of the older well-known writers on Indian
birds. He is greatly exercised on my daring to describe a new form,
and continues : " Thus Mr. T. H. Newman has discovered that the
skin round the eye of the ring dove of Burma is not whitish, as it is in
India, but yellow ; Mr. Newman therefore manufactures a new sub-
species, which he calls Turtur decaocta xanthocyclus, as opposed to the
Indian bird which he calls Turtur decaocta douraca. We may consider
ourselves lucky that he has not made a new sjDecies of the Burmese
bird ! " I expressly stated that I did " not for a moment think the
bird " would ,# be found worthy of specific rank As Mr. Dewar does
not seem to be acquainted with the Burmese bird, his objections cannot
be taken very seriously. The name douraca of 1844, being a nomen
nudum, cannot be used, but as the Indian bird has not yet been found to
possess constant distinguishing characteristics from the East European
form it can be united with the latter under typical decaocta, or, more
correctly, decaocto, as originally spelt. As this is the bird which has been
so persistently called " risorius ", I must once more run through
what has been written about it. The original reference is Columha
risoria, Linne, Syst. Nat., ed. x, i, p. 165 (1758), and on the strength of
Habitat in India, this has been supposed to refer to the common Ring
Dove of India; Linne based his name chiefly, among others, on the
" Turtur Indians " of Aldrovandus. Mr. Stuart Baker in Indian
Pigeons and Doves uses risoria for this species and accuses me, quite
correctly, of not referring to the works of Aldrovandus, Brisson, and
Linne. He mentions the figure published by Aldrovandus in 1637,
under the name of Turtur Indicus, the female of which was said to be
white with red feet and blackish bill. This figure, which Mr. Stuart
Baker calls " an excellent plate of the Turtle-dove " is not coloured,
and I agree with Dr. Hartert in thinking it might equally well represent
a Barbary Dove, or a wild Indian one or one of several African species.
There is nothing either in Aldrovandus's long account or in those of
any of the other authors quoted by Linne which would lead one to

suppose that they were acquainted with the Indian bird, while, on the
other hand, the cage-bird is quite unmistakably referred to. In 1735
Eleazar Albin published a coloured plate of " The Turtle-dove from the
East Indies " ; this is a quite excellent figure of a Barbary Dove.
He mentions that " they are tame, pretty birds, and kept in cages by
the curious, in which they will breed and bring up their young ".
Latham, Syn. ii, 2, p. 648, No. 42, 1783, under Collared Turtle,
gives a good description. He mentions " the fore-neck and breast,
white, with a vinaceous tinge, the rest of the underparts white, tail . . .
the two middle feathers plain, the others tipped with white and the outer
one white on the outer edge. This inhabits India, but is a bird common
in France, and other parts of the European continent, but I do not
hear of it at large in England ". He adds a note : " Some think as far
as Sweden, but I think Linnaeus's words do not justify this. He says
" Habitat in India, nobis communis Turtur ," by which I should think
he only means that it is everywhere kept in cages, as with us in England.
Latham's description is evidently taken from that of Brisson's Turtur
torquatus ; he gives all Linne's synonyms, as well as others. Both
Albin and Brisson are quoted by Linne as referable to his Columba
risoria, the latter, of course, not until a, later edition, as Brisson's work
was not published before 1760. Temminck and Knip, Les Pigeons,
Fam. sec. pi. 44 (1808-11), under Columba risoria, as of Latham, 1790,
give a good figure of a Barbary Dove, and two plates later one of the
white variety, giving it the name of Columba alba, and stating its origin
to be China.
As long ago as 1873, Schlegel, Mus. Pays Bas. Columb., p. 123, 1
seems to have pointed out that Linne's C. risoria referred to the Barbary
Dove, as Stejneger, Pr. U.S. Nat. Mus., x, p. 426, 1887, wrote: " It is
curious that Schlegel's very clear argument should not have been
sufficient to settle beyond dispute the fact that the domestic King Dove,
which Linnaeus described as Columba risoria is not a descendant of
the wild bird of India, China, and Japan usually so-called. The
domesticated species belongs to that group of the sub-genus Streptopelia,
which has a comparatively short tail, with the outer tail-feathers entirely
1 I regret that I have not been able to see this paper, as they were unable to
find it for me in the Zoo Library when I inquired for it quite lately.--T. H. N.

white in the outer web, and it is entirely beyond all probability that
these features which are the normal ones of the genus should have been
derived from the lengthened tail and the blackish outer web of the
outer tail-feathem of T. douraca , features entirely unique. Besides,
there are wild species which in these characters are identical with the
domestic birds, without differing more from it in other respects than
does the wild T. douraca ."
And lastly, Dr. Hartert, Nov. Zool. s xxiii, pp. 78-80, 1916, has gone
very fully into the matter, and shows that all previous writers quoted
by Linne were merely acquainted with the domestic bird, which they
sujwosed to have come from India ; he then gives details to show that
the Barbary Dove cannot be derived from the wild Indian one, but that,
on the contrary, it agrees very closely with roseogrisea of N.E. Africa.
To return to the birds deposited in the Zoological Gardens, they
certainly so closely resembled the tame bird that they could very easily
pass for small, brightly coloured, Barbary Doves. I was most anxious
to hear their notes, which would have quite settled the question of
origin. I paid them several visits at close quarters, but not a syllable
would they utter, and I suspect them of being hens, the one there now
certainly seems to be one. Dr. Hartert quoted that S. roseogrisea has
the same call as that of our domestic race, though he tells me he has
not heard it himself. I think it has now been quite proved that this
African bird is the ancestor of our Barbary Dove, to which Linne gave
the name of C. risoria. The name itself while most appropriate for the
domesticated bird would be quite misleading for the Indian species
which does not laugh !
It is very greatly to be hoped that more specimens of the Rose-grey
Turtle-dove may be shortly imported. It is a very common bird in
the Egyptian Soudan. Mr. A. L. Butler records, Ibis, p. 359, 1905,
that it is quite one of " the commonest Doves in the Soudan ". He
found it " in thousands round the wells of Bara, in Kordofan ", while
the Hon. N. C. Rothschild and Mr. A. F. R. Woolaston, writing on birds
from Shendi on the Nile, midway between the Albara river and
Khartoum, Ibis, p. 25, 1902, say that it " was exceedingly common.
Upwards of fifty might sometimes be seen sitting in one of the bigger
trees near the river ; it was also well distributed all over the desert,

but less numerous there. Several nests were found in acacia-bushes
at heights varying from 3 to 6 feet from the ground. They were
light structures of twigs, very similar to those of the European Turtle-
dove. The number of eggs was two in every case, they are white with
very little gloss : average measurements 29 - 2 by 23 mm."
The birds from South Arabia have been given the subspecific name
of arabica on account of certain portions of the plumage, which are
pure white in typical roseogrisea, being more or less marked with
dove-grey ; the black collar is also said to be less broad.
Since the domestic Barbary Dove, S. risoria, is derived from the
S. roseogrisea, the question now seems to be, ought not the wild bird to
be included under the former specific name, since it is so much older ?
This was actually done by Erlanger, J. f. 0., p. 123,1905, pi. vi, though
not in this sense, as unfortunately he applies risoria typically to the
Indian bird, thus making roseogrisea a subspecies of a form with which
it has nothing in common.

Over a hundred years ago Bechstein wrote about the Hawfinch :
" Only a passionate lover of birds would wish to keep this species."
This libel has been repeated from time to time until now, except for
show purposes, a Hawfinch is rarely kept.
I hope to a certain extent to be able to defend this truly handsome
and delightful bird ; but must, at the commencement, state that I
write entirely of the hand-reared bird. I admit that he is a somewhat
uncertain problem to rear, but a mixture of insect food and Osborne
biscuit will see him through, provided that the utmost care is taken from
the beginning to keep him free from the least draught.
After a Hawfinch has passed his first year, he seems to harden, and
is then a bird of quite sturdy constitution.
A Hawfinch which I have in my possession has quite a genius for
games. He flies on to my shoulder at meal-times and pulls my ear,
looking sideways at any object which takes his interest. He will steal
a salt-spoon, take it into his cage, and behave in the most absurd

manner with it. Once, when on my shoulder, he started to sing his
own song. I added a whistle, whereupon he flew straight back into his
cage and sulked. He is absolutely tame and fearless. If I brush my
finger across the bars of his cage he will dash after it as if he intended
to tear me to pieces, but only to give me a gentle nibble when he catches
my finger.
His natural song is not unpleasant, but he has picked up the song of
a Roller Canary, and, although I cannot claim that he can execute all
the special " tours ", his imitation of the roll would deceive most
people.
At present he is in a partitioned cage with a hen Bullfinch, and to
see him " display" with his crest feathers erect, and his wings drooped
like a Starling, while he rolls out his Canary song, is most fascinating.
I have mentioned the partition in the cage, which is necessary, as
Mrs. Bully is liable to sudden fits of rage, and unless I can slide the
partition between them she will thrash him most unmercifully while
he, to his credit, behaves like a perfect gentleman.
In conclusion, if any of our members can obtain a nest of young
Hawfinches and rear them, I can assure- them that not only are the
birds worth keeping, but are the most delightful and engaging pets,
as tame as a Bullfinch and as amusing as a Jackdaw.

By the Hon. Mrs. Algernon Bourke.
1 was fortunate enough to pay a visit to the Zoological department
of A. W. Gamage in June at the moment that a consignment of African
birds had arrived. The train, to use a metaphor, was coming in as I
stepped on to the platform. I was unable to examine the contents of
all the cages, owing to the latter being still covered with gauze wire,
but one bird especially attracted my attention, which I secured. It
is said to be Tarsiger stellatus, and is, I imagine, the first importation
of the species. It is allied to the Redstarts, Forest Chats, Robin Chats,
etc., and my bird superficially reminds me of a Niltava, but the legs
are longer than in the Flv-catchers.
Slightly larger than the Chestnut-breasted Blue Niltava, the

White-starred Bush Robin has the head and neck with the wings and
upper side of the tail smalt blue ; the back and rump being sage-green.
Underparts, including the tail feathers, amber-yellow ; legs and beak
blackish. But the bird's distinctive and most interesting feature con-
sists of the two small white spots on either side of the lower forehead,
above the beak, which appear and disappear as the bird erects or
depresses the feathers of the head, and from these " stars " its name of
" stellata " has been derived.
It came over in beautiful condition, and within ten days it was
singing, and continues to do so every morning when it comes out of
its cage for a flight round the room, to which it returns of its own accord.
The song resembles that of the blackbird, and it is altogether a most
charming and attractive pet. It is fed on insectile food and live ants'
eggs and a few mealworms daily.
\Tarsiger stellatus occurs in the forest districts of South Africa,
but little has been recorded of its habits. It is said to be shy and to
inhabit thick bush, and according to Ayres to resemble our Robin in
its habits. There is little doubt that this is the first example to be
imported of a very beautiful species, of which it is to be hoped other
specimens will reach this country. The sexes are outwardly alike.--

This is a particularly interesting time amongst the birds at the
Zoological Gardens, as a good many species are nesting. In the Great
Aviary we have for the first time for many years a good stock of Sacred
Ibises. Two pairs have taken jiossession of a willow-tree, which has
been trained to form a fiat table-like top, and one nest contains two big
young birds, while the other, at the time of writing, is in process of
construction. This is not the first time that Sacred Ibises have bred
in the Gardens, as a single bird was hatched and reared in 1877.
Young Sacred Ibises. --The young Ibises have the body covered
with white down, and the head and neck with black down, and
the parents feed them in the same Avay that Pigeons feed their young,
namely by regurgitation, the bill of the young bird being held in that

of the parent. In captivity the feeding of these birds presents no
difficulty, even when they have young, meat, fish, and egg sufficing.
In the wild state they are said to be very destructive, during the breeding
season, amongst the nesting colonies of Penguins and Cormorants,
the young of which they devour.
American Robins. --In the Summer Aviary a pair of American
Robins has reared two young birds and the hen is sitting again. The
cock was unfortunately not to be trusted with the young of other
birds, and after devouring six baby Painted Quails he was quietly
removed from the aviary, while his mate continues to incubate, and
will, we hope, rear her second brood single-handed, unless the young of
the first brood help in the task, which is not unlikely.
Blue-birds. --Blue-birds nested in a box and have reared three
young ones, they are now building again, while another pair in the
other compartment of the aviary have a fast growing brood still in the
nest. They are delightful birds, and it is a long time since they were
regularly imported from the States. They were bred at the Zoo
several times between 1860 and 1880, and private aviculturists have
bred them. I may add that all that are reared this year will be
wanted by the Zoological Society.
Gambel's Quails. --Gambel's Quails, which bred for the first time
last year have again done so. The old pair have a brood of six or seven
chicks, and the young pair, those reared last year, are expected to hatch
any day. This Quail, it will be remembered, is something like the
Californian Quail, but to my mind more handsome. It is very rarely
imported, otherwise it would be a great favourite with aviculturists.
Various Birds Nesting.-- Gambel's White-crowned Sparrow and
the Pileated Sparrow, both have young in the nest, while Brazilian
Blue Grosbeaks are sitting. Brush Bronzewings, Crested Doves,
Barred Doves, Dwarf Turtle-doves, and Triangular-spotted Pigeons
have all reared young.
An Abnormal Rosy-faced Lovebird.--A very interesting variety
of the Rosy-faced Lovebird has been received at the Zoo with other
normal specimens. The rosy tint, which is characteristic of the cheeks,
has spread over nearly the whole of the body, so that the bird is rosy
pink over the greater part of its plumage.

M. Delacour has proposed the name of L. astleyi, in honour of the
President of our Society, and a description appeared in the Bulletin
of the British Ornithologist's Club, vol. xli, p. 115, April, 1921. One
imagines that it has yet to be proved whether it is a true species, or
only a glorified variety of L. lutevis, but it is significant that a male and
female should be coloured alike.

Sirs, --I wish to correct a note in the March number of your Magazine
re the Australian Zoological Control Board. The Government has not
prohibited the export of unprotected birds, nor have they given this
business to any individual or officials; thousands of birds for which
there is an open season are leaving Australia, and many dealers are
sending them out. The various Governments are enforcing the various
Acts for the protection of our native birds, and will not allow rare
protected birds to be sent away as hitherto. It is probable that the
Control Board will be asked to see that such of these birds as are
required for scientific institutions abroad are sent to them under the

Sirs, -- I should esteem it a favour if you could tell me how to
differentiate the sex of the Lucian Conure, as I have some, but cannot
see any difference at all.
I have had very bad luck with rare African Waxbills, every one
that I had from a certain dealer died. Violet-ears, Melbas, Black-
cheeked, Blue-breasted, Dufresnes, etc., and yet a quantity of common
Waxbills that I had from another dealer are all in perfect health,
although all received the same treatment. The former mentioned
seemed in perfect health at first, but after a few weeks seemed to pine
and die away. Do you think that it would be some infection amongst
them ? But, if it were that, you would have thought that the other
ones would have caught it, and succumbed to it, too. I should like to
know what you think about it.

Sirs,-- The recent correspondence about Scarlet Ibis in the Magazine
has prompted me to call attention to the descriptions given of the
White Ibis of South America, in the same genus, as stated in the
Royal Natural History. In vol. iv, p. 319, we read " The last genus
we have space to mention is exclusively American, and comprises the
beautiful Scarlet Ibis (Guam rubra), ranging from Northern South
America to Central America and the West Indies ; and the White
Ibis ( G . alba), which is South American . . . Both have the tips of wings
blackish ; the rest of the plumage being scarlet in the one and black
[italics mine] in the other." The word in italics ought surely to have
been white --otherwise it would make plumage all-black.
Is not the genus name Eudocimus more in general use than the above
Guara of R. N. History ?

ago I watched two of these attractive-looking birds, both of which made
the cry when excited, the crest raised ; and from the way they hopped
about near each other seemed to me to be male and female. Is there
any external difference in sexes (these two looked the same size) either
in size or plumage ?
In their voices the above species seems to me a contrast to the
Collared Jay Thrush ( G . picticollis) of China, the latter bird being
(according to those seen) remarkably silent. Is this silence of G.
picticollis due to ones seen by me being probably females ? Or is it
a less noisy species than G. leucolophus ?

<bodyText confidence="0.991836666666667" page_id="32670716"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --Mr. Portal's account of his male Cretan Chukor Partridge
assisting in making the nest rather surprises me, as I have had an
extensive experience of the Indian Chukor at liberty in this country,
and have always found his domestic virtues to be conspicuous by their
absence ; he is a bullying and unfaithful husband, and an even worse
father, for not only does he take no part in looking after the young, but
he will attack the chicks, which the hen tries to keep out of his way.
When the females were accompanied by small young the males, after a
good deal of initial quarrelling and bad language, settled down in small
parties by themselves, and did not rejoin the coveys until the latter
were nearly full grown. It would be interesting to know what share
other cock Red-legged Partridges take in the care of the young, and
also whether the cock Chukor is a better father in India than he is in
Europe ; the fact that he is found with the full-grown covey at the
beginning of the shooting season (as I think I have read in the accounts
of some Indian sportsmen) does not, in itself, prove that he has been
with them all along.

THEORIES ON DISTINGUISHING SEXES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993672742857143" page_id="32670717"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- In the Avicultural Magazine, p. 5, Miss Knobel writes
about a female Yellow-fronted Amazon and its affection towards its
mistress, stating : "Yet she was undoubtedly a hen, and this entirely
does away with the theory that male birds like women and females
men."
Personally I agree with the writer that there is nothing in that theory
as applicable to the Parrot tribe--there being too many birds which
contradict it by their attitude ; and in this connexion it is amusing
to mention that one bird known to me was on one occasion stated " to
be a male " by a supporter of the theory, and on a later occasion " to
be a female ", he not recognizing that he was being shown the same
bird on the two occasions ! But he never explained the so-called change
of sex ! As the remarks on the Blue-fronted Amazon, pp. 56, 57, were
already sent to the Editors when Miss Knobel's account appeared, and
its habits towards different human beings were intentionally omitted
(except 1. 11, p. 57) for shortness, it may be of interest to mention
now its usual behaviour towards four people : (1) a woman cousin of
of mine, disliked her very much ; (2) a man, myself, it disliked even
worse than the woman, although neither of us ever teased it, and its
dislike to me was so great that it used to strike at me with beak even
when I brought fruit to it in its cage -- consequently I always kept
at very long arm's length when it was out of its cage ; (3) with another
man, the butler there, it was the best of friends, always allowed him to
handle it in the cage (except one day in a fit of temper it unexpectedly
bit him on the thumb, but became friendly again later in the day) ;
lastly (4), with the butler who came after he left, the bird was always
friendly. What is the theorist on " the affection-showing-sex-idea"
going to make of the aforementioned facts ? The theory is like a
bucket without a bottom--" won't hold water."
As to the remark : " It is said that a practised eye can easily tell
the sexes when a pair of birds are together," p. 4, last two lines, the
following scene between two birds of prey now in the Gardens, the
Fishing Eagles ( Halicetus leucoryphus) from India, may be worth
mentioning. Soon after their arrival in August, 1920, I watched them
very carefully for some hours to see whether their sex could be

distinguished by their attitude towards each other--both being (it
seemed to me) in immature plumage ; and both the same size. After
being indifferent to each other, even when quite close, for several
hours, observations extending over several days, a hostile scene
occurred, both Eagles facing each other, the feathers on throat and
neck raised in excitement, eyes glittering and wings partly raised and
ready for flight in attack. Seeing them, then, I think most people,
except, perhaps, specialists like the Editors, would have said they were
the same sex, " because male and female would be less likely to quarrel."
However, in January, 1921, it seemed to me that one bird was grown
rather larger than the other, and was therefore a female--smaller being
a male. While on the one side a male and female in birds (and also
mammals) have usually, in my experience, agreed well together, there
have been, on the other side of the subject, cases where a male and
female have disagreed. Therefore it does not seem to me that a hard
and fast dogma can be laid down, which will stand when put to the test
by actual facts in bird (and in mammal also) life.

Nothing is more charming than a good many birds of different
sorts, running, swimming, and even flying in a state of semi-liberty,
and I always arrange to have a number as well as some mammals in
the little park of about 40 acres, all fenced by a wire-netting 8 ft. high,
with 2 ft. in the ground. To begin with the largest ones, I have four
Rheas, two white cocks and two grey hens. I had a white hen, which
died last winter in the most peculiar way ; she hit an iron post as she
was running, cut her big artery and bled to death. I was most
distressed over this accident, when H.TI. Prince Murat kindly gave me
two grey hens ; he has quite a flock of grey Rheas in his large park of
Chantbly, where they rear their young ones every year in quite a wild
state. One of my white cocks has paired with both hens, and
occasionally chases the other one ; but most of the time he allows him
to stay near the hens and there has never been any serious fight between
them. Two dozen eggs were laid in June, which are now in the
incubator.
I was obliged to put the Emus into an enclosure, as they proved rather
spiteful, especially to the mammals, and also very destructive to plants.
Cranes are, in my opinion, the best ornament to a park. I keep loose
together one cock and two hen Sarus, pairs of Manchurian, White-
necked European, and Blue-crowned Cranes, one Stanley, and a dozen
Demoiselles. So far they all agree very well together, and have not
destroyed any nest in the spring, but I am very much afraid that when

they have more settled down, after several years, and come into
breeding condition, I shall have to separate some pairs to avoid fights
in the spring. They generally keep together, with the exception of the
flock of Demoiselles and the Crowned Cranes, which stay by themselves.
These Cranes do not always keep near the water in which they sleep,
but go all over the park, and spend a good part of their time on the
higher ground. The cock Sarus is full-winged, and it is a beautiful
sight to watch him flying round and circling, which he does about
four times a day. He sometimes disappears and flies very high for as
much as half an hour, but except on one occasion he has never
alighted anywhere but in the park. As he flies he utters loud calls,
which his wives and the other Cranes answer. Some newly imported
Demoiselles are also left unpinioned, but their feathers have not grown
yet, and they still are unable to fly. I find my Cranes never touch
the trout, which are abundant in the stream and the lake.
A pair of pinioned Screamers is a good addition to the Waders'
collection. They behave exactly like Geese, and swim a good deal,
looking for their food on the lake like Water-fowl. They are quite
harmless to other birds. They feed on grass only, and in winter touch
a little meat mash. Flamingoes are delightful on the river, which is full
of freshwater shrimp and supplies them with excellent food. I was
lucky enough to receive four of them out of a consignment of twenty
sent to the Paris Museum Zoo by the city of Alexandria. My little
river being rather deep, the Flamingoes very often have to swim, and
behave exactly like swans when they search for their food under
water.
My Water-fowl were doing splendidly when, last June, an otter got
through a gate on the river, which had been pushed slightly open by
the water, and killed over thirty of my best Ducks, and even my old
breeding female Bar-headed Goose. The amount of damage one otter
can do in one night is extraordinary ; six Ducks and one Goose were
killed and more or less eaten. I have not been able, so far, to shoot or
catch this dreadful brute, but there are now no holes where it can get
through. It never caught a bird unless swimming on the water.
Fortunately I have a good many young ones which will fill the gaps
in the collection. Among these there are eight wild Muscovies, ten

Buddy Shelducks, Bahamas, Yellow-bills, Garganeys, Chilce Widgeons,
Bar-headed and Upland Geese, and some other little birds that I cannot
identify yet.
South American gallinaceous birds, Curassows and Guans, are very
nice at liberty from April to November. In winter they have to be
taken in when it is freezing, as they would loose their tender toes at the
first frost-bite. At the present moment I have three Crested Guan,
delightfully tame little birds, which stay most of the time on the
balustrade of the terrace, three Yarrels, two Alector, one Prince Albert,
one Razor-billed, and one Salvin's Razor-bill Curassows. The last
is, I believe, quite a rare species, even in skin collections ; it resembles
the common Razor-bill, but has white underparts instead of rufous,
a much smaller bill, and a longer crest. The great tameness of
Curassows allows one to have them full-winged, as they never go away,
at least, with me.
My three pairs of Spicifer and two pairs of White Peafowls keep
each in a corner, and agree rather well. Spicifer cock is very spiteful
to human beings, but not too much to birds.
Monauls, Reeves, and Silver Pheasants, Manchurian Crossoptilons,
Siamese Firebacks, have been very satisfactory at liberty, but I had
to shut in White-crested Kaleeges and Swinhoe's Pheasants, the cocks
of which were very dangerous to other Pheasants. Amhersts and Golden
have not been very good stayers ; one cock takes the advantage and
drives away the others in the spring. Anyhow, I bred twenty-one
young Amhersts from eggs found in the park, but I don't think that
more than one cock and four hens are left out of two dozen birds which
I let out last year and were still here in March.
In January I opened the door of two small aviaries in the park, where
about thirty Senegal Palm and Half-collared Doves had been kept for
three months. They all stayed very well, and scattered through the
park, and in April I began to see young ones everywhere. Australian
Crested Pigeons and common Barbary Doves were also let out in April.
They all stayed very well, but I have not noticed any young ones yet.
I also tried Parrakeets loose, which the Marquess of Tavistock very
kindly gave me. A pair of Indian Ringnecks and an Alexandrine cock
paired to an African Ringneck hen stayed very well, and have nests,

as far as I can ascertain. A pairof Red-rumpedParrakeets, after having
stayed well for three weeks, disappeared ; a few days before the hen
looked ill ; she jirobably died and then the cock went away. Of a pair
of Rosy Cockatoos, which were given liberty at the same time, the
cock went away after three days, but the hen is still here. She has taken
a strong liking to the railway station, which is just outside the j)ark,
and spends most of her time on its roof. When a train comes in she
flies to the engine, in the smoke, and stays on it even after it has started,
until it reaches a curve, about half a mile away. She then flies back
to the station.
In separate enclosures I keep a few pairs of Ducks and Geese, two
pairs of Temminck's and one pair Satyr Tragopans, a pair of Noble
Pheasants, Rufous Tinamous, some Monauls, and Wild Turkeys.
All my other birds are in outdoor or indoor aviaries.

The only Trogon that appears to be ever imported is the one from
Cuba, but there are many other species that might be kept if once
they were imported. Mr. Harold Miller, of Durban, writes of the African
IIajpalcderma narina : " I have at present an interesting study of four
Narina Trogons, local birds, all doing well, probably the only specimens
in captivity. It is a beautiful bird and easily trained and tamed--
so different to most other birds in captivity. They nest in November,
and as my birds are young and quite tame they may nest. I am feeding
them on minced (raw) meat, grasshoppers, mantis, dragon-flies, etc.,
and the crimson feathers of the body have shown no sign of changing
as a result of this unusual diet."

BREEDING THE BLACK-CAPPED LORY

By Mrs. M. A. Burgess, F.Z.S.
The pair of Black-cajrped Lories of which I am about to write came
from Lord Tavistock about a year ago, having been imported privately
in the latter part of 1919. They are a splendid pair, and took a second
prize at Newport Show in 1920, my White-rumped Lory being first.

Mrs. M. A. Burgess--Breeding the Black-capped Lory 117
I had a small side aviary built for them in my bird-room, as the cock
was growing too savage to be left in the other aviary. The nesting-
box was very large and heavy, and for safety I placed it on the floor
just for the pair to sleep in, which they always did.
On 2nd April of the present year I saw an egg just outside the box,
so I placed it inside, but the hen did not seem to sit, and I thought they
had destroyed it. On 4th May I saw another egg, and from that date
the hen sat firmly, only coming off for food. Meanwhile, the cock
defended the box and at times he was so savage that it was hardly
safe to place food into the cage. He always slept in the box. He con-
tinued to take his bath as usual; they are great bathers, not just tossing
the water over themselves, but rolling over and over in it until they
look drowned, and this takes place twice a day.
On 8th June a young bird was seen which was judged to be about
ten days old, it was covered with down of a golden colour, and looked
about the size of a day-old chicken. On 28th June another baby was
seen ; in fact, we saw the two together, and I think there is a third, as
a third egg was seen on 8th June by the side of the first chick, and the
shell of this was thrown out on 23rd June. The hen is hardly ever out
of the box, although she now comes out to bathe again, and, strange to
say, she is as perfect in feather as she was on the day she was shown at
Newport, in spite of the fact that she has been sitting and rearing a
brood. They now eat quite double the quantity of food that they did
when they only had themselves to sustain, soft food and fruit being
all that they take.
On the evening of 2nd July one baby came out of the box as I
passed, and it was the funniest mite. On the head was a clearly marked
black-cap, and the half-grown wing-feathers were brownish or greenish,
I could hardly say which. The breast feathers were like quills, but there
were no bright colours visible. The beak looked strong, and the little
fellow used quite strong language at me and appeared to have a temper
like that of his father. He was not beautiful, but sturdy and about the
size of my White-rumped Lory. I do not know whether its parents or
myself are most proud of this achievement. I should say the young
bird is about two months old.
On the morning of 28th July the bird came out again, a big,

sturdy youngster, with black cap perfect, red face, black beak and
eyes, and black or dark legs and feet. The wings are green, with some
yellow showing in them when he flaps. The back and breast feathers
are now growing, and are dark. He can climb and fly from perch to
perch, and is nearly as large as his mother. The parents are very
devoted to him, and it is comical to see him sitting between them.
I am afraid this is the only one, although my cook seems sure she saw
two. I know there were eggs since I saw them, as stated above.
Perhaps we shall find out for certain now one, at any rate, is out.

CHUKOR PARTRIDGES FROM CRETE

<bodyText confidence="0.979011130434783" page_id="32670728"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
By Major Maurice Portal, D.S.O.
In the early summer of 1920 Col. R. Meinertzhagen kindly brought
me from Crete a pair of Caccabis saxatilis ; they were tame and only
had a few feathers cut from one wing. They were pinioned permanently
in July, as they began to fly on to the top of the garden wall. They were
very tame with the gardener, and used to remain quite near him when
at work. The cock being always rather more shy than the hen, but in
bad weather both used to come into the potting shed and sit on the
flower-pots while work was going on, and roosted there at night.
Beyond water and a handful of wheat they required no attention.
About the beginning of March they showed signs of pairing, and
spent most of the day walking about together inspecting possible
nesting sites, and finally selected the root of an old fig-tree. The hen
scraped a round hole and the cock brought her a straw in his beak,
running round and round and finally throwing it over his back, when
she picked it up and put it in the nest, Avhich finally was roughly lined
with straw and dead leaves. A spell of warm weather brought on an
old rhubarb plant, some 30 yards off, and on the 25th of March they
spent all the day near it, and next day scraped out another
nest under a leaf, making free use of the straw already there, and only
adding dead leaves.
On 15th April there were ten eggs in this nest, dirty white in colour,
with faint spots of brown, and as we had 10 degrees of frost I took

five of them and replaced them with dummy eggs. The hen came and
looked and called the cock from the end of the garden and the pair
went straight away together and scraped a hole under a plant of
brussel-sprouts, 50 yards off, putting in only a few bits of dead weed,
and laid one egg the same day. I took the other five of the first nest.
She laid fourteen eggs in the second nest, which was deep and eggs
were piled on each other. I removed the top four with a spoon, but
the hen came and looked, and again called the cock, and went off.
That afternoon it was cold and dull and they came into the potting-
shed and made a scrape in the soil by the gardener's feet as he worked,
and laid one egg in it under the potting-bench. They had for the first
time suddenly shown a fondness for seed-beds, and had cleared a bed
of seedling lettuce, onions, and something else, so I roughly enclosed
some grass outside where the bee-hives were, and the gardener opened
the garden door and they went to their new home. A few days later
a new nest was made under a dock, and finally fifteen eggs were laid.
Incubation commenced about 23rd May, and twelve hatched about
6th June. The enclosure was suitable owing to ants' nests and shelter
from a wall, so the gardener only fed on seeds and gave water. The
young were always bad to see and worse to catch, as, if frightened at all,
they squatted and did not move a fraction. The cock always seemed
to be with them, except once when both were with them on the border.
The cock was chiefly noticed on the nest during incubation, but we
never went oftener than once a day. I had to go to London on business
on 5th July, whien the chicks were three weeks old, and returned on
9th July to see ten flying some 200 yards in a flight and over garden
walls and tree-tops.
Haines, the gardener, to whom all credit of success is due, as he has
had sole care of them, informed me that on 6th July he had gone to
look at a hive of bees and saw the hen Chukor with seven or eight young
not two days old. I regret I cannot be positive that I saw her oil the
nest which hatched the twelve, and can only assume that the cock
did nearly all the incubation, and the hen started a new and fourth
nest, which up to date I have not found in the grass, so I do not know
how many eggs she laid in it. The ten young alive of the third nest
are always with the cock, and he keeps them away from the hen and

her younger lot, but should he meet these he attacks at once. This
gives the following number of eggs :--
On 15th April : 10 eggs laid, 9 fertile and hatched under Bantam.
On 3rd May : 15 eggs laid (14 in nest and one in potting-shed),
all fertile.
By 23rd May : a Chukor was sitting on 15 eggs, all fertile (but 3 left
in nest), hatched about 12th June.
On 6th July : the lien found with 7 or 8 young birds a day or so
old.
If the Chukor in Crete make a habit of laying like this the breed
should not become extinct, as, at the least, this is forty-seven or forty-
eight eggs laid and of these only one was unfertile.
The birds with their parents develop quickest, and are strongest,
but it should be remembered that they have had no cold weather, and
lots of ant heaps. My birds under Bantams did badly until allowed com-
plete freedom of range, and then the usual losses started ; a bird got
in a ditch ; a dog frightened the lot one day, and they ran and flew
in every direction, three never came back, two got trodden on, etc. I
fed on hard-boiled egg and dry chick-feed ; later small seeds from the
threshing machine, which contained very small wheat and much dirt,
but at 10s. cwt. was well worth it, and better than dry chick-feed.
I added oatmeal if they did not feed up well, and ants' nests when I
could dig them -- for the latter they will eat out of my hand.
The young are very shy if you move, and have a bad habit of running
a long way and squatting until the hen calls. Cold rain or cold wind
they dislike, unless under the lee of something. They drink freely at
night, but rarely in the day-time, and when they do drink do so for
some minutes.
The young will walk up anything like a post or log resting up against
the netting and are always trying to get out, and having accomplished
this they at once try to get back again. They develop faster than
Red-leg Partridges, and fly much earlier on in life ; the call is somewhat
like that of the Red-leg ( C. rufa), and if a mound of logs is built in the
enclosure they will soon be on the top calling, flying down into the
grass at the least disturbance and five minutes later up on the top again.
If anyone should try these birds, I would suggest an enclosure of

illustrating this number of the Avicultural Magazine we are indebted
to our distinguished and esteemed member, Monsieur J. Delacour,
who has kindly placed it at our disposal under circumstances already
explained in an earlier issue of the Magazine. It represents Verreaux's
Glossy Starling ( Pholidauges verreauxi), a rare and beautiful bird
apparently comparatively recently imported to Eurojm for the first
time. A short note about the species was published by Mr. Seth-Smith
in our Magazine last February on the occasion of the jDresentation of
a specimen to the Zoological Society by Mr. Harold Miller, the
Superintendent of the Zoological Gardens, Durban.
With the admirable plate before us it is needless to describe the
bird. It is needless, too, to enter into the question as to whether it
should rank as a distinct species or merely as a local race or sub-
species of its northern and better-known relative, the White-bellied
Glossy Starling ( Pholidauges leucogaster), a representative of which
was presented to the Zoological Society for the first time in 1906 by
Dr. ILopkinson, D.S.O., who brought it from the Gambian Province of
West Africa.
Verreaux's Glossy Starling does not apparently occur in Cape
Colony ; but on the western side of Africa it ranges from Damaraland
to the Congo, where it meets the White-bellied Glossy Starling, and
on the eastern side it goes as far north as Zanzibar, its southern limit
being Natal, Zululand, and the Transvaal. In the southern districts
of its range, at all events, it is migratory to a certain extent. In
Damaraland, for example, the species arrives on the approach of the

rainy season, but gradually leaves as the country dries up, a few
only staying behind to pick up a precarious living. Similarly the bird
is by no means rare in Natal in the autumn and winter, when it may
be seen almost invariably in flocks, consisting entirely of either male
or female birds. Towards spring they appear to migrate to the north,
although in that province apparently, as in the Transvaal, some
individuals are resident throughout the year. These facts point to
tropical Africa as the original home of the species.
Their food consists principally of berries and other small fruit
and insects, particularly the flying termites, which are captured on
the wing. The nest is made in holes in trees or other natural hollows,
which are lined with wool and feathers, over which green leaves,
periodically renewed, are placed. The usual number of eggs is four.

Mr. J. D. La Touche, who has recently returned from Yunnan, kindly
brought for the Zoological Society two birds, which have certainly
never previously been exhibited in the Gardens, and have probably
never before been imported to Europe alive. One is the so-called
Finch-billed Bulbul (Spmixus canifrons), which earns its trivial name
from its short, thick, almost shrike-like bill, very different from that
of the typical Bulbuls. It is, indeed, very doubtful if the bird is in
reality a Bulbul, although commonly classified with them. Mr. E. W.
Oates suggests that its position will probably be found hereafter to be
_ among the Sibias and White-eyes. The crest on the head is long and
thick, and the nostrils are partially concealed by small feathers.
Three species only appear to be known, two of them inhabiting China,
while the third, the one under notice, occurs in Yunnan and the hills
of Assam. It has the forehead and front part of the crown ashv-
grey--whence the name canifrons -- the rest of the crown and lores
black, the cheeks blackish with greyish-white tips to the feathers ;
the ear coverts pale-brown ; sides of the neck streaked with black ;
throat very dark brown ; upper plumage and wing coverts green ;
the wings dark brown, with the outer webs greenish-yellow; the
tail also is greenish-yellow, with the tip black ; the underside yellow

or yellowish. Nothing appears to be known of the habits of this
interesting bird to explain the powerfully developed bill.
The other bird represents the species called by Oates the White-
winged Myna (Sturnia nemoricola), which he records from Pegu and
Tenasserim. It is closely allied to the common Malabar Myna (Sturnia
or Paliopsar malabarica ), but differs principally in having the winglet,
or bastard wing, and the primary wing-coverts entirely or in part
white in the newly moulted adult instead of black. The two species,
how r ever, appear to be very much alike when immature, and even
after reaching maturity, when the plumage is faded and worn. It nests
at the same time of the year, that is to say, in May and June, as the
Malabar Myna, and has similar eggs.
Mr. La Touche also sent to the Zoological Society at the same
time an example of the Great Eagle Owl, which he tells me in his
letter he believes to be the representative of aii undescribed local race.

Sirs, --In reply to Mr. Meade-Waldo's inquiry in the May number

Sirs, --I have lately secured a nice specimen of the African Marsh
Owl, Asio capensis, a quietly coloured but very pretty bird, with full,
soft plumage in dusky browns and greys, wings tipped and barred, with
tawny yellow and tail the same. The face is paler grey and very round,
the eyes look black, but are really mahogany coloured, and being set
in dark feathers look larger than they really are. The legs and feet are

closely feathered, claws black. Beak short and strong, also black.
My specimen is a fierce little creature, and hisses defiance at anyone who
comes near, she also utters a snarling croak, reminding one of a creaking
door.
Mr. Meade Waldo says : " I know the Marsh Owl ivell. I lived for
years close to the wild ones in Morocco, but never managed to get a
living bird. They nest in the wettest part of the great marshes late
in the summer, when it is very hot, and the whole country a mass of
mosquitoes. They are diurnal, very strong on the wing, catch fish and
frogs, also voles, young ducks, etc. I have never seen one in the
market, and I never shot one, though I often could have done so ;
it looks a big bird on the wing ... It occurs sparingly in the South
of Spain. The Marsh Owl does not hoot, it gives a loud " squack ",
It prefers far wetter ground than the Short-eared Owl and you never
see it anywhere else."
My specimen is about the size of a Short-eared Owl, will eat rabbit,
but prefers feather to fur. I think it is a female.

Sirs, --I have lately added to my collection another sjiecies of the
African Robin-chats, known under the rather absurd name of
" vociferous " or " noisy " Robin-chat. An extremely handsome bird,
with upper parts dark grey, chin, breast and underparts bright rich
chestnut; from the beak, encircling the eyes and spreading over the
ears and cheeks, black ; the tail, central feathers, dark grey ; outer
ones, chestnut, and upper tail-coverts chestnut. The bird is the size
of the better-known Cape Robin-chat ( C. caffra), but is slightly stouter
in build. As to his noisiness, I have not heard it, but I have listened to a
very sweet song. The bird arrived in almost faultless condition from
Africa, where the species is found in Cape Colony and Natal, etc.
All the Cossyphos would make pleasant cage-birds and there are
many species, several of which are inhabitants of Uganda and British

Sirs, -- I have just succeeded in breeding the Yellow-billed Cardinal.
So far as I am aware this is the only occasion upon which this species
has been bred in captivity. Three young left the nest, but only one has
survived to be completely independent of its parents. This young
bird, still in juvenile plumage, has been seen, and the nest inspected,
by Mr. Wesley T. Page. The old birds are now busy nesting again.
I will send an account of this happy event to the " Avicultural " in the
course of a few days, meanwhile I am putting in a formal claim for
a medal.

THE LIFE OF PROFESSOR NEWTON 1

The name of Professor Newton has long been and will long remain
a household word amongst ornithologists, not only in this country, but
throughout the world, for he was one of the leading ornithologists of
his time and his work will remain a model of what ornithological
investigation and literature should be. His Dictionary of Birds alone is
a masterpiece, every page testifying to the great knowledge and careful
work of its author and containing a mine of information. For upwards
of fifty years Alfred Newton held the chair of Zoology and Comparative
Anatomy at Cambridge University, and during all those years he never
lost an opportunity of helping and encouraging such of the under-
graduates as were interested in ornithology, and to his help and teaching

is clue the fact that quite a number of brilliant ornithologists were
produced from Cambridge during that period. It is very fitting that
one of these pupils of his should have been chosen to write the story
of his life, which has just been published. There has been a good deal
of delay in producing the volume, for Newton died in 1907, but
Dr. Wollaston, himself an eminent naturalist, has during the interval
been engaged for a period of years in exploration work in New Guinea
and elsewhere, not to mention the further delay caused by the great
upheaval of the war, in which his services were required in other
directions. But now that the book has appeared, it is well worth the
waiting for, and ornithologists in common with others will find very
much of interest in its pages.
Newton made it his habit to keep practically every letter he received,
and apparently many of his correspondents kept the letters they received
from him, so that his biographer has been able to publish a large
number of the most important out of some thousands of these letters,
and these, give perhaps a better insight into his life and character than
could otherwise have been obtained. Every chapter is of absorbing-
interest, whether it relates to the Great Auk and his visit to its former
breeding places, to Darwinism, or the founding of the B.O.U. and the
Ibis in Newton's rooms at Cambridge. In every chapter we obtain
an insight into the character of one who was of the best type of English
gentleman of the mid-Victorian period, a man of the most upright
principles, of strong opinions, and a staunch conservative who hated
what he regarded as new-fangled ideas, such as the creation of sub-
species and the employment of trinomials in nomenclature, though,
surely, had he lived long enough, he would have come to recognize
the necessity of these. In spite of his dislike of new ideas, he was one of
the first to recognize and approve of the views of Darwin.
Professor Newton was an Honorary Member of the Aviculturai
Society, and the present writer cherishes a letter written by him in
reply to an invitation to become an honorary member. It is in the
Professor&apos;s usual courteous style, and expresses appreciation of the
work achieved by the Society and what he describes as the honour
it was proposed to confer upon him.

Part XI of this very useful work is to hand, and deals with the
Osprey, Vultures, Storks, Herons, Spoonbills, Ibis, Flamingo, and the
family Anatidae, the Swans, Geese, and Ducks. In addition to some
excellent text-figures, this part contains a very useful coloured plate
showing the bills of the two British Wild Swans and the Geese, a valuable
aid to identification.
This work when completed will contain the most up-to-date
information on all the birds on the British list, and should be in the
hands of every student of this branch of Natural History.

Apart from the usual notes upon the habits and local occurrence
of British birds, the two last numbers of this periodical contain three
particularly interesting articles upon " Nesting Ringed Plovers ", by
T. Leslie Smith, illustrated by five photographs ; upon " Diving Ducks
on the Coast of Western Canada ", by C. E. Alford ; and upon " The
Little Tern and its Young ", by J. N. Douglas Smith, who assisted
his brother in his observations upon the Ringed Plover in the article
already mentioned. Mr. Alford's article upon diving Ducks deals
principally with the Harlequin, Golden-eye, and Red-breasted
Merganser. The courtship of the Golden-eye is very amusingly
described, and the record of the manner in which the Gulls of the
district, principally the Glaucous-winged Gull (Larus glaucescens),
watch for the rising Ducks to rob them of their captured prey, as told
in the July number, is independently confirmed in the August issue by
Mr. Theed Pearse, writing from Courtney, Vancouver. In this number
also Mr. Hugh S. Gladstone raises the interesting question of the date
of the introduction of the Ring-necked Pheasant into Western Europe.
This bird, he says, is not believed to have been brought to this country

By The Marquess of Tavistock
It is one of the most obvious and well-known facts in the world
that no two human beings are exactly alike, and while one could
hardly venture to assert that no two beasts or birds are exactly alike,
the fascination of keeping animals in captivity and of studying them
in a wild state consists largely in observing the difference in character
and disposition between individuals of the same species. Nine hundred
and ninetyinine may display the same trait, and yet there is always
the chance that the thousandth may be a most striking exception to
the rule.
All who have kept large ruminants know that it is a certainty that
an adult male Deer of any species will be exceedingly dangerous in the
breeding season, if he has lost his fear of man, yet there is one authentic
record of a Red Stag--and a master Stag, too--who could be safely
bandied by his owner at all times of year, and there is also a record
of an equally amiable Fallow Buck. What is true of mammals is
equally true of birds ; most owners of large collections of Cranes and
waterfowl can supply instances of individual wild Geese which have
developed an intense and quite unreciprocated passion for individual
Cranes. I can remember a Brent Goose which fell in love with a
Whooping Crane and a Ross' Snow Goose which attached itself to a
pair of Sarus. It is not the normal habit of Geese to take an interest
in Cranes, but there is a certain type of Goose mentality to which a
Crane makes an irresistible appeal; how interesting it would be to
know why ! Cranes, also, may be the victims of an abnormal and

The Marquess of Tavistock -- On Individuality
unrequited affection. I once knew a female Common Crane who
attached herself to a breeding pair of Sams ; she did not want to
oust the hen Sams from the affections of her mate ; she just wanted
to live with the two. The Sams were bored by her company and
frequently told her so, but she was impervious to hints, even delivered
at the point of the beak ! When the Sams made a nest she proceeded
to lay an egg in it, which she incubated whenever the Sarus would
let her, for, with the strange lunacy of birds in such matters, they
adopted the egg and laid none of their own. Finally we removed the
Common Crane and her egg, and the Sarus made another nest, laid,
and brought up a family.
Then, too, I once owned a Yellow-bellied Parrakeet, whose domestic
life and morals were for the whole of one summer a public scandal.
One of the leading characteristics of the entire broad-tail family is
the strict and lasting fidelity of the male bird to his mate, a fidelity
which is at once an example and reproach to the males of certain other
bipeds--notably humans and ducks. But this particular yellow-belly
was a most notorious exception to the general rule. He lived at liberty
and being without a mate of his own kind he paired with a female
Port Adelaide--a closely related, species. When spring came round
the Adelaide nested in a hollow tree, and according to the usual custom
of her family disappeared from view. A few days later, to my surprise
and disappointment, I saw the yellow-belly courting a hen Blue-bonnet
that I had just turned out in an enclosure with a cut wing. This
appeared to point to but one conclusion--the Adelaide was dead and
the yellow-belly a widower. Not long afterwards, however, we saw
the Adelaide and we realized that we were dealing with a confirmed
rake. The yellow-belly never fed his sitting wife but spent all his
time with the Blue-bonnet, in spite of the fact that she gave him no
encouragement. The poor Adelaide carried on fairly well until the
young hatched, when the unnatural strain proved too much for
her, and like the heroine of an early Victorian novel, she fell into decline
and died and her unhappy family perished with her. The tragedy
caused the yellow-belly no concern ; he had already persuaded a hen
Rosella to marry him, but when she went to nest he deserted her for
a newly imported Brown's, and ended the season by marrying a young

Adelaide--a bird of the year ; it is only fair to him to add that next
season he lived a fairly reputable life, and even brought up a child of
his own. Then came the war; the birds were neglected and the
yellow-belly and others disappeared--so I cannot say whether the
reformation would have been lasting.
At present in my collection I have another bird of abnormal
character--a code Redrump. I have had many Redrumps--including
several pairs at liberty. The cocks, without exception, have been
faithful and devoted husbands and very good stayers, but if ever
a hen Redrump met with a fatal accident her mate, after a few days
of anxious, fruitless calling, invariably departed and was never heard
of again alive. I therefore learned this lesson--if you lose one of a
pair of Redrumps at any time of the year replace it at once or else
catch up the survivor. Last year I bought a cock Redrump as a mate
for a hen that seemed anxious to nest. He was rather fat and " soft"
when he arrived and did not seem particularly interested in the nest-
box, but he settled down before long and eggs were laid in due course.
About this time a hen Blue-bonnet in another aviary laid three eggs
and then got ill, and I put the eggs in the Redrump's nest along with their
own. The Redrump's eggs all proved clear, but the Blue-bonnet's
hatched. One youngster died in the nest, the others flew, and the cock
Redrump showed hi m self a most devoted foster-father. But about
this time I noticed he was becoming exceedingly short with his wife--
in fact, he wmuld hardly allow her to come out of the nest-box. The
hen Redrump, however, made the best of a bad job, by laying another
clutch, which, like the first, proved clear. After that I took the nest-
box away, and soon afterwards gave the entire family--reduced to
three b} 7 the death of another Blue-bonnet--their liberty. From that
time onward the cock Redrump wmuld have nothing more to do with
the hen and associated entirely with his adopted daughter, and if the
hen Redrump tried to join them she was promptly driven away. At
the beginning of winter I broke up the alliance by sending both Red-
rumps to an aviary in the Isle of Wight. Here, apparently 7 , the cock
became reconciled to his first mate, but when nesting-time came she
unluckily died egg-bound. Some little time later I had him sent back
to me and turned him into the aviary where he had nested the year

before, providing him with a new lien. He was very much in breeding
condition and far more fit than in the previous spring, but he was by
no means gracious to the fresh arrival, and a little inclined to bully her.
When they seemed on more friendly terms I released them, but the
cock took no trouble to keep in touch with his partner, and being rather
a wild bird she strayed and was lost. There was, at that time, an
unmated hen Blue-bonnet in one of the aviaries, but the Redrump
took no interest in her, and as he was calling and displaying all day
long I feared he would leave, and caught him on the trap feeding-
tray and put him into his aviary again ; a few minutes later I saw him
making his exit; we had forgotten to tack up the hole through which
the pair had been released ! After that I left him to his own devices
and tried to procure a third female. Every day 1 expected to find him
gone, but days became weeks and weeks months, and still he
stayed ; he spent nearly all his time in a neighbouring garden, amusing
himself by chasing sparrows -- an unusual pastime, for parrakeets at
liberty absolutely ignore small birds, as indeed they also do when
properly kept in big aviaries ; if a parrakeet is dangerous with finches,
in nine cases out of ten the owner is originally to blame for bad manage-
ment. At last the hen arrived and I turned her into an aviary. The
cock absolutely ignored her, and it was plain that a bachelor existence
entirely satisfied him. After a considerable time I turned her out
and she has stayed all right, but as a pair they are a failure--he goes
one way and she goes another. They do not quarrel when they meet,
but, rather to my surprise, she proves to be the master. I wonder
what will happen when spring comes round again--will the hermit
relent or will he continue his sparrow-hunting ?
Though a less marked possessor of individual peculiarities, a cock
Brown's Parrakeet has sufficient character to vex me and send my
best-laid breeding schemes agley. He is a rather old bird, and in
an aviary a failure at producing a family, so this spring I gave him
and his mate their liberty ; he v r as much attached to the latter, but
tragedy was in store, for while prospecting for a nest she descended
a chimney and starved to death in the unoccupied room below, through
the carelessness of my servants, who had been specially v T arned of
this danger. I obtained another hen, but although she stayed well

and the two were quite friendly, it was evident, as time went on, that
there was something not quite right. Though often together, they
were also often apart, and the cock Brown's did not display that
pugnacity towards other Parrakeets which is usually associated with an
entirely happy marriage. They did, indeed, do a little house-hunting
in a perfunctory sort of way, and the hen tried to repeat her pre-
decessor's exploit, but was rescued in time. There was an unmated
cock Brown's in one of the aviaries in whom the hen began to take
more and more interest, but the final breach came when a cock Yellow-
mantle died or disappeared, leaving a widow and family. A very
short time later the cock Brown's married her and took over the care
of her brood, and from that time on he not only ignored the hen but
drove her away when she came near. Fate, however, has interposed.
I have caught up and removed the Rosellas and given the aviary
Brown's a mate. So the old cock has returned to his first partner
with a very ill grace, for there is no getting away from it,
temperamentally they don't suit each other--again, why ?

NESTING NOTES ON THE YELLOW-BILLED
CARDINAL (PARO ARIA CAPITATA)

require a detailed description of its plumage to be given here, but
roughly it differs from the Pope Cardinal, its nearest imported relative,
by its smaller size, black instead of carmine throat, and darker back.
A full description, together with an excellent plate, appears in
Dr. Butler's Foreign Finches in Captivity, p. 68. The sexes, according
to this author, are alike, but I have no difficulty whatever in fixing the
sex difference so far as my pair are concerned, though whether or no
these distinctions are constant I cannot say. In my birds the hen is
very slightly but quite noticeably smaller and slimmer; the white of
the underparts is also of a much purer colour in the cock.

134 Capt. G. Rattigan -- Nesting Notes on the Yellow-hilled Cardinal
On leaving nest the plumage is roughly as follows : Above, greyish;
the feathers of the back tipped light brown ; head, dark greyish-
brown ; sides of head, rufous ; throat, same colour, but of a paler,
more washed-out tint, a sort of fawn which extends slightly into the
breast; sides of neck, pure white, tapering to the nape, where it
merges into the greyish-brown of the back ; wing coverts and tail
feathers, black ; feet, light brown ; bill, upper mandible, blackish-
brown, under, light horn colour ; the thighs show no trace of the black
of the adult.
Clutch. --Three. Eggs olive-green, densely streaked Avith dark
(amber) brown. Size appears to be about the same as that of the
Red-crested Cardinal, and large for the size of the bird.
Nest. -- Very compact and strongly made, and composed of the
wing twigs of the maidenhair bush, lined with a little fine grass and
pampas grass. The nest exactly resembles that of the Red-crest's
built in the same aA&apos;iar}^, and is composed of practically the same
materials, save that the Red-crests added a little coAV-hair as an inner
lining, but it is much more strongly and compactly put together.
Incubation period thirteen days, and young left nest in thirteen days.
Fending for itself. -- Commenced to pick up tit-bits on its oavii on
the eleAmnth day after quitting the nest, and Avas entirely on its oavii
two days later. Commenced to eat coached hemp and sunflower seeds
fifteen days after lea\ r ing the nest, and Avas actually singing on the
3rd July, or tAventy-three days from leaving the nest.
Song . -- The song of these birds I find quite pleasing, but very weak
and Ioav, and whilst the hen Avas incubating the cock frequently regaled
her with Avhat might be termed a " AA liisper " song. This song Avas
sometimes quite inaudible, to human ears at any rate, but Avas accom-
panied by a rather envious display, during which the cock raises the red
feathers at the crown of the head, and spreads out the feathers of the
tail like a fan. Incidentally I note that Butler, in the Avork already
referred to, states that this bird cannot raise the red feathering on the
head at will. This is, however, incorrect, for the cocks, at any rate,
can and frequently do raise these feathers when excited. The young
bird, which is very tame, often displays to me in this Avav, generally
after he has had his ration of mealworms, and I have no doubt it

Dr. E. Hopkinson--The Yellow-backed Whydah 135
forms part of the ordinary sexual display. While I consider this
species to be quite the most charming and attractive of the Cardinals,
I find it extremely pugnacious for its size, especially as might be
expected when breeding. It is fond, like its larger relative the Red-
crest, of hotly pursuing smaller and weaker birds, whose every twist
and turn it will follow, being very rapid and dexterious on the wing.
I believe this practice is indulged in more for the sport of the thing
and as a form of exercise than anything else, but still I personally would
not dream of confining the species with any of the smaller Finches or
Waxbills. It agrees quite well with the Red-crested and Green
Cardinals, which mostly ignore it, but in my experience cannot be
safely enclosed with Pope Cardinals.
Rearing .--For the first three days the young birds were fed entirely
upon a diet of green fly, long-legged spiders, and small caterpillars.
After this the menu was gradually modified, until after the first week
they were entirely on a diet of hard-boiled egg and tea-biscuit,
supplemented with a few mealworms supplied every three hours
throughout the day. It would, however, be probably possible to
raise them entirely on the latter diet if supplied with discretion. In
my experience the most dangerous period for young birds (insectivorous)
is just after they have left the nest, when they almost always seem to
be attacked by diarrhoea in a greater or lesser degree. Why this
should be so is a mystery to me, but I have found that powdered
cuttle-fish sprinkled over the egg-food tends to lessen the danger.
This idea was given to me some years back by my Red-vented Bulbuls,
which I noticed always used to give cuttle-fish liberally to their young,
when the latter were about 6 or 7 days old, and these birds
hardly ever lost a chick.

THE YELLOW-BACKED WHYDAH
</sectionHeader>
<reference confidence="0.206312">
(Coliuspasser macrourus (Gm.))
By Dr. E. Hopkinson
This bird is a native of Tropical Africa, ranging through West
(Senegambia to Angola), Equatorial, and East Africa. The Gambia
must be very near the northern limit of its western range, and here

it is certainly more common to the south than to the north of the river,
and apparently never extends more than, say, 40 or 50 miles inland.
Even in Kombo, where it is more or less plentiful, it is a very local
bird, and never found far from the mangroves.
After an interval of a good many years I have once more got one
of these birds, caught in Niumi at a jfiace called Tubab Kolong, almost
on the same day and almost on the same spot where I saw my first
Niumi bird thirteen years ago. I have looked up my old diaries and
the notes I used to keep in former years on my birds, when T had more
time, and also, I suppose, more inclination. These give certain details
about these birds both in wild life and captivity, which may be of
interest. One thing they seem to show is that the date at which the
males come into colour varies with the age of the bird (as observation
abroad also seems to indicate), and that this change may be delayed
(and sometimes perhaps advanced) bv various causes, such as captivity
or the change from freedom to captivity.
I will commence with extracts from my old Gambia bird-diaries :--
1902. June. Have five among the three cages of small birds I am
taking home. One has yellow shordders and dark wings,
the others are quite off colour, and look like large out-of-
colour Bishops, but have a more greenish tinge than these.
I had one other cock with more yellow, but it died within
twenty-four hours. They were all caught in Kombo close to
Bathurst.
1906. Jan. I think I found old nests of this bird in the swamp at
Nianimaru. (1919. A J o. I now know that the nests were those
of the Crimson-crowned Bishop.)
1907. May 27. Near the Cape (Kombo) I saw a nearly black bird
with yellow shoulder-patches attended by two uncoloured
blackish birds ; they were the size of a " Kaffir Finch ", which
at first I thought they were, and later Caterpillar-catchers
(which I only know from descriptions).
June 18. Saw another at Tuba-Kolong in Niumi; very like the
first bird, but not so much black.
June 25. Essau, Niumi. Saw another, half black and with
shoulders (not back), yellow. No long tail. I think these must

Dr. E. Hopkinson--The Yellow-backed Whydah 137
be Pyromelana. (? Have we a " Kaffir Finch ", P. capensis,
here ?)
1908. July. Saw definite Y.B. Whydahs occasionally near Bakau
(Niumi).
1909. May 11. Gunjur. Saw a single bird exactly like the 1907
birds. Half colour (general weaver-look and black like a
Bishop), and with the yellow confined to the shoulder ; back
still speckly. Got quite close to this bird.
May 15. Kartong (southern border of Kombo). Saw several
more of these birds in the dry, now quite sandy, rice-fields.
Tails do not seem long enough for Yellow-backed Whydahs ;
they suggest to me the Urobrachya plate in the B.M. catalogue,
but the shoulder-patch is a bright gold yellow. During the
next few days I remained at Kartong and saw plenty of these
birds on the rice-fields or the dry sandy flats covered with
coarse grass and low straggly thorns, behind the mangroves
along the Allahin River. Here they were feeding on the ground
with other Weavers and Waxbills, in pairs, or more commonly
in threes, one showing yellow and black, the other two in
brown plumage and presumably hens. They were very tame
for Weaver birds and only flew at one's close approach, and then
only to the nearest bush, returning at once to the feeding-place
as we moved on. The males were about half-coloured (I saw
none in full colour), and the yellow was entirely confined to the
shoulders.
1916. August. Yellow-backed Whydahs quite common at the Cape
during the rains. They nest in the rough grass among the
mangroves which border the numerous creeks. At this season
one sees the males very commonly, but the females rarely.
I think that there is usually only one wife, but occasionally
I feel sure that one male (perhaps a cocksure young one) has two
establishments to look after. There is no nesting in company
like the Bishops, and I have never seen one male driving another
as is so common among the Crimson-crowned Bishops, which
nest in much the same places, but in larger numbers, so that the
males are continually coming into collision with each other over
fancied trespasses.

138 Dr. E. Hopkinson -- The Yellow-hacked Wlvydah
I know now that the Gunjur birds were these Whydahs and
that the yellow always commences on the shoulders, the back
colour coming very late. This year I was able to watch the
complete change from half-colour in June to full colour (in
most) by the end of July. A few, however, though obviously
nesting, were neither completely black nor yellow-backed even
in August.
About 1910 I had thirty-six of these birds, mostly cocks
in half colour. They were all in one cage, and had all been
caught in Kombo. I only got them a few days before sailing
for home (end of July). The luggage was loaded into a lighter
to go off to the steamer, the birds among them--a tornado,
the whole covered with a tarpaulin, so thoroughly that all the
live-stock was suffocated. A great catastrophe. I should have
liked to get home three dozen Yellow-backed Whydahs.
1918. These Whydahs are quite common in Kombo during the rains,
and odd ones may be seen all the year round. Nearly all the
males keep the yellow shoulders all the year round. On the
Cape road one sees them in full colour from the end of July
to about October. They never appear to like to stray far
from mangroves, and at the end of the dry season seem content
with brackish water for drinking, like our " Black Pigeons
In Niumi they also breed, but are certainly less common
there than in Kombo.
1921. Tubab Kolong. June 17. Caught one half-colour cock, and
saw a few others. Shoulders yellow, a few speckles of black
below and wing feathers dark. Brought him home. Now
(July 26) the throat is black and the black speckles are in-
increasing in size everywhere. The wildest bird of this kind
I have ever had.
So much for the wild life ; the remaining notes refer to
those I have kept : --
1902. Brought five from Gambia, July, 1902. No. 1 was showing
a little j^ellow and had dark wings, the other four were quite off
colour. Turned into aviary with No. 5, the rest in cage indoors.

tinge over the plumage. All in perfect condition now. (? Have
they moulted?)
Sept. 20. No. 1 now in full colour. A handsome but not very
lively bird ; very keen on insects, thus differing from the
Paradise Whydahs and resembling the Bishops. Has looked
rather bad at times, but now that he is in full colour seems
better.
The others I am nearly sure are young cocks. No. 5 is
growing a long tail, but shows no sign of either black or yellow,
and I have seen two of the others " sing " ; they also seem to
be getting a bit speckly about the face.
Oct. 12. No. 1 still in aviary and in full colour. All tail-feathers
now of the same length, at first the two middle ones were the
longest.
Nov. 12. Ifo. 1 still full colour and in perfect condition. Nos. 2
and 3 are now at Oxford.
All both sing and dance like Bishops, and are rather quarrel-
some, especially with each other.
Nov. 20. No. 1 found insensible and moribund on the floor of
the aviary after a very cold night. Brought indoors to the fire
and given brandy ; to everyone's surprise recovered. Kept
indoors in cage to himself.
Dec. 11. In No. 2 (Oxford) one yellow feather has appeared on
one shoulder. Have not felt the intense cold, though we have
had 10 to 15 degrees of frost.
Dec. 18. A few yellow feathers on each shoulder now of No. 2.
Does not look quite so fit. Very keen on mealworms.
Dec. 24. No. 1 still indoors. Full colour, perfect condition. All
black with brown edges to flights ; the yellow extends over
whole upper back and shoulders.
Nos. 4 and 5 still in Brighton aviary ; yellow showing on
the shoulders of both and in one the wings are getting black.

of chest.

Mar. 31. Browner. Now beginning to shed tail. Yellow, I think,
much the same. Lively and fit.

Had there been others I do not think it would have been safe
to turn him out as he is very spiteful with other Whvdahs, but
inoffensive to smaller birds.
April 17. Still in aviary. Nearly all brown ; back brown, but
shoulders still yellow. All tail lost now ; there are now only
a few short feathers, the new tail.
May 13. Hardly more than a speck of yellow now showing on
each shoulder, but he has grown a new tail, a brown one. Is
now, I suppose, in complete out-of-colour plumage. Very fit.
Aug. 13. In nearly full colour again ; nearly all black, though
still a few brown feathers among the yellow on back.
Oct. 8. Still in aviary. Perfect condition. Have turned out one
of the other Whydahs ; they agree.
Oct. 24. Occasionally tremendous battles between the two
Whydahs, but apparently no harm done.
This morning this bird fell doum in a fit (rigidity and stupor
and almost " light "). Brandy and castor-oil; fire. Revived
and in the afternoon ate a spider.
Oct. 26. Head. A similar attack to his first, but with a different
ending.

short.

Dec. 1. No^ about half-colour.
1904. Absent in Gambia.
1905. April. Still in aviary on my return. Out of colour, but with
still some yellow. Very fit.
June 16. Half-colour again. Indoors in cage, as in the aviary
he is non compos and generally lies on the ground gasping or
darts wildly about. In cage seems perfectly well.
Aug. 10. In full colour and perfect condition. Turned out again.
Sept. 12. Seems quite to have got over his illness. Still full

All these birds walk on the ground like other Whydahs, but
at times hop as well.
April 7. Died. " Shoulders yellow, wings black, rest brown, even

All the above birds and nearly all the others I have had turned
out to be males. In freedom, too, the females seem much more retiring
than the males, and less often seen than the males, even if every
allowance is made for the absence of colour.
Query, is there any simple reason which can account for so many
more males than females being caught ?
There is as yet no record of this bird having been bred in captivity.
In Butler's Foreign Finches is a good coloured plate, at least of the
male, though that of the hen does not attract.
Other coloured figures are given by Russ ( Fremdlandischen Slubcn-

<bodyText confidence="0.950038052631579" page_id="32670759"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
A weird " moo-moo " sound, more subdued than that of a cow
or calf, is often heard at night-time in the Queensland bush, and there
are wide differences of opinion, even among bushmen, as to the source of
the sound, which is regarded by many with superstitious awe. A
recent controversy in the North Queensland Register, of Townsville,
does not seem to have completely solved the mystery, though it has
narrowed down the sound to one emanating from some member of
the animal creation. Some say snakes, others owls, and others again
mopokes, rats, porcupines, or quails. The balance of opinion is in
favour of a light-grey variety of quail, which usually haunts rosewood
scrub. Yet a naturalist whose word carries weight in Queensland
writes :--
" The quail's call note is easily recognizable, but the forest night
noise is different and a much lower sound, repeated more rapidly
than the quail's call. You may approach the night noise stealthily,
and then fire a gun or make a noise that woidd scare away any bird ;
then retreat quietly, and the noise commences again in the same place,
" M M M ". Many people of the bush make pets of quails, and their
note is well known."

aZEBRA finches at liberty
By the Marquess of Tavistock
About ten years ago I tried an experiment with various Australian
Finches at liberty; Gouldians and Parrot Finches were a failure, but I did
succeed in breeding Zebra Finches, Rufous-tailed Grass Finches,
Long-tailed Grass Finches, Parson Finches, and Diamond Sparrows.
Of these the Zebra Finches and Ruficandas were really prolific, and lots
of young ones made their appearance during the course of the summer ;
but as autumn drew to a close their numbers decreased, and next spring
I had only one or two pairs of old birds left. Then, with their offspring
of the year, disappeared the following winter. It was clear that the
little birds could not be kept at liberty all the year round, cold and
natural enemies being too much for them.
This year, however, I determined to see if certain foreign Finches
cannot be profitably and successfully kept at liberty during the summer
months only. Ruficandas, unhappily, are almost unobtainable now-
a-days, but at the end of June I bought five pairs of freshly imported
Zebra Finches. Although they were by no means in good condition,
they began nesting the day after their arrival and quarrelled so badly
in the good-sized aviary in which they were released that three days
later I had to give them their liberty. This was really too soon, as it
did not give them time to get properly used to their surroundings.
Consequently three disappeared at once, and probably strayed, while

a fourth, the weakest of the lot, died of chill. The three remaining
pairs settled down nicely, and soon had nests, one pair choosing the
top of a pear-tree in the kitchen-garden, another a branch of a Douglas
fir about 40 feet from the ground, and the third built in a juniper fairly
low down. In due course two pairs brought their families to the feeding-
tray, one consisting of five young birds, and the other of three. When
the youngsters were quite independent of their parents I caught them up
for next year's stock. The cock of the third pair disappeared just about
the time that a brood should have flown. I bought a new mate for the
widow, but released him too soon and he did not stay. Some weeks
later the hen likewise disappeared. The two pairs soon set about
repairing their nests, and at the end of September two more broods
appeared--five and two, this time. As the season was getting on and
one of the old cocks was moulting and seemed a bit out of sorts, I caught
up the whole lot and ended the experiment for the year. On the whole
it has been a success, for though only seven old birds remain out of the
original eleven, I caught up nineteen Zebra Finches altogether. Had
I started in May with five strong pairs, and kept them in the aviary
ten days before releasing them I think there is little doubt that I should
have had well over thirty by now. The Zebra Finch is a jolly little
bird at liberty ; he is tame enough to let you see plenty of him and his
small size and nest-roosting habits protect him to a great extent against
the attacks of owls and other vermin ; he never goes far from home,
and will do well in quite a small garden ; Parrakeets need tall trees and
plenty of room, and are conspicuous targets for the guns of foolish or
ill-disposed persons, but tiny Finches are seldom noticed by those who
are not on the look-out for them. Zebra Finches build the same
substantial domed nests at liberty that they do in an aviary, and the
sexes seem to take turns in incubating the eggs, for when they are sitting
it is usual to see all the cocks feeding at one time and all the hens at
another. Both old birds accompany the young for a short time after
the latter have flown and the hen is the first to get tired of them; stop
feeding them and later drive them away.

By Frederick D. Welch
There were four specimens of this African species, Helotarsus
ecaudatus, living in the London Gardens in July, 1920, and as they showed
three distinct differences in coloration, although the birds were about
the same length, 23 inches, it seemed a good opportunity to point
out the differences at different ages and also to correct a misleading
statement in the Royal Natural History. Two of the Eagles which
arrived in June, 1919, had blackish-brown beaks, skin between that
part and the brown iris was brown ; in plumage they were darkish-
brown ; thd legs being tinged with pink, and they remained so till
August, 1921 (since when I have not visited the Gardens and any future
change is therefore unknown to me).
These two were, it seemed to me, undoubtedly much younger than
the other two, which arrived in 1906 and 1909, and were very different,
being bright red between brown iris and beak (latter black in tip half,
yellowish at base), with legs also red.
It is here that the statement in the Royal Natural History is mis-
leading, because in vol. ix, p. 212, it states that the facial colour of
some Bateleurs living then was " solely due to effects of captivity ",
as they were paler than the " coral red " referred to a few lines before ;
and the words seem to me to therefore imply that a captive bird cannot
be red on face. But such is an obviously erroneous idea, as proved by
the two Bateleurs referred to by me, and which were still in perfect
health as late as August, 1921, when last seen by me. As the section
is not signed by any special writer it is uncertain who held that view
(except that as Dr. Bowdler Sharpe is referred to by name it seems
certainly not he who wrote it) ; but it seems to me as probable that the
birds there referred to had not then reached their fully adult colour,
because I have seen several red-faced Bateleurs in captivity from about
1898 (three years after dating of that book) and onwards (in addition
to those two referred to). These were alike in plumage except the
wings, being chestnut maroon on back, rump, and short tail, and black
elsewhere. In the coloration of long wing feathers these two older
birds differed from each other considerably up to August, 1921, they

being black in whole exjflosed-to-view length in one bird, while they were
slate-grey with only the end inches black in the other bird (as in wood-
cut on p. 212, Royal Natural History), and this difference could be seen
when the Eagles raised their wings, and also when they sat with them
folded.
Personally I do not consider that the exact age of any Eagle captured
in fully adult plumage can be known ; and it also seems impossible
(in my humble opinion) to make any estimate as to the age of either
bird referred to which would get within a year or two of their ages.
The only thing presentable is to say they were " over 12 and 15 years "
when this account was penned, which is proved by their dates of arrival.
But one bird may have been several years older than the other when
caught--and from their wing-differences it would seem to me there is
considerably more than three years difference in age between them now.
But, be that view of mine as it may, the bird with black wing-feathers
seems to me older than the other, because it is more likely that grey would
darken into black as age advanced, rather than that a black feather
would turn grey in part. Upper parts of wing were brownish-black.
However, if either Editors or other member does not agree with this
view perhaps they will not hesitate to give their opinions in print.
As to habits, there are several voices uttered by Bateleurs which are
distinct; for instance, like the words " uck ! uck ! " etc., " warr !
warr ! " etc., " orr ! orr ! " etc. ; and on the ground they look rather
peculiar because of wings projecting beyond short tail when walking.
Though somewhat ancient history, it may be worth adding that several
years ago now, a single female deposited a white egg which was removed
by the then head-keeper as obviously unfertile, he showing it to me
(Birtling this was). Some reference to the habits when wild seems
worth mentioning in concluding these notes on captive birds, especially
its feeding on snakes, many of which it captures when grassy parts
are on fire, at times entering the thick smoke. When we compare the
short leg of a Bateleur with the long leg (about 2 feet, I should think,
estimating, on living bird) of the Secretary Vulture, it is clear that a
long leg is not necessary to repeatedly kill poisonous snakes by holding
them at a distance from the bird's body when disabling them by blows
on head from the powerful beak.

Personally I should think the success of the Bateleur is largely due
to rapidity of action in attack on the snake (in this being analogous
to Indian Mongoose, among mammals, versus Cobra) ; and this opinion
was supported some months after being formed by seeing two of the
living birds referred to engage in a pugnacious display when on the
floor of their cage, when both circled around each other rapidly by a
series of high hops. In addition to snakes and various reptiles, they
also feed on small mammals, carrion it is also said ; and can soar high
in the air (their wings being well developed, as shown when they stretch
them in the Gardens).

I saw on 10th August the young Black-capped Lory bred this
season by Mrs. M. Burgess, of Helston House, Clifton. It was apparently
about three months old, full-winged, and quite able to look after itself,
although I understand it retired at night with its parents to sleep in
the nest-box in which it was hatched. In size I should say it equalled
the hen. The iris was dark, the bill, which had been black, was at the
time of my visit rich horn brown, daily assuming an orange tint. It
seemed only to differ in colouring from the hen in having the under-tail
colouring greenish instead of violet blue. The colouring of its cap was
as dense as that of its parents. Although not densely feathered on the
breast, bunches of quills were fast appearing. It had already com-
menced to imitate sounds and whistles, and was an active and
engaging bird, susceptible of being perfectly tamed.
Two birds recently caught wild in the neighbourhood of Newport
(Mon.) were brought to me by two different people within a week.
The first, a male example of Spermophila torqueola. A handsome
masked cinnamon white and black bird, a very free singer. It was in
perfect plumage and quite tractable and had, I surmise, escaped from
a " Plate " boat coming into Newport, Cardiff, Bristol, Avonmouth,
or Barry Docks. This species I have never seen arrive in trade con-
signments, and have not seen it in any private collection, but believe
the London Zoo have had it once.

The other bird, harder to account for, was a Trumpeter Bullfinch,
a young male of the year, also in perfect plumage. This species has
not been conspicuous for many years. Mr. Meade-Waldo bred it and for
pleasing tone of colouring and that condition of plumage so favoured
by exhibitors of birds, it stands alone among comparatively plain
coloured finches. It is quite a time since I saw one alive. This may
have been a pet from a boat touching a South Mediterranean port,
but I have not heard that it is a common cage-bird among natives.
Among a consignment of South American birds lately received
in London I noticed specimens of Amblyrhamphus holosericeus, the
Red-headed Marsh Troupial, a bird which has been absent for years.
I secured a very tame Yellow Cassique ( C. persicus), which proved enter-
taining, and quite an attractive yellow and black bird with lemon-
green bill and china-blue irides. Its song is comical.
Another bird I secured, not often seen on the market, was a Green
or Yellow-bellied Maize-eater, or Greenish Hangnest. I found it active,
and not so devoid of interest as is the case with T. militaris and
L. superciliaris, two birds which, although conspicuous, are not attractive
in a cage. The olive-green of this Maize-eater contrasting with a band
of canary yellow makes it welcome in a collection of active birds of
this type.
These Troupials want grass and earth to " poke " their bills in,
otherwise in close confinement they require periodical trimming.
I also received two small Yellow-shouldered Troupials (A. thilius)
in apparently first plumage. These were much like miniature Meadow
Larks, minus the yellow chest. A few Diamond Finches came on the
market, and I was able to secure two pairs. Privately I received and
disposed of some Red and Green Parrot Finches and Pectoral Mannikins,
birds that are now increasingly scarce.
The Pesquets Parrakeet, now in the possession of Mrs. Burgess, is
quite a kind and affectionate bird, in spite of its rather forbidding
appearance. Clad for the most part in black and red, with its bare
face and throat coupled with an elongated vulture-like bill, it is not
unlike the Nestors. Had it a light iris it would possess a villanous
expression, but the iris is very dark. If maroon as described it must
be very dark maroon. I could not examine this item in full sunlight.

In the Bulletin of the Zoological Society of New York for September,
1921, Mr. Lee S. Crandall gives an interesting account of the display
of Parctdisorhis rudolfi, a pair of which species were acquired in the
autumn of 1920. The male commenced to moult almost simultaneously
with his arrival and when he had renewed his body feathers the pair
were placed in a cage near the other Birds of Paradise. All went well
for a few days, when suddenly the male attacked his mate, and only
her prompt removal saved her life.
" The comparatively short side-plumes of the male had now reached
their full length, and aj^peared as brilliant blue beneath and delicate
mauve above. The two central tail feathers or # wires ' had grown
to a length of a foot or more, each bearing on its tip a spatula of
brilliant blue.
" One morning a keeper who was working nearby noticed the male
bird was hanging upside-down from his perch, and otherwise con-
ducting himself strangely. He promptly reported that the bird was in
convulsions, and advocated its immediate removal to the hospital for
treatment. But more deliberate observation showed that while the
bird's antics might properly be described as a convulsion, it evidently
was not of the sort that calls for medical aid. He was in full display,
such as perhaps had never before been seen by civilized man. The
display of this species is entirely different to that of the Paradisea
group, for instead of remaining in an active, upright, position, he
grasps his perch firmly with his powerful feet, and with legs extended
to the utmost, hangs head downward. During the entire display of
several minutes the position of the feet is never changed, and the firm
grip never is relaxed
" Viewed from the front the plumes, inconspicuous and rather
disaqtpointing when at rest, form a brilliant inverted triangle, with the

raised feathers of the abdomen completing the centre. In the middle
appears a longitudinal, ovate patch of velvet black, bordered above
by a narrow band of dull red, formed by the feathers that ordinarily
clothe the abdomen. The long pendant # vires ' rise to half their
length, then droop gracefully downward on either side. The wings are
held tightly closed and the head is turned upward.
" During the display the body is moved forward and back with the
hips as a fulcrum, and with a violent motion of the body the plumage
is frequently spread to its widest expanse. The white lines of feathers
which border the eye above and below are conspicuously extended,
leaving the bird only a narrow slit through which to peer at the observer.
Throughout the bird sings softly, in a low, grating voice, moving his
head slightly by sharp jerks. This habit of singing, in which the Blue
Bird of Paradise often indulges, when not in full display, seems peculiar
to this species.
" Taken altogether the display of this bird is a beautiful and
marvellous sight. The rapid vibration of the body causes the brilliant
blues of his plumage to run in waves of colour over the entire filmy
triangle. The dead black spot in the centre is made more conspicuous
by the contrasting colour above it, and when seen under certain lights
appears more like a deep cavity than a mere patch of plumage."

A New Guinea Collection. --During the past few weeks some
interesting birds have been received at the Zoological Gardens.
Mr. Frost arrived home from his expedition to New Guinea at the end
of August, and in his collection were some fourteen birds of Paradise,
including the Greater, Lesser, Red, King, and Twelve-wired. We were
particularly glad to obtain a fine example of the last species. The
Aru Island Great Kingfisher (Seuromarptes tyro), of which there were
five specimens, is another very acceptable addition to the collection, as
it has apparently never before been imported alive. The Red-bellied
Rail (Eulabeornis castaneiventris), from the Aru Islands, is also new to
the collection, and so is Stephani's Green-winged Pigeon ( GJialcophaps
stephani) and the Orange-fronted Fruit Pigeon ( Ptilopus aurantiifrons).

There was also an example of the rare and curious Pesquet's Parrot
(Dasyptilus pesqueti), but this belonged to the collector, and was sent
to America.
Birds from Para.-- Another interesting collection received by the
Zoological Society came from Para and contained a Boatbill ( Can-
chroma cochlearia), two Cocoi Herons, two Maguari Storks ( Exenura
maguari), four grey-necked Tree-ducks ( Dendrocggna discolor), and two
Brazilian Motmots ( Momotus moniota). Of the latter, one was most
unfortunately (frowned in a severe thunderstorm.
Breeding Leadbeater Cockatoos. --An interesting event has been
the hatching and rearing of two young Leadbeater Cockatoos in one of
the aviaries on the south side of the Parrot-house. One of these tried
to take a flight abroad before he was strong enough to do so, and fell
to the floor and was injured, in consequence of which he is still unable
to fly, although his twin brother (or sister) can fly strongly. There is
no distinct juvenile qflumage in these Cockatoos, the young, on leaving
the nest, being the exact counterpart of their parents, although decidedly
smaller. This same species of Cockatoo bred in the Gardens several
years ago in the large aviary on the canal bank, which is now, alas !
given up to monkeys.
The Sombre Bulbul.-- Messrs. A. W. Garnage continue to receive
consignments from South Africa and amongst the latest arrivals were
some examples of the Sombre Bulbul (Andropadus importunus), a bird
that may be described as olive-green above and olive-grey below. Of
its habits and distribution the late Dr. Stark tells us that it is seldom
found away from the dense bush, and owing to its sombre colour and
shy habits is not easily seen or discovered ; it is sometimes heard seated
on the topmost branch of a tree giving forth a blythe song, and it has as

September : " A collection of kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, black
swans, native companions, Tasmanian devils, emus, many kinds of
parrots, and two splendid specimens of Papuan birds of paradise,
were boused on the deck of the White Star liner Medic, which left
for England to-day. The collection ivas accompanied by an expert.
It constitutes the first consignment by the Australian Zoological
Control Board to its depot in London before sale to or exchange with
other European zoological societies." The collection should reach
London about the first week in November, and it is probable that most
of the stock will be temporarily housed in the Zoological Gardens.
The Contents of the Collection. --Since the above was written
further information has come to hand of the contents of the collection,
and it would appear to be the finest single collection that has ever come
from the Antipodes, for, besides some hundred and fifty mammals,
such as kangaroos, wombats, and bandicoots, there are no less than some
twelve hundred birds from Australia and Papua. Amongst these may
be mentioned twenty-five Birds of Paradise, comprising the Magnificent,
Six-wired, and Count Raggi's, fourteen Eagles, seventy Fruit Pigeons,
two hundred and fifty Parrakeets, twenty-five Black Swans, ten
Laughing Kingfishers, eight hundred Finches, and many others. It
is unfortunate that this wonderful collection should be arriving at the
beginning of the winter, but at the same time birds purchased then will
have a chance of becoming established before the next breeding season.

One of the most interesting birds I ever knew was a Pel's Owl
(Scotopelia peli), a large species of African Fish Owl, about 23 inches
long, of rufous-bay in general colour, with transverse black bars, and
spotted on breast and abdomen with black. The iris in this individual
was dark brown ; and it frequently uttered a long-drawn-out voice
rather like " teroo-o-o-o-o ", and became very tame with me. The
range of species is from Senegambia to Gaboon and Zambesi area, there

being no ear-tufts. Can we exclude the possibility of the voice being
indirectly of use ? I see no reason, even though it feeds on fish, why
the voice, if suddenly uttered, should not startle a small mammal or bird,
and make it more easily seen by the Owl; and my experience in England
has been that some mammals certainly stay quiet if alarmed for a time
to escape danger, and will move if a sudden noise is made (for instance,
a wild vole I experimented on in 1917). Bouvier's Owl ( S. bouvieri) is
another species in the genus, the individual seen being from Lagos.
Briefly described it was smaller than S. peli and paler brown, the black
parts not so well marked ; iris dark brown. Unfortunately I do not
remember its voice. Does any reader 1
A Winking Owl ( Ninox connivens ) from North Queensland used to
utter a sound like " woop ! woop ! " ; it being a pretty little grey
bird with pale breast longitudinally streaked with brown and no ear-
tufts. But the most extraordinary sound I have yet heard from any
foreign Owl was a weird sepulchral cry which I believe came from a
Milky Eagle Owl ( Bubo lacteus), a large ear-tufted species about
27 inches long, ranging in Africa south of a line from Senegambia to
Abyssinia. Considering that it and also a second bird seen were in
general colour of a darkish grey, with paler breast and abdomen, and
a black semicircular mark on each cheek (concave towards the beak),
the species name seems to me very unsuitable, because the breast and
abdomen were the only parts having any approach to milk white. Was
the type specimen an albino individual ? However, it seems to me that
a species name ought to be retained even if it does not agree in colour,
because if people start to alter names originally given to the types*
they knock away, so to speak, the foundations of nomenclature ; and
the result would be to cause confusion among ornithologists and do
more harm than good.
In this Owl it seems to me that such an unearthly sound as that
voice would make a concealed mammal or bird start and expose its
whereabouts to a passing Owl. The sound referred to made me " jump "
at the moment.
Syrnium indranee of South India and Ceylon is an attractive looking
species, a living individual uttering voice much like S. aluco ; and to
show how variable it is I am quoting from writings of the late

Dr. Rowdier Sharpe (P.Z.S., 1887, p. 477), omitting unnecessary
words.
Male, from Ootacamund ; pale brown, chest barred like rest of
under-surface ; face uniform deep ochreous buff, with scarcely any
white posterior line between ear-coverts and ruff ; wing, 12&apos;8 in.
Female, same locality ; similar to male, but with a little fringe of
white behind the ear-coverts, which are uniform ochreous buff;
wing, 13 in.
Female, same locality ; very pale below, chest narrowly barred with
brown, like rest of underparts ; face deep ochreous, with scarcely
any indication of dusky cross-barring.
Female, from Nilghiris ; very pale below, with whitish cross-bars ;
face deep ochre, barred across with blackish ; wing, 13 - 9 in.
Female (?), South Indian ; very tawny, face deep ochreous buff-
rufous near eye ; scarcely any sign of white or frill of ear-coverts ;
wing, 13'6 in.
Female (?), Ceylon ; dark bird, chest barred like rest of under,
surface ; face deep ochreous buff, with evident traces of dusky cross-
bars ; wing, 13&apos;2 in.
Another Ceylon specimen, a darker bird, chest coarsely barred with
dark brown, somewhat uniform on sides ; face deep rufous ochre,
slight indication of white on lower part near frill ; wing, 12 - 5 in.
(probably male).
Another Ceylon bird, strongly tinged with ochreous below ; face
bright orange rufous, scarcely any white on lower margin ; no sign of
cross-barring on face ; wing, 11 9 in. (probably a male).
When we consider that Owls roam from place to place it seems to
me there is no doubt that S. indranee varies in the same locality in both
sexes. Two specimens of the Ural Owl ( Syrnium uralense) of north and
east Europe and Siberia, a large species about 25 in. long, varied in
general colour ; one a pale bird, with darker streaks on head, breast,
and abdomen ; the other being a blackish coloration with darker
marks showing through. Both uttered at times a bleat like a goat,
and were living in same cage. Is this species of dimorphic coloration
at times (analogous to what occurs in some mammals) a double-normal
coloration ? Or was the above an abnormal melanistic specimen ?

REMARKS AND QUERIES ABOUT IvAGU
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99767296" page_id="32670777"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --In the Avicultural Magazine of 1920 some remarks, mostly
about the voice of this bird, Rhinochaetus jubatus, were printed on p. 182,
they being founded on an individual which had lived in the London
Gardens since November, 1906. It seems worth adding now that
when in the Gardens in June, 1921, I was told that the bird had recently
died, which brings its life in captivity to 14.1 years. Can anyone give
a longer-known-life in a captive bird ?
When the note referred to was written by me I was not aware
that Mr. Heumann was breeding this aberrant offshoot of the Crane
group at his home in New South Wales, as mentioned by Mr. Seth-
Smith on p. 28 of the 1921 volume ; and as my note was, in addition
to recording voice, also intended to draw information from other people,
might I ask Mr. Heumann for some facts about his breeding pair ?
Is only one egg laid ? Is any nest made, or the egg laid on grass
only ? What is the colour and size of it ? Do both male and female
incubate ; and what is the period of incubation ? Is the newly
hatched bird downy, or is it naked ?
As Mr. Heumann has, so I was informed by a person who read my
note, already written about these birds, my queries may bring some
repetition of statements made in former volumes of the Avicultural
about his birds.
But even if so, it does not seem to me the repetition would be
superfluous, because new members are being added to the Society
(and many more will, I hope, join !), some of whom at least would also
be interested in the replies to above questions ; and also because it is

not always easy to get a copy of any special number where a bird or
group of birds a person is interested in have been written about.
I should also like to suggest that if Mr. Heuniann has a photograph
of a male, female, and chick which he has bred, they should be printed
in a future number of the Magazine to jDreserve a record, because it seems
to be not unlikely these birds may become extinct owing to their
defenceless nature and helplessness.
As to the adult in the London Gardens, I never saw it attempt to use
its wings in flight, which suggests the species had lost the knowledge
as to how they were formerly used ; nor did it even attempt to raise
them in like manner as the allied so-called Sun Bittern (Eurypyga
helias) of South America does, standing in self-defence when other birds
attempt to interfere with it, but the Kagu only crouched into a half-
standing position (as some domestic fowls do when alarmed) when
approached by strangers who tried to handle it, and made no attempt
to resist interference.
On this subject I cannot find any information in the books by me
now ; but judging from the attitude of the Kagu in the Gardens in
London, it seemed to me as probable that the species had lost the use
of wings owing to living century after century in an island home (New
Caledonia) in the Pacific Ocean ; and where, so far as I am aware,
there are none of the flesh-eating marsupials known as Dasyures and
their allies, which mammals are presumably frequently stalking birds
on the Australian mainland, and in doing so keeping their wings in
good order by making them use these parts, in addition to their legs,
to escape mammalian enemies. Is this opinion of mine about Kagus
having, as a species, lost the use of their wings supported by observa-
tion on other birds ?

Gould originally called it, namely Polytelis. If the Rock Pebbler and
the Barraband are Polytelis, then, undoubtedly, the Queen Alexandra
Parrakeet is also.
Just because the latter species sports in the male one spatulated
feather in the primaries, it was afterwards placed by itself under the
title of Spathopterus. Now it has been found that that name is pre-
occupied, and Mr. Matthews has coined a new one, and to my mind an
entirely unwarrantable one, namely Northipsitta alexandrce. All this
trampling upon original names and separation of species because of
one feather is ridiculous, and more, it is presumptuous.
I will not dwell upon the trinomal nomenclature, because in
aviculture I have something better to do than to talk of my Bullfinch
as Pyrrhula pyrrhula pileata ! But I can only say that when my living
Queen Alexandra Parrakeets die I shall refuse to present their skins
to any museum or individual (and they are extremely rare, even as such)
unless the bird is labelled what Gould named it, namely Polytelis
alexandrce, and that only.
No doubt one gains some kudos when coming generations see one's
name as the giver of titles along with Linnaeus, etc., but if we once let
in the thin end of the wedge and ignore ornithologists, such as Gould,
I see no reason why we should not all of us invent and coin a different
name for the same bird, according to our fancies, just as war-profiteers
and neuveaux riches put together some ridiculous coat of arms, or calmly
annex the crest of another family, as well as the name !

Sirs,- --I have bred three fine young Queen Alexandra Parrakeets
this year. A male Barraband ( Polytelis barrabandi) mated with a
female Polytelis alexandrce, but unfortunately the latter died when there
were two beautiful young birds in a nesting-box, and they also
succumbed. They favoured the male in colouring, and, of course,
had the rose colour on the underpart of the tail-feathers, which is
common to both species.

BREEDING THE YELLOW-BILLED CARDINAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992413214285714" page_id="32670780"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
Sirs. --I see from the August number of the Magazine that
Capt. Rattigan has bred the Yellow-billed Cardinal, and that he is
under the impression that this has not occurred before in this country.
I bred the species in 1911, in my old aviaries. Two broods of two and
three youngsters respectively left the nest during the summer; beyond
providing a large number of insects, I had no difficulty at all with
my birds.
Bird-keepers will remember that this species was quite common
and cheap in those days, and I was much more interested in the hoped-
for breeding of a pair of Black-cheeked Cardinals ( P. nigrigenis), which
unfortunately did not materialize.
Mr. Temple clearly remembers the rearing of the young Yellow-
bills, but we neither of us knew that the occurrence was an unusual one.

THE INCUBATION PERIOD OF CRANES
</sectionHeader>

Sirs,-- The hatching of a young white-naped Crane in the Zoological
Gardens last spring is not the first case of a Crane breeding in the Zoo.
The Mantchurian Crane bred there in 1861 ( Proceedings , 1861, p. 369).
The incubation period of the white-naped Crane which bred at
the Gardens last spring was said to be thirty-five days from the laying
of the first egg. Blaauw gives thirty days, as noted in the Amsterdam
Zoological Gardens. He also says that, when his own Mantchurian
Cranes bred, the first chick was hatched on the thirty-first day after
the laying of the first egg. It almost looks as if the incubation period
varied in these birds to the extent of several days.
I have a pair of Mantchurian Cranes which have nested the last three
years. I made very careful notes in 1919, in wdiich year the female laid
the first egg on 28th April, and began to sit at midday that day. The
first chick was hatched on 1st June, the thirty-fourth day after the
laying of the first egg. Last year only one egg was hatched. If it was
the second egg laid, it hatched on the thirty-fourth day, but if it was the
first laid it did not hatch until the thirty-seventh day, which seems
improbable.

BREEDING OF THE SALTATOR TANAGER

<bodyText confidence="0.99782744" page_id="32670785"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Last autumn Mr. Rogers, of Liverpool, sent me a line saying lie
had some South American stock in and would I care to have a look,
so I went round to see what had arrived. Amongst the arrivals were
some large brown birds like Grosbeaks, which I had not previously seen,
so I selected what I thought would be a true pair. I have since
discovered that they are Saltator Tanagers, apparently Saltator
aurantiirostris. One bird showed a yellow under mandible, and
the other, which was similar to several of the others, had two
dark mandibles. This proved to be a hen, but as she was about
the cleanest and strongest of the lot I was half afraid it might
turn out to be a young cock. I took them home, and in a few
days let them out in the large aviary. The hen at once gathered a few
sticks and straws together, and with a little hay made the beginning
of a nest, but it was never completed, and they soon took no notice of
it. In the early spring I drove all the birds into the bird house, and did
not let them out again until all the shrubs and trees had made a good
start and the aviary had been cleaned up generally. As soon as they
had the chance of getting out of doors again they began to build a
large strong nest in an elder. The nest was formed of strong twigs
as the foundation, smaller twigs, hay, rootlets, etc., being placed on
top, and the inside lined with hair, fibre, and fine hay. The outside of
the nest was rough and not unlike a large blackbird's, but well-finished
inside. The hen laid and commenced to sit, and I went to have a peep
Avhen she was off to see what the nest and eggs were like. T could
see into it and did not disturb it in any way, but she never went near it

again. There was only one egg in it, something like a thrush's egg.
They began to build another nest in a small shelter shed, which was
completed in a few days, but they appeared not to like it, and started
a fresh one outside in an elder. This, again, they left, and I presently
found they were sitting in the nest in the shelter shed. Four eggs were
laid, but only one young one was hatched, which left the nest when
not fully feathered, much as the smaller thrushes and blackbirds out
of a nest do here. This young one used to climb about in the bushes
and on the ground, and was well attended to. I saw it many times, and
it much resembled the hen, except that the colour was darker. I
imagined it was fully reared, but for some reason it disappeared--
possibly the old birds stopped feeding, or it did not find the water,
the weather was very dry and hot and the water was a good deal
hidden by long grass. Anyhow, the old birds had built another nest
and were sitting again, in an elder, outside. They had commenced to
feed their young before I went away for three weeks, and on my return
I found two strong young birds, fully as big as the parents, flying about.
In a few days I saw them eating buds and coming in the evening for
a drink and a feed of live food (gentles), wdiich is always kept in a tin.
This time they appeared to be two cocks, as they were almost exactly
like the cock, except that both mandibles are light yellow horn colour,
and there is no clearly defined bib marking. Both old and young are
not at all shy, and come quite close for live food. She sat closely but
used to come off for a feed in the evenings. The cock was very attentive,
and used to carry food to the hen, and always gave her food when she
came off the nest--mealworms or hop-buds, or anything he could get.
I never saw him sitting on the nest. Both birds worked hard at building
the nest. The young were fed on mealworms, gentles, milk-sop, and
buds from the hop-plants, and later on seeds as well. The first
day or two the parents used mealworms only, which they killed very
carefully before taking to the nest. I used to think the mealworm had
been eaten sometimes, but found they always flew away with it and out
it came again to uudergo a further preparation before flying off to the
nest. Almost from the first they fed the young on small hop-buds,
also a little milk-sop. They are quite quiet in the avairy except when
nesting and then, as might be expected, they rush at and drive away
any birds that come near the nest.

By M. Amsler, M.B.
Although the King is not a very rare species, and is found either
singly or in pairs in most large collections, I believe I am right in thinking
that the successful rearing of young is a somewhat unusual occurrence.
In the first place hens are not very easily come by, a good many
supposed hens being males in immature plumage. As the males take
three years to develop their distinctive plumage this, in itself, may cause
the hopeful aviculturist no inconsiderable delay. Furthermore, the hen
King Parrakeet appears very loth to make use of a nest-box. In the
wild state the species chooses the hollow limb of some tall and rotten
tree ; the entrance hole may thus be at a height of 30 or 40 feet and the
actual nest almost at the ground level. In captivity it is obviously
impossible to provide a nest-box more than 3 or 4 feet long, and
this may account for the birds' unwillingness to make use of the usual
type of nest-box with which they are provided. My pair of birds came
to me from Sir Leo Chiozza Money in 1920 with a rather bad character,
the hen had either laid and refused to sit, or had not used a box and
thus spoiled the eggs--I forget which.
These birds spent the winter and early spring in a fair-sized aviary,
together with a pair of Blue and Black Jays ; they paid little attention
to each other, but devoted all their spare time to destroying what few
bushes the aviary contained. In April I put the pair in a small all-wire
flight, 10 ft. by 4 ft., provided with two types of nest-box. One a deep
box about 3 feet long, with a hole near the top and a concave wooden
bottom ; the other was also about 3 feet in length, but was laid
horizontally and had one end open to allow the birds to enter--to my
mind the latter was an ideal box. These boxes I have lately removed,
and I do not believe either bird ever entered them, as the sawdust which
I placed inside was not even disturbed, and there was not a feather
or other sign of a bird having inhabited either nest.
Knowing their species' propensity for laying on the ground I also
provided a half coco-nut husk cemented into a box and buried flush
with the surface of the ground. In May the birds were seen pairing,
and the cock was constantly dancing round the hen and being generally

officious. On the 13th of that month I saw the hen very busy on the
ground, scraping a hole with her beak and feet, all the time assisted by
the cock, who fussed around freely and did nothing at all. I examined
their #C scrape " later in the day ; it was a very rough affair, about 9 inches
in diameter and some 3 inches deep, and contained a number of stones,
which I removed. Next day there were again a number of stones in
the ## scrape ", and this time I left them there--they were collected and
carried to the nest by the hen.
By 18th May all traces of the " scrape " had disappeared, and I found
an egg on the ground near where it had existed. I put this egg in the
coco-nut husk, which happened to be near by. On the 20th another
egg was laid in exactly the same place as the first. This was evidently
a spot to the hen's liking, so I made a hollow and firm hole in the ground,
surrounded it by four bricks placed on edge, and placed the two eggs
in the middle. On the 21st I was glad to see that a third egg had been
added in the artificial nest. On the 23rd the fourth egg was laid, and
on that day I covered the nest by a sort of tunnel made of galvanized
iron bent into a semicircle, and kept in position by wooden pegs
driven into the ground ; the hen could enter from either end.
Fortunately, all this in no way disturbed her, and she laid two more
eggs on the 25th and 27th, making a total number of six, of which I
had to remove one as it was cracked.
At first the hen sat very unsteadily, but I should say that she began
incubation with the fourth egg. The eggs varied a good deal in size
and shape, were very granular in texture, and two, at least, might be
described as nodular, quite unlike any other eggs I have ever seen ; this
may, of course, be an exceptional feature, due to some defect in the
female bird. After the first few days the hen incubated very well,
but owing to the shape of the earth bottom of the nest the eggs rolled
about a good deal, and I frequently saw one or more eggs which were
not properly covered when watching the hen on her nest. On several
occasions I deepened the hole and tried to make it more to the hen's
liking, but the earth was inclined to crumble away at the edges and to
fill up the hollow. Each time I looked in I found and removed a number
of pebbles, evidently put in either by the cock or by the hen on her
return to her nest; I much feared that these would break the eggs and so

dared not leave them. Could they have been put in to prevent the eggs
rolling about ? I allowed incubation to proceed until 20th June---
over three weeks, when I examined the eggs ; they were all infertile,
so I removed them and the nesting arrangements in the hopes that a
further clutch might be forthcoming and that the birds would choose
a nest-box. During all this time the cock was most assiduous in feeding
the hen, and became much tamer than he had formerly been.
On 30th June, 2nd July, and 3rd July three eggs were laid again
on the ground. This time I cut a hemispherical hole in a thick piece of
timber, which I buried flush with the ground and in which I placed the
three eggs. On 5th July a fourth egg was laid with the preceding ones,
and I then replaced my galvanized iron roof. The hen looked like laying
for another three days, but changed her mind and began incubation
on 8th July. She sat very steadily, with the cock in constant attendance,
until 28th July, when three chicks hatched out; incubation was there-
fore just under three weeks.
Fearing that the chicks would wriggle out of their shallow nest, I
made a sort of box, some 6 inches deep, which T fixed round the nest
on 6th August; the parents had to climb over the edge to get down
to the young, but they were in no wise disturbed by this change in
their home, and I have no doubt that I should have failed in rearing the
young had I not taken this precaution. The chicks were even uglier
than most parrakeets in the early stages, the skin being greyish white
covered with dark grey down. They were constantly brooded by the
hen during the first ten days, and I think the cock did most of the
feeding, though I am not certain whether at this period he gave the
food direct to the chicks or whether he fed the hen, who subsequently
fed the young. Very large quantities of hemp and sunflower seed
were consumed. Unlike Rosellas and Cockatiels, soaked bread and
ground rice were not touched. Owing to the drought there was a
great scarcity of groundsel, chickweed, and dandelion, but a large
seeding lettuce would disappear in an incredibly short time.
By 6th August, at the age of 9 days, the young were well covered
with quills, and extremely noisy when hungry. By the 20th the quills
were bursting, and the green colour was clearly visible on the heads and
backs. One of the chicks was considerably smaller than the other two.

166 M. Amsler -- Breeding of the King Parrakeet
Growth continued apace, and on 5th September, at the age of 6 weeks,
the first youngster left the nest and marched solemnly about the small
aviary. Pie was about two-thirds the size of the parents, with, of course,
a stumpy tail, which made him look still smaller. The colour was much
that of the female ; green head and back, with darker flights ; the rump
blue, legs and feet horn coloured, beak a pinkish brown. The young of
the species are said to have the outer webs of the tail feathers pink,
but I could not find this trait in my birds, even on handling them. The
first young bird returned to its somewhat unnatural nest for the night
but reappeared on the two following days ; it was, however, very timid,
and would always bolt back to its " burrow " on the approach of any
human being.
By 12th September this bird could fly strongly, and looked very
nearly as large as its parents. On this day, the second chick left the
nest and did not return -- there was heavy rain that night, but neither
looked any the worse on the morning of the 13th, when a third and
much smaller chick appeared. As the flight has no shelter and the
nights were becoming cold, I caught and transferred the five birds to
an aviary with a large shelter shed, into which I had them shut up at
night. For a time the smallest bird was inclined to mope about on the
ground, and spent much of his time crying bitterly for the companion-
ship of his brothers and parents on the perches above. I occasionally
took him up in my hands and put him on a branch ; this was always
accompanied by a violent fit of yelling, which continued long after I
had left him, and reminded one strongly of a frightened or spoilt child.
At the present time, 1st October, all three young can fly strongly.
Their favourite food is hemp, sunflower, and apple, but they also eat
a fair quantity of mixed chicken corn and boiled maize. The two larger
ones are scarcely distinguishable from their mother, but one of them has
distinctly brighter and more extensive red on the underparts, and is
obviously a male. They are quite independant, but they still like being-
fed, and on this point their parents pander to them.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O.
A recent advertisement, of Drongos and some South. African Shrikes
drew me to the " Zoo " at Damages, my first visit to this delightful
place, hut I hope not the last.
These particular birds were my main attraction, for I have kept
(or rather tried to keep) a few of them in West Africa, but the whole
place and all its occupants were a revelation to me. More or less cut
off from things birdy in recent years, I had no idea that such advances
in the bird-dealing line had been made nor that a " bird-shop ", even
at its highest (as here), could be such a delightful place, where birds
looked well, were kept well, and apparantly sold well.
The sight of these Shrikes determined me to try again with some
of the Gambian species if opportunity offers, and also led me to look
up what records I have at hand of the keeping of Shrikes in captivity.
These are chiefly back numbers of the Avicultuml Magazine and Bird
Notes, some of the more recent Zoo lists, and an occasional reference
elsewhere. The following is the result of my search, and although there
must be a few more records of other species obtained by our own or
other Zoos or by dealers, I think it must contain nearly all the Shrikes,
which so far have attained avicultural interest.
As regards the Drongos, which, however, are, of course, not true
Shrikes, I have occasionally seen an odd example of an Indian species
in captivity, but never before an African. Have any African Drongos
been ever imported before these birds at Gamages % They are, I presume,
either Dicrurus afer or ludwigi, but as their tails are broken one cannot
be sure whether they are the first, the Fork-tailed, or the second, the
Square-tailed Drongo.
Mr. Finn, in his article on the " Cage-birds of Calcutta " ( Ibis 1901),
mentions three species of Indian Drongo, but of these he says that only
one, the Bhimraj, Dissemums paradiseus, is at all commonly seen in
captivity. The only other record I find is another Asiatic species, the
Javan Drongo, Grgpsirhina varians, one of which appears in the
Zoo lists as " new to the collection " in 1907. I will now get on to the
true Shrikes, Laniidce.

Dr. Hopkinson --Shrikes as Cage-birds
The Great Grey Shrike, Lanius excubitor.
Was (and no doubt will be again) a not uncommon and a
very attractive show bird. As many as four at one show r are recorded
in the A.M. for 1908 (p. 158, Crystal Palace Show of that year).
Bechstein includes it in his book on cage-birds, giving some ten lines
to its " attractive qualities ", and mentioning its use as a " Sentinel "
in Falcon-catching. It also finds a place in some of the English cage-
bird books, such as Birchley, etc.
The Lesser Grey Shrike, Lanius minor.
I believe I have seen this bird on the show bench, but can find no
record. Bechstein gives quite a long account, and calls it a " very
desirable cage-bird ". Altogether this writer deals with four Shrikes,
the other two being the Woodchat and Bed-backed.
The Red-backed Shrike, Lanius collurio,
Besides being not uncommon as a show-bird, has the distinction
of being the only Shrike hitherto bred in captivity. A pair belonging to
Dr. Giinther nested in 1904, and between then and 1912 reared
altogether seven broods in captivity. See A.M 1904, 339 ; 1912, 335,
and elsewhere in the interim.
The Woodchat-Shrike, Lanius senator.
This rare visitor to Britain has made a very occasional appearance
at shows, but except for one once brought me alive in the Gambia,
where it is a common winter visitor, I have never seen one in captivity,
Other members of the genus Lanius which my records lead me to
include are :--

in the Zoo lists as new birds in 1902, 1912, and 1915 respectively. 1
Captain Perreau in Bird Notes for 1911 (p. 254) described Nos. 3 and 4
as making " very good pets when hand-reared. Wild-caught birds
I have not tried, but fancy they would be difficult to steady down ;
they have quite pleasing notes, and some very harsh ones".
No. 1, the American Grey Shrike, appears in Russ' big work,
the only true Shrike included. The only fact of real avicultural interest
mentioned is that three were kept in 1879 in Chicago (Fremdlandishe
Studenvogel, ii, p. 464). The Indian Grey Shrike holds much the
same position in Dr. Butler's book, where we learn that the first example
our Zoo had was obtained in 1890. He also mentions certain North
African Shrikes reared by Mr. Meade-Waldo. (See Foreign Cage-birds,
ii, p. 57, and A.M., 1905, p. 45.)
No. 7, the latest record is the large black and tvhite long-tailed
Magpie-Shrike, of South Africa. One of these reached the Zoo in 1920.
We can now turn to the Bush-Shrikes, the Malaconotince, examples
of which were the original cause of this article. These are, indeed,
rare cage-birds, even compared with their relatives already mentioned,
and records and references to them as such are few. In the A.M. for
1902, Dr. Butler (p. 44) writes of some of the South African Bush-
Shrikes as likely to make desirable cage-birds, and in his Birds of
Africa (vol. v, p. 410), Captain Shelley quotes Swynnerton as having
kept specimens of the Southern Grey-headed Bush-Shrikes,
Malaconotus hypopyrrhiis, in captivity for some time and found that
they fed freely on locusts, grasshoppers, and the like. This is just
what I found with those I have tried to keep in Gambia, but they never
got really meated off.
The Four-coloured Bush-Shrike, Laniarius quadricolor, was
in the Zoo collection in 1882 according to Dr. Russ (T.c. 464), and this
is the only record I have come across which can be said to raise these
birds from the ranks of potential to actual cage-birds, and the two
species on show at Damages are the first I have known as such, except
for my own unsuccessful efforts in this direction in West Africa.
The species represented are the Senegal (or Black-headed Bush-
i The Shrikes now at Carnages were all wild-caught, but in spite of this are
quite steady, one or two of them wonderfully so.

Dr. Hopkinson -- Shrikes as Cage-birds
Shrike, Tschagra senegala, and the Pufeback-Shrike, Dryoscopus
cubla, I presume.
Of the first, I think there are four examples all in good condition,
while one is in almost perfect fettle, a wonderful tribute to their
importer's care, as, indeed, are all the birds he brought with them,
both hard- and soft-billed. For general good condition and looks the
Robin-Chats and some rare Bulbuls would take a lot of beating, while
a cageful of Dufresne's Waxbills absolutely took my breath away for
good looks, although apparently still in the cage in which they travelled.
I have brought home a good many Waxbills in my time, and am quite
satisfied usually with the condition in which they arrive, but I have,
I am sure, never bettered this lot.
The Senegal Shrikes are particularly interesting to me, for I know
them well in Gambia, where they are very common, and known as the
" Ndoio Above the colour is a rich red brown, below pale buff. The
crown is black, the eyebrow pale fawn, and there is a black streak below
the eye, giving the head a striped appearance. The tail is black with
white spots near the ends of the feathers, which are most conspicuous
when the bird flies. With us they are birds of the more open country,
where they spend much of their time on the ground among low scrub, in
which they skulk and manage in a wonderful way to hide their rather
conspicuous plumage. Vfhen obliged to fly they still keep low down or
perhaps more often take long flying hops along the ground to another
patch of shelter. They are always found in pairs, and when one leaves
a bush it is almost immediately followed by its mate. It is a beautiful
singer (probably the best we have in Gambia), and is heard mostly during
and just after the rains, and then most frequently and at its best in the
early mornings and late evenings. The song consists of a long strain of
sweet flutey notes, very distinctive when heard, but difficult to remember
or whistle. The Mandingos say that this bird is so proud of and so
wrapped up in the beauty of its voice that it shuts its eyes when singing
in order to listen better to its own notes, and then becomes so absorbed
in the performance that it can be easily caught in the hand. Needless
to say, I have never done or seen this done, but really I rather hesitate
to disbelieve it, for besides realizing now that there are many things in
Africa one cannot merely dismiss with scoffing, I saw one of the

Babblers I brought home caught in the hand on a fence in broad day-
light while engaged in scolding at another bird below him.
I had forgotten that these birds had so extensive a range in Africa
and that the West and South African birds are both senegalus till I
looked it up. I think, however, that the Gambian birds are rather more
ruddy than these I saw the other day, and I see (from Shelley) that the
two are subspecifically separated, Tschagra senegalus (Linn), Senegal
to Liberia, T. s. erythroptera (Shaw), South Africa.
Of the Puffback-Shrikes, if I remember rightly, there were two.
They had broken their tails and generally roughened themselves, but
were fat and healthy. Although now very steady, they obviously did
not at first take so kindly to cage-life as the others must have done.
Black and white, and the long soft white back feathers are the
main features of their coloration. In the Gambia our Puff back is
D. gambensis. I have never attempted to keep them and consider that
their successful importation is (together with that of the Drongos)
an even greater achievement than that of senegalus. Both Puffbacks
and Drongos have always seemed to me too flycatchery and difficult
to attempt.
Of the Bush-Shrikes the species which I should rather keep than
any, on account of his striking plumage, is : --
The Barbary Bush-Shrike, Laniarius barbarus.
This bird is glossy black above, below (from chin to vent) bright
scarlet, and its crown and forehead are yellow, a bird therefore to
catch the eye. They are quite common in the Gambia all the year
round, and frequent in pairs the outskirts of thick bush, particularly
along the swamps and near bush-wells or pools. Their call-note is
" tchirk-tchirk ", while besides they have a short whistling song of a
few notes.
I have kept several, but never for any length of time. All fed well,
probably too well, on large insects, lizards, small birds, mice, etc., but
I never got one on to a diet suitable for a homeward voyage. I must
say I never tried very hard, for I do not think I ever had one near the
time for my leave, so that I was never tempted to try and keep them
when there was any difficulty in getting live food.

A Fine Collection from South Africa
The Grey-headed Bush-Shrike, Malaconotus poliocephalus, is
another handsome bird, green above and yellow below, and distinctly
larger than the Barbary. They are more tree-birds than the other
Gambian species, and have a long-drawn sweet but rather monotonous
whistle.
I mention these two birds as desiderata, but really, if included at
all, their mention should have been higher up with the other " possibles",
for so far they are certainly nothing more.
I find two other entries of " Shrikes ". The first, A.M., 1903, is an

In conclusion I must just refer to other families of more or less
Shrike-like birds, which are known as cage-birds.
The Swallow-Shrikes, Artamidce. Two or more species used at times
to be imported.
The Crow-Shrikes, Gymnorhince. The best known of these are the
" Piping Crows ".
The Cuckoo-Shrikes, Campephagidcs , of two genera of which I know
single examples have reached England and perhaps there have been
more. These are Graucalus, as mentioned above, and Pericrocotus, the
Minivets. These are rare cage-birds in the East, but Mr. Ezra has kept
one at least in this country.
A FINE COLLECTION FROM SOUTH AFRICA
Perhaps the largest of all the'collections of birds that have arrived
from South Africa was recently received by Mr. Hamlyn, of St. George
Street, E. His collector, Mr. Grei, brought them home himself, and is to
be heartily congratulated upon the excellent condition in which the

Under the title Birds One Should Know, Messrs Gay &amp; Hancock
have produced a very attractive quarto volume, the letterpress of which
is by the Rev. Canon Theodore Wood, who describes thirty-three of the
commoner species of British birds, and deals especially with their
beneficial as well as their mischievous qualities. He is fair in his
criticism, and although in dealing with the Sparrow, for instance, he
lays full stress upon the good it performs in devouring insects in the
spring, he does not minimize the harm it does, and comes to the con-
clusion that this more than balances the good. He considers the
Chaffinch a friend to the farmer during one half of the year and an

good than harm.
The great charm of the book, however, lies in its illustrations, which
are all by Mr. Roland Green, a young artist who has done some very good
natural history work, and will, we think, soon be well to the fore in this.
There are no less that eight coloured and sixteen uncoloured plates,
and 185 text-figures. The illustrations are, in fact, the making of the

plate of Goldfinches on a thistle plant, is very charming, as is that of the
Lapwing with her young, the Great Tit ivith her brood of seven, or the
Pheasant in covert, while that of a collection of fifteen heads of birds
in colours is decidedly useful to the young student. The uncoloured
plates, some in half-tone and others in line-work, are also of high quality,
as are the text-figures, which are very generously distributed throughout
every page of the letterpress.

The title is perhaps somewhat misleading, for the youngest student
of British birds will want to know more of our birds than are described
here, and it seems strange that a book entitled Birds One Should Know
should contain no account of the Nightingale, Yellow-hammer, or
Linnet, while a comparatively rare species, such as the Short-eared
Owl should be dealt with. But we realize that the letterpress is
secondary to the illustrations.

A RARE BRAZILIAN OWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983104090909091" page_id="32670799"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --I have recently bought a very handsome small Owl, of which
1 do not know the name, and I should be greatly obliged if any member
could enlighten me. The dealer says that it comes from Brazil. It
is about the size of our Barn Owl, diurnal, streaked all over with brown
and tawny yellow, legs and feet covered with very close tawny down,
claws black ; feet and legs particularly neat, almost hawk-like. The
wings are very long, and project beyond thelongish barred tail ; under-
neath the wings the plumage is tawny. The facial disc is full and round,
but the head is rather small in comparison with most Owls ; iris bright
golden yellow, pupil black. Two very short " ears " quite close together
on the crown of the head, like a double crest. I think the bird can
elevate and depress these tufts, but am not quite certain ; they certainly
appear more erect if the bird is alarmed or excited, but it may be that
they seem so because the other head feathers are depressed.
When this Owl sits erect on its stump it is strikingly hawk-like.
It is in good plumage, and keeps itself very clean, enjoying a bath nearly
every day.
I should like to know if it will stand the winter in an out-door
aviary facing south, Avith wooden sides and roof ; also if it has been
frequently imported.
Ethel F. Ci-iawner.

I will try and answer some of Mr. F. D. Welch's queries by beginning
at the end! The spotted breast and flanks in Strix clelicatula is sexual.
In the Brown Owls the males when adult have almost invariably
white breasts without spots ; when young they occasionally have a
few spots on the flanks, but these are lost with years. The reverse is
the case with the females, the spots on flanks, etc., get thicker and
more extended with age.
The very dark Ural Owl which was in an aviary with an adult of the
normal colour was a melanistic--two of these melanistic forms arrived
--and I believe it is not very rare in one locality. The Ural Owl is a
true Wood Owl, with all the habits of our Tawny Owl. An adult female
that I had in confinement for some years escaped and immediately
resumed her natural wild life in our woods. She was evidently a wild-
caught bird, and evidently also the mother of a young one that I
obtained with her. She hunted like the Tawny Owl, floating from tree
to tree silently, and intently listening for the slightest movement in
leaves or grass. She evidently knew all about squirrels, for when she
had only been out a week I saw her visit several squirrels' dreys and pull
them about to see if the owner was at home. She was seen occasionally
for about twelve months, and was eventually shot about 40 miles
away two years after her escape.

The Marquess of Tavistock --
The Ceylon Wood Owl (Syrnium indranee ) differs much in both sexes
throughout its range, as does our own Tawny Owl. In this country
it appears to be of three types, foxy red, brown, and ash grey, of which the
latter is the rarest locally. Every intermediate form of colouring occurs,
and it is extremely hard to find two alike. I think as a rule the foxy-red
individuals are inclined to be most numerous in the west, and the grey
in the east, but you may find both extremes in the same nest, or, rather,
. in the same brood when they have got their complete plumage in August.
The Owls are so admirably equipped with their marvellous powers of
hearing and sight that there seems no reason to suppose that their voice
is used for any other purpose than that of communicating with one another
and a love song as in other birds.

There are certain birds which, while they do not succeed at liberty
on the first or second trial, nevertheless do not behave so badly that one
puts them down as hopeless. I have made three or four experiments
with Passerine Parrotlets, better known by their trade name of Blue-
winged Lovebirds. They are attractive little fellows, and the Kingfisher
will not give you a lovelier flash of colour than the cock as he flies across
the garden with his mate under the summer sun. But somehow I
could not get them to breed, and while they proved hardy enough when
over the effects of their journey and not such inveterate migrants and
wanderers as Budgerigars and Black-cheeked Lovebirds, their numbers
gradually dwindled until none at all remained. One pair lived through
a severe winter out of doors, in spite of the fact that the hen had a
damaged wing and could not fly properly ; but when summer returned
and I made sure they would nest, they, too, disappeared. During the
course of my early experiments I learned a few things about Bluewings
in captivity. (1) That it is fatal to keep them in a cage with varnished
woodwork ; they nibble the wood, and then it is good-bye. (2) That
they are fond of moistened stale bread or sponge-cake ; I could never

common sight to see them feeding on the turf when at liberty. (3) That
you cannot keep pairs together in a confined space for more than a
limited period. Sooner or later they start fighting most murderously ;
separating the sexes improves matters a bit, but the safest plan is to
keep each pair by themselves. (4) That, while they do not need a
large aviary, they pine away if kept in a cage for many months with-
out the amusement of a nest-box. I wish people would realize that it
is absolute cruelty to keep Lovebirds, Parrotlets, or even Budgerigars
&apos;permanently in a small cage with no opportunity of breeding.
In the early summer of 1920 I obtained a few pairs of freshly imported
Bluewings and turned them out in my garden in Hampshire, but the
torrential rain of that misguided summer, which seems to have borrowed
the entire rainfall of 1921 to add to its natural allowance, proved quite
too much for the Parrotlets, who all disappeared or contracted chills,
and only one hen survived. I determined to try a final experiment
with more or less established birds, and during the winter made up four
healthy pairs, which I released in the middle of May, adding a fifth
hen some time later as a mate for a Red-faced Lovebird. The Blue-
wings soon settled down and started inspecting nest-boxes and
quarrelling among themselves. By the end of the month one pair
seemed on the point of laying ; then a run of bad luck began. A cock
and two hens disappeared, a third hen died egg-bound, and the remains
of a fourth were discovered which had probably fallen a victim to the
same complaint. During July a young bird made its appearance at the
feeding-tray, and when it was quite independent of its parents I caught
it up for next year's stock. Fearing that it might be lonely and refuse
food, I gave directions that it was to be provided with a young
Budgerigar as a companion, but my fears proved to have been only too
well justified, for I heard a few days later that the poor thing had
crouched in the corner of the cage and starved to death ! Moral :
Do not cage young Bluewings singly and without companions used to
cage life.
Things were looking bad for the success of my Bluewing experiment,
as my stock was now reduced to a single pair and the two widowed
cocks. In August the hen of the pair disappeared, and as her mate

did not seem to have much use for the society of the widowers. I hoped
that she might be sitting. The cock Bluewing, by the way, feeds his
sitting mate, like a Rosella, and does not sit on the eggs, though I think
he enters the nest at night. In September I obtained two new hens
and released them for a few weeks to get used to the place and keep the
unpaired males from straying. The rougher of the two I caught up
with her husband early the following month. At the beginning of
October the first hen reappeared and looked as though she had come
from a nest, as she was less spick and span than when I had last seen
her. From then onward she appeared with increasing frequency at the
feeding-tray. About the 10th of the month I began to hear squeaking
in the trees, which sounded fainter than and different in key from the
calls of the old birds. About the 15th I saw what I felt almost sure was
a young bird at the feeding-tray, and on the 19th I was agreeably
surprised to see nine Bluewings feeding at one time--the two old pairs
and five young ones. On the morning of the 22nd I saw seven feeding
together -- the family as I thought -- and, fearing a sudden break in the
mild weather, I caught the lot. As I was taking them indoors a single
adult cock flew over my head, and I concluded that his mate was
starting a belated nest which it would not be wise to allow her to con-
tinue with. The seven were placed in a large cage, and left in a quiet
room to settle down, which they soon did. The cock at liberty I
captured about 11 o'clock and placed, for the time being, in a cage
out of doors. I expected his mate to leave her nest before evening
when he no longer came to feed her. About 2 o'clock, sure enough,
I heard a Bluewing calling in the trees, but the voice sounded more
like that of a young than an old bird. A little later I put the cock's cage
outside in the hope of his acting as a decoy. In a few minutes, sure
enough, down came the owner of the voice--not an adult hen, as I
supposed, but a very hungry little cock, who unavailinglv besought the
prisoner to feed him. Then I saw what had happened ; we had caught
the second hen before breakfast, and had her already in the house,
leaving the fifth youngster at liberty. He had had nothing to eat all
day, being scarcely able to feed himself and being ignorant of the exact
whereabouts of the feeding-tray. I moved the cage into an aviary
flight, and the young Bluewing soon followed, but when I went to shut

the door he popped out again by the way he had entered. I next tried
putting the wire trap feeding-tray on the top of the cage, and before
very long he was safely secured and reunited to his family. I noticed
two things in connexion with the brood ; one was that the young cocks
were already distinguishable by their blue secondaries, although their
rumps were still green, 1 and their body plumage was more like that of
the female. The other point was that the old hen fed them quite
as much as the cock, although they had been on the wing some time.
A hen Lovebird hardly feeds her offspring at all once they have flown,
speedily tiring of them, and leaving them to the care of their more
patient and affectionate father.

AUSTRALIAN AND NEW GUINEA BIRDS:
A FINE COLLECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970426142857143" page_id="32670809"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
The collection of Australian and New Guinea mammals and birds
sent over by the Australian Zoological Control Board reached London
on 14th November in charge of Mr. A. S. Le Souef, the Director of the
Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney. It was a wonderful collection so
far as the mammals were concerned, containing a fine lot of Kangaroos
of several species, Wombats, Bandicoots, and Phalangers.
There were also some very nice birds consisting of two species of
Birds of Paradise, the Six-plumed (Parotia lawesi ) and the Magnificent
(Diphyllodes Jiunsteini), both species hailing from South-East New
Guinea.
Of Pigeons and Doves there were several species, the most interesting
being the White-fronted Bronzewing (Henicophaps albifrons) of New
Guinea, a species never before imported alive, so far as I am aware.
It is of a slaty grey colour with bronze reflections on the wings, a white
forehead, and an extremely long bill for a pigeon. Another very
interesting as well as a very beautiful bird is the Magnificent Fruit
Pigeon (Megaloprepia magnifica), of which there were some half-dozen
examples. It is leaf-green above with a grey head and purple breast.
The typical race occurs in Queensland and New South Wales. These
1 Since writing this paragraph I noticed that at any rate one of the nestling
cocks had quite a lot of blue on the rump.

examples are said to have come from New Guinea, and, therefore,
probably belong to the smaller race, which has been separated under the
name of M. assimilis. Three other species of Fruit Pigeons were tbe
Nutmeg ( Myrestivora ), Orange-bellied ( Ptilopus iozonus), and the Lilac-
crowned (P- coronulatus). I was greatly pleased to see a cage full of
the very beautiful Plumed Pigeons (Lophophaps leucogaster) and Naked-
eyed Partridge Pigeons ( Geophaps smithi ) from Northern Australia.
The former is a most delightful bird that one had not seen for many
years past. It was imported in 1905, and formed the subject of a very
charming coloured plate in the Avicultural Magazine for December,
1906. There were also a number of Australian Green-winged, Peacefid
and Bar-shouldered Doves.
Of Parrots there were Rosellas and Mealy Rosellas, Kings, Crimson-
wings, Redwings, and Cockatiels, the last two in numbers, two pairs of
Brown's, and several examples of the very beautiful and rare Swift
Parrakeet (Nanodes discolor). It is several years since I have seen an
example of this lovely species, though I believe a few have been
privately imported. It is vivid green in colour, with blue on the fore-
head and wings and scarlet on the face and shoulders and underneath
the wings. In its mode of feeding it closely resembles the Lorikeets,
sucking the sweet juices from the flowing eucalyptus trees and some-
times appearing in large numbers when these trees come into flower
in South-Eastern Australia and Tasmania. There were also a few of
the Yellow-vented Parrakeets of Tasmania ( Platycercus flaviventris),
a species very rarely imported.
The only small birds in the collection consisted of two cages full of
Chestnut-breasted Finches and some Diamond Sparrows, but there
were several other birds more suitable for a Zoological Garden than
for the private aviculturist, such as Emus, Black Swans, Blue Water-
hens, Pheasant Coucals, White-bellied and Wedge-tailed Eagles, and
one fine example of that strange bird, the Tawny Frogmouth ( Podargus)\0x25A0
All the stock arrived in extremely good condition, testifying to the
great amount of care taken over them during the eight weeks' journey
from Sydney.

<bodyText confidence="0.936897941176471" page_id="32670811"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- I have lately been fortunate in obtaining two Kagus,
which are probably male and female, and also probably bred by
Mr. Heumann in New South Wales. They are in immature plumage,
a dull grey, the wing coverts being barred with rusty-brown. The bird
that I take to be the male is of a purer grey than the other, and is more
masculine in appearance.
I believe that the eggs of the Kagu have a strong resemblance to those
of the Rail family, and are reddish buff with brown and grey markings.
Is the French Government taking any steps to strictly protect this most
interesting bird in its native haunts in New Caledonia % The Australian
Government might have some turned down in a sanctuary in Australia.
Is such a wonderful bird to be exterminated \ It is a long-lived
species, and the only representative of its genus, and breeds in captivity.
Let aviculturists and ornithologists bestir themselves to keep the Kagu
from everlasting destruction, before it is too late.

Sirs,-- In reply to Dr. Hopkinson's inquiry as to these birds, I fancy
that a few of them have come over lately, but several varieties of
Weavers are offered by the dealers from time to time as Cape Bishops.
About eighteen months ago Gamages had a cage of large Weavers
that they described as Cape Bishops. I bought four of them, two in
colour and two in eclipse. These birds were heavily and stockily built,
and were about the size of the Rufus-necked Weaver. Colour a rich
black, with the back and wing-coverts rich yellow, and this colour,

if I remember rightly, extended to the rump. From the shortness of
their tails I concluded that they were Weavers, and not Whydahs,
but they may have been P. macruma, although in Butler's book the
illustration of this Whydah shows the yellow on the upper part of the
back only, and the tail is shown longer than in my birds. One of these
birds came into partial colour after I had had it a few months, getting
the yellow areas as in the adult, but retaining the brown eclipse plumage
in the rest of the body. It remained like this until it was killed by a rat
about a twelve-month later. These birds built several nests in rushes
about a foot above the water, but as I was unable to get hens I was not
able to breed them.
This summer I visited Hamlyn's soon after he had received a
consignment of South African birds, and amongst several other Weavers
that are unknown to me I bought one showing yellow on the back.
This bird is about the size of a Napoleon Weaver, and has now come into
full colour, being an exact reproduction of the others on a small scale.
Can this be P. co/pensis ? Butler gives the size of the Cape Bishop as
6 t 7 q- in., and that of the Napoleon Weaver as 4- |in. My bird is certainly
no bigger than the Napoleon, so there is a considerable discrepancy in
the size. I am awaiting with interest to see what the others may be
&apos;when they come into colour.

instead of a female Quail, that is, rejecting a natural wife (as it may be so
termed) and taking to a more-distantly related one !
When in early life I lived at Shirley, near Southampton, I had a
Canary and later on bought two Budgerigars ; and as one of the latter
died and the survivor seemed to be affectionately inclined to the Canary,
I turned them into the same cage, where they lived amicably, They used
to have some amusing squabbles about bathing, because the Canary
(having been with us for some years before the Budgerigar arrived)
seemed to consider it had a right to bathe first; whereas the Budgerigar
often thought to enter the bath at the same time, which occasionally
led to a squabble in the water, and the ejection of one or other bather.
They always roosted side by side. These birds lived at the time of the
European Tree Frogs, mentioned by me in the Field, 1919, p. 752, and
their cage was usually in the same room as the vivarium where the Frogs
were. The Canary never seemed to bother its head about these lively
jumpers. But the Budgerigar used at times to be apparently perplexed
in mind when one or other of the Tree Frogs gave a sudden or extra
vigorous jump at a fly, and landed stuck on the glass. It never seemed to
understand these peculiar creatures ! Personally it seemed to me to be
more frightened for the moment than angry, and I don't think it would
have ventured too near to the Tree Frogs if all had been turned out
together ! But as the Tree Frogs were special pets of mine, I never ran
any risks of injury by letting the birds approach them.
When on a tour in Yorkshire during the summer of 1904 I was
surprised to see a Crowned Crane (Balearica regulorum) of Africa, wandering
about a farmyard among domestic fowls and ducks--all adults, so far as
I now remember--and the owner told me it agreed well with them, and
had been living there since brought home after the Boer War. Being at
that time engaged mostly with foreign mammals in my spare time, it
did not occur to me to ask whether the Crane was reliable in conduct
with chicks of the fowls or with ducklings. Perhaps some one else can
state more about that subject. So far as I now can remember, the place
was called Pickering.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 19 22
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97607152" page_id="32670822"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In reviewing the past year the Council desires to explain to Members
of the Society that the production of the Magazine has been seriously
hampered in two ways :--first, the high cost of printing, which has
made it necessary not only to forego the luxury of plates but also to
keep each part to a maximum of sixteen pages : and second, the
difficulty of securing the necessary contributions which has been the
prime cause of the unavoidable delay resulting in each issue being
nearly a month behind its time. There are, however, favourable signs
of an increase in membership and of a fall in the cost of production ;
and with the starting of a new series in 1923, with the special illus-
trated articles on Aviculture, made possible by the generosity of
subscribers, the Council looks forward to the future with complete
confidence in the success of the Magazine.
They wish to tender their grateful thanks to all who have contributed
to the upkeep of the Society during 1922, to the authors who readily
responded, often at a moment's notice, to the appeal for " copy ", to the
subscribers to the Illustration and General Funds, to the Editors,
Secretary, and Treasurer, and to Mr. T. H. Newman who kindly prepared
the index to the present volume.
Finally, they wish to record their sense of the great loss the Society
sustained in the untimely death of their colleague, Mr. Bonhote, who
as a member of Council, as Editor, Treasurer, and Secretary, was for
many years an energetic and enthusiastic worker in the interests of
Aviculture.
Signed for the Council.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must not have been previously published else-
where. It should describe the plumage of the young and be of value as a permanent
record of the nesting and general habits of the species. These points will have great
weight when the question of awarding the Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
*
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2|- inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [ name of

THE PROPOSED NEW BILL FOR THE
PROTECTION OF WILD BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995918409090909" page_id="32670847"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
Bv R. I. Pooock, F.R.S.
Many members of the Avicultural Society will remember that in
November, 1913, in response to a widespread and well-founded feeling
regarding the inefficiency of the existing law for the protection of birds,
Mr. McKenna appointed a special committee to take fresh evidence
and report upon the whole question. The committee of seven, of whom
three, the Right Hon. E. S. Montagu (the chairman), Mr. E. G. B.
Meade-Waldo, and Mr. W. R. Oglivie-Grant, are distinguished members
of our Society, held fourteen meetings, and examined many witnesses,
representing the fishery, fruit-growing, and agricultural interests,
as well as ornithologists, landowners, and other persons concerned in
the preservation, capture, and destruction of our wild birds. The com-
mittee held its last meeting on July 28, 1914, and its arduous work
was practically completed when the outbreak of the European War in
August brought all such comparatively trivial matters to a standstill.
The continuance of hostilities delayed for five years the issue of the
minutes of the evidence taken before the committee, and of their
report based thereon. The former, however, was issued as a blue book,
and the latter as a white book in 1919, and subsequently a special
committee, with our member, Lord Grey of Fallodon, as chairman, was
nominated to consider the report before the drafting of a new Bill
on wild bird protection to be presented to Parliament.

B. I. Pocock -- The Proposed Nciv Bill for
Although it was known that the existing law had accomplished a
great deal in the preservation of bird-life, it had in some cases achieved
too much by leading to the local multiplication of certain common
species up to the point of converting them into pests ; while it had
notoriously failed to protect many very rare birds. The administration
of the law, moreover, had been rendered exceedingly difficult, owing to
the number and perplexing character of the orders that had been added
since the date of its coming into force ; and it was felt that its enforce-
ment was seriously obstructed by the inadequacy of the powers granted
to the police.
The recommendations contained in. the report of the Departmental
Committee are ably directed towards remedying these and other
defects. They are too numerous to mention in detail, but the most
important is the establishment of an Ornithological Advisory Committee
of experts, whose primary function would be to advise the central
authority on all matters connected with bird protection. Into their
other duties we need not now enter, but the immediate adoption of
that proposal is regarded as an essential step towards the scientific
administration of the law. Hardly less important are the extended
powers to be given to the police in the way of search and detention of
suspected persons ; of entry on private land, without permission of the
owner, for the purpose of preventing offences, and of seizure of bird,
egg, nest, or instrument suspected of being the subject of an offence.
It is, moreover, clearly and definitely to be laid down that the enforce-
ment of the law is as much one of the duties of the police as the enforce-
ment of the Diseases of Animals Act, or of similar measures connected
with the Ministry of Agriculture.
A tentative list of birds to be protected is contained in two schedules,
A and B. In schedule A, comprising species to be absolutely protected
during the breeding season, that is to say, from the 1st March to the

Black-tailed Godwit, Greenshank, Whimbrel, Red-necked Plialarope,
Snipe ; Stone Curlew ; Water Rail ; Quail. Capercailzie; Swans,
Ducks, Graylag Goose. Schedule B is composed of the following
species to be protected all the year round : Chough, Golden Oriole,
Crested Tit, Reedling or Bearded Tit, Dartford Warbler, St. Kilda
Wren; Hoopoe; Osprey, Kite, Harrier, Honey Buzzard, Common
Buzzard, Sea Eagle, Golden Eagle ; Long-eared Owl, Short-eared Owl,

<bodyText confidence="0.99937262962963" page_id="32670849"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
The species contained in schedule B sort themselves at a glance into
two groups, namely, those that are common but useful, like our
indigenous Owls; and those that are so rare that even if destructive
by nature the harm they effect is practically negligible. It is noticeable,
in passing, that protection formerly extended to the Little Owl, an
imported species, has been rightly withdrawn, because it preys upon
small birds. It thus adds one more instance to the many already on
record of the dangers of importing and releasing foreign species of
animals in strange lands ; and in connexion with this and similar cases
we welcome the recommendation of the committee that for the future
the liberation of non-British birds is to be strictly controlled.
On putting the two schedules together, it will be seen that protection
of one kind or another is afforded to practically all our birds of prey,
resident or visitant, apart from the Sparrow Hawk. Presumably this
species, certainly not the least attractive of our Accipitres, is omitted
for reasons similar to those that led to the removal of the Little Owl
from the list; but in connexion with the Peregrine it may perhaps be
doubted if the owners of grouse moors will note altogether with approval
the inclusion in schedule A of this rapacious, if beautiful, Falcon.
But to meet a case of this kind, and others possibly similar to it, where
a species may be a pest in one place and comparatively or actually
harmless in another, the wise recommendation is made that the local
authority may appeal to the central authority for extension or
shortening of the breeding season and for the removal of a particular
bird from either of the schedules. The Raven, for instance, is on the
protected list because of its extreme rarity in most English counties;
but application could be made for its exemption from protection in

II. I. Pococlc -- The Proposed Neiv Bill for
certain districts in Scotland, where it is sufficiently numerous to prove
a pest. Conversely, the local authority can apply to the central
authority for the addition of a particular species to either of the
schedules, if it is considered to be in need of protection in a particular
district; and the central authority would be guided in its decision by
the advice of the advisory committee of experts.
Even if space permitted a detailed enumeration of the species,
with the reasons for their recommendation for protection, such an
undertaking would be quite unnecessary in a journal owned and read
almost exclusively by ornithologists and bird-lovers. Possibly, how-
ever, the love of birds, which lies at the root of aviculture, may induce
some of the members of this Society to wish that the lists of protected
species had been longer. Two things, however, must be remembered ;
first, the Departmental Committee would not be likely to err on the
side of neglecting species that required protection ; and, secondly,
there were so many interests to be considered that all feelings due to
sentiment or to a taste for natural history had probably to be sacrificed
in many cases to purely economical and utilitarian demands. Few of
our birds, for instance, appeal more strongly to us on account of their
beauty, elegance, and vitality than the Tits ; but, setting aside the
Bearded Tit or Reedling, which is not a Titmouse at all, despite its
name, the only one that appears in the schedules is the Crested Tit,
which is exceedingly rare. The reason for their omission is, no doubt,
partly that these highly organized little birds are sufficiently numerous
to be exempted from protection -- and it was desirable to keep the lists
as short as possible--but more particularly that the evidence against
some of them, especially the Blue Tit and in a lesser degree the Great
Tit, on the charge of serious pecuniary loss inflicted on fruit-growers
is so overwhelming and so completely outweighs the evidence of the
benefit conferred by their insectivorous habits, that the proposal to
protect them would have provoked a storm of protest from owners of
orchards. And the same thing would have happened for precisely
similar reasons if recommendation had been made to extend the
guardianship of the law over that handsome finch of ours, the Bull-
finch. If birds of this kind were protected it is tolerably certain that
the law would be set at defiance by fruit-growers, because it would pay

them over and over again to shoot or trap the pests and run the risk
of being convicted and fined or even, alternatively, imprisoned without
the option of a fine. It is true that the recommendation to grant a
reward to any person giving information which results in a conviction
would increase the likelihood of detection of an offender. Still, we
believe that chance would be taken in the cases cited above, and others
similar to them.
Under the heading " miscellaneous ", various minor, but admittedly
important, points were considered. The question, for instance, of
bird-catchers, birdshop-keepers, and taxidermists was carefully
examined, and resulted in the recommendation that the two first should
be licensed, and, further, that there should be regular and careful
inspection of shops and places where birds are kept, with a view to
the prevention of the keeping of birds under bad conditions. This
measure, involving supervision of the trade and more particularly,
we hope, the methods of packing for importation of foreign birds, will
be welcomed by all true aviculturists. Another trade concerned with
wild birds is that of taxidermy, and in this connexion it is recommended
that for the future it shall be illegal for a taxidermist to have in his
possession, for whatever purpose, any illegally taken bird, egg, or nest.
The question of enforcing the keeping by taxidermists of registers
open to inspection by authorized persons was also discussed ; but,
although no strong recommendation was made on the point, it is
abundantly clear that the committee was in favour of the suggestion.
There is one other little point to be mentioned in connexion with our
home birds, namely, the protection of lighthouses which, as is well
known, are a source of serious recurrent mortality, especially to
migratory species. Since the provision of perches by Trinity House
has proved in many cases an effective means of salvation, the committee
advises that suitable perches be provided on all lighthouses on and
around our coasts.
The bird fauna of the United Kingdom is so intimately connected
with that of Continental Europe, especially through the medium of
migratory species, that the consideration of international co-operation
in bird protection could not escape the attention of the committee,
and naturally the so-called Paris Convention of 1902, the main term of

which was directed towards the absolute protection of the nests, eggs,
young, and adults of certain species scheduled as useful to agriculture,
was thoroughly discussed, and the reason for the non-adherence thereto
of the British Government carefully inquired into. The articles of the
Convention were critically examined and, subject to the clearing up of
some obscure points and to the adoption of a few suggested
modifications, it was decided to recommend that the Convention should
be adopted by His Majesty's Government, and that the necessary
amendments in the law should be incorporated in the new Act outlined
in the committee's report.
The birds scheduled in the French lists as useful and protected,
noxious and unprotected, compare very curiously with ours in some
respects, and show how circumstances may alter cases. One suspects,
indeed, that with our neighbours the utilitarian prevails over the artistic
rather more than it does with us. All the true birds of prey, including
the Osprey and the Kite, which we prize so highly, are in the noxious
list. So, too, are the Bittern, the Divers, and the Raven. Obvious
differences of opinion on the subject of useful birds also hold on the
two sides of the Channel. For example, the Little Owls and all the
Tits, including the Blue, are protected on the Continent, the Blue Tit
presumably in accordance with the view, formerly prevalent with us,
that its insectivorous diet places it amongst a nation's valuable assets.
It is necessary to bear in mind, however, that a bird's habits may vary
with its station, or change from time to time according to circumstances
--a fact sometimes lost sight of by those who maintain that the fresh
inquiry held by the Departmental Committee into the food and mode
of life of our wild birds was merely waste of time, seeing that the whole
question was, it is claimed, thoroughly investigated and settled once
and for all when the original bill for protection was passed some half-
century ago.
A natural sequence to the consideration of the French Con-
vention was the recommendation that the policy by v r hich the
British Government had in certain cases refrained in the past
from taking part officially in international conferences on the
subject of bird protection should be reversed, and that this country
should for the future be represented officially at such conferences,

and take its share in their promotion. By this means it was felt
Great Britain would be able to keep in touch with work done in
other countries, and to assist in propaganda in favour of adequate
protection in those countries, which have so far refrained from taking
satisfactory measures to that end.
Finally, since no report in regard to international action for the
protection of birds would be complete without a reference to the danger
arising from the wholesale destruction of certain birds for the sake of
their plumage, the committee concludes its report with the expression
of the hope that, as soon as international conditions permit, the
proposals put forward on this subject by the committee appointed by
Lord Crewe in 1912 will be revived, and that an earnest endeavour will
be made to secure a satisfactory international convention on the lines
then suggested.

By F. G. Hedges
In 1920 a pair of Gang-gang Cockatoos were obtained, the cock
a newly imported bird, the hen an acclimatized bird, from the
Marquess of Tavistock. On arrival they were placed in separate cages
until an aviary was built for them, this being 16 feet long, 14 feet wide,
and 12 feet high in the centre. The reason for this being higher ir&amp;gt;
the centre is to allow them to get high up oi.t of reach, and to fix
a nesting-barrel high up, as it is their natural habit, I believe, when
wild, to nest in very high trees. This evidently pleased them, as they
w r ere nearly always in the higher part, which has a dead pear-tree for
perching. This part is covered about 3 feet square with board and zinc,
to give them protection from the sun and to form a dry shelter for them.
Under this was placed a 5 gallon wine-cask, the end being covered with
1 in. board and zinc, with a 31 in. entrance, the zinc being to prevent
them cutting a larger hole. They have also a covered shelter, 14 feet
long, 3 ft. 6 in. wide, with perch and a dead pear-tree. This is covered
in front about 3 feet down wdth boards from the roof. They have

the first egg. On the 6th I saw the second egg, and this was the last
laid. The birds took no notice of me looking into their nest whatever.
During incubation, when the hen came off to feed, the cock took her
place. One strange thing I noticed was that the hen always came off
in the afternoons, when the cock would take her place ; she would be
off from one and a half to two hours.
The first egg hatched on 4th July ; this young one died next day.
I removed this and now have it preserved in alcohol. When removing
the dead chick I saw that the second egg was about to hatch, and it
hatched out on the 6th. The young were covered with a rusty red
down. Eight days after I again looked into the nest and could see
that the young one had grown and was being well attended to. They
were left quiet, and I did not look again until the young one was a
month old, as I could hear it in the nest. On looking again at one month
I could see that the young one was covered with feather-stubs of a
grey-blue colour, those on the wings, tail and chest being longer than
those on the body. At six weeks 1 could see that it was a cock bird,
as the colour commenced to show on the crest. After this he gained
feather very quickly, and during the eleventh week I saw him looking
out of the nest. On the morning of 4th September I found the young
bird sitting on the dead pear-tree, and was pleased to see a fine strong
bird, and in no way wild for a young one. He resembled the hen-bird
in form and colour, but he had a red crest, but not so bright as the
old bird, with only a few red feathers on the cheeks, and also a dark
streak each side of the beak. The young bird could fly well, and could
often be seen at the feeding tray with the old ones. If a stranger entered
the aviary the hen would commence to cry loudly, and the cock would
fly to the young one, as if to guard it from danger. During October
I caught the young one up and placed it in the larger bird room, where
it is doing well.
I am curious to see at what age the Gang-gang Cockatoo obtains
the complete scarlet helmet. I find the Gang-gang hardy, and in no
way affected by the cold, as long as they have a good dry shelter to go
into. Their food is sunflower, Avheat, oats, hemp, and canary-seed,
white boiled maize, bread and milk, and a little pear or apple. The
Gang-gang is a very interesting bird when in a large aviary. Their

The formation of the Transcontinental Railway which links Western
Australia to South Australia has opened up a. considerable amount of
more or less unexplored country, and it was only to be expected that
nev types of birds would be discovered. A very interesting one, from
the aviculturists' point of view is described and illustrated in the
October number of the Emu, by Mr. H. L. White, a well-known
Australian ornithologist. It is a typical " Blue-bonnet " Parrakeet,
but differs considerably in coloration from the well-known red-vented
and yellow-vented forms. The forehead and lores are verditer green,
the ultamarine blue of the other species being confined in the hen-bird
to the cheeks. There is more yellow on the wing-coverts than in the
commoner species, and the rump is a brighter yellow.
Mr. H. L. White had secured the services of Mr. F. L. Whitlock, an
experienced bird collector, to explore the western portion of the great
Nullarbor Plain. A camp was formed at Zanthus, some 130 miles east
of Kalgoorlie, where there is a station on the new line, and here the
collector discovered a Parrakeet in a cage, the property of one of the
railway officials. It appeared to be different from any species he knew,
and he ascertained that it had been captured at Naretha, some 75 miles
to the east. Proceeding thither, he was soon able to secure specimens
which, on comparison, proved to be new to science. The bird has been
named Psephotus naretkce by Mr. White.

MONS. DELACOUR IN VENEZUELA

<bodyText confidence="0.97914475" page_id="32670858"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
Mr. Astley has received two letters from Monsieur Delacour
dated 21st November and 28th December, 1921, from Caracas, where
he had arrived on his way into Venezuela, in which country he is
collecting birds, hoping to be able to bring home some humming birds
in the spring, and many other species.
(1) "I have not been in the country yet, but in the town and suburbs
I have seen a good many Tanagers, Saffron Finches, Siskins (presumably
Chrysomitris cucullatus --H. D. A.), Keskadees, etc. Bird life is
plentiful. The bird market, of course, is the great attraction. I have
already bought a few birds, amongst them some wonderful and rare
Tanagers from the Andes. Calliste arthusi, the shape of the Superb
Tanager, head and chest golden orange, two black spots on the cheeks,
back, wings, and tail orange and black, sides of breast chestnut. Also
C. cyanoptera, crown black, head and back silver blue, throat silver-
green, the rest blue-black. Quite a number of Euphonias, head sky-
blue, neck and upper parts dark blue, underparts orange. I have also
other Euphonias and C. guttata, desmaresti, and nigriviridis. Red
Siskins and Mules (Canary and Red Siskin) and White-bellied Cardinals
are easily obtainable, but more expensive than the rare birds ! I also
have two nice species of Yellow and Black Siskins. I hope to get a
car this week, and will then begin to visit the interior of the country.
I have introductions to a number of very kind Englishmen living all
over Venezuela, and I am going to stay with several of them in the
interesting parts."
(2) " I am leaving Venezuela on Saturday for Trinidad. I have
seen a good part of the country, and want to see something
else. I shall stay a fortnight in Trinidad and shall go to the
Guy anas or Cayenne, where wild life is, I am told, wonderful.
Venezuela is by no means a beautiful country, and life is difficult here.
But birds are plentiful and very interesting. I have seen nearly all
that I was expecting to see. In the north of the country small birds
are very numerous. Tanagers of all sorts, Humming Birds, Tyrants,

a beastly, hot, ugly, flat plain, with enormous but dirty rivers, the
Waders are in millions. You see all the time big flocks of Egrets, Scarlet
Ibises, Storks, and Herons of all sorts, etc. Tree Ducks are abundant,
and every hundred yards a pair of Orinoco Geese can be seen on the
banks, which are covered with huge alligators and caimans. But I shall
give you a better account viva voce. I brought from the Apure, on a
Ford lorry, a nice collection of animals and birds, either given to me
or caught by my man. A young tame tiger cat, a pair of young tame
Capybaras (!), and a mother silver-grey Agouti (a rare species) with her
son (absolutelv tame), a pair of young Snake Birds ( Anhingas ), four
Rosy-billed Tree Ducks, three Orinoco Geese, some Curassows and
Guans, two little Blue Hens, a Sun Bittern, some Macaws and Parrots,
Parrakeets, some Calliste, twenty Paroaria nigrigenis, that you
can only find on the Apure and Orinoco, some Troupials, a King
Vulture. I had some beautiful Herons, but they died on the journey,
which is really terrible, as you have to cross 500 km. of plain, without
roads !
I have here an excellent collection of Tanagers, eight species which
have never been seen in Europe, quite a number of small birds--and
a delicious little Rail, a miniature Moorhen, grey and black, not bigger
than a Sparrow, and quite tame. I caught a number of Jacanas, but
they don't live. I have some Talpacoti and Scaly Doves, which are
very common here. You can imagine how difficult it is to carry all this
Zoo behind me, but I hope to get all these things in good health into
Europe in the spring."
It is to be hoped that Monsieur Delacour will keep a diary, which
should be most interesting reading.

AVICULTURE IN JAPAN

Thinking that some readers of this Magazine are interested in the
cage-birds of Japan, and also in the manner the Japanese keep these
birds, I am writing an article on the aviculture of Japan. For a
considerable time the Japanese have kept both native and foreign
birds in cages. Japanese history tells us that for the last 1.700 years
the Japanese Bush Warbler was kept for the sake of its beautiful
song, and that the Parrots, Peacocks, and Magpies have been imported
from Corea for over 1,000 years.
During this period many times we have had both progress and
retrogression of this art, and about 100 years ago it was at its highest
point, when we arrived at the present method of keeping birds.
During this epoch we have had many books on the subject of bird-
keeping, and many foreign birds were bred and reared in cages and
aviaries, such as the Mannikins, Pheasants, Peafowl, Ducks, and some
species of Soft-bills and Parrots, especially the Temmink's Robin,
the White-headed Black Bulbul, the Hill Mynah, and the Purple-
capped Lory, which were bred in outdoor aviaries, and it is said that
the Crested Sheldrake was profusely imported from either Corea or
China during this time.
The Crested Sheldrake is now so scarce that there are only two
specimens in existence in the world, and even these are only stuffed
specimens.

N. Taka-Tsukasa -- Aviculture in Japan
At present the aviculture of Japan is progressing rapidly, and many
bird-lovers are eagerly studying it. In the Meiji years this was much
neglected, and I think that the aviculturist of Japan will soon arrive
at the same level on this subject as the Europeans. Last year an
avicu]tural society began to hold its meetings in Tokyo. These are
held every other month.
The Japanese aviculturists separate the cage birds, as Europeans
do, into two groups, namely, the seed-eaters or hard-bills and the
insect-eaters or soft-bills.
(a) Seed-eaters or Hard-bills
The Japanese bird-lovers give this group of birds chiefly various
kinds of millet (the Japanese name is Awa), Panicum miliaceum (Kibi)
and Panicum frumentaceum (Hiye), in the same manner as the canary
seed and millet are used by the Europeans, and also, in like manner as
the Europeans, the Japanese mix any two kinds of Panicum , which
I mentioned above, in the same quantity for their food, and often add
the seed of Pellira ocimoides, hemp and rape, in such proportion as
one-sixth of the whole part of millets. This seed diet can be got from
either the bird fanciers' or cereal shops.
We have no canary seed in Japan now, but about 100 years ago,
when the first pair of Canary birds were introduced into Japan, the
canary seed was also brought into Japan and was sown as the food for
the Canary birds, but some time after the Japanese found that the
above-mentioned kinds of millets could be substituted for the canary
seed, and they stopped the cultivation of the canary seed, so it has
become extinct.
With respect to the caging of birds, we use the box-cage generally
now, though sometimes a rectangular bar-cage is used for that purpose.
The Japanese box-cage is the same as the European one in its principle,
but in dimension the height of the cage is greater than the length or
width, and the box has in addition to the front door an entrance near
the top of the side or at the back of the cage, and the door slides in
sideways, while the door at the front slides up and down. This side
entrance is used for taking the artificial nest in or out from the cage.
The box-cage generally has a paper screen on the front for the purpose

of protecting the bird from cold at night in the winter, and damp and
chilly air in damp weather, and against the mosquitoes in the summer.
In the latter case we place a mosquito net on the slide in place of
the paper.
The artificial nest is made of straw, a saucer-shaped one being
used for the Canary birds and a jar-shaped one for the Mannikins
and Waxbill, but I personally found, for the Canary birds, an unglazed
pottery saucer, called " Kawarake " by the Japanese, is more useful
than straw ones, and the jar-shaped one is unfit for breeding, though
it is quite enough to sleep in at night, for it is too small for the nest.
I use a small box for the nest of the Mannikins and Waxbills, and I get
good results.
For the material of nest-building we use generally a kind of rootlet
called " Ivarukava " by the Japanese aviculturists, and it is sold at
the bird fanciers, but a waste swab can be used successfully, and it is
less expensive than using " Karukaya ". The Japanese call the swab
" Pawashi ", and this is made of the same rootlets as " Karukaya ".
The Japanese bird fanciers' shops sell branches of Niwatoko (elder)
for perches. The branch of this tree is soft and very handy for making
a perch. The old Japanese bird-lovers think that this tree is beneficial
for the birds' legs, and often used the extracts of the branches and leaves
of it for a lotion, which is used for broken wings or legs, the injured
part being wrapped in a cloth which has been dipped in this extract.
We strew the floor of the cage with sand, and do not use other
materials for that purpose excepting old newspapers.
The cage, food, and water receptacles and other things which are
used in bird-keeping are obtained from the bird fanciers' shops, but
food or water receptacles are also sold in china shops, and the parrot
cage can also be purchased from the ironmongers' shops and the sand
from the builders.
The most popular and commonest Hard-bill which is kept in a cage
in Japan is the Canary bird. The Canary bird is bred in great numbers
by peasants and old men of the towns who have spare time, and, of
course, by bird-lovers. The most noted localities where the people
breed the Canaries are the outskirts of the city of Nagoya and the coasts
of the inland sea.

The Canary birds of Japan are chiefly the offspring of the German
Rollers and the curled-feathered race, though the latter are less in
number than the former. The breed has now become inferior in all
respects to the original stock, for new blood has not been imported
during the Great War, and therefore inter-breeding in small circles
has been the result. But fortunately we have new stock now, though
the numbers are small from the native land, so they will be soon
improved, and the Green Canaries has been imported too.
Before the Great War we had often very good specimens of Lanca-
shire Coppy, Yorkshire Coppy, and Belgian Fancy Canaries, but they
have all nearly vanished from the cage-birds of Japan.
The Japanese did not try cayenne feeding till last year, when Mr. T.
Takano, of Yokohama, tried this experiment, and has succeeded in
getting some colour-fed birds from the Japanese stock.
We get generally two or three broods a year, but if the birds are
in good condition we have one more brood in the autumn.
Just before the breeding season comes we give the seed of Pellira
ocimoides or rape, and in the breeding season we add a little quantity
of the yolk of an egg boiled and chopped fine to the above mentioned
seed.
The history of the importation of Canary birds in Japan, according
to a " cage-bird " book which was published about 100 years ago,
is as follows : The Canary birds were imported many years ago, before
this book was published, but the birds were all males, consequently
the Japanese could not get any fledglings ; but about forty years ago an
European (probably Dutch) brought a pair of Canary birds to Nagasaki,
from which he got many broods. The governor of Nagasaki received
a present of the parent birds from the European, and brought them back
to Yedo (now Tokyo), and he gave them to a Shogun knight. This
knight attempted to get young birds from this jrair, but he failed the
first year. However, the next year he succeeded, and had many birds
in a few years. These birds he sold and gave away, and so the Canaries
were soon distributed in all parts of Japan.
I have little information on the subject of mule birds, but it is said
that the Canaries are crossed with the Siskins and Japanese Green-
finches ; so far I have not yet met with such birds. I have heard
recently Mr. Takano has succeeded in getting such mule birds.

Bengalee or Pied Mannikin. This bird is also very popular in
Japan, and is divided into three varieties by the bird-lovers according
to coloration : firstly, the albino, in which the plumage is all white, and
it has flesh-coloured bill and legs, but the eyes are not red; secondly,
the cinnamon and white bird ; and thirdly, the dark-brown and white
bird. The markings of these varieties are bold and irregular, and the
bill is black on the upper mandible and flesh-coloured on the lower,
and the legs of these two varieties are equally flesh-coloured.
The box-cage suits this bird the best, because it has been hatched
and lived all its life for over 100 years in such a box-cage, so the con-
stitution of this bird has become quite adapted to a box-cage, and
generally it is too delicate to live in an aviary or a large cage.
This bird can also stand very simple diet, which consists of any one
kind of millet, and this is the only bird which accepts the artificial
nest sold at the bird fanciers' shops without any alterations having
to be made to it. The artificial nest for this bird is jar-shaped, and if
we give it some materials for nest-building it instantly makes a nest and
hatches its eggs, and as soon as its young leave the nest it lays another
clutch M eggs ; thus it gives us many broods through a year, but
generally we have two broods in the spring and the same in the
autumn.
The number of a clutch of eggs is either three or four, and the
fledglings can easily be reared, as they are generally very strong and
the parents take great care of their young. As this bird has generally
a very good nature it is often (nearly in all cases) used as a foster-
mother for the Zebra Finches, Gouldian Finches, and other rare species
of the ornamental Finches.
An old Japanese book on the cage-birds tells us that this bird
comes from China, and in the original species the upper parts are dark
brown and the breast and abdomen are white with pale dusky streaks.
Its bill is black and the legs are pale bluish-grey, and its tail is long and
pointed. According to this description I think that the Bengalee
comes from the Sharp-tail Finch (Uroloncha acuticauda), which is
a common bird in the southern parts of China, Formosa, and other
tropical parts of Asia.
This bird was imported into Japan about 200 years ago, and during

fifty years it was distributed in all parts of Japan, but still during this
time it seems that the White and Cinnamon varieties did not appear.
The Bengalee can be easily crossed with any of the other varieties
of its kind, or such Mannikins as the Sharp-tail Finch and&apos; Spice
bird. The mules between this bird and Sharp-tail Finch, which were
hatched in my aviary, are similar to the Sharp-tail Finch, but the skin
of the mule-birds is always white.
The Java Sparrow is also one of the most familiar birds of Japan.
It is a favourite with the Japanese artists, and it is often painted in
pictures. There are three varieties. The first is the common grey
bird, which is the most numerous of the three, and every year great
numbers are imported into Japan, besides those that are bred in this
country. The second one is the White Java Sparrow, which is chiefly
bred in Japan, and the third is a brown one, whose upper parts are
dark brown, with white cheeks, the head is the darkest. The under-
parts are yellowish brown, except the breast, which is the same colour
as the upper parts, and a dark-brown band runs across the lower
breast, which is separated by this band from the abdomen. Some
persons think this variety is a hybrid between the Java Sparrow
and the Zebra Finch. The third variety is the rarest.
We keep the Java Sparrow in a box-cage as we keep the Canaries
which I have already mentioned in this article, but we use a small
box for its nest instead of the saucer-shaped artificial nest. The box
is similar to those which are used by the Europeans for an artificial
nest for the Mannikin or Waxbill. This artificial box-nest can be
obtained from the bird fanciers' shops. We have generally two broods
in a season.
In Nagoya, where this bird is chiefly bred, the bird fanciers rear the
young birds in the following manner : They separate the young birds
from their parents (either natural or foster) when they are about a week
old and rear them by the hand.
At first the fanciers divide the fledglings into two or three groups,
according to the strength of the birds, their diet consisting of a paste
made of crushed millet, dried river fish, and greens.
The fancier attaches this paste to a bamboo spatula, with which he
pushes the food into the birds' mouths. The young birds soon learn.

<bodyText confidence="0.992946583333334" page_id="32670875"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
this method of feeding, and as soon as a man comes to the cage they
open their mouths and take the paste from the spatula skilfully.
While the fancier feeds the fledglings in this manner, he sorts out the
groups again and again as soon as he finds some weaker birds in a group.
This method of rearing gives the fancier less loss than he would
have if he left them to their parents until they were old enough to leave
them naturally, and by this method he often obtains one more brood
than is usual.
The fancier needs the assistance of two or three men's hands,
including his own, to rear about 500 to 7,000 fledglings to maturity.
The White Java Sparrow, I have heard, was produced at Nagoya,
and obtained from some common grey birds which had some
white plumes in the wing, but I think this refers to the origin of the
white bird in Japan. The white birds were probably produced in
China earlier than the Japanese birds, and it seems that there is no
relationship between the stock of Nagoya and that of China.
The Zebra Finches are also bred numerously in Japan, but this
bird is not allowed generally to hatch its eggs itself, for what reason
I do not know, but the fanciers use the Bengalee hen as a foster-mother
to hatch its eggs and rear its young. But personally I have reared many
fledglings without using the Bengalee. The Zebra Finch breeds freely
in an aviary if it has been accustomed to the aviary life, as this bird
is chiefly reared by Nagoya fanciers Avho keep the birds always in box-
cages, so its wings generally are not strong enough when it is put into
an aviary to fly about at once and freely. This bird thrives well on
the diet which I have mentioned before, and also endures an outdoor
life in the winter.
Recently the Gouldian Finch has been bred in Japan in fairly
large numbers. But the young birds are very delicate until they finish
their first moult. The hatching of the Gouldian Finch is done either
by using the Bengalee as a foster-mother or by the parents themselves.
The newly imported birds are also very delicate, and the hen is apt
to suffer from egg-binding when she first lays.
The following foreign Finches are commonly seen in the cages of
the bird fanciers' shops in great numbers : the Amanduvade, Spice
Bird, Sharp-tailed Finch and Black-headed Nun. The Diamond Finch,

are often inported, but not so numerous as the former mentioned birds.
Generally the African Finches are imported less than those of
Tropical Asia and Australia. All these birds and &quot;Weavers and
Whydahs are quite hardy in the Japanese winter, especially after their
first winter. I Rave had some Weavers and Whydahs in my outdoor
aviary without any heat in winter for ten years, and they are now in
quite the same condition as they were when imported. Of course, this
aviary has glass screens for protection against the bad weather.
The Japanese generally keep the newly imported birds in box-
cages during the first winter and the rainy season, which is as bad as
the cold winter for the delicate and weak birds in Japan, as well as
newly imported birds.
We put the cage in a sunny place in the daytime and a warm room
at night or on chilly days, and from my personal experience it is not
necessary to heat this room unless the weather is damp. Generally
the front of the box-cage is covered with a paper screen.
Personally I advise that it is better to remove the nest-boxes from
the aviaries in which birds are kept that have come from the southern
hemisphere, because they are apt to breed in winter, and they will
often get egg-bound.

The British birds were a remarkably good collection of exceptional
specimens of their kinds. Among the more interesting sections we
noticed a Great Grey Shrike, an exceptionally good Wryneck, Gold-
crest, and Common Redstart, which have done many rail journeys
to shows and were immaculate. There were also Waxwings, Cross-
bills, Hawfinches, Blue-headed, Grey and Yellow Wagtails, Nightin-
gales, Robins, Black-cap Warblers, Common, Cirl, Reed, Snow, and
Yellow Buntings, some good Thrushes and Blackbirds. The
remarkable thing to many who never remove their birds from their
living quarters is that most exhibition birds live longer, look better,
and become more charming in demeanour than birds that are kept in
one place. The excitement evidently is healthful.

By Frederick D. Welch
During visits to tlie London Zoological Gardens in 1920 and 1921
I watched two of the above from North-West Africa, the last visit
being in August, and as they were nice-looking birds it seemed to be
worth writing a description of them. But writing accounts of active
healthy Falcons which are often on the move about their cage in
flight is by no means so easy a task as writing from museum
specimens which can be handled ; and this must be my excuse if
there should be any omission in the following account.
In general colour they were brown, darker in shade on back and
wings, with neck and head paler, the latter having the crown dark
anteriorly, paler posteriorly, with some narrow longitudinal dark
streaks, and a central dark patch at back of head.
On the face were two dark conspicuous marks, one on each side,
starting about i inch below the eyes and running downwards and
outwards as they descended. The iris was dark, beak blackish.
The breast was pale in general colour, but streaked with dark
longitudinal blotches, and the pale feathers around legs had thin
dark streaks down them (apparently in centre of each feather): the
feet and hare metatarsus being yellow. The tails were dark with
pale crossbars.
In flight they moved gracefully and rapidly, and on one occasion
a Falcon captured a Sparrow just before I arrived at its cage, and
when seen by me was holding the prey in its toes quite dead.
I did not myself see the chase, but Avas told by a man Avho did
that the Falcon proceeded silently and uttered no noise before the
flight, in this agreeing Avith the silent dash of the Corean Sea Eagle
(Haliaetus branichii) already recorded (Avicultural Magazine,
1920, p. 55). Judging from these cases and others seen by me in
wild state, the feet of Falcons and Eagles are alone used in the
actual killing of birds, the grip of toes stopping the heart and lung
action of the prey, and the beak is not used as Avith Bateleur Eagles
and others against poisonous snakes (Avicultural Magazine, 1921,

commencing to tear up the head first, then other parts.
These Erlanger Falcons (Falco biarmicus erlangeri ) looked to be
about 16 or 17 inches long.
I have been unable from want of time and from other reasons to
look up specimens in museum or book accounts of adult plumage,
but have an impression that the above is immature plumage. Is
this so ?
Since August, 1921,1 have not seen either bird.

Some very interesting correspondence on the speed of the flight
of birds has been published recently in the Field, and amongst the
various letters one from the pen of the Marquess of Tavistock is of
considerable interest to aviculturists. The Black-tailed Parrakeet is
perhaps better known to aviculturists as the " Rock Pebbler " or

the world, and also one of the most superbly graceful on the wing.
I have kept a young male of this species at liberty for some months
past, together with the nearly allied Barraband's parrakeet and the
common Indian Ringneck, and have thus been able to compare the
speed of the three species with one another and with native British
birds. Very few of the latter can equal the pace of the Ringneck,
which, when alarmed, is an exceedingly swift bird ; but it is quite a poor
flyer by comparison with the Barraband, and the Barraband is a little
slower than the Blacktail. I have often watched the latter on a fine
morning dashing round and round at an almost incredible speed, now
turning and twisting over the grass, now diving through the branches,
until one would think that only a miracle could save him from being
knocked to pieces. The sight is a wonderfully beautiful one, but
unluckily a second bird of the same species, which I released last summer,

did not prove as great a success. A Brown Owl attacked it the first
night it was at liberty,- and, dashing away in the darkness, it lost its
bearings and never returned home. It was seen on one or two occasions,
and I hoped to recover it, as it was quite tame ; but my hopes seem
likely to remain unfulfilled, unless some reader should know of its
capture. It is a greenish yellow bird, darker green on the wings, with
some of the secondaries red, and a long tail, black above and pinkish
underneath. The size is about that of a tame pigeon."

By Hubert D. Astley
I still have five pre-war Flamingoes (I believe the only ones in
England) which have never been shut in during the winters. This
year they have on three occasions been frozen in, so that for two or
three days and nights at a time they have stood closely packed in a
small pool of water, surrounded by ice, which they have managed to
keep from being frozen by movement of feet and beaks. From
experience they have learnt that it is risky and inadvisable to walk on
the ice, for when they did so they constantly slipped up and were in
danger of fractured legs.
It is astonishing that birds which would naturally be in Egypt can
not only stand the cold, but are able to endure it without any exercise
for forty-eight hours and more. It is useless to break the ice, for it
only scares them and matters would be worse (and have been) than
better. In fact, the remedy is worse than the disease.
When the thaws arrive their joy is great, and in open water once
more they rush about with carmine and black wings extended, until
one wonders how they can possibly avoid breaking their legs.
In February I had a shock on seeing one morning that the female
Stanley Crane was enclosed in ice half-way up her legs, having roosted
(as she and her mate always do) in the water. Luckily the ice was
not strong enough to hold her, and after a great effort she freed herself,
jumped on to the harder ice, and walked ashore, much to her mate's
delight and hers, for they proceeded to dance a fandango. On another

occasion last January, when an evening party had been given to the
employees, I ivas seeing some guests off at 12.45 a.m., and as it was
freezing very sharply I walked out in the brilliant moonlight to have
a look at the Flamingoes, when I descried two grey forms (looking
almost white) in the ice of the moat vdiich surrounds the house. It
was the pair of Stanley Cranes already frozen in ! What horrible
moments these are ! It was noAV or never, for before morning I could -
see that the ice rvould be too hard for them to break ; consequently
I threw stones at them, which shot over the ice with resounding ringing
chimes ; and to my relief first one crane and then the other struggled
out and made for the shore. This roosting in the water is perhaps
resorted to in Africa, where they would be safe from animals of prey,
and would probably be in some lagoon where there were no crocodiles.
AnyhoAV it proves that Stanley Cranes, once acclimatized, are
extremely hardy.

Copy for the Magazine.-- The greatest difficulty the Editors of
the Magazine experience is to find sufficient copy to fill the journal.
There are many members who keep birds, and who must have had
interesting experiences, who never write them down for the benefit
of their fellow aviculturists. We appeal to those members to send
us their avicultural notes whether they think they are worth publishing
or not. We can judge as to this when we receive them, and probably
we shall find that they are most useful.
The Commoner Species. --Many members seem to imagine that
the commoner birds, such, for instance, as Zebra Finches, Cordon
Bleus, or Budgerigars, are not worth writing about, but that all that
the members want is matter dealing with very rare species. We
want to impress upon our members that this is not the case, for it must
be remembered that there are a number of new members who are quite
beginners in aviculture, and the experience of others in the keeping and
breeding of the commoner species would be of the greatest value to
them.
Pioneers in Aviculture.-- We most of us remember the pride

Stray Notes
we took in the first birds we bred, how delighted Ave were when the
first young Cockatiel or Budgerigar made its appearance into the world,
and hoAV eagerly we read up every scrap of published information
on the subject that \A r e could find. Greene and Gedney were the two
authorities we placed our faith in, and to these two pioneers great
credit is due for having implanted a love of aviculture in many of those
who are now quite old hands at it.
Early Successes and Failures. -- Do not let us forget that a new
generation of aviculturists is springing up, and let us give them freely
of our experience. Let us write of our early successes and failures
instead of waiting until we think we have qualified for a medal.
The Bengalese.-- Mr. Taka-Tsukasa's article which is com-
menced in the present number reminds us that Japanese and Chinese
birds have practically disappeared from the European bird market
since the war. The little Bengalese in its three varieties has not been
seen for years. It is an extraordinary little bird which is happier
in a small cage than anywhere else. It nests freely in any cage, and
if you keep a number together the hens will all lay in the same nest
and rear their young indiscriminately, and if you like to change their
eggs for those of any other small ornamental Finch they do not mind,
but will carefully hatch them and foster the chicks as if they were
their own.
Japanese Aviculture. --The Japanese appear to be getting very
keen on aviculture, according to Mr. Taka-Tsukasa, and we think our
members will be interested in his article, which will be continued in
the next number. We much hope that British aviculturists are not
becoming less keen, but we fear their numbers are considerably less
than they were before the war. An exchange of experiences between
the Japanese and ourselves will be very useful, and we hope will
stimulate both.
Snow Geese. --The Zoological Society has acquired from Mr.
BlaaiiAV a very nice pair of Ross's Snow Goose (Chen rossi ), which is
much the smallest of the three or four forms of Snow Geese. It occurs
in Arctic America, migrating south as far as Western California in
winter. The Snow Geese are rather puzzling. There are the three
white forms which differ from one another only in size. The largest,

Chen nivalis, nesting in the Hudson Bay region and migrating along
the Atlantic coast; the lesser, C. liyperboreus, breeding in Western
Arctic America and Alaska, migrating to the Pacific coast; and the
small Ross's above mentioned. Are these good species or subspecies ?
Then, again, the greatest puzzle is the Blue Snow Goose ( Chen
ccerulescens), which, except for colour, is identical with C. nivalis, with
which it also associates, but its colour is chiefly bluish-grey. It seems
probable that this and the white form are colour phases of the same
species, a case of dimorphism.

A NOISY BIRD

<bodyText confidence="0.998462090909091" page_id="32670883"  page_num="29" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --In the Magazine for last July Mr. F. D. Welch asks whether
the fact that the examples of Garrulax picticollis seen by him were
remarkably silent birds was due to their being females. I am afraid
I cannot answer as to the sex of those which he saw, but I do know
from personal experience, and from what Mr. Fulljames told me about
a specimen which he possessed, that G. picticollis not only has a harsh
chattering song, but whenever it wants to call attention to itself it
utters an incessant irritating plaintive whistle. When this noise can
be heard by neighbours they will speedily complain of the nuisance
and you will have to get rid of the bird.

Sirs, --I understand that you are short of " copy " for the Magazine,
and that we, the members of the Society, are so remiss in writing
articles, or else have so little of interest to write about, that a moment
has come when the question arises whether we can continue to publish
a number each month or not.
On a former and a similar occasion I proposed that the Magazine
should be published bi-monthly, thereby issuing six numbers a year
instead of twelve ; by these means having more articles and more
money to expend on each number. But many members, I remember,
objected to this suggestion.

Correspondence
May I make another, and, as far as I know, a new proposal ? It
is this. The very subject of birds is, in my most humble opinion,
in grave danger of being over-written. Such reams of print have
appeared during the last few years, and are still appearing, about birds
that there is really very little that is new to be written, and many
people are beginning to feel somewhat nauseated by this constant
serving-up to these feasts of avicultural nourishment. This more
particularly applies to our hobby of the keeping of birds in
confinement. The same round of experiences, minor successes and
disappointments, and small events are recorded, slightly disguised,
time after time.
What I venture, with trepidation, to suggest is this. Why not
enlarge our scope, our outlook, and our interests 1 Why, in fact, should
we confine ourselves to birds ? Why not, still keeping birds as our
major interest, lend our pages to descriptions of our members' other
pets, those with fur instead of feathers 1 Many of us do not keep only
birds, but have as well all sorts of small mammals.
If a member keeps Golden Agoutis, as I used to, at large in his
garden, or if he has a Coatimundi, an Armadillo, or any other out-of-
the-way pet, let him write and tell of it in the pages of the Magazine.
I am prepared to wager that the result will be a larger Magazine,
more interesting, and more original articles each month, and, as a result,
an increase in membership. I offer this as a suggestion, hoping that if
it does nothing else it will bring forth a better scheme from some other
member, which will lead to the rejuvenation of the Avicultural
Magazine. We could then take as our club motto that noble line of
English verse (the name of the poet at this moment escapes my
memory) : " Happy homes and hairy faces."
Philip Gosse.
[We hope our members will freely express their views on this
subject. -- Eds.]

(Continued from p. 22.)
The following Japanese Finches are commonly kept in cages,
and the Buntings are generally treated by the Japanese like the Soft-
bills, though some keep them on seed just like other Finches. The
Japanese Greenfinch and the Siskin are the commonest. Both are
very hardy and thrive well either in a cage or an aviary, and they have
a pretty song like a Canary, though they have not so many variations
in their song as the Canary has. They need more hemp in their diet
than the Canary bird and the Ornamental Finches.
The Mealy Red-poll, the Common Rose Finch, and Japanese Rose
Finch are kept for the sake of their coloration, so those birds which
are in captivity are generally males. They are less common and rather
delicate, but are very pretty birds, having bright rose-colour and
crimson red on their head, breast, and belly, and white on the wing.
We keep also the Bullfinch, the Japanese Grosbeak, and the Cross-
bill for their song and beauty ; the former two birds having a very
sweet song and their coloration being also as pretty as that of the
latter bird.
We have sometimes a pretty coloured variety of Bullfinch, which
has a rose throat and breast like the European Bullfinch, but the
former differs from the latter in that the cokmr of the throat and
breast are rose instead of the salmon colour. This beautiful variety

is called " Teri-Uso " by the Japanese, and that name means the
bright-coloured Bullfinch.
The Japanese Grosbeak is also called Masked Hawfinch, for it has
a black face. The colour of the body is grey with black wings and
tail, which have a bluish sheen. Its heavy bill is clear gamboge yellow,
and from this reason the Japanese also call this bird the Waxbill, as
the original Japanese wax is yellow in colour. The song of this bird
reminds one of the Japanese words for " Moon-star and Sun ", i.e.
" Tsuki-hoshi-hei This bird is very ill-tempered, so must not be
kept with any other birds which are weaker than itself.
The Crossbill comes to Japan very irregularly. We often have not
a single bird for a few years and then, on the contrary, we have some-
times so many that every bird fanciers' shop contains great numbers.
The following foreign Finches are imported into Japan in small
numbers, namely, the Chinese or Black-tailed Grosbeak, Goldfinch,
Green Singing Finch, and Red-crested Cardinal. The Crested Cardinal
is said to be bred in Japan, though I have no sure information on this
point. I have also often noticed that the Crossbill is kept in a wire
cage such as is commonly used for Parrots.
Besides the Finches and tbe Ornamental Finches there is another
common bird which is fed on seed diet, namely, the Varied Titmouse,
which is sold plentifully at the bird fanciers' shops in the autumn,
and it is fed on hemp seed and walnut instead of millet. It is very
hardy and clever, and is easily kept.
Some of these birds do such tricks as tumbling in the air through
a ring which is suspended from the top of the cage, or picking up a
piece of walnut from a toy bucket by pulling it up by string after it
has climbed up a ladder that is attached to the platform, which is high
up in the cage. These tricks are very well done. The first, mentioned
above, is easily taught by an amateur in the following manner: We
select at first a bird that is seen often to jump up from the perch to
the top of the cage and come down again to the perch, or fly up in the
air and tumbles there, and we place this bird in a cage in which a string
is tied about 2J or 3 inches high across the perch. Soon the bird begins
to tumble in the air over the string, and so it easily learns the trick ;
and when it has learnt it we raise the string 1 or 2 inches higher, and

<bodyText confidence="0.943014027777778" page_id="32670891"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
so by degrees we teach the bird to tumble in the air about 1 or 2 feet
high. When its education is so far advanced we hang a ring in the cage
instead of the string, so the bird tumbles through the ring in the same
manner as it has done over the string. This bird likes to sleep at
night in a dark place, so we often hang a small gourd in the cage in
which a hole is made for an entrance to the sleeping apartment.
In Japan there are some jugglers who exhibit birds which have
been trained to perform many funny tricks, singly or with companions,
among which the following are generally seen : A bird picks up a toy
straw bag and takes it to a storehouse, and another bird puts it into
the storehouse, or a bird picks up a card on which the Japanese character
is written that the looker-on has asked for, or a bird climbs up a pole
by a ladder and rings the bell which is hung at the top of the pole, etc.
In many cases the Titmice do such tricks very well and easily.
In respect to the Parrot and Parrakeets the Japanese keep them
chiefly in bell-shaped wire cages singly or in pairs and a few attempt
to breed either Parrots or Parrakeets. I have bred Budgerigars,
Cockatiels, Red-ramped Parrakeets, Rosy-faced and Madagascar
Love Birds, and White-fronted Amazons in my outdoor aviaries, and
also the following Parrakeets have been bred and reared by certain
Japanese bird-lovers, namely, the Rosella, Crimson Broadtail, and
Blue Mountain Lorikeet. Beside these birds we have many kinds of
Parrots,. Parrakeets, Cockatoos, Macaws, Lories, and Lorikeets, and
generally they thrive well in outdoor aviaries if they recover from the
effects of importation.
With the exception of the Domestic Pigeons, we have the following
Wild Pigeons and Doves as cage-birds in Japan : The Barbary Dove,
Java Dove, Zebra Dove, Necklaced Dove, Dwarf Turtle-dove,
Australian Crested Pigeon, Cape Dove, Indian Green-winged Dove,
and Nicobar Pigeon. But the Cape Dove and Nicobar Pigeon are
rarer than other Pigeons, as they are not imported in such large
numbers. The Barbary Dove and Java Dove are the commonest ;
they breed and rear their young very freely and easily in a bar-
cage, and I have known instances of their laying their eggs in
a corner of the cage on the floor and hatching their young and rearing
them very successfully. The Zebra Dove, Dwarf Dove, and Neck-

laced Dove are sometimes imported so numerously that they can be
bought at a very low price.
The Japanese bird-lovers are very fond of listening to the cooing
of the Loo-Choo Green Pigeon, which has a very clear purring coo with
many variations, but this bird is delicate and is therefore very scarce,
and commands a high price.
As regards the fancy game birds in Japan the following are found :
The Golden and Silver Pheasants, the Common and Java Peafowls,
Chinese and Formosan Tree-partridges, the Painted and Button Quails,
beside the Japanese Quail, of which I have already written.
We also have the Common Waders and Waterfowls, namely, the
Waterhen, Coot, Grey-headed Gallinule, the Indian Water-rail, Ruddy
Crake, and the Sacred, White-necked, Manchurian, and the Common
Crane, the Mandarin Duck, Teal, Common Wild Ducks, Muscovy
Ducks, the Chinese and White-fronted Goose, and the Whooping and
Black Swan. These birds are kept for the ornamentation of the gardens
and the parks.

( b ) The Soft-food Birds
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.881964055555555" page_id="32670892"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
The Japanese as a rule prefer birds for their song rather than their
coloration, so the art of bird-keeping is chiefly restricted to the keeping
of soft-food birds, though during the last few years the art of bird-
breeding has been advancing rapidly. For feeding purposes the
Japanese use a kind of paste, which is called "Suriye", for all birds,
even for those that live on insects or berries. I have already written
about the "Suriye" in my previous article on " Quail-breeding in
Jajian ", so I will not repeat it here. We can get the materials,
i.e. the mixed powdered food, from the bird fanciers' shops, with the
implements for mixing the soft food, which consist of a bowl grooved
inside like a coarse file and a hard wooden staff by which it is mashed
into a paste in the bowl.
We call the soft food by different names according to the proportion
or quantity of animal food which it contains; for instance, if the food
contains one-tenth part of vegetable food we call it " Japan-ye ", and if
two-tenths part " Nibu-ye ", and if the mixture is half and half it is
called " Dogaishi ".
Most insectivorous birds are kept on " Gofun-ye ", that is in

proportion five-tenths of the quantity of animal food to vegetable
food, and the paste which contains the former, below five-tenths part
of the latter, is called weak paste, and above that it is called strong
paste.
The cage of the soft-food birds is an oblong bar-cage with a
detachable bottom, with a bar-grid attached to the bottom of the bar-
cage, and being detachable. This grid keeps the bird in the cage when
the true floor is removed for cleaning purposes, and it also keeps the
bird clean, as it separates it from the dirty floor. The cage also has
an outer cover, which is made of wood and is large enough to contain
the. cage, the entrance of this cover being made to receive a paper
screen for use when the weather is cold.
As the Japanese paste will not keep, it must be made every day,
and in summer twice a day. By strengthening the quantity of the
animal food and lengthening the time of light by putting the cage near
an artificial light, the Japanese make certain species of birds sing
their song at any time that the owner wishes to hear it.
By this method the Japanese have made Thrushes, Buntings, etc.,
sing in the early autumn, training these birds as decoys to catch the
wild birds as they come back from the north.
The most favourite soft-food bird -of this group in Japan is the
Japanese Bush-warbler. This bird has been kept for its song by the
Japanese for many ages, and even now the song is loved by the Japanese,
and as they do not try to breed this bird in captivity a great number
of the young birds are brought up by the bird fancier and bird-lovers
from the nest by hand every year, and they are very carefully fed.
The bird-protection law of Japan prohibits the catching of certain
birds which are scheduled by the law ; the Bush-warbler is one, so
we must obtain permission before taking the young bird from the nest.
When the fledgling reaches maturity it is trained to imitate the song
of the bird which is the best singer of its own kind by listening to its
song. The Japanese love those birds which sing their songs graduated
three times successively, that is, the first is the highest and the last
is the lowest, and the third one must be sung very clearly and perfectly.
Good singers often cost more than #10, and every year some meetings
are held by the lovers of the Bush-warbler to judge its song. The

Mrs. Burgess -- My Birds
lovers of this bird often keep their birds in a very luxurious cage, as
as I have mentioned in my previous article, " Quail-breeding in
Japan." The Japanese Bush-warbler is often fed in the same manner
as the other insectivorous birds, with a worm which lives in the stem
of the cotton plant or wild vine.
The next to mention is the Japanese Robin, which is a very active
manly bird with a strong loud melodious song, and some bird-lovers
prefer this bird to the Bush-warbler. As this bird is very bold it is
soon tamed, and often we meet with these birds tamed. They sing
their song as soon as they see the owner's hand wave over the top of their
cage. In their wild state they live in the dark silent woods of a
mountain ravine, so we have better results by keeping them covered
uj) than by not using the cover. This bird is rather delicate in
summer.
We have the following species of Robin : the Temmincks' Rohm,
Eastern Robin, Ruby Throat, Siberian Blue Robin, Indian Stone-chat,
Japanese Accentor, Japanese Blue Fly-catcher, and Narcissus Fly-
catcher.
As I have mentioned in the article on Hard-bills in this paper, the
Japanese feed the Bunting on the soft food. Among the Buntings
the following species are commonly seen in captivity : the Japanese
Bunting, the Japanese Yellow Bunting, the Yellow-throated Bunting,
and the Japanese Meadow Bunting. All these Buntings are very good
songsters, especially the Japanese Bunting and the Japanese Yellow
Bunting. The Reed Bunting and the Japanese Reed Bunting are also
appreciated by the Japanese, and the Chestnut Bunting is often
imported from China.

to a large nesting-box right at the top of the aviary, and remain in
this practically all the time. They have always been and are still
very shy, but have grown glorious birds, and I only wish they would
allow us to view them more. I am sure they are a true pair because
I can see the difference in size and in the length of the beak in the
two birds. If they are out they at once begin to call, so this is one's
only chance of seeing them, and if perfectly quiet one may get a good
view; but on the slightest sound there is a rush and both try and run
into the box together, with the result that they get fixed and one has
to pull back. It is as good as a play, this Jack-in-a-box performance.
They are perfectly harmless to other birds, and feed on insect food
and mealworms. They will not peck if you have to handle them.
Their plumage now is getting quite perfect. The prevailing colour is
beautiful metallic blue, glossed with dark green and purple. The
inner web of the first three quills is decorated by a single white spot,
while the next six in order have two white spots. The three first tail-
feathers are similarly adorned and are also marked near the tip. The
eyes are brown, the beak long, fine, and a beautiful red, as are also the
feet. The wings measure 6 inches and the tail 9 inches. They copy
each other in everything, and utter their cry on rising from the ground.
In spite of the shortness of the legs they run over the ground with
tolerable ease. They have a very strong odour such as I have never
yet smelt in any other bird, but one only notices this on actually
handling the birds or approaching them very closely. Can any member
tell me if these birds have been imported before ? Mine are supposed
to be the first importation.
Another rare bird I have is the pink Grey Parrot, which had lived
in Belgium several years before she came to me. She was brought
from the Congo by a traveller, and exhibited at a bird show in
Brussels where she won first prize. She is quite unique so far as I know ;
talks well and is gentle and finger-tame. A large bird, larger than my
old Grey Parrot. The whole of her body except the quills and a few
feathers on the wings, which are normal, is pink, like a Flamingo,
each feather being bright pink with lighter pink edge. The tail is
crimson, the head light pink and white, the eyes and feet dark. She
laid five eggs while with me last year, and became fearfully broody.

In fact, her one object when out is to find a nest, any box is a great
attraction, but so far the Greys I have had with her have all turned
out to be hens, and she will at once attack them. Male Greys seem hard
to get. I don't want her plumage hurt, so that makes me fear a fight.
Then, different again is the large Pesquet's Parrot, but I believe
that Lord Tavistock has written on this wonderful bird. It was found
it could not stand out of doors even in summer, and as my aviaries
are indoors, and heated in winter, it was sent to me. On arrival at
my house it took three days to make up its mind to come out of its box,
which had been placed in an aviary by itself. It had been very
frightened on the journey, and when it is frightened it lifts its voice,
and the more it did this the more the porters looked at it, until on
arrival it was shouting loud and strong, and I may add its voice is like
a donkey's bray ! Now it is pretty good unless the " inner man "
requires attention, and this has to be attended to at once by order of
" The General ", as we call him. He looks rather like a Vulture, and
eats only bread and milk, fruit, and practically the same food as a Lory.
Given a bunch of grapes he holds them in his claws and sucks out all
the juice with his flesh-coloured tongue, which is not brush-tipped as
in the Lories. He is a very heavy bird, scarlet and black, -and is in
perfect plumage, and really a dear old thing. I can rub him, and he
likes lots of petting. He tries hard now to talk, and has a very deep
voice quite unlike that of any other Parrot that I have heard. This
bird, I believe, was the first ever imported, a second Pesquet imported
in 1921 having gone to America ; mine remains the first and only one
in Europe.

their present quarters looking very fit and tight, though evidently
domineered over by a fine red-headed cock ; he afterwards became
the villain of the piece, but I will not anticipate.
It was with mixed feelings that I saw that the black-headed pair
thought of going to nest, popping in and out of the nest-boxes, carrying
bits of dry grass and the cock performing his absurd little " display
Of course, it was delightful to find that I had a breeding pair, but horrid
doubts assailed me ; the summer even of 1921 could not last much
longer--it was the end of September--what if the long foretold wet
weather set in and my poor little hen fell a victim to egg binding ?
More than one friend assured me this would most likely be the case,
but I did long for young Gouldians, and could not find it in my heart
to thwart this attempt. Both birds were in splendid condition and
thoroughly acclimatized, so I resolved to let matters take their course
and hope for the best. The Black-heads seemed to approve of " labour
saving ", for the nesting-box which they finally fixed on already con-
tained a partly constructed nest, and though ample nesting material
was at their disposal they merely added a little dried grass and decided
that nothing more was required. The nest-boxes are in the covered
part of the aviary, so circumstances were favourable for the birds.
All went well; the eggs duly hatched without any catastrophe,
and the young were reared on spray millet and seeding grass. Un-
fortunately I released the red-headed cock just before the young birds
were fledged, and he so harried the poor little parents that they could
not feed their young sufficiently and the hen bird died. The aggressor
was caught up and re-caged before he could do further mischief, and
the remaining three babies were safely reared by their father. They
are still in nestling plumage, so I do not yet know their sex.

to observe a man approach. The man's cap was placed over the bird's
head, and so it was made a prisoner. Mr. St. Quintin was just in time
to save it from the tender mercies of the taxidermist.
Mandarin and Carolina Hybrids. -- I do not believe that a hybrid
between the Mandarin and Carolina Ducks has ever been reared,
although one has known of the two species pairing. Mr. Wormald
writes me that he has a Mandarin Drake voluntarily mated to a Carolina
Duck, but he fears that the eggs will be infertile. He has had eggs from
such a mating before, he says, but they have always been infertile.
I have seen many hybrids of which one parent was a Carolina, and it
seems strange that this duck should not produce hybrids with the
Mandarin, with which it is supposed to be so closely allied. Certainly
the females are much alike in outward appearance, though whether
the two species are really closely related seems doubtful.
Ornamental Waterfowl. -- Mr. Wormald is looking forward to
a successful season with his Ornamental Waterfowl, of which be has
over seventy pairs of the best kinds. There are few forms of aviculture
more fascinating than the keeping and breeding of the smaller ducks,
providing one possesses the necessary facilities. The eggs are generally
collected and hatched under small hens, of which the best kind for the
purpose is a cross between the Silkie and some normally-feathered
type of Bantam such as the Japanese. The rearing of the ducklings
of some of the small Teal requires considerable skill, but if left to the
parent duck the chances are that she will lose most of her ducklings
from the attention of hawks, stoats, weasels, or persecution by other
ducks.
Binged Teal. -- The small and very beautiful Ringed Teal (Nettion
torquata) is one of the rarest and most highly prized of the South
American ducks. There are but few pairs in the country. Mr. Astley
had a lovely pair when I visited Brinsop Court last spring, but I believe
they have not bred. I believe they have been bred at Lilford, and
Mr. Wormald has recently secured some from abroad. He writes :
" So far I have never had any luck with Ringed Teal. In 1914 I had
a pair which laid one egg only, from which a duckling hatched but died
in a week. Last year I had a pair which laid one egg only in a Carolina's
nest. This also hatched but died young, and then a stoat killed the

old pair ! The ducklings are lovely little things, grey and white with
pink legs and feet."
Eclipse Plumage.-- It is a well-known fact that in the ducks
of the Northern Hemisphere the males, after the breeding season,
moult their gaudy feathers and take on a plumage closely resembling
that of the females. In the Southern Hemisphere this rule does not
apply. In many species the sexes are alike, but there are some, such
as the Rosy-bill and the Ringed Teal, in which the sexes are completely
different; but they do not go into " eclipse " plumage like the northern
ducks. The Chestnut-breasted Teal of Southern Australia and Tasmania
is perhaps an exception, but the eclipse in this species is not complete
and seems to vary in individuals, some drakes taking on a partial
eclipse plumage in the autumn, while others do not change at all at
that season.

DR. GOSSE'S PROPOSAL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968064666666667" page_id="32670899"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --The suggestion made by Dr. Gosse amounts to this : The
Avicultural Society, strictly founded for the study of birds, is to be
wound up and a new Society to include the study of all branches of
zoology is to replace it. If we include fur as well as feather in our
Magazine, there is no reason for excluding scale and shell: reptiles
appeal to me more strongly than mammals and arthropods have had
a great fascination for me from my earliest youth ; in fact, I began to
take pleasure in the study of them when only 7 years old. Now,
however, I could not recommend the study of zoology in its many
branches ; and, if the scope of our Society were to be thus extended,
I should reluctantly feel bound to resign my membership.
As one of the original members and founders of the Avicultural
Society, I should be sorry to see its absorption into a Zoological Society ;
but possibly it has done all and more than all that it was expected to
do towards the advancement of science, and whatever is decided upon
we may congratulate ourselves upon the fact that up to the present
it has not been useless.

OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS OF PREY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99549662962963" page_id="32670900"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- In case any member has spare time for the above, might I
suggest they carry out a series of observations either on the immature
King Vulture (Gypagos pajxi), of Brazil, which was in the Gardens last
summer or on the Vociferous Sea Eagle (Haliaetus vocifer ), of
Madagascar, or on both of these ?
If observations were made and written down at intervals of every
two months, noting whether there was any change of colour in feathers,
beak, iris, or feet, or whether these parts were the same as two months
before, they ought to be of interest to publish in the future as a record.
Personally, I have no tune for such at present, and should like to suggest
it for some one who has.
Changes of colour in feathers of birds are always of interest to observe
or read about, as also those in fur of mammals. If the latter get included
within the scope of the Magazine, we might get some interesting
remarks on four-footed creatures ; and it seems to me there would be
no great difficulty in a title for the including of mammals.
Would not " The Bird and Mammal Magazine " be a suitable one 1
" Bird " coming first in the name (different to the natural position in
the animal kingdom) would show that the mazazine was mostly devoted
to birds, and that mammals only were secondary.
But to return to the title of these remarks, I may say that if it be
of use to another observer (as suggested), the Vulture was still darkish
brown in July, 1921 -- no signs of the gaudy (for a Vulture) colorations
of the adults.

observed it. --Eds.]

ERLANGER'S FALCON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98405325" page_id="32670900"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- Mr. F. D. Welch, in his article on the above species of Falcon,
suggests that it and other Falcons kill their prey by the grip of its feet
alone ? The methods which all the true Falcons employ are well known
to all practical falconers ; two methods are employed about equally,

<bodyText confidence="0.987779888888889" page_id="32670901"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
but some individuals seem inclined to adopt one method almost to the
exclusion of the other. The first method, and perhaps the most striking,
is when the Falcon " stoops " from a great height at its prey (" quarry "
is the technical term), which is doing its best to escape by flight far
below it, and cuts its victim over with such force that it falls dead or
very severely cripjDled to the ground. (I have seen a grouse bound
6 feet into the air from the force of the impact when struck.) The
Falcon " draws up " and comes down on her victim, who, if alive, is
adroitly killed at once by a severe bite at the base of the skull, crushing
the vertebrae. If the prey is of a kind that is likely to defend itself,
such as a Crow, or Rook, or Gull, the Falcon muzzles it first with one
foot, and then kills it.
The other method is as follows. The " stoop " is, of course, the same,
but the Falcon, instead of cracking her " quarry " over, comes down
slightly behind it, and with the immense impetus gained by the stoop
rushes through the air immediately overtaking almost any bird, who
is seized in the feet (this is called " trussing ") and carried on a short
or longer distance, according to either the weight of the bird or the
will of the Falcon. On these occasions the quarry, of course, is always
alive, but is so quickly killed by the Falcon on landing that it is always
extremely difficult to get up in time to save the life of any bird. The
Falcon in question is one of the Lanner Falcons, Falco biarmicus
elangeri ; it inhabits North Africa, and is, or, rather, was, much used
by the Arabs in falconing. We have never thought much of the
Lanners ; this country does not really suit them, and the Peregrine
is all that can be desired.
The true Eagles, Aquila, kill their prey much as the Falcons do, but
as the great majority of their prey are mammals and caught on the
ground, they are killed by the immensely powerful grip of the feet and
talons.
The Short-winged Hawks, such as the Goshawk, Astur, and Sparrow
Hawk, Acciqnter, which catch their prey by means of a short and very
rapid chase through the air, kill their prey by crushing with their feet,
and so far as one can make out, do not seem aware of the " seat of life '
like the Falcons are ; but anyone who has carried a female Goshawk in
" yarak " (the technical term for " flying order ") on his glove can well

COMPARING REMARKS ON CAPTIVE AND WILD BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982857692307692" page_id="32670902"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
Sirs,--S ome people are inclined to argue that observations made
on foreign birds " do not show the true character of the species ".
It seemed to me, therefore, advisable to point out that the remarks
about Forster's Milvago or Carrion Hawk of the Falkland Islands,
printed in the Avicultural Magazine, 1920, pp. 41-3, were (so far as
character was concerned) supported by observations of two people in
the birds' native lands. In my remarks on Ihgcter australis it was
evident that the birds were of fearless and daring character as shown
by the words " A striking feature of these Milvagoes during their
earlier years--especially from about 1900 to 1908 -- was their aggressive
temper towards other birds ", and their hostility to two Eagles ending
with "so that Forster's Milvago is not deficient in courage". Their
noisy behaviour was shown by words " shrieking wildly and

vociferously " ; and their heavy flight as compared \0x25A0with the allied
Caracaras was shown in the last lines.
Let us turn to observations of two people at very different periods
and see whether they support the above conclusions of mine. I think
they do. Darwin ( Royal Natural History) wrote : " They live on the
flesh, of dead animals and marine productions, and on the Ramirex
rocks their whole sustenance must depend on the sea. They are
extraordinarily tame and fearless " (italics mine--supports their character
as formed by me, F.D.W.) " and haunt the neighbourhood of houses
for offal " (evidently with little fear of man, here agreeing again with
the Zoological Gardens' birds which showed no fear at all.--F.D.W.).
They are also stated to be " quarrelsome and very passionate, tearing
up the grass with their bills from rage " (agrees with quarrelsome
nature of two in Gardens versus Tawny Eagle and Crowned Hawk,
Eagle referred to by me.--F.D.W.). " They are noisy uttering several
harsh cries " (agrees with shrieking wildly, etc.--F.D.W.). " They
build on rocky cliffs of the seacoast, but only on the small adjoining
islets, not on the two main islands ; this is a singular precaution in so
tame and fearless a bird." And as supporting my remarks about flight
he says " Their flight is heavy and clumsy ".
Other remarks as to character, although not directly concerned
with the two birds formerly in the Gardens, are of interest to add ; and
Darwin states : " If a hunting party kills an animal a number soon
collect, standing on the ground on all sides. They readily attack
wounded birds ; a Cormorant in this state having been taken to the
shore was immediately seized on by several, and its death hastened by
their blows." Occasionally these birds wait at the mouth of a hole
made by a rodent-mammal and seize it when it comes out.
Leaving Darwin's remarks, and coming to present times, there is a
letter in the Field, p. 506, 15th October, 1921, about the birds of Isla
Hermite, near Cape Horn. The writer is referring to Penguins
(although no species is given, they seem to me to be the Rock Hopper,
Eudyptes chrysocome, with crest mostly of black, and yellow along its
crest's sides.--F.D.W.), and states that during their moult of three
weeks when they huddle away in rocky crevices, many die during the
period, " some from exhaustion, but others fall an easy prey to the

mine). This again agrees with the observations in Zoological Gardens.

SUGGESTIONS ON BREEDING SHRIKES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989968115384615" page_id="32670904"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --In the Avicultural Magazine, 1921, it is stated on p. 168 that,
among the species which migrate to Britain, the only one which has
bred in captivity is the Red-backed Shrike ( Lavius collurio) ; and in
this connexion it may be worth mentioning a scene with two wild
birds.
When in Herts in 1892, I found a nest and although there were no
eggs then in it and no birds were visible at the time, it was evidently
a. Shrike's, because of the numbers of insects stuck on to thorns of the
hedge for several feet on both sides of the nest (which was a very ragged,
untidy structure of coarse grass, twigs, a few rags interwoven in these
swaying in the breeze !). On the next visit one of the birds saw me
handle the two eggs then in the nest and made a flying attack at me,
shrieking wildly and excitedly, although I had replaced the eggs,
and made such a noise that its mate soon arrived on the scene and
joined in the attack.
Judging from this experience, it would seem absolutely necessary
that Shrikes should be in an aviary away from any source of irritation
from outside such as noisy children, barking dogs, squalling cats,
and suchlike if it is hoped to get them to breed successfully in captivity
and ought also to have an aviary to themselves, and without any birds
near which are liable to quarrel.
Also the experience with wild Shrikes suggests that any attempt " to
have a peep " into the nest " to see what nest and eggs were like " would
have equally bad results as in the first nest made by the Saltator
Tanagers which deserted ( Avicultural Magazine, 1921, p. 161).

{Concluded from p. 36.)
The Skylark is also a favourite bird in Japan. It is fed on paste
as well as on seed, and it is kept either in a small square cage just like
that of the Quail, or a tall round cage; in either case a small round table
or T-shaped perch is erected in the centre of the cage on which the bird
perches to sing its lovely song.
Though it is not numerous, we have also the Tien-tsin Lark, which is
a large bird, and it has a bill much like that of a Finch. Its colour is
light brown, with white secondaries and under parts. It is an
excellent mocker. The Brown-eared Bulbul also imitates the song of
other birds, and its own song is also not bad, but as the notes are too
noisy and too rough, it is rarely kept in a cage except for decoying
purposes. The Red-eared Bulbul is imported every year, but not in
great numbers, and it is often kept by the Japanese bird-lovers in cages
or aviaries, but I have not yet heard that it has bred in Japan. The bird
is very hardy, and can stand the cold winter nights in an outdoor
aviary.
The Black Bulbul from Formosa is rarely found in the shops of the
bird fanciers. It is also a hardy bird. Another common soft-bill is the
White-eye. This bird is very hardy and bold, so it is found in the
luxurious cage of the millionaire's house, and also in the small bamboo
cage of the poor peasant's hut, and in either situation it sings its high,

beautiful song at its best. This bird rears its brood in the late spring,
and passes the summer in the cool mountain forest, and comes down
to the plain in autumn in great numbers, uttering lovely notes as it
searches for its food among the bushes and woods. As a cage-bird it
lives on the common paste, and is quite healthy and very active, always
jumping from branch to branch or from the branches to the bars at
the side of the cage, then to the top, and then to the branch again,
and all the time it utters its cry " tsi-tsi The bird-lovers select
birds which always repeat their note twice, i.e. " tsi-tsi ", because
such birds become good singers in the spring. The meeting of the lovers
of this bird is often held not in a house but in a garden or park, where
the cages are hung on the branches of trees, and there the judges can
hear the lovely song of the birds to advantage while the spectators
sit quietly on a bench and drink tea, because the White-eye endeavours
to sing better when it hears the song of other birds. For this bird a
high price is asked if it is a good singer, though it is not so high as that
asked for the Japanese Bush Warbler.
This bird is fed simply on boiled sweet potatoes, or persimons when
this fruit is in season. If some members of the White-eye are kept in
one cage or aviary they live quite peacefully. When they roost they
always perch very close together, so the Japanese often say if men sit
close together they sit like the " White-eye The Temminck's Red-
breast is a very beautiful bird which has light-red upper parts, jet black
face, throat, and breast, and pure white belly. It is a very hardy and
active bird, and thrives well in a cage. It was bred by many bird-
lovers in aviaries about 100 years ago. The birds which appeared
at the bird fanciers' shops of that time were, it is said, nearly all bred
in aviaries. This bird's song is inferior to that of the Japanese Robin.
It is now brought from the Loo-Choo Islands. The Eastern Robin is
a sober-coloured bird, whose upper parts are olive-brown and the lower
parts Avhite, and the throat, breast, and sides have olive-brown
splashings. This bird is a good singer, and is very much loved by the
Japanese bird-lovers, but it is rather rare.
The Ruby-throat is a little larger than the Japanese Robin, and has
a beautiful crimson throat, but its song is not so good as that of the
Robin. This is also a rare bird and delicate.

The Siberian Blue Robin is of a cobalt-blue, with black eyebrows
and pure white breast and abdomen. This bird is delicate when first
caught, but when it is accustomed to a life of captivity it becomes
hardy. When it is caught it is fed on a strong paste (about 1-8 fun Ye--
see the paragraph on food), but when it is tamed it is fed on weaker
food (i.e. 3-5 fun Ye). It is beneficial to this bird to give it one or two
small earthworms frequently. The Indian Stonechat can't be
differentiated from the European species. The Fantailed Warbler
and Grasshopper Warbler have been very much admired by the
Japanese aviculturists from olden times. As they are very delicate
birds it becomes the bird-lovers' pride to keep them in good health.
They are brown, soberly coloured birds, but the Grasshopper Warblers
have a good song.
The Japanese also esteem the Golden-crested Wren, the Japanese
Longtailed Tit, the Japanese Wren. These birds are very delicate,
and it is difficult to keep them many years. They must be kept in a
cool place during the summer. They are pretty and active, and the
Wren has also a very good strong song. The Japanese Accentor is
also a favourite bird in Japan. Its head is of a reddish-brown colour,
the back is brown, with dark spots and the under parts are grey, with
a little tint of brown. As its song resembles that of the Wren, it is also
called " Great Wren " by the Japanese. It sings very well in the
spring, and when it is domesticated it becomes a very hardy bird.
We have about eight species of the Wagtail in Japan, but we have
the three following species as cage-birds, namely, the Grey Wagtail,
the Kamtschatkau, and Japanese Wagtail, but the first two species are
the commonest. They sing a pretty song from the latter part of spring
to summer.
The Japanese Water Pipit and the Eastern Tree Pipit are also
often kept in a cage, and they are also good singers. These Wagtails
and Pipits often eat seed better than paste, when they are kept in
an aviary with the hard billed species.
The Waxwing is very rarely kept in Japan, as it is a very delicate
bird, though it is easily trained to take food in captivity. Contrary to
the other delicate birds, the Waxwing must not be given paste the
strength of which is more than 3 fun Ye, i.e. the quantity of the animal

food in tlie paste is t 3 q parts of the vegetable food, as this bird is liable
to fatten easily. The Japanese Wax-wing is far more common than
the Bohemian Wax-wing in Japan.
The Japanese keep Thrushes chiefly for decoy purposes, but the
Grey Blackbird is kept for its beautiful song. This Blackbird has white
on its abdomen ; the bill and legs are yellow. If it is reared from a
fledgeling it becomes so tame as to sing its song while it perches on the
owner's hand. It is very fond of bathing. The Solitary Thrush is also
kept in a cage though it is scarce ; this is a very beautiful bird. Its
upper parts are blue, and the under parts are chestnut; it also has a
very good song.
We find also the White's Thrush in bird fancier's shops sometimes,
but this bird has no good song, and is also subjected to insect trouble,
so we must allow it to bathe constantly. The Spectacled Thrash, the
Chinese Jay-thrush, the Collared Jay-thrush, and the White-crested
Jay-thrush are amongst the commonest foreign birds imported into
Japan.
Another common foreign bird is the Pekin Nightingale, which is a
very pretty little bird, and has a good song. It is a very hardy bird,
and thrives well in the winter without any heat, and if we get a true
pair they breed well in an aviary. These birds are very tame and active,
and they often take seed as well as the paste. Sometimes the Quail
bird is imported, but in small numbers.
The Grey Starling is often kept in a cage. This bird becomes very
tame if taken as a fledgeling from the nest, and it will learn easily to
mimic the song of other birds and the mewing of the cat, but it is too
common in Japan to be popular as a cage-bird. Foreign Starlings, such
as the Malabar Mynah, the Pagoda Starling, the Rose-coloured Starling,
the Indian Mynah, and the Crested Mynah are also imported into
Japan. All these foreign Starlings live well in an outdoor aviary,
through the year.
The Hill Mynah is another popular bird in Japan. This bird is
kept by many Japanese for its excellent talents of mimicry. In Japan
there is no bird which has more excellent talent for mocking than this
bird, as the Grey Parrot which is imported also in large numbers is
a poorer mocker than the Hill Mynah, but the very small Green Parrots

sometimes surpass the Hill Mynah. The price of the Mynah is often
over #10, if it mimics the Japanese language.
Of the Crow tribe, we have a very small number as cage-birds.
The commonest of these is the Japanese Jay, and it is very hardy, and
sometimes we find an excellent mocker amongst them. The Lidith
Jay was formerly brought from the Loo-Choo (Amami Oshima) in
numbers, but now it has become very scarce. It mimics better than the
Japanese Jay, but it is quite similar to it in its hardiness. The Piet
is also sometimes imported in small numbers.
Of the Woodpeckers, the commonest Japanese species are the
Japanese Pied Woodpecker, the Japanese Green Woodpecker, the
Japanese Pigmy Woodpecker, and the Wryneck, but these are rarely
kept in cages. They are generally very hardy.
The little Cocker and the common Cuckoos are kept by some of the
most successful aviculturists, especially those of western Japan.
\0x2666 The small Waders, that is to say the Rails, the Snipe, and the
Plovers are often fed with paste food by the Japanese.

During the summer of 1921 I took a trip round the United States of
North America, returning through Southern Canada. The object of my
trip was to visit the forests of North America, which the lumbermen
are cutting down in a most alarming way, but I have not forgotten the
birds for all that, and it may interest the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine to hear which kinds of birds I met travelling over that
enormous extent of country.
I took ship in Rotterham on the 20th May, I believe, arriving in
New York ten days later. New York is not a birdy place, and even the
European Sparrows are scarce birds there, chiefly, I suppose, on account
of the horse traffic having given way to the automobiles. It was terribly
hot in New York on my arrival there, and hoping to get some fresh air
I went to Central Park a couple of clays after my arrival. I did not find
fresh air in Central Park, just the reverse, as the numberless automobiles
made it even more dusty than the streets, and a great part of the soil

being very rocky the trees looked starved and some of them even
dying. However, on the parched lawns I found some birds which
were new to me in a wild state, and which made me forget the heat
and the dust. The most conspicuous amongst them were numerous
Purple Graekles (Quiscalus quiscala ), who went about mostly in pairs, the
male with beautiful purple glossy plumage and with an enormously long
boat tail. Besides these Graekles, the migratory Thrush or " Robin ",
as the Americans call him (Turdus migratorius), was running about
everywhere, being quite tame, as our Blackbirds or Song Thrushes are
in Europe. Broadpark was the next place I went to, to see wild birds
after the zoological collection had been examined, and the harvest was
a good deal better than it was in Central Park.
Broadpark is situated in the outskirts of New York, and is partly
converted into a zoological park and partly into a botanical garden,
of which, again, a part is the unaltered natural forest. Accordingly
the wild birds are more numerous and much more at home there than
in the crowded artificial Central Park. In Broadpark the most common
and most conspicuous bird is, again, the Migratory Thrush, which is
a summer visitor only--and Graekles, with their long boat-shaped
tails are also very numerous on the grass. In more secluded woods
I found the pretty Cat-bird (Galeoscoptes carolinensis) singing its song
on a branch 8 or 20 feet from the ground. The song, although pretty,
seemed to me to be of not much melody. Besides, some rufous
Thrushes, probably Wilson's, were seen running on the ground amongst
the bushes.
In the Zoological Park a Baltimore Oriole was singing lustily
in some shrubs, and I was told it nested there, and Song
Sparrows were quite abundant, running on the ground much
in the same Avay as our Hedge Sparrows ( Accentor) do. On one
occasion I saw a beautiful male American Redstart (Setojrfiaga
ruticilla), which, except that it has red in its tail does not remind one
of a European Redstart at all; and I also saw a big Kingfisher (Ceryle
torquata ) flying over me. Besides the birds, grey squirrels were
numerous, and so tame as to feed from the hand of the children. Little
Chipmunks {Tamins striatus) were running on the ground in the wooded
parts, and seemed to make their homes in the hollow tree-roots.

From New York I went south to Washington, a journey of about
six hours by express train, mostly over sandy country overgrown with
weedy pine-trees. Passing near a small swamp not far from New York,
I saw some so-called Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelceus phceniceus)
sitting in the reeds. Washington, although hot, was quite a relief
after the stuffy and dusty atmosphere of New York, and the streets
being planted with rows of trees looked quite cheerful after the barren
New York skyscrapers. In Washington there is a pretty park round
the Capitol, and there, running over the grass like the green Wood-
pecker does in Europe, I found several examples of the Golden-winged
Woodpecker ( Colaptes auratus), which in Europe I had often kept in
my aviaries. Besides this Golden-winged, I saw several other Wood-
peckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus) that looked like gentlemen in
black with white coat-tails and scarlet heads. They seemed to have
nests in the hollow trees, and took not the slightest notice of passers-by.
In the Zoological Gardens, which are situated in very fine, hilly country,
in what has been, I was told, a private country seat in the immediate
neighbourhood of the town, I was greeted by the sight of a pair of
Red Cardinals flying about. These birds, although protected, were
not numerous, as Dr. Hollister told me. As I have mentioned the
name of Dr. Hollister, the director of the zoological collection, I must
also mention the gems of his bird collection, namely, three splendid
living examples of the nearly extinct Californian Condor. For those
who don&apos;t know him, I might mention that this Condor is smaller
than the Condor of the Andes of South America, that it has about the
same coloration, but that the male has no fleshy crest and that the
naked head is coloured red and yellow. Dr. Hollister told me that they
had nested, but that unfortunately nothing had come of it.
From Washington I took the train to go south to St. Augustine in
Florida, a journey which takes two days and a night. A little south
of the town of Washington there was a colony of Sandmartins in
exactly the same site as where we find them in Europe, but, on the
whole, birds were exceedingly scarce. As we were nearing Florida on
the second day, Ave passed an occasional cypress swamp, in which the
trees, overgrown as they Avere by long clusters of tillandsia and with
SAvollen bases, had a most weird aspect. On, one occasion I saw a

small flight of rvhite birds flying away from us, and which looked like
White Ibises, but they were too far to be sure of it. In the fields the
train frightened away flocks of sharp-tailed little Doves, probably
Zenaidura macrura. In Jacksonville I had to change and the new
train brought me to St. Augustine, where I arrived about S o'clock
at night.
St. Augustine is situated, as everybody knows, on the Atlantic with
Anastasia Island, with which it is connected with a bridge, opposite.
The first bird I saw the next morning was a Mocking Thrush ( Mimus
poli/glottus), which was running about the garden, looking extremely
long and thin, and moving its long tail continually in all possible
directions, and I afterwards found out that this Thrush takes the place
of the Migratory Thrush in the Southern States. It is seen everywhere
in the gardens of the towns and in the woods, and it is a very active
and rather quarrelsome bird that is not used to hiding himself. The
song of these birds resemble almost exactly the song of the European
Song Thrush, but is not nearly so strong nor so melodious. In fact,
I was very much disappointed when I heard the first bird sing, and I
think that it cannot stand in the shade of its European cousin. The
next bird I saw was a female Nonpareil Finch, which was feeding on
seeds of rough weeds that grew near the hotel. In a bit of wood con-
sisting of glorious old magnolia-trees ( Magnolia grandiflora), evergreen
oaks and junipers, all of them overgrown by tillandsia and long,
creeping vines, I saw a splendid pair of Red Cardinals that were
mobbing a pair of Blue Florida Jays, so that they probably had a brood
not far off. I also heard the notes of a family of Bobvdiites ( Colinus
virginianus), which, however, kept so well-hidden in the thick under-
wood that I could not see them. Over the bog a little white Black-
capped Tern, probably Sterna antillarwn, was fishing with great
diligence.
If one stood on the bridge that connected St. Augustine with
Anastasia Island when the tide was low, there was a good occasion to
observe the little Herons that were looking for food on tlxe mud-flats.
Some of these little Herons were pure white, some were grey with rufous
plumes on their backs and white plumes on the heads, and some were
grey and white ; they all were extremely beautiful. In a dead tree

not far from the sea were perched some Turkey Vultures (Cathartes
aura), old friends which I had met in Chile as far south as the Straits
of Magellan.
From St. Augustine I went by auto to Palatka, on the St. John River.
The owner of the hotel at St. Augustine had told me that I was sure to
admire very much the country I was to pass through -- " All potato
fields, very beautiful ! " Fortunately it was not " all potato fields ",
aud we passed through some beautiful cypress swamps, a kind of
wooden viaduct having been made over the water. A great part of
the country, however, consisted of pine woods, or more exactly
of what had been pine woods, nearly all the trees having been cut down,
as is the case nearly everywhere in Florida.

We are only a few miles from the hub of the world, and yet I have
seen about forty species of birds in the old garden. It would be
interesting to keep for a year a diary of notes on birds in such a garden,
though it would be melancholy to find, as building creeps on, their
numbers diminish. Our birds consist of the following : --
A colony of Rooks, once very large, now decreased in size, nests in
the old beeches overlooking the.garden. When busy with nest-building
the birds come on to the lawn quite close up to the house for food. This
spring a Rook with half-white wings has appeared, and we are curious
to see if he will be tolerated among his swarthy brethren. As we
never saw r him before, it would seem as if he were a newcomer, in which
case, however, his sojourn is likely to be of brief duration, as no
foreigners are allowed in the sacred precincts of a rookery. One
luckless " Outlander " who once ventured among them, and succeeded in
building a nest -- but very much out in the cold and far from the others--
was set upon by the colony and slain, his nest torn to bits, and his carcase
hung from the boughs of the tree he had dared to call his home ! -Jack-

Rooks, and sometimes I hear the voice of a Crow among them. The
Wood Pigeons are allowed to build near the colony. One very curious
point I have noticed with the Rooks. They evidently have a king or
leader of some sort, for year by year when spring arrives, one Rook
takes his seat outside the colony on a high branch and calls : " Wee-oo !
Wee-oo ! " Whereupon all the others answer " Caw ! " and begin to
fly about. It is obviously a word of command, and when the young are
fledged, " Wee-oo ! " sounds all day long, as the lessons in flying begin,
and the parent birds escort the young ones on their first flight, a little
further every day, till at length they can accompany their parents to
the fields to get worms and grubs. There used to be many wild Turtle
Doves in the garden, having probably come from the Epsom Downs,
where after the races whole flocks appear. Starlings abound, of course,
and the dreadful Sparrow, whose business consists in depriving other
birds of their food, and even life. Blackbirds used to be numerous ;
now only a pair or two build in the garden, generally on a south wall
close to a garden-door in an old creeper. Years ago a hen Blackbird
with only one leg spent several winters here. Thrushes are fairly
numerous. Nightingales used to nest in the old hawthorn hedge
round a pond in the field beyond the garden, but now the traffic on
the road has scared them all away. The Wryneck calls occasionally,
but used to haunt the orchard, where there are old fruit-trees to nest
in. The Cuckoo formerly frequented our garden so that he was a
positive nuisance. After more or less of absence during the war years,
he has now come again. Missel Thrushes fly about in early autumn,
but do not stay to nest in spring. The Great Tit never leaves us. Year
after year his little monotonous note sounds : " Weetle ! Weetle !
Weetle ! " usually repeated three or five times in succession, while after
the breeding season he calls " ping ! ping " like the ringing of a fairy
bell. He is very easily tamed by maize or ground-nuts and will come
indoors. The Blue Tit is also always in evidence, and the Cole Tit,
and the Blackcap. The Greenfinches and Chaffinches consort with the
Sparrows, and by driving the latter away I frighten the former. Having
an orchard here, Nuthatches used to be often seen, but fewer now.
The Spotted Flycatcher built every year on a low branch of an old
cedar, but I cannot find his nest now. Many years ago a very fine

Green Woodpecker appeared on a juniper-stem close to the house, but
the Sparrows were after him at once, and away he flew, never to return.
These are usually very shy birds, but on Headington Hill last summer
I saw a splendid Great Green Woodpecker sitting on a low turf bank
sloping up from the lawn to a terrace in front of the house, and busily
hunting for worms. Though several people went to an upper window
to look at him he made no attempt to fly away, and even glanced up at
us, and then went on digging. He stayed there about half an hour,
then leisurely flew across the lawn to some large trees, and the following
day he came again, and so on for several days. I have never known
a Woodpecker quite so tame, though in a garden at Liss I have watched
one fairly close to the house on a bank digging for large worms.
Bullfinches used to come into the garden, but they are shy birds,
loving quiet, and I seldom, if ever, hear their plaintive little whistle
now. The Chiff-chaff is often about, and the little brown Tree-creeper
and the Wren. The Pied Wagtail nests here, and the White Wagtail
built a charming little nest in some ivy over a fence in the orchard, and
brought out four or five young ones, which used to range themselves
in a row beside a high box edging in the kitchen garden, while the
mother-bird fetched them food, distributing the dainties she had in her
bill, worms, grubs, and insects, to each in turn, and once when there
was not enough to "go round " she started, on her return with fresh food,
with the one she had had to leave out, and who clamoured for his share.
There is an old superstition that if Wagtails come to the windows or
doors or peck at windows, something untoward will happen. Only once
has a Pied Wagtail flown up and pecked at the windows. They are
usually shy of coming near our house. Swifts often pass over, shrieking,
on a summer's evening, and a Hawk has been seen hovering over the
garden. Plovers have been on the lawn, too, in severe winter weather,
and Gulls and Wild Duck have been frequently seen high in the air,
passing over. A Moorhen came to the pond in our field years
ago, and built every year on a pile of sticks and rubbish
by a little backwater, and her tameness was remarkable. She
brought out several broods. Wild Owls, the Tawny and the
Barn Owl were very numerous in our garden, and I have heard
the Little Owl whistling. That was when we had pet Owls

in an enclosure under yews and an old walnut-tree. They called
the others, and there were evidently Owl-parties at night to judge by the
hooting and screeching and whistling that went on. I must close the
list of our birds by a mention of the little Hedge-sparrow, who comes
always in the wake of the other Sparrows, not with them, and the
contrast he forms to them is striking, the little refined, shy bird with
his delicate beak and pretty legs and jerking movements intent on
picking up the remains of the feast gobbled up by the greedy House-
sparrows with their strong beaks and assertive manners, as they pounce
on the best morsels and afterwards on each other in ferocious combat
and jealousy. The bonne bouche comes last, in the shape of the never-
failing Redbreast, most fascinating winter songster and friend of man,
so easily tamed ! " and such a ferocious villain ! " 1 hear someone
say apropos of the accusation that young Robins tear out their parents'
tongues. But in spite of all, I for one cannot give him up.
Some years ago a pair of Swallows came and built under a roof
adjoining our house, below one of the rafters. Swallows had often
visited the spot, but after flying in and out had always gone away
again. Now we hoped they had come to stay. When the wonderful
little nest was half-made 1 heard from a room, the window of which
looked out upon the roof, the cries of a bird in distress. So loud and
continuous were they that I hastened out to see what was the matter.
As soon as I appeared the male Swallow flew up to me and circled
round me several times, screaming evidently in great grief. There,
under the half-finished nest, stabbed all over by cruel beaks, lay his
little mate, dead, while a concourse of House-sparrows sat on an ilex-
tree near chattering. There was no doubt who were the culprits, for
I had repeatedly seen them chasing the Swallows, and some time
previously the wretched " avian rats " had effectually routed a colony
of Swallows from an ancient archway below part of the house, and had
torn their nests to pieces. Alas ! no Swallow lias since come to stay
with us again. The Swallows that used, in years gone by, to build
and rear their young under the same arch, came year after year, at the
same time, before the Sparrows were so numerous, and the young
birds used to sit in a row on the lattice window that opened outward
over the arch, where the parent birds&apos; fed them, quite fearless of the

close proximity of a sink with hot and cold water-taps just under
the window, and the presence there of human beings at all hours of the
day. The young Swallows learnt to fly by means of the lattice window,
\0x25A0whence they took their first flight up to the expanse of outer air at the
bidding of the parent birds, who taught them their first lesson in
aviation.

About three weeks ago I received some Golden Plover from the
Continent, one of which showed a sprinkling of black feathers on belly
and chin. This bird was lamentably thin and weak, so I separated him
and one other very thin bird from the rest, and put them in a small
very sheltered aviary, where I could feed them up. I examined the
bird assuming summer plumage very carefully, but only found one new
feather growing ; this was on his chin. I caught the bird up every three
days, and although he became blacker and blacker I could not find a
single other young feather, neither could I find a cast feather in the
aviary, which is practically sheltered from every wind and has zinc
up the sides 2 ft. 6 in. high, besides a covered shelter, so that I do not
think any feathers can have blown away. I did find a lot of half-
changed black and white feathers on the bird, which were obviously
old winter feathers. I wrote to Mr. J. G. Millais about this bird, and he
answered : " Yes, I think Golden Plover get black partly (possibly
principally) by colour change and partly by new full summer feathers
coming in--keep examining his plumage. Some of these half-changed
black and white feathers (which are old winter ones) drop in April and
are replaced by full blacks." This statement I find to be absolutely
correct. On catching the bird up on 9th April (by then in almost entirely
full summer plumage) I did find several new feathers just through and
quite black, hut none of these feathers showed at all until the bird, was
almost entirely blach on cheeks, chin, throat, breast, and belly. I am well
aware that zoologists deny the possibility of colour-change in old
feathers, and I make no pretence at being scientific, but I have seen quite
enough feathers in Ducks, principally in Wigeon and Garganey Teal,

change colour to .satisfy me that not only is it possible but frequently
occurs. To revert to the Golden Plover ; the bird was covered with
new brilliant black and gold feathers on the back and scapulars, and
I believe that all waders get their breeding plumage partly by moult
aud partly by colour changes. I know that a Snipe I once kejit for
21 years did so.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MAGAZINE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999178" page_id="32670922"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
Sirs,--A s you hope members will freely express their views, those
of a recently elected member are as follows.
Firstly, a two-monthly magazine of the present size is preferable to
a monthly one in the present shortage of copy referred to on p. 27.
At the same time, I cannot agree (even though having been primarily a
mammal worker) with Dr. Philip Gosse's remarks on p. 30 about the
very subject of birds being in grave danger of being over-written,
except so far as books on British birds are written with the view of
encouraging nature study. A " fresh crop " of such handbooks--
more or less copies from previous writers -- appears to be on the way to
" grow " each spring almost as regularly as grass grow r s to hay crop !
Such books are overdone, and too many. But as to foreign birds,
it seems to me more information would at times be useful in the
Magazine, and this leads me to the next section.
Secondly, when a writer is referring to a bird which is not a very
common one, it would be as well if they introduced something about
its geographical range when wild. Some people would say : " Oh,
you can find that in a book of reference on Birds of Asia " (or other
continent, as the case may be). I agree that you can. But such
necessitates additional books and additional " hunting up ", with the
possibility of books referred to giving scanty information after a lengthy
search ; and many people, with their daily business to attend to, have no
spare time for such. The more complete an article, the better it is in
my humble opinion. Many people are naturalists primarily and in later
years aviculturists or keep mammals ; and such are more likely to be
interested in a journal if something of the range of the species or genus

is included in an article -- assuming, of course, that such range is known
to the writer. For instance, how many members who have not
specialized in the Parrot tribe (I have not myself) have any accurate
idea as to where an uncommon Lory or a Lorikeet comes from when the
bare name alone is mentioned ? What proportion knows -- 5 per cent,
or 10, or 40, or 70 ? To be candid, I know I don't (without hunting
out the subject), except the part of the continent in a general way
where the genus is most represented.
As an interchange of views by members is more likely to be profitable
if not overdosed with too many sections for discussion, it seems
advisable to stop at the present with the above two.
Frederick D. Welch.
Sirs,-- Re Dr. Philip Gosse's proposal for articles on other pets
besides birds. I think it would be delightful, and hope it may be carried
into effect.

THE CLUTCH OF BIRDS OF PREY

<bodyText confidence="0.969689" page_id="32670923"  page_num="61" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- Referring to the question raised by Mr. Welch regarding
the clutch of raptorial birds, perhaps the following experience, showing
that the powerful toe-grip is not restricted in that order to Eagles,
Falcons, and Hawks, may be of interest. Some years ago in the
Gardens I had occasion to handle one of the Egyptian Vultures. With
a swift grab at my hand, the bird got hold of the free part of my
thumb. Fortunately his toes went round it, without the claws
penetrating ; but I shall not easily forget the severity of the piuch.
Getting a keeper to hold the bird I tried with my free hand to extend
the toes and release my thumb ; but quite without avail. Another
keeper had to be summoned to my rescue. By using both his hands
he was able to set me free, congratulating myself that the Vulture
had not gripped the palm of mv hand ! It is interesting that a Vulture
which does not use its feet for killing prey, but for holding its food
to the ground while pecking it, should have, I should judge, almost as
powerful a clutch as a small Eagle.

BRITISH BIRDS AND THE GREY SQUIRREL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997273347826087" page_id="32670924"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- In view of the controversy in the Press on the question of
taking stringent measures to repress or check the spread of the Grey
Squirrel, as an inveterate enemy of wild bird-life in Great Britain, it
would be both instructive and interesting if some of our country
members living in counties where this alien has been liberated or which
it has invaded from an original centre of dispersal, would give us their
experiences on the point under discussion.
In the Zoological Gardens I have repeatedly seen these squirrels in
the spring traversing bush-grown banks, glancing now and again
upwards as if in search of nests and ascending the bushes to investigate
and rob, unless prevented, any nest they may sight. Some summers
ago a pair of Wood Pigeons built in a tree near my house,
and passing beneath it one day I was startled by the fall of the
two nestlings at my feet. Looking up I discovered the cause to be a
Grey Squirrel, which had taken advantage of the temporary absence
of the parents to visit the nest and throw out the young. The old
birds would probably have proved capable defenders of the family,
for a few years later one of these Squirrels, bent upon raiding a Missel
Thrush's nest, or coveting the hole in the hollow tree in which it was
built, was completely routed by the hen Missel Thrush, which fearlessly
assaulted the intruder and ultimately drove it into ignominous retreat
by the vigorous strokes of her wings.

FIRE-RED FINCH

<bodyText confidence="0.981456454545454" page_id="32670924"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- I am taking the liberty of sending you a dead chocolate-
coloured Grossbeak, which I have not been able to identify, but which
you might be able to do. I received this bird alive a few days ago,
but in bad health, from Mr. Rogers, of Liverpool. At the same time
Mr. Rogers sent me a pair of so-called " Batetivo " Finches (Svermophila
plumbed ), but the chin and throat of the cock bird were not ashy grey
but pure-white, though it had a white spot at the base of each cheek ;
in fact, the cock bird was just like a specimen of S. albigularis, as
described in Dr. Butler's book, and of which I have a living specimen
in my aviary.

The following reply has been sent to Mr. Mylan :--
I have carefully compared your bird with all the descriptions of
Spermophila (Sporophila ) in the British Museum catalogue, and with
those of allied genera, and I have come to the conclusion that it must
be the Fire-red Finch ( Spermophila minuta), although it struck me as
being rather large for that species and with a beak which reminded
me of Oryzoborus; the colouring of the upper parts, however, does not
agree with that of species in that genus. I. once possessed an example
of S. minuta, but when it ylied it was in poor condition and not worth
preserving, so that I have no specimen for comparison with yours.
It is quite likely that the male bird sent to you as S. plumbea may
be S. albigularis; dealers are at times liable to make mistakes.
A. G. Butler.

{Continued from p. 55.)
Palatka is a nicely situated little town on the St. John River, and was
once famous for the cypress swamps in its vicinity. These, however,
have been mostly laid waste by the lumbermen, so that it took me a
lot of time before I could find out where I could see an untouched
forest. However, with the help of one of the managers of a lumber
company there, I was directed to Oak Creek on the St. John River,
where I found a very fine cypress swamp which included alligators in
the muddy water. Birds, however, were conspicuous by their absence,
and the only bird of interest that I saw was a large black and white,
nearly all black, Woodpecker, which I take to be a specimen of
Phlacotomus pileatus.
From Palatka I travelled to Jacksonville to take a train there for
New Orleans, on the Oulf of Mexico. This journey takes about two
days and a night, and one travels chiefly over devastated country that
has at one time been covered with pine-woods. As one nears the
Mississippi the swamps become numerous, and in one of them I saw a
yellowish Rail, which I was told afterwards was quite a rare bird, and
like all Rails difficult to see ( Coturniceps noveboracensis). Besides the
Rail there were a good many red-shouldered black Starlings in the reeds
of the swamps, also little white Herons were conspicuous, and once

I saw a large blue Heron ( Ardea herodias). Numerous specimens of
Zenaidura macrura were seen during great part of the journey.

F. E. Blaauw--About Birds in North America
Nearly all the trees in the swamps and a great many others as well,
including enormous specimens of Magnolia grandijlora, liguidambar,
styriaciflux, and ev'ergreen oaks, were covered by Tillandsia usneoides,
which formed grey fringes many yards long, and gave all the forests
of Florida and Southern Georgia and Alabama a most weird look.
New Orleans, situated on the mouth of the Mississippi, was terribly
hot, and I was soon driven to the parks to get the fresh air that
I might possibly find there. I first went to Audubon Park, which con-
tained large grassy lawns and not very big trees. In it the Mocking
Thrush was again a very common and rather obtrusive bird, and
besides I only saw a few above grey and underneath white, little birds
which reminded me of our Chiff-chaffs ! There was also a dark-brown
longish songster with a song that reminded me of the song of our
Blackcap, but was shorter and not quite so good. In the ponds were
blue water-lilies, and I noticed that it took one of the flowers, which
was a closed bud when I first remarked it, just about one hour (from
II to 12 o'clock) to expand. Besides Audubon Park I visited the city
parks, but, except lots of black Swans, I saw little of interest there.
From New Orleans I travelled to Tucson, in Southern Arizona,
a journey that takes, if I rightly remember, two days and two nights.
One first travels over the low country of the Mississippi delta and of
Southern Louisiana, which is mostly cultivated, like also Southern
Texas ; then one approaches the Rio Grande and almost touches
Mexico, in El Paso. The country now gets drier, and in New Mexico
and Arizona thousands upon thousands of acres are overgrown with
Yuccas, which at the time of my visit showed their creamy white
flower-spikes many feet long. Opuntias had also gradually appeared,
and the first ones I saw were in low willov r woods, whilst in the oak
copse-woods none were to be seen. The only birds that were at all
regularly seen were specimens of the sharp-tailed Zenaidura macrura
and, more rarely, the smaller short-tailed Scardafella inca.
Tw t o or three times the day before I reached Tucson I saw a mirage,
which conjured a lake with a background of green trees in the Yucca
desert! The nearer we came to Tucson the more numerous became the
cacti, in endlessly varying species. In Tucson I left the train, and in
a temperature of about 116* Fahr. in the shade I reached my hotel.

I had a letter of introduction to a gentleman of the Carnegie laboratory,
and next morning, in the fiery sun, I set out to find him. After some
difficulty I met him in his house, against a hill just outside the town,
and whilst we were making plans for the afternoon in his veranda a
female Red Cardinal came to drink in a small fountain near the house.
About six that same evening we set out in a motor to reach the desert,
with the object of seeing the giant cacti and all the strange vegetation,
the seeing of which had brought me to Tucson. An ornithological
magazine is perhaps not quite the place to say much about the flora
of an Arizona desert, but I cannot help saying that the aspect of the
40 feet high giant cerei of the barrel cacti, the tree cacti, the paloverde,
the creosot bushes, and all the small opuntias and mamillarias, was a
sight never to forget.
Not long after we had been wandering on foot amongst all those
vegetable wonders, I heard a familiar sound, and a large family of
Gambell Partridges (Cal. gambelli) came fearlessly walking round us.
They were cock and hen and twelve full-grown chicks, which were
apparently looking for a perch to spend the night. A large Black
Martin was also common, and apparently spent the night in the holes
which abounded in the old giant cactus trees. There was also a Wood-
pecker that frequented those holes, but he did not come near enough so
as to enable me to see him well. As the evening fell a Nightjar flew
noiselessly around us, and then the sun sank in gold and blood-red behind
the mountains and we w r ent home. My guide told me that the so-called
Road Runner, a long-legged ground Cuckoo, with brown and bull
plumage and a pink mark on each side of the head (Geococcyx
calif or nianus), and which feeds principally on small lizards, is of not
infrequent occurrence amongst the cacti. Unfortunately we did not
see one.
From Tucson, which was rather unpleasantly hot with its 116* in
the shade, I took a train to travel westward to Los Angeles, a journey
which does not take much more than a night and a day. One travels
mostly over cultivated country, and when I arrived at Los Angeles
I found a temperature of 75*, which felt quite chilly after the 116* of
Tucson. Los Angeles is a garden city, and all the houses are surrounded
by beautiful flowers, and the streets are often planted with flowering

trees, amongst which was conspicuous Yacaranda mimosaifolia,
with its beautiful clusters of blue flowers. Los Angeles would indeed
be a charming town if it had not the defect that all North American
cities have, namely, that of having been built on the square system,
which takes away all charm ! One always looks into an endless hole
when one looks into an avenue or street!
Not long after I had established myself into my hotel room, which
had windows opening into a garden, I was gladdened by the sight of
two beautiful Blue Jays (Aphelocoma californica ) that were mobbing a
cat that sat unconcernedly on a wall and tried to look as if it were no
concern of his, those noisy birds ! They are extremely handsome birds,
those Californian Jays, even more beautiful than their Florida cousins.
The colours are more intense and there is an additional pretty light-
blue marking over the eyes. Dr. Frank Chapman tells us that this fine
bird, in slightly differentiated forms, is found throughout the greater
part of the western Lbiited States, southward into Mexico.

A SATISFACTORY BIRD
By the Marquess of Tavistock
" Wanted, Indian Parrakeet; must be reasonable." So ran an
advertisement in Cage Birds w T hich caught my eye some months ago.
The advertiser was, no doubt, thinking only of price, but if he had had
some experience of Parrakeets -- and particularly Ringneeks--at liberty,
the words might have had for him another and deeper significance.
When you give a foreign bird its liberty in order that you may get full
enjoyment of the beauty of its plumage and the interest of its habits,
you soon find that " reasonableness " is a. quality of prime importance.
Sometimes it depends on the species, sometimes on the individual.
Broad-tailed Parrakeets of all species are eminently reasonable so long
as the cocks, only, of properly mated pairs are released. If they stray,
the owner has simply got his own stupidity to thank. On the other
hand, you Can never quite tell what a Palceornis will do. It may stay
in the most exemplary fashion ; it may stay for a time and then go
off ; or it may stray immediately and be seen no more. If, as I hope

The Marquess of Tavistock--A Satisfactory Bird 69
may be the case, the keeping of foreign birds at controlled liberty
becomes more popular, a Palceornis Parrakeet, known to be a good
stayer, should possess a higher value than an untried specimen. I
have at the present time an eminently reasonable " bird in the shape
of a fine male King. If all birds gave me as little worry and anxiety
in and out of the aviary as he has, aviculture would indeed be a hobby
of unmixed joy ! I bought him early in the summer of 1920 as a mate
for a hen acquired a few months previously. He was then about three
years old and very nearly in adult plumage. Although not perfectly
tame, he was steady and sensible and far more civil to his wife than
most males of his kind. Indeed, he soon began to feed her and for a
time I quite hoped that they would breed, but the moult came on
without eggs having made their appearance. Even when moulting
heavily he continued to feed the hen.
Next summer they again came into breeding condition, but the
mistake of putting them in too hot and sunny an aviary caused them to
drop into an early moult. Kings cannot stand a damp, sunless aviary
in winter, but they like a cool one during the hot weather.
That autumn I made up my mind to release the cock, but having
had some previous experience with Kings at liberty, I decided that it
would not be prudent to have the pair loose together. Pairs are not
always good stayers ; they range over a pretty wide area and so far
have never nested successfully and as my place is a small one, on the
outskirts of a good-sized town, I prefer to have birds that keep pretty
close to home. The cock King fell in with my plans perfectly. He went
out very quietly into a magnolia-tree above the aviary, made short
flights and returned frequently to see how his wife v r as getting on.
Never at any time did he stray more than a few hundred yards and
never did he cause me the least anxiety, nor bully the other birds
that were loose. On the other hand, he was far from inactive, and I had
the continual pleasure of enjoying his attractive flight. Although not
fast on the wing, as compared with other Parrakeets, the King is
exceedingly graceful, and has a remarkable power of whisking round
corners and gliding between trees, to alight suddenly without the
usual preliminary flutter of wings. I often used to see him perched on
the top of some tall tree and then a couple of seconds later he would be

on the roof of his mate's aviary, having transferred himself so quickly
and silently that I could hardly believe I was looking at the same bird.
Every morning I used to take round a few grapes to distribute as
titbits. Kings are enormous eaters of fruit and green food and the
cock was usually waiting to receive his share. Occasionally I used to
find him foraging about on the ground under the thick bushes ; he
w T as the only one of my Parrakeets to do this, all the others keeping
entirely to the trees or feeding on the open turf. Palceornis Parrakeets
are wholly arboreal and so are Crimson-wings, anyhow during the
winter. Platycerci feed a certain amount on the ground, especially
during the breeding season ; the same applies to Barrabands and even
more to typical Psephoti.
As a rule the King roosted in the bushes near the hen's aviary, but
occasionally he got temporarily imprisoned in another aviary which
was arranged to catch the Barrabands every night to protect them from
the attacks of the Brown Owl. Fortunately, however, the King comes
in the category of those birds which are safe from the night marauder,
whose crimes in the matter of bird murder are fully as great as those of
his much abused relative, the Little Owl, who hunts by day and leaves
more traces of his repast. I fancy the Brown Owl's many ardent
admirers would be astonished if they knew the extent to which birds--
and quite large birds -- formed part of its winter menu, but its undoubted
destruction of numbers of young rats is certainly a virtue to cover a
multitude of sins. On the first of March I thought it time to catch up
the King for the breeding season. I put his mate in a parrot-cage and
opened the aviary door, and in a very short time he was in beside her
and showed little annoyance at the loss of his liberty.
Although the subject of this article is an unusually accommodating
bird, I do not think the owner of any properly mated pair of Kings
need fear to give the cock his liberty for part of the year, provided
the aviary is well placed where there is no danger of the birds missing
each other when one is released. Last winter I was successful in
keeping cock Crimson-wings at liberty, but although the Crimson-wing
is even more beautiful than the King, he is less attached to his mate,
a wider ranger, rather spiteful with other Parrakeets, and perhaps not
altogether safe from Owls, being not very large, and having only a small
beak with which to defend himself.

By H. D. Astley
I have lately purchased a nice specimen of the Chinese Whistling
Thrush, which I take to be Myiophon$ks ceeruleus. Some of our
members will recall the account of my M. lemmincki, which lived for
about eighteen years, and which was originally reared from the nest in
Cashmere by Mr. Ezra. M. ceeruleus is a&apos;size smaller and has a black
bill in place of a yellow one. The general colour is much the same in
both species ; a very deep purple (rather than blue), with a silvery
metallic glazing to the tips of the body feathers. There is a detailed
description-- Avic. Mag., Vol. VII, 1900-1, pp. 210, 211 (Phillipps)--
so that I think it is not necessary to repeat it, except to say that the
shoulders have a patch of brighter purplish blue. It is a moot point as
to whether the genus MyiopJioneus should be included in the family
of Thrushes. Mr. Seebohm does not do so in his monograph of the
Turdidee. To my mind these Whistling " Thrushes " are much nearer
that family than to any other, although a very distinct offshoot.
They are birds which inhabit mountainous districts where there are
boulders and torrents, and there can be heard their melodious whistle,
which is rather human in tone, but not very varied.
My present bird is extremely tame, as was my M. temmincki ;
indeed, the latter was positively ferocious. These Whistling Thrushes
are stoutly built and larger than a Missel Thrush. Specimens are very
seldom imported ; they could not be trusted in an aviary with small
birds. I remember my chagrin when a Robin slipped through the bars
of my Temminck's Thrush's cage and was promptly torn to pieces.
For an illustration and account of this bird cf. Avic. Mag.. N.S.,
Vol. I, 1902-3, p. 196, etc.

B. Whitlaw--Notes on Various Birds
Some years ago you were kind enough to publish a letter of
mine on the feeding of Nightingales ; on the strength of which the
editor of a well-known nature magazine, who happened to be in the
neighbourhood, called and begged an interview with the hero of the
story. " Tamagno " had just dined and was in rather a supercilious
frame of mind -- however, he came and sat on the mealworm tin while
his visitor grubbed busily for choice offerings which he condescended to
accept--and then calmly went to sleep !
" Well I'm blest," commented the interviewer, contemplating the
round ball of indifference--" Well I'm blest ! "
Both my 'Gales flourished for four or five years and were both
ridiculously tame. " Caruso " lived in the aviary and " Tamagno "
had a large cage, but was usually loose in the room. Whenever
" Caruso " visited the cage or " Tamagno " paid a return call to the
aviary the " language " was a revelation. I am glad to say there was
always wire between them on these meetings, or there would have been
murder and sudden death. " Caruso " was the smaller and more
intelligent of the two, delighting in a game of tug-of-war with me, but
he did not sing. " Tamagno," however, was a great songster. They
were both hand-reared, and are by far the most delightful of all bird
pets ; but Nightingales should only be attempted by experts.
For some years I had a very fine pair of Bearded Tits, who lived in
a big cage--I tried them in the aviary but they would do nothing but
dash madly against the wires and would not feed, so I was obliged to
catch them up again.
I filled a small travelling cage with coarse, dry grass, and they spent
a great deal of time arranging it to their satisfaction, and always
slept in the nest. Every year there were several clutches of eggs, but
no attempt at incubation. One chick hatched under a canary, but
died at once. I never chanced on a wild insectivorous bird's nest at
the right time, or I might have got better results.
Most bird-lovers must have observed queer friendships from time
to time among their q"ets. At one time I happened to have in the aviary
two cock Paradise Whydahs, in full war paint, and a pair of Doves--
a common hen mated to a Turtle I had picked up with his wing half
shot away. For months each Dove was always attended by its own

particular Whydah, who followed it about all day and roosted near it
at night, neither Dove taking the slightest notice of its admirer. The
younger bird at last grew tired of his queer infatuation, but the older
one took advantage of a very spoony phase the Doves were going
through to roost every night tightly jammed in between the two, and
would peck and swear viciously if one of the Doves fidgeted. The
Doves never resented the presence of the intruder.
Have any of my fellow-members noticed how vicious young
Budgerigars can be when about three weeks out of the nest ? I always
found that as soon as they got their yellow foreheads they would settle
down into comparative respectability. That unfortunate crippled
Turtle Dove was always the butt of all their mischief--the usual idea
was to get on his back and try to scalp him. On several occasions
I was only just in time to avert serious trouble.
One young terror used to use the Dove's tail as a swing, and seemed
to delight in the general scuffle which invariably resulted. No sooner
had things quieted down than he would creep along a branch upside-
down and bite the Dove's toes. The look of almost imbecile bewilder-
ment on the victim's face was really very funny ; it never seemed able
to make out where the attack was coming from.
I one day picked up a sorry-looking scarecrow--one could hardly
call it a bird--at one of the London dealers for a few pence. This
half-plucked, dingy object developed into a regular gem of a Lavender
Finch, which ultimately went to the Zoo. He was one of the most
aggravating little rascals I have ever met--except an equally minute
ball of wickedness, a Green Singing Finch.
As soon as he got his clean bill of health I put him into a large,
dome-shaped cage with a lot of other small fry. Every night, when
all the others had gone to bed, he would take nocturnal peregrinations,
hanging upside-down from the top of the cage. When he had had
enough he would drop like a stone, smack ! on top of the sleeping
mites below, and nearly scare them into fits. I always found him quite
unconcerned on a perch in the midst of the general flutter. Nothing
could be more lovely than his delicate grey set off by his tiny crimson
tail--the same scheme of colour affected, on a much coarser scale, by
the African Grey Parrot.

THE KAGU (RHINOCHETUS JUBATUS )

The photograph here reproduced represents the old Kagu which
lived for some fifteen years in the Zoological Gardens and was well
known to many of our members. She was a delightful bird and
extremely tame, and would readily come when called and display her
fine crest. That it was a female we know because she once laid an
egg, and a very beautiful egg it was, or rather is, for I have it safely
packed away in a cabinet.
The Zoological Society has been fortunate enough to secure four
more Kagus, all extremely fine birds, but not so tame as was old
"Johnnie". But they are not really wild, and probably they will
soon become quite tame.
The Kagu is an inhabitant of the island of New Caledonia, where
I am told it is still fairly abundant, and it is much to be hoped that
it may be long preserved, for it is one of the most remarkable of
birds. It has no near relations, but is thought to be distantly related
to the Rails and also to the Sun-bittern of South America. It is
about the size of a domestic fowl, of a pale-grey colour, with the
wings conspicuously barred with reddish-brown and black, the
immature birds being much browner than the adult and its plumage
barred with reddish-brown.
During the last few years Mr. Heumann has been successful in
breeding the Kagu in Australia, as recorded from time to time in this
Magazine. Only one egg is laid to the clutch, and the young bird
when hatched is a very beautiful little creature, according to
Mr. Heumann, clothed in yellowish down, striped with black on the
body and brown on the head. It stays in or near the nest for four
or five days and then commences its walks abroad, leading its parents,
which follow, one on either side. The old bird picks up a worm and
dangles it in front of the chick, who seizes and swallows it.

Recent importations have included a splendid lot of Australian
birds, and as these have been very scarce for years past aviculturists
have had an opportunity of renewing their stock of old favourites.
Messrs. Chapman of Birmingham and Rogers of Liverpool have both
had considerable stocks of these, and the Zoological Society has been
able to secure a few which were specially wanted.
Cat-birds.-- The Australian Cat-bird is one of the Bower-birds
and a very rare species in captivity. It is of a leaf-green with
lighter spots, and appears to be the only Bower-bird that does not
construct a bower. Its name is derived from its peculiar call, which
is a very good imitation of a cat fight. Its home is in the jungle-like
scrub of the coastal regions of New South Wales, and the Zoo has
secured the only pair that arrived.
Regent Birds.-- It is several years since the Zoological Society
has possessed the Regent Bird, another of the Bower-birds, and when
in colour perhaps the finest of all, clothed as it is in gold and velvety
black. Three good immature birds have been obtained, but at present
we do not know their sex, and it takes three or four years for this
species to reach maturity.
The older members of the Avicultural Society will remember the
delightful articles by the late Reginald Phillips, published in this
journal in 1905 and 1906, describing the successful breeding of this
species in his garden at Kensington.
The Satin Bower-bird. --Of this well-known and handsome
species the Zoological Society has secured a single male in full adult
dress, a state that is probably not arrived at before its sixth or
seventh year, the immature male, like the female, being of greenish
colour. The eye of the Satin-bird is of a beautiful sky blue. On
many occasions has this fine bird constructed its bower in the
Western Aviary. Parallel lines of twigs, stuck into the ground, form
the bower, and the bird is never tired of decorating this with bright-
coloured objects--flowers, shells, and so forth.
The Pied Grallina. --This is one of the commonest birds in
Australia; coming into the public and private gardens it is very
conspicuous in its black and white plumage, and as a rule it is tame.

Dr. M. Amsler -- General Notes on Aviculture
I brought home several for the Zoological Gardens in 1908, but none
have been imported since until now, one solitary individual having
arrived. It is one of those common birds in Australia which is not
considered worth bringing home, although it makes a charming aviary
bird and one of the easiest of the soft-bills to feed. In the wild state
it feeds on worms, water snails, and insects of all kinds, but that it
will occasionally eat grain was proved in the old Sydney Zoo, for
some poisoned grain put down to destroy the introduced sparrow
resulted in the death of a number of Pied Grallinas, which also go by
the names of " Mud-lark " and " Pee-wee ".
Rare American Birds. --Mons. Delacour has returned from his
trip to Central and South America with a wonderful collection of
birds, most of which are new to aviculture. They comprise Humming
Birds, Tanagers, Sugar Birds, Parrots, Curassows, and many others.
We hope to hear more of these when M. Delacour has had time to
settle them all into his aviaries.
South African Birds. -- I visited Mr. S. Castang's shop in
Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, the other day, just after the arrival of
a very fine collection of South African Finches, etc. There were many
Violet-ears, Melbas, Queen Whydahs, Red-headed and Green Singing-
finches, Cape Doves, Ground Larks, and many others. On the whole
they had come through in very good condition.

I do not know whether aviculture is on the down-grade, but if
one is to judge by the variety and number of articles appearing in
our Magazine there must be very little doing in the aviaries of
our members.
Only to-day I sorted out the Avicultural Magazine for the
past four years with the intention of having them bound, and I could
not help comparing the present flimsy numbers ivith those fat, well-
illustrated, and interesting Magazines of pre-war days; true, one
or two of our cleverest and most successful contributors have dropped

out, but surely there must be others who could contribute something
of practical interest.
Being hors de combat owing to an accident, I hope to set
the ball rolling by writing a few notes on birds I have kept, and
ending with a plea for the crow-like birds. Soft-bills in general
are looked at askance by a good many whose souls cannot rise
higher than Gouldian and Parrot Finches, but when once you have
kept these latter birds and have bred them you realize their
limitations. They are certainly bright coloured--perhaps beautiful.
Their breeding is quite easy providing you don't interfere too much
and have well-acclimatized birds which don't attempt to nest in
autumn or winter.
Much the same remarks apply to the majority of Waxbills, but
these, to my mind, are much more attractive and graceful birds
than are the Grass-finches. Most of them are fairly free breeders,
and less prone to breed during the cold seasons than the Australian
Finches.
Speaking off-hand from memory, the following have reared
young successfully in my aviaries:--Blue-breasted (almost yearly),
Avadavats, Golden-breasted, Cordon Bleus, Fire-finches, St. Helena's,
and Orange-cheeked Waxbills. I have also reared hybrids between
the Blue-breast .and Cordon Bleu Waxbills, and have once had young
of Yiolet-eared and Australian Crimson Finches, not reared to
maturity. I rather fancy the last-named is usually ranked as
a Grass-finch. Therefore, if you have a mixed collection and more
than one aviary, by all means keep a score or so of Waxbills, which
during the warmer months always look attractive and please those
who visit your aviaries. My own aviaries have good shelters, but
are unheated, and I have come to the conclusion that, though most
of these birds can winter out, they are best kept in a large cage
indoors or in a shed from November to March. This winter under
these conditions I lost four Waxbills, three of which were Black-
cheeks. Those who have kept this species will, I think, agree
with me that I might honestly have put my losses as one, the
Black-cheeked Waxbill being so impossibly delicate. How many
of us have bought small birds from dealers, and on getting home

Dr. M. Amsler -- General Notes on Aviculture
have put them in a nice big airy cage, only to find them dead in
a day or two. These birds, in many cases, were hut newly imported,
and did not die from any septic disease, but from cold.
Baily, that very able and observant keeper at the Zoological
Gardens of London, pointed out this explanation to me some time
hack, and I have since verified it. If one puts one's hand into
a dealer's box-cage containing anything from a dozen to a hundred
birds, it will at once be noticed that the air in the cage is quite
hot, perhaps 80* or 90*, and over and above this the birds are
usually huddled together; is it wonderful that they get chilled
when put into a travelling box for a few hours and then have to
spend the night in a temperature which perhaps falls to 50* ? The
remedy is obvious. All newly bought birds, if they come from
a dealer, must be kept in a specially heated cage. I propose making
such a cage this year, and shall have more to say about it later.
These remarks apply with much less force to Soft-hills and the
larger birds which are not kept crowded together before we buy
them. To my mind, the Soft-bills or insectivorous birds are by
far the most interesting and intelligent of our aviary inmates,
and if I had to plump for one genus I should choose the Thrushes.
Let anyone who disagrees with me glance through Seebolnn's
Monograph of the Turdidse. There is scarcely a bird illustrated
which is not beautiful, and many are gems which we would
almost sell our souls to possess. Already a fair number of beautiful
species have reached us alive, and have done well in captivity ;
perhaps the Blue-headed Rock-thrush ( Petrophila cinchloryncha )
from the Himalaya mountains cannot be beaten. There is a fine
male in the small bird-house at the Zoo. Another handsome species
from the same locality is the Chestnut-bellied Blue Rock-thrush
(Petrophila erythrogastra). I have a pair of these at the time
of writing which have been in my possession some five months,
but both birds have some difficulty in producing flight and tail
feathers, and I much fear I shall not succeed in breeding from
them. Less rare than the above, hut very beautiful also, is the
Orange-headed Ground-thrush ( Geocichla citrina). I have a pair
nesting at the moment, the male kindly lent me by Mr. Teschemaker.

This is a species which I have bred almost annually for the past
ten years.
Lastly, I have a pair of Migratory Thrushes, the American
" Robin ", which are also nesting.
Last year I brought back from France a pair of Pied Rock-
thrushes, but unfortunately lost the hen. The male is just finishing
his vernal moult, and looks very beautiful with his powder-blue head,
orange breast, and white rump ; he is, moreover, a fine singer
when the spirit moves him, but he prefers, as a rule, to sing a little
human ditty which no doubt he learned from the foolish person who
hand-reared him.
Practically all the Thrushes are good songsters, even the brightly-
coloured species ; they are easily tamed by means of mealworms, and
are to my mind much more intelligent than the vast majority
of seed-eaters. Faults they have: it is not often possible to keep two
pairs together in one aviary during the breeding season, but they
do not interfere with other birds which are not closely allied, and
the males are given to murdering their wives when the season is
over. Sometimes it is the females who attack the males. I usually
manage to mix up the pairs during the autumn and winter in
different aviaries, and do not have much trouble, but the sexes must
be separated at once at the first sign of disagreement or there will
surely be a mangled corpse in the aviary one morning.
Perhaps more intelligent even than the Thrushes, though less
lovable, are the Jays and Pies. I have not sufficient aviary room for
a large collection, and as breeding is always my first object when
I get a pair of birds, I have to be satisfied with one, or at the most
two, species. For merely spectacular purposes a large mixed
collection can easily be kept in a roomy aviary, and there are
few sights to equal that of a dozen or more species flying about
together in an aviary 30 ft. or 40 ft. long ; these I have actually
seen at Mons. Delacour's at the Chateau de Cleres.
The aviary can be a very rough affair--the higher the better--
with a good-sized shelter and plenty of feeding trays to prevent
squabbling; the netting need not be smaller than one inch, as
mice would be very welcome visitors to these birds. In such

an aviary breeding is, of course, quite out of the question, for
any eggs laid would almost certainly be devoured at once, and
young birds, if hatched out, would quite certainly be taken by the
other inmates of the aviary. My experience with the Corvidae is
that it is difficult to prevent the parents themselves making a meal
off their young, but more of this anon.
Should any pair of a mixed series show definite signs of wishing
to nest, the only possible course is to catch them up and put them in
an enclosure to themselves.

Sir, --The much-respected James Yealland, of Binstead, Isle of
Wight, who recently passed away after a long suffering illness, sent
me a few weeks ago an uncommon whitish headed Mannikin. As far
as I could ascertain without comparing it with skins in the Museum
it was Munia pallidiceps (no black centre to the belly), chest
downwards being dusky and mottled lightly. It resembled M. flavi-
prymna rather than M. maja or ferruginosa, and apparently comes
from Lombock. I have possessed alive M. pectoralis, castaneithorax,
flaviprymna, maja, ferruginosa, atricapilla, malacca, punctulata,
topela, risoria, subundata, two species of Uroloncha and four of
Spermestes and several other allied birds, but the example submitted
tallied with a written description of M. pallidiceps alone. It is the
first time I have seen this bird; it is the sort of bird one would
expect to be produced from a union of M. maja with M. flaviprymna.

{Concluded from p. 80.)
I think I must have been about 14 years of age when I took
a couple of Jackdaws from a pollard elm, which was hollow almost
to the ground level. I well remember the incident because
I scrambled down the inside of the hollow trunk, and it was mere
desperation and a prospect of a slow and lingering death which
enabled me to get up again with my two prizes.
One of these birds I kept: he was full-winged, and had his
liberty in a small London garden. His tameness I have never
seen equalled, and he never strayed but once, when he flew into
the bathroom window of an old lady. She was so irate that
I suspect she must have been having a bath.
I kept this bird for several years, and he died one summer
holiday during my absence. My next two birds were a Jay and
a Magpie, both taken from the nest on the same day. For some
reason neither of these ever became really tame, and I blush to
say I have no recollection of their ends. After this I kept no birds
till I started practice here, when I received three half-fledged
Ravens from the Hebrides ; needless to say they were hungry on
arrival, and I shall not easily forget the face of the man who
carried the travelling box from the station.
One may forget to feed a young Thrush or Lark, but one cannot
forget three lusty Ravens, even if well covered over for the night;

Dr. M. Anwler -- General Notes on Aviculture
they begin to clamour at 6 a.m., and can be heard at a distance
of 50 yards. They ate anything and everything, and grew
amazingly fast.
Having at the time only a small garden, I had to cut their
wings to keep them at home, and even then they were very
troublesome. A large clump of German iris would be demolished
in a few minutes, then one of the dogs would be attacked, or
they pecked the baker's legs when he called for orders, and he
refused to come again. Finally, I gave two of the birds away
to two Eton College masters who had admired and coveted them.
One of these was a keen rock-gardener, and he soon found that
his raven had an eye for his rarest plants, so the bird was relegated
to the stable yard, where he ended his days by drowning in a
rain-water tub.
The other bird, which I gave to one of the science masters,
was kept in a small aviary of which he showed his disapproval by
cawing from morning till night. Some hoys in the neighbouring
house became so incensed by the noise that one of their number
was chosen to " poison " the bird. This boy crept along the coping
of the wall against which the raven's aviary was built and gave
the bird its dose, which it swallowed quite happily. The result
was nil, which is not surprising seeing that the most potent drug
these boys could produce was a couple of cascara tabloids !
My own bird remained Avith me for a couple of years; he
could kill a half-groAvn rat in an instant, and Avas an inveterate
thief and very destructive to garden plants, as I never liked keeping
him in a cage. Still, if I had a very large garden, I should certainly
get another. This bird Avent to Devonshire, and Avas still alh T e
a couple of years ago; if he has not since died he Avould hoav
be about 16 years old.
Shortly after this I began to build aviaries, and my first venture
in the crow tribe Avas a pair of Chinese Azure-Avinged Magpies
(Gyanopolius cyaneus). These birds are not much larger than a
Missel Thrush, and Avere quite the most delightful of the Pies
I have ever kept. They made no attempt at nesting, and I
unfortunately lost the male in the autumn.

There is a closely allied species in Spain which anyone at all
interested who has friends in Spain should try to import.
Both Chinese and Spanish species have been bred in the
Zoological Gardens. In 1915 I bought a pair of Occipital Blue
Pies, which nested in a small aviary and reared one youngster from
the first nest; the second brood was going strong when the nest
collapsed, but I was able to rescue two chicks before they died. One
only survived a few hours and the other died in a couple of days.
I fear I am a poor hand at hand-rearing anything but the easiest of
birds. I had hoped that the rearing of the Blue Pie would entitle me
to a medal, but it was discovered that Lord Selford had bred them
the previous year.
The next year Mr. Guy Falkener lent me a pair of Yucatan Jays
which had been deposited at the Zoological Gardens. These birds
nested twice; on the first occasion they reared the young to the age
of 17 days and then I believe ate them. On the second attempt
the young disappeared after about four days. The season being then
over, I had to return the birds, which had by then been presented to
the Zoological Society. I believe they again nested unsuccessfully in
the Gardens the following year.
Last year there was a large importation of Yucatan Jays--
so called--these were really the San Bias Jay. The Yucatan has
yellow legs, whereas the San Bias legs are black ; otherwise there is
very little difference between the two species. I had five birds sent
to me from which I was able to pick a true pair. These two were
very friendly all the summer; the hen always comes down first to
collect such titbits as mealworms, cockroaches, etc., and invariably
gives them to the cock, who eventually returns at least part of the
repast to his mate. I have already pointed out this peculiarity in my
article on the attempted breeding of the Yucatan Jay. I believe that
this transference of food from one bird to another is a favourite trick
with many Jays and may occur between two birds of the same sex.
Only to-day for the first time I noticed the male collecting food and
feeding the female. I trust that this may mean that he intends
business.
The only other pair of Jays I have at the moment is the Azure

Dr. M. Amsler -- General Notes on Aviculture
Jay, of which several were imported and sold at a very reasonable
price last summer. The colour scheme is much that of the Yucatan,
but the bird is much larger and heavier and has a short tail. He
should be called the Azure Crow.
By the Avay, why are these birds called Jays? The Pileated Jay
is certainly a Jay, hut the Yucatan, at any rate, is as much a Pie as is
the Occipital Blue Pie or our own Magpie. The former certainly has
a small superciliary ridge of feathers on each side suggesting a man
who brushes his hair upwards, but there is no suggestion of a central
or movable crest.
When the Azure Jays first arrived they were placed in the same
aviary as the Yucatan Jays and a pair of King Parakeets, and for
a time I began to think that I was quite mistaken as to sexes; the hen
Yucatan insisted on feeding both Azure Jays, and one of the latter
fed the male Yucatan. However, as spring approached it became
evident that this promiscuous love-making was only a passing phase,
and the new arrivals began to have rather a poor time, although so
much larger and more powerful than their companions ; they would
soon have starved had I not removed them to another flight. I have
since had to remove the King Parakeets also, as they evidently intend
to lay on the ground as they did last year, and this would certainly
have meant loss of eggs.
So far neither pair of Jays have ever shown any sign of wishing
to build, but the season is young and I still have hopes, though
I don't think anyone will ever make a fortune by breeding any of the
Corvidae. As I have already said, the birds are prone to devour their
own young, and I certainly think they are more resentful of inter-
ference than most birds.
I hesitate to lay down the law, as I have only reared one bird to
maturity, but I feel very strongly that if one is to succeed when
young are hatched it is absolutely essential to give a very large
amount and variety of animal food. Young sparrows are easy to
procure and are fairly well received by the old birds; an occasional
frog is also liked, mealworms by the hundred during the first few
days, and likewise cockroaches, woodlice, earwigs, and even garden
worms; but the greatest treat you can give these birds is a mouse,

and a nest of young mice about a week old will fairly make them
dance with pleasure. My birds get butcher's meat twice a week and
a little cooked meat on other days. I almost think they prefer the
latter. They are very fond of picking bones, and always have the
carcase of any chicken which has been eaten in the house--the
Christmas turkey, or what remained of it, also gave them much
pleasure. t
Finally, while on the subject of food, I want once more to ask
aviculturists to try my ground rice mixture ; it is made by pouring
a little boiling milk over ground rice, which is then well stirred; the
result is a thickish paste, which is sweetened with " honey-sugar ".
There is not a bird in my aviaries which does not eat it--Waxbills,
Bullfinches, Siskins, Tits, Thrushes, Nuthatches, Serins of various
kinds, and finally the Jays. I give my birds what I consider to be
the best soft-bill food on the market, but the ground rice is always
eaten first. New birds always take a day or two before they eat it,
but they soon follow the example of their aviary mates, and I am
quite sure it suits them; and, as I have already noted in the
Magazine, I have a pair of Lorikeets which for the past six years have
reared from three to four broods annually, and which now never look
at anything else--neither fruit, greenstuff, or seed.
To return to the Corvid(R), before closing my somewhat aimless
wanderings it might help would-be breeders to have a short list of
the better-known species which have to my knowledge been reared in
captivity. These are the Raven, British Jay, Magpie and Jackdaw,
Occipital Blue Pie, the Azure-winged Magpie (both Chinese and
Spanish sub-species). There are doubtless others which without
books of reference I cannot remember. Species which it would be
interesting and pleasing to breed are the " Yucatans ", including
San Bias and Beechey's Jays, the Pileated, Blue-bearded, and
American Blue Jays, the Hunting Crow or Cissa from the Himalayas,
and lastly the Azure Jay, of which there must be a fair number at
the moment in private collections.
As I have learned to my cost, these birds are not quite so easy to
breed as- Budgerigars or Zebra Finches, but this only adds zest to
one's endeavours. There are three difficulties to be overcome---first

the choice of a, true pair, a by no means easy matter ; next the
provision of a suitable nesting site and nesting materials if and when
they are inclined to nest; and finally the selection of suitable food
for the rearing of young when they hatch, providing they are not at
once eaten by their parents.
The market will never be flooded with aviary-bred Jays, but those
that are reared might make charming pets and could he given
the run of a large garden. Mr. Astley has a delightfully tame
Yucatan Jay which is allowed out in his garden and which returns
to its cage, and there is an Occipital Blue Pie on deposit at the
Zoological Gardens which I much covet, as I feel sure this bird
with a little care could be given semi-liberty. It would be a fine
sight to see this, the most graceful of all the Jays, flying loose
out of doors.

RECORD OF THE RED TAIL-FEATHERS
OF A GREY PARROT

By E. Maud Knobel
I had this Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus) on 30th May, 1917,
and have kept a strict record of the number of red tail-feathers that are
shed each year. Feathers have a great interest and fascination for
me, and in the keeping of records, of course, one has to choose certain
feathers and those that are easily identified. I don't know whether
there is anything to be learnt by keeping a record or whether anyone
else has ever done such a thing. One knows certain facts about
moulting. For instance, a bird about to moult starts by clearing up his
seed-pot, and for a successful moult requires a more generous diet than
on ordinary occasions. They have to make blood to push out the
old feathers and produce new ones. I am not a great believer
in medicines and tonics, but I do think one is tremendously rewarded
by always giving the best foods one can procure. I was taught this
during the war, when foods were anything but what they should be,
and many of my Parrots either took a long time to come through the
moult or produced poor feathers and in some cases blotched with yellow
feathers where green ones should have been.

My experience is that the first feathers to be shed are the bastard
feathers of the wing. One also knows, too, that when a bird sheds a
feather in one wing the fellow in the other wing is almost certain
to come out within a few minutes. Some birds seem to moult a little
all through the year, while others do a good out and out moult, looking
perfect scarecrows for a week or two, then coming out beautiful. I
find my Amazons mostly do this. They generally make a clean sweep
of everything. I don't mean to say they become absolutely bare, but
they look pretty ragged and untidy. My Grey Parrot, on the other hand,
never does this, but sheds a few feathers at a time, and never looks
anything but absolutely spick and span.
Therefore the enclosed record of the tail-feathers shed in a year
covers the whole year and is not confined to any particular period :---

Of the above those marked with an asterisk are new to the
Zoological Society's collection, and of these perhaps the most interesting
to the aviculturist is the Grey Pigeon, which is a very rare bird in
skin collectioirs. It inhabits Borneo and Sumatra, and has never
before been imported alive so far as I know. In colour it is of a very
pale grey, the primary feathers and their coverts and the apical half
of the tail being black, while the iris is bright red. The species formed
the subject of a coloured plate in the Catalogue of Birds in the British
Museum.
The White-bellied Finch may very likely have been imported,
though I do not remember to have seen it. It is a dark-coloured

Perhaps the most charming birds in the whole collection are the
Crowned Wood Partridges, in which the male is of a rich bluish-green,
the wings rich brown, and the head decorated with a crest of purplish
red and a vivid white patch on the crown. The hen is nearly as pretty,
being grass-green with chestnut on the wings and a greyish head.

Mr. Collingwood Ingram. The chicks were unfortunately not reared,
but Sir William believed them to be the first ever seen by a civilized
human being. They are described as being covered with down of a
uniform dark chocolate brown. This is a bird of the dense Malayan
jungles, which, judging from its habits in captivity, probably never
comes much into the open, but spends its time in scratching amongst
decaying vegetation in search of insects and small seeds.

Some people prefer birds which have bright colours in their
coloration--a plumage in which is a large proportion of blue, yellow,
green, and such-like--and the Parrots seem to have become favourites
with many persons chiefly for this reason. It has sometimes seemed to
me that certain birds were too gaudy in coloration ; and, on the
other hand, I have found several birds at one time or another exhibited
in aviaries which were interesting and attractive in appearance, although
there was no gaudy colour in their general plumage. In this paper have
been mentioned a few of the latter, with some description added in
order that any reader unacquainted with them can recognize a specimen
if he or she should later on see a living one offered for sale, and like to
try it in the aviary.

\0x25A090 F. D. Welch -- Interesting Birds ; even though Plain-coloured
(Garrulax picticollis), which conies, I believe it correct to state, from
South China, was always an interesting bird in the Western Aviary of
the Zoological Gardens, where I first saw one several years ago now,
hopping about and pecking on the ground, and generally active.
The general coloration (as written at the time the bird lived) was a
yellowish-brown, with chin, throat, and breast whitish ; the side of the
head posterior to the eye being ornamented with several black marks,
as was also the side of the breast where was a bluish-slate patch with
some blackish spots on it (there being about an inch between these
patches on each side). In this living bird the first two primaries were
blackish, and there were also some black spots on the tail about half-
way to its tip, and as it hopped about this rather large bird of
thrush-like shape always seemed to me to be more interesting to watch
than Macaws in their gaudy blue, yellow, red and such-like bright
plumage.
Another bird which will, to my mind, compare favourably in general
appearance with any of the Parrot tribe -- not excluding the gorgeous-
coloured Westerman's Eclectus female -- is brown and white in most of
its plumage. The combination of these, brown in body, etc., with a
white head, neck, and upper breast produce an attractive bird in the
White-crested Jay Thrush (Garrulax leucolo&apos;phus) of the Himalayas, in
which the crest is well developed and appears capable of being raised
erect when the bird is excited. A large black beak also improves its
appearance, there being a continuation of the dark along to the eye
in a broad line ; and when a pair of these is seen flying in an aviary
from bough to bough, or pecking on the ground and generally fussing
about, they surpass (in my estimation) any one or other of the Green
or Red Eclectus, or of the Lories in general appearance and interest--
even though brown and white in most of the plumage.
A third, not perhaps so attractive in general appearance as the last
but a neat-looking bird and one which is interesting to watch, is the
Chinese Jay Thrush (Garrulax chinensis), even though of sombre colour
in its slate-coloured plumage with black face (except white cheeks)
and chin.
Birds which are mostly black or mostly white might be thought
unattractive in being clothed with such ordinary colour, and despised

therefore by many persons. Years ago now there were two which used
to regularly sit on one of the perches in the Western Aviary in the
Zoological Gardens and amused me by making an occasional dash
about the aviary-compartment after flies and such-like, and were nice
birds. The larger was a large Backet-tailed Drongo, black, but none
the less interesting to me as it sat with a cheeky, impertinent look in
its eyes ; the other, a smaller bird, a White-bellied Drongo--black, with
white belly. Both were, so far as I now remember, Indian birds, and
with their rather large beaks seemed to show an ajDpeaiance in head
and neck as partly Crow and partly Shrike shape. Unless my memory
has miscarried, they both did a little squalling at times, and were lively
exciting birds, frequently on the move backwards and forwards between
the inner and outer sections of the aviary, and much like the Indian
Crow (Oorvus splendens) in flight. But not too noisy ! Two which
hunted on the ground after food, much like the Starlings on lawns in
Britain, were Grackles; one being the Black-winged Grackle
(Gmcidvpica melanoptera), a white bird with (as its name implies)
the wings black. It was not unlike a British Starling in general shape,
and stated to be from Java -- but whether it ranges into other islands
around or on to mainland Asia I am unable to say for certain. Perhaps
the co-Editors will inform us more about this latter question ? The
other was not so nicely marked a bird (in my opinion) as its more
white ally, it having black on the crown, neck, back, and wings, with
a collar round the neck from which it presumably was named Black-
necked Grackle, the other parts of plumage being white.
I can fancy hearing some enthusiastic admirer of gaudy plumages
saying in derision as he or she reads these latter birds' descriptions :
" Fancy admiring a bird in black and white ! " Well, it is perhaps a
good thing that all human beings who admire birds don&apos;t all like the same
colours and shajjes, or some birds in menageries might die of low spirits
and melancholia on account of being ignored by visitors !
Personally I preferred the above seven birds to any seven species of
the Parrot tribe -- even to Lories, which seemed to me most interesting
to observe of that noisy group of gay colours.

By Frederick D. Welch, M.R.C.S.
When in London in August, 1920, I watched some birds in the
Great Aviary of the Zoological Gardens in order to compare, if an
opportunity occurred, their fighting with the Bitterns, previously
mentioned in the Magazine, Ser. iii, Vol. XI, pp. 104-5, because Night
Herons have beaks -which seemed to me to be capable of inflicting
a severe peck on a hostile bird.
Two scenes were interesting to watch, although not equalling in
interest that of the two Bitterns seen many years before -- about 1903
or 1904, so far as I remember. When one of the Night Herons was
standing iu the shallow water, a second bird approached it and
apparently tried to take some food it had in its beak. Both birds faced
each other, and kept on alternately bobbing up and down by rapidly
crouching half-down and immediately raising rapidly to full height,
then crouching, then raising, and so forth. During this action
neither bird advanced or retreated, but kept standing in the same parts
of the pond ; and each seemed to me to be trying to find an opening in
the opposite bird's defence in order to get in a decisive peck at head
or body. They were, however, very equally matched in activity, and
after about twenty-five bobbings up and down they parted without
damaging each other, the second bird retiring and dying to a bouglx
where it croaked (apparently giving off some rage at its unsuccessful
adventure) while the first bird remained in the water--the croak being
much like a frog's. Later on, tvvo Night Herons engaged each other in
a dispute about food, one bird starting it with a running attack at the
other which retreated a few feet, but always facing its opponent; and
then retaliated with a similar running attack against the original
aggressor, which also retreated in turn, but facing in exactly the same
way. The birds alternately attacked and retreated in this way, running
forwards and backwards over the same ground time after time ; but each
Night Heron took care to keep away from its adversary's strong, pointed
beak, which latter procedure showed a disinclination to co&amp;gt;ve to close
quarters in battle on either side, they being (as the others before them)

very equally matched in activity. After about five minutes, during
which they continued as above described, they parted, neither bird
having gained any advantage in pecking.
Although they are only sombre in appearance in their pale slate
plumage with darker slate crown and back parts, the Common Night
Heron has always seemed to me a well-proportioned bird in shape ;
and shows to most advantage (in my opinion) when stalking along the
ground towards night-time, with head lowered somewhat, and wings,
back, and tail carried on about the same level as the head, the beak
directed and pointing straight in front of it, walking rather rapidly.

Although it is known that the Fishing Eagle, like the white-headed
emblem of the United States, watches the Osprey for a chance of robbing
it of captured fish, it is, I believe, the common impression--it certainly
was mine--that Eagles as a class are, for the most part, independent
hunters, disdaining piratical methods of picking up a livelihood. That
this opinion is erroneous, like many an opinion formed by readers of
natural histories deprived of the opportunity of watching the behaviour
of wild animals at liberty, is shown by a chapter headed " Aerial
Robbery " in a delightful little book In Nature's Garden, recently
written by Mr. C. H. Donald. In the hope that the account may interest
aviculturists as much as it interested me, I venture to reproduce the
substance of the incidents as graphically described by the author.
One day in India some commotion was observed amongst a number
of small birds, and a flock of Mynahs took refuge in a bush suppiving
very inadequate shelter. Suddenly a pair of Falcons appeared from a
clump of trees. One rose into the air, while the other descending within
a few feet of the ground, approached the bush at top speed, shot upwards
and then dropped like a stone at the bush, driving out the Mynahs by
the ruse. The tiercel poised aloft, then took up the chase, and stooping
at the flock succeeded after one or two failures in striking one of the
Mynahs. Thereupon a Pallas&apos;s Fishing Eagle, which had been awaiting
such a chance on the summit of a tree hard by, hastened to the spot.
The Falcons saw the danger, and while the male rose high in the air

and attacked the Eagle to distract its attention from the tiercel, the
latter made for the trees, carrying her prey in her talons. Disregarding
the onslaught of the Falcon, the Eagle went after the tiercel; but
before he could get up to her another robber, this time a Tawny Eagle,
appeared on the scene. The tiercel dodged his first swoop, but at the
second dropped her prey, which the Tawny Eagle grabbed before it
reached the ground. Then the Fishing Eagle made for the Tawny,
and the latter, turning upon her back in self-defence, gave the former
the chance to.grab the Mynah, and in the tussle that ensued the two
great marauders came fluttering to the ground together. A second
Tawny Eagle now came up, but contented itself with circling round the
combatants without entering the fray. The next arrival was a Steppe
Eagle who sat down alongside and looked as though she meant business,
but before she made up her mind there was a great swish of wings, and a
fine female Imperial dropped from the heavens and without any
hesitation went straight into the melee. The Tawny let go her hold
almost immediately, and flew off, but the Fisherman hung on for a
few seconds and then he, too, resigned himself to the inevitable, and let
go. He, however, did not fly, but merely walked off a few T yards, and
turned round again to face the Imperial. The latter, having secured
the bone of contention, raised herself to her full height, and erecting
her neck feathers in her anger, gave vent to a succession of raucous
calls. Still other Eagles continued to arrive, although ten minutes
before there was not one to be seen, apart from the Pallas's Fishing
Eagle, which was on the spot when the luckless Mynah was struck
down by the Falcon. Finally there were no fewer than seven Eagles,
belonging to five species, on the scene, namely, one Pallas's, one Imperial,
one Spotted, two Tawny, and two Steppe. Some of these were circling
above the spot, the others squatting round the Imperial, which made
no attempt to eat the Mynah clutched in her claws. The Fishing Eagle
sat passively by ; but the author, finding the scene getting monotonous,
advanced towards the company, whereupon all the Eagles on the
ground took wing, except the Imperial and the Fishing, which refused
to stir, so intent were they watching one another. Finally, however,
when Mr. Donald was within 25 yards of them, the Imperial rose
into the air. This was evidently what the Fishing Eagle had been

waiting for. She was after the Imperial in a second, and being infinitely
faster caught her up and attacked her from above with vigour. The
Imperial half turned to receive the attack, but, whether from losing her
balance or being actually struck, came to the ground--and again the
Fishing Eagle sat beside her. Mr. Donald continued to advance, and
this time the Fishing Eagle took flight, having a smack at the Imperial
in passing. When the latter took wing the Fishing Eagle did not renew
the attack, because the Mynah was gone, swallowed at one mouthful,
Mr. Donald believed, either as the Imperial Eagle came to the ground,
or when the Fishing Eagle had his parting shot at her.
That this is not an exceptional case of the robbery of Peregrines by
Eagles is shown by the following incident observed by Mr. Donald.
" Suddenly there is a whir of many wings as a large flock of Mallard,
Pintail, and Teal rise out of the reeds. Hardly have they gone a
hundred yards when the steady, onward, rising flight is turned to a
medley of zig-zags, and a dash for the river. A bolt from the blue has
descended on the luckless flock in the shape of a fine dark Peregrine
Falcon." The Ducks divide, but the Falcon struck in the middle of
the whirring mass of wings, and brings her quarry to the ground.
But, realizing that the place is too exposed to prying eyes, she presently
takes w r mg, followed by a couple of Kites, which, hov r ever, she out-
strips, despite the burden she carries. Another pursuer now takes up
the chase, to wit, a Steppe Eagle, which strains every nerve to catch up.
The Falcon, nevertheless, has the advantage in distance and altitude,
and appears to be escaping from the Eagle, when two black objects
appear in the sky above her, coming down at tremendous speed. They
are a pair of Pallas's Fishing Eagles. Profiting by the advantage of
position in the air, one of them strikes, compelling the Falcon to drop
her prey. The other Eagle, following behind, catches the falling Duck
and sails away with the Peregrine, Kites, and Steppe Eagle in hot
chase. The Falcon, mounting to the zenith, stoops with terrific
velocity on to the successful robber, which avoids the onslaught with a
zig-zag turn, and pursuers and pursued disappear behind some distant
trees, leaving the observer to guess the outcome of the episode.
Of all the Eagles Mr. Donald tells us about, the Golden is the only
species which dares eat his meal in the open, or even drop it from her

Sirs, -- &apos;On crossing the Atlantic (in March) from Southampton
to New York, on the White Star liner Olympic , my son and I were
daily on the look-out for any sea-birds. Only on one stormy day did
we see a kind of Petrel following the ship for a short distance ; our
nearest land then w r as the Azores, more than 500 miles away.
We have had some very severe storms here (in South-West Texas).
The other day I saw some hundreds of Seagulls, also a large white
Pelican was shot, measuring over 10 feet from tip to tip of wings.
These had been blown inland by the gale ; the nearest sea is some
hundreds of miles away, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico.
Some time ago four white Swans were secured here, whose breeding
place is in the Arctic Circle.
This part of Texas is quite tropical ; I am staying in the Virgin
Forest for some weeks, at the house of my brother (who is quite a
naturalist). The weather is very hot; for some time past it has been
90 degrees in the shade. This is quite a paradise for birds.

American Wigeon ; most of the Mandarin eggs were fertile but the
germ died at about 10 days' incubation. However, I have over 100 young
ducks and eggs hatching nearly daily till further notice. Some have
been most persistent; Shoveler, American Wigeon, Spotbill, and some
others have laid three clutches each ! I have forty young Carolinas,
some three-quarter grown, and more eggs to hatch. Cinnamon and
Chestnut-breasts have failed to go to nest so far ; I can't think why.
Falcated have laid well, but are not off yet. I'll let you know 7 later full
results. H. Wormald.

By F. E. Blaauw
(Continued fromp. 68.)
Close by the town of Los Angeles is Mount Lowe, which is easily
ascended by a dental railway which creeps almost perpendicularly
against the mountain. I was very much struck by the peculiar aspect
of the vegetation against this mountain, as the leaves of both trees and
shrubs and bushes were mostly of a silvery hue. So, for instance, the
needles of the Douglas pines (Pseudosuga douglasi macrocarpa ) were
silvery blue, greyish or bluish were the leaves of the lupins (bushy as
well as herbaceous ones), and silvery were the leaves of innumerable
other things. To match these silvery leaves, a great many flowers were
of a pale yellow or delicate lavender blue. I saw very few birds during
this excursion, and the only interesting species I noted was a specimen
of Sayornis nigricans, a nearly all-black bird with little white, which
looks like a long-bodied and long-legged Flycatcher.
Another excursion, easily made by electric tram, is to Palissade
on the sea-coast. For a couple of miles along the coast is a promenade
or drive, which overlooks the sea and is planted as a garden. I was
rather surprised to see there a family of black Molothrus Starlings
(M. obscurus), which consisted of a pair of old birds and several young
ones, which were carefully attended to and fed by the parents. I was
much surprised to see this, as I had been told that this species was
parasitica] and laid its eggs in the nest of other birds. One of the
young birds was apparently rather feeble, and not able to fly well,
and when I picked it up the old birds flew round me greatly concerned
for the safety of their child. I am at a loss to explain how this

experience agrees with the supposed parasitical habit of these birds !
Along the promenade, which was perhaps from 50 to 100 feet
above the sea-level, very big sandy-brown Martins, with a white spot
on each side of the body, flew&apos; restlessly backwards and forwards with
such rapidity that the eye had difficulty in following them.
From Los Angeles I travelled by train to del Monte, which is a large
hotel in the vicinity of Monterey. It is situated in a finely timbered
park, which for once was well stocked with birds. The first birds
I noted were Californian Crested Quails ( Callipepla californica), which
were seen running from bush to bush and were quite tame. Then there
were numerous families of Junco pinosus, pretty grey birds with black
heads and yellowish bills, which were mostly running along the lawns
caring for their children, which were brown in their first plumage.
Very conspicuous were numerous black and white Woodpeckers of the
Melanerpes family. These birds behaved quite differently from our
white and black Woodpeckers in Europe. To begin with, they were
more on the walks than on the trees, and were often very busy inspecting
the horse droppings ; then for a change they would catch insects on
the wing as nimbly as our Flycatchers. They would also sit on the
roof of the hotel inspecting the passers-by, or inspect the tall stems of
the pines, in which they had driven round holes to conceal nuts, which
formed a favourite article of diet. Then there were Bush Tits
(Psaltriparus minimus ), Crested Tits ( Parus inornatus ), Chickadees
(Pams rufescens), and an occasional Humming Bird (Calypte anna),
which seemed to be mostly of a glossy green as it darted along. On
a small lake in the grounds I noticed some young grey Grebes with
light faces, probably young birds, also slaty-grey Coots with black
heads and light bills. In the bushes round the lake Songsparrows
were singing lustily, and this reminds me of a legend about the Song-
sparrow, which reads as follows : --
When God had created the world and had distributed the birds,
He had forgotten some parts of North America. When He was reminded
of it, He had only very few birds left, and those mostly inconspicuous
ones, and the little Songsparrow, which at the time was not only a
modest but also a silent bird, was amongst the number. The result
was that the country which got him was dissatisfied and said that

he was not worth having. So the Creator, for fear that the little
bird should be neglected or persecuted, ordained that henceforth
he should have a pretty song which he would repeat all day and vary
in a thousand ways, and thus be at least the equal of so many finely
coloured birds that are silent. And since that time the little Song-
sparrow has sung his pretty song all day long, varying it in a thousand
ways, and has been the delight of all who hear him ! But he has
remained an unobtrusive modest little bird which sings his song under
the shadow of a leafy bush and does not come forward to be admired !
A famous excursion from Monterey is the so-called " Seventeen
Miles Drive ". It is a drive round a peninsula, and one passes mostly
through woods of Finns insignis, which have as undergrowth a shrubby
Mimulus, with orange flowers ( Mimulus glutinosus). Bushes of
Lupinus arboreus, with pale yellow flowers, are also very numerous,
especially near the sea. There are several small rocky islands near
the coast, and on them I saw great numbers of Pelicans in the adult
and in the immature dress ( Pelicanus rnfescens), which roosted there in
company of large Blue Gulls and small Black Cormorants. One doubles
the corner of the peninsula at Cypress Point, where many centuries-
old specimens of the Monterey Cypress ( Cupressus macrocarpa) have
withstood the storms for untold ages.
From Monterey I travelled to San Francisco, and there in Golden
Gate Park I met again my old friend the so-called " Robin ", or
migratory Thrush, which had here replaced the Mocking Bird of the
south. Golden Gate Park is a very fine park, not only full of interesting
birds but also full of exotic shrubs and trees, which thrive very well
in the mild Californian coast climate. The birds I noted in this park
were numerous Nuttall's Sparrows, which are brownish, with blue-
grey heads and black stripes. On an artificial lake were a pair of
Erismatura, of which the male had a black head and white face
(Erismatura jamaicensis). When the birds had a sleep on the water
I noticed that they put their heads on their backs and then lifted
their tails from the water, sticking them up perpendicularly. When
this position was assumed nothing could be seen of the white face of
the male. Rather often seen in the lower bushes were pairs or families
of pale-grey birds which reminded me of the European Long-tailed Tit

both in shape and behaviour but had no long tail ( Psaltriparus
minimus). I was told that they were resident in the park. I also saw
a few Siskins, of which the males were yellowish-green, with black
heads. On a small lake were several Coots with young, which were
pearly-grey with dark necks and horn-coloured bills.
One of the great sights of San Francisco is that of the seal rocks,
which are, or rather the rocky coast opposite is, easily reached by
electric tram. Just opposite the rocks is Cliffhouse, a large restaurant,
which, however, at the time of my visit, was closed, it not being able
to exist on visitors that were only allowed to drink ice-water. A little
to the right of Cliffhouse is, however, a small Japanese tea-house, and
this is the best place imaginable from which to observe the rocks.
The group consists chiefly of three large rocks, although there are some
smaller ones. In the middle towers the largest rock, which forms a
huge stone pyramid. On the north side is a smaller, more flattened
rock, whilst on the south side there is a small one shaped much like
the middle one, but not nearly so high.
The low flat rock is preferred by the Sea Lions, as it is the easiest
one to get on to, but the others are also used when wind or high water
make the flat rock undesirable. At the time of my visit there were
about sixty Sea Lions on the rocks, and from the little tea-house it
was quite amusing to watch their doings. The sea round the rocks
was apparently full of fish, for every moment one of the animals would
drop into the water and get up with a fish, which he would swallow with
his head above the surface. These were Steller's Sea Lions, and the
males attained a great size. This kind is not to be confused with
the Sea Lions we see in captivity in Europe, specially as performing
animals in the circus. Those belong to a smaller species which occurs
from Golden Gate southward (Zalophus californianus), whilst Steller's
Sea Lion extends northwards from Golden Gate.
The upper part of the central rocky pyramid was inhabited by a
large colony of small black Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax brandti), who,
at the time of my visit, were nesting. The greater number of the nests
had chicks in them, whilst others were apparently still incubating.
The rock on the south side was generally covered by great numbers of
blue Gulls with white heads and red bills (Heermann's Gulls), and also

by a few larger ones that were white with blue backs (Larus occidentalis).
These Gulls had no nests on the rocks as far as I could make out.
If a Sea Lion after having caught a fish came above the water to
swallow it, the Gulls would at once be near him, and if he was not
very careful they would succeed in taking the fish from him. In this
case he would dive again and in a few seconds be up again with another
fish. On one occasion far away at sea towards the south-west I could
see through my glasses a great cloud of small black sea birds, apparently
Petrels, that were after some food or other on the surface of the sea.
On the Californian coast behind Cliffhouse there is a hill called
" Sutroheights ", after its owner. On the top is a country house,
whilst the immediate vicinity has been planted as a park, and is open
to the public during the day. Against the slope of this hill were
numerous families of Californian Quails that took not the slightest
notice of the crowd of automobiles and foot passengers on the road
below. This Quail is quite a common bird in the parks of San Francisco,
and as it is so confiding it is easily noticed.
In Golden Gate Park there is a small zoological collection.
American bison were there, of course, and also some Wapiti, but the
best thing I saw there was quite a large herd of rufus Kangaroos.

La Guadeloupe, the first landing-place since sailing from France. The
beautiful bay of Pointe-a-Pitre, with its high mountains in the back-
ground, its low coral islets, covered, as well as the shore, with coco-nut
palms and mangroves, is incredibly green, and the scenery is a perfect
and lovely example of what one in Europe has dreamed of a tropical
island.

102 Jean Delacour--Notes on Field Ornithology and
impression. Everywhere the same picturesque hills, covered with
tree ferns and other beautiful vegetation, rise high above the rich coast,
between the blue, clear sea and sky. I only spent a short time in all
these islands, but in Martinique, where I stayed two weeks in November,
and two weeks again in April, thanks to the kind hospitality of the
Governor, I could visit all points of interest in the island and become
acquainted with what I think is one of the most charming spots in
the world.
In the West Indies birds are not plentiful, but the fauna is very
peculiar and interesting. These islands lost most of the larger forms
of bird life soon after their discovery ; the beautiful Macaws and
Amazons have disappeared everywhere, except in Dominica, St. Lucia,
and St. Vincent, sparsely populated colonies, where the fine Versicolor,
Guildings, August, and Bouquet's Amazons still exist in small numbers.
The smaller birds had held their own till recently, when the dreadful
Mongoose was introduced to fight and destroy the poisonous Snakes,
the terrific " Fer-de-Lance The result has been the almost complete
destruction of the ground-breeding and living birds. The Partridge-
Pigeons ( Geotrygon ), several Troupials and Thrushes are now doomed
to near extinction. There is no bird market in Martinique, and
indigenous birds are very seldom kept in captivity. I saw in cages
a few canaries, Parrots, and small birds from Cayenne or Venezuela.
Nevertheless aviaries are not uncommon, and a few amateurs keep and
breed very good foreign birds and even mammals.
The commonest bird of Martinique is the so-called " Blackbird "
(Merle), who belongs to the genus Quisqualus and is really a relative
of the Troupials. It is of the size of a Starling, and has rather similar
habits. The males are glossy black ; the females and young dark
brown. These birds are found as well in the towns and villages as
in the plantations ; they avoid the wooded hills. A feature of these
birds is their quaint and pretty call, which can hardly be termed
a song, and their boat-shaped tail. They nest in colonies on trees,
where they build huge nests of twigs. I brought home two pairs
of Martinique Quisquales (Quisqualus inflexirostris) ; they now live
in an outdoor aviary, where I hope to breed them. They are kept
on the same lines as Starlings and Mynahs.

Another very common bird, in the gardens and the country, is the
charming Quit or Sugar-bird (Coereba martinicana), locally called
" Sucrier Each island and several parts of the South American
Continent has a particular species of Quit. All of them are tiny
birds with curved bills and short tails, black, white, yellow, and grey
feathers. The Martinique Quit is almost entirely black, with yellow
underparts, and, according to age, yellow or cream-white eyebrows 5
the base of the bill is red. They are easily caught, and live well on
the usual mixture of Mellin's food, honey, and milk, and insectile
food. They are rather delicate when first caught, and on the journey ;
they generally get very dirty and sluggish, but soon recover, and I have
now eight of these active and bright little birds in perfect plumage.
I landed nine, and lost half a dozen on the way to Europe. The three
West Indian Humming-birds (Sulampis jugularis, Sericotes holocericeus,
and Bellona exilis) are gorgeous and very abundant. As my late
friend the Marquis de Siegur had brought the three species to France
in 1914 I did not try to capture any, as I preferred to import Guiana
Humming-birds. Two species of Seed-eaters are plentiful in Martinique
--the Grey Finch (Euethia bicolor) called " Cici ", and the Red-throated
Finch ( Loxigilla noctis). Both are easy to catch, but difficult to
keep at first. I landed only one male Cici, a very small grey bird,
with almost black head and breast, and five Red-throated Finches,
one adult male and four young ones. These latter are grey and
resemble in shape a Bullfinch, with a smaller head and beak ; the
male is jet-black, with red throat and eyebrows ; it is a very handsome
bird. There is in Martinique a very nice song-bird of the Tyrant
family (Elainea martinicana) called the " Siffleur ", a plain grey bird
with a crest, most charming in shape and character. Several young
ones were brought to me, but only one survived ; it unfortunately
died in a fit one month after its arrival in France. A Grey Thrush
(Cichlherminia herminieri) also died soon after it reached Europe.
As a consequence of the cold weather my birds had to suffer on the
journey from Havre to Cleres.
My collection of live Martinique birds was completed by a pair of
Passerine Doves ( Columbula passerina) and nine Martinique Doves
(Zenaida martinicana), a fine Pigeon, of a rich rufous colour, varied

with black marks and brilliant voilet reflections on the next, very
similar to the well-known Zenaida auriculata.
A very interesting fact, so far never recorded in any work on
ornithology, is the migration through Martinique of the Guiana
Parrotlet (Psittacula passerina). These little birds arrive from the
north in February and March as a rule, and remain three to four weeks
in the island. I was fortunate enough to see several flocks of them and
to bring home a pair caught near Fort-de-France. They are typical
P. j&amp;gt;asserina. On my knowledge no author has ever reported the
presence of this Parrotlet in the Northern West Indies, and it is to be
hoped that further observations may be made.
There are in Martinique many other interesting birds that one
would be glad to have in aviaries, but owing to their scarcity I would
not capture them. As an instance, let me mention some charming
hours I spent one afternoon in a wood of giant tree ferns on the slope
of the " Montagne Pelie ". One remembers that twenty years ago this
awful volcano destroyed the city of St. Pierre and its suburbs, causing
in three seconds the death of all the 40,000 inhabitants. Now every-
thing is quiet again, and the tree ferns which have grown since the
eruption are some 30 feet high, so rich is the vegetation in the West
Indies. A family of birds inhabited the Tree fern wood : a pair and
three young Clarinos (Myiedestes geniharbis), or " SifHeurs de Montagne " *
The Martinique species is, I believe, superior to all others in beauty and
song. This graceful bird, of the size of a Sparrow, with its delicate
short bill and long legs, is truly delightful ; its elegant and simple
dress reminds one very much of that of a Cossypha caffra, an harmonious
mixture of pearl-grey, orange, buff, and black. These birds only live
on the hills, above an altitude of 1,000 feet. The five Clarinos were
sitting in the shade, sometimes flying to catch an insect, the only
other feathered inhabitants of the wood being gorgeous garnet-throated
Humming-birds. It was a wonderful sight, these handsome birds in
the stately tree ferns ; but more beautiful still was their concert,
The male was singing all the time, and the young ones joining him now
and then ; I had never heard before such a melodious and pure voice.
Its own song is most varied, but the Clarino still mimics perfectly
human whistling ; I tried Arpeges and other tunes, which he answered

By E. Maud Knobel
I was much interested in MisS Whitlaw's remarks on " queer
friendships " amongst birds in her article in the May number of the
Magazine, and a propos of that I saw a strange episode of this kind
at the Canal aviary at the zoo the other day. I went to look at the
Leadbeater Cockatoo that was born in the Society's Gardens last year
and who has recently been turned out into the open-air aviary.
There he was sitting on the top of a perch, preening himself in the
sun. As I looked, suddenly a little Quaker Parrakeet, of the smaller
variety, flew across the aviary and made straight for the Leadbeater,
settling down beside him and immediately starting to pluck his breast.
I expected to see the Cockatoo resent this liberty and take the Parrakeet
by the scruff of his neck and fling him away, but not a bit of it; the
Leadbeater began to gently comb the top of the Quaker's head, and
then, as if some instinct told him the little Parrakeet needed warmth
and protection, he opened one of his beautiful wings and put it entirely
round the little bird, completely covering him, so that nothing could
be seen but the green tail coming out at the back. There I left them,
but visited them again the next day, when the same thing happened,
and I thought it was one of the prettiest sights I had seen in bird
life. A week later I saw them again, but things had changed ; I don't
know what had happened, but they were both asleep at opposite ends
of the aviary, and when I spoke to them the little Quaker came to
the bars to me to be petted instead of going to the Cockatoo.
I may add that the Leadbeater is the only specimen of his kind
in the aviary, and there are three Quakers, but two are of the larger
kind and are very much taken up with each other, so I suppose these
two felt rather left out in the cold and thought they would console
each other.

INJURED LEGS IN BIRDS

By Frederick D. Welch.
Some people hold the opinion that injuries to legs of birds occur
only when in captivity. This is an erroneous view, because two wild
birds have, to my knowledge, injured themselves (not counting
immature Rooks falling from nests).
The first of these was an immature Green Woodpecker, which fell
out of a large forest tree near here on a windy day in 1918. Presumably
it was on the edge of the nest-hole and a gust of wind made its foothold
unsteady, for it fell to the ground when an acquaintance of mine was
passing, and when brought to me had a compound fracture in one foot.
The other case occurred in our garden in spring of 1921. Two Hedge
Accentors had a series of quarrels, extending over some days--
presumably two males quarrelling about a female in mating--several
of which took place on some wire netting round a fowl-run. Exactly
what occurred I cannot say, because it is -impossible to keep wild
birds under observation every minute of every day ; but one of them
got its leg damaged, very severely sprained even if not a fractured bone,
and was hobbling about on one leg only for two and a half weeks.
Probably it got the injured limb twisted owing to being caught in the
network somehow. The Woodpecker died twenty-four hours later; the
Accentor probably recovered, as it was not found dead. Two fractures
in foreign birds have both been in long-legged species, which would
seem to be more likely to be injured as result of slipping during running
than shorter-legged birds.
Of these, the case of the red-legged Cariama, which fractured its
leg on the ship voyage from Brazil, has been already mentioned by
Mr. Pocock (Avicultural Magazine, 1920, p. 191) ; but it seems worth
adding that the fracture healed well. When last seen by me in August,
1921, the bird had quite lost the limp which was markedly noticed up to
January previously ; and the only evidence of former injury as it stood
near its larger male companion was the thickened mass of new bone
around the ends of the fractured bones a few inches above the toes.
In that month it ran, to my knowledge, without difficulty. This result
does very great credit to those who attended to the after-treatment in

the Gardens, because care is required in these rapid runners to prevent
the bird getting over excited, and so avoid any risk of refracture in
future months through the original break in the bones. Had the bird
slipped and fallen in the months following the injury through trying to
run (as it did in January previous to my knowledge), it is highly probable
a refracture would have occurred ; and had such an unfortunate thing
happened it would be unlikely that the fractured ends of bone would
unite a second time. This case proves convincingly what can be done
to lengthen the life of a long-legged bird by attending to the fracture
scientifically with splints, and also careful after-treatment; and if any
future accidents occur in birds the Cariama case shows the desirability
of not hilling the bird, as was done in the case of the other, a Rhea of
South America, which broke its leg when running in an enclosure.
Both these latter were quite healthy birds. It would therefore seem
that if a long-legged bird falls with its leg doubled under it in certain
positions, comparatively little force is sufficient to snap the bone.
[The question as to whether it is advisable to attempt to set a
fractured limb by means of splints and bandages depends entirely upon
the nature and position of the fracture. In some cases a satisfactory
repair is impossible, and the bird has to be destroyed.-- Eds.]

Dr. Hopkinson is on his way home from Gambia, and will probably
have arrived by the time this is published. He is bringing home
a collection of birds, amongst which are Cordon Bleus, Firefinches
(Common and Spotted), Grey Waxbills, Combassous, Hyphantornis and
other Weavers, Yellow-backed Whydahs, Broad-tailed Babblers, etc.
He writes that he will be willing to sell some of these for the benefit
of the Avicultural Society, after paying the ship and rail charges,
which in these days are very heavy. He says he would prefer
that they should go to where there is a chance of their breeding, and
that he will not undersell the dealers.

two to London, but unfortunately his arrival coincided with the change
from warm to cool weather. They were placed for one day in cages in
the Bird House at the Zoological Gardens, but one which had frayed
wings and could not fly, died. The other, which was for Mr. Astley,
was temporarily taken charge of by the Hon. Mrs. Bourke, who, by
dint of unremitting care and attention, kept it alive until Bailey, the
Zoo keeper, was able to conduct it personally to Brinsop Court.
Some idea of the difficulty in keeping Humming-birds can be
gathered from extracts from a letter from Mrs. Bourke : " You will be
glad to hear the Humming-bird is very well. I got it safely home,
with a temperature of 75* all the way, as it was hot and the sun out
just the half-hour we were in the train. I packed the cage with two
small hot-water bottles, covered it in brown paper, and left an end
loose which I raised in the train, so it fed all the way. ... I heated
some water and put it in the milk tin and held it in front of the bird,
and you should have seen its delight in bathing and splashing like
a big bird, and then preening itself. All this was at midnight and
the cage at a temperature of 85*. ... I am keeping it now at a
temperature of 75*, as it seems to have quite recovered its breathing
and only pants if one has to handle it to get it up on to its perch. . . .
I find this one much worse than a baby, as anyhow that sometimes
sleeps, but this never seems to."
So far I hear this little bird is still alive and doing well at Brinsop
Court, and Mr. Astley will, I hope, tell us how he has provided the
necessary temperature without which these mites succumb like flies.
They are delightful birds in captivity, providing one has the facilities
for keeping them in a uniform temperature of from 75* to 80* Fahr.,
powerful electric light to take the place of sunlight when this is absent,
and an attendant whose whole time is devoted to them !
The species of Humming-birds above mentioned was Thalurania
furcata, from Guiana, known as the Cayenne Wood Nymph. There
are many genera and species of Humming-birds, some of which occur
at considerable elevations and comparatively northern latitudes, and
some should therefore be far less susceptible to changes of temperature
than others.

Resignation op THte Honorary Secretary and Treasurer
At a meeting of the Council held on 14th June in the Offices of
the Zoological Society of London, a letter was read from Mr. J. L.
Bonhote regretfully announcing the necessity, owing to ill-health, of
his resignation of the offices of Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of
the Society.
Miss Knobel's offer to undertake the duties, at all events until the
end of the year, was gratefully and unanimously accepted by the
Council. The chairman moved that a vote of thanks be passed,
expressing the great appreciation of the Council for Mr. Bonhote's
valuable services to the Avicultural Society and their sincere sympathy
for his illness and deep regret at his unavoidable resignation of the
double office he had so competently filled. This, having been seconded,
was unanimously passed.
A New Feature in the Magazine
Monsieur Delacour and Major Pam jointly proposed that the
Society should undertake to publish in the Magazine a monthly series
of illustrated articles on Aviculture to begin as soon as possible and
extend over a period of three or four years ; the general scheme of
the proposal being as follows :--

In Nature's Garden. By C. H. Donald, F.Z.S. London : John
Lane, the Bodley Head, 1922. Price 7s. 6d. net.
Before receiving a copy of this book for review we published in
the Avicullural Magazine for Jane an account of some of the author's
observations upon the habits of Eagles, feeling sure that they would
interest our readers. What we then said was almost sufficient
recommendation of the volume ; but no attempt was made to give
an idea of its scope and contents. It consists in reality of a series
of chapters telling the experiences of a naturalist and sportsman after
Deer, Bears, Bharal, Thar, Panthers, and other big game in the
Himalayas. One chapter is devoted entirely to the habits and
behaviour of that quaint Indian bird, the Saras Crane. Mr. Donald
has a great sense of humour ; and this gift pervades the book, making
it exceedingly pleasant reading. He also writes well in other ways,
and some of his accounts of the animals are presented in the style
with which Thompson Seton has made us familiar. The volume,

Sirs, --Some time back I wrote you an account of my tame Rook,
who has been my companion now for over ten years. A fortnight ago
an incident occurred which I think is of general interest. I was ill
and in pain ; this presented me in quite a new light to the little lady ;
she was very puzzled, came on my shoulder, looked very intently at
me ; then an idea struck her ; she flew off, filled her beak with some
rice from her saucer, and then proceeded to feed me as they do their
young, pushing it between my lips and teeth on to my tongue,
repeating the process three or four times. This was continued some
days till I went away for a holiday. She has not considered it necessary
since my return. I may add that this was done in the presence of
witnesses. I should like to know if any one has had a like experience
in modern times ; it very much recalls a weary, depressed prophet
and ravens in ancient history.

Sirs, -- It may be of interest to mention that while touring the
Zoological Gardens some years ago--about 1909 -- one of the keepers
told me that one of the stall had had a " Harpy Eagle sit on his arm ! "
when it was being removed from its travelling compartment into the
permanent cage in the Gardens.
As I knew him by sight I tried to find him to hear what it felt
like, but could not that day. Eight days after this I met him, arjd
pulling irp his sleeve he showed his forearm ; also a description of the
event was given me. There was no need to ask where the bird had
gripped him, because the positions where its toes had gripped were
at once seen by the black bruise marks cdl along the course of the toes.
It surprised me. It was clear on looking at that arm--a strong muscular
one -- so bruised that the grip of this South American bird must be
terrifically strong when both feet are brought into action, and their
whole strength applied. The exact date I cannot give, but am of
opinion the bird referred to was the Harpy Eagle ( Thrasaetus harpyia)
mentioned on p. 55 of the report of the Council of Zoological Society for
1909 as presented by our member, Captain A. Pam, on 11th August
of that year in a collection from Venezuela.

By J. Delacour
Since leaving Martinique, two days ago, the heat has been
unbearable, and this morning the mountainous coast of Venezuela
is at last visible. The port of La Guara, where we land, is scorching
hot, and we leave it with all possible speed in order to cross the
mountains which separate it from Caracas. The precipitous sides of our
undulating road are of red rock, and are covered with a sparse, often
prickly vegetation, consisting mainly of cacti.
Caracas, a Spanish type of town, is situated in a high valley (900m.),
surrounded with mostly bare mountains, only the ravines being wooded.
The object of my journey, however, is to see birds. In the town itself
there are some " Qu'est-ce qu'il dit ", as Pitcmgus rufipennis is called in
the Antilles and the Guianas. They are to be found on the roofs of
houses, and on telegraph wires, and make a deafening din. They amuse
me, but I know they will become maddening. Further on the squares
resound with the cries of the blue and black Tanagers, which are to be
seen flying to and fro. In the middle of the town, situated on a hill, is
a public garden called Le Calvario, and there all kinds of birds abound.
Tanagers and Tyrants are to be seen in company with various species
of Finch, Boutons d'or, Thrushes and Humming Birds being especially
abundant. In the Calvario there are a few cages in which local mammals
are exhibited : Jaguars, Pumas, Agoutis, Peccaries, etc. There are
also some captive Crocodiles and a few birds, the Macaws, Guans,
Curassows (Daubenton's and Razor-bills), and a Caurale Soleil (?)

attracting special attention. In the vicinity of a small pond are some
large Egret.
Vast coffee and sugar-cane plantations are situated in the valley
in the neighbourhood of the town. In the coffee plantations are some
very large trees, chiefly the evergreen Erythrina, which harbours many
birds--Hang-nests, Trogons, Tyrants, Tanagers, Quit-quits, and on the
paths which border the plantations may be seen Anis, Mocking Birds,
Troupials, Sugar Birds, and Humming Birds.
On ascending the neighbouring hills we find many kinds of
Humming Birds ( Phactornis , Saucerottea, Chlorostebin, Agyrtria),
yellow and red Tarn is (?), and Tanagers in great abundance. From the
trees re-echo the blows of the small Woodpecker, whilst a few Cardinals
are to be observed flying to and fro. It is, however, to the wooded
ravines, where there is always water in the form of small streams,
that one has to go if one wants to observe the beautiful Callisle and
other sumptuous Tanagers, the Sugar Birds and the Quit-quits, a fact
well known to the bird-catchers of Caracas, for it is there that they set
their snares. I take one of these bird-catchers into my service,
and reap a rich and interesting harvest. Callisle arthuri, C. cyanoptera ,
C. airicapilla, C. guttata, C. cyanescens, Violet Tanagers, Sugar Birds
with blue heads, and a magnificent Tanagra olivicyanea are caught as
a result of our efforts with lime twigs and traps.
In spite of the splendour of their plumage, these beautiful birds,
with their brilliant yellow, blue, and green colours, are rather hard to
see when in the branches, where they incessantly pursue one another,
uttering shrill cries. But what a feast for the eyes, and what excitement
when one sees them flv down, approach the trap, and get caught. In
these wooded localities one comes across other, less showy birds, as,
for example, Cuckoos, Dendrocolaptes, and Ant Birds. Now and again
some rapacious bird, a Caracara or Chima-chima, flies by, but as a rule
without doing any harm. Everywhere horrible black Vultures are to
be observed soaring about with astounding ease.
The town of Caracas itself is full of interest for the ornithologist.
Cages are suspended in front of many windows and shops. If we expect
to spot rarities we are doomed to disappointment, as the majority only
contain Canaries. A few, however, may sometimes contain Mocking

Birds (Mimus gilvus), Red Tanagers, Hooded Siskins, Yellow Tanagers
(S. chrysogaster), and Canary hybrids, which are very numerous and
very popular, some exceptionally coloured varieties fetching very high
prices. Yellow-backed Cassiques ( Cassicus persicus) are also to be seen
kept in small cages ; they are often quite tame, and are very enter-
taining as they imitate all the noises they hear. Troupials ( Icterus
icterus and I. chrysocephalus ) are other song-birds in cages that one
may come across, the latter being obtained at a great cost from the
Orinoco district. Other Venezuelan species are not kept in captivity.
At the Caracas market there is a very charming section where flowers
and birds are sold, one side of the market hall being reserved for the
former, the other side for the latter. In elegant cages of fine workman-
ship, constructed of slender fibre, Canaries, Parrakeets ( Conurus and
Psittaeula), Tarnis (?), Cardinals, Troupials, Sugar Birds, Quit-quits,
and Tanagers are offered for sale. There are seldom any other kinds
of birds. The most popular are the Troupials and seed-eaters, which
fetch from 30 to 80 francs each. Although birds can be purchased
in the market on any day in the week, the finest selection is on sale on
Sunday mornings. At Maracay, situated at a distance of 200 kilo-
metres west of Caracas, near the great Lake of Valencia, is the official
residence of General Gomy, the President of the Republic. The
President is the owner of a kind of farm, and being an enthusiastic
naturalist he has transformed it into a zoological garden. The animals
he keeps there in small but well-kept cages include a five-metre-long
Crocodile, a Tapir, Jaguars, Pumas, a pair of African Lions, Monkeys,
including an Albino Capuchin Monkey, and various other local creatures.
A large enclosure, through which runs a stream, is inhabited by hundreds
of great and small Egrets, mostly with full wings. Mixed with them
are a few old and discoloured Water-fowl. I also note an Orinoco Goose,
a beautiful sight in its pearl-grey, black, and reddish-brown livery, with
its carmine beak and feet. How I should like to bring some of these
back to Europe. 1 Some small and uncomfortable looking aviaries
contain Toucans, Colins, and a few small birds. At liberty are to be
observed all kinds of game birds, and midst this crowd are a number of
1 I managed to bring back three Orinoco Geese from the region of Apun.
They are, at the time of writing, at Cleres, in perfect condition.

Frederick D. Welch--Some Crows
hybrids between Chickens and Guinea-fowls, and some Curassows, of
which two species -- Pauxis pauxi and Mitua tomentosa -- are of special
interest.
Perched on fences are some Guans, Penelope montagnii, and Ortalis
ruficauda, and a few Red Ibis. I have, however, left to the last the gem
of the whole collection -- a magnificent pair of Kamichis (?), which with
full wings are at perfect liberty. As we approach the male is on the
ground. He does not move, but makes his hostility to us apparent by
his behaviour and deafening cries. The female, perched on the top of
a young tree, answers his call by a more subdued cry, and proceeds to
fly heavily round and round. It is impossible to get tired of watching
these handsome birds. I notice that their frontal horns, which measure
more than 10 centimetres, are thin, flat, white, and resemble a slender
whale-bone.
On the shores of the Lake of Valencia, among the reeds, a few
Manassius (?), some Flv-catchers, Fluvicida pica, and numerous Marsh-
birds are to be seen. Jacanas are also to be observed gracefully flying
to and fro. Everywhere, running about on the roads, we come across
numbers of Scaly Ground Doves ( Scardafella ridgwayi), Passerine and
Talpacoti Doves ( Columbino griseola and C. tcdpacoti). The bushes in
this part of Venezuela are full of birds -- various kinds of Tanagers,
Troupials, Tyrants, of which the magnificent " Bull-blood "
(Pyrocephalus saturatus ) is of brilliant scarlet. On the farms Hang-
nests abound, and all the trees harbour enormous nests made of twigs,
the work of the very common Grey Ant-eater; finally the houses are
treated to the beautiful song of the Agile Wren ( Troglodytes clarus).
The ornithological fauna of the neighbourhood of Valencia, Puerta
Cabell a, etc., does not differ to any extent from that of Caracas.

The early experiences of people have, I suppose, some part in framing
their likings in after years when they are growing up into manhood
or womanhood. Be that as it may, some of the birds which were intro-

out that in later years any bird called a Crow or at all resembling
the outward appearance of a Crow had greater attractions for me than
various other sorts of birds whose plumage was more bright and varied.
The birds above referred to were some four or five individuals of
the Indian Crow which used regularly to frequent the garden and
compound of the house at Bangalore, Southern India, where I first saw
the light of day. They not only came quite close to the outside of the
building (much as a European Robin does), but soon became so tame and
impudent that they walked without hesitation into the rooms. I took
great delight in attracting them inside by holding out bits of meat and
other food, and they soon began to live a sort of semi-domesticated
existence at the house, being also welcomed by the native nurses
employed by my parents. But, on the other hand, they were almost
always exiled for the time being when my father returned home from
his duties--sometimes after a book or other suitable missile had been
sent rapidly at them -- because they soon became by no means shy or
nervous at helping themselves to food on the table ! The more unruly
they became, the more I liked them !
What specially amused me was to see them peck holes in tablets of
soap with their strong beaks ! But this did not exactly improve it for
washing purposes, especially if some food remains had been previously
on the Crow's beak ; and the outcome of these incursions into the house
was that this early attempt at aviculture was not exactly encouraged
by my parents--much to my sorrow ! Finally an arrangement was made
between me and my parents that the birds should only be admitted for
a short time each day -- which seemed to me as a child better than total
banishment of my feathered friends.
Coming now into recent years, there was one of these birds in
the Western Aviary of the London Gardens in January, 1921, which I
noticed when introducing a lady friend to some of the birds there; and
it created the impression in my mind that it would soon get as tame
with persons who interested themselves in it as did the ones referred to
in the opening lines of this account.
If any member wants a pet, why not try an Indian Crow ?
This bird, known as Corvus splenclens scientifically, shows some
resemblance in colour of plumage to the Jackdaw, being a mixture

Frederick D. Welch--Some Crozes
of black and grey, with dark iris, black beak and legs. It has, so far as
I know, a general distribution over all India from Cape Comorin to
the lower ranges of the Himalaya Mountains, where it comes into
conflict at times with the Lammergicir or Bearded Vulture (Gypciems
harbatus), arising out of disputes over food ; but as the Vulture is a
large bird of about 42 inches long, it presumably does not trouble itself
overmuch when chivvied by irritable and angry Crows !
I cannot say offhand at the moment whether the Indian Crow is as
great a pilferer of the eggs of other birds as is the Grey Crow ( Corvus
cornix ) and Carrion Crow ( C. corone) of Europe ; but I have been told
it will pick up a golf ball in its toes and fly away with it, which action
suggests it would not hesitate to take any bird's egg it might find. If
so, in captivity it should be kept alone and away from any other birds
which are nesting--for the welfare of the nesting birds. The voice is
much like " kerr, kerr ! " and is to my mind a pleasanter sound than
that of Rooks. It may not be out of place to remark here that these
latter will also carry off a fowl's egg in their toes if they find any laid
astray in field or hedge in similar way to Crows. This action I have
seen done by Rooks several times.
Several years ago there was a CroAV from Persia in the London
Gardens labelled Chaplain Crow, Corvus capellanus, which Avas, so far
as I remember, an all-black species. Can any member tell anything
about these \
While admitting that my friend of early childhood is a nice-looking
CroAV, I cannot agree completely Avith Mr. Frank Finn's remarks in
his book, The Birds of Calcutta, when he compares this Oriental bird
with others of the tribe, and claims Corvus splendens as the " sleekest,
glossiest, and best got-up felloAV of the lot," p. 1.
What about the West African bird, known as Corvus scajndattis,
or the White-necked CroAV ? The contrast of its white breast and
collar, Avith the black of the rest of plumage and black beak and legs
makes it, in my humble opinion, a handsomer bird than the Indian.
A picture of it may be seen in the Royal Natural History, vol. iii, p. 310 ;
and the iris Avas brown in living birds seen by me.
Whether it will get as tame and impudent as the Indian bird I
cannot say -- but perhaps Dr. Hopkinson can inform about its doings

from Iris experiences in Gambian region ? Perhaps he could say also
whether white varieties (all plumage) are at all common in the species--
analogous to varieties in our native Kook ?
When looking at individuals of this pied Crow in captivity, the white
afore-mentioned, which is normal, seemed to me to suggest the possibility
that the black parts would be more likely to freak into abnormal white
in occasional individuals (thereby producing an all-white bird) than
would the plumage of one or other of the Crow tribe which was all-
black in its normal condition. Any information about its habits would
be of interest, it seems to me.
Reference to the "true Crows" above-mentioned, with their stout
bills, recalls to my mind an amusing affair with a friend of mine, which
happened in 1903. Being informed that my friend had " bought a
Chough Crow ", I expected to see one of the birds not far removed
scientifically from true Crows, and known as Red-billed Chough
(Graculus eremita )--also sometimes called the Red-legged Crow, as,
for instance, by Jardine in 1827, when he visited the Isle of Man,
where these birds were very abundant--a bird with comparatively
slender beak. However, when my friend and I reached the shop to
bring the " Chough Crow " away, I saw at once that it was a Jackdaw !
My friend had paid the money and seemed delighted with the bird,
which was very tame, and the old shopkeeper seemed genuinely
ignorant as to differences between Chough and Jackdaw, and so it seemed
to me best to leave them alone after remarking : " Why, it is exactly
like the Jackdaw I kept at Devonport, which came down the chimney as
a young one ! " Still, they both regarded " Jack " as a Chough ; and
so the bird was termed on the receipted bill, and we brought it away.
All tea-time we argued about the delightful pet, but my friend would
stick to her " Chough ", and so we agreed good-naturedly to differ
about its name ; and to bridge over the disputed point, I suggested the
name of " Jack Chough " for the pet (what its sex was seemed
immaterial!), and so it got called.
Some months later my friend told me she had been in the Natural

account is given in the July Magazine, p. 108, died at the end of that
month. I had been away from home for three weeks, and on my return
I saw that the little bird was not looking as healthy as when I left him,
but my bird-keeper had looked after him well, and was exceedingly
anxious to keep him going.
His cage was hung in a lavatory where liot-water pipes run up
inside the wall, and in addition to this a carbon electric light bulb was
kept burning, so that the temperature was usually 75 degrees or a bit
over. At night the cage was covered over, and his food was given
fresh every morning and afternoon. The carbon light gives out a
great deal more heat than the ordinary wire.
The Humming Bird had several twigs of fuschia to perch upon,
raised an inch from the tray, which was covered with blotting-paper.
The little bird seemed to digest his food well, and used to enjoy dipping
into a tin of tepid water, but he could not fly, and although he had
moulted a lot of minute body-feathers, he had not dropped any primary
wing feathers, which were merely shafts, the webbing having worn
off on the long voyage from Venezuela through the feathers becoming
soiled with the honeyed food ; and perhaps the fact of his being
deprived of the power of flight was his undoing.
The little bird was what would be called in good condition, the tiny
body quite plump, but his breathing never seemed quite right, and I
can only suppose that the internal organs were adversely affected
through lack of exercise. I was sorely disappointed, for after keeping
him a few weeks I had every hope of doing so for a few years ! I shall
ever be grateful to Monsieur Delacour for giving me such a treasure,
and to Mrs. Bourke for her kindness and ability in saving his life when
he was almost gone. I do not think that Humming Birds in good health
and able to buzz about would need a temperature above 70 degrees.
They are undoubtedly most intelligent, and when my small mite was
on the floor of the cage and found any difficulty in perching, he soon
seemed to understand when I held a twig in front of him, and would
" climb " on to it, permitting me to convey him to a fixed one in the

throat of scintillating green ; the wings and tail black, the latter forked.
It is hateful and horrible to lose such a rarity, whose like one may
never see again. When I looked at the tiny body I could not but
sigh and say : " Why was he ever taken from his Venezuelan forest

Professor A. A. Allen, of Cornell University, recently published in
Scribners Magazine an instructive and entertaining account of the
nesting of Humming Birds. An epitome of this may perhaps interest
members of the Society, and form a fitting sequel to Mr. Astley's
article. 1
By good fortune, it appears, a female of one of these feathered
jewels elected to nest in a pear-tree ha a back yard in America, the
choice of site affording the opportunity to keep her and her doings under
observation. During the days of courtship the male was much in
evidence, rocketing back and forth, with throat ablaze aiad wings
humming before the female demurely perched on some dead twig.
But with the laying of the first egg, his interest in the proceedings
ceased, and off he went to a bachelor life, leaving to the female the sole
charge of the family. The making of the entire nest was also left to the
energies of the prospective laiother. The nest, made of cotton and coated
outside with bits of bark and lichen to make it look like a mere
excrescence on the branch to which it was fasteiaed by means of cob-
webs, was no bigger than a walnut. Two tiny white eggs were laid in
it on consecutive days soon after it was finished. She tended them
assiduously, turning them with her probe-like bill, and only leaving
them for short periods to catch the insects necessary for her own
sustenance. She was absolutely without fear of human beings, and
would allow anyone to stroke her as she sat or remove her from the
nest, even perching confidingly and without resentmeiat upon the finger
of the hand that disturbed her. The period of incubation was exactly
fifteen days for each egg ; and the naked atoms that emerged, no larger

than honey-bees, had short, stubby bills, quite unlike those of their
parents. She fed them from her own crop on nectar and the tiny
insects it contained, at first inserting the food into their mouths by
means of her tongue, but later on thrusting her bill down their throats
and injecting them with the fluid drop by drop by means of a kind of
pumping action. Their crops, when distended, were nearly as large
as their heads, and the skin was so tightly stretched as to become
sufficiently transparent to show the insects still alive and kicking
in the nectar. In less than a week there was a noticeable difference in
the length of their bills, and feathers began to appear on their backs.
During the second week they became fully feathered, and before the
end of the third they had outgrown the nest and flattened it out of
shape. Three weeks after the first egg hatched, the larger of the two
nestlings, who had been trying his wings for several days, rose into the
air, and mounting up and up ultimately settled on a twig near the top
of the tree. The mother was away food-hunting at the time ; but on
her return she did not evince the least anxiety or dismay at the absence
of one of the twins. After feeding the one that had stayed at home,
she uttered a few squeaks, and in response to the answering squeaks
of the fledgling up aloft, flew straight to him, perched alongside, and
proceeded to stuff him with nectar as she had previously done. The
next day the second nestling similarly took wing, but not having
sufficient strength to ascend to the lofty position taken up by the first,
flew across the yard and ultimately settled on a tiny twig. There he
remained until later in the day, when he made a fresh effort, and aided
by his increased strength succeeded in joining his companion in the top
of the pear-tree. With this record of the first days of their life out of
the nest the story closes.

only been opened a few days and things were not quite in order, so
Mr. Chapman told me, I noticed that every cage was clean and there
was none of that musty smell that is generally present hi bird-shops.
Mr. Chapman also had a splendid show of birds. Amazons of many
species, including the White-browed and Red-browed, a pair of the rare
Yellow-thighed Caiques, nearly a hundred Bauer's Parrakeets, Pennants,
and Cockatiels. There were two pairs of the rare Montezuma Quail,
and other rare Mexican birds of which the Zoological Society secured a
Wagler's Hangnest and a Chestnut-capped Buarremon. There was also
a large stock of Australian Finches and Budgerigars.
Waterfowl at Dereham. -- Mr. Wormold has done well with his
waterfowl this season, and writes that he has reared about three
hundred ducklings. His greatest triumph has been the hatching of two
strong Canvas-backed Ducks from eggs sent from Canada in a sealed-
up tin box !
The Ornate Tanager. -- The Duchess of Wellington is to be heartily
congratulated upon breeding in her aviaries at Ewhurst Park the
beautiful Blue Tanager, Tanagra ornata. I hear that the young birds
are out of the nest and feeding themselves, and their parents are
building a second nest. There has been a good deal of confusion over
the English names of the Tanagers of the genus Tanagra. T. ornata
has been called the "Archbishop Tanager", a name that should be
confined to T. episcopus. The best name for T. ornata would surely
be " Ornate Tanager ". It is easily distinguished from most of its
allies by the yellow edges to the lesser wing-coverts.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos. -- For the second year in succession the
pair of Leadbeater's Cockatoos in the outside aviary at the Parrot
House at the Zoological Gardens have reared two young birds, which
left the nest when from four to five weeks old, when they appeared to
be nearly as large as their parents. Of all the Cockatoos the Lead-
beater is the easiest to breed in captivity, besides being the most
handsome.
Sacred Ibises. -- In the Great Aviary the Sacred Ibises have again
bred, rearing two young birds as they did last year, but, whereas on the
last occasion the two young were hatched in the same nest, this year
there were two nests, the two pairs of birds building side-by-side,

BIRDS OF PARADISE ON LITTLE TOBAGO

<bodyText confidence="0.993907217391304" page_id="32671006"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
It is, I understand, a fact that Sir William Ingram has sold the
island of Little Tobago (West Indies) to Mr. A. Luban, of Newark,
New Jersey, who is very interested in the Lesser Birds of Paradise,
which Sir William imported several years ago from New Guinea.
It is reported that Mr. Luban has an idea of building a huge aviary
on the island, where some of the birds could be confined for the purpose
of studying their habits. During the last five or six years the birds
have increased largely in numbers, which greatly reduces their chances
of extermination. A number of papaw-trees were planted with the
object of providing fruits for them, and these are greatly appreciated.
Mr. Beebe visited the island not long ago, and was very satisfied with
the result. He reported that owing to the scarcity of water, pots holding
about a gallon have been placed about 35 feet up in three of the most
conspicuous trees in the area where fruit is most abundant, and water
is supplied twice a month. As many as fifteen Birds of Paradise have
been observed at one time in the top of a favourite tree.
It is to be hoped that Mr. Luban will be as successful in his care of
these birds as was Sir William Ingram, and will perhaps be able to
import other species of the Paradiseidge. Kagus might also be turned
down, and other birds which are in danger of extinction. One wonders
that some of the Birds of Paradise on Little Tobago have never found
their way over the 2 mile crossing to Tobago.

Not a bad list for 5 miles west of Hyde Park Corner. But the
Nightingale dates from about forty years ago, and was found by my
brother. Our garden was about eleven acres in all and part of it belonged
to the garden of Corney House, pulled down in 1832. That part was
allowed to run wild, and had a river frontage. It was a paradise for
natural history ; but that is a thing of the past. The list would be
longer but for my youth and ignorance during the best and earlier years.
During the winter of 1912 our gardener found in the garden a young
cock Blackbird which seemed to have been badly scared by a cat,
just escaping with its life. I gave the man a cage, which he hung up
in a shed, and by the spring the bird had recovered except for a slightly
dropping wing. It was then released. Now, whenever there is a
shortage of food or hard weather, that bird voluntarily returns to the
cage, where the gardener keeps it until better weather comes, shutting
the cage-door to protect it from cats. I saw it there myself last winter,
and have seen it in the garden once this summer. It must, therefore,
be 10 years old. It seems to appreciate what was done for it during times
of distress.

GAME BIRDS WITH YOUNG: DIFFERENT ACTION OF
PARENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99516847826087" page_id="32671008"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- Scenes in which Partridges of the genus Perdix defend their
young when the latter are in danger are, I believe it correct to say,
by no means of rare occurrence.
But recently a scene occurred here in North Kent where the action
of the parents was very different, one defending the young, the other
fleeing ; and therefore I thought some account might interest one or
other of our members who are breeding the spur-legged allies known
as Francolins ( Francolinus genus), or have kept them in past years, or
the Tree Partridges ( Arhoricola genus), which latter are placed one
on each side of the Partridges (referred to chiefly in these remarks)
by our member, Mr. Ogilive Grant, in the account of game birds in
Royal Natural History (see vol. iv, pp. 411 to 413).
On 10th June this year I was standing among some apple-trees on
my land, &apos;and heard a considerable noise being made by excited
Partridges on a neighbour's land, which was then growing a scanty
hay crop, there being a thorn hedge between me and the Partridges.
Plaving a stick in hand, I proceeded towards the hedge to see what
was happening, during which time the shrieks of Partridges increased ;
and when a few yards away from the hedge a single Partridge dashed
over it in my direction, squalling loudly in evidently considerable
excitement--it obviously not seeing me until it had flown over the
hedge. On my reaching the hedge and looking over to where the
excitement began, there I saw a dog and the other parent Partridge

carrying out a series of flying attacks round its head, while the brood
of young birds were hurrying away as quick as their little legs could
carry them into a safer place. This assault it continued, flying round
the dog at about the level of its head (it was a sheep-dog), until it
apparently considered its young were at a safe distance, and when the
dog, being vociferously cursed and abused by me, began to retreat,
it then joined its young some yards away.
As afore-stated, the action of the two parent Partridges was, when
seen by me, very different--the one retreating in flight from the scene
of danger to its young ones, the other vigorously attacking and counter-
attacking the offending dog. Personally, I should think the latter was
more likely to be the female. It would be of interest to hear from other
members who keep either the Francolins or the&apos;Tree Partridges, or
any birds more or less allied to our British Partridge, how they have
behaved when their young were threatened with danger -- more
especially as to whether there was any difference of behaviour in the
parent birds ?

BRITISH BIRDS IN AUSTRALIA

Sirs, --It is interesting to realize how numerous some British birds
are in Victoria and different parts of Southern Australia; they are-rapidly
increasing in every way. Take, for instance, the ordinary English
Sparrow ; it is found everywhere now in Southern Australia, and is
also working its way over to Western Australia. Take also the English
Starling ; in Victoria we have them in thousands, and largely in our
Zoo, the same in South Australia, and they have now found their
way to New South Wales and Southern Queensland. There is a great
deal of trouble with regard to them, as they are keen on fruit, and as so
many orchards exist here they naturally cause a good deal of bother,
various means being used to destroy them. Then, again, Blackbirds
are also getting plentiful, especially in parts of Victoria ; they are
remarkably tame, but one does not hear many complaints regarding
them. A few Thrushes are also found here, but they do not increase
in the same way as Blackbirds do ; they are also found in the more

thickly timbered country. Goldfinches are also numerous ; they are
increasing fast, especially in the more open country. Their discarded
nests are often seen in the branches when the leaves are off the imported
trees. Green Linnets, too, we have a fair number of, and they are often
seen. Skylarks are also frequently seen and heard ; they naturally
keep to the plain country. The other birds referred to have probably
been here now for forty odd years. Some of the birds found here are
imported from other countries ; take, &apos;for instance, the Indian Minah,
which is usually found in well-inhabited districts, especially near the
large cities. Then, again, take the Doves from Java ; like all Doves,
they are, practically speaking, harmless, anyhow as far as fruit is
concerned, but they are very plentiful in Victoria. A few are found in
New South Wales, but they have not got anything like the hold in
any part of Southern Australia that the other birds have. Sparrows
are probably by a long way the most numerous, being found more or
less about the cities.

{Continued from p. 116.)
Fifty kilometres to the west of Caracas, along the high valley and
across some defiles, is the large village of Guarenas, calcined in the
midst of arid mountains. Poor market-town though it be, there are
nevertheless birds in it everywhere. (Tackles, called " blackbirds "
throughout tropical America, are abundant in the farmyards.
A dozen kilometres to the north of Guarenas lies Curupao, the home
of one of my fellow-countrymen, M. Bickhardt, who kindly allowed me
to stay on his estate, and put at my disposal everything I needed.
Curupao is an ideal spot for studying the birds typical of the northern
mountainous part of Venezuela. Its area, over 50,000 acres in extent,
contains all one can wish for -- -a valley, mountains, here covered with
woods and grass, there with bush and coffee plantations, and preserving
on their summits the reduced remains of the primitive virgin forest
which formerly overspread this part of Venezuela.
The cattle-farm, or " coral," where I live, is full of birds. Every
nook is occupied by those already mentioned. Tyrants of different
kinds dwell in the roofs, Grackles and Anis in the shelters ; the long
herbage affords a home for the species of Spermophila and Saffron,
Jacarini, and other Finches. The low, thick acacias, sprouting along
the edges of the buildings, are always enlivened with the voices of
Tanagers of all sorts, of Wrens and of Troupials. Every day a pair
of giant Cassiques take advantage of the presence of three orange-trees
at my door to gorge themselves xvitb fruit during the noon siesta, and
everywhere may be heard the strange, sharp cries of Humming-birds,

which are eternally quarrelling and fighting and attempting to put to
flight any bird of their own kind that comes into view.
Along the streams, in the low trees, marvels of bird-life may be seen ;
here a Jacamar, with long pointed beak, back and wings of shining
golden green and belly red, waits, immovable upon a twig, for insects.
Peculiar cries, like a sharp, clucking " ton-ton-ton-ton," make me raise
my head. They proceed from Trogons, green like the Jacamars, but
with breast and belly beautifully tinted with pink.
Farther away are various Cuckoos, grey or rufous birds, the size of
a Blackbird or Magpie. Beautiful banded, red-crowned Woodpeckers
tap the trees, to which also cling in similar fashion the curious brown
Dendrocolaptes , with their long, curved beaks.
A large solitary tree is alive with yellow-backed, chattering
Cassiques and with troops of Sugarbirds, of the genus Dacnis and of
Calliste Tanagers. Delightful hours may be spent in the contemplation
of all these feathered jewels, which show no shyness so long as one keeps
still. Seated upon a stone, with the clear stream bubbling round me,
I look through my field glass and see Humming-birds, Phcetornis or
Agytria, flying fearlessly a few inches from my face and perching to
preen their plumage within reach of my hand. Then piercing cries
are heard, and a flock of Parrakeets, brown-throated Conures, the
Guiana parrotlets, pass in rapid flight, giving the impression of
leaves driven hither and thither by a tempest.
High up at an altitude of about 1,500 metres are coffee and other
plantations touching the forest, the " Montagne," as it is called by the
half-caste Spanish-Indian Peons. Thither I sometimes climb to meet
with different species of birds, although Tanagers, Troupials, Trogons,
and other frequenters of the valley are still in evidence. The lovely
green Jays, Xanthura coendeocephala, blue-headed and yellow-bellied,
come down in troops from the summit of the high trees to settle
on the coffee-plants and mob our dogs with their cries. Large Pigeons,
Geotrygon, Leptoptila , and Colwnba, are abundant, whereas lower down
only little ground Doves are to be found.
The path winds between low plantations of cassava, beans, and
bananas, with here and there leafless trees. What is this flock of
Parrakeets that wheel and approach us ? They settle on a dead tree

twenty metres from our party. Without moving and unwearied, we
give ourselves up to the admiration of these superb birds, which prove
to be examples of Pyrrhura hcematotis, coloured green, dark red, and
pale blue.
On reaching the forest, we find its margin so dense that nothing can
be seen. Outside it is dry and warm. We force our way a few yards
within, and find everything changed. The air is damp and almost
fresh. Delicate palms, ferns of all kinds, and arums, deck the under-
wood with delicate verdure ; on the trees, comparable in size to our
own, but throwing a deeper shade, flourish orchids and bromelias.
Cascades fall through the underwood ; the damp and gloom increase all
round us ; the ferns become more delicate and even translucent; and
the growth of vegetation is splendid. Beyond this entire acres are
covered with a single species of palm, a kind of Eterpe, with its
clustering trunks, smooth and annulated, crowned at the summit with
enormous flexible leaves ; and these, when fallen and dry, carpet the
ground beneath. Throughout this noiseless forest, not an insect and
scarcely a bird is to be seen. Near the edge a large banded Wren
has followed us with its sweet and musical song, and a little distance
away we surprise a troop of small green Toucans, Aulacorhamphus
sulcatus. Here and there, near the ground, may, be noticed small grey
Ant-thrushes, and from tree to tree flit a few Tanagers, the wonderful
Compsocoma sumptuosa, black and blue above, clear yellow below.
That is all I see. Doubtless, the forest shelters numbers of Curassows,
Guans, Tinamous, large Accipitres, as well as other birds ; but it
conceals them with care, as it conceals the Jaguars, Pumas, and Tapirs,
whose tracks we see on all sides.

When I arrived in South Australia in January, 1885, the above
Parrakeet was extremely numerous in the immediate suburbs of
Adelaide. I remember seeing flocks of thirty or more in a flock at
Hectorville, about 5 miles from the centre of the city. The birds were

always to be found in the large Red Gums ( Eucalyptus rostratus), which
grew and still grows along the watercourses that come down from the
hills and flow into the River Torrens. Throughout the Adelaide hills
during the years 1885-7 these birds were in great numbers. At
Mt. Barker during those years I sometimes saw the limbs of lofty dead
Gum-trees almost bristling with these birds. Anywhere throughout
that district, only 23 miles from Adelaide, in the morning and evening,
flocks of hcematonotus were feeding in the grass paddocks, the bright
plumage of the males (red, yellow, blue, and green) lending a charm to
the landscape all its own.
I left for England in 1887 and returned in January, 1888. On
my return I found that a sad fatality had befallen these beautiful birds.
Through the attack of some disease the birds of this species had lost
the power to regain their feathers after the annual moult, and swarms
of naked but otherwise healthy and vigorous birds were everywhere
running about in the long, dry grass absolutely destitute of feathers.
I caught several of them, but they showed themselves such adepts at
the use of their bills on one's fingers that one was glad to leave them
alone. They were feeding on grass seeds and the seeds of other prostrate
plants, and appeared, as before stated, quite healthy otherwise. Next
spring there were none to be seen. Whether their extinction was due
to predacious animals, cats, etc., or only due to the cold of the winter,
I do not knoAv. I am inclined to think that the latter was the most
potent factor. From that year, 1888, till the present, 1922, I haAm not
seen any of these birds in their old haunts at Hectorville, though the
large timber still remains. In the Adelaide hills they disappeared
altogether for at least ten years, and after that on one or two occasions
I observed an odd pair or so. After the lapse of more than thirty years
they have become fairly common, but probably even now there is
barely a tenth of the number there used to be prior to the epidemic
of 1888.
I am unable to determine the area affected, but I should think it
quite safe to estimate that it would equal at least 100 miles in diameter.
During the period when they were quite absent from the Adelaide
district I saw a fairly large flock near Ballarat in Victoria, say 600 miles
aAvay. And about five years ago when visiting about 200 miles north

fore judged that the epidemic of 1888 coidd not have as completely
exterminated the species there as was the case further south.
The above notes by my friend Mr. Ashby, an experienced field
ornithologist, are very interesting to me, because I recollect that about
the year 1889 I purchased several Redrumps, all of which were suffering
more or less from the complaint known as "French moult - '. The
birds were flightless and to a great extent devoid of feathers. Most of
them died, but if I remember rightly a few recovered. One put it
down in those days to some fault in treatment either on the voyage
or after, but it now transpires that this was a disease which attacked
the wild birds, and there is little doubt that they were captured in this
condition.
This is evidently one of those strange methods adopted by Nature
to avoid over population in any particular species. Here we have a bird
that for some unaccountable reason had become excessively numerous
in a certain district; probably so numerous that the food supply was
insufficient. This strange malady suddenly appears and almost wipes
them out, although one is glad to know that the species has to a great
extent recovered again.

We landed in New York after being delayed one day in a fog off
the Banks of Newfoundland. Our first day in U.S.A. (30th March) my
son and I spent at the Zoological Park.
The Zoological Park is the geographical centre of that portion of
greater New York known as Bronx County. From east to west it is
halfway between the Hudson River and Long Island Sound, and from
north to south it is mid-way between the mouth of the Harlem River
and Mount Vernon. (From the City Hall the distance is 11 miles.)
There are plenty of means of access, and the charge for the whole
distance is a nickel (2 \d.) ; we rode 15 miles for that amount.

134 J. B. Housden--Visit to Neiv York Zoological Park
The admission is free, except Monday and Thursday, when the
admission is fifteen cents. It was a very wet day, and being a pay day,
we were almost the only visitors. The area of the Park is 264 acres ;
the crowning glory of the Zoological Park is the magnificent forest
growth of some forty species of trees and shrubs, which covers, thickly
or sparsely, about two-thirds of its land area. Over seventy species of
wild birds nest in the Park. There are six entrances to the Park, the
extreme length from north to south is just under one mile, its extreme
width three-fifths of a mile.
We saw our first native birds, a large flock of Purple Grackles and
a number of Downy Woodpeckers. We called at the office of Captain
C. William Beebe, our Fellow-Member, and the curator of ornithology,
and found he was away in the south.
The first building we visited in the Park was " The Small Mammal
House." Here, in the 176 cages in and around this building, the visitor
finds a large collection of animals, chiefly small mammals. On the
whole, the most striking animals in the Small Mammal House are three
beautiful Albino Racoons, from Illinois ; also an Albino Woodchuck and
Opossum.
We noticed in this and other buildings the following notice :--
" Hands off, warning, $3 fine for feeding any of the animals."
The Mammoth Flying Cage, one of the wonders of the Zoological
Park, was empty. This cage is the summer home of a mixed flock of
large and showy water birds ; all these birds are located during the
winter in " The Aquatic Bird House." This building (as the official
guide informs the visitor) is the result of an attempt to solve an old
problem in a new way--the care of large migratory water birds in the
most uneven winter climate on earth. A large collection of Flamingoes,
large Herons, Egrets, Ibises, and other large birds, all in splendid plumage
were in this crowded house. (I hope to pay another visit on my return
in July to New York, and see all these birds in their summer quarters.)
We next visited the " Large Bird House," a very handsome
building, and, we believe, the largest home for perching birds in
existence.
Here I met and renewed my acquaintance with the head keeper (the
last time we had met was twenty years ago in our own Zoological

Gardens in London). He was most courteous, and showed us all his
magnificent collection of birds. We spent some hours in this house.
The large bird house is an L-shaped building, with an all-glass house
in its angle. The main hall extends east and west, and is 60 feet
long by 50 feet wide. This great room contains the foreign song-birds,
many tropical Doves and Pigeons, several kinds of rare Fruit Pigeons
(one pair most lovely birds, marked Lilac-shouldered Fruit Pigeon ; and
some beautiful New Guinea Pittas); also, Great Crowned Pigeons,
Tinamous, Toucans, Hornbills, and Giant Kingfishers. In the great
central flying cage is a remarkable gathering of small tropical birds---
swimmers, waders, game, and perching birds.
The flying cage in the centre of the main hall contains a pool of
running water, some small trees, rocks, and sand. Hopping and flying
about, and perching on the trees is a remarkable medley of birds.
There are Wood and Mandarin Ducks, Black Skimmers, Terns, several
species of Teal, Curlews, Gallinules, Coots, Lapwings, Snipe, Ruffs,
Quail, many kind of Pigeon and Doves, Orioles, Cardinals, Wood-
peckers, various kinds of Weavers, and Sparrows.
The south side of the main hall is devoted to various large rare birds
from the tropics, all in large cages.
On the northern side is a very interesting group of birds from Cuba
and the Bahamas, a good collection of Weavers, Finches, Trogons, and
others. Here also are rare and beautifully plumed Birds of Paradise
(Count Raggi), and the Blue Bird of Paradise, Prince Rudolf, and the
Greater Bird of Paradise.
In the " Official Guide " we read : " In the glass court and around
it, the Curator of Birds, Mr. C. William Beebe, has scored a gratifying
success in the installation of the order Passeres. The birds are
arranged by families, and all of the twenty-one families of Eastern
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.596296">
North American perching birds are represented. These families are
Waxwings, Shrikes, Flycatchers, Wrens, Mocking Birds, Catbirds,
Thrushes, Ringlets, Nuthatches, Brown Creepers, Warblers, Pipits,
Larks, Tanagers, Orioles, Crows, Jays, and others." A very fine
collection and well arranged.
A large circular flying cage, at the outer corner of the glass court,
is filled with Robins, Bluebirds, Thrushes (various), and Woodpeckers.

Along the western side of the large bird house (outside), fourteen
large cages are filled with members of the Crow and Blackbird families
(Corvidce and Icteridce), quite a large number of Ravens and Crows,
several different species of Jays and Magpies ; Meadow Larks, Cow-
birds, Grackles, and Red-headed Woodpeckers.
Of this splendid collection, there were two birds certainly that the
writer coveted (although I have stuffed specimens, I have not seen
a living specimen for many years), one a beautiful male of the nearly
extinct Australian Turquoisine Parrakeet (Neojjhema pulcliella), the
other a male cock of the Rock (Rupicola crocea). This bird has moidted
twice, but its plumage is quite as bright as a newly caught specimen.
Our first visit to the New York Zoological Park was certainly a very
enjoyable one.

Our hatching results in some cases were lamentable, notably in the
case of Mandarins and American Wigeon. However, we have a scheme
by which we hope to rectify this next season. A large number of "clear "
white call ducks' eggs were laid, and this was to be explained by the
fact that she had no drake at the beginning of her laying--my man
having sent away her husband by mistake and she had not paired to
the other drake which lived with them in time for the first ten eggs to
be fertile.
The mortality in young common Pochards was much too high. As
a rule, these are very easy ducklings to rear, but several died when
quite small. For the last two seasons we have had about four or five
young Pochards hatched with pink bills and very pale legs, and the
whole colouring rather paler than in the normal bird--more the colour
of Red-crested Pochard ducklings. In every case, these light-coloured
birds, when about two days old, appear to go " dotty ! " They fall
about, cannot run straight, and keep twisting their heads round, and
invariably die within a week. I should be interested to know if any-
body else has come across this unpleasant variety ?

Hugh Wormald--The Season&apos;s Duck Breeding at E. Dereham 137
The large number of birds we found deal in the shell calls for
some notice. As a rule we like to set our eggs so that about forty of
different varieties should hatch at the same time. Then by mixing
up the young of different sorts before cooping them out, one does away
&quot;with the danger of a hen killing ducklings of another brood if they get
into her coop--since if each hen (I like to have two or three broods of
the same age in one enclosure) has, say, three or four Gadwall, Shoveler,
Falcated, and Carolina, they cannot tell their own foster children from
those of the next coop. This year it so happened that the day before
we expected our three largest hatchings (forty to seventy eggs) to come
off, we had a bad thunderstorm. In our experience, thunder invariably
causes many ducklings to die in the shell, either just before or after
chipping. We presume this mortality is caused by the electricity in
the air. On the whole, we are well satisfied with the season's results.
May could not have been a better month for young ducks, but since the
middle of June we have had the worst possible weather, cold and wet
almost every day, and it was very difficult to keep quite small ducklings
alive. But now (27th&apos; July) all the ducklings&apos; should be safe--bar
accidents. Some are already moulting from their first plumage into
full winter plumage. This has been an extremely good laying season,
the fifty-two ducks which laid eggs averaging rather better than 12-5
eggs each. Four laid only seven, one six, and one nine eggs, but these
were counteracted by most of the others laying two clutches each ;
indeed, the Spotbill, one Shoveler, and one American Wigeon laid three
clutches each.
We were lucky in losing very few eggs from vermin. To our know-
ledge the only losses from this cause were two Yellow-billed eggs, one
Pochard, two Tufted, and a full clutch of Chestnut-breasted Teal,
whose nest we had not found, but the duck had just begun to sit. All
these losses, except one egg, were by water-voles, as proved by a few
strychnined eggs in the robbed nests. The exception was a large female
common rat suckling a litter. She only got about 3 feet from the
nest after her second visit.
Perhaps the most important event of all occurred towards the end

to be batched in this country. This was an experiment, from which we
had little hope of success. American postal authorities refuse to accept
eggs unless packed in absolutely air-tight tin boxes, so that these eleven
eggs had twenty days shaking in soldered-up tins ; but in spite of
this seven out of the eleven proved fertile, though only two hatched.
These are, we think, the strongest ducklings we have hatched this year.
At present they are feeding well, but are extremely shy. It is too much
to hope, should we succeed in rearing them, that they will prove a pair.

THE DISPLAY OF THE KINO BIRD OF PARADISE

The remarkable displays of some of the Birds of Paradise have
often been described in this and other publications, but I think a form
of display that I observed in the Small Bird House of the Zoological
Society in Regent's Park a few days ago is specially worth recording.
In one of the large central cages, in which are kept a considerable
number of birds of various species, is an immature male King Bird of
Paradise. It may possibly be a female, as female birds of many species
will display under certain circumstances, vide the peahen and even the
peachick ! This young bird went through various forms of display
to one bird after the other, but it had nothing to " show off " with,
being a particularly sombre brown bird of various shades. However,
in common with very many kindred species of its genus, it had a brilliant
and beautiful apple-green toning to its mouth and throat, and this it
displayed to the full, opening its mouth widely to show as much as
possible of its throat to each bird it visited as soon as it bad finished
its display. This appears to me extraordinary. How did this young
bird know that its one beauty spot was inside its mouth ? As usual,
none of the birds which it took so much trouble to show itself to took
the slightest notice of it.

Small Bird House at the Zoological Gardens, has recently completed
its moult and is now in quite perfect plumage, and I have on several
occasions lately witnessed its display, which is entirely different to
that of any other Paradise Bird with which I am acquainted. This is
a bird of many colours, but the most conspicuous features of its plumage
are the breast shield of rich green and the fan-shaped shield of pale
straw-coloured feathers which grows from the hind neck and normally
lies on the back. The features of this shield are peculiar in that they
appear as though composed of finely spun glass, which in certain lights
looks almost like silver.

When the bird displays it suddenly assumes an erect position,
lowers the pectoral shield until it appears to rest on its feet, at the same
time throwing into a vertical position the shield of straw-coloured
plumes of the nape. The pectoral shield is composed of soft velvety
feathers of a bright green, the lower portion of which is edged with
brilliant metallic blue, and down the centre of which runs a band of
metallic blue feathers edged with green. During display this shield
covers the whole bird from the head downwards, being met at its
upper edges by the lower edges of the erected shield from the nape,
the attitude then assumed being that which I have attempted to
represent in the accompanying illustration.

the last one on 12th August; but she will not sit, probably owing to the
smallness of the aviary and want of cover. The eggs are generally laid
on alternate days at about noon.
Failing to get a bantam, I placed them under a hen, although
fearing she would trample them to. death. This actually happened.
She did her best but could not avoid treading on thirteen little black
beetles. Only two eggs proved clear. She was given three hens' eggs,
in case she refused to sit on such small eggs, as well as sixteen quails'
eggs. One of the latter I broke a few days before they were due to
hatch, in order to find out if it was worth making a run for the chicks
and getting ants' eggs to feed them on.
The first eggs of those placed under the hen were laid on 24th June,
the last on 17th July. The hen started to sit at 10 a.nr. 18th July. Some
eggs chipped 10 a.nr. 5th August, and a few chicks hatched out at
1.15 p.m. on the same day, and the last at 7 a.nr. the following day.
The length of incubation was eighteen days and several hours.
The first nest consisted of a few straws collected round a slight
hollow scraped in the ground under a bush ; a second was made in
a tuft of coarse grass.
The eggs, measuring one inch two lines by eleven lines, were bluntly
pointed at the small end, cream in colour, and thickly spotted with
small specks of dark brown.

I am glad to have three more birds to add to the number in our
garden, mentioned in the April number of the Avicultural Magazine,
to wit, the Great Spotted Woodpecker, the Willow-warbler, and a noisy
Jay, who haunts the place and seems inclined to stay. The Wood-
pecker was tapping so busily on an apple-tree close to the gardener's
cottage, that it took no notice of a child patting on the window opposite,
but continued its tapping, then flew off quietly into a hedge of old
hawthorns and elder. The Willow-wren, singing charmingly among
some nut-trees, was detected by an ornithologist friend, who was
searching for nests in the orchard. The Spotted Flycatcher, mentioned
in my April number account of our birds as having for years nested on
the bough of an old cedar, has now built in an old nest in the rustic
oak porch of the said gardener's cottage, and has hatched its young.
It was so fearless that a little child lifted up to the nest could touch
the sitting hen bird. Two young were hatched, one now flown, but
the other died in the nest, the mother-bird having been frightened awav
by a stranger entering the porch and remaining there for some time.
A wild Turtle Dove has come to stay it seems, and actually enters the
verandah, where it fights in the air almost every evening with a Barbary
Dove over the acquisition of the food put out for the latter. There
is now a nest of Barbary Doves in the verandah, and two young
were hatched in July. It was absurd to see the parents guarding the
verandah as if it were their own, and the cock attacking the wild Turtles
which come to feed without any aggressive designs, I feel sure, on the
precious nest.

One pair of Bullfinches nested for some weeks in a little basket in
their cage, laying eggs and tossing them out again. The hen scornfully
tears out all the nesting stuff I put in the basket for her, and dragged
up tufts of grass which she pulled up by the roots to the basket to make
her nest. She does not mind anyone looking at her as she builds and
lays. The cock sings to her all day long. I never had Bullfinches
quite so tame, for I can let them out singly or together to fly about
the garden, and they come back at my call.

Sirs, --In your article on the " Ways of Eagles " on page 93 of the
present volume of the Avicidtural Magazine, you say : " I believe
it is the common impression -- it certainly was mine--that Eagles as
a class are, ior the most part, independent hunters, disdaining piratical
methods of picking up a livelihood." In that case, it will interest most
members to know that the reverse is the case, with a very few honourable
exceptions. Of the true Indian Eagles, the only regular hunter is the
Golden Eagle ( Aquila chryscetus). The Imperial (A. heliaca), the
Steppe (A. bifasciola), the Spotted (A. macidata), and the Tawny*
(A. vindhiana ), etc., are all pirates and scavengers. I do not mean to

infer by this that they never bunt, as this depends a great deal on
environment and opportunity. I have seen the Imperial bunting bares
and tbe others frequently catcb rats, toads, lizards, and even bigger
game occasionally, but robbery and scavenging are tbeir chief pursuits,
and one has not to remain long in any of tbe stations of India to witness
a crow being pursued by, and having to give up its titbit to a Tawny
Eagle and so on.
Tbe Hawk Eagles are nearly all hunters. All tbe species of
Spizaetus and also Bonelli's Eagle ( Eutolmaetus fasciatus), and the
Rufous-bellied Hawk Eagle ( Lophotriorchis kieneri) are not, as a rule,
given to piracy, but catcb tbeir own dinner.
On tbe other band, it can safely be said that, given tbe opportunity 5
every bird of prey is a pirate to a more or less extent.
Even tbe noble Peregrine does not disdain purloining another
falcon's catcb. A very common method of catching Peregrines, and in
fact all or any of the Raptores, is by means of a decoy. A ball of
feathers, intermixed with a number of fine horse-hair nooses, is tied
to another Falcon's feet. Three or four of the flight feathers are tied
together to prevent the bird flying away altogether, and the decoy
is then thrown up into the air in some open plain or near the banks of
some river which the Peregrine is known to frequent. If she happens
to be within seeing distance she cannot resist such an opportunity,
i.e. seeing another Falcon carrying off what looks like a small bird,
and before the decoy has reached the ground, as it will within two or
three hundred yards, the Peregrine has caught up and " bound " to
tbe ball of feathers, and incidentally to the nooses. A little pulling and
straining to get the titbit away and the nooses have done the rest.
You can then run up and catch tbe wild Falcon, as well as your decoy,
as the one cannot carry off the other.
It sometimes happens that some marauding Eagle sees the decoy,
x n which case, unless you can run fast enough and shout loud enough
to drive him- away, you will see the last of your decoy.
I have discovered from long experience that a bird of prey which has
become suspicious and will not attack a bird, such as a Quail or a
Pigeon, behind a net, will forget all about its suspicions and come down
without hesitation the moment you substitute another and a smaller

bird of prey, with meat or feathers in its claws, for the Quail or
Pigeon. This particularly applies to Eagles, who seem incapable of
resisting an attack on something smaller, with food in its talons.
From the last line, page 93 and the first half a dozen lines of page 94,
it would appear that the Tiercel is the female. This, of course, is not
the case. Amongst the birds of prey, generally (with some very
few exceptions) the female is very much bigger than the male, and hence
the name tiercel--from tierce, a third--is applied to the male of a
falcon, i.e. a third the size.

Sirs, --I have succeeded in hatching two Lesser Sulphur-crested
Cockatoos. The male did most of the incubating. I thought this
might interest you, as I do not suppose it is of frequent occurrence.
The nest is a very stout square box hung on a wire 14 feet from the
ground. I intend to try my luck with C. roseicapillus $ and
C. leculbeateri ?.

By the Duchess of Wellington
Our Editors have asked for an. account of aviary work here, and
I am well pleased to give it, for the fates have been kind and have
granted me several successes this season. My aviaries were altered
and remodelled last autumn by the advice of Mr. Astley, who was
kind enough to give me the benefit of his great experience. The long
passage aviaries are now divided into compartments, each with its
boarded shelter and naturally planted flight, so that there is accommoda-
tion for more birds with less danger of quarrelling.
They contain the following birds : A pair of Indigo Buntings, now
rearing young in their fourth nest. Poor little birds ! ill-luck has
continually pursued them. At first they were in the big aviary where
they throve and nested, and all went well until the Pekin Robins
sucked their eggs. This happened again and again until I caught up
the Buntings and gave them a home in this small aviary, where they
have things all their own way.
Next door to them is a mixed lot of Lavender Finches, Nonpareil
Buntings, St. Helena Waxbills, Cuban Finches, Cordon Bleus, Blue
Waxbills, and a Long-tailed Grass Finch, all in the pink of condition
and plumage except the Nonpareil, who is moulting heavily. Beyond
them, in a compartment to themselves, are a true pair of American
Robins, also heavily in moult, but fine, vigorous birds, which look like
breeding next year. Beyond, again, is a mixed lot of Zebra Finches,
Weavers, and quarrelsome little Queen Whydahs. The Zebras have
reared several families and are always cheerful, contented, and noisy.

These compartments run alongside of, and open into, a large aviary
known as "St. Francis," from a figure of the saint which stands in it, and
it is in this aviary that the event of the year took place. About half-
way down the aviary are two ornamental china stands with pierced
sides about 2 feet high (see Plate), and inside one (marked in the
Plate with a cross) my Ornate Tanagers (Tanagra ornata) constructed
a neat cup-nest of dried grass and a few small twigs, and successfully
reared two broods of three each. We did not discover the nest until
the young were hatched, and cannot say if both birds shared in the
building and incubation. The young were reared on mealworms and
such insects as the parents could capture, now they feed on milk sop
and fruit; we have found that they much enjoy ripe elder berries, and,
of course, live insects are always welcome. The nest is close to the
door leading into the big aviary and everyone going in or out must pass
within a yard of the sitting bird ; there are more secluded places which
she might have used. She must have gone to nest in May, as it was
June when we found the young. Not content with having reared six
children, this indefatigable bird is sitting again. The three eggs are
rather large, very darkly and heavily splashed and freckled with
brown. She has used the same nest throughout and kept it perfectly
clean. The young resemble their parents except that their colour
is duller and they do not boast yellow in their wings. They appear
to feel cold, and when the nights became frosty we caught them up
and transferred them to the Orangery for the winter, together with
a beautiful pair of Golden-fronted Fruitsuckers which were in
St. Francis aviary with them all the summer. The old Tanagers and
a pair of Masked Doves, which have nearly fledged young in their
nest, will remain out for the present.
Behind is another aviary containing a pair of true Blue Budgerigars
and one of Blue-winged Lovebirds; next door a beautiful cock
Hardwicke's and a White-cheeked Bulbul, both in exhibition plumage,
will spend the winter.
Next we come to the Great Aviary, which I think was mentioned
in the Magazine some time ago. It is a large and lofty wire structure,
with boarded shelters, naturally planted with apple and other trees
and bushes, and flowering plants. A shallow pool in the centre

provides safe bathing places for the birds, and is much frequented by
pairs of Mandarin and Carolina Ducks and other Ducks. The aviary
is enlivened by a flock of Pekin Robins, young birds some of them,
but the nests were so well hidden that they were undetected. Though
these are great sinners with regard to interfering with other birds'
nests, they are so tame and pretty that I cannot find it in my heart
to banish them. Senegal Doves have three fully reared young, which
they drive and persecute incessantly ; these same Doves set on a pair
of Green-winged Doves and destroyed one of them. I think they
really are the most quarrelsome and vicious of the genus, which is
saying much. Giant Whydahs breed freely here, skilfully hiding their
nests among the long grass. The cock is most ornamental during the
summer, with scarlet and yellow on the wing, especially when flying
with his long tail floating behind him.
My greatest success in this aviary was the rearing of three young
hybrid Cardinals, Red-crested + Pope. Has this cross been obtained
before ? They are just getting their red heads, but it is too soon to
say if they will have crests. A pair of Californian Quails made several
attempts at breeding, but deserted their nests every time, probably
disturbed by mice, for it is really impossible to exclude these pests
altogether, though they can be kept down, and are by every means in
our power.
Along one side of this large aviary are four smaller enclosures : one
is empty ; the next contains a blue cock and several blue-bred Green
Budgerigars, from which I hope to breed Blues next year ; the other
compartments each hold a true pair of American Blue Birds (N.B. --\0x25A0
They are not for sale), which were kindly presented to me by the

Along the opposite side a passage aviary contains Canaries,
Goldfinches,-and Green Singing Finches; one end has been cut off
and forms a useful quarantine place.
My Gouldain Finches live across the garden in half of the Orangery ;
they look beautiful, and have certainly two, possibly three, nests.
One enterprising pair took possession of a table drawer, obtaining
entrance through a small hole at the back. The other half of the
Orangery contains the young Tanagers and the Fruitsuckers already
mentioned.

148 J. Delacour -- Notes of a Bird-lover in Tropical America
Nothing pleases me better than sitting quietly among my birds
watching their ways and gaining their confidence. The dullest walks
are made interesting now that I am always looking out for berries,
flowering grass, or insects for them, and they have gained me many
pleasant friends among " birdy " people. Though sometimes an
anxiety they are always a delight, and I am indebted to them for many
happy hours.

[Continued from p. 131.)
The journey down the Rio Portuguesa and the Apure, in a launch,
is wonderful. The river flows between two banks of mouldering clay,
whose height, at this season, of low waters, is about 15 feet. Animal
life, on these rivers, is most plentiful, and this part of the world is
probably one of the best from the ornithological point of view. Not
only birds does one see by thousands, but they belong to especially
attractive groups, and, having been but little disturbed until now,
they are tame and can be watched easily. One wonders that so few
naturalists have been there before.
On the sand banks huge crocodiles are to be seen everywhere, and
also birds. Here, hundreds of Black Vultures and Caracaras feeding
on the carcase of a reptile ; there are also various Egrets and other
Herons, thousands of Terns and Cormorants. On most of the trees
overhanging the Avater Hoatzins are sitting or moving along the
branches, while enormous Iguanas come down to drink. On other trees
families of Red Howler Monkeys watch us fearlessly ; in the north of
Venezuela and Guiana one hears them but seldom gets a glimpse of
them, so Avild and timid are they. Every mile or so along the banks
one sees a pair of Orinoco Geese ; never have I seen them fly or sAA r im,
and only once I noticed three together ; they don't seem to congregate
in flocks.
The low trees on the banks are inhabited by innumerable Ardeidce :

Great and Snowy Egrets, Cocci&apos; Herons, Night Herons, Bitterns of all
kinds ; now and then a fine black Eagle, with yellow bill and white
tail, the Urubitinga, can be seen.
Over our heads hundreds of large birds are soaring : huge American
Adjutants and Tantalus are especially numerous ; Maguari Storks,
Aramus, all sorts of Herons, Scarlet and Glossy Ibises, Roseate Spoon-
bills ; other birds soon join them---Terns, Cormorants, and Snake
Birds ( Anhinga ). Ospreys are fishing around the launch, and it is
a wonderful sight; Macaws and Parrots often cross the river, flying in
pairs ; the Apure, near San Fernando, is over 2 miles wide. This
extraordinary display of tropical life is met with everywhere along
these rivers.
San Fernando is a miserable and unhealthy little town, frightfully
hot. I was there the guest of the Lancashire General Investment
Trust, whose officers were most kind to me and helped in every way.
The comfortable bungalow faces the Apure ; from the windows we
could see enormous Crocodiles and freshwater Dolphins in the water,
and on the sand bank, half a mile distant, colonies of Terns, mainly
of the curious Rhynchops, made an awful and objectionable noise day
and night.
In the Apure country the scenery is poor and monotonous. Every-
where flat grassland and rickety trees, swamps, lagoons. Near the
water small Caimans and colossal Anacondas swarm. There, too,
small Ardeidae ( Ardetta , Butorides, Florida, % Tigrisoma , Nyctanassa,
Nycticorax, etc.) are abundant, as well as Purple Gallinules and Jacanas.
A few Sun-bitterns and flocks of Scarlet Ibises and Roseate Spoonbills
are always in sight. Another curious inhabitant of the marshes is the
Rostrliamus sociabilis ; these dark birds of prey have a curved and
weak bill especially adapted to their peculiar life, as they only feed on
shell-fish and mussels ; they live in flocks, and other birds don't take
any notice of them.
Parrots, Macaws, and Parrakeets are numerous everywhere, and
also small birds--Tanagers, Saffron Finches, Cardinals, Ground Doves,
etc. But the very particular bird of the country is the Tloatzin. This
astonishing creature, which has been mistaken for a gallinaceous bird,
is to my mind a relation of the African Touracos rather than anything

else. They never leave the trees they live on ; they feed on leaves and
nest over the water ; their flight is heavy ; they can't walk, but they
climb easily among the branches. Their habits have been completely
described by Mr. W. Beebe, who studied the young ones. These have
prehensile claws on their wings (young Touracos also have them, but
less developed and useless) which they use to climb ; they also swim
and dive like reptiles, their near ancestors. Hoatzins are most plentiful
in the Apure district. During my visit at San Fernando I was able to
go and see some of the Egrets colonies. They can be found at a
distance of about 30 miles from the town, and are very far distant
from each other. They only include the Great Egret (Herodias egretta),
but these number thousands and thousands. Their breeding places are
known as " garceros '' and the sleeping stations as " dormitorios
Both are situated on marshy land, along the river and lagoons, where
low and thick trees grow. They are private properties and carefully
kept, as a big income is obtained from picking up the ornamental
feathers. It is a wonderful sight to watch the Egrets coming back
at night. From all directions great white birds are flying towards
the dormitorio ", where they alight with hoarse croaks. The aspect
of a " garcero " with nests touching each other and thousands of young
ones is also very striking.
We left San Fernando, taking with us a Ford lorry to carry our
live animals : Agoutis (of the new species that I have described as
Dasyprocta apurensis), Tiger Cats, Capybaras, Parrots, Macaws and
Parrakeets, Curassows and Guans, King Vulture, Adjutant Stork,
Tree-ducks, Orinoco Geese, Owls, Sun-bitterns, Purple Gallinules,
Snake Birds, Jacanas. At Camoguans we took the small birds we had
left behind : Black-cheeked Cardinals. Tanagers, Parrakeets, etc. The
return to the coast through the Llanos was very difficult, as there are
no roads. Anyhow, all animals arrived in good condition, except for
a few Avaders whose legs got broken.
At Caracas Ave took the birds Ave had left : Calliste arthuri,
cyanoptera , atricapilla, cyanescens, guttata, desmaresti, Chlorophonia
frontalis, Euphonia ccerulcocephala, Tanagra cana, olivicyanea, Cassicus

Scardafella ridgwayi, Leptoptila verreauxi, and one Humming-bird that
I took as a trial, Chlorostilbon viridis.
We sailed for Trinidad with that menagerie on 1st January on
board the Dutch s.s. Stuyvesend.
Trinidad
After two days sailing along the coast of Venezuela, the magnificent
Mouth of the Dragons opens to our view ; the hilly islets, all of a similar
formation, astonishingly regular, appeared as a line between Trinidad
and the Continent. They, as well as the two coasts, are very high and
extraordinarily green--the verdure of the West Indies, so intense that
it appears to be unreal--and the mountain at their northern extremity
falls precipitously into the sea.
Port of Spain is the most comfortable town of the West Indies.
We stayed there for a fortnight to rest our livestock, which were
greatly in need of it after the sea voyage. We installed them in a court-
yard, and the cages were arranged in a shed. The larger birds were
let out. During the crossing, many Tanagers and other fruit-eaters
were too crowded in their cages, and soiled their plumage terribly ;
they could not clean themselves properly without bathing, and in
spite of our care, we lost some twenty, amongst which was the beautiful
and rare Tanagra olivicyana, which never reconciled itself to captivity.
Trinidad closely resembles the neighbouring coast of Venezuela.
Its Flora and Fauna are almost identical with those of the Continent,
and recall but little those of the smaller West Indies.
The island is still rich in birds. They are now strictly protected,
for their numbers had been terribly diminished. For the most part,
one finds the same species as in the north of Venezuela. In the town
the same deafening cries of Tyrants and Tanagers.
Along the roads Troupials are numerous, and also the beautiful
golden-green Jacamars, which along with the Humming-birds, resort
to the telegraph wires. But we have something new : the Motmot of
Trinidad.
The Motmots are birds of the size of a Jay ; they have a big
head, marked with black and bright blue, fine ruby-coloured eyes,
and a strong, serrated bill; the body is dark yellowish green

underneath and bluish green above. But what is peculiar to the
Motmots is their long tail, of which the two central feathers are
terminated with racquets. It was always supposed that the bird
denuded the shaft, to form these racquets, with its own bill ; but
Mr. Astley, who has kept a Motmot (M. momota) since 1914 and has
carefully studied the moult, has come to the conclusion that the barbs,
naturally weak and degenerated, at that point, fall off gradually by
themselves in the course of a few weeks after the moult. Motmots
frequent dense undergrowth ; they nest in burrows which they excavate
in steep banks, after the manner of a Kingfisher. A kindly aviculturist,
who brought up one of these birds from the nest, most generously
offered it to me. A delightful present, for the Motmot of Trinidad,
peculiar to that island, had never been brought to Europe. It is
decidedly smaller, more brilliantly coloured and more elegant in form,
than the ordinary species of the Continent Momotus momota.
There are a few coloured and Chinese bird dealers in Port of Spain,
but they ask exorbitant prices. Of course, they only offer the common
Venezuela species. However, the favourite bird in Trinidad, as well
as in Demerara and Surinam, is the Grosbeak. These birds are always
kept by themselves in small cages, on account of their charming voices.
Each individual bird possesses a more or less varied song, and good
specimens are sold for more than #2. Of these Grosbeaks there are
two species : one, the size of a Chaffinch, is entirely black, except
for a few white feathers on the wing, with a short and very large white
beak (Oryzoborus crassiroslris). This species is the most appreciated
for its song. The other (0. torridus) is a little smaller, black above,
with some white on the wing and chestnut underneath ; the beak is
blackish. These two Grosbeaks inhabit all the north of the Continent
of South America, and are particularly numerous in the Guianas.
Some of the Seed-eaters ( Spermophila,) are also very favourite cage
birds on account of their song.
We embarked on the 15th Jamiary, on the little French steamer
VAntilles, with our menagerie, slightly diminished by a few losses and
only augmented by the Motmot. Some of the mammals and larger
birds, such as Geese, Ducks, Curassows, Parrots, etc., were left behind,
thanks to the kindness of the French Consul, who took care of them

until my return from Guiana. The VAntilles runs once a month from
Martinique to Cayenne, stopping at all the ports. We called at George-
town, Paramaribo, and the " lies du Salut", enchanting and salubrious
in the shade of the cocoanuts, in spite of their sinister reputation, as
the settlement of the most dangerous convicts, both political and
criminal. We arrived at Cayenne, a town of such unattractive aspect.
. dead and sordid, that, finding it was also unfavourable for ornitho-
logical research, we remained only four days. Anyhow, a few trips
in the neighbourhood were sufficient to give me a casual idea of the
country, and on the 21st January we again set out, this time in a
northerly direction, towards St. Laurent-du-Maroni.
The Maroni
The Guiana sea is shallow, yellow, and muddy, and above the
green line of the mangroves torn by the winds, the occasional hill-
tops, notably the Rock of Kouron, appear as mountains on that extra-
ordinarily low coast. But VAntilles has turned amidst the great rollers,
now we are on the Maroni.
The water of the estuary is muddy like the sea. On either
side of the flat banks, distant from one another several miles,
mangroves and palms advance far in the water, concealing the banks.
A few pairs of Blue-yellow Macaws are flying screaming. That is
really the only life one sees on the river and its banks ; no waterfowl,
no waders, no crocodiles ; nothing but the luxuriant vegetation which
deprives animals even of the space where they would live on the margin.
The contrast of the Guiana rivers, apparently without fauna, to that
of the Orinoco tributaries -- where animal life is so exuberant--is most
striking.
The little steamer continues up the Maroni for several hours ;
the water clears and becomes transparent, although always maintaining
its coffee tint, so characteristic of the Guiana rivers, due to the vegeta-
tion wdiich decays everywhere and stains the water. And there are
always very few birds to be seen on the banks. We turn about several
times ; we pass little islands ; the majestic river is hardly less wide
than at its mouth, and at last we are in sight of St. Laurent.
The forest, which everywhere shuts in the river, widens out ; a

clearing of a few square miles has been conquered with much trouble,
and on the edge one sees gigantic trunks, half dead, having a naked
appearance, separated as they are from their neighbours and from the
lower vegetation which bad previously surrounded them ; their isola-
tion has almost killed them.
A wharf of violet timber ; avenues planted with mango-trees along
which are pretty villas ; the huge buildings of the hospital ; and that
is the town of St. Laurent-du-Maroni. In the distance, 3 miles
off, on the opposite bank (which is the Dutch bank, for the Maroni
separates the two colonies), the houses of the little town of Albina,
painted in pale blue, appear completely overshadowed amongst the
great dark-green trees. People have a preconceived idea that
St. Laurent, the town of the convicts, is a " God-forsaken and terrible
place ". What a mistake ! its lovely avenues, with the well-kept
grass, trees garlanded with orchids and bromelias, its well-built houses
and shady gardens, make the official quarters a most agreeable spot,
especially when one compares it to the hideous streets and crumbling
houses of Cayenne. The commercial quarters, equally well kept,
are amusing owing to the extraordinary mixture of convicts and
liberated Europeans and Arabs, of coloured people, Chinese merchants,
Boni negroes 1 with their one garment of brilliant hue ; Bed Indians
who descend from the heart of the virgin forest to make certain
purchases.
As to the camps of the convicts, one does not even notice them.
One sees prisoners everywhere, clean-shaved, dressed in white linen,
wearing a large hat of palm leaves, employed in every kind of occupa-
tion, under the surveillance of the warders.
St. Laurent and its district belong to the Penitentiary Administra-
tion, which there reigns as absolute mistress, a great benefit to
naturalists visiting the country. All round St. Laurent convict
camps are established, some of which are regular towns, such as St. Jean-
du-Maroni. These camps are connected one with another by light
railways, which penetrate the virgin forest. One can travel on trucks

pushed by running convicts, which is a means of transport in the jungle
existing nowhere else.
The Director of the Administration came to see me on the quay ;
he placed at my disposal a fine and spacious house, surrounded by
a large garden with outbuildings which served admirably for the
installation of my collection. With the aid of the convicts, who were
given to us as servants, we quickly settled in. We arranged a laboratory,
bird-rooms, aviaries, and enclosures. Our greatest help was an old
convict, the guardian of the house, who gave many proofs of his good-
will. His Picardv accent drew my attention, and I soon discovered
that he came from Villers-Bretonneux, my own village of the Somme ;
he knew my grandfather, and after 35 years of exile he was quite
overcome at seeing a member of my family. His crime, a small burglary
--a very light one compared with those of most of his comrades, had
been augmented by his many attempts at escape ; and as he himself
says, the Bamboos Cemetery awaits him ; that cemetery, however,
is pretty, surrounded by immense bamboos, as tall as European trees.
During all my stay there, this man proved himself absolutely
dependable.
After having installed the Venezuelan livestock that w r e had brought
with us, we occupied ourselves in procuring Guiana species. I engaged
some liberated convicts who make it their profession to catch birds
to sell skins ; they use blowpipes with wonderful skill; in addition
to that, I provided them with traps, explaining to them how they
should be used. Every day they brought me in something they had
captured, which my assistant, Mr. F. Fooks, looked after.
There are many interesting birds in the town. Some Humming-
birds (Thalurania and Phcetornis) visited our garden every morning ;
in the large mango-trees Trogons call with a monotonous cry, while
hundreds of blue, palm, maroon, and black Tanagers swarm in the
trees. Amongst the long grass and shrubs are numerous Violet
Tanagers, Saffron Finches, Seed-eaters of different species, and glossy,
black Jacarinis. In the courtyards Passerine Doves run about fear-
lessly ; the Black Vultures encumber the streets and yards, while
large Martins (Progne chalybea) cover the roof of the hospital, where
they settle or fly about. They are close relations of the purple Martin
of the United States.

156 J. Delacour--Notes of a Bird-lover in Tropical America
The country surrounding St. Laurent can be divided into three
zones : the open and marshy " savanah ", intersected by canals and
streams ; the second growth, that is to say, the vegetation which
has pushed up since the clearing of the primitive forest; and, finally,
the virgin forest itself.
In the Savanahs one meets with the same birds as in the town and,
in addition, numerous Waders, Rails, Waterhens, etc. The pretty
black and white aquatic Tyrant ( Fluvicola pica) runs along the banks of
the streams. As to the Black Vultures ( Catliaristes urubu), one sees
them everywhere, and they are as tame as poultry ; one can count
by the hundred the " Urubus ", as they are called in Guiana, in the
vicinity of Cayenne and St. Laurent, and also in the towns them-
selves ; but the red-headed Turkey Vulture ( Cathartes aura) is very
rare. In the second growth, one finds an abundance of birds ; its
thick and lower trees, of the height of those of Europe, shelter quantities
of the smaller ones, while Tinamous inhabit the ground beneath.
Yellow-winged Sugar Birds were very numerous in January and
February ; at that season the males are in full colour, blue and black,
and frequent low trees covered with fruit, on which they feed ; it
is the most wonderful sight, for they have a habit of perching on the
extremities of the branches, where they produce a gorgeous effect,
especially when they open their wings, showing the bright yellow.
In the same places I met with and captured numerous Humming-
birds : Thaluriana furcata (the Cayenne Wood Nymph), Phcetornis
superciliosus, Glaucis liirsuta, Campylopterus largipennis, Florisuga
mellivora. All these little birds were stunned by my men's blqw-pipes,
loaded with bullets of soft earth. It was there also that I saw so many
Ground Doves, Leptoptila and Geotrygon.
But for the real untouched wild life one has to enter the virgin
forest, the jungle; "la Brousse " as it is called by the French
colonists. The forest has hardly been touched except in the immediate
vicinity of the towns and villages ; everywhere else its reign is
undisputed over plains, marshes, hills, and mountains. It is the vast
equatorial jungle of South America rvhich covers the continent from
the Orinoco to the pampas of Argentina, and from the Andes to the
Atlantic. And it is a marvel ! The lofty trunks uplift themselves

straight and close together to a height of 130 to 150 feet, finally spreading
out with superb branches. Everywhere enormous climbers force them-
selves upwards to hang down again like giant snakes ; Aroidce, orchids,
ferns, and, above all, Bromelias garnish the trunks and branches,
whilst from the ground rise everywhere palms and tree-ferns,
and various plants with red and yellow blossoms ( Iieliconias,
Ravenalas, etc.).
Contrary to what is generally supposed, the undergrowth of the
Guiana forests is not often entangled, and one can easily travel through
it; the one inconvenience is caused by the numerous patches of soft
mud and stagnant water which one has constantly to traverse and where
one may easily be engulfed. The surface of the ground is a succession
of mounds and marsh, cut up by creeks.

COLOUR-CHANGE IN FEATHERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998777473684211" page_id="32671053"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
A very interesting article from the pen of our Australian member,
Mr. G. A. Heumann, appeared in Aie Australian Zoologist of 17th May,
1922, of which the following is an extract:--
" In the same way as the food will influence the construction and
activity of the animal cell, so it must have an influence upon the kind
and the effect of the chemical colour matter. I need only mention the
different colours of the canaries which can be produced as red, white,
brown, etc. If cayenne pepper is mixed with the food for young
canaries the result is red canaries, but if this food is given at a later
period, that is to say when the birds are feathered, then only the down
and small feathers will show the colour-change, as only these will be
moulted out during the first moult, the larger feathers for the time
being remain unchanged, for the reason that this feather is meanwhile
dead and the matter changes within the body have ceased. This
example is proof that foodstuffs materially influence the coloration
of feathers, and I am of opinion that in this way the chemical colours
may not only be maintained but also strengthened and improved,
but of the ways and means in detail, how to achieve this are so far
a closed door to me.

both insectivorous and seed-eating birds require a certain amount of
live food, which itself has lived upon live plants. They absolutely
require this a few months before the moult sets in. I have tried this
on Orange Bishops in conjunction with feeding on unripe seed, such
as millet or grass-seed still in a milky state. I almost got back the
original scarlet colour ! Bed-breasted Australian Bobins fed upon
mealworms exclusively produced a dirty pink after the first moult,
others which received in addition to the ordinary soft bill food minced
raw beef became almost white, which shows that the mealworms fed
on dry vegetable matter like bran will not produce the natural scarlet
in the feathers. During my experiments with the Sanguineous
Honey-eater (Blood-bird) I allowed some of these to fly in a large
outdoor aviary set with grape-vines and other plants, which attracted
myriads of the tiny leaf-fly. The flies served the Blood-birds as food
in addition to the sugar-water they received. All these birds moulted
perfectly into their natural scarlet plumage. At the .same time others
were placed in a large cage with plenty of sunlight, and fed on sugar
water sprinkled only with dried and crushed cocoons of flies and with
powdered flies. The birds did very well on this diet and moulted
without trouble--but a washed-out pink ! This seems to prove that
it was the leaf-fly in conjunction with unlimited sunlight which caused
the natural colour to reappear.
" It is a remarkable fact that even in nature these colour changes
always affecting the red pigment may take place unconditioned by
age. I have seen in Fiji numbers of yellow-headed Parrot Finches
flying with flocks of red-headed ones, the true colour of the species.
1 have had young ones of this species which eventually moulted out
vellow-headed, neither is it an uncommon thing to see yellow- or copper-
headed Gouldians--the offspring of either black- or red-headed ones ;
and I may state here that I received for several years running a silver
white Galah, whose brothers and sisters out of the same nest were
naturally coloured. I think I am safe in saying that it is only the scarlet
which undergoes these variations, but where the actual cause lies is
still a mystery to me beyond what I know of experiments. The
common Blue Wren, for instance, which breeds freely in my aviary,
has always produced young which colour out according to nature,

A Young Spectacled Owl
When I had the pleasure of seeing Miss Chauner&apos;s collection of
Owls last.summer. I was greatly taken with her Spectacled Owl, a fine
adult specimen, beautifully tame, and of very striking appearance.
The Zoological Society had not possessed one of these Owls for nearly
thirty years, although before 1894 several had been exhibited under
the misleading name of " Downy " Owl. It was, therefore, with
much satisfaction that we purchased from Mr. Rogers a beautiful
young bird of this species. It is still in down plumage so far as its
head is concerned, and its appearance is decidedly quaint, the head
being covered with whitish down, the face black relieved by its large
orange-coloured eyes. Like Miss Chauner's bird, it delights in
being petted and in having its head scratched.

Amongst recent arrivals at the Zoological Gardens are some half-
dozen Cream-coloured Coursers (Cursorius gallicus) from Egypt,
and they appear to be the first examples of this species exhibited
at the Gardens. Its home is in the Canary Islands, North Africa,
Arabia, away to Northern India, but its migrations have taken it into
several European countries, including England. It is an elegant,
plover-like bird of desert-loving habits, its coloration harmonizing
well with the sand, and its food consisting of insects. It was kept in
captivity as long ago as 1851, for Saunders records a bird brought
to Favier of Tangiers in that year which lived until 1859, laying eggs
each year which were used to stock the collections of several European

possession of a large log nest, which had been fixed up some time ago
for some Choughs. The keeper did not know that they had serious
intentions of nesting, and was surprised one day at the end of September
by the appearance of two lusty young Graclcles, which except for the
dullness of their plumage were just like their parents.
This is a very handsome Starling with pure white plumage and
black wings, and, so far as I know, has not previously bred in captivity.
Its home is in Java.

In the last number of the Magazine Mr. Astley referred to the Birds
of Paradise introduced some years ago by Sir William Ingram to the
island of Little Tobago as Lesser Birds of Paradise (Paradisea minor).
This is a mistake, as it is the Greater Bird of Paradise (Paradisea

<bodyText confidence="0.9971096" page_id="32671056"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
It is with much regret that we announce the death of two well-
known and highly esteemed members of the Society. Mr. Bonhote
joined the Society at its foundation, was a contributor to its first volume,
and has been an active and most useful member during the twenty-
eight years of the Society's life. He was a member of the Linnean
and Zoological Societies and the British Ornithologists' Union, and
published a number of valuable papers both on Mammals and Birds.
He had been ill for some months past, and died at Bournemouth on
10th October. We hope to publish a fuller notice by one of his most
intimate friends in our next number.
Mr. Temple died at his residence at Datchet on 13th October,
after a short illness. He joined the Society in 1907, and was well
known to many of our members as a keen and successful aviculturist.
He was also a great authority on the various breeds of dogs and other
domestic animals.

By J. Delacour
(Continued from p. 157.)
The fauna of the virgin forest is very rich, but it is not always
easy to observe it on account of the depth and luxury of the foliage.
The mammals and birds have a thousand ways of concealing themselves
at the least sound which causes suspicion, so that one must take
precautions and exercise patience in order not to awaken their fear.
On the other hand, the birds of the forest are essentially wanderers,
certain species frequenting one district at a particular season, where
they remain for some weeks, and then disappear to be replaced by others.
These local migrations are caused by the abundance of fruits or insects,
and also depend upon the breeding season. Furthermore, one does
not often find the same birds in the same spot for more than a day
or two at a time. Yet numerous species, widely differing, gather
together in huge flocks and wander through the jungle.
All this does not facilitate their observation and capture. My bird-
catchers were wonderfully well up in their knowledge of the birds of
Guiana ; they know the seasons when they frequent certain districts,
and even certain trees, and also the species one would meet with at
the different times of the year. They have given names, often very
appropriate, to those species which particularly attract their attention?
and I cannot resist the pleasure of quoting some of these quaint
appellations ; quaint, that is to say, in French, but unfortunately they
for the most part lose much of their meaning in English,

of its rotund figure, serious mien, and bald head ! A brown bird, the
size of a rook ( Calvifrons calms). The famous bell-bird is a relative.
During the six weeks I spent in the Maroni district I went to the
forest nearly every day ; in a truck or a launch I reached the proposed
6pots, then walked through the jungle, followed by a few convicts.
Now and then, I undertook trips of several days through the virgin
forest or on the rivers, from Mana, on the coast, to above the Hermina
Falls, the first rapids of the Maroni, always escorted by my convicts,
whose behaviour was exemplary throughout. It is amusing, at night,
in the camp to listen to the confidences of the men. They generally
try to present their crime in the most favourable light, and if they were
to be believed they always had to do with murders committed in a
moment of passion. It is well worth hearing them speak shamefacedly
of their " misfortune " ! I ought to say that the murderers form a
sort of aristocracy in the Penal Settlement, looking down upon the
thieves ! Those, they say, have acted with malice prepense ; the
assassins, on the contrary, have just let themselves go for a moment,
but remain honest men !
The aspect of the virgin forest varies very little. Where the soil
is sandy and less rich, the big trees are replaced by the enormous
Maripa and thorny Awara Palms ( Maximiliana and Astrocaryum),
which make excellent salad.

grow (Euterpe) ; here and there the forest is intersected by a vast
swamp, which is generally concealed by high grasses ; on the banks
grow the Mucka-Mucka (Arum arboreum) and enormous Mauritia palms
with fandike leaves, whose lofty trunks uplift themselves to the height
of 150 feet, encircling the savanah ; whilst lovely white and pink
Water-lilies, which open at night, rest upon the surface of the open
water.
One hides oneself at the foot of a tree, remaining absolutely stdl,
field-glasses in hand ; and before long the inhabitants of the forest
commence to show themselves on the ground ; Agoutis,&apos; Ant-eaters,
Curassows, Guans, Pigeons, and Tinamous come out to find their
food ; the pretty little black Manakins, with silver-white, golden-yellow,
or scarlet heads, shine on the low branches in company with numerous
species of Ant-thrushes, with long legs and short tails, reddish-brown,
varied with black and white. Golden Green Jacamars perch on the
twigs. Sometimes one finds oneself in the domain of the Motmots,
which look at you from their thickets, swinging their curious racqueted
tails from right to left after the manner of a clock's pendulum, and
uttering bubbling notes ; and then again one discovers a ground Dove's
nest. Above the tree-tops the Toucans pass with their hugely prominent
bills, and some pairs of Parrots which stop, chattering at a height of
200 feet amongst the highest branches. There are many species of
Amazons, Caiques, Pionus, Macaws, Conures, and also some Hawk-
headed Parrots, so beautiful and so rare in captivity. How tantalizing !
But there is no hope of capturing these birds, nor even of shooting them,
for they are too high up.
At times certain trees are transformed for a few hours into a veritable
aviary by flocks of birds which come to feed on the fruits. I surprised
such troops on several occasions, which permitted me to observe them
at my ease. One finds various species mingled together. Troupails
with yellow or red backs ; violet and yellow or green and pink Trogons,
brown Wood-hewers; striped Woodpeckers with scarlet crests ;
Toucans, Cuckoos, Tanagers, etc. It is a fairy gathering !
Other trees are used as a rendezvous for smaller species, such as
yellow-winged and purple Sugar-birds, and turquoise and black-headed
Honey-creepers. The purple Sugar-birds are very abundant in the

forest. There are also emerald-spotted and Cayenne Tanagers, whilst
Humming-birds mingle amongst them and attack them.
Passing through the jungle, one surprises on the tops of the trees
flocks of Paradise Tanagers ( Calliste paradisea), whose colours of
scintillating cerulean blue and emerald green are further enhanced
by a back of brilliant orange gold.
Round the scarlet sprays of the blossoms of an enormous " vine "
the Topaz Humming-birds buzz ; a splendid species almost as large as
a small Swallow. The red, yellow, and green hues, iridescent and
metallic in the male with his lyre-shaped tail feathers ; the golden
green colouring of the female ; their activity and their lightning-like
movements make up a picture which enchants and astonishes. One
never sees more than one couple at a time, for any intruders are driven
away with sharp cries. Indeed, the Topaz Humming-birds bully all
other birds The smaller species frequent the lower parts of the jungle.
The colonies of Cassiques are numerous round the camps and along
the creeks ; they prefer tall, isolated trees in which to suspend their
long, purse-like nests, and it is not uncommon to see trees containing
a hundred.
Save for these noisy gatherings of birds silence generally reigns in
the forest. Only the Cotingas break the calm with their strange and
resounding calls. The magnificent blue Cotingas, whose plumage is
brilliant ultramarine satin with rich purple breast, and the curious
Pompadour, claret coloured and white, are not very noisy, but " the
bird my father " ( Calvifrons) lows like a cow. The Attila endlessly
repeats an unfinishing and irritating song ; the white Bell-bird makes
the forest resound with his sonorous gong, which cry can be heard at
several miles' distance, and as for the call of the Laihrea , it strikes the
traveller with wonder and astonishment.
In the solitary silence of the jungle, a piercing whistle rings out,
after a kind of raucous coo : " R-roo--R-roo." " Pi-pi-pi-yo." It
is a whistle which almost tears the drum of the ear ; another bird
answers in the distance, and the cry resounds once more from the
same spot, to be taken up by others in their turn, and for hours the
deafening concert continues.
It is difficult to make out the authors of this tumult of sound;

J. Delacour--Notes of a Bird-lover in Tropical America 165
one would think that it is produced by a bird of much larger size than
is actually the case, but one ends in discovering an ashy-grey bird, the
size of a Thrush, of quite ordinary proportions in every way, sitting im-
moveable on a high branch. This bird, perching in a normal position,
gives forth the double coo, and then throwing back its head on to the
back, distends its throat, and emits its astonishing call; two whistles,
strident and sharp, and then one, more drawn out and descending.
It can be heard at about 3 miles off.
But it is really impossible to attempt to describe the charm of the
Guiana birds ; neither would a whole volume suffice to do so . . .
Another great attraction in the virgin forest is the abundance of
the great blue Butterflies, the Morphos. Nowhere in the Guianas
or Venezuela are they so numerous as on the banks of the Maroni on
the French side ; many species of the family ( Hecubas , Menelaus, etc.)
swarm in the woods, where they continually flit along the open trails.
These wonderful insects descend with gentle flight, falling like sheets
of light paper from the tree tops to the ground, the dazzling blue of their
wings shining with magnificent metallic gloss. They always seem to
fly from a height downwards. Measuring about 8 inches across the
wings, they are seen against the dark-green background of the tropical
foliage, and present a richness of colouring which no one who has not
been out of Europe can imagine. A thousand other species of Butter-
flies of smaller size, less gaudy but very beautiful, inhabit the forests,
whilst the gorgeous Urania, green and brilliant blue barred with black,
is extraordinarily common in St. Laurent, even over the river itself.
Yet the jungle is not all joy ; the mosquitoes are innumerable
and irritating, as well as carriers of fever. The Vampire Bats, Blood-
suckers, abound ; and one has to shelter oneself under the mosquito
curtains in a hammock when one is sleeping out at night under the
stars. But there the danger of the forest ends, for attacks from
Jaguars and other carnivores need not be feared, any more than
poisonous Snakes which avoid human beings, as well as other stinging
creatures, such as Scorpions, Spiders, Centipedes, which one seldom
sees and which run away as much as possible. I never had the least
feeling that any of these would ever attack or bite me, and I never
took any precautions to avoid them.

It is no easy matter to accustom the feathered inhabitants of the
tropical jungle to captivity. Certain species are very refractory;
at different times we attempted to keep Jacamars and Manakins in
cages, but without success. Some lived for a few days, others a few
weeks, appearing to become accustomed to the food, only to succumb
in the end. Tanagers, Cassiques, Barbets, Toucans, Sugar-birds,
Quit-quits, etc., accustomed themselves very quickly to a diet of bread
and milk ; insectile mixture for the insectivorous birds, and fruits,
of which bananas, and above all papaya, are the best one can find,
but guava was also greatly appreciated. Small waders, although more
difficult, take well to chopped meat, mixed with meal, etc. Seed-
eaters are generally wild and it is difficult to induce them to feed,
and one loses a good many at first; but our most interesting experience
was with the Humming-birds. These wonderful little things were all
caught with the aid of a blow-pipe loaded with pellets of soft earth,
by which means they were stunned, and were almost always brought to
me in an unconscious state. We then held them in our hands to revive
them and make them feed. Each Humming-bird was placed in a small
cage fitted with fine twigs and a special food vessel covered in metal
with small holes pierced to permit the birds to insert their bills, at the
same time preventing them from soiling their plumage. They were fed
upon a mixture of Mellins' food, milk, and honey, which was sometimes
substituted by phosphatine in place of the Mellins'.
At first we had to hold each bird for at least ten minutes to induce
it to insert its bill into the liquid food and take nourishment, and they
often drank of themselves after three or four attempts on our part.
When they refused we placed their beaks in our mouths and inhaled
gently, which generally produced the desired result. If a Humming-
bird was unwilling to feed, we had recourse to the unfailing means of
dipping its beak as far as the nostrils in the liquid, which forced it to
put out the tongue, when it at once drank greedily.
The effect of the food upon these birds is extraordinary and
immediate. A Humming-bird which seemed to be lifeless, buzzed
about actively in a minute's time ; but, on the other hand, it would
quickly fail again, so that one had to again make it feed as soon as it
showed signs of drooping. We found that it was necessary to catch

the birds in the morning so that they had the rest of the day in which to
recuperate, for Humming-birds caught in the evening died more
frequently. Usually they will feed by&apos;themselves between four and
six hours after their capture, when they begin to realize that their
food vessel is as good as any flower filled with nectar and tiny insects,
and they then pay it frequent visits. One must watch them carefully
until one sees that they can feed by themselves, and then one must not
touch them again. They feed very often and take very little at a time.
Certain individuals and certain species are more difficult to accustom
to cage life ; for example, the superb Topaz Humming-bird will not feed
by itself for thirty-six or forty-eight hours, and this species is very wild
where others quickly tame.
The great difficulty is with regard to the food, which in a tropical
climate so quickly goes sour, and one has to mix it fresh several times
in the day, particularly in the morning before sunrise, so that the
Humming-birds could run no risk of drinking sour food. One should
not, however, remove the food vessel over night, after the birds have
gone to sleep, for they tumble down and are unable to find their perches
again, which would be fatal. Humming-birds are so pugnacious that
it is impossible to keep them together in a cage. I tried to put two
females together, and also a pair, but hardly had they recovered from
the shock of their capture, than they fell upon each other immediately.
Thanks to constant attention we did not lose more than ten per cent
of our Humming-birds, and on leaving St. Laurent we took with us
thirty birds representing the following species: Topaza pella,
Campilopterus largipennis, Florisuga mellivora, and Thalurania furcata,
the two latter being the most numerous. These are exquisite little birds,
the male having the breast and back violet-blue, the throat brilliant
emerald green, with metallic lights. The female is pearl grey and golden
green. This species was very abundant in the neighbourhood of
St. Laurent in January and February, but the birds disappeared at
the end of March. My collection was further increased by Tinamous
(Crypturus sou&apos;i), Grey-fronted Doves (Leptoptila rufaxilla), Cayenne
Rails (Creciscus cayennis), various Macaws, Jacarini Finches, and
other little seed-eaters, Saltators, Quit-quits, and many Tanagers, not
to mention some mammals.

NOTES ON BREEDING THE WHITE-BREASTED
GROUND PIGEON (PHLOGCENAS JOBIENSIS ) 1
By Herbert Bright
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97424888" page_id="32671070"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
Mr. Page has given the following description of this beautiful
Pigeon, so I cannot do better than quote his words. He calls it " a near
relative of the Bleeding Heart Pigeon, from which, however, it differs
entirely in deportment and coloration, and to which we have given the
trivial name of White-breasted Pigeon or Dove. The Bleeding Heart
Pigeon in captivity spends most of its time upon the ground, but during
two days we did not see it upon the ground at all. The general
coloration is rich vinous-cinnamon refulgent with a purplish sheen ;
upper eye streak, lower eye region, whole of the throat and breast
white narrowly margined with black, the whole of its appearance being
very handsome and gorgeously beautiful." I have since discovered
a point of importance that we both missed when looking at the birds.
It is the way, in my pair, at all events, of distinguishing the sexes.
In the male bird the white eye streak meets over the base of the beak
while in the hen there is a narrow dividing line where the dark colour
of the head runs right down to the beak, cutting through the white.
I noticed this when looking at the hen sitting on her young. She was
very tame at this period, and would not move when we passed within
a foot of her nest. My birds came over in a consignment of Australian
birds, and I was assured they were a true pair, but was much amused
later on when talking to the then owner to hear that he thought they
were two cocks. He had evidently not noticed this difference. They
had been well cared for on their long journey, and were in good condition

except that one had its wing cut short right across the primary flights.
I let both birds have their liberty, thinking they would be all right,
but found the cut-winged bird climbed up as high as possible and then
went bump on the floor of the aviary when anyone came near, so I had
to cage it until the flights were renewed. This took some weeks, but
may have helped to induce the birds to breed, the weather being fine
when I gave this bird its liberty, and the two birds were evidently
delighted to meet. They soon started to go to nest, selecting a well-
sheltered spot in a creeper growing thickly on one of the standards
of the outdoor flight. Here they sat and, I believe, hatched one young
one--I saw them feeding for a few days, but they left the nest after
that and I found only a clear egg there. Both nest and egg closely
resembled the usual Doves' nest, consisting of a few thin twigs lightly
put together. The cock was very wild, and used to dash off when anyone
came near the aviary. I think he must have thrown the first young one
out in one of his wild rushes. He actually did this in the second nest,
only I fortunately found the young one on the ground and put it back
in the nest. It was about four days old at the time. The birds selected
a precisely similar position for their next nest, but this time it was the
corner post by the door of the aviary, and I had faint hopes of rearing
any young ones. However, fortune favoured me, and all went well.
The hen never flew off her eggs or yok ing , except on one occasion, when
they were just about ready to fly, and I tried to get a good look at the
family. The hen got nervous and dashed off, and out flopped first one
and then the other of the two young birds. It was a cold damp evening,
so I thought I would try and put them back in the nest, but had
slight hopes that they would stop there. I have tried several times
to do this on previous occasions with other Doves but always
found the young birds jump out again. However, this time I got
both of them and put them in together, keeping my hand over
them for a little time, and then taking it quickly away again when
I saw the hen coming back. I slipped away and the hen
came right on to the nest and settled down for the night. They
remained in the nest two days after this, although the older bird was
well able to get about when I disturbed them. The younger one
was not quite fully feathered. After leaving the nest, I never saw

a sign of them for a week and then I found one, then some days later
I saw the other, but it was days later still before the old birds brought
the young ones into the bird house where the birds are fed ; now they
come regularly, and I have seen them feeding on several occasions.
The young are rather unusual-looking birds, being smoky black all
over except for a slightly grey shade on face and breast. There is
hardly a trace of the beatiful purplish sheen of the old birds and no
white markings. The beak is light horn-colour, but is turning quickly
darker. The young hen is a little lighter in colour and a little greyer
on face and breast than the cock, also at present a little smaller.
Although my birds spend very little time on the ground, I think they
have a decided look of the Bleeding Heart Pigeon. The only sound
I have heard them make is a very unmusical grunt. The cock made
this noise continually when driving the hen to nest. They still go
about with the two young ones, which are very wild, and have evidently
finished all breeding operations for this season. I have found them
quite good tempered with other Doves, and have never seen them take
the slightest notice of the numerous other Doves in the aviary, nor have
any of the other Doves interfered with them.

patches variegated with fawn-colour, and the neck is flushed with
refulgent vinous-pink. Bare skin round the eyes, red ; legs and feet,
red. Total length, 11 |inches, of which the tail measures nearly
5 inches (approximately 4 |inches).
The female is slightly duller, more slenderly built, and the ashy-
wash on the sides of body and back more distinct than in the male.
Juvenal plumage very similar to adults, but paler, and the under
parts are sandy brown ; no neck patches.
It is a native of North-East Africa, and is a very pretty and hand-
some Dove. I obtained these birds from Mr. Rogers, of Liverpool, who,
I believe, got them from the Giza Zoo at Cairo. There were four
of this species among various other Doves, and I liked them so well
that I brought them away with me. On my arrival home, the weather
being warm and fine, I selected what I felt sure were a true pair, and
turned them into my large aviary--I had no hesitation in doing this,
as the birds were in perfect condition and plumage.
The outward difference between the sexes being infinitesimal, I first
picked out, as a hen, the smallest and slimmest bird of the four, and
then took the largest and boldest of the other three, and felt pretty
sure that I had picked out a true pair, and later events proved this
to be correct. The other two I put into another aviary, and I feel
sure they are both of the same sex, as they have never shown the least
inclination to pair nor make any attempt to construct a nest. -I
believe them to be males.
The pair in the large aviary settled down almost at once, and in
about a fortnight I saw the cock driving the hen about and displaying
to her, but, at first, she took but little notice of him. She evidently
had not fully got over the importation journey and change of home,
but the male persisted and a little later I saw her carrying small
twigs into a clump of elder bushes, in the forks of which they constructed
a fairly substantial nest of stout twigs for the base and finer twigs on
top. The hen laid almost immediately, and in due course hatched
out two squabs, which were fully reared. They remained in the nest
until they were fully feathered, and there was barely room for both.
I looked at them several times, and began to wonder when they would
venture out, for they appeared as well grown as their parents.

Eventually I saw one young bird perching in the elder quite close to
the nest. When at last they began to go about the aviary they were
able to do so as easily as their parents. This is quite different to most
species of Doves, as the young mostly leave the nest at a very early
age, and, being somewhat helpless at first, losses are not uncommon,
and I was gratified that the Isabellines were wiser than most of their
kind. The parent birds soon brought them over to the seed tray,
and they started at once to pick up seed for themselves.
Without loss of time, the hen laid again in the same nest, and brought
out another pair of strong young Doves as before. They at once went
to nest again, as before occupying the original nest, and brought out
another pair of equally strong young birds, though the weather was
then quite cold, with much rain.
Just before the above pair was hatched I wanted to send a pair
away to a friend, and had great trouble in picking them out, owing
to the adult hen being in moult and the earlier youngster with the
adult plumage all but complete.
When the young left the nest they lacked the dark body markings
and neck patches of the adults, and their plumage generally was paler
than that of their parents.
This species is no trouble in the aviary among the other thirty
or so small Doves of various species, only showing a little temper when
their nest was too closely approached. The young were equally
amiable, and did not interfere at all with their parents' subsequent
nesting operations, nor with the later young birds after their exit
from the nest.
When Mr. Page was here on a visit in July last, he rather thought
this species had been bred at the London Zoo, but subsequent inquiries
prove that they have not yet had the species in their collection, so,
apparently, this is the first time Isabellines have reared young in
England.

REMARKS ON SOME CASSOWARIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982213176470588" page_id="32671075"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
By Frederick D. Welch
In October, 1920, there arrived in the London Gardens two
Cassowaries, which were labelled finally as Casuarius violicollis from
the Aru Islands, the English name being Violet-necked Cassowary.
As these bulky birds are flightless, having only rudimentary wings,
and as it seemed by no means unlikely that they might in future years
become extinct through being hunted by the natives in these islands,
which are not extensive enough for a species to spread and range
widely, it occurred to me that a description of them might be worth
writing in order to show the alteration as they approached adult life.
When first seen by me they were in immature feathering of brown
on body and legs ; and there were short brown feathers on head and
neck except where the two fleshy wattles were on the anterior and
lower part of the throat side by side, and where the horny substance
was on crown of head--the casque-site. This latter was quite flattened,
and both birds were then often uttering the chirping noise so often
made by young Cassowaries of various species. According to my
notebook, on 3rd January, 1921, both birds were as follows : Crown
of head (casque place excepted) and round ear holes covered still
with short brown feathers ; skin, greenish-blue in colour around eyes
(the iris being brown) except the upper anterior part, which was whitish.
The skin round the ear holes can be seen, viewed between the feathering,
to be greeny-blue, as also the skin round wattles ; but the wattles
are of a pinkish-white colour. Beak was slaty-grey, as also horny
substance on crown ; legs greyish. At that date they stood about
25 inches in height at level of back, and were both then of same size,
and plumage on body round legs, etc., was still brown.
On 16th June, 1921, according to my notes, wattles are brighter
coloured, with more pinkish red, with skin around them now markedly
blue, extending up the throat as far as ear holes. Round eye and
above level of ear holes the skin is more of a greenish-blue, and there
are still brown feathers on the crown (excluding casque-site) distributed
thickly. On throat, however, and round wattles the brown feathers
have almost all been shed ; but they are still present at back of neck

low down where the skin colour can be seen showing between the
feathering as a bright red patch.
Other parts of plumage were different in the birds by this date,
when one had grown larger, being about 32 inches at level of back,
whereas the other was about 29, there having appeared a marked
blackish hue on the shoulders and back of the smaller bird--and,
to a lesser extent, blackish also on those of the larger. The rest of
the feathers on body and round legs were very similar in both birds,
being brown. This different extent of blackish hue, and also the
different size, suggested to me they were different sex--the smaller
being a male.
It is, I believe, the case in some other species of Cassowary, that
the males are smaller than females (in this being analogous to some
birds of prey). The height of the smaller bird from the ground-level
to the crown of its head would be about 43 inches, the casque itself
being about Jin. high--this being estimated from the living bird.
Owing to temporary ill-health, I could not continue the observations
during the winter of 1921-2, and it was not until 15th June, 1922,
that I found it possible to proceed with the observations.
During the year both birds had grown, the height of the smaller
at the level of the back being about 33 or 34 inches, that of the larger
about 36 ; while the height at the casque, when standing, was about
49 inches in the smaller, 54 in the larger bird. Both still had brown
feathering round legs and on body near tail end. The casque in both
birds was about 1 inch high, rounded from side to side and behind,
and dark grey in colour.
The iris was brown, and head and neck were now bare of feathers.
Above the level of the eye and ear holes the skin was bluish and tinged
with white ; below this it was dark violet blue (from which part the
species presumably takes its name of Violet-necked) except the back
of the neck, where the colour was red and the skin wrinkled.
The wattles were more reddish than a year ago ; and the division
between them where they met each other in the medium line of the
throat was longer in the smaller bird, being about inches, than in
the other bird, in which it was about 1 inch.
I cannot say with certainty whether this different length of slit

between the wattles is only an individual variation in these birds
now in the Zoological Gardens, or whether it is a sexual difference,
and therefore constant in males and in females. But which ever
it be, there seems worth while laying some stress on the difference
in wattle in the two Casuarms violicollis now in the Gardens. It
may be not out of place here to insert that in the Two-wattled Cassowary
(Casuarius bicarunculatus ) from Aru Islands the wattles are differently
placed, being separated from each other by about an inch, and not
side by side as in C. violicollis. By August smaller bird was almost
all black. The beak was dark in both birds, a blackish-grey, as
also legs.
A position in which Cassowaries show to advantage, in my opinion,
is when they are seen by the observer side view and sitting at rest
on the toes and part of leg above as far as the next joints--these parts
of the legs being applied on to the ground, the toes being in line with
the part of leg above--the upper part of legs being vertical (as they
are in standing) and the head and neck carried erect as the bird sits
still resting itself.
In this position the shape of these peculiar birds can be observed
better than when walking. Cassowaries feed on greens such as lettuces
and such-like vegetation in captivity. Whether the present birds
will lay eggs, which are large, blue-green colour, is of course uncertain
at the date this description was penned (September, 1922). But
as other species, such as the non-wattled Westermann's Cassowary
(Casuarius westermani) from the Island of Jobi, and the One-wattled
Cassowary ( Casuarius unia-ppendiculatus ) from New Guinea laid in
the Gardens to my knowledge in past years, previous to 1910, it is
not unlikely that the above described Violet-necked Cassowaries may
also do so. If a true pair (as I believe), it will be of interest if the
eggs prove fertile.
At middle of August, 1922, the smaller (? male) C. violicollis
frequently uttered a sound like " boo-boo ", the throat dilating during
such, which was obviously a voice of pleasure, being uttered when
eating. I did not myself hear the other violicollis utter it.
In concluding, a few remarks as to the geographical range of
Cassowaries may be worth adding. The deep-sea channel between

176 Frederick D. Welch--Remarks on some Cassowaries
the islands of Borneo and Celebes, Bali, and Lombok, which is known
to science as " Wallace's Line ", beii^g so named after Dr. A. R. Wallace,
is presumably more interesting to mammal workers than to ornitho-
logical ones as a boundary line in zoological distribution, because
mammals, except bats, cannot fly, and some few such as flying-
phalangers (a sort of marsupial), flying squirrels, the total number
of which is not numerous if we include only those capable of some
miles flight. It is clear, therefore, that mammals are more restricted
in range than birds are by the sea.
But the Cassowaries are, on account of their rudimentary wings
(which are of no use in carrying such bulky bodies in flight even for
a short distance), restricted in range by the sea boundaries, and are
confined to the south-east of Wallace's Line in the islands there, Aru,
Ceram, New Guinea, New Britain and such-like, none of them extending
over the line into Java or Borneo.
This seems to me to point to the fact that the group must have
had these rudimentary wings at a period very, very far back indeed into
the long-distant past ages of the World's History. Otherwise they
would almost certainly have crossed Wallace's Line.

The Maroni river is at times subject to big storms. When I left
St. Laurent for Albina, where I had to take the little Dutch coastal
steamer for Paramaribo, huge waves beat against my boat, so that it
took me half an hour to cross the river, and I was only able to land after
many difficulties.
The voyage from Albina to Paramaribo, following the Maroni and
coasting along Dutch Guiana, has nothing to commend it. A rough
sea and a cockle-shell boat encumbered with coloured people, Chinese
and a regular medley of humans. I was already acquainted with
Paramaribo on the Surinam river, which gives to the town itself and to
the whole colony their names. The river resembles both the Maroni
and all the other water-courses of the Guianas, vast and brown, with
muddy shapeless banks.
The capital of Dutch Guiana is very pleasing ; the pretty pale-blue
houses, many of which carry the mark of the eighteenth century, the
broad avenues of the flaming flamboyant trees, the lovely botanical
garden, and the general air of neatness and prosperity, give a sense of
calm and repose.
The population of 40,000 inhabitants is so mixed and so picturesque
that one is never tired of observing it--Indians, Hindoos, Javanese,

178 J. Ddacour -- Notes of a Bird-lover in Tropical America
Chinese, Negroes, Europeans, and all the possible combinations of these
races, each one preserving for the most part its particular costume,
modes of living, fetes, etc.
At Surinam one finds the same kinds of birds as at Cayenne. At the
house of an aviculturist, who collects birds and animals to send to the
Zoological Gardens of Rotterdam, I saw a Trumpeter, a young Spectacled
Owl, a Curassow, and various mammals. In cages in the windows were
Grosbeaks, Seed-eaters (Sporophiloe), and some violet Tanagers.
Thanks to the kindness of the Director of Agriculture and of his
assistant forester, who was willing to serve as my guide, I made some
interesting excursions in the country. The virgin forest has been much
more cut down than in French Guiana ; by which means numerous
pastures have been acquired which surround the farms, and where
Anis and Grackles abound.
These farms are worked by " Boers ", Dutch peasants, whose clear
complexions and fair hair are very conspicuous in the tropics, where
nearly all the other people are more or less coloured.
The jungle of Surinam is much the same as that of the Maroni, and
the fauna is also similar.
But the species of Humming-birds are rather different. Thalurania,
which was so common there, was absent; this species being replaced by
Phcetornis and Agyrtria, neither of which I had seen before. I imagine
that the great watercourses assist to a certain degree to disperse and
separate certain species. In the fields of the plantations gained from
the forest, certain species are particularly abundant, notably the
Grosbeaks (Oryzohorus and Sporophila). Parrots (Conurus and Psittacula),
and the curious black Puff-birds, which rather resemble a'Swift
(Chelidoptera brasiliensis). These birds perch on dead branches at a
great height, from which they fly from time to time to immediately
return to the tree. One also sees there the Paradise Jacamar (Urogalba
Paradisea), so pretty with its long bill and tail, and its plumage of blue
and rich green marked with white on the throat.
A very charming bird of prey abounds in this region, the
" Nauclere " ( Elano&apos;ides furcatus), with the form of a Swallow, sharply
pointed wings and forked tail, pure bluish-grey in colour, with an ex-
ceedingly light and graceful flight.

J. Delacoui--Notes of a Bird-lover in Tropical America 179
Demerara
After spending a week at Surinam, I again boarded the horrible little
coasting steamer, with the same unwelcome style of coloured passengers
and the same inconveniences, and disembarked the next day at Nickerie,
crossing the vast estuary of the river Corentyn in a launch, and landing
at Springland in British Guiana. Dunlins (?) were flying over the river
on their spring migration.
A pretty canal, covered with rose-coloured Lotus flowers, welcomed
us, and a Ford car took us to Georgetown (Demerara) along the excellent
coastal road, passing New Amsterdam and crossing the river Berbice,
a haunt of a colony of Hoatzins. These extraordinary birds are much
less abundant there than on the Apure in Venezuela. The coast for
a distance of about 150 miles along the road is worn away, and is now
a flat country, semi-inundated, intersected with canals, where innumer-
able cattle are reared, and rice is also cultivated. The huts of the
Hindoos succeed one another uninterruptedly, miserable and sordid
on their piles over the water. Tens of thousands of Bengal coolies
live along the road. The monotonous country, bordered by the
horribly muddy sea, is unvaried except for the cocoanut plantations,
the brilliant scarlet sprays of the flowers of the beautiful " Flamboyant "
trees, the rose-coloured lotus and the huge Victoria Regia which covers
the waters of the canals, and above all the numerous Blue Herons and
Egrets which move about amongst the cattle and on the beach. George-
town, with its 60,000 inhabitants--Hindoos, Negroes, people of mixed
blood and Europeans, all noisily employed in their various businesses--
offers little interest to the naturalist except in its museum of Natural
History, where one finds good local collections. Certain live birds are
offered for sale in the market, but at exorbitant prices. One is gratified
to find that the fauna is effectively protected in the colony.
The Botanical Garden of Georgetown
Buytenzorg and Peradenya are, respectively, the pride of Java and
Ceylon, and have the reputation of being the finest botanical gardens in
the world ; yet the splendour of that of Georgetown alone is well worth
the voyage to Demerara. Nowhere in the world can one see a finer
assembly of tropical aquatic life than on these lagoons and canals.

180 J. Delacour--Notes of a Bird-lover in Tropical America
Certainly these collections of palms and orchids, these sumptuous
groups where one finds flora from all tropical countries mingled together,
are arranged with exquisite art and form a strange and magnificent park
of exuberant verdure and brilliant flowers, enlivened by Tyrants,
Tanagers, and other birds that are usually met with in Guiana. But
these canals and pools, filled with water lilies, lotus, and Victoria Regia,
and peopled with Manatees and Waders, appear to be from dreamland,
and in short reveal to us the true charm of the Guianas. Here are two
long canals which run on either side of a lovely straight and long
avenue, shaded by imposing palms and rare trees. As far as
one can see the Victoria Regia displays its immense leaves of over
two yards in diameter, with carmine edges upturned, and their great
scented flowers, red, pink, and white. The flowers of this strange plant
live for two days only, and change from pure white to sombre red.
The Victoria, native of a little lake in the interior of the colony, has
from there been dispersed in all the gardens of tropical countries, and
also introduced into our European hothouses. Its leaf is the largest
in existence. Here we come to a square pool starred with water lilies,
whose sky-blue flowers with bright yellow hearts uplift themselves
above the surface of the water ; further on there are acres of pink, white,
yellow, and variegated lotus, colossal tulips rising above their grey
green leaves, rising from the water to a height of over a yard. Then
other lakes filled with blue and pink water lilies, others with Nenuphar,
white or red. These orgies of aquatic flowers succeed each other
endlessly, and in the midst of all this beauty one admires the pretty
chestnut and black Jacanas, with their citron-colourecl wings, watching
over their grey chicks, whose feet, with length out of all proportion,
make one think of daddy-long-legs. The big Waterhen (Gallimda
galeala ),with its red beak and its frontal shield, and the little Porphyrios,
blue and green, walk about on the floating leaves, which are sometimes
disturbed by the plunging of a small alligator (Caiman). Islets of
entangled vegetation arise in the ponds ; they constitute the domain of
the Herons, which are protected there and peacefully pursue their
occupations under the eyes of the public. In March the Herons of
Demerara were nesting. During the day one only saw the sitting
birds, and the parents who came without ceasing to bring food to their

young, and a great number of nestlings, which, without being able to fly,
scrambled about awkwardly in the middle of the entangled branches.
Towards evening the whole colony returned from the seashore, where it
had passed the day feeding. Innumerable grey and white dots appeared
in the air and reassembled on the trees of the islets with raucous cries
and disputes. One cannot imagine what an interesting spectacle these
birds present, with their peculiar habits, irascible but sociable in their
colonial life. Four species inhabited the garden during my visit, the
little Egret (Egretta thula), the little blue and tricoloured Herons
(Florida coerulea and Hydranassa tricolor), and the violet Night Heron
(Nycticorax violaceus). In the larger pools big forms travel under the
water with strong movements. A Hindoo keeper throws in some grass
and whistles, and from the summit of a little Japanese bridge I see the
lotus plants yielding to the passage of some large aquatic animal. The
movements multiply and converge towards us, and then on the surface
of the muddy lake appeared a cowlike muzzle with broad nostrils
which opened and shut. A Manatee commences his repast, and is soon
accompanied by five or six others. The enormous rounded backs
appear on the surface ; they seemed to be made of old worn-out leather,
greyish brown in colour, and attaining a length of several yards. The
Manatees have been introduced into the pools of the Botanical Gardens
for some long time, and several generations have succeeded one another
there ; they increase, but not in considerable numbers. These great
aquatic mammals, still fairly abundant in the South American rivers,
are decreasing rapidly in numbers. In addition to which it is most
difficult to study them, for they never leave the water and are naturally
timid. The captives of Demerara are on the contrary very tame.
Amongst the waders mingle the curious Rostrliamus sociabilis, birds
of prey which feed upon shellfish; a very great number flew
from tree to tree, emitting sharp cries. These also had their nests in
March mixed with those of the Herons, who showed not the slightest
fear of them. During my stay at Demerara I used to return time after
time to the Garden, and I passed my last evening there ; before leaving
the South American continent I wished to see once more the Jacanas
dancing on the gigantic leaves of the Victoria Begia, and the Herons
flying over the pools starred with the blooms of the water lilies and
the lotus.

The creation in 1916 by the Zoological Society of New York of a
station for tropical research in British Guiana was an event of
considerable importance in the annals of Natural History. Nothing
analogous to it had up till then been attempted in Zoology.
Mr. William Beebe, Curator of Birds of the Zoological Park of New
York, had volunteered to serve in the Great War in France in the Flying
Corps, and when finally, after being disabled and passed as unfit for
further active service, he regretfully abandoned the&quot; battlefields, he was
appointed Director of the proposed Station of Tropical Research
and charged with its organization. Amongst his numerous publications,
Mr. Beebe has described to us the founding of the Kartabo Station,
and has kept us continuously interested in his thrilling work ; and more,
his graphic style has brought wonderfully to the minds of the inhabitants
of chilly Europe and of the States of North America the marvellous life
in the tropics, for Mr. Beebe has the pen of a scientist and of a writer.
It was, then, a real joy to me to accept the invitation which he sent
me, knowing that I was in his part of the world, to go and spend a few
days with him. From Georgetown, crossing the Demerara, &apos;and then
traversing the coastal district, one reaches the Essequibo. The majestic
river has the appearance of a sea, for the opposite bank (16 kilometres)
is hardly visible in the misty atmosphere which generally prevails in
the Guianas.
A steamer carried me, travelling up the great river, which does not
differ from other watercourses of the Guianas, except in its more vast
proportions. After some hours' navigation, we reached its confluence
with the Mazaruni, and, immediately after, the junction of that river
with the Cuyuni. The three vast currents appear to join at the same
point and to form a magnificent lake, surrounded by the giant forest.
Three promontories push themselves out; to the right is the Penal
Settlement, where one lands ; to the left Bartica Grove and Kalacoon,
the former seat of the Research Station ; and in front, on a sharp point
of land which separates the Mazaruni from the Cuyuni River, is Kartabo,
where the American naturalists now have their dwelling. The Research
Station is not luxuriously installed ; an old and simple colonial house,
encircled by its verandah and small tents, whilst all round grow giant

bamboos at least 100 feet high, and in front of the house there opens up
the splendid panorama of the confluence of the rivers, with the Essequibo
in the background. The house itself is used as a store, the verandah
as a laboratory and dining-room, and the tents as bedrooms.
But what an excellent situation for studying the fauna ; at the back
of the house a trail, which served as a path to a gold mine, pierces the
thick jungle ; a very few paces and one finds oneself in the heart of
nature in the midst of most strange creatures ; the rivers themselves
containing and enclosing all kinds of curious life.
The Director had as his companions naturalists who are experts in
their several branches, as well as artists for drawing and photographing
the birds and animals. The organization of this laboratory of the
virgin forest, where nothing but living or freshly-killed examples are
studied, does Mr. Beebe the very greatest credit and fills one with
admiration. Hard work is the rule at Kartabo, from 6 a.m. until
nightfall and even later, with little time for regular meals. The results
are remarkable ; all the living creatures of the region, from worms
to mammals, are captured, measured, drawn, photographed, and
thoroughly studied at all periods of their existence, being examined
most thoroughly from all aspects and from every possible point of view.
And thus the mystery of the tropical life of the Guianas is slowly
solved.
As far as the birds are concerned, Mr. Beebe has set himself the task
of observing their habits and of throwing light on the question of the
development of species of which little is known and which are most
interesting, such as the Hoatzin, the Toucans, the Trumpeters, the
Curassows, Tinamous, etc., etc.
I left Kartabo at the end of a week, enchanted with the cordial
welcome which I received, and with the fine work accomplished and
the excellent organization of the Research Station.
I wish all naturalists could go there ; for they would carry away an
exact idea of nature in the tropics, and would understand how it is
possible to establish a laboratory in the midst of the virgin forest,
to gather together scientists and artists, and there on the spot to
thoroughly study all the manifestations of life to be found.
One cannot too heartily congratulate the Zoological Society of New

(Continued from p. 101 .)
From San Francisco I visited the Sierra Nevada, chiefly for its
Wellingtonias and other wonderful conifers.
The first day I went by auto to Merced. At first the country was
hilly, but not wooded, and then it became flat and uninteresting,
except for the mass of small sunflowers that formed a yellow border
along the road. Scarcely any birds were visible.
I spent the night at Merced, and continued my travel next morning,
first to Miami Lodge, where I got some lunch. The road led
through a perfectly flat plain, the road being again bordered by sun-
flowers. Then gradually we got into low mountains with hardly any
vegetation, and then as we got higher, feathery blue pines and some oak-
trees became a feature of the landscape. The pines looked very delicate
with their slender long needles and white coloured shoots, and they
seemed to be unnaturally burdened by their enormous cones ( Finns
sahiniana). The oak-trees, which, I believe, were specimens of the blue
oak ( Quercus douglasii), stood separately, or in groups, and gave the
country a parklike aspect.
As we got higher we got into regular woods where the conifers
dominated. At first I saw specimens of Pinus fonderosa, then Lihocedrus,
Abies concolor, and last, not least, the wonderful Wellingtonias. These
big trees, I am sorry to say, are mostly labelled, in so far as they are
conspicuously fine ones, and I was not a little disgusted at finding a
label with " General Grant " on one, and General Somebody Else on a
second one, etc., etc. The shock to my feelings was, perhaps, only
surpassed by that occasioned by all the dirt and filth left by camping
individuals at the foot of those wonders of creation. The auto is
probably considered as a blessing by most Americans, but it certainly
has taken away a great deal of the beauty of the American landscape.

The evening found me at Wawona, where I was to spend a couple of
days. Wawona is an hotel, and it is surrounded by glorious trees
of the conifer family, which, however, are treated with but scant respect.
There is a stream not very far from the hotel, and on the stones that
emerged out of the water I saw again a specimen of Sayornis nigricans,
which was busy catching insects. Near the river was some low brush-
wood that was partly fenced, for some purpose or other, and on that
fence my sight was gladdened by a family of plumed or painted Quails
(Callipepla picta), which are called Mountain quails, I believe, by the
inhabitants. The painted Quail is a rare bird in captivity in Europe,
and I was extremely glad to see it in its native haunts.
A Red Finch, somewhat shaped like a big Linnet ( Carpodacus mexi-
canus frontalis), and called there the House Finch, was rather a common
bird. T also met one single male example of the Bluebird ( Scalia wilsoni),
and once or twice a little Yellow Warbler. In a thin wood, against a
mountain, I met a family of Steller's Jays, the parents busy feeding their
fully fledged offspring. .Steller's Jay is a most beautiful bird. It is blue
with a black crested head, which is again ornamented by a metallic blue
front. A little farther I also came across a family of Californian Blue
Jays, which are crestless and have a whitish throat. Blue Jays of the
different species are conspicuous birds in the Western States, as they
have very little fear of man, and they certainly contribute much to the
embellishment of the woods. Sitting on the ground against the slope
of a small cut in the mountain, I again saw a couple of plumed Quails
that were hiding under bushes only a few yards distant.
I also met a few times a small black and white Woodpecker with
scarlet head &apos;and upper breast. There are admirable trees in the
immediate neighbourhood of the Wawona hotel. Not forty yards away
from it is a splendid old specimen of Libocedrus decurrens. The bark of
old trees of this species grows heavy folds and is of a red colour, and
the whole tree reminds one very much of a Wellingtonia on a smaller
scale.
Near the river are some striking specimens of Finns lambertiana. A
peculiarity of this pine is that its top branches are of irregular or
unequal length, so that it resembles a spruce of which the branches
would be almost horizontal and unequal in length. The cones are

long and of enormous size (13-18 inches long). There were also close
by beautiful examples of Pinus ponderosa, the finest one standing near
the pigsties. This noble tree had been used as a stile to fasten a gate
to, and for that purpose had simply been cut flat on one side ! ! What-
ever I admire in America it is not the way that some of the Americans
treat their trees ! After my trip in the Sierra Nevada., I went back to
San Francisco, and then went north to Eureka in the Humboldt Basin ,
to see the redwoods on the Eel River.
East, in Washington City, I had been told that I would find redwood
forests ( Sequoya sempervirens) near San Francisco. It took, however,
over 12 hours by rail to get to Eureka, and from there three or four
hours by auto to get to really good forests of redwoods on the Eel river.
In Eureka one of the roads was full of tall grasses that bore seed. In
it, feeding on the grass seed, were flocks of Siskins, old birds with families
of young ones. The old males were yellowish green with a black cap.
In the redwood forest the first bird I saw was a Steller's Jay that
hopped fearlessly around us.
These woods, which showed a wealth of splendid ferns, and in which
a specimen of redwood was shown me that had 21 feet diameter,
the birds were unfortunately extremely scarce, and I only noted there
a Blackish Wren and small Grey Plovers along the river side, whilst
a bird of prey, apparently a Pandion, hovered over it at some distance.
A family of ducks, following the course of the river, flew at too
great a distance to be identified.
From Eureka I went back to San Francisco, and then travelled north
by railroad to Seattle. This takes about two days and two nights, and
on the way one has a fine view of Mount Shasta, which is, I believe,
14,000 feet high and has snow on it. Seattle has a fine situation on
Pucjett Sound, and one of the commonest birds there is Turdus
migratorius, which even in the vegetable market hopped fearlessly
amongst the visitors.
In Woodland Park is a small zoological collection, fine Bison and
Wapiti being of course included. In the woods I noticed small birds
of the Jackdaw family. They looked much like a Jackdaw, but were
slightly more elongated, and had no grey neck feathers. The voice,
however, resembled closely that of our Jackdaw.

From Seattle I made a trip to Mount Rainier, which mountain,
with its surroundings, is a national park. The trip was done by auto-
mobile, and the first stage was to Long mire Springs, which is situated
at 2,700 feet altitude. At first, after leaving Seattle, the Douglas firs
which had been my almost constant companions after I had passed
Mount Shasta on my way to Seattle, were again conspicuous, but after
a while, as we got into the mountains, the forest became mixed, and I
saw splendid examples of the Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), also
Giant thuyas, Abies amabilis, Abies nobilis, and some Abies grandis.
In the forest I noticed a specimen of the Golden Winged Woodpecker,
but of the Western form. This form appears to be a little larger than
the true Colaptes auratus of the Eastern States, and is conspicuously
different by having red instead of golden feather shafts in the wings
(Colaptes cafer collaris).
At Longmire Springs is an hotel where I spent the night, and next
morning, under the kind guidance of Professor Flet, who is ranger of
the park, I had a delightful walk up the mountains. Before starting
we saw a couple of Black-tailed deer in a low meadow near the hotel, and
in the trees near, several brown, black, and white Tits (Partes rufescens)
were very active searching the branches of a fir-tree for insects. Our
walk led us through splendid forests, chiefly composed of Abies amabilis,
Abies nobilis, and Abies grandis, whilst the Douglas firs did not follow us
so far up. As we got still higher we met specimens of Tsuga mertensiana,
Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, and near the snow-line little groups of
Abies lasiocarpa were conspicuous by the spire-shaped crowns of the
single trees. In these woods we came across a mountain form of Turdus
migratorius, which is conspicuous by a black band across its red breast.
We also saw a Pine squirrel, which is grey, with yellowish eyebrows and
belly. As we had passed out of the forest and had reached an alpine
meadow full of most beautiful flowers, we rested on a heap of loose
stones, and whilst we were sitting there a little creature like a small
dark grey rabbit without a tail, with small rounded ears and beautiful
black eyes, emerged from the ramble and watched us curiously,
without showing any fear. It was what was called locally a " coney of
the stones " or " little chief hare " (Ochotona princeps), and when it had
examined us to its satisfaction it quickly re-entered its stone fortress !

Next day 1 went forward and backward to Paradise Valley, which is
situated at 5,557 feet, and there made a walk over part of the glacier.
The scenery was extremely beautiful, but hardly any living creature was
seen. In fact, I cannot remember having seen a single bird !
In the immediate neighbourhood of Seattle is a narrow wooded
canyon, with a small stream at the bottom of it, which is (sailed Roosevelt
Park. As it is rather damp there, the vegetation is luxurious, and this
again attracts birds. In it I saw a Robin ( Turdus migratorius) feeding
its young with the scarlet berries of an aralia that was very common
there (Fatsia horrida). The young Robins differed from the adults
by being spotted on the head and back, and by not having the red of
the underside so well marked. I also noticed a small brown Wren
(probably Troglodytes liiemalus pad ficus), and once or twice a small
Thrush, resembling our Songthrush on a small scale. Songsparrows,
or cousins of theirs, were often seen running along the ground amongst
the rank vegetation, and I once saw a little brown bird that in shape
and behaviour reminded me exactly of a female European Redstart.
With a kind American friend who served as my guide, I made a second
excursion to Mount Rainier Nat. Park, exploring another part of it, and
keeping in the forest and the lower parts near the river. As we took
our lunch on the borders of a clear stream, an affluent of the Whitewater,
I noticed a large slaty grey Waterousel with striped upperside and
yellowish throat, that was fearlessly diving, swimming, and running in
the clear stream in pursuit of insects, and later on in the day I saw a
second one in the Whitewater itself. On our way home we passed some
cultivated country, and there, sitting on a pole, I saw a large Meadow
Lark staring at us as we rushed past in the auto. This is a large bird;
above, greyish brown, and yellow 7 below, with a black crescent on the
breast ( Siurnella magna), and although considered to be a common bird,
it is the only one of its kind that I saw. In that same region I saw a few
times a large Groundfinch with black head, black upperside with wdiite
streaks, white underside with rufus sides, which instantly hid himself
at my approach under the bushes or weeds ( Pipilo maculatus).
As we neared Belle Vue, a suburb of Seattle on the opposite side of
Lake Washington. I noticed splendid Madrona-trees ( Arbutus menziesi),
and on a fence, round a garden, a male Californian Crested Colin quietly
saw us pass.

For many years I have made a special study of the keeping of Scrub
Birds, such as Regents, Satins, Cat, Pittas, and Spotted Bower-birds,
besides a collection from New Guinea consisting of five varieties of
Birds of Paradise, Manucode, Spotted Cat-bird (two different varieties),
the large and the small about the size of a Pigeon, Pitta, and two
varieties of Bower-birds, the grey which is a good mimic, and the Golden
Crested, and numerous Pigeons. In the early part of last spring my
Cat-birds (AElurcedus viridis) were very active and started chasing the
other birds in the aviary; the two hen Cat-birds fought, with the result
that one was killed, so I caught the pair and placed them in a small
aviary about 15 ft. by 6 ft. by 7 ft. In it I placed a little dried bush
and fixed a small wire fern basket in the corner, gave them some nesting
material, dried grass, twigs, and sticks. Before a fortnight they had
constructed a very neat bowl-shaped nest lined with a few feathers.
The first egg was laid on 6th September, the second egg two days later.
They both sat very patiently, the cock relieving the hen whilst she
came off to eat. After sitting for about three weeks I became impatient
and tested one of the eggs, which was fertile; the other one was clear.
After the first failure they laid again in December; the young hatched
in 29 days and only lived for 10 days owing to the shortage of animal
and insectivorous food, mealworms being unobtainable. Doomed to
disappointment, I intended returning them to the large flight aviary
when I noticed that they started adding leaves and twigs to their nest.
This time I am pleased to relate that they reared their young.
Unfortunately they left the nest too soon: one perished during a heavy
storm, the other is over six months old and is exceptionally tame,
will feed out of your hand, and will allow itself to be fondled. The
young were fed on mealworms (which they killed and prepared),
plain soaked bread, apples, and bananas. The cock was very attentive
during incubation. He carried food to the hen whilst sitting, and did
most of the feeding after the young left the nest.
The coloration of the young is of a bluish green, darker than the
parents, the eyes black, changing after six months.

The abnormal weather which prevailed in Normandy through the
spring and summer (tropical heat in May, and cold and rainy days
throughout June, July, and August) has been very prejudicial to bird
breeding, and I have nothing to report among
the small birds but
failures ; even the Doves,
generally so prolific,
have only hatched a
few young ones. With
Pheasants, Waterfowls, and
other larger
birds the results have been
a little better, though
many casualties took
place owing to the low temperature.

A few other small birds have bred in
the aviaries
, but
as I did
know how many there were before, I cannot give the number reared.
Most of the small birds, Doves and Parrakeets, which usually breed
freely here, have not even gone to nest, as a result, I think, of the
unusually cold summer. A Queen Parrakeet sat for a month in her
" grandmother's clock nest box " but never laid one egg. Many
young Ducks and Pheasants have been lost, because many of my
bantam hens refused to sit; this is another very strange fact which
occurred to many aviculturists last year ; I was then obliged to put
the eggs under big hens (Wyandottes, Sussex, or Rhode Islands), which
trod on and killed the young ones; some even murdered them
deliberately; such has been the case with broods of Temminck's
Tragopans, Siamese Firebacks, Carolina and Mandarin Ducks !
As is shown in the above list, I only bred a few species of Waterfowl,
though I possess a fairly large and complete collection. This is due to
the fact that having lost last year most of my breeding Ducks (eaten
by an otter which had got into the park and killed over fifty) I had to
buy new birds, most of them bred in 1921 ; and one knows that most
Waterfowl do not breed before their second or even third year, and
become more prolific as they become older. Also I always lose eggs
laid in the park that I cannot find ; they are destroyed by crows and
vermin. I hope for better results in 1923, as I have been able to
complete my collection with rarer species such as Ringed, Cinnamon,
and Brazilian Teal, Bahamas, White Eyes, Crested Pochards, Sparsa
Ducks, etc. I had bad luck with the Black-necked Swans : the female

was disturbed from her nest and died a few days after. The Cereopsis
laid as usual in the middle of the winter, and their eggs were frozen.
I have five strong young Rheas, from a white cock and a grey hen ;
they all had white patches on the head when newly hatched, but now
are all grey ; I hope, anyhow, that, later on, some females of these,
put with another white cock, will produce all white young ones. It is
worth noting that two white cocks run about the park with two grey
hens, and that there is very little fighting between them in the spring ;
that does not prevent them breeding and sitting well.

<bodyText confidence="0.999333818181818" page_id="32671100"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
The Council propose to grant medals to the Duchess of Wellington
for breeding the Ornate Tanager (Tanagra ornata), and to Mr. Herbert
Bright for breeding the White-breasted Ground Pigeon ( Phlogoenas
jobiensis ), accounts of which have now been published, providing that
no member or reader knows of a previous instance of either, in which
case they would be glad to have particulars. They would like to point
out that Tanagra ornata and Tanagra episcopus are names that have
sometimes been applied to the same species, although the two are really
quite distinct. Tanagra ornata was formerly called the " Archbishop
Tanager " in the list of the Zoological Society, although this name is
more properly applied to Tanagra episcopus.
