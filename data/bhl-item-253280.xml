One of my most enjoyable annual writing assignments is com-
piling a review of zoos and bird gardens in Britain for two IPC
publications, CAGE &amp; AVIARY BIRDS and BIRD KEEPER. The
theory each year is that the people in charge will mail or fax me the
latest news of what is happening in their particular collection.
However, in about 70% of cases, theory is not translated into
fact and I invariably have to spend the better part of two or three
days telephoning around Britain for information needed urgently to
meet editorial deadlines.
It is always a rewarding exercise - hearing of new arrivals and
interesting breedings, and perhaps most of all of people's hopes and
ambitions for another new season.
There are some quite excellent public collections in the UK and
they share many interesting exhibits. Sadly there is an understand-
able reluctance on the part of many to provide details of species
known to be especially vulnerable to that modern predator, the bird
thief.
But thieves are unlikely to trouble two new arrivals at The
National Birds of Prey Centre at Newent in Gloucestershire. A
juvenile pair of Steller's Sea Eagles Haliaeetus pelagicus arrived
there a few weeks ago from Moscow. With a spectacular pair of
Martial Eagles Polemaetus bellicosus already in the collection,
Director Jemima Parry-Jones now has a formidable 'big two'.
At Pensthorpe Waterfowl Park in Norfolk, wildfowl enthusiasts
can admire a number of rarities - Pink-eared Duck Malacorhynchus
membranaceus , Harlequin Duck Histrionicus histrionicus and Freck-
led Duck Stictonetta naevosa to name but three.
Australian Brush Turkeys Alectura lathami are an interesting
feature in the collection at Lotherton Hall Bird Gardens in York-
shire, while across the Pennines in Lancashire a breeding group of
Western Slender-billed Corellas Cacatua pastinator are a
highlight.

Spectacular exhibits at Flamingo Gardens and Zoological Park
are large groups of several species of pelicans (three species were
incubating recently). In conversation with Christopher Marler a
few weeks ago, he confirmed that he hoped soon to have all eight
of the world's pelican species in the park in the near future.
There are other interesting and unusual birds held in British
collections - Roadrunner Geococcyx californina at Banham in
Norfolk, where a first UK breeding of the species has been achieved.
In Berkshire there are 20 species of laughing thrushes in Beale
Park's collection where more than 70 young birds have been reared
successfully during the past three years.
The Avicultural Society has a number of members who are much
involved with the running of some of these establishments, either
as Curators, in other staff posts or, in some instances, as owners.
There is almost certainly a zoo or bird garden within reasonable
travelling distance of most UK members. Many are regular visitors
- others turn up less frequently. If you are part of the latter group,
let me persuade you that you don't know what you are missing.
People such as Council Members Roger Wilkinson (Chester Zoo)
and Mike Curzon (Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode), and Peter Player
of Flimwell Bird Park in Sussex, would certainly confirm that!

Parakeet Auklets Cyclorrhynchus psittacula, were collected as
chicks on St. Lawrence Island in 1993, for the Cincinnati Zoo. The
burrows in which the Parakeets nested were well dispersed along
the talus slopes and cliffs and offered protection from predators
such as Arctic Fox Alopex lagopus. The Parakeet chicks were
reared in artificial burrows and adapted to being fed Krill Euphausia
superba and Sand Eels Ammodytes hexapterus. A mean weight of
216 gr. was obtained at fledging while food intake decreased to
28% of body mass, at that time, from amounts of over 40% in ages
estimated up to 15 days. Measurements and weights were recorded
on the sub-adults (N=22) at one year of age; mean weight: 236 gr.,
measurements, mean wing span: 48.6 cm and mean length: 26.0 cm
First year plumage varies from 30% of the colony transforming into
typical adult plumage, 50% intermediate transformation and 20%
remaining in the typical juvenile form.
Introduction
Alcidae are distinguished among charadriiforms by their com-
pact form, short wings and feeding habits (Cones, 1868),
Cyclorrhynchus are further defined by the reduction of the lateral
sternal notch to a fenestra, six costal processes on the sternum and
nesting in natural crevices (Strauch, 1985).
In this monotypic genus the Parakeet Auklet, once known as
&quot;paroquet&quot;, is found. The sexes of this species are alike marked by
seasonal variations. During the breeding season this auklet&apos;s head
is sooty black with mottled whitish throat and foreneck. A yellow-
ish auricular streak runs from the eye to the ear. The sooty black
colour continues onto the upper back with the underparts being
mostly white, while the transitional areas of the breast and flank are
mottled gray. The tail is black and the bill is upturned and red.
Non-breeding plumage changes to a mottled white area on the chin
and throat while the bill becomes a dull brownish-red (Harrison,

1983). The chicks have down that is very fleecy and dense. This
down ranges in length from 7 mm in the capital tract to 16 mm on
the dorsal region. The iris is black and the bill is grey with a white
egg tooth on the upper mandible. At 30 days of age the chicks have
obtained the white superciliary line from the eye to the ear,
although the feathers are not elongated. The iris has become bluish
grey and the bill is pale black with a yellow mouth cavity (Bedard
&amp; Sealy, 1984).
The range of the Parakeet Auklet overlaps that of the Least
Auklet Aethia pusiila and the Crested Auklet A. cristatella. In
Russia these birds are reported to breed on seashore cliffs and in the
winter wander the seas, keeping clear of frozen seas. Parakeet
Auklets breed along the shores of the Chukotskiy and Kamachatka
Peninsulas, the Sea of Okhotsk, Commander and Kuril Island. In
winter it can reach Japan. The breeding range continues along Cape
Lisburne on the Bering Strait south through the Bering Sea includ-
ing St. Lawrence, Pribilof and Aleutian Islands, then east through
the Kodiak archipelago as far as Prince William Sound (Freethy,
1987). Parakeet Auklets nest deep within the rubble of talus slopes
and in cracks and crevices on rocky shorelines or cliffs. The
colonial tendency is seemingly less strong than in other Auklets.
The pairs nest in scattered groups or in solitary pairs (Sowls et al,
1978). In each nest a solitary white egg is laid (Peterson, 1961).
These auklets avoid strong pycnocline gradients, thus are pre-
sumed to have greater diving abilities than the Least Auklet
(Haney, 1991). This conclusion may need further study since
gelatinous zooplankton (e.g., jellyfish and ctenophores) is an
important part of the Parakeet Auklet&apos;s diet and probably are their
preferred foods. The primary reason for feeding on jellyfish may
be the high nutritive value of associated crustaceans and fish
larvae; hyperiid amphipods and fish larvae are easily observed on
and around jellyfish in the surface waters (Harrison, 1990). These
items are important to the auklet along with other seabirds due to
the fact that they have a unique capacity for assimilating wax esters
with higher efficiences (&gt;90%) than that attainable by mammals
(&lt;50%) (Place, 1992). The Parakeet Auklet&apos;s bill is highly special-
ized and unusual in that the lower mandible is a narrow hook that
curves up and around the blunt mandible, suggesting these birds
hook gelatinous animals or pick zooplankton from medusae/jelly-
fish (Harrison, 1990).
Parakeet Auklets also occur in areas of the eastern Bering Sea
where Least and Crested Auklets are absent (Bedard, 1969). Par-

akcet Auk Jets consistently had larger reserves of subcutaneous fat
than the other Aethia species. Parakeets display less annual
variation in breeding success and would appear to have a depend-
able supply of food (Harrison, 1990). The Parakeets also have been
observed to have less mortality due to predation by fox than other
auklet species. While the Least and Parakeets were nesting in the
same area of St. Lawrence, Leasts were observed being taken by
one pair of Arctic Fox at a rate of up to 10 per hour during daylight
hours, while the parakeet Auklets remained undisturbed (Drischman,
1993 ).

In August 1993, staff members of the Cincinnati Zoo and
Wildlife Concepts International set up collecting operations, of the
Parakeet Auklet, in the village of Savoonga (63*42'N, 170*30'W)
on St. Lawrence Island. Seabirds were observed along Punelok Bay
and on Cape Myaughee where the colonies had been estimated at up
to 100,000 birds and 1,000,000 birds respectively (Sowls, et al
1978). Collection of 28 juvenile birds began on 20th August 1993
and were held in Savoonga until the departure date of 25th August.
All chicks were hand fed krill Euphausia superba four times a day.
Transport of the birds to Cincinnati was accomplished through
air charters and commercial flights which hastened the journey and
limited the time that each bird had to remain in the crates. Once the
birds arrived at the zoo they were placed in brooders within a
specially prepared holding facility where further observations were
made on growth patterns by taking daily weights, morphology
changes through photo-documentation, daily food intake by re-
cording items ingested until each bird fledged and behaviour
patterns through daily observations and video documentation.

The Parakeet Auklet nests were found by climbing down over
the cliffs of the colonies and searching crevices by hand or with
flashlights. Nest-sites were discovered above the tide line at the
base of the cliffs up to the top of the ridge. Unlike the other auklet
species encountered, the Parakeet Auklets did not nest in large
numbers in any one area, preferring to disperse their numbers along
larger tracts. The typical nest found on the cliff face was a cavity
large enough to accommodate the auklet&apos;s body size and provide
security by having a chamber up to one meter in length. Occupancy
of a cavity was foretold by a small amount of &quot;white wash&quot; at the
entrance and the accumulation of feather sheaths, from the chick's

feathers as they opened, which formed a grey dust along the burrow
floor. Nest-sites within the boulder rubble were more difficult to
locate, due to the many crevices formed by the mass of rocks. In
these areas the nest size was comparable to t he cavities found along
the cliff face although the preferred sites usually had one entrance
that branched off into several diverging tunnels. Observed mortal-
ity within the colony could only be attributed to rock slides
trapping adults within the nest cavity, no evidence of predation was
noted.
Once the chicks were removed from the nests, they were taken
to the holding facility in Savoonga to be maintained until their
extraction to Cincinnati. Each chick was housed in separate
compartments that remained darkened. An ambient temperature of
45*to 55* F + - 5 degrees surrounded the crates for the duration of
this period. Each chick was tubed with a pureed mixture of krill
four times a day. After several days the chicks began to take whole
krill by hand and the tubing was discontinued.

Upon collection, each chick was placed in an individual com-
partment of a holding crate for hand-rearing. Ambient temperature
was maintained at 55*F + - 5 and moss collected and dried from the
surrounding area used as a substrate. Initial food intake was offered
via a feeding tube with a formula of krill (placed through a blender
until liquefied) four times a day over a twelve hour period. The
average age of the chicks at the time of collection was estimated at
12 days. The chicks quickly tamed down and began to take krill by
hand within two days of being collected, the morning feeding of
blended krill continued (See Table 1).
The holding facility in Cincinnati was readied prior to receiving
the alcids from St. Lawrence. Brooders were constructed measur-
ing 4ft x 8ft divided into eight equal 1ft x 4ft sections with an open
top and lin welded wire bottom. Within each section two cardboard
boxes, one foot square and waxed on the inside, were placed in the
centre dividing the section into two areas. The cardboard boxes had
a three-inch hole cut in the front and a flap cut in the top to be used
as a lid. Medical (disposable) underpads were used to absorb any
faecal matter not ejected through the entrance of the artificial
burrow. The holding facility was maintained at 55*F and the air was
constantly filtered, removing all particles larger than three mi-
crons. The water system utilized UV sterilizer units, a cooling
system that regulated the water at 45* F and a filtration system of
Jacuzzi, DE and Zeolite filters. A rate of three gallons of water per

minute was injected into the thousand-gallon pool to create on
overflow to reduce surface oils. Lighting was achieved through
eight banks of 400 watt sodium vapour and metal halite fixtures and
controlled via a timer that maintained the bird's natural photoperiod
throughout the year.
A morning weight was taken on each chick and the four feedings
per day continued along with the addition of Sand Eels Ammondytes
hexapterus and vitamin supplements to the diet. The chicks were
weaned onto a regimen of eating whole krill and fish placed on a
plate within the entrance of the box. The process of eating off a
plate began as the chicks approached 18 days of age and food intake
was monitored closely. Based on body mass, the highest rate of
food consumption was obtained within the first 15 days of age.
Chicks would ingest between 31% to 45% of their body weight in
food, up to 15 days of age and the quantity decreased to its lowest
point prior to fledging at 23% (See Table 2). As the juvenile birds
advanced toward 30 days of age and fledging they would begin to
spend time at the entrance of the box or venture outside of the box
entrance. Upon fledging the juvenile birds' appetites increased and
they were consuming 28% of their body weight in food per day.
Rocks were introduced into the brooders to allow the birds access
to a substrate other than wire.
After the plumage was completely developed and the chicks'
down feathers were replaced, the birds were introduced to open
water. The first three days of the introduction occurred for periods
of six to seven hours and then the birds would be placed back into
the brooders at night. Once it was observed that an individual was
waterproofed and acclimating well to the new surroundings the bird
would remain out in the main section of the enclosure. Food plates
were place in the shallow portion of the pool allowing the birds,
which spent a large amount of time in the water, to become
proficient at finding their food before the plates were relocated on
the deck area. Blocks of frozen krill were floated on the water to
allow the juvenile birds to forage in a more natural manner. The
Parakeets showed less propensity for diving than the other alcid
species housed in the enclosure at that time (Least Auklets, Pigeon
Guillemots, Horned Puffin and Tufted Puffin) and further investi-
gation of feeding techniques of these birds will be forthcoming.
As the birds matured, smaller and more numerous food plates
were distributed around the enclosure to reduce the increasing
amount of competition that developed. This competition coincided
with the increased photoperiod and the onset of what would normal-

ly be the breeding season. While no breeding did occur in these
sub-adults, there was increased usage of burrows (six inch PVC
tubes) and pair bonds were established between several pairs.
Defence of burrows and individuals bringing food back and feeding
the other within the pair was observed.

The development of the Parakeet Auklets was recorded through
a photographic register at intervals of 90 days. Colour bands on
each individual&apos;s leg aided in tracking the general progress within
the colony.
At an estimated age of 30 to 35 days, the chicks had lost all of
their natal down, the last remaining portions being on the head and
nape. At this point the plumage was developed sufficient for
survival on the open water. The white superciliary line from the
eye to the ear had been acquired but the elongated feathers were not
observed until 90 days of age, as the birds underwent a partial
moult. During this period of development the bluish grey iris of
each chick changed to a pale yellow colour. The juvenile plumage
pattern consisted of a moderate grey tone over most of the head and
a light white to pallid grey under the chin and over the region of the
nape toward the back. The breast and throat were solid white and
the mandibles varied in standard although all were black with
cream colour markings.
At eight months of age a portion of the colony began to obtain
plumage similar to that of mature adults. The white mottled throat
and chin with the mottled grey continuing around to the nape began

to transform into the dark black chin, nape and head. Along with
these changes came the transformation of the mandibles from
complete black with diminutive cream colour markings to the
reddish-orange found in the adults. By 11 months there was, in the
22 birds, a marked deviation in the sub-adult plumage. At this age
30% of the Parakeet Auklets had developed plumage that included
the above mentioned reddish-orange bill and black head, chin and
nape. The remaining birds could be placed into two categories;
50% of the total colony developed partial adult patterns i.e. upper
anterior portion of the mandible acquiring an orange colour and
partial development of a dark head, chin and nape, while the
remaining 20% retained the juvenile paradigm.
Wing span and length (point of mandible to termination of the
tail) measurements were recorded on each bird at one year of age.
The wing span of the auklets ranged from 45.7 cm to 50.8 cm with
a mean of 48.6 cm. The length measurements ranged from 22.2. cm
to 25.5 cm with a mean length of 26.0 cm.

Parakeet Auklets were found to establish their nest-sites in less
concentration than other auklets species on St. Lawrence Island.
This dispersion, coupled with the inaccessibility of the cliffs or
boulder rubble, emerge as one possibility for the lower mortality
observed due to predation.
By emulating the nutrient-rich portions of their diet, zooplankton
and fish, rearing of the Parakeet Auklet in a captive situation
became possible. Artificial burrows provide a stable and secure
environment for the chicks to develop and allowed for natural
feeding behaviour until the time of fledging. Food consumption
ranged from up to 45% of body mass per day at 8 to 15 days of age
to 23% of body mass 2 to 3 days prior to fledging. This decrease
in appetite probably coincides with a decrease in food offered by
the adults at that time. A temperature range at or near 55* F was well
suited for these birds once they left the protective accommodation
within the brooders. By providing food items in the water the
fledglings quickly recognised the objects from which to feed and
were then self sufficient. Fledglings were ingesting greater amount
of food at 30 days of age (28%) in comparison to body mass when
compared to the days leading up to this event.
The morphological transformation of the Parakeet Auklet was
tracked through the first year of maintaining the species at the
Cincinnati Zoo. The development of the elongated feathers of the
superciliary line from the eye to the ear along with the change in

eye colouration from bluish grey to pale yellow occurred at approx-
imately ninety days of age. Sub-adult plumage was developed by
eight months of age. 30 % of the colony were represented by adult
plumage consisting of black sooty head colouration, black chin and
nape along with transformation of the mandibles from the black and
cream colour pattern to the reddish-orange colour typified by the
adults. 50 % of the colony developed partial adult patterns exhib-
iting orange colouration on the top anterior portion of the mandible
and development of an intermediate transformation to a slightly
darker head, nape and chin. The remaining 20% showed no
deviation in plumage pattern or mandible modification. Further
study into the diverging variety of plumage demonstrated by first
year birds is needed in order to understand the Parakeet&apos;s life
history. By one year of age, the birds had developed full body mass
and size, exhibiting a mean weight of 256 grams and dimensions of
an average 48.6 cm wing span and 26.0 cm length from the point of
the mandibles to the terminating point of the tail.
Behavioural patterns consistent with that of adult breeding birds
were demonstrated in an immature manner during the first breeding
season. Mutual feeding, defence of territory/cavities and increased
aggression was all observed within the colony. Clearly Parakeet
Auklets are not mature enough in the development to breed at one
year of age.
By collecting juvenile birds, it has become possible to maintain
the Parakeet Auklet in a captive situation. Information on hand-
rearing, first year morphology and juvenile behaviour patterns
have been documented, while further studies regarding feeding
techniques and breeding are now possible.

A BRIEF HISTORY.
By P. J. Wisniewski and A. Wooldridge
The Falkland Islands Flightless Steamer Duck Tachyeres
brachypterus is a large, sexually dimorphic coastal duck endemic
to the Falkland Islands. The term &quot;flightless&quot; is a slight misnomer
as they can fly low over the water but never attain any height. Wild
birds breed from September to December usually in tussock grass
or abandoned burrows. Outside the breeding season they may be
found in pairs, family parties or larger flocks. They feed by
upending or diving, usually at sea but occasionally in freshwater
pools. They are extremely aggressive, especially the more mas-
sively built drakes. Captive breeding of this species has been
achieved irregularly with few published records (Gewalt, 1968;
Schmidt, 1969).
The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust centre at Martin Mere near
Burscough, Lancashire has had a long association with the Falkland
Island Flightless Steamer Duck and the following account provides
a brief history of the species in captivity at this centre.
The First Pair
During 1974 the first pair arrived at Martin Mere. These were
captive-bred individuals originating from adults hatched from the
wild collected eggs during the 1960&apos;s and maintained at the Wild-
fowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge. These were housed in a pen
measuring 15 x 5m and comprising 60% land and 40% water. The
land area consisted mostly of grass with a small group of bushes
close to the water. They were fed on a diet identical to that used at
Slimbridge i.e. Beta dried dog food and trout pellets. The birds
appeared to settle well but the female expired after seven months
from visceral gout. The drake died after twelve months; an x-ray
had revealed a metal staple in his gut and the bird did not recover
from an operation to remove it. Post mortem revealed amyloidosis
of the kidneys. The latter condition and the visceral gut observed
in the female may have indicated too high a protein content in the
diet. The swallowing of foreign bodies as observed in the drake is
a common phenomenon and has been reported as a cause of death
in other collections, presumably because these birds are used to
swallowing hard objects i.e. shellfish, Crustacea in the wild.

The Second Pair

<bodyText confidence="0.980943292682927" page_id="56270520"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
During 1977 a second pair of Steamer Ducks arrived at Martin
Mere, one being a Slimbridge-bred bird and the other from
Wuppertal. Both were approximately two years old on arrival.
These were housed in a lens shaped pen 26m long and 7.5m at its
widest point with water at the front and a rocky area at the back
sloping down to a pebbled area. Barrels were installed under rock
caves to provide breeding sites similar to those used by eiders. This
time the diet was altered to a mix of Beta dried dog food plus SDS
Maintenance Pellet.
The drake was always very dominant and the first to come to
food. He was also extremely aggressive with the female prior to the
breeding season (in February and March in Britain) and the female
had to be removed on several occasions to prevent damage. At the
end of the breeding season (late March to April) the female could
safely be put back with the drake as he no longer showed any
interest in her. This lack of satisfactory pair bonding may have
been a result of the birds being put together at too advanced an age
(2 years old) and possibly to differences in rearing techniques for
the two individuals. Later observations suggest that pairs need to
be formed before birds reach one-year old for successful bonding.
In 1979 the drake was found drowned (at an approximate age of
four years). Subsequent post-mortem revealed a catalogue of
problems including aspergillosis (see also Schmidt, 1969),
cyathostomiasis, Acuaria and atherosclerosis. The female died in
1980 (five years old) from enteritis.
The First Breeding
In autumn of 1982 two pairs of Steamer Ducks arrived from
Slimbridge where they had been bred in the spring of that year.
The first pair ('A' &amp; 'B') were put into the pen used by the
previous pair from 1977 - 80. The second pair ('C' &amp;'D') were
released onto the large South American Lake which measured 60m
by 100m and also housed a flock of Chilean Flamingos
Phoenicopterus chilensis x Muscovy Duck Cairina moschata, Red-
billed Whistling Duck Dendrocygna autumnalis, Bahama Pintail
Anas bahamensis a Chiloe Wigeon A. sibilatrix\ Argentine Red
Shoveler A, platalea x Rosybill Netta peposaca a Brazilian Teal
Amazonetta brasiliensis A and Ringed Teal Callonetta leucophrys.
A new pen was ready for the Steamers by April 1983 but during the
intervening period they had killed about half a dozen birds, mostly
Ringed Teal and Bahama Pintail. The new pen measured 16m by
24m and again consisted of a large pool with rocky backdrop and

pebble shore. (Diet comprised SDS, Diet A.) The birds did not
settle well in the new pen as it was adjacent to the large area that
they once occupied and on several occasions one or both birds
would leave the pen despite their "flightlessness"
The answer was to swap the two pairs around so that 'C' and
'D'were no longer adjacent to the South American Lake and this
solved the problem.
In 1986 the female C D' laid the first eggs. The birds had been
provided with several potential nest sites and eventually nested in
a plastic barrel covered with turf on an island. The first egg was laid
on 4 April and a total of eight were produced. An egg was collected
every other day while the female was away from the nest and each
replaced with a wooden egg. The clutch was placed under a
domestic goose but when candled after twelve days all proved to be
clear. The dummy eggs were subsequently replaced by three
European Eider Somateria mollissima eggs. Some aviculturalists
would disagree with this practice but we felt it to be important for
first-time breeders to have something to rear in order to gain
experience. We feel that this is particularly important for single
pairs in side pens where they are not stimulated by the sight and
sound of the other birds.
Experience has also shown that where eggs are taken from pairs
of waterfowl year after year and allowed nothing to rear then they
tend to cease laying. This female Steamer subsequently reared two
young eider ducks.
The next egg was laid on 23 March 1987 again by female 'D' and
the final egg of the clutch on 8 April. In total nine eggs were laid
with periods of two to three days between eggs. All eggs were
removed to the duckery where they were turned twice daily. No
suitable foster parents were available so the first five eggs were
placed in a moving air incubator shortly followed by the remaining
four. After four days the eggs were candled revealing that the fifth
egg to be laid was addled. The first four eggs were then placed
under a broody hen. Of the remaining four eggs, the last to be laid
was clear and the others were placed under a different broody hen.
The first egg began to chip on day 29 and hatched on day 31. There
was a gap of eight to nine hours between hatching in the first four
eggs but the last three emerged together. Although initially placed
in a brooder together, the last three to hatch had to be separated as
the others showed aggression towards them even at one day old.
The ducklings were very lively, pecking at each others feet and
showed no hesitation in taking live crickets and mealworms in

addition to chickcrumb, chopped lettuce and chopped sand-eel.
No measurements were taken to avoid stress. As the species was
known to be susceptible to aspergillosis and Candida the young-
sters were treated with Ketoconazole. At an age of 22 days, one
12.5mg tablet was given to each bird every day for ten days and the
dose was then increased to 25mg for a further ten days. Seven
young steamers were successfully reared and weaned onto a diet of
SDS Diet A, sprats and sand-eels and in the evening were seen to
catch midges, moths and even the occasional House Sparrow
Passer domesticus which came down to bathe. The youngsters were
eventually moved to WWT Centres at Slimbridge (5) and Washing-
ton (1 pair).
After removal of their eggs the adult Steamer Ducks were given
Aylesbury duck eggs to rear and subsequently hatched and reared
four ducklings, making excellent parents. However the drake 4 C'
was suspected as having aspergillosis and was treated with
Ketoconazole for twelve days after which the symptoms subsided.

During 1988 the drake 4 C' of the breeding pair appeared to be
losing condition and as a result the two clutches of eggs produced
by his mate, one of nine eggs and the second of seven, were both
clear. In June of that year he was treated again with Ketoconazole
for suspected aspergillosis and despite slight improvement his
condition deteriorated later in the year and he was euthanised at the
age of 15 years. Post mortem revealed that in addition to suffering
from tapeworm and arthritis which probably would not have caused
mortality, his oesophagus was blocked with grain.
The female 4 D' was moved to a pen next to the non-breeding pair
to prevent her from pining and to overcome territorial problems
when a new drake was introduced i.e. if she was left in the breeding
pen and a new drake introduced she might attack him causing stress
or even preventing him from feeding.
In 1989 a new, three year old drake 4 E' arrived from Wuppertal
and settled in well with his new mate 4 D\ Prior to that the female
had laid another two clutches of clear eggs. However, the "non-
breeding" pair 4 A' and 4 B' laid six eggs of which two hatched. The
youngsters, a pair, were reared successfully though the female was
treated for vitamin E deficiency. Both later went to Slimbridge.
Sadly, the female 4 B' then died (in November aged eight years) and
post mortem showed necrotic dermatitis of the foot (bumblefoot),
a massive burden of tapeworms, (despite routine treatment with
Panacur), nephropathy and TB. A female 4 F' from Martin Mere's

first clutch then arrived from Washington to join the male 'A' who
then promptly died during December from aspergillosis, also at
eight years of age.
In 1990 both females 'D'and 'F' laid clutches of clear eggs and
in 1991 the pair 'E' and 'D' produced a clutch of 10 eggs all
infertile. The drake 'E' died of DVE at five years of age, leaving
two potential laying females. They were housed together in the
absence of mates and although they did not at first associate,
despite being mother and daughter, they eventually became insep-
arable.
In 1992 'D' laid nine eggs in a barrel. These were replaced with
chipping mallard eggs which she reared successfully. The other
female showed no aggression towards the young but neither did she
show any interest. In 1993 'D' again laid an infertile clutch of
seven eggs. These were replaced with Mallard eggs and both
females bonded with the clutch. In 1994 both females produced
clutches but the older female 'D' died of chronic peritonitis in
November aged 13 years. Sadly the remaining nine year old female
was lost in January 1995 due to fox predation.
No attempt was made to pair the two females after 1990 due to
the unavailability of reliably pure-bred drakes.

The Bali Starling Leucopsar rothschildi is the most beautiful
starling in the world. Evidently found on the northwestern penin-
sula in Indonesia, this wonderful bird, sought so desperately by
many, is in danger of becoming extinct in the wild. The last count
of these birds put them at 35 - 37 circa surviving in the wild. (Van
Balen 1993). The Bali Starlings&apos; precarious state of danger seems
to have come mainly from taking of birds from the wild, for keeping
as pets and for display at zoological collections around the world.
Even reintroduced birds are stolen from the Bali Barat National
Park.
The bird is not a closed forest species. It prefers woodland and
tree savanna, particularly when interspread with forested valleys.
(Hughes and Turner, 1975). The species seems to be insectivorous,
but also forages for fruits, particularly during the dry season, when
insects are scarce. Bali Starlings are known to raise their young
purely on insectivorous food (Hughes and Turner, 1975). They
breed in tree holes loosely lined with dry grass, twigs and an
occasional feather. Normally three blue green eggs are laid, of
which two are hatched and one young survives. They probably
produce only one brood per year due to the limited breeding season.
(Hughes and Turner, 1975).
Housing and nesting facilities
The breeding pairs of Bali Starlings at Jurong BirdPark occupy
aviaries located at the Park&apos;s off-exhibit Breeding Centre. All the
breeding aviaries are of similar dimensions. They each measure
2.35m x 2.35m x 2.25m high. There are two compartments to each
of our breeding aviaries to provide maximum space. One compart-
ment serves as the feeding area while the other compartment is
utilized for the nestbox. All the aviaries have concrete flooring.
Potted plants are placed in the aviary for greenery and as cover for
the birds. The compartment with the feed bowls is only opened to
feed the birds. We also place a basin of water for the birds to bathe.
It must be mentioned that the Bali Starlings love taking baths daily
even when incubating eggs or raising chicks. Bali Starling fledg-
lings have been seen taking baths very early upon leaving their nest.

Nest boxes measuring 10&quot; x 10&quot; x 15&quot; high with an entrance hole
of 5&quot; is installed at a height of 2m. Each nestbox has an inspection
door at the side to monitor the eggs and the chicks and to change
nesting materials when required. (Fig 1) Nesting materials provid-
ed for the birds consist of leaves and twigs from Acacia Acacia
auriculiformis , dry grass and shredded papers as added substrate
especially so when there are chicks in the nest. It has been observed
that pairs tend to move their chiqks to corners of the nestbox where
there is insufficient nesting material. Chicks have been found on
the nestbox floor without proper support for their legs. This has
resulted in some having splayed or spraddled legs.
When pairs are raising young it is important to inspect the nest
at least once daily to monitor the development of the chick. We
inspect our chicks twice a day, once in the morning and in the
evening. Our breeding pairs have become accustomed to this
checking of the nest boxes and are not disturbed.
Diet
At Jurong BirdPark, the birds are given a diet consisting of live
food and a low iron softbill pellet. They are fed twice a day.
Our morning diet consists of butter cake, boiled egg, a local
softbill pellet, ant eggs and mealworms. The cake and egg are
grated and kept in a refrigerator. Ant eggs, mealworms and the
pellets are mixed to the prepared food every morning just before
each feeding. Each pair is fed about 120 grams of food in the
morning.
At midday the food is changed. Our afternoon diet consists of
the softbill pellets, pieces of papaya, banana and apple. We do not
give live food in the afternoon to our birds. Crickets,
grasshoppers and earthworms are alternated with mealworms in the
morning diet as a source of live food.
For pairs with young, we have a different feeding procedure.
From day 0 to 3 we give the breeding pair every hour from 8.00 am
to 6.00 pm 7 to 8 white mealworms. We give only white mealworms
and pupae because of the high level of keratin in brown mealworms.
Earlier chicks have died of stomach impaction as necropsy done on
our young chicks show stomach impaction with undigested cuticles
of brown mealworms.
If a pair has 2 or 3 chicks, we give as much as 10 white
mealworms. From day 4 to 10 we start giving other forms of live
food like earthworms, grasshoppers; small crickets and occasion-
ally day old mice. At this age we feed them at intervals of 1 /I IV 2
to 2 hours. Live food before being given to the birds is sprinkled

birds would beat the live food on the ground, thus mashing it up
before
Pair selection
Bali Starlings are sexually dimorphic in that the backward
directed crest is longer in the male, and in mature adult males
several long plumes trailing over the shoulders are seen quite
clearly. (Hughes and Turner, 1975). But at the Park, we confirm
the sexes through endoscopy as we have found the sexual dimor-
phism to be variable.
Females at our Park have laid eggs at 14 months. But males are
known only to reach maturity at 2 years of age. A strong pair bond
is an important factor for successful breeding. At the Park, we let
the birds form their own pairs.
All our unpaired female birds are placed in a holding aviary.
The holding aviary has an adjoining compartment where we place
a male bird. The male bird will be able to see all the females placed
in the holding aviary. All our birds are colour ringed. After
placing the male bird we observe for a week or more which female
spends most time interacting with the male. We make our obser-
vations based on display between the male and female, bobbing,
allopreening and vocalisations. Once a pair is confirmed, they are
removed to a breeding aviary.
Feather plucking
Feather plucking was found to occur mostly in a crowded cage
containing unpaired birds. Feathers of the throat-neck and crest
were affected. This behaviour is related to allopreening.
Breeding performance
Table 1 shows that for the five years analysed, 40% of the total
eggs laid either go missing or end up broken. Bali Starlings are
suspected of breaking infertile eggs.
Infertility seems to be a problem. From the data gathered for
the five years, we see that 33% of the total eggs laid are infertile.
If the missing and broken eggs are accounted as infertile then the
percentage of infertility will be 73%.
Infertility of eggs can be because of parental age, inbreeding,
non-synchronous breeding conditions and lack of pair bond. The
Bali Starlings at JBP have been acquired locally or were given to
the Park by authorities who confiscated them and as such, impor-
tant data like the age of the bird, its sire, its dam, its past history
are absent. These data are very important for planning the breeding
of the starlings.

Table 1 also shows that only 38% of the fertile eggs hatch. 16%
of total eggs laid are either embryonic death or dead-in-shell.
Reasons for embryonic death and dead-in-shell could be from
incompatibility of breeding pairs, viral infection - parent to egg,
parent nutrient deficiency and the age of the parent birds and
abnormal sperms.
We can also see that breeding pairs are able to raise young quite
successfully, 62% of the hatchlings survive. It seems that the
problem in general is one of low fertility rather than one of raising
young successfully.

Table 2 gives the breeding performance of the birds during the
different months of the year. As can be seen, the pairs breed
throughout the year at Jurong BirdPark. It is during the third
quarter (October to December) of the year that most eggs are
produced.
This is not surprising as it is also the time of the year when rain
is abundant As the breeding season in the wild coincides with the
rainy season the abundant availability of insects late in the wet
season, when young are hatched plays a role.
Incubation of eggs and care of young
Bali Starling eggs hatch after about 14 days incubation. Most
pairs start incubating after the clutch of three eggs are laid. Both
the male and female have been observed incubating but the female
incubates most of the time.
It has been observed that Bali Starlings like other species of
mynas e.g. Common Myna Acridotheres tristis constantly keep
adding and removing nest materials during the breeding cycle. The
chick when hatched is fed by both parents. The female usually plays
a major role for the first few days but when there is more than one
chick, or if a chick is more than six days old, both parents have been
observed feeding their offspring.
At the Jurong BirdPark we always want the parent starlings to
raise their young. But in some cases we had to pull chicks out
mainly because parents stop feeding or the chicks suffer some
injury.
In such cases the chicks are handraised at the Park's nursery.
The table below is a summary of one such chick that was raised.
Most chicks bred at the Jurong BirdPark fledged at about 18 days
varying between 17 to 20 days in some cases. The most important
thing to note during hand-rearing of such a rare species is the effect
of imprinting. We always try to minimise it as much as possible by
having as little contact with humans as possible and by introducing
new fledglings to their own kind a soon as possible.
Conclusion
Zoos are fortunate in having an endangered species like the Bali
Starling in sufficient numbers in captivity to sustain a good breed-
ing programme. As such, we need to determine the causes of
observed variations in breeding performance to ensure further
successes.
Nevertheless, the success of the captive breeding of the Bali
Starling has improved since the programme's inception. Exchange
of information between zoos breeding Bali Starling is required to

Muscicapidae is the family of Old World flycatchers comprising
a dozen or so genera, one of which is Niltava. Exactly how many
Niltavas make up the genus depends on which literature is consult-
ed, although the long-established and traditional view is that it
contains six members:Greater Niltava grandis , Lesser N.
macgregoriae , Fukien N. davidi , Rufous-bellied N. sunaara ,
Sumatran N. sumatrana and Vivid N. vivida. Some authorities,
however, have greatly enlarged the Niltava genus: one of the genera
that makes up Muscicapidae is Cyornis, but in the checklist given
by Howard and Moore this genus is eliminated and all of its
members converted to Niltavas. Similar treatment is also given to
several Ficedula and Muscicapa species, swelling the Niltava
genus to a grand total of 24 and transforming such familiar names
as the Tickell's Flycatcher into Tickell's Niltava. Flycatcher
taxonomy has always been in a state of flux. Presently I can find
4 different scientific names for the Indian Verditer Flycatcher but
generally such work is academic since for the aviculturist the
members of this wonderful family share broadly the same require-
ments. In appearance the Greater Niltava is more like a thrush than
a flycatcher being a fairly large, roundish bird measuring about
21cm. There is no mistaking the sexes. Although in poor light the
male appears as almost black; when properly illuminated he is
dazzling. Only his face, throat and breast are actually black with
a sparkling cobalt blue covering the crown, nape, lesser wing
coverts upper tail coverts and forming a bar on either side of the
neck which, in a paler blue, is shared by the female. His wings and
tail are a dirty purplish-blue, the back a slightly cleaner shade and
the underparts greyish blue. The female is an all-over pleasant
brown highlighted by the shiny, light blue bar on either side of her
neck. Her wings and tail are reddish brown, the vent area grey and
throat very pale brown.
Niltava grandis is certainly rare in aviculture although in the
wild all four recognised sub-species are said to be at least common
in their respective ranges: N.g.grandis (E.Himalayas to N. Vietnam),
N. g. decipiens (Sumatra, S.Thailand, Malaysia), N.g.griseiventris
(S.E. Yunnan) and N.g. decorata (S.E. Vietnam). It is a fairly robust
bird and a resident of the humid evergreen forests at elevations

between 1,000m and 2,500m,descending to the warmer foothills in
regions where winter forces it. Various habitats are occupied from
the deepest parts of the forest to clearings and along trails. It will
swoop to the floor for an insect or catch slow flying insects on the
wing. Even in the aviary its manoeuvreability is such that a moth
can be caught after only a short aerial chase.
Accommodation
Towards the end of 1992 the zoo purchased a pair of Greater
Niltavas, housing them off-exhibit in an aviary measuring 3m x lm
x 2m high. Of the 10 or so Niltava pairs I have kept (Lesser,Rufous-
bellied and Greater) none of them have needed to be parted due to
fighting,although certainly many insectivores are prone to such
aggression, and to house the male and female alongside each other
for an introductory period is prudent. Having completed the zoo's
standard 30 day quarantine, the Niltavas had, in fact, been so
housed and were used to the sight of each other. Without apprehen-
sion they were therefore released into their aviary, of which they
were the sole occupants.
The aviary is furnished with perches of varying diameters, a lm
high Rubber Plant and five hanging baskets of bushy, fast growing
species; the baskets hang from the aviary's roof while the plant is
on the floor, towards the front of the aviary. The birds are not
especially nervous, but such foliage can only encourage breeding
and generally speaking the more the better. And to increase the
feeling of seclusion, coconut matting lines the aviary's walls,
which also visually separate the Niltavas from their neighbours.
The aviary floor is covered with coarse sand, a few log pieces and
some small potted plants.
It is one of a number that are collectively maintained at about
24*C with about 60% humidity provided by a mister system. This
is programmed to operate for five minutes every afternoon, being
beneficial for the plants as well as encouraging reluctant bathers to
clean their plumage.
Diet
In the wild Greater Niltavas are said to eat berries during the
winter to supplement an otherwise insectivorous diet. Given the
choice, however, berries and fruits in general are not at all popular
and in captivity a good quality, fine-grade insectile mixture will
completely meet a Niltava's nutritional requirements. Some 10%
of the insectile mix should contain livefood such as mealworms, wax
moth larvae and medium sized crickets. And if not already
moist,the mixture should be softened with milk, pureed apple or

tofu. As for all insectivores, I add finely chopped or mashed hard
boiled egg since it is an often popular food,coming a close second
to the insects themselves. It presumably resembles ant pupae or a
similar food eaten in the wild (see also Vince 1994).
Breeding
Niltavas build a cup shaped nest either in vegetation or con-
cealed in cavities, such as may be found in rockwork or rotten tree
stumps. The Niltavas were therefore offered a half open-fronted
nest box measuring 15cm x 15cm x 23cm high. It was empty and
fixed high up at the back of the aviary so as to almost touch the roof.
In the middle of February both birds became more vocal than usual.
Even at its loudest the Greater Niltava is a quiet bird but now the
soft, ascending three or four note whistle could be heard often,
sometimes repeatedly for 30 seconds or more. The pair was rather
shy, but luckily I did see the female try to attract the male to her:
with her body lowered about 2cm she stood on a high perch and
fluttered her wings, but he was not enticed and her amour appeared
to die there. Three weeks later, however, on March 6th,nest
building began and lasted for eight days. The nest was constructed
in the box provided and was a full 7cm deep when complete. It
comprised pieces of fine string, leaf fragments, fine grasses and
Sphagnum moss. By far the major ingredient though was bison
wool collected from the zoo's North American exhibit; lambs' wool
was also offered but little was accepted. As far as I could tell the
female alone built the nest and, very interestingly, did appear to
discriminate between the wools. She selected almost exclusively
those of a dark shade, ignoring the paler colours, especially white,
irrespective of whether they were lamb or bison in origin. Much of
the lambs' wool was in fact white and I am sure that explains its lack
of appeal, since as a nesting material most other birds find it to their
liking. Although I have had little experience of birds selecting
materials according to their shade, the pale fibres may have been
rejected because they were considered too conspicuous. The nest
was completed on March 14th and the first of three eggs was laid
on the 15th. Incubation was carried out solely by the female and
began with the laying of the first egg. The eggs were an ivory
colour but very heavily marked with rust coloured speckles of
varying sizes. Three weeks passed and nothing had come of the
clutch; the eggs were found to be clear and were duly removed.
Twelve days later three more eggs were laid but they too were clear.
Fourteen days after their removal another clutch of three was laid.
This time all were fertile and three chicks hatched, one day apart,

following 14 days of incubation.
Plenty of wax moth larvae, mealworms and medium sized
crickets were offered as a rearing food to supplement the standard
insectile diet as well as maggots and hatching blowflies. The latter
had proved very successful in the rearing of Verditer Flycatchers
although were completely ignored by the Niltavas. Care was taken
to dust the livefood with a vitamin and mineral powder since the
most risk of rickets in insectivores' chicks is higher than with most
other softbills: omnivores feed their chicks purely livefood only for
the first week or so, thereafter feeding the more varied adult diet.
But insectivores such as Niltavas receive purely livefood for about
the first month, until they are old enough to feed themselves and
therefore follow their parents'example in eating the insectile mix-
ture. Experience has shown that 1 week is not long enough to give
rise to rickets although 1 month almost certainly is.
Hand Rearing
I only ever observed the female taking food to the nest with the
male standing guard; I do not think he was specifically guarding her
but his nervousness at one's approach alerted her, nevertheless.
As with many birds the wax moth larvae was the favoured rearing
food but for reasons I have never been able to fathom, the female
also fed tiny pebbles to her young, a fact not apparent until two
chicks were thrown dead from the nest nine days after hatching.
Though looking very much alive and with prospects, the third chick
seemed doomed in the care of its mother. It was therefore removed
for hand rearing at 10 days of age. The chick weighed 27.3g and
was initially brooded at 90*F although this was reduced to 80*F two
hours later, in response to the bird's mild panting. The chick was
taken from the nest on June 14th at 9am. At 10.30 six tiny pebbles,
2mm in diameter, were found beside the bird and since they were
not in the faeces were presumably coughed up. From there onwards
it was plain sailing, especially since the chick was fully feathered,
reasonably large and, had it remained with its parents, only three
or four days from fledging. Chopped pinks, wax moth larvae and
mealworms were the rearing foods being dipped in pureed green
beans (as sold for newborn babies) before feeding. Included also
was a sprinkling of a vitamin and mineral supplement to guarantee
the diet's qual-ity. On June 14th a total of six chopped pinks plus
eight moth larvae and mealworms were eaten, spread more or less
evenly over eight feeds from 9.00am to 9.00pm. The following day
the Niltava was perching on the side of its margarine tub. Its
appetite had dropped slightly but on the 16th, rose to consume 10

pinks plus five larvae and worms. On the 17th, flying skills were
discovered as the chick almost flew out of the brooder. And on the
21st it started to feed itself, eating a couple of slices of pink. From
the 21st to the 30th, the chick was fed four times a day. By hand
(using tweezers) it was now only being fed five to six pinks a day
with the remainder of its diet taken by itself from a food dish. The
dish contained the standard insectile diet but with chopped pinks on
the surface. Although the pinks would not feature in the adult diet,
they were still of value; in eating them the bird would be introduced
to the insectile mix as it stuck to their wet surfaces. Hand feeding
was gradually reduced until on July 13th it was stopped completely.
The bird was now 5!4 weeks old and placed in its own indoor aviary
that was maintained at about 70*F. By now the chopped pinks had
been removed from the diet and the young Niltava was thriving on
the standard adult insectile mixture.

With the advent of Ostrich farming and resultant scarcity in zoos
of female Ostriches our male Masai Ostrich Struthio camelus
masaicus remained unpaired in 1994. We have now been promised
a 1994 bred female on breeding loan but it will be several years
before we may expect egg-laying. The Emus Dromaius
novaehollandiae hatched a single chick in March and began laying
again in December. Rheas Rhea americana were also successful in
rearing chicks this year.
Whereas only two Humboldt Penguin Spheniscus humboldti
chicks hatched in 1993 (neither of which survived) 10 were hatched
between March and July. Again we experienced problems with
these chicks but by the year-end three fine youngsters had been
reared. Five more chicks hatched in December and we hope this
may be a turning point, returning us to those heady years of 1986-
1988 when 46 chicks were reared over a three year period. With
managed breeding programmes, any one zoo producing such high
numbers is now less important and indeed may be contrary to the
aims of the programme. Over the whole of Europe the co-ordinated
Humboldt Penguin population continues to increase even though
individual colonies have their ups and downs. Six unrelated young
Humboldts were received on loan at Chester from Penscynor and a
further six purchased from Birdworld.
Other new arrivals include two White Pelicans Pelecanus
onocratulus bred at Tierpark Berlin. It is over 15 years since
Chester Zoo last held pelicans so these new additions have caused
some excitement here. Also new to the collection are four Scarlet
Ibis Eudocimus ruber received from Zurich Zoo. Six Waldrapp Ibis
Geronticus eremita were successfully parent-reared by two pairs in
the original colony. Those Waldrapps transferred to the 'Europe on
the Edge' exhibit showed little interest in breeding in 1994. At the
year end a group of 1993 bred birds were transferred to the new
exhibit and with this increase in numbers it is hoped the resident
Waldrapps may be stimulated to breed this year.
Six Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis were reared in
1994. The increase in the numbers of Chilean Flamingos reared this
year resulted from intensive egg management. Each egg was
removed and replaced by a wooden dummy. If fertile the egg was

returned a few days prior to pipping and left to hatch under the
parents. This allowed a greater number of eggs to hatch and more
chicks to be reared. Observations indicated that there was much
aggression between flamingos in the closely adjacent nests with
eggs being deliberately knocked off nests. Indeed the only way to
ensure the birds remained sitting on nests once their own egg had
been removed was to use a spiked dummy egg that could be firmly
secured into the nest. Unsecured dummys were knocked off and the
nests taken over by other pairs. The first egg returned to a Chilean
nest had just externally pipped. This proved to be a mistake for it
was immediately knocked off the nest by a non-parental female. On
being returned to the nest again that same female rushed to the nest
before the parents could return and deliberately smashed the egg
with her bill. She had been looking for a preferred central nest site
herself as indicated by her laying an egg the next morning. Subse-
quently eggs were returned before external pipping and all six
hatched and were reared.
Egg management was practiced only for the Chilean Flamingos
where a problem had been indicated after only a single youngster
was reared in 1993. The Caribbean Flamingos P. ruber ruber also
reared six chicks but without our intervention.
Four Black-necked Swans, Cygnus melanocoryphus, five Red-
breasted Geese Branta ruficollis and four Hawaiian Geese B.
sandvicensis were reared - the latter by their parents. Other
waterfowl reared include Mandarin Ducks Aix galericulata, Caro-
lina Wood Ducks A. sponsa, Laysan Teal Anas laysanensis, Mar-
bled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, White-winged Wood Ducks
Cairina scutulata, Rosy-billed Pochard Netta rufina, Hooded Mer-
gansers Mergus cucullatus and Smew M. albellus. Three Smew
were hatched and reared under their mother, the ducklings being
transferred with their mother to a shed once hatched. Cuban
Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna arborea, recently received on loan
from the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, laid during the year but none
were hatched. White-headed Ducks Oxyura leucocephala and
Baikal Teal Anas formosa were hatched but neither were reared to
independence.
Five Bare-faced Curassows Crax fasciolata were reared as were

bred by Glen Howe in Canada and quarantined on our behalf by
Banham Zoo. Other galliforms bred in 1994 were 15 Edwards'
Pheasants Lophura edwardsi 15 Himalayan Monals Lophura
impeyanus, Golden Pheasants Chrysolophus pictus, Palawan Pea-
cock-Pheasant Polyplectron emphanum, Common Peafowl Pavo
cristatus and Californian Quail Lophortyx californica.
Our Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis reared two young-
sters. This was the first time they had hatched two chicks and the
siblings at first fought viciously causing us much anxiety. However
after several weeks this aggression faded and both chicks were
reared together. For the first time we attempted artificial insemi-
nation on our Wattled Cranes Bugeranus caruncu/atus and
Demoiselle Cranes Anthropoides virgo. Debbie Bourne was kind
enough to demonstrate this for our Wattled Cranes and the proce-
dure was repeated by our staff on the Demoiselles. Sadly the
exercise was unsuccessful in that the Wattled Crane eggs proved
infertile and the Demoiselles failed to recycle. Blue Cranes A.
paradisea are new to the collection having been received on loan
from Harewood Bird Gardens and from Whipsnade Zoo.
Gough Island Moorhens Gallinula comeri , after a number of
years with unsuccessful breeding attempts, succeeded in rearing a
chick from their first brood this year but were unsuccessful in
rearing two chicks hatched from a later brood. Our two male Sun
Bitterns Eurypyga helias have been without a mate for over ten
years. As such we were extremely pleased to receive a female on
loan from Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water. She also is quite an
elderly bird so it will be interesting to see whether we can achieve
a pairing.
A group of Avocets Recurvirostra avosetta now grace the
'Europe on the Edge' aviary along with Stone Curlews Burhinus
oedicnemus. Also new to this enclosure are four wild type Rock
Doves Columba livia donated by Zurich Zoo. Within Great Britain
there are now few pure colonies of Rock Doves, most having been
infiltrated either by feral pigeons or stray racing pigeons.
Nicobar Pigeons were received only recently into the collection
and are housed as a group in the first block of new spacious aviaries
in the Tropical House: one pair nested and successfully reared a
chick. A pair of Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi ,
sharing the same enclosure had five successive breeding attempts
from which a total of 16 chicks were hatched. Eight of these were
reared by a combination of parent and hand-rearing. Three other
pairs of Rothschild&apos;s Mynahs held elsewhere in the collection

failed to hatch a single chick between them. Both pairs of Superb
Fruit Doves Ptilinopus superba reared chicks but the three reared
to maturity all moulted out as males. Blue Crowned Pigeons Goura
cristata after being moved down into one of the new Tropical House
aviaries laid for the first time since they were received in the
collection. Pink Pigeons Nesoenas mayeri released into the free-
flight of the Tropical House failed to nest but have become aggres-
sive towards other pigeons in the same area although not to other
birds. If the Pink Pigeons would breed in that area then as an
endangered species such disturbance would be acceptable. Should
no breeding attempts ensue then we may have to re-think this option
and house them elsewhere.

time at Chester, one chick being hand-reared from an incubator
hatched egg.
The Wrinkled Hornbills Aceros corrugatus made no breeding
attempt when in the Bird House during the summer and were moved
in the autumn to their new quarters in the Tropical House. Our
original pair of Channel-billed Toucans Ramphastos vitellinus,
despite the female now looking her age, again fledged two chicks.
These youngsters looked excellent strong birds so I was the more
surprised on returning from a zoo visit to California to discover that
both youngsters and the breeding male had died during my absence.
That sadly may have signalled the end to eight years successful
breeding of Channel-billed Toucans. Our second pair also suc-
cumbed during the final month of the year. Post mortems have
suggested differing causes for each death but I cannot help but feel
there must have been some unidentified common condition that led
to these five deaths in such a short space of time.
Success is not easily won with birds and where no co-ordinated
breeding programmes exist we are now forced to question the long-
term value of aviculture. Fortunately, many such programmes exist
for many parrots allowing the possbility of recovery from the
intermittent setbacks in individual collections.

Our parrot breeding results exceeded our expectations this year
but we were brought back to earth at the end of the year with the
deaths of several important birds. Both pairs of Blue and Gold
Macaws Ara ararauna fledged two youngsters. However one of
these pairs have developed a habit of plucking their chicks in the
nest. Surprisingly this is the pair held in the largest enclosure
whilst the pair maintained in the smaller parrot house aviary have
never displayed this vice. The Red-fronted Macaws A rubrogenys
hatched and reared five chicks in one brood. Five Blue-eyed
Cockatoos Cacatua ophthalmica were hand-reared from incubator
hatched eggs. Again the main breeding pair of Blue-eyed Cocka-
toos were allowed to sit a clutch of their own eggs but this was
without success. Green-cheeked Amazons Amazona viridigenalis
hatched and reared four chicks and the Lilacine Amazons A.
autumnalis lilacina reared two chicks. Again this was soured by the
loss of the breeding female later in the year. Our Cuban Amazons
A. leucocephala were obtained as confiscated birds from Customs
and Excise. These form part of a breeding programme in U.K zoos
managed from Chester. We were extremely pleased when the
Cubans nested but perhaps due to her partner's inattentiveness, the
female abandoned her three chicks after two weeks necessitating
them to be taken for hand-rearing. All three were successfully
reared completing our hat-trick of Amazon breeding in 1994.
Yellow-backed Chattering Lories Lorius garrullus flavopalliatus
and Stella's Lorikeets Charmosynapapou goliathina were success-
fully reared. Only one Musschenbroek's Lorikeet Neopsittacus
musschenbroeki fledged but unfortunately did not survive to the
year end.
Other parrots bred included two Derbyan Parrakeets Psittacula
derbyana, four Splendid Parrakeets Neophema splendida, four
Slender-billed Conures Enicognathus leptorhynchus, four Greater
Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa and two Lesser Vasa Parrots C.
nigra.
This year's greatest success was in the hatching of two Thick-
billed Parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha both of which were
parent-reared. Golden Conures Guaruba guarouba after laying for
the first time in 1993 went one stage further by hatching but failing
to rear a chick in 1994.
New arrivals included Black-winged Lories Eos cynaogenia and
Blue-streaked Lories E. reticulata on loan from Penscynor and
amongst other birds a pair of exquisite Red-flanked Lorikeets
Charmosyna pulchella generously donated by Frank Woolham.

The Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca were unsuccessful in rearing
their chicks but three White-faced Scops Owls Otus leucotis and
four Barn Owls Tyto alba were reared. We work in close conjunc-
tion with the Keele University Barn Owl Release Scheme run by Dr
Carole Hackney and as in previous years the young Barn Owls were
donated to the release scheme. A total of 111 Barn Owls bred at
Chester Zoo have now been released through this and other ap-
proved schemes in Cheshire, the Wirral and more recently Stafford-
shire. With the increasing pressures on wild bird populations zoos
like Chester are looking at how they can become further involved
in zoo breeding programmes that are linked to conservation in the
wild.

A recent publication from the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust,
Wetland, Industry and Wildlife by Antony Merritt is a valuable
book, not only for the growing number of wildlife officers and
ecologists now working in UK industry, but for anyone with land
which includes an area of one of the world&apos;s most threatened
habitats.
It is above all a practical guide to the creation, restoration and
maintenance of wetlands so that they are of real value to wildlife.
The book has 182 pages and although colour photographs are used
only on the front and back covers, it is generously illustrated
throughout with photographs and plans.
The manual is set out in three parts which describe and discuss
a range of topics related to wetlands, industry and wildlife. Part I
considers the role and involvement of industry in the creation and
management of wetlands. Part II provides an overview of wetland
ecology, design, creation and management, drawn from recent
literature and experience. Part III looks at the most significant
types of industrial wetlands found in the UK, featuring selected
case studies where appropriate, and considers their current and
potential value to wildlife.
There are also 11 useful appendices dealing with associated
subjects including trees and shrubs; aquatic plants; birds of fresh-
water and esturarine habitat; etc.

Without actually seeing and handling it, and leafing through its
638 (310 x 240 mm) pages, it would have been impossible to believe
that Volume 2 of the HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD
could be better than its predecessor. For how do you improve on
perfection? Only, one assumes, with the help of Divine Interven-
tion. So, practically every other superlative that might be lavished
on a work of this kind having been fully utilised, let me be the first
to congratulate editors, Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott and Jordi
Sargatal on the quality of their connections!

There is much in this particular volume to interest aviculturists
for it encompasses all presently known species (and significant
subspecies) of diurnal Raptors and most of the Galliformes. So far
as the latter are concerned, if you want to know more about the
Hoatzin you will have to wait for Volume 3 (covering Hoatzin to
Auks) which is scheduled for publication in mid-1996.
The second volume, as one would anticipate, closely follows the
style of Volume 1 - descriptions of each family and species&apos;
accounts. The former are extremely comprehensive while the latter
tend to be informative but concise. No matter where you look in
these superlative early volumes you are unlikely to find yourself,
as is the case with most other works other than monographs, short
of information.
The two bird-keepers among our four sons now look forward
eagerly to the appearance of a new volume of the HBW. For they
know they will be the recipients of&apos;fallout&apos; from my modest library
of previously published works, some of them of recent origin,
which are now being rendered almost obsolete by &apos;the&apos; Handbook.
Illustrative content is brilliant - the publishers say they are 4 ...
probably the most original element of the work'. I would disagree
- only to suggest they are &apos;one&apos; of the most original elements.
Plates, by world famous artists, will depict for the first time all
of the world&apos;s known bird species. Several figures have been
painted for some species, illustrating sexual dimimorphism, plus
all relatively common morphs in polymorphic species, together
with distinctive subspecies.
Photographs are again outstanding. For me one of the most
pleasant surprises was to see, on page 435, a photograph of the
Udzungwa Forest-partridge Xenoperdix udzungwensis. Discov-
ered only in 1991, it was first believed to be a Francolin until, when
scientifically described in early 1994, it was placed in a monotypic
genus and is believed to be most closely related to Asia's Arborophila
Hill-Partridges.
Now, knowing a little - just a little - about the publishing world,
I can assure members that with a massive book of this kind,
published in late 1994 and able to refer to material revealed only

a few months earlier - well, you really can't be more up-to-date than
that.
There are many other photographs to add to the beautiful and
valuable illustrative quality of the plates. I set out to draw
attention to those that took my eye, but realised that, with at least
80%, for one reason or another, utterly eye-catching, space would
not allow such an indulgence.
Volume 2 of the HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD
costs a cool #98.00 (plus #5.00 postage and packing).
Now why should you spend so much money on a bird book? I
can tell you quickly and easily. Because until someone else with
undreamed of connections comes along with a better idea, this
looks likely to remain the definitive work for many years to come.
And I suspect that cared-for volumes will appreciate rapidly in
value.

FREDDIE COOKE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973068894736842" page_id="56270550"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
Frederick Charles Cooke, known to his many friends as 'Fred'
or 'Freddie 5 , died earlier this year following a long illness. He is
survived by two sons from his first marriage, by his widow, Dulcie,
her son and his children.
Freddie brought commitment, skill and enthusiasm to every-
thing he did. At Worcester School he played rugby, ran for the
school and sang in the choir of Worcester Cathedral.
Prior to the outbreak of World War II he was already a pilot in
the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. During the war he was in
charge of a substantial number of engineers who serviced aircraft
on Bomber Command's operational squadrons and was thus, to
some degree, responsible for the lives of aircrew.
After the war he worked for many years for a major aircraft
company, becoming a Director and travelling widely, mainly to
America, Africa and Germany. He retired twice, but each time
missed the pace of the business life to which he had become
accustomed.
Following the death of his first wife, and with his sons already
married, his marriage to Dulcie brought him into contact with a
whole new world - aviculture. With customary enthusiasm, he
equipped himself properly, immersing himself in activities ranging
from the study of genetics to designing and constructing superb
aviaries. He also lectured and chaired seminars, and with Dulcie
wrote many articles and books on subjects connected with avicul-
ture.
Dulcie, his two sons, their relatives and large circle of friends
knew well the intense warmth of his personality, and in Dulcie's
case the great love they shared during 21 years of marriage.
Freddie was also a quite splendid Grandfather, affectionately
enthusiastic with even the youngest Grandchild. For the older ones
- and at the age of 73 - he was the author of a simple manual dealing
with computer skills.
His ability to make the best possible use of time was an
inspiration to all who knew him, as was his great courage during a
long illness.
He numbered many members of the Avicultural Society among
his friends and will be greatly missed by all of them.

MACAWS FLOCK TO SOTHEBY'S
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995347827586207" page_id="56270551"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
Sotheby's are holding an exhibition, from Monday 17th to
Friday 28th July (Monday to Friday, 9.00 am to 4.30 pm), to
celebrate completion of what is described as '... one of the most
ambitious publishing projects of the century'. Macaws are the
subject of an exceptional limited edition of hand-coloured etchings
by acclaimed artist, Elizabeth Butterworth. The edition of 50,
entitled 'Macaws', consists of 12 life-size etchings. The project,
which has taken 12 years, is the brainchild of specialist publisher
and ornithologist, Rodolphe d&apos;Erlanger.
The exhibition will include the artist's original sketches and
watercolours alongside the etchings, and will be held at 34/35, New
Bond Street, London, Wl. Profits from the project will be donated
to the Friends of the Peruvian Rainforest, who aim to secure one
million acres of Peruvian rainforest in order to maintain the habitat
of macaws and other wildlife in perpetuity.
'Macaws' was printed on handrolling etching presses - replicas
of those used in the 18th and 19th centuries - but the sheer size of
each image presented d'Erlanger's printers with a considerable
challenge. No-one has ever attempted to overprint up to six plates
with hair-line registration. For the 12 illustrations, 61 imperial
copper plates were made, more than 350 specially mixed colours
were used and, in one instance, 17 colours were inked onto a single
plate.
Born in Lancashire and trained at the Rochdale School of Art,
Elizabeth Butterworth completed her studies at the Royal College
of Art, London. Since the mid-1970s she has had one-woman
exhibitions in major world centres as well as taking part in group
shows in the UK, USA and Japan. Her works are in many public
collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the

publications include Parrots and Cockatoos (1978, Fischer Fine
Art, London) and Parrots, Macaws, Cockatoos: the art of Elizabeth
Butterworth (1989, Abrams, New York).
Rodolphe d'Erlanger, a passionate ornithologist, commissioned
Elizabeth Butterworth to paint a portrait of one of his parrots in
1977, and so began a creative partnership resulting in the award-
winning monograph Amazon Parrots which was published by

BREEDINGS AT BIRDPARK AVIFAUNA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976873375" page_id="56270553"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
Several species have already bred in 1995 at Birdpark Avifauna.
As usual the first hatchings were in the Tropical Hall where Masked
Plovers Vanelius miles hatched three chicks, with Blacksmith
Plover V. atratus playing their part with three youngsters. All were
parent-reared and it is a lovely sight to see how the adults take care
of their offspring.
The same good care is also shown by pigeons, although they are
not so aggressive as the plovers. Chicks have been hatched by Red-
throated Ground Dove Gallicolumba rufigula, Black-chinned
Ptilinopus lechlancheri and Orange-fronted Fruit Doves P.
aurantifrons.
It was much more difficult to discover how many chicks the hen
Red-billed Hornbill Tockus erythrorhynchus had in her nestbox and
we had to wait to find out until four youngsters eventually fledged.
Another hornbill species, Von der Decken's T. deckeni, has just
mudded-in in an aviary outside the Tropical Hall. In 1994 this
species successfully raised four chicks for us.
We were not successful in rearing our 13th Great Indian Hornbill
Buceros bicornis. This year the two eggs were infertile. But we
have new hopes concerning our Southern Ground Hornbills Bucorvus
leadbeateri. Two eggs have been placed in an incubator and it
seems they are fertile. I hope I can report a good result with this
species later in the year.
Many birds laid early in their winter aviaries. These include
Scarlet Eucodimus ruber and Puna Ibis Plegadis ridgwayi. Some
of our birds do not experience any problems with low temperatures.
Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae , and some waterfowl including
Black Swan Cygnus atratus and Hawaiian Goose Branta
sandvicensis , together with Jackass Penguin Spheniscus demersus x
all laid eggs earlier this year.
On the subject of waterfowl, we discovered in the Tropical Hall
that African Pygmy Geese Nettapus auritus were on a clutch of
eight eggs. They raised seven youngsters last year so we are
hopeful they will repeat that success in 1995.
We have some new birds as a result of exchanges with other
zoos. We sent four Jackass Penguins to Hanover Zoo and received
in return a pair of Violet Touraco Mu soph aga violaceous i We also
received a cock Blue-winged Pitta Pitta moluccensis from Frank-
furt Zoo.

SPIX'S MACAW RELEASE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997831" page_id="56270554"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
A female Spix&apos;s Macaw Cyanopsitta spixii was released back
into the wild on 17th March 1995, marking the culmination of years
of planning and preparation. The bird in question was hatched and
reared in the wild but had spent many years in captivity in Brazil.
Some six months prior to the release it was installed in a large,
specially-designed cage to become used to the natural habitat
environment of the site and the new food source which would form
the basis of its diet once it was released. By mid-March members
of the team, who had been carefully monitoring the bird for several
months, decided the time was right for the release to take place.
The cage door was opened at 6.30 am and the macaw soon flew
from the cage, initially covering about 300 metres before resting
for a short period. It then flew a similar distance to land in a Pinhao
tree where it spent its first night roosting at liberty. The monitoring
team have reported that the bird has been seen to utilise other food
types in addition to the Pinhao, which it had been fed during the
adaptation period. It is not yet flying great distances but recordings
of the vocalisation of the wild male Spix&apos;s Macaw (at present some
distance away and still paired with an Illiger&apos;s Macaw A maracana)
are being played in an attempt to stimulate more momentum from
the female.

GLOBAL WARMING LINK WITH EARLY NESTING?

Recent analyses of nesting data for many British birds, gathered
by the British Trust for Ornithology, have shown a marked trend
towards earlier nesting. This has been linked to global warming
and has affected a number of species. Earlier this year, Humphrey
Crick, nest Records Officer for the BTO, urged farmers and garden-
ers to take care, even at the end of March, when trimming hedges.
Long-tailed Tits Aegithalos caudatus and Chaffinch Fringilla
coelebs were on average a week earlier than in 1961 and 1976
respectively, and Greenfinches Carduelis chloris are 10 days ear-

In the USA, a mysterious affliction which is affecting eastern
House Finch Carpodacus mexicanus populations has caught the
attention of wildlife biologists and others with an interest in wild
birds. The disease, an eye infection, has been confirmed in House
Finches in half a dozen eastern states, but in October 1994 no cases
had been reported in Canada. Infected birds have swollen, puffy
faces or runny or crusted eyes. The prime suspect is the microor-
ganism Mycoplasma gallicepticum , usually a disease affecting
poultry. It poses no risk to human beings.

The recently published results of a British Trust for

revealed that there are now 3,400 'churring' male Nightjars
Caprimulgus europaeus in the UK, an increase of 75% on the 1981
figure. The survey also shows that the Nightjar's range has
expanded since 1981, with 13 counties reoccupied. Key to the
change appears to be the creation of suitable habitat following the
amount of forestry plantation clearfelled and restocked since 1981,
providing the open conditions required by breeding Nightjars.

I hope Members will agree that it is good to see London Zoo
Notes reappearing in th q Avicultural Magazine after an absence of
several years. Senior Curator, Simon Tonge has promised to supply
notes on a regular basis and it will be interesting to read of the
changes that are being made in the Regent's Park collection in the
months and years ahead.
The magazine (or rather its Editor) is again suffering from a
disturbing lack of material for inclusion between its covers. Much
has been promised from around the world and, in fairness, much has
been delivered. But during 1995 several commitments have yet to
be honoured and I ask the people concerned to try to devote a little
time to writing original material about the interesting avicultural
experiences in which they have been involved.
At a recent Council Meeting, the Society's Chairman, Professor
J. R. Hodges asked that in future a brief summary of all such
meetings should be reported in the Avicultural Magazine - please

BREEDING THE RED-TAILED AMAZON AT THE
TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985333297297297" page_id="56270564"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
By Mike Curzon (Rode, Somerset).
The Red-tailed Amazon Amazona brasiliensis is listed in Ap-
pendix 1 of CITES. The species is found in south-eastern Brazil
and in his second (revised) edition of Parrots of the World
(Lansdowne Editions, Melbourne, 1978), Forshaw makes no refer-
ence to having seen the species in the wild. The illustration by
Cooper in the same work was painted in 1972. It shows a bird with
a darker back and with more yellow in the tail than the birds at
Rode. Could it be that coloration deepens with age? Certainly the
colour of our birds has intensified over the past VA years. So far
as I am aware, the only colour illustration of the Red-tailed Amazon
to have appeared in the Avicultural Magazine was in January/
February 1960 when a colour photograph was reproduced. The bird
in question was owned by F. H. Maxwell.
In those days the quality of colour photography and reproduc-
tion of prints and transparencies was not very good compared to the
standards being achieved today. Any members who are fortunate
enough to have Rosemary Low's Amazon Parrots will see the
species depicted in a plate by Elizabeth Butterworth which is much
more in line with the birds we have in the collection here.
HM Customs and Excise offered us four birds, which had
previously been confiscated, in September 1991. You can imagine
our surprise and delight at being given an opportunity to work with
this relatively unknown Amazon. The birds' ages were unknown
and all were extremely timid. Therefore, they were allowed time
to settle down.
The sexes are similar in appearance and the four birds paired up
as we had believed they would. However, to ensure that all was
well they were surgically sexed and microchipped in the autumn of
1993. One pair was believed to be mature, but in the case of the
second pair ('B') the cock was an immature.
The birds were housed in identical aviaries, in the same range,
in an off-display area, each being 15 ft. x 5 ft. x 7.5 ft. high. There
is a half open-fronted shelter at the rear and the birds receive early
morning sun. As previously stated, they were extremely nervous
when first received from the quarantine station and took longer to
settle down than any other species of Amazon we have had at Rode.

Their diet consists of a mixture of sunflower, safflower, buck-
wheat, mixed soaked pulses (soaked for 24 hours), peanuts, fruits
in season and root vegetables (mainly beetroot and carrots) al-
though only one pair will consume these latter items.
The following notes relate only to pair 'B\
Our standard Amazon nestbox measures 20 in x 10 in x 10 in.
The first box was put into position at the back of the aviary,
alongside the shelter but with the entrance hole facing the other
way to give maximum privacy. During 1993 the pair did nothing
other than play around with the box and roosted outside at night.
Neighbouring birds were a pair of Hahn's Macaws Diopsittaca
nobilis , in an aviary to the left while that on the right was empty.
Early in 1994 a second nestbox was placed inside the shelter,
immediately behind the door. Both boxes were used but it was the
second of them that was eventually selected by the pair. We had
placed pieces of rotten wood in the base and these were chewed by
the female.
Two eggs were seen on 20th May and the birds were left
undisturbed. On 17th June our Head Keeper, John Meeke looked
into the box and saw two chicks and one egg; one of the chicks was
recently hatched. The adults were not very vocal - which is unusual
compared to our other breeding pairs of Amazons. The parents had
a craving for dandelions, loving the flowers, plus fruit and
vegetables.
We knew from the food intake that the chick was alive. The
question in our minds was whether it was alone. As time went by
we became even more convinced that it was single chick and as
long as food was taken to the box we were not going to interfere.
Perhaps if we are fortunate enough to breed the species in the
future, more inspections will take place, but this is something
which will have to be evaluated.
The great day arrived on 22nd August when a chick was seen
looking out of the nestbox. It fledged six days later on 28th August.
It was seen feeding itself on 10th September. The fate of the second
chick and the remaining egg is unknown.
The young bird was sexed that autumn and proved to be a male.
It has less red on the head and a face that is best described as a
diluted version of its parents. It is a very attractive bird.
At the time of writing (April 1995) it has gained more colour. It
may well be that as it continues to colour in the years ahead,, we will
be able to work out how old its parents were when they arrived here.
The young bird spent the 1994/5 winter alone in a smaller aviary but

Pair 'A' have done nothing other than play around in their
nestbox.
For those interested, this is believed to be a first UK and
European breeding, and possibly a world 'first'. The Stud Book for
the Red-tailed Amazon is kept by Dr. H. Lucher, Director of Zoo
Dresden. In addition to the birds at Rode, others of the species are
held at Loro Parque, Palmitos Parque, Zoo Dresden and the World
Parrot Trust at Hayle (Cornwall).
There may, of course, be other birds in other hands and anyone
who is aware of such birds is asked to get in touch with the Stud
Book Co-ordinator.
The following is an extract from an HM Customs and Excise
press release dated 11th August 1994 -
One pair of Red-tailed Amazon parrots, seized together with
nine similar birds by Customs in East Anglia during 1991, and
subsequently housed at The Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, near
Bath, have recently successfully produced a chick which will
shortly leave its nest. This is very good news for Red-tailed
Amazons as they are considered threatened with extinction and
prohibited from being exported from their native Brazilian habitat.
Trade in the birds is more generally prohibited by their being listed
in Appendix 1 (the highest category of protection) of the Conven-
tion on International Trade in Endangered Species, to which the
UK and many other states are signatories.
Customs are delighted that the birds have prospered at Rode and
look forward to hearing offurther chicks being produced to add to,
rather than diminish, the world&apos;s population of parrots.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING IN A SMALL COLONY OF

Flamingos have been displayed for decades in captivity. Con-
sidering the number of specimens and groups, there has been little
success in reproduction. Efforts to adapt the environment and
management of relatively small flocks of Greater Flamingos
Phoenicopterus ruber have been successful in breeding this spe-
cies. Simulating large flocks with the use of walled mirrors,
adequate substrate, sufficient lighting, privacy and proper nutri-
tion are believed to be major factors in reproducing small flamingo
groups in captivity.
Considering the number of flamingo Phoenicopterus sp. groups
listed in the International Species Information System (ISIS) Bird
Abstract, it is surprising that captive reproduction is still erratic.
Independent of species, 5,214 flamingos, distributed in 147 groups,
were listed in the December 1992 Abstract. Forty-three of these
groups reproduced in 1992, for a total of 136 hatchings. This poor
breeding performance indicates the need to improve the captive
management of flamingos. This short paper describes our practical
experience in maintaining and breeding a relatively small group of
Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber at the Granby Zoological
Garden.
Captive Environment
Canada is obviously not the ideal place for flamingos. Seasonal
temperature variations are so large that Canadian institutions who
decide to keep flamingos outdoor in summer need an alternative
enclosure for winter months. Preferably, summer and winter
quarters should be designed to give birds the opportunity to walk in
and out when seasons change. However in Granby, we have to catch
the birds twice a year to relocate them. This is certainly stressful
but no injury has occured so far. Winter housing temperatures in
Granby are held near 21*Celcius.
The winter and breeding housing is relatively small: the flock
has access to 36.2 m 2 of which 36% is water (figure 1). The pond
is divided in two levels. A shallow area (10cm deep, 30 cm wide)

outlines the deeper portion of the pond (37.5 cm). The junction is
progressive so birds can walk easily in and out. The pond is made
of concrete and is surrounded by a 7.5 cm high wooden edge to keep
nesting substrate out of the water.
The thickness of the nesting substrate varies from 7.5 cm to
almost 1 m. where nests are erected. Flamingos are quite unique
nest builders. They build monticules of soft, damp material. We
provide a peatmoss and straw mix and keep it constantly and
appropriately damp. Other institions have used mud or sea sand
mixed with a little clay or earth to bind (Kear, 1974) which is also
successful. Nesting substrate is offered indoors and outdoors but
so far flamingos have only been interested in breeding indoors.
The humidity level of the substrate is re-evaluated twice a day
by keepers. Showers (simulated rain) are not sufficient to keep the
substrate damp. Perforated hoses are run under the substrate's
surface so keepers can control the humidity. In the winter housing,
the ceiling sprinkler is turned on twice a day for approximately one
minute. Because rain sprinklers have no significant effect on the
frequency of group display behaviour (Stevens, 1991), keepers
have discontinued this practice when birds begin to build their
nests. However, we have found that temperate showers are useful
in keeping the substrate damp and plumage clean. In the summer,
natural sunlight is more than sufficient. Flamingos prefer to stand
in a sunny area of their enclosure and rarely stand in the shade.
Appropriate winter housing lighting is important. Both quality and
quantity must be planned carefully. Wide-spectrum fluorescent
lighting (Spectralite) is used for the flamingo group in Granby.
Natural daylight in our region is less than 10 hours per day in
January. We artificially alter the photoperiod in order to stimulate
the birds to reproduce (courtship, nest building, egg-laying,
incubation ...) before relocating them to their summer enclosure for
public viewing; we initiate an &quot;early" spring. In January, indoor
lights are on 11 hours a day and then, 15 minutes are added weekly
until 14 hours of light per day is provided (mid-March). High
pressure sodium lighting (Lumalux 150 watts) also varies under the
same protocol. This very bright light simulates sunrays and
occasionally the birds are seen facing the lights sunning themselves
with their wings opened. These lights, which are approximately
3 m. from the floor produce this particular light that appears to be
sporadically attractive to the flamingos.

sexed by measures of tarsal length (Richter, 1991: Studer-Thiersch,
1986) and confirmed by laparoscopy. All flamingos (except last
year's male chick) were acquired as adults 14 years ago. It has been
reported that all captive Caribbean flocks over 20 birds have
successfully reared chicks (Pickering, 1992). However, the small-
est Greater Flamingo flock known to rear a chick was one of 14
birds (Pickering et al, 1992). The size of our flamingo group could
constitute a serious handicap to our efforts to breed the species in
Granby. To simulate a larger flock of birds, we installed mirrors
on three of the walls surrounding the nesting area of the winter
quarters (figure 1). When exposed to the mirrors, the birds almost
immediately began to display. The mirror's effect lured them into
believing there were many more than were really present.

To keep birds in the outdoor enclosure, the flight feathers of one
wing are trimmed (Sedgewick, 1967) in late spring, at the time of
their relocation from the winter housing to the outdoor enclosure,
except for three females and three males that have had one wing
partially amputated. Unfortunately, our observations don&apos;t permit
at this point to elaborate on pair fidelity. Records of pairing prior
to 1992 are not available. The Granby Zoological Garden is
seasonally opened to the public (May to September). Furthermore,
access to the flamingo winter housing is restricted to a very few
personnel. It is important to minimise disturbance. Keeper obser-
vations are possible from an unidirectional glass window (figure 1).
The pool is cleaned on a daily basis and feed is offered at the
same time. Mirrors are hosed regularly until the birds begin to lay
their eggs. The Flamingos are fed a specialised commercial diet
(Zeigler flamingo fancier diet) developed to replace supplements
of shrimp, fish and colouring agents. It contains a minimum of 22%
crude protein, a minimum of 5% crude fat, a minimum of 15%
moisture, 2860 kcal/kg metabolizable energy, a maximum of 4.5%
crude fibre and a maximum of 6.5% ash. In nature, flamingos feed
on items that contain very high levels of protein such as the blue-
green algae Spirulina, which is 60% protein (dry weight) (Kear,
1986). Considering the potential need of higher protein intake to
stimulate the birds to breed, we provided a higher protein diet.
From February until hatching time, their diet is changed to a second
commercial flamingo diet: Mazuri flamingo breeder. This diet
consists of not less than 34% crude protein and a minimum of 5%
crude fat, no more than 7% crude fibre, a maximum 12% ash and
3.5% added mineral. Mazuri flamingo breeder tends to be accepted
when moistened in water and Zeigler flamingo fancier diet is
accepted dry and subsequently, moistened by the birds. Generally,
the food is presented in a raised trough over the pond, and when
young chicks are present, in a dish placed on the ground. To
minimise disturbance of the nesting area and spoiling of food, dry
Zeigler flamingo fancier diet is placed in a dish. Finally during the
past year we identified each specimen with large engraved numbers
in two-layer laminated coloured plastic leg bands (Shannon, 1992)
and closely monitored the pairs.

caily played with the substrate, forming small mounds. During the
winter of 1989-1990, lighting timers (protocol described earlier)
were installed and man-made nests were built to stimulate birds to
nest. Copulation was observed in May and one egg was laid in June.
Unfortunately, the egg was infertile. In August 1990, it was
decided to change the &quot;traditional&quot; in-house flamingo diet for a
commercial one. Later that same year, mirrors were installed on
three walls and finally, high pressure sodium lights were fixed on
the ceiling. Again, no chick hatched but one egg was definitely
fertile (dead embryo).
In the winter of 1991 - 1992, four eggs were laid, 16th April, 3rd
and 4th May and 8th June. Unfortunately, it was not possible to
clearly identify each parent from a distance. Finally on 14th May
1992, the first flamingo hatched at the Granby Zoological Garden.
The 1992 - 93 winter was even more promising: 12 of the 15 birds
were paired (14 adults and the 1992 subadult) six females laid eggs
and three of them laid twice. The proportion of birds relaying after
losing an egg during incubation depends of the season and whether
the egg was lost naturally or removed by the staff (Pickering, 1992).
In Granby, relaying was induced when eggs were lost (buried in the
nest, or in one case rolled down by a competitive neighbouring
pair). Again, only one chick hatched and all other eggs were
infertile.
The proven-breeder male is one of the partially amputated birds.
This observation eliminates the possibility of complete failure to
copulate because of amputation. There are reports that flamingos
held full-winged had a higher breeding success rate (Pickering,
1992).
As described in this paper, the captive winter housing environ-
ment changed progressively over the past years. We cannot
identify the precise factor that initiated breeding in our flamingo
group. However, we believe the key to successful captive breeding
of this species which nests naturally in a large colony is to simulate
the social environment of the colony, in this case through the use
of mirrors to &quot;multiply&quot; the apparent size of the flock. Knowledge
of natural biology, imagination and innovation can yield successful
captive breeding of species that still reproduce erratically in
captivity.

By Dulcie Cooke, (Epsom, Surrey)
The grace and beauty of Charmosyna papou goliathina, usually
known in the UK as Stella's Lorikeet makes it one of the most
desirable of all aviary subjects.
The true Stella's can be found in Joseph Forshaw's Parrots of
the World under the title Charmosyna papou stellae, but in my third
edition of this great work he points out that papou goliathina is also
called Stella's Lorikeet.
In their wild state these birds inhabit forested areas of the
mountains of central New Guinea, at between 1500 m and 3500 m.
There are two forms of these birds, the strikingly beautiful red, and
the melanistic, whose feathers have a velvety texture seen in few
other birds.
The red cock has a red head, face and body, the lower breast and
&quot;trousers" are black, the wings are green, the tail is green and
yellow, there is a brilliant blue patch on the rump and the feet are
pink to scarlet. The eyes are orange and the beak is red, almost
crimson at times in healthy adult birds. There is no problem sexing
Stella's, the red hen has a large amount of deep golden yellow on
her rump and she also carries the lovely blue on her back between
the yellow feathers. Both birds have a large black patch on the back
of the head in the centre of which is a cluster of green and blue
feathers which can be slightly raised at times.
In the melanistic form the red is replaced by velvety black which
gleams in the sunlight and often in the case of the cock there is a
strong hint of red in the feathers on the breast. It is the cock which
has a different colour on his rump, a brilliant scarlet or crimson
which shows every time he flies, making him a most outstandingly
beautiful bird. The eyes and feet, also the beak are the same colours
as for the red form, but in the case of the melanistic the patch on the
back of the head in both cocks and hens is bright blue, much
brighter and lighter than on the red birds.
Stella's are extremely playful active birds which not only need
plenty of flying space and branches to play with, but they also spend
quite a lot of time on the ground, playing and rolling over and over
like puppies. This and the climbing they do makes their tail
feathers break when they are young. It may be necessary to pull out
broken feather to allow others to grow. In reasonably mild or warm

weather a daily light spray with a plant sprayer helps.
A flight 3mxlmx2m high is suitable. It is advisable to lay
paving or ornamental stones on the floor, one quarter of an inch
apart to allow for drainage. Double wiring is essential because the
birds spend so much time clambering up and down the wire sides of
their aviary, also their extremely incurved toes and claws make
them quite unable to get off the wire quickly in case of danger. It
is best to cover the flight roof with P.V.C. corrugated sheets,
allowing a good &quot;drop&quot; for drainage.
My late husband always built a low wall of ornamental stone-
coloured bricks round each flight and into this he rawlplugged the
aviary panels. The appearance is pleasant, the aviaries do not blow
away in gales and storms, and the birds feel secure when they are
on the ground. With such fast moving birds double doors (an
entrance porch) is really essential.
A house 1 m square is quite sufficient, but it should be a whole
house, one going right down to the ground, we found over the years
that Stella's would not go into their nest boxes in a &quot;half&apos; house
where they must be placed on the floor of the house. It seems that
they want to feel there is space and air under the box. Given a nest
box in a whole house even very young Stella's will learn to use the
box at night, thus keeping themselves warm. I believe it is very
necessary in cold climates, such as in the UK, to interline the roof
with plywood and about 4 in. (10 cm) of insulating material.
On the subject of nest boxes I have come to the conclusion that
Stella's like very big boxes; mine are 11 in. (28 cm) square by 2 in.
(60 cm) deep, with of course a ladder and inspection door. The
entrance hole needs to be large, 2Vi - 3 in. (7 - 8 cm) and wood
shavings to a depth of about 6 in. (15 cm) are needed.
My Stella's have always bred in nest boxes hung in their houses,
they breed round the year once they start at about three-and-a-half
to four years of age. There is a much better chance of rearing winter
babies if tubular heating is installed and the temperature kept to
about 60* F. A low light at night is essential to enable the parents
to feed their young early and late.
The two eggs take about 24 days to hatch and from the second
or third day onwards it is necessary to clean out the top few handfuls
of wood shavings and replace them with clean warm ones. The
babies are best put in a warmed tissue-lined box while this work is
completed. At about nine to ten weeks the young will leave the
nest, sometimes a little earlier. The parents are good-tempered
with their young, but they should be removed at once if the hen

starts to lay again.
In a lifetime of keeping so many kinds of birds I know of very
few with such extraordinarily expressive eyes as Stella's Lorikeets.
Delight, affection, love of their owner and of each other, anger, fear
and frustration are all there for the observant and understanding
person to see. Of course, too, the swaying body of the female says
clearly, don&apos;t come near me or my babies! The only exception to
this is when she wants her babies made clean and warm for the day;
but be warned, either or both parents in some cases can be very
aggressive when they are breeding. If this is the case, wear glasses
to protect the eyes and a glove on one hand.
Stella's are not such avid chewers of wood as many lories and
lorikeets but nevertheless they enjoy small branches of willow,
hazel nut or sweet apple. They will chew the bark thereby giving
themselves a dose of Biotin which I understand is just below the
bark. Biotin helps to prevent rickets. The greatest treat one can
give these birds is a small bunch of flowers wired to a perch with
very thin wire, the birds get tremendous pleasure from extracting
the nectar, eating the pollen and in some cases the petals. Many
garden shrubs and flowers are poisonous, for example, every part
of the rhododendron is poisonous. The following can safely be
given to the birds: forget-me-nots, wallflowers, pansies, bedding
begonias, impatiens (busy lizzies), fuchsias, antirrhinums, roses
and white bedding alyssum. All bulbs should be avoided.
There are many excellent nectars and dry foods on the market,
but I have always made up my own mixtures, both dry food, of
which Stella's are very fond, and nectar. Dry food must always be
placed near to a water container and needs to be changed daily.
Nectar is fed fresh and warm twice daily and three times daily when
the parents have young in the nest. The following are the nectar and
dry food mixtures I have used for some years now with success. It
will be noticed that there is no soya flour in my mixtures, I believe
Stella's are better without this food. Both dry food and nectar
mixtures contain approximately 13% protein.

days. Put one tablespoonful per two birds in a container next to
water and change daily. Some birds like a few tiny pieces of sweet
apple on top.
Nectar
To make approximately one pint of nectar:
One handful (1 oz.) Sainsbury's instant hot oat
cereal
(other pre-cooked cereals
could be used)
Half a level tablespoonful (about one third of an oz.)
muscavado medium or light
brown sugar
One tablespoonful (1 oz.) glucose or dextrose
One tablespoonful (one third of an oz.)
liquidised peeled and cored
sweet apple.
One teaspoonful pure honey
Mix all together with a little cold water, then add boiling water
to bring to anything between three quarters of a pint and one and a
quarter pints which will make a fairly thin mixture suitable for
Stella's in mild and warm weather; it needs to be a little thicker in
cold weather. Give to the birds warm at the rate of 150 to 200
milligrams per two birds; this is assuming they are being fed twice
per day, three times when breeding. Into each container put two
sugar cube sized pieces of sponge cake. Anything left over will be
a &quot;sludge&quot; which can be put into a bowl and given to the wild birds,
they will all enjoy this food.
To the above mixture, in one feed twice per week, add one large
teaspoonful of Boots or other malt with cod liver oil. In one feed
per day, add one tablespoonful of Birdquest's high protein nectar,
made up according to their instructions, it needs fast heating to
dissolve the &quot;bubbles&quot;. The only time the birds do not receive the
high protein nectar is the first three days of babies' lives. Some-
times young hens start to lay at too early an age for the good of their
future health, in this case stop giving the high protein nectar until
they are fully matured.
Young Stella's breeding for the first time often make mistakes
like all other birds. The cock is supposed to do his share of brooding
the eggs, usually in the day, but young cocks very often neglect
their duties! This means that the poor young hen gets all the sitting
to do, gets hungry and tired and often leaves the nest, sometimes
just as the babies are about to hatch. Some pairs will &quot;kick their

eggs around&quot; and then desert them. One reason is that the box may
be too small, and another reason is if the owner or carer disturbs the
birds too m uch out of anxiety to know whether or not they are laying
or sitting. Provided that the nest box is reasonably dry, leave the
birds alone, they will both come and tell their owner when they
want some attention paid to them in the form of praise and encour-
agement for their efforts! All lories and lorikeets want praise etc.
at the right time, and Stella's are no exception. Only when it is
obvious that there are young in the box must it be cleaned out
(partially) each day.
Stella's have very volatile personalities and during brooding
and for the first two weeks of the babies' lives they can be
extremely aggressive, so the owner or carer needs in the case of
some pairs to wear glasses to protect the eyes and a glove on one
hand.
A small piece of green lettuce leaf well washed is given to the
birds daily round the year, and to this is added any of the flowers
mentioned when available.
Finally a word of warning, never buy a Stella with a white beak,
either the bird is old, has been given too many antibiotics, or he or
she is suffering from fatty liver or something similar. The best way
to obtain birds is from known breeders, which may mean waiting for
them.
These beautiful, affectionate and intelligent birds will amply
repay their owner for the care and attention which they so much
deserve.

Introduction
In 1984 I moved from Tokyo to London. During the four years
in Japan I kept many birds but only managed to keep one species of
munia, the Java Sparrow. For the next five years in England I
managed to acquire several species of munia for study purposes.
Then, from 1989 to 1995, I lived in the territory of Hong Kong.
During this time I spent a considerable amount of time researching
for a monograph on the genus Lonchura (Restall in pub.) I
maintained an extensive collection of munias for direct observa-
tions, and made observations in the field in most of the countries of
Asia Pacific and South Africa. During this time I recorded several
instances of unusual behaviour which are described below. It is
quite possible that earlier workers have recorded some or even all
of these before, and I have missed them. I have given acknowledge-
ments wherever directly attributable.
Wing-raising in Asian Munias.
The wing-raising behaviour of the Spermestes subgenus of
African mannikins is well recorded (e.g. Morris 1958, and others).
It may occur when a juvenile is begging to be fed. It may be
possible that by raising the far-side wing, the juvenile is commu-
nicating an impression of larger size, and is thereby increasing the
stimulus to the parent to feed it. This thesis is supported by
evidence in other groups of birds such as the case of the European
Cuckoo, where it seems the larger size of the baby, possibly in some
way representing the sum visual stimulus of several babies, stim-
ulates the foster parents to abnormal efforts to satisfy its hunger. In
a brood competitive situation the larger birds get fed first, and this
too may be the key factor in the wing-raising behaviour among
mannikins, the wing-raising effectively obscuring the other fledg-
lings from view. Wing-raising may also occur in an aggression-
defence situation, when the raising of the far-side wing increases
the apparent size of the bird being attacked and will thus intimidate
or inhibit the other bird from aggression by communicating that its
opponent is bigger than was realised. Wing-raising appears to have
been recorded only in the Pectoral Mannikin among the Asian
munias. I have observed wing-raising in three other species of
munia in Asia, as follows.

I first saw wing-raising as a defence behaviour by the Philippine
Scaly-breasted Munia Lonchura punctulata cab an isi on two differ-
ent occasions. In each case, the wing-raising bird was a first year
male in a cage with a second year male White-bellied Munia L.
leucogastra. The White-bellied Munia had approached the other
bird suddenly, almost certainly due to my presence startling it,
which in turn startled the Scaly-breasted Munia into an immediate
defence behaviour since it had nowhere to fly to. The birds in
question were at the time in a cage in my studio in Hong Kong.
Subsequently, under fairly similar circumstances, I observed two
different adult Brown-headed Munias wing-raising against per-
ceived threats from other munias. Interesting perhaps is that in
none of these cases was the threat actually real, and I saw no actual
aggression.
The third instance occurred in northern Sulawesi where I was on
a business trip, in February, 1995. I had the opportunity to observe
a small colony of Chestnut Munias L. atricapilla jagori in the
grounds of the hotel where I was staying in Manado. There were
four or possibly five broods of newly-fledged munias, 17 in all, that
formed what amounted to a creche. They stayed close together,
would hop about the lawn in an area covering a few square metres,
but most of the time would sit in rows on the uppermost, fairly bare
branches of two small bougainvillea bushes in the lawn. These
bushes were small enough and low enough, and the fledglings so
new to the world and innocent, that I was able to slowly walk up to
one bush and pick off one of the babies with my hand. It still had
soft papillae at the corners of the gape and could only have fledged
a day or two earlier. I was able to sketch the gape markings of this
bird. I estimated all 17 fledglings to be about the same age,
suggesting an interesting synchronisation of nesting behaviour.
They would sit quietly waiting until an adult appeared with clear
intent to feed. It would invariably land at one end of the
bougainvillea branch and the baby bird nearest would immediately
assume a begging posture, head down and twisted upwards. After
feeding it briefly, whereupon the intensity of the begging would
reduce, the next fledgling in line would usually intensify its
begging. On one occasion I saw the bird being fed raise its far wing
in exactly the manner of a fledgling African mannikin, effectively
blocking the next bird in-line from view as well as enhancing its
own visual impact. I saw this again on two more occasions, but was
uncertain of the accuracy of my observations the third time. This
was because of the agitated crowding of the next bird in line, I could

not be certain the wing-raising bird was not simply the feeding bird
trying to maintain its balance.
Creche Feeding
The Chestnut Munias in the garden of the Manado hotel formed
several small colonies within each of which the breeding behaviour
was apparently perfectly synchronised. Each colony was not
necessarily in sync with the next one however. In one there was
much displaying and singing, including peering, with males bring-
ing thin lengths of palm leaves and females coming to the entrances
of the nests to see what was going on. In the small colony outside
the dining room balcony, from which I made most of my observa-
tions, only a few adults were in evidence. As far as I could tell only
three adults were regularly feeding the 17 fledglings, (baby birds
that had very recently left the nest). At least three adults were
spending considerable time in the nests, possibly the females
renovating. I think there were eight adults in all, with four nests,
each in a different bamboo bush. After watching the feeding
process many times I came to the conclusion that a visiting adult,
whilst it almost certainly began by flying to one of its own brood,
would feed whichever fledgling was next in the begging line. I
managed to keep visual tabs on several individual fledglings and
was sure that at least two had been fed by each of the three feeding
adults. In my field notes I called it the Soup Kitchen Syndrome, but
the fact that the baby birds behaved absolutely as if they were in a
well-ordered creche prompts me to call this behaviour Creche
Feeding. This behaviour is not unknown in aviculture, where adults
have been seen to feed, sometimes regularly, begging fledglings of
other species. But the observations described here were under
perfectly natural conditions. I understand from my friend Derek
Goodwin, who offered some pertinent comments on this paper, that
when birds in a situation like this have been marked, and identifi-
cation quite certain, only the feeding bird's own young are volun-
tarily fed. As described above in the section on wing-raising, in at
least two or three instance, it was the action of the wing-raising
fledgling that enabled it to be fed by blocking the view of the bird
next in line, and not that the feeding bird simply "went down a line
in the soup kitchen", even though that was the impression given.
Cavity defence head-twisting.
While living in Japan I decided to try the Japanese technique of
hand-rearing young finches and bought a pair of, about, 10-day old
Java Sparrows. These I reared easily by means of a purpose-made
tubular syringe sold in pet shops. The two thrived and grew into

healthy young birds. They showed no fear of me or my family, and
behaved almost as if they were imprinted onto humans. When they
moulted into first adult plumage however, they lost their trust in us
and behaved just like normal domestic Java Sparrows. They did not
show fear of us, but avoided contact, would not be touched or
picked up and were so independent that they had to be permanently
caged.
One day, while working on the balcony where the cages were
kept, I turned the corner and confronted one of the Java Sparrows
as it sat in a small study cage facing me. Normally, a bird would
turn and hop or fly to a further perch in an instinctive gesture of
escape-intention, most munias would fly to the bars on the side of
the cage and cling there while evaluating the situation. On this
occasion, the Java Sparrow lowered itself on the perch, crouching
slightly, and, looking directly at me, moved its head deliberately.

twisting it from side to side. In this manner it presented first one
side of the head, then the other. I stood still and after only a few
movements the head-twisting stopped. I then took a small step
towards the bird and it repeated the display. I was able to provoke
the head-twisting by leaning forward, and having it cease by
leaning back and ceasing movement. When I stepped deliberately
closer the bird flew back off the perch and that was the end of it.
The behaviour was noted in my bird diary and forgotten until an
identical behaviour occurred with a captive Japanese Great Tit that
I was painting. I found that this bird would regularly give me the
same display, which I take to be derived from a nest cavity defence
behaviour.
Cock's nest
It is well known (e.g.. Goodwin 1982, and others) that most of
the Estrilda waxbills build an unusually complex double-cham-
bered nest. The nest cavity, within which the eggs are laid, hatched
and the young reared, is in the main structure. Above this is a
smaller comparatively incomplete structure that is used by the male
to roost in. Some mannikins build nests for roosting in, some of
which are decidedly communal in their use. But these are not used
for breeding purposes. They are quite separate and apart from the
nests built for breeding. The cock's nest of the Estrilda variety has
not been previously recorded for any species of Lonchura. There
have been three instances of cock's nests being built by munias in
my bird room, that I describe below.
The first case was the Timor Sparrow L. fuscata. A pair went to
nest in a typical wooden nest box of the kind used for breeding
lovebirds. This box was about two metres from the ground, near to
the door into the birdroom. The male Timor Sparrow would lie up
in the cavity nearest the entrance, while the female brooded the
eggs in the nest chamber proper, further within the box. Whenever
I entered the room, within a moment the male would fly out of the
box and off into the main aviary. The female remained inside. If
I were to enter very quietly, with intent to see the bird actually
depart the nest, I would see him suddenly appear at the entrance
hole and then depart. On just two occasions I was able to see him
actually roosting, eyes closed, in the cock's nest cavity. When
taken apart, the chamber used by the male was unlined, that of the
breeding chamber fully lined with tiny soft bents and fibres.
The second case was with a pair of Java Sparrows L. oryzivora ,
and also occurred in my establishment when I lived in London. The
birds were in a complex that consisted of an indoor flight some two

metres cubed, with an outdoor garden flight about five metres long.
Inside the house I had placed an artificial hollow log nest box,
constructed from slabs of Spanish Oak bard, intended for a pair of
Grosbeak Starlings Scissirostrum duhium. The starlings did take to
the nest with obvious pleasure and some excited calling, and began
carrying straws to it. The Java Sparrows decided to take over the
box and managed to evict the starlings without much difficulty.
There were other boxes available, including another log box of a
horizontal design, but these were never taken seriously by either
species. Subsequently I removed this nest and dismantled it.
Inside, the Java Sparrows had built a double cavity nest. In design
it was similar to that of the Timor Sparrows, only vertical. The
main cavity below was fully lined, the upper one only rough straws
and grasses. I do not know if this nest was used as a cock's nest.
In the case of a munia using a box, it would be normal for the cavity
to be filled with straws until a nest chamber could be constructed
just within the entrance. The nature of the design in this instance
suggests the double chamber was deliberate.

A third case was with the Black-rumped Munia L. leucogcistroides
(Restall 1987). Five birds were kept in a large breeding cagel.83 m
long that contained a large flattened roll of garden fence plastic
mesh that had been fixed to the rear wall of the cage. This had been
loosely stuffed with straw. It is a wonderful device that I first saw
in Mike Fidler's birdroom and had copied. The birds find it
irresistible, and are guaranteed to build nests in it. One of the pairs
built a nest at one end that quite definitely had two cavities, the first
being unlined and apparently used by the male in a similar way to
the male Timor sparrow as described above.

a pair of the author's Black-rumped Munias built a twin chambered nest.
There are no records of analyses of Lonchura nests built in holes in
trees or other cavities for it to be known whether this was the kind
of aberrant behaviour of birds in captivity that does not occur under
natural conditions. The only reference to possible cock's nest
building in munias I have been able to find is in the Queensland
Finch Society handbook (1987), in which it says of the Yellow-
rumped Mannikin L. flaviprymna , The Yellow-rump nest is a
domed structure built from coarse grasses on the outside, with the
inner chamber lined with softer grass ... Sometimes a roost nest is
built above or below the main nest". It is unclear whether this roost
nest is part of the breeding nest structure or separate, but I suspect
it means a rodsting nest nearby.

Peering Enforced Singing.
The phenomenon of peering in munias is well known (e.g..
Moynihan and Hall 1954, Morris, and others). Briefly, it occurs
when a singing male unintentionally attracts the attention of other
birds that stand very close to the singer and appear to peer at it.
These peerers are almost invariably but not exclusively males and
they are almost invariably but not exclusively conspecifics. There
is usually only one peering bird, but sometimes there is one on each
side of the singing bird, and occasionally a third or fourth will stand
in line to await its opportunity. Many species of munias are known
to peer, and it is probable that every species does. The birds in the
genus Lonchura fall mto two groups in terms of the distance they
maintain between each bird when perched together. Those that
clump, that is to say they perch so close to each other that the bodies
actually touch, are known as contact species. Those that maintain
a small space between each bird as they perch are known as spacial
species. In general the Munia subgenus, which includes the Tri-
coloured Munia L. malacca, the Great-billed Mannikin L. grandis
and the Black Mannikin L. stygia , are spacial birds, although I have
seen all of these clumping at some time or other. The Uroloncha
subgenus, which includes the White-rumped Munia L. striata and
the Scaly-breasted Munia L. punctulata are typical of contact
species that will clump together. Contact species will peer very
closely, the bill of the peering bird possibly even touching the bill
of the singing bird. In spacial species the peering bird will keep a
short distance from the performer and never actually touch it.
Peering is not a phenomenon that occurs only in captivity, for I have
seen it in both Chestnut Munias in Indonesia, and Scaly-breasted
Munias in Sri Lanka.
With three species that I have studied in captivity, the Black-
breasted Mannikin L. teerinki, the Great-billed Mannikin and the
Hooded Mannikin L. spectabilis , I have observed on several occa-
sions what can only be described as Peering Enforced Singing.
What happens is that a male bird is sitting quietly, doing nothing
in particular, when another male will fly up and perch alongside.
The newcomer at once stretches and leans onto the unwitting bird
and peers in an overbearing, seemingly threatening way. What
distinguishes this from usual peering is the way the enforcer
actually leans over the singer-to-be. The first bird may shift away
slightly, appearing to be uncomfortable and - at the risk of being
anthropomorphic a little embarrassed - at which the .peerer moves
up, continuing its overhearing importuning. Whether the first bird

shifts or not, it soon begins to sing. It sings in a mechanical way,
without any body movements or apparent enthusiasm, and soon
stops. The importuning peerer immediately and visibly relaxes its
posture to that of normal peering. But when the singing bird stops,
which it is likely to do sooner than when its performance is self-
generated, the enforcer is very likely to repeat its efforts and persist
until the victim sings again. Sometimes it will be forced to sing
several times.

On one occasion a male Hooded Mannikin was perched along-
side a female with which it appeared to be bonded. He sang a strong
undirected song several times, and attracted three other males
which took turns in peering. One of these peering males returned
a few minutes after the episode had finished, and by enforcement
peering induced the singer to perform a few more times. The
unfortunate performer had been pushed up to the female, who in
turn edged along the perch, until the pair were literally squashed
against the bars of the cage. Throughout the entire episode the
female ignored the proceedings, and remained clumped next to her.
mate.
Single-wipe feeding on grass seeds.
In an interesting paper of observations of mannikins in the field
in Papua New Guinea, Baptista (1990) describes seeing a Great-
billed Mannikin taking soft green grass seeds from a pannicle in one
single wipe. The bird appeared to slipe or wipe its bill along the
stem, gathering all the seeds in one go. There is a temptation to
interpret this as an advantageous adaptation by the species, and
explaining perhaps at least one reason for the disproportionately
large bill. For some time I was able to keep nine Great-billed
Mannikins in a large all-wire cage outside the dining room window.
I did everything I could to encourage the birds to use the single wipe
technique by providing seeding grasses of various kinds in a variety
of ways. I never saw them use the single wipe.
Earlier this year I was staying at a hotel outside Manado, in
northern Sulawesi, where I spent a lot of time watching the Chest-
nut Munias referred to earlier in these notes. On one occasion I saw
one of these birds use the seed-wipe to pull several soft green seeds
from the pannicle. The one bird did it twice and another bird used
the single-wipe to take three or four seeds. The grass was short and
was of the Digit aria group.
Sentry duty.
When watching Moluccan Munias L. molucca and Five-col-
oured Munias L. quinticolor feeding in long grass in an area
between the town and the river at Aileu in East Timor, I noted the
occasional munia that did not drop into the grass to feed with the
rest of the flock, but stayed near the tip of a tall stem, very
obviously keeping watch. There were two obvious predators
nearby, a kestrel, and the boys who had successfully collected a pile
of munias' nests from within the grass. I did not note at the time
which of the two munias was the sentry, but I am certain that on
another occasion I did see a Moluccan Munia on watch. A week

later, on the island of Liran, I watched munias several different
times. Typical, was when a flock of several dozen Scaly-breasted
Munias L. punctulata were feeding in grass. There were some-
times, but not always, just a few Pallid Munias L. pallida feeding
with them, and these took it in turns apparently posting sentry. It
was not certain which birds would drop into the grass to feed and
which would stay on a tall stem keeping lookout. It was certain that
the Scaly-breasted Munias never bothered, and when the Pallid
Munias flew off it became possible to approach the flock to within
a few metres. At other times a small flock of Zebra Finches
Poephila guttata would feed in the grass. They were not quite as
alert as the Pallid Munias, but were nowhere near as casual as the
Scaly-breasted Munias.
In northern Sulawesi I watched several species of munia, and
found all of them feeding in a rice paddy on one occasion. This time
it was definitely the Moluccan Munias that were on sentry duty. At
first a few Moluccan Munias would remain on tall exposed stems,
then one by one they would drop down, but there would always be
one that stayed up. Sometimes a bird would come up and be sentry
as well, but it was rare that a sentry would join the feeders. It is
much more difficult to see the sentry duty behaviour in captivity,
unless the birds are in a roomy flight with long grass. However, I
have noticed that on occasions one bird in a high up cage would
remain on a perch, apparently being sentry, while the other birds
dropped out of (my) sight to forage on the cage floor. I have noticed
this with Cream-bellied Munias L . pal liven ter (Restall 1995),
Hooded Mannikins L. spectabilis , and Black-breasted Mannikins L.
teerinki , but never with Chestnut Munias nor Scaly-breasted Muni-
as. It may be that those species that lack any white in their plumage
rely more on being cryptic to potential predators.

AT BIRDWORLD

The Mountain Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron inopinatum oc-
curs naturally in the central mountainous forests of the Malay
peninsula, '...it may be looked for in humid, dark ravines above
three thousand feet' (Beebe, 1922).
Males and females of this species look very similar, the female
being slightly smaller, - especially in the tail - and her colouration
is a little duller. The overall appearance shows a dark grey head
with delicate spots of white. The throat, breast and belly are a
subtle shade of grey brown. It is the upper wing, back and tail
covert colour that links this bird in the generalised group of
'Bronze-tails'. Throughout the shining bronze of the wings and
along the graduated tail are 'eyes' of metallic green, it is these
patches, especially when the males display, that give the appear-
ance of Peacocks.
Four birds, two cocks and two hens were put on loan to Birdworld
by the World Pheasant Association UK early in 1992. Initially,
both pairs were placed in off-display aviaries to settle and indeed
appeared to do so remarkably quickly. The first surprise came
within a month of their arrival when a broken egg was found on the
feeding platform. Sadly on this occasion a second egg, which
makes the usual two-egg clutch, was not produced.
The diet originally given comprised of a commercial pheasant
pellet ration to which mixed seeds such as millet and linseed were
added, together with chopped greens, fruit, livefood and a sprin-
kling of vitamins. A high proportion of these additional foods was
eliminated during the 1994 season, when the birds were given only
a pheasant pellet ration with livefood in the form of mealworms;
vitamins were still used to supplement the diet. The production of
eggs continued and two further clutches, each of a single egg, were
laid by the same hen at 15 and 23 day intervals respectively. The
last egg in 1992 was laid on 1st July, It was in good condition and
taken for incubation in our Incubation Research Station. Unfortu-
nately the embryo died after only a few days.
Laying continued throughout 1993 and 1994, although there
were a few hiccups that defeated production. However, on 23rd
September 1993, after 15 eggs had previously failed, two chicks

were hatched. Unfortunately both died - one at 14 days, the second
after 30 days.
At the beginning of 1994 the males were swapped and we lost the
female which had produced the hatched eggs. Therefore, in March
the remaining male was moved off-display from the Tropical House
to make space for the other pair to be housed there.
Within a day of the birds being transferred an egg was laid - only
the second egg from this particular hen since she had been with her
new partner, although it was her 11th clutch since the beginning of
1993. Two days later a second egg was laid, but this one was broken
when found. After a further 12 days another clutch of two eggs was
laid
Neither the egg from the 11th clutch nor the first egg from the
12th managed to grow completely and it was not until 12th April
that the first chick of 1994 hatched after an incubation period of 22
days. From the remaining seven clutches in 1994, a further 14
chicks were hatched.
Since April 1992 35 eggs have been laid. The average length has
proved to be 49.5 mm, breadth 35.6 mm and weight 34.1 grams.
The first 1994 chick was treated very carefully, primarily
because we anticipated problems with it proving to be quite deli-
cate. On hatching, this particular bird weighed 22 grams from a
whole egg weight at internal pip of 26.8 grams.
On hatching, the young bird's appearance shows a typical
pheasant chick patterning along the back. Although the overall
colour of the natal down was brown, lines of dark and light were
noticeable. The legs were long as is the case with many of the other
Peacock Pheasants, and greyish brown in colour. The eyes were
black and the beak brown.
The chick was brooded at 35/36* C initially, this temperature
being reduced as it aged.
On day 1, food offered to the chick was a moist mash made up
of pheasant starter crumbs and Avi-plus softbill mix. A shallow pot
of this mixture was left in the brooder all day and night. It was
important to replace the food every two hours or so as it quickly
dried, and also to prevent souring. Throughout the day, tweezer-
held white mealworms were offered, as were finely chopped pieces
of clover dipped in water, plus the starter mash.
Day 4 saw a three gram increase in weight as did day 6, at which
time the temperature was held at 28* C. The diet was still the same
with the addition of other green food like lettuce.
By day 23 the youngster weighed 62 grams and its diet was dry

crumb mix, plus millet, given freshly every morning. In addition,
it was offered finely chopped fruits, minced ox heart, mealworms
and chopped greens. Much of the food was now being taken without
the help of tweezer offerings. A few mealworms were also dropped
into the food from time to time to stimulate interest in it.
On day 29 all was still going well. The chick by this time was
well feathered and feeding well. It was deemed time to transfer it
once more to larger accommodation. A 2 ft. by 2 ft. cage was set
up, with newspaper around the sides to prevent external activities
from stressing the chick. Food and water dishes were placed in the
cage as was a suspended heat lamp and twigs of fir trees to provide
cover and perching.
On being moved the young Peacock Pheasant appeared quite
content but unfortunately it died during the following night, possi-
bly due to a combination of increased drafts causing a chill plus
stress incurred by this and the move.
By this time - 10th May 1994 - two more chicks from the next
clutch were already 11 and 13 days old. Until this time they had
been treated in a similar fashion to the first chick, with the possible
exception that we were not being as &apos;over careful&apos; with them and as
a consequence they were feeding independently much earlier. In
addition to the dish of food given to these chicks, mealworms were
dropped into the brooders regularly throughout each day; they were
always taken.
The move from brooder to cage was tried again when this clutch
was about one month old. This time it proved more successful.
By following this regime during 1994 11 chicks were reared to
maturity - followed, so far, by a further four in 1995.

CITES 1 PROTECTION FOR RED AND BLUE LORY
By Roger Sweeney (Loro Parque)
There can be little doubt that during the last four years the wild
population of the Talaud Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio talautensis
has declined alarmingly as a result of the sudden international trade
that developed for the species as an avicultural bird. At the CITES
meeting which took place at Fort Lauderdale at the end of 1994, it
was decided that Eos histrio should be placed in Appendix 1 of
CITES. It can now be hoped that this protection will stop further
capture of wild birds, but the future survival of the species must be
of great concern given the almost complete lack of information
about its wild biology and the true status of the remaining wild
population.
As an important first step towards ensuring the species' surviv-
al, it is planned that this year Dr. Frank lambert, principle investi-
gator for the Species Survival Commission of the IUCN, will
undertake a field assessment of Eos histrio over several months on
the islands of Sangi and Talaud. It is widely speculated that the
nominate subspecies may now be extinct on Sangi.
The main aims of the field study will be to assess the size of the
remaining wild population of Eos histrio , gather biological data
which will help formulate a more accurate picture of the conserva-
tion needs of the species and investigate whether the international
trade in wild birds has indeed been curtailed following placement
of the species in Appendix 1 of CITES.
Two other important endemic birds occur on the island of Sangi,
Lori cuius amabilis catamene , a subspecies of the Moluccan Hang-
ing Parrot L . amabilis , and Aethopyga duyvenbodei , the Elegant or
Sangi Yellow-backed Sunbird. It is hoped the project will allow
status and biological data to be collected also on these birds.
The Loro Parque Foundation will act as principle funder of this
IUCN project by providing $14,000 - which amounts to 50% of the
total cost. Other funding is being provided by several smaller
groups such as the Zoologische Gesellschaft fur arten - und
populationsschutz, the International Loriidae Society and the AZ
organisation in Germany. Field work is planned to begin in 1995
and the results should be published in 1996.
There are small numbers of Eos histrio talautensis in Europe and
the USA, and what are believed to be rather larger stocks in South

the future survival of the species, Loro Parque is preparing a

Although no new buildings have been opened at the zoo this
year, refurbishment and upgrading of existing aviaries continues
apace - particularly in and around the Bird House. At the same time
we have continued to upgrade the collection, deleting those species
that do not fit the zoo's Mission Statement and replacing them,
where possible, with species that are both threatened in the wild and
which will inspire commitment to the conservation of nature in our
ivisitors. Thus we have recently added two pairs of Siamese
Fireback Pheasants Lophura diardi and two pairs of Palawan
Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron emphanum, while removing some
of the commoner pheasant species from the collection. We have
also imported a male Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis from
Antwerp Zoo to pair with our lone female.
The large Southern Aviary has been cleared of waterfowl which
were causing considerable damage to the vegetation. The aviary
has now been re-turfed and the zoo's flock of Abdim's Storks
Ciconia abdimii has been transferred there. In addition, a small
group of Little Egrets Egretta garzetta , recently imported from
Emmen Zoo, and three Yellow-billed Storks Mycteria ibis , re-
ceived from Bristol and Lisbon Zoos, have been placed in the
aviary. It is hoped to develop small colonies of a number of stork
and heron species as the aviary offers them both plenty of space and
height, and a large variety of nesting places. We received a group
of four 1994-hatched female Buff-necked Ibis Theristicus caudatus
from Bristol Zoo. These have settled well and can be seen in the
paddocks adjoining the Stork and Ostrich House.
Another growing collection at London Zoo is of Ptilinopus and
Ducula pigeons over the last two years or so, and we have received
single specimens of Zoe Ducula zoeaQ. Blue-tailed D. concinna,
Pinon D. pi non and Purple-tailed Imperial Pigeons
D. rufigaster. All these species are very rare in captivity in the UK
and mates are currently being sought outside the country.
Finally, a pair of Red-tailed Black Cockatoos Calyptorhynchus
magnificus have recently completed quaranteine and are on exhibit
in the new Macaw Aviary.
The zoo recently sent two female new Guinea Mountain Pigeons
Gymnophaps albertisii to Vogelpark Walsrode in Germany. These

appear to have been the only birds of the species in the UK and, as
the European stock is very small, Walsrode is attempting to estab-
lish them in captivity. The zoo's birds were a contribution to this
effort.
With regard to the zoo's breeding programmes, 1995 has been
a good 'owl year' to date. Five species were hatched including the
usual Boobook Ninox novaeseelandiae and White-faced Scops
Owls Otus leucotis, but pride of place must go the the three
Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata which were hand-reared
during April. The zoo also hatched two Collared Scops Owls
O. bakkamoena and a Ural Owl Strix uralensis , both species for the
first time. Unforunately the Ural did not survive, but Green
Imperial Pigeons D. aenea and Black-backed Fruit Doves Ptilinopus
cincta have hatched and reared chicks, while Black-footed Pen-
guins Spheniscus demersus have been as productive as usual with
10 chicks reared to date.
A first for London Zoo was the fledging of a Silver-throated
Tanager Tangara icterocephala. Black-cheeked Lovebirds
Agapornis nigrigensis, donated last year by the Lovebird Society as
part of a managed breeding programme for this endangered species,
have fledged three chicks. Other species that bred last year, and
have repeated their success in 1995, include Gough Island Moorhen
Gallinula comeri. Fairy Lorikeet Charmosyna pulchella and Red-
crowned Crane Grus japonensis.
The Breeding of the Black-backed Fruit Dove Ptilinopus cinctus
at London Zoo, reported in the Avicultural Magazine 1994: 189 -
191, is probably the first successful breeding in this country.
Anyone who knows of a previous breeding in the U.K. is asked to
inform the Hon. Secretary.

VISIT TO BIRDWORLD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962106" page_id="56270603"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
By Stewart Pyper (Frorne, Somerset)
Members visited Birdworld, Farnham (Surrey) earlier this year.
Although numbers were low, those who attended greatly enjoyed
themselves on a fine, warm spring day. Birdworld continues to
grow and the recently opened Heron Theatre is a big attraction.
There is plenty of space to walk and view the birds, and aviaries
blend well against a background of trees and shrubs. The Penguin
Pool always attracts crowds and the occasion of our visit was no
exception.
The collection of birds is vast - Ostrich to Hornbills, Lories to
Doves. Mountain Witch Doves once appeared in a number of UK
collections but numbers have now declined. At Birdworld, howev-
er, we saw three pairs and an odd cock. One of the pairs was sitting.
Rob Harvey, who now runs Birdworld, explained that his birds
will only sit indoors in a heated aviary - but to remain in tip-top
condition they must have access to an outside flight.
Birdworld has excelled in the incubation and hand-rearing of all
kinds of birds. We were allowed into the off-display rearing area
where we saw Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants which are the
subject of an article in this issue of the Avicultural Magazine. Last
year the Yellow-fronted Woodpecker bred at Birdworld.
During lunch, Oliver Tynan of the National Council for Avicul-
ture gave a short talk about the council's present work.

DARTFORD'S NUMBERS INCREASE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991231588235294" page_id="56270604"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
The results of a survey of Dartford Warblers Sylvia undata in the
UK show that there has been a four-fold increase in the population
over the last 10 years. The survey, conducted by the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds, and English Nature, recorded a total of
between 1,600 - 1,670 breeding territories in southern England.
As well as increasing in numbers, the species has spread,
recolonising Berkshire, Cornwall and Devon, and breeding in
Somerset for the first time. The main strongholds are Dorset with
650 pairs and Hampshire with about 600 pairs. They also breed in
East and West Sussex, the Isle of Wight and Surrey.
Severe winters are one of the main factors which adversely
affect the Dartford Warbler's population in the UK where it is at the
most northerly edge of its range which extends across France,
Spain, Portugal, Andorra, Italy and as far as North Africa. The
Spanish population is decreasing due to a progressive decline in
suitable habitat. It has been identified as one of the species most
likely to benefit from global warming and climate change.

FLOCK PIGEONS FLOURISH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999005333333333" page_id="56270604"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
According to the diaries and journals of Australia's early ex-
plorers, the Flock Bronze-wing Pigeon Phaps histrionica was so
numerous that flocks used to darken the sky over the arid interior
of northern Australia each evening, as they flew to and from rivers
and creeks to drink.
Yet during the late nineteenth century and the early part of this
century, its numbers plummeted and there were some who Feared
it may even have become extinct. Many of the early explorers
survived by eating them, but hunting was not the main reason for
this species' decline. That was due to the widespread introduction
of cattle and the effect they had on its food supply, principally
fallen grass seeds and herbs.
Fortunately, it managed to survive in the more remote parts of
the country and - according to an article in GEO Australasia, Vol.
17, No. 1, and the evidence of the superb photos which illustrate it
- it is flourishing again now in much of its former range. The bore
holes and dams installed to provide water for cattle, mean that the
pigeons no longer have to fly long distances to drink. Moreover, the

STORM WRECKS BRONX AVIARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997484882352941" page_id="56270605"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
Earlier this year, one of the Bronx Zoo's &apos;landmark* exhibits, the
Harry de Jur Aviary, collapsed under the weight of heavy snow.
Constructed in 1899, the huge aviary was renovated in the early
1980s with the assistance of the Harry de Jur Foundation as a
special facility for seabirds. Its habitat recreated the rugged terrain
of Patagonia and a winding path through the aviary took visitors
below a cliff with nesting tunnels for Inca Terns Larosterna inca,
and past a rocky island inhabited by Guanay Cormorants Phalacro-
corax bougainvillei , Andean Gulls Larus serranus , Grey Gulls L.
modestus and Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus.
Although no people or birds were injured in the accident, 33 of
the exhibit's more than 100 seabirds either flew away or were
blown by prevailing high winds. Although one Grey Gull and an
Inca Tern were subsequently recovered, 31 birds remain missing.
With the help of the Harry de Jur Foundation and concerned area
residents, the aviary will be rebuilt and the seabird colonies re-
established as soon as possible.

PICATHARTES SURVEY

In the latest Bulletin of the African Bird Club, Vol. 2, No. 1,
Hazell Shokella Thompson and Roger Fotso, provide an excellent
summary of what is known about the White-necked and Grey-
necked Picathartes or Rockfowl Picathartes gymnocephalus and P.
oreas, and include details of recent research, mainly in Sierra
Leone and Cameroon.
The White-necked species was found in six of the seven forest
reserves surveyed in Sierra Leone. Except for those in the Gola
Forest, where 37 colonies with a total of 190 nests were found, the
number of colonies in each forest was small and each contained
only two nests.
The largest colony ever discovered, consisting of about 47
Grey-necked Picathartes' nests, of which at least 20 were believed
to be occupied, was seen on a single cliff in the Dja Forest Reserve
in Cameroon. Most colonies contain no more than five nests. This
was unusually large, probably because of the scarcity of suitable

In addition, 91 breeding sites, occupied by an estimated 500 -
1,000 Grey-necked Picathartes, were discovered recently in south-
eastern Nigeria. They are, their discoverer, J. S. Ash, believes, like
other colonies throughout West Africa, seriously threatened by
habit destruction and hunting pressure.
The article includes a colour plate, and Peter Wood and Peter J.
Dolton, follow with a sort of twitcher's guide to where to see these

RARE NEST FOUND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99624175" page_id="56270606"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
The first nest of the Crested Eagle Morphnus guianensis in an
area north of Brazil - and only the second nest of the species ever
recorded - has been discovered by biologists from the Peregrine
Fund. The site was reported by a Guatemalan farmer familiar with
the Fund's Maya Project, a study of birds of prey in Guatemala's
rainforests.
Little is known about the species which lives in the dense
tropical forests of Central and South America. It is similar in
appearance to the Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja but is somewhat
smaller and its talons are not as long.
The greatest threat to this and many other birds of prey is slash-
and-burn farming, in which farmers annually cut and burn the forest
for planting. The farmers who occupy land surrounding the Crested
Eagle nest, which was found outside Guatemala's Tikal National
Park, are interested in the birds' welfare and have agreed not to
conduct deforestation nearby.

could be found in the successful hatching of a number of species
including Victoria Crowned Pigeon Goura victoria (one), Ornate

One of the disappointments was the death of the chick from our

<bodyText confidence="0.9963486" page_id="56270608"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
Reports of crane chicks being captured in Cambodia and sold in
Thailand, together with accounts from local people suggesting that
the birds nest in scattered areas in the northern third of Cambodia,
have led to the discovery of three Eastern Sarus Crane Grus
antigone sharpii nests in marshes in north-eastern Cambodia.
The same aerial survey also revealed Giant Ibis Thaumatibis
gigantea - rediscovered 110 km to the north in Laos in 1992 after
an absence of 30 years. The scattered, isolated nature of the
wetlands where the birds were located made them a safe haven for
several species, allowing them to survive years of war.

Published annually by the Zoological Society of London, the
International Zoo Yearbook is required reading for people working
in, or with a specific interest in, the world's leading collections.
Volume 33 is likely to be of value also to many people in aviculture
with a specific interest in aquatic birds, for in section 1 no fewer
than 24 articles are devoted to families which have some associa-
tion with aquatic habitats.
They include material about the Penguin Parade Exhibit at
Jurong BirdPark; Management and Breeding of Pelicans in Captiv-
ity; Captive-breeding and Reintroduction Project for the Milky
Stork at Zoo Negara; Hand-rearing and Breeding the Endangered
Black-winged Stilt; Alcids in North American Zoos and Aquaria;
The Wetland Aviary in Rheine Zoo; and Black Stork Management
in Europe.
In Section 2 (New Developments in the Zoo World) are accounts
of the first hand-rearing of Kakapo at the Auckland Zoological
Park; Breeding Spix's Macaw at Loro Parque; and Reproductive
Biology in King Vultures at the Paris Menagerie.
The Reference Section always provides interesting reading.
Comprehensive details of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians
and fish bred in collections around the world are provided for 1992,
together with a Census of Rare Animals in Captivity (1993). Also
here are details of international studbooks and registers for rare
species of wild animals in captivity.
Among breeding achievements to take my eye (not necessarily
'firsts') were: Golden-headed Trogon (Houston), Malachite King-
fisher (Frankfurt), Black, and Malabar Pied Hornbills (Jurong
Sing), Plate-billed Mountain Toucan (New Orleans), Swallow-
tailed Manakin (Berlin), Barn Swallow (Wuppertal), Red-billed
Oxpecker (Walsrode) and Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise (Rome
CSCP).
In 1993, only two collections were recorded to have Blood

The Hornbilis
Few aviculturists keep Hornbilis, but the number is increasing,
along with captive breeding successes. Only in recent years has it
been possible to see representative collections of these striking
birds, for example at Birdworld in Farnham, San Diego Zoo and
Wild Animal Park and the outstanding collection at Jurong BirdPark
in Singapore. They must have done much to increase interest in
these handsome fruit-eating and omnivorous birds.
Alan Kemp's recently published book The Hornbilis will have
the same effect. The author (Head Curator in the Department of
Birds at the Transvaal Museum) confesses to a 25-year addiction to
hornbilis. This addiction has resulted in a fascinating and well
researched title. His knowledge is impressive and his style crisp
yet interesting.
The chapters in the first part cover general aspects such as how
and why the 54 species are designed, non-breeding behaviour,
feeding ecology, breeding biology, and relationships and evolu-
tion. Some excellent tables summarise a number of interesting
aspects. Hornbilis, of course, are forest-dwelling birds, from
Africa, Asia and Indonesia - areas which now contain the most
damaged tropical evergreen forests in the world. In the chapter on
conservation, the author points out that huge areas of forest are
needed to support viable populations of the large species. An
estimated minimum of 2,000 km 2 in Malaysia may be required to
maintain a population of the Great Rhinoceros Hornbill, for exam-
ple. Few, if any, of the current forest reserves in Africa or Asia
seem capable, in isolation, of supporting a viable population of the
larger Hornbilis over the next century. A more manipulative
approach to their conservation is indicated. The provision of
artificial nest sites may become the most important method in moist
evergreen forests.
The author suggests that for two species endemic to small
islands, the Narcondam Wreathed and the Sumba Wreathed, cap-

tive breeding may be the only way to safeguard their extinction. On
Sumba much of their habitat has already gone, Hornbills are offered
for sale and even appear as items on the menu of local eating-
houses. He also suggests that captive breeding in the country of
origin would be useful in providing jobs and revenue for local
people and to raise the value of Hornbills. He then makes a remark
which I felt spoilt an otherwise superb book: "Exported birds might
even be neutered, to prevent competition from birds bred in captiv-
ity outside the range of the species." This is totally illogical. No-
one is going to breed the large Asiatic and Indonesian Hornbills in
such large numbers that there would be no demand for those reared
locally. Surely it is important to make an effort to breed from every
single bird in captivity? And taking into account the expense of
feeding and housing the large species, who would want to keep
pairs which could never breed?
The second part of the book (nearly 200 pages) is devoted to
species accounts. Each one contains a wealth of detail, such as
estimated laying dates in the wild in different regions. There is a
distribution map for each species. In the first part of the book
excellent drawings by Martin Woodcock illustrate various aspects
of behaviour. A section of colour plates in the centre depict every
species, with charm and accuracy. In addition, there are two pages
of plates depicting African Hornbills in flight.
The Hornbills (302 pages) is published by Oxford University
Press and costs #40, (ISBN 0 19 857729 X). This monograph is
required reading for anyone with an interest in these truly fascinat-
ing birds. It is the first title in the series Bird Families of the World.
The next two will be on the Megapodes and the Penguins.

At a meeting of Council on 3rd September 1995, the resignation
of the Society's Chairman, Professor J. R. Hodges was accepted
with considerable regret. Bob Hodges has been a member of the
Avicultural Society since 1947 and was elected to Council some 20
years ago. Since then he has edited the Society's magazine with
commitment and skill for some years. He was elected a Vice-
President in 1991.
His interest in aviculture has been lifelong and he has clear
recollections of acquiring his first Waxbills from Allen Silver's
shop in Newport (Gwent). Later, Grass Parrakeets were a great
interest and he has the distinction of having established the blue
mutation of the Splendid Grass Parrakeet in Britain in 1975.
He has travelled widely, meeting fellow aviculturists in various
countries around the world. His list of friends, some, sadly no
longer with us, reads like an avicultural Who's Who and his
recollections of them are invariably embellished either with inter-
esting anecdotes or recollections of species which they had bred or
with which they were closely associated.
Thus Alex Isenberg (California) is recalled for his successes
with the strikingly handsome Collie's Magpie-Jay and Rosita's
Bunting; Joseph Mattinson (Australia) is associated with breeding
the rare Golden-shouldered Parrakeet; while Walther Langberg
(Denmark) evokes memories of outstanding results with Parrot-
Finches.
Among many other avicultural luminaries he knew well are Jean
Delacour and Francis Rudkin. Alan Lendon is remembered with
obvious affection as \.. a great friend'.
He also recalls meeting some of the great collectors of the post-
war era including Cecil Webb and Wilfred Frost - and in particular
an occasion when the latter returned to England with a collection
of Birds of Paradise only to find there were no buyers for them!

'Belonging to the Avicultural Society has given me a great deal
of pleasure 5 , says Bob. 'And through the Society, to be able to
meet, over a near 50-year period, many of the most prominent
aviculturists and collectors in the world has been a wonderful
experience.
'Among the latter, although I never met Charles Cordier, at least
I had the pleasure of seeing a magnificent collection of birds he
brought from Costa Rica to the Bronx Zoo in New York and about
which Jean Delacour subsequently wrote in the Avicultural
Magazine \
Bob, who is as enthusiastic about bird watching as meeting
aviculturists, will combine the two interests in future oversees trips
including another visit to Australia in 1996.
His resignation as Chairman takes effect from 31st December
and he will be succeeded by another long-serving Council member,
Ken Lawrence. I am sure all members would wish to be associated
with the various expressions of thanks he has already received for
his unstinting efforts on behalf of the Society over many years.
By coincidence, my own resignation as Honorary Editor of the
Avicultural Magazine is effective following publication of this
issue. I step aside with considerable regret for I have made many
new friends over the past couple of years and have had a lot of help
from various people. But I have found it increasingly difficult to
deal as effectively as 1 would have liked with editorial matters since
I live and work in the north of England and the magazine is
produced in the west at Bristol.
As I write I am not aware who is to take over the editorial reins
but I certainly wish the person concerned all success in a role
which, although demanding, offers many a bonus.

A varied collection of exotic birds can be seen at Palmitos Park,
Gran Canaria, in the Canary islands. They include Birds of
Paradise, Hornbills, Peacock Pheasants, Crowned Pigeons, Hum-
mingbirds and, of course, many species of parrots. In fact, ten
parrot species, numbering at least 200 birds, live at complete
liberty. Brightly coloured parrots and toucans and little glittering
Hummingbirds receive many admiring glances, but there is also a
sombrely-coloured bird which most visitors pass without a second
glance - if, indeed, they see him at all. Many people, however,
spend several minutes in front of the adjoining aviary which
contains a Dumonti's Mynah Mino dumontii - because it talks.
They are missing one of the most intriguing birds in the park -
the Long-wattled Umbrellabird. It is a little-known member of the
Cotinga family - fruit eaters of the neotropics, most of which are
brightly coloured. What Umbrellabirds lack in vivid hues, is
compensated by the uniqueness of the male's appearance.
Taxonomists vary in their approach to Umbrellabirds, which are
considered either as three species, or one species with three forms.
The Ornate Cephalopterus ornatus has a wide distribution over
tropical northern parts of South America, the Bare-necked C.
glabricollls occurs on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica and in
western Panama, and the Long-wattled C. penduliger is from the
Andes of south-western Colombia and western Ecuador. There it
inhabits montane forests from about 700m up to 1,800m.
Male Umbrellabirds are about 18in (47cm) long with black
plumage and a crest which is perhaps more like a Beatle hair-cut of
the 1960s than an umbrella. The &quot;fringe&quot; reaches just above the
beak and just above the eyes. The tail is short. The female is about
15in (38cm) in length, brownish-black below with a smaller crest.
The male has what is described as a wattle or a lappet which hangs
from the neck over the breast. In the Bare-necked the wattle is short
and narrow but the throat and neck are bare. The vivid scarlet
colour is apparent when the air sac is inflated to give the appearance
of a red balloon. Then the male makes a booming sound. According
to Charles Cordier (in Ridgely, 1976), males chase each other with
chuckling sounds and a throaty oooah.

In the Long-wattled Umbrellabird, the wattle is one of the most
spectacular adornments of any bird species. It hangs from the upper
breast to just below the legs. However, when the air sacs are
inflated, the length increases so that there is an equal length below
the feet and above. Furthermore, the appearance of the wattle
changes dramatically; the feathers stand out at right angles and are
widely-spaced, instead of forming a sleek, narrow appendage. I can
only describe the expanded wattle as looking something like a
black hyacinth.

It is a male of the Long-wattled species which we keep at
Palmitos Park. His display is mesmerising! Fortunately, like Birds
of Paradise and other species which have a bizarre display to attract
females, he seems ready to perform to any admirer. He starts off
by bouncing on the perch with legs firmly anchored in one position,
and stretches to his full height. He bows his head, opening his crest

so that it looks something like a pom-pom. As he bows forward he
ruffles the feathers of the elongated wattle so that they separate. He
inflates his throat and starts to vroom. The resonant, low-pitched,
drawn-out vroom , vroom is far-carrying. The large inflated air sac
at the throat can be clearly seen on the downward bow. This
performance will be kept up for several minutes and is usually
carried out near the front of the aviary where he spends most of his
time. He can see the two mynahs next door and, because they are
black, I suspect that he might be displaying to them.
Displaying males in the wild are said to often perch lower than
the high trees they normally inhabit; nevertheless, observing them
must usually be difficult. Not surprisingly, little has been written
about these extraordinary birds. One of the earliest references is
that by Henry Bates, the famed British explorer, whose book The
Naturalist on the River Amazons was a best-seller of its time. His
adventures on the Amazon spanned the years 1848 to 1859. He
recorded the pleasure of seeing an Umbrellabird for the first time,
and described it thus: &quot;... a species which resembles in size, colour
and appearance our common crow, but is decorated with a crest of
long curved, hairy feathers having long bare quills which, when
raised, spread themselves out in the form of a fringed sunshade over
the head. A strange ornament, like a pelerine, is also suspended
from the neck, formed by a thick pad of glossy steel-blue feathers,
which grow on a long fleshy lobe or excrescence..." (Bates, 1863).
Bates must have seen the Ornate Umbrellabird which, he stated,
was confined to the forests of the plains of the upper Amazon. He
described it as a shy, retiring bird which lived in the highest
branches and fed mainly on fruit. Its nest was constructed of small
branches and placed in the top of a tall tree; the eggs were white and
numbered two. Considering how few naturalists could have seen
this species in this era, it is surprising how much was known about
it. Presumably, much of the information was gleaned from natives.
The native name for it, Uird mimbeu , referred to its voice. Un-
doubtedly they heard it more often than they saw it.
Bates was familiar with it though, and described the male in
flight, with the crest depressed and the wattle placed close to the
body. The female has only the rudiments of the crest and wattle.
About 70 years after Bates, the British collector Walter
Goodfellow, who took live birds to England for wealthy avicultur-
ists, lived for four years in Bolivia. He left there in the early 1920s.
During that period he had not been collecting birds for a living.
Nevertheless, he had always wanted an Umbrellabird. It is the

Ornate which occurs in that region. He let it be known that he was
seeking live specimens, as they were not rare in the area. On one
occasion, a man (who must surely have been impatiently observing
a nest) brought him a newly hatched chick. It was "covered in long
silky down, bright gold in colour and like floss silk." He told the
man to take it straight back to the nest.
On another occasion, when he called at a shack, he found "a
brown bird there undoubted belonging to the species" which had
been hand-reared. It was then that he discovered that he immature
plumage was brown. He only saw one other captive specimen - a
male with a broken wing kept as a pet on a farm. It fed on
cockroaches.
The people in the area were delighted if they could adorn their
hats with the crest of the Umbrellabird. Sadly, one man had nine
or ten in his hat.
While making that classic natural history film "The flight of the
Condor" in the 1970s, Michael Andrews encountered an Ornate
Umbrellabird at the Coca Falls in Peru. "There we were lucky to
get a shot - albeit in swirling mist - of an umbrella bird displaying
its extraordinary black crest like an extravagant plume on a helmet,
and inflating its huge dangling feather-covered wattle. This is
perhaps the first time that it had been filmed." (Andrews, 1982).
Umbrellabirds feed on fruits and large insects, perhaps also
small lizards. Walter Goodfellow stated that he had seen them
eating palm fruits, the size and shape of a large green date, which
was swallowed whole. As one tends to think of them as preferring
fleshy fruits, it would have been interesting to know if he made this
observation during the breeding season. Palm fruits have a very
high oil content but are usually very fibrous and, one would have
thought, difficult to digest.
Our male at Palmitos Park feeds mainly on finely chopped fruits,
including papaya, orange and pear, also seedless grapes. He
receives daily a small amount of minced beef heart.
Umbrellabirds have always been rare in zoological collections
and probably virtually non-existent in private collections. When
visiting San Diego Zoo in California in 1992,1 was delighted to see
a pair of Long-wattled there. In the past, Umbrellabirds were also
exhibited at Los Angeles Zoo. However, King (1981) states that it
is "avidly hunted for the cage-bird trade". This seems rather
unlikely. Colombia has not permitted the export of birds for 30
years or so and in view of the difficulty of even locating this
canopy-dwelling species, the number which have ever been cap-

tured alive must be rather small. Also, there is no demand for it.
King also states that it is large enough to be shot for food and
that it is one of the first species to disappear when new areas of
primary forest are opened up. It is apparently a naturally rare
species, even in suitable and remote habitat, a considerable amount
of which still survived a decade or more ago. It does occur in the
Archicaya valley in the Valle department of Colombia, where the
watershed is protected for the purpose of hydro-electric develop-
ment.
The Ornate Umbrellabird has a wide range but is not commonly
found in upland forests, preferring flooded forest and riverine
islands. One might have thought that this type of habitat would
afford it more protection but Goulding (1989) points out a partic-
ular threat. Since the advent of commercialized rubber collecting,
which has traditionally been concentrated on floodplains and riverine
islands, Umbrellabird populations have probably diminished as the
victims of hunting. They can be seen most easily when they cross
a river in search of fruiting trees. Goulding mentioned that Alfred
Russel Wallace, the great nineteenth-century naturalist, described
Umbrellabirds as "tolerably abundant" in the Central Amazon
region near Manaus. This is no longer the case.
In Central America, the Bare-necked species is uncommon and
local in its distribution, or rare. It breed in the wetter parts of the
cool subtropical belt of the Caribbean slope; out of the breeding
season, that is from about July to December, it migrates to the
foothills. There unfortunately, it, too, is threatened by deforesta-
tion.
Umbrellabirds are unique, intriguing and little-known inhabit-
ants of neotropical forests. A way must be found to preserve large
enough tracts of forest, especially in remote areas, to ensure their
survival and that of the multitude of other life forms which share
their environment.

By Joseph H. Lindholm, III
(Keeper II/Birds ? Fort Worth Zoological Park)
At the Conclusion to this autobiography, The Living Air, Jean
Delacour (1966) wrote: 64 It becomes difficult to face the future.
One has the uneasy feeling of being anachronistic. The end
lurks around the corner, and it must be met gracefully, but I
pray that it comes before my interest in life has been dulled, or
even suppressed by illness and infirmity. Until then I shall
delight in all that is beautiful, exciting or simply funny in the
world, and I am resigned to departing at any time, without
regret..." He was then 76.
'The summer of 1969 has been one of the best I can remember,
as far as the weather goes, in Western Europe. But it has not been
a good breeding season for birds. The spring was dull and cold and
the number of clear eggs high. Certain species even did not lay at
all...
'A large number of young birds ... however were reared at Cl ere s
... including Ringed Teal and another brood of five Black Brants.
But there were only six Emperor Geese, while none of Red-breasted
or Ross laid at all. By luck, the only hybrid produced was from a
male Black Brant and a female Lesser Whitefront (an almost
entirely black bird). A brood of Ruddy Ducks did not survive, the
six chicks having been carried away by the flow of the running
water. We now have two pairs of Trumpeter Swans, sent by the
United States Government.
'The Tasmanian Water Hens raised 18 young, six under a
bantam hen. All the others were reared in the park by two pairs...
'A number of new birds were acquired during the last season:
pairs of West African Ostriches, Two-wattled Cassowaries and
Wattled Cranes, ... Ijima Copper Pheasants (a gift from Mr. Ed.
Fitzsimmons), White-headed and Ross Touracous, also a number of
small tropical birds for the new accommodations which have been
built during the last summer; a modern bird gallery in what used to
be the drawing-room of the chateau (50ft. x 25ft.), destroyed by fire
in 1939 ...

birds in each of the smaller cages, while the four flights can
accommodate up to 70, They consist of Hummingbirds, Sunbirds,
Sugarbirds (including Dacnis lineata and an Iridophanes
puicherrima ), Mexican Golden-browed Tanagers Chiorophonia
cailophrys , all the species of American Painted Buntings Passerina,
Red-breasted Parrot Finches, a pair of small Red-headed Barbets
Eubucco bourcieri , a Cock of the Rock, a Blue and White Indian
Flycatcher and several Toucanets. The two larger aviaries contain
big Tanagers (Scarlet, Black-throated, Mountain, Red-rumped and
White-winged Blue), Blue and White Kingfishers, Pittas (Irena's
and large-billed), Bellbirds, Amethyst Starlings, Bulbuls and
Leafbirds, Rosita's Buntings, Black-headed Sugarbirds, Roulrouls,
Silver Chinese Quails, Sand Grouse and a few Waxbills. The two
smaller ones are the home of Calliste Tanagers (10 species),
Sugarbirds and Sun birds,
&apos;Larger aviaries in adjoining halls are inhabited by several
species of Toucans, including the Mountain Blue Andigena
laminirostris , Barbets, Troupials, Weavers, Whydahs and Star-
lings.
&apos;Some of those birds came from the collection of the late Mrs.
Milton Erlanger, as are five Knysna Touracous, all reared in her
aviaries at Elberon, New Jersey, during the past few years. They
were presented to me by her family and they constitute a living
memorial to a great bird-lover and a perfect friend ... .'
(The birds at Cleres in 1969. January-February, 1970 VoL

&apos;Once again I had the pleasure of visiting Brazil in November
1969, spending a couple of weeks with my friend Dr. E. P. Be rant
near Rio de Janeiro. His collection of tropical birds and plants ...
looks like a huge conservatory...
&apos;Although there are 25 aviaries, large and small, and more in the
making, none can be seen when you walk through the grounds. All
are built along the outer fences, sheltered by walls and hidden by
shrubbery...
&apos;Three of the flights are of large size and full of trees and plants.
They are close together, but irregular in shape. A corridor divides
two of them and gives access to a bird kitchen and to shelters where
caged birds and hand-fed fledglings are kept. Nine compartments
run along the back of the third aviary, and plans are made for
making another dozen of those breeding accommodations, where
pairs of birds are secluded. At present, they consist of several pairs
of Eclectus Parrots, most of them reared there, some Toucanets,

Motmots, Tacazze Sunbirds, Garnet-throated Hummingbirds, Blue
and Golden-breasted Sugarbirds, Fairy Bluebirds, the latter with
young. When pairs of birds are showing signs of nesting in the
larger aviaries, they are quickly removed to the privacy of these
breeding pens. The corridor is the home of a few pets - a Razorbill
Currassow, a Sun Bittern and a Purple-capped Lory.
'The three large flights contain remarkable species of soft-
billed Passerine birds, exotic as well as South American, of which
it no doubt is the best collection existing to-day.
'The first one is inhabited by a pair of Umbrella Birds
Cephalopterus penduliger , and three male and two female Guianan
Cock of the Rock Rupicola rupicola. They are all tame and agree
perfectly well. The male Cocks of the Rock display together. A
Lesser Bird of Paradise has been there for eight years and is in
superb plumage. A pair of Blue-winged Pittas and a Brazilian Ant-
Pitta Grallaria varia also live in peace as well as a few smaller
birds: Golden-winged Sunbirds, a Waterton's Wood-Nymph, and a
few small Formicariidae, including the lovely Pithys albifrons , ...
with a crested white face of the most unusual appearance. I have
seen long ago these curious birds following army ants in French
Guiana whence Charles Cordier brought some to Cleres later on.
'Another large flight is the home of Central American and
Golden-headed Quetzals, Scarlet Cocks of the Rock, a number of
Cotingas: a lovely and tame Swallow-tailed Phibalura flaviventria ,
a Bare-necked Fruitcrow Gymnoderus foetidus and a Black-necked
Tityra T. cayana\ a Swallow-winged Puffbird Chelidoptera
tenebrosa , various Tanagers, Scarlet-chested Sunbirds; several
small Hummingbirds Sericotesholosericeus,Augasteslumachellus ,
Stephanoxis lalandei : White-capped Redstarts Chimarrhornis ,
Royal, Splendid, Amethyst Starlings, American Jacanas (nesting),
different Plovers, etc.
'The largest aviary (about 35ft. x 25ft.), heavily planted, has a
little winding river where Cotton Teal can swim; there are also
Roul-Rouls and small Rails Laterallus leucopyrrhus; but is other-
wise dedicated to small species. There are Sunbirds N. pulchella ,
Hummingbirds of several sorts. Paradise Tanagers, different
Sugarbirds, Flowerpeckers Dicaeum, African Paradise Flycatch-
ers, a few Old World Robins, and Blue Cotingas. But most
remarkable is the collection of Manakins, which live there in

Antilophia galeata , a fairly large manakin from the interior of
Brazil (I found it common in Goias), black, with scarlet helmeted
head and back.
'There are other groups of aviaries. Two good-sized ones
contain pairs of African Pigmy Kingfishers, Irena's Pittas, Jamai-
can Long-tailed Hummingbirds, Blue-and-White Indian Flycatch-
ers and a few others. Five more are inhabited by Ross and White-
headed Touracous, Short-tailed Ant-thrushes Chamaza , Gnateaters
Conophaga , several species of small Rails, Roulrouls, etc. There
are pairs of Leadbeater's Cockatoos and Queen ofBavaria's Conures
in a large flight. The Conures were laying in a log, but it is
interesting to note that the Cockatoos, although in perfect condi-
tion, haver nested, probably due to the lack of a cold enough winter
and of too much humidity. Elsewhere live several Toucanets
Aulacorhynchus sulcatus , Pteroglossus beauharnaiesi, P.
bitorquatus , a number of Hummingbirds, Sunbirds, and various
small insect and fruit eaters.
'At the time of my visit, many nestlings collected very young in
Dr. Beraut's extensive land holdings at Tapirapuan, Mato Grosso,
were being hand-raised. The most interesting ones were 16 Trogons
of four species T. strigilatus, melanurus, curucui, collaris\ Cotingas,
Puff birds, Swallow Tanagers Tersina and 17 Jacamars Galbula
ruficauda. These were in broods of three or four. Very small when
I arrived, they grew up rapidly and were flying and perching within
10 or 12 days. Absurdly tame, they were fed every hour on small,
soft pellets composed of one-third ground beef heart, one-third
grated carrots, one-third maize cake (cooked). These highly insec-
tivorous birds are perfectly raised on that diet, which they continue
to eat when grown up. They live so well on it that they have
attempted to nest, digging in an artificial bank. But they are
quarrelsome birds, and the female injured the male. Adult-caught
Jacamars always refuse any food but live mealworms and never
lived long; Dr. Beraut hardly gives any to his Jacamars, mealworms
being scarce in Brazil. There was also an excellent young Squirrel
Cuckoo Piaya cayana and a Nightjar, fed the same way as were the
young Trogons.
'Because of various difficulties in procuring certain foods, all
birds in Dr. Beraut's aviaries receive that same meat-carrot-maize-
bread mixture, with diced cheese and for fruit, cut-up tomato and
papaya, and occasionally grapes; practically nothing else. They all
remain in perfect health as well as in excellent plumage and

&quot;It has long been my contention that the various birds considered
as members of the Sugar-bird family Coerebidae with the exception
of those of the genus Coereba , really are Tanagers Thraupidae
., My belief in their very close relationship as members of the same
family ... has just been highly supported by the recent production
of hybrids between two species ...
&quot;During 1971, several broods have been reared at San Diego Zoo
from a pair consisting of a male Yellow-winged Sugar-bird
Cyanerpes cyaneus and a female Mrs. Wilson&quot;s Tanager Tangara
nigrocincta fanny ...
&quot;The hybrids are intermediate and generally resemble Sugar-
birds of the genus Dacnis . The males are a light blue with a white
belly; the females resemble them but show much grey on the head
and neck.
&quot;It is interesting to note that there are many other Sugar-birds
and Tanagers in the large planted aviary, through which visitors
walk continually in the day. It is therefore not because of a lack of
more appropriate mates that those birds have paired up and bred

&quot;In these days of astonishing and disorderly proliferation of zoos
and bird parks throughout the world, it is a rare pleasure to discover
a really good one. But it is just what has happened to me and to my
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Jourde, when we stopped at the small
town of Villars-les-Dombes on the 5th June, 1971.
&quot;It is not that this new bird park was unknown to me. Three or
fours years ago, I received at Cleres a group of leaders of the
Department (County) de PAin, which is situated in the East of
France ...
&quot;... Dr. Ciarpaglini and I, also in Paris Prof. J. Nouvel, Director
of the zoos, and his assistants, tried to help them in all possible
ways in the planning of their park. A great deal of skill time and
money was spent on the project and the bird park was opened on
18th July 1970. But one never knows, and previous disillusions in
different countries, when I had seen for the first time the results of
well intended good advice, have made me suspicious. My wari-
ness, this time, proved quite unnecessary. The Parc Ornithologique

de la Dombes is a success, and no doubt one of the best of its kind
in the world.
&apos;It consists mainly of a long lake (Etang Grand Turlet) with
smaller ones at both ends. The landscape is typical of a marsh, with
comparatively few trees, mostly poplars and willows. Many others,
however have been planted and are growing well. All around the
lake is a walk, and at the sides, away from the lake, are groups of
aviaries and enclosures... Near the entrance is an excellent bird-
house...
Good breeding results were already achieved in 1970...
In addition... 25 local breeding birds were hand-reared:
Long-eared, Brown and Little Owls, Black Kite, Kestrel, Montagu&apos;s
Harrier, Purple Heron, Night Heron, Little Tern, Grey Wagtail and
Oriole.
4 ... On the north side of the lake, between the shore and two long
islands, some twenty pens have been built to house the pairs of
swans and geese which have to be isolated. Some Crested Grebes
are also to be seen here... 5

'Some twenty miles north of Paris, at 'le Clos du Cedres',
Mesnil-Aubry, Dr. Henry Quinque has gathered an unusual collec-
tion of rare birds, particularly Parrots and Parrakeets.
'The accommodation consists essentially of a basic block of 30
aviaries designed for Parrots. Each flight is 40ft. long, 4ft. wide
and 6ft. high and has a heated shelter. They are elaborately built
of steel and concrete, with all sorts of modern devices for the
welfare of the occupants. A long indoor corridor and an open air
one serve the aviaries at both ends.
'Other aviaries are found in different parts of the grounds,
inhabited by other Parrakeets and also by some rare passerine birds,
particularly Rothschild's Mynahs, Red Birds of Paradise and a few
others.
'The small park surrounding the house is walled-in and has a
large pond: Cranes, Flamingos and Waterfowl live there at semi-
liberty, as well as a few mammals. A pair of Kagus inhabit an
enclosure.
'The following species of Parrots and Parrakeets are represented
at present at Mesnil-Aubrey:
Great Palm Cockatoo : A pair, plus a tame male, over 40 years
old, which used to be U. Decoux's pet. Gang-gang Cockatoo :
Three pairs in perfect condition, which have not yet started breed-

Horned Parrakeet: A male of this very rare New Caledonian

which has produced hybrids with a female Red-fronted Kakariki ,
several pairs of which live and breed there. Rock Peplars : Regu-
larly breeding. Twenty-eight , Port Lincoln , Cloncurry and Brown&apos;s

Denton at Livermore... I saw there three males, one female and one
young of the extremely rare Bornean Peacock Pheasant, a very
scarce bird on that island, for fewer than a dozen specimens are
preserved in the great museums of the world. There are also hybrids
between it and the Malay, a close relative and only subspecifically
different. One of the four pairs of Bulwer's had laid, but the eggs
proved infertile; this seems to be the first clutch ever produced in

'I had the pleasure of paying a visit to Mr. Charles Sivelle at
Huntingdon Station, Long Island, early in march 1974. I had been
there a few years ago, and I was delighted to see how much his
collection of pheasants had increased and improved: it is probably
now the finest in the world ...
'We ... find several pairs of Koklass nipalensis and Blood
Pheasants Ithaginis cruentus (both species reared young last year)
as well as Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans. There are also two
pairs of White Eared Pheasants drouyni and an imported pair of pale
grey ones which I believe to be the rare Crossoptilon c. dolani.
Mikado and three forms of copper Pheasant - Ijima's, Soemmering's
and Scintillating are present and breeding ...
'More delicate species inhabit a long double row of pens
connected with adequate shelters in a large central house with
roomy heated compartments on each side of a central corridor. One
finds there a dozen pairs of Malay and Bornean Argus which
produce many young; different firebacks, including Lesser Bornean
and Malay Crestless, and four magnificent pairs of Bulwer's. The
latter have not yet started laying, but they are well acclimatised and
in excellent condition ... Mr. Sivelle has moreover been very
successful with Roulrouls, Tree Partridges A. torqueola and the
Bustard-quail Turnix sylvatica which breed freely ...'

'... The exceptional chilliness of the spring resulted in very poor
breeding results with many tropical species. Usually reliable
breeders such as touracous, various ground pigeons, Fairy blue-
birds and Superb Spreos failed to rear their broods. Splendid
Glossy Starlings, however, raised two young, the first born in
captivity to our knowledge. There were also four Kookaburras and
five Orange-headed Thrushes.
A pair of Bare-faced Curassows produced three chicks in
two broods, first two females, then a male. Sexes can be recognised
very early, as the females immediately grow heavily barred feath-
ers.

'There are two remarkably successful bird breeders in the
vicinity of the city of Phoenix and I have made a habit in recent
years of visiting their aviaries every winter when I am in the
western United States ...
Mr. B. Roer has a long record of successes with a variety of
birds ... He has reared in recent years, among many other species.
Crowned, Demoiselle and Stanley Cranes., and also various
curassows such as the Great, the Wattled and the blue-billed; he had
partial success with the Nocturnal, a rare species which so far has
only been completely reared at the Houston (Texas) Zoo ...
'Also in the vicinity of Phoenix Mr. L. M. Ollson, a younger
enthusiast, maintains one of the largest and finest collections of
tropical and subtropical birds to be found in the western world and
he is particularly successful with them. He has built numerous
aviaries and enclosures, all of generous proportions and well
planted ... They are strictly practical and no visitors are permitted
to enter the ground with the exception of other bird specialists.
'... Mr. Ollson has been especially lucky with his Double-
wattled Cassowaries C. casuarius for he has been able to keep three
together, one male and two females, in a roomy pen about 100ft. x
100ft. and planted with trees and bushes ... Mr. Ollson's birds,
which were raised together not only tolerate one another, but they
have bred during 1974, the two females laying fertile eggs and one
young one reared.
'... Argus, different peacock pheasants and others are doing
very well, but Mr. Ollson's most interesting achievement is his
outstanding success with curassows and other Cracidae. His
collection of these Central and South American birds is no doubt
the biggest in existence and he has reared more of them than anyone
else. Crestless Crax tomentosa. Salvin's C. salvini and Black C.

'... I have seen them wild at Cleres on only a few occasions.
Nests have been found several times in the hollows of old trees in
orchards. A brood of four was brought to us in 1947: they were
reared and eventually presented to Mr. Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren
Park where they bred. We kept and reared a few at Cleres a little
later on ... '

young, the largest brood from a trio, and we had a dozen Comb
Ducks from a group of one drake and six ducks ...
\.. Two pairs of Orange-headed Thrushes produced 15 young,
but only two were saved. They were heavily parasitised by some
kind of Roundworm, which, in other birds, are fairly easily control-

argus and peacock pheasants, Horsfield's and Edward's, the last

Swans which live and breed in a large colony: they are literally
resting in a thick bed of duckweed, which covers the waters. These
most useful and nourishing floating plants grow so fast that the

'The very large Disneyland, also in the area includes a vast
freshwater lake with, in the middle of it, a &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, most
cleverly landscaped and planted, which is a dream of a tropical
jungle. There are several big, well camouflaged flights, with
macaws and other parrots, birds of prey, waterfowl, game birds and,
particularly, a huge one which visitors enter and cross on a long
rustic, winding bridge; Scarlet and Sacred Ibises, Argus, Palawan

sandy beach and board a boat to leave that enchanted island.'

'Once again freak weather played havoc with the birds in 1976:
we had a very hard frost at the end of May, when many waterfowl
were ready to nest, and it just stopped them. Many species simply
did not lay, not even usually reliable breeders such as Black Brant
and Ross's Geese; we had no eggs from Red-breasted and very few
young from Emperor, Greenland White-fronted, Bar-headed and
Swan Geese. Unfortunately hybrids cropped up in the broods,
Emperor x Bar-headed, Barnacle x Emperor, Barnacle x Bar-
headed and Black Brant x Cackling. It is inadvisable to rear
together chicks of different species, as they may become imprinted
to each other and pair badly.
'Sarus, Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes never nested at all, but
a pair of Wattled Cranes laid seven eggs, all of them infertile. A
fair number of ducks were reared, none particularly rare. Among
the young pheasants were seven Edwards', four being females. Our
collection has been much improved thanks to the generosity of Mr.
C. Sivelle, Mr. K. Howman and Major I. Grahame, who sent us pairs
of Bornean and Malay Firebacks, Ijima Copper, Cheer and other
pheasants; also Germain's Peacock Pheasants. We also acquired
Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants, a species recorded breeding in
captivity for the first time before the war.
'A number of doves were reared, particularly Mountain Witch
and Bleeding-heart. It was a good year for touracous and we raised
four Senegal, three Knysna and one White-cheeked; the latter was
produced by a pair living at Cleres for more than 20 years. They
had never nested successfully before and they are of such a murder-

a separate aviary, as they attack even large pheasants.
'The flamingos settled down to breed on the southern bank of the
lake in May, building their own nests without any help, the Carib-
bean seven, Greater one and Chilean five, a little farther away ...
They all incubated their eggs normally, but only one (Caribbean)
hatched and was reared without any special care.'
(Notes on Cleres - 1976. October - December 1976. Vol.

This, in its entirely, was the last report from Cleres written by
Dr. Delacour, 56 years after the first.
'I had long been aware of the existence of two great collections,
particularly of game birds, in Mexico .., but I had not had a chance
to visit them until last November, when I found them absolutely
remarkable, and though they have been mentioned before in Amer-
ican magazines, particularly by Mr. C. Sivelle ..., I feel that my
experience should be recorded in the Avicultural Magazine where
I have for so many years described bird collections in the various
parts of the world.
Senor Jose G. Zunco Arce, a graduate economist, owns and
manages an extensive estate at Tuxpan which includes a vast cattle
ranch and a large bee farm, besides his collection of living wild
birds...
'There are some 200 aviaries elaborately and elegantly built of
steel and slender concrete supports on solid vermin-proof founda-
tions, with brick walls and tiled-roof shelters at the back. They are
good sized, a number very large and high, containing tall avocado
and other trees ... Gamebirds form the most important part of the
collection, but there are many other birds... Roomy aviaries are
inhabited by crowned pigeons of three species. Nutmeg and other
pigeons and doves, parrots, toucans, quetzals and trogons show
themselves here and there ... A few hummingbirds are kept in cages
and a tame pair live free in the dining-room - an exquisite sight. All
species of pheasant available at present are kept and reared in
numbers: I particularly noticed Argus, peacock pheasants, firebacks,
very tame Bulwer's Pheasants and Ocellated Turkeys. There are
also Roulroul and Bhutan Wood Partridges Arborophila torqueola
and the very rare tree partridges Dendrortyx of southern Mexico
and Central America, one species, D. macroura , breeding.
'Curassows, guans and chachalacas, however, form perhaps the
most interesting part of the collection ... All species of Curassow

Chamaepetes goudoti and C. unicolor , the Wattled Aburria aburri
and the Highland Guan Penelopides nigra. The last named ... has
been breeding well at Tuxpan during the past three years, and I was
able to observe immature males with a barred brown juvenile
plumage - a peculiar case in the family where otherwise no distinc-
tive juvenile plumage exists, the chicks assuming immediately the
adult plumage.
'Perhaps the most sensational birds in the collection are three
huge, strange and beautiful Horned Guans Oreophasis derbianus
from the high volcanos of Southern Mexico and Guatemala, a
striking and very rare species. As big as curassows, thick-set but
with shorter legs, their black and pearl-grey colours, red horn,
white eyes and curious bill give them an extraordinary aspect.
These three fine birds, tame and in perfect condition, have been
hand-reared from wild collected eggs. They are thought to be two
males and one female, but the sexes are alike in appearance.
'Most species are represented by several pairs and are breeding,
the greatest success having been achieved with the Venezuelan
Helmeted Crax p. pauxi, of which a good number have been reared
during the past few years. Senor Zuno possesses one of the very
rare buff-barred females, an unusual colour phase, but she has so far
produced only black young...
'Dr. R. J. Estudillo Lopez is the other outstanding Mexican
aviculturist. A trained zoologist and a veterinarian, particularly an
expert on poultry diseases, he teaches at the University of Mexico,
but he also manages an enormous poultry farm and a laboratory,
supplying most of the vaccines used in the Mexican poultry indus-
try. Dr. Estudillo lives in the neighbourhood of the capital city at
an altitude of 2,200m. where the weather is never too hot, nor in
winter cold enough to injure tropical birds. His 120 aviaries are
very well and carefully built... They are disposed in several rows
facing one another and separated by large pens for pinioned and
non-flying birds such as cranes, rheas and cassowaries (Bennett's).
Farther away is a large enclosure with ponds, the home of flamin-
gos, swans and other waterfowl, bustards, Andean Giant Coots,

of Bulwer's Wattled Pheasants, a species reared there for the first
time in captivity in 1974, the parents having been brought from
Borneo by Dr. Estudillo himself. All the tragopans, firebacks and
other species of pheasant now available are well represented and
breed regularly, as do Green Peafowl and Ocellated Turkeys.
Curassows and guans are, of course, a special feature of the
collection, all the curassows being represented except for the
Southern Helmeted Crax unicornis of which the Antwerp Zoo
possesses a pair sent by Charles Cordier from Bolivia and the very
rare C. blumenbachi from south-eastern Brazil that is on the verge
of extinction, but was found again by Dr. A. Ruschi in the State of
Espirito Santo. I had recently the opportunity of observing a live
pair in the Sao Paulo Zoo, for the first time..
'Most species of curassow have bred in Dr. Estudillos' aviaries
the Great rubra since 1965, Wattled 1966, Blue-billed 1971, Razor-
billed 1972, Crestless tomentosa , Yellow-knobbed daubentoni ,
Venezuelan and Colombian helmeted p. pauxi and p. gilliardi ,
Nocturnal Nothocrax urumutum all since 1974. There is in the
collection a very puzzling male collected in Bolivia. It resembles
in the general shape of the bill and crest the Great Curassow, but it
is a little smaller, has white tips to the tail feathers and its bill knob
is pale greenish-blue, quite unlike other species in colour. It no
doubt represents a still unknown form.
'Guans and chachalacas are very numerous: Aburria aburri has
been breeding there since 1974 and Chamaepetes goudoti since
1972, both for the first time in captivity. Among the more unusual
species, I noticed a Pipile cumanensis , Penelope montagnii, P.
supercilliaris, P. obscura , P. perspicax and P. pileata. There are
two different subspecies of P. jacaquacw, one, from Bolivia, is
larger, brighter in colour and a bluer facial skin; its windpipe is not
elongated as in the typical form, and it probably belongs to another
yet unknown form'.

Dr. Delacour made no contribution to the AviculturalMagazine
in 1978, the first year, since he began writing for it in 1916, that
he had failed to do so.
'It is about a hundred and fifty years ago that pheasants of many
species began being imported, reared and established in Europe. In
those days, parks, extensive shooting preserves and game farms
were numerous. Their owners were trying to introduce new game
birds and most of them maintained pheasantries to exhibit the most

beautiful species, which constituted fine additions to their gardens.
Zoological societies, particularly in Paris, London and Antwerp,
were organised and they built their zoos; one of their main activ-
ities was to import, acclimatise and propagate suitable mammals
and birds which could be distributed later to their members...
'When I started collecting pheasants in 1905, many species were
still extensively bred. Fine pheasantries were not rare... In fact it
was then easy to acquire, each summer, specimens of all the species
kept in captivity...
'Pheasant keeping started developing in America at the same
time. Until then, only the New York (Bronx) Zoo and a very few
others, and privately, Colonel A. Kuser in New Jersey had good
collections ...
'Pheasant studies and collections had reached a peak in 1939,
but the war destroyed the European stocks to a great extent. A few
rare species, particularly Blyth's Tragopans and Crested Argus
disappeared and have so far never been replaced.
'There still were, however, a number of birds left in America
and even in England. Soon after 1946 others came from their
native countries and pheasant collections prospered again. They
have now reached a very high standard and I feel happy to witness
the accomplishments of many friends, particularly in America.
Changes in physical and social conditions have necessitated new
techniques and ways to rear birds, and they prove to be adequate.
'The propagation of game birds is the more important at present
since most species are threatened with extinction in their native
lands by the destruction of the forests, their indispensable habitat,
nor to speak of the increasing interference of man.'
(Introduction to the Pheasant Issue. October - December, 1997.

'It never occurred to me that I would have, one day, to write the
obituary of Phyllis Barclay-Smith.
'Not only was she considerably younger than I am, but I had
found her in a good state of health during a long visit she paid to
Cleres in August 1979. When she left to return to England, I did not
suspect that it was the last time I would see her...
'We had been close friends and associates for a long time. When
I first met her, she was a young assistant to her uncle and aunt, Mr.
and Mrs. F. Lemon, who in those days managed the affairs of the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds as Secretary. She held
that position between 1929 and 1935.

'Soon after the organisation of the International Council for
Bird Preservation (1922), of which I am the only founder still alive,
I started as its Vice-President for Europe, working with the RSPB,
and I came into contact with Miss Barclay-Smith. Here, unusual
efficiency was already obvious. Her association with all the
ornithologists interested in preserving birds all over the world
developed gradually, and in 1935 she became an Assistant Secre-
tary of the ICBP. She soon took over a number of the various
responsibilities of the Council, and between 1938 and 1958, while
I was its President, she actually managed our activities all over the
world, carrying on under my successor, Professor Dillon Ripley,
until 1978 when she relinquished her position of Secretary to
become a Vice-President.
'All that pertains to birds was Miss Barclay-Smith's greatest
interest, not only their conservation in a hostile and ever more
threatening world, but their study in nature and their observation
and propagation in captivity. She dedicated herself to those various
pursuits with an energy and a relentlessness that were a guarantee
of success. She became the Honorary Secretary of the British
Ornithologists' Union (1945 - 1951) and later on a Vice-President.
'She certainly was an aviculturist in a special restricted way.
Living in London, she could only keep a few caged pets, which she
did with unusual skill and devotion. Her old friends will remember,
in particular, a pair of Yellow-winged Sugar Birds which she
possessed for a very long time. No birds have ever been kept with
more sentimental and elaborate care.
'The Avicultural Society, just before the Second World War,
was in a difficult situation. We had to find a new editor for the
Magazine. The late David Seth-Smith, who had been, on and off,
its editor for over thirty years, finally had to retire. There was no
suitable replacement in sight and our President, the late Alfred
Ezra, and I endeavoured to persuade Miss Barclay-Smith to accept
the position. She was reluctant to assume a responsibility, but we
promised her all the possible help and she finally agreed to try. She
edited the Avicultural Magazine for the next thirty-five years (1938
- 1973).
'... Now that hard work appears to have become an oddity, it is
difficult to imagine that anyone achieved so much, for so many
years. In the course of her incessant activities, she had met all the
prominent ornithologists of the world, and many became close
friends...

'Miss Barclay-Smith's singular achievements were widely rec-
ognised. She was made a member of the British Empire in 1958,
and a Commander in 1971. She was awarded the gold medal of the
RSPB and the Medal of the ICBP, as well as a number of foreign
orders and awards.
'... To-day, when not only birds, but nature itself, are threatened
with destruction by man's senseless over-exploitation and consec-
utive pollution, she will be missed to an extent still difficult to
evaluate.'
(Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, CBE. January - March, 1980.
Vol. LXXXVI, 46 - 48.)
1981 was the only other year during his association with ;this
magazine that Dr. Delacour did not write for it.
'It has been a great shock to Len HilTs many friends all over the
world to hear that he died suddenly on his return journey from the
Falkland Islands that he visited every year. He was not quite 70
years old and appeared to be as fit and active as ever when he left
England six weeks previously but he fell asleep on the plane and did
not wake up.
'Len Hill was an unusually bright character. He came from
humble origins and started working life as a boot boy, living with
his parents in the stableyard of the very place that he later acquired,
Chardwar Manor at Bourton-on-the-Water. In his youth he became
a successful builder and then, because he loved birds, he gathered
together one of the best collections in the world in the four acres of
gardens at the back of his lovely old manor, the famous &quot;Birdland&quot;.
He had, without doubt, a very special gift for planning aviaries and
enclosures, as well as a great deal of taste, and no space was wasted.
'Now at Birdland there are beautiful greenhouses full of well
arranged tropical plants and suitable birds, very pretty outdoor
aviaries, lawns, ponds and penguin accommodation...
'There are also excellent educational and public facilities. I
remember opening a lecture hall there a number of years ago which
was adorned with a beautiful mural by Peter Scott. There was a
great reception on that occasion, attended by many of our old
members who have since left us. Len Hill was a marvellous host
and a very generous man. In the course of the years, he gave many
delightful parties for our members - we paid for the reception but
the money collected went to our treasury. He was, in fact one of
our very best supporters and gave equally generously of his time by
entertaining the members at social meetings when he showed films
of his birds.

'Len Hill had a flair for special undertakings, the most unusual
being the acquisition of two uninhabited islands of the Falklands
group. Grand Jason and Steeple Jason. Birds, particularly pen-
guins, are abundant there and he scrupulously preserved them
taking only, now and then, a few specimens for his Birdland. He
could also write well about this and his other bird activities.
'In these difficult days for private initiative that the world is
going through, Len Hill stood out as an exceptional example of free
enterprise. The members of our Society, and indeed all those in the
world who share our interest in birds, will feel the poorer for his
sudden and unexpected departure.'
(Len Hill - An Appreciation. January - March, 1982. Vol.
LXXXVIII, 56 - 57.)
This concludes Dr. Delacour's 281st and final contribution to
the Avicultural Magazine, written when he was 91. Thereafter,
arthritis prevented him from further writing. Physical impair-
ments, however, did not interfere with his command of ornithol-
ogy and aviculture, as was quite evident to all who knew him in
his final years. To the end he took a vigorous interest in the
latest developments and enthusiastically expressed his opinions
of them... I will close with what he told me in 1985, the year he
died, about the Glaucus Macaw Anodorhynchus glaucus that he
saw on childhood visits to the Jardin D'Acclimatation in the
Bois de Boulogne: "It was quite ugly! - Too large a head, too
short a tail, an unattractive colour - Not pretty at all. But... it
was the only one I ever saw."

FIRST CAPTIVE BREEDING OF THE GUAIABERO
PARROT

The Guaiabero Parrot Bolbopsittacus lunulatus , is a little know
species which has only been maintained within aviculture on a few
occasions outside its endemic range of the Philippine islands.
Those few birds that have been seen in aviculture did not adjust
well to captivity and no breeding of this species has previously been
recorded. The Research and Breeding Centre operated by Birds
International in the Philippines has maintained a number of
Guaiabero in captivity for an extended period of time and managed
to achieve the first world breeding of the species in 1993. A
complete husbandry report is currently in preparation from several
joint authors, but given here are my preliminary notes from work-
ing with, and breeding, the species.
The Guaiabero measures around 15 cm in length. In appearance
it is a short stocky bird with a broad head, a short broad bill, and
with short rounded wings and tail. In adult birds sexual dimorphism
is clearly apparent. The male has mainly green plumage, which
becomes more yellowish on the underparts of the body. The
forehead, lores, periopthalmic region, throat and lower cheeks are
blue; a blue collar encircles the neck and meets the blue cheeks.
Blue is also present upon the bends of the wings. The rump area and
upper tail coverts have a yellowish tinge to their green colouration.
The upper wing coverts are also of a yellowish green shade. Pale
yellow runs across the underside of the secondaries. The bill is
grey, becoming black towards the tip; the legs are grey.
The female differs from the male by having blue only upon the
throat and lower cheeks, by having a yellow collar on the hindneck
(with some fine black markings) and by having similar markings on
the yellowish green rump feathers. Notes on the appearance of
development of the Guaiabero chick follow later in this article.
Fledged immature birds resemble the hen except for the lighter
colouration of the bill. In the description given by Joseph M.
Forshaw (1989, Parrots of the World , Cassell P.L.C.), four subspe-
cies are described. The nominate is listed as occurring from Luzon
and has already been described.
B. /. intermedins is listed as occurring from the island of Leyte.
The male is described as differing from the nominate by his

underparts being a darker green; the blue on the face being darker
with a purple tinge; and by having a brighter blue collar. The
female is described as differing from the nominate by the blue
colouration restricted to the throat; by having pale green cheeks;
having a paler shade of green around the eye; having a more orange
collar and by lacking the yellowish tinge to the green rump and
thigh colouration.
B. /. callainipictus is listed as occurring from the island of
Samar. The male is described as being similar to B. 1. intermedius,
but with the general plumage being more yellowish, particularly on
the underparts; the blue on the face being darker and more greenish
and having less blue on the cheeks. The female is described as
again being similar to B . /. intermedius , but having a brighter
yellow nuchal collar and rump.
B. 1. mindanensis is listed as occurring from Mindanao and
Panaon. The male is described as differing from the nominate
description by having green cheeks separating the blue periopthalmic
region from the blue throat; the blue hindneck collar being a
brighter and darker blue; the head has a yellowish tinge contrasting
with the purer green of the back. The female is not noted as
differing from the nominate description.
To date, the Guaiabero that I have worked with in captivity have
all been of the nominate subspecies which occurs from Luzon,
except for a single female specimen of B. 1. callainipictus which
came from the island of Samar. In the case of this single female
bird, the plumage colouration did not appear to differ significantly
from female birds of the nominate subspecies. A brief examination
of available skins of the different subspecies in the collection of the
Philippine National Museum proved inconclusive as in many spec-
imens the plumage colouration was to some degree faded and the
subtle differences in colouration will have to be accurately as-
sessed by comparison with live specimens rather than preserved
skins.
In behaviour the Guaiabero is a shy, quiet bird which, when
compared with other Psittacines, is to me most reminiscent of the
Blue-rumped Parrot Psittinus cyanurus. Guaiabero generally move
slowly and carefully. As they move around by climbing along the
perching, they rarely seem to fly within their cage unless something
startles them. For much of the time they seem to take little notice
of their respective mates and do not seem to exhibit close pair-
bonding, even in the case of the pair which has now successfully
bred.

The husbandry of the Guaiabero is very similar to that I use for
Opopsitta species, although the Guaiabero requires even more
seclusion and privacy in the accommodation provided. While the
accommodation for this species needs to be secluded, it is also
essential that discreet regular observation can be carried out by the
keeper. This is also a bird that does not like to descend from the
level of the aviary perching and is rarely, if ever, seen voluntarily
at ground level. Because of this a new design was used in 1993
which allowed for food, water, perching and the nest site to be
located all at the same high level within the cage. This is thought
to be one of the main reasons why breeding success was achieved
for the first time in 1993. The diet of the Guaiabero at the Research
and Breeding Centre consists of four small feeds given each day.
The first and third feeds consist of various chopped fruits and
vegetables including papaya, plantain banana, steamed sweet pota-
to, steamed carrots and chico. The second and fourth feed each day
consist of millet seeds, a dry powdered food made from various
baby cereal foods, rice cereals, banana and either guava or chico.
A commercial brand of multi-vitamins and mineral powder is
sprinkled over the food at each feeding period.
From the notes I made of several parent-incubated eggs moni-
tored during the 1993 breeding season, it appears that the incuba-
tion period for this species is 22 days. Artificial incubation has not
so far been attempted. The eggs are white in colouration and can
be considered as of normal appearance and shape for Psittacines.
Clutches I have observed so far have consisted of either three or
four eggs. In the case of the chicks hatched during 1993, in all cases
they were incubated and hatched by their parents before being
removed and taken to the nursery department for hand-rearing soon
afterwards. I made the following notes on one of the chicks reared
from the first clutch of eggs.
On being removed from the nest box it was estimated that he
chick had hatched around 12 to 15 hours earlier; its weight upon
arrival at the nursery was recorded as 8 grams. When newly
hatched the skin coloration is light pink, the chick does not have
any natal down covering the skin. At this early age the chick is very
unstable in its body stance, although it did seem to be quite active.
Day 5 - The chick is now much stronger and can easily maintain
an upright body stance. The eyes are just beginning to slit. The toe
nails are turning light grey and the bill is white. The upper
mandible has a noticeably slender shape.
Day 13 - Both eyes are fully open. The toe nails are now black

and the feet are grey in colour. The first signs of developing pin
feathers can be seen forming underneath the skin.
Day 18 - The first pin feathers are just starting to emerge
through the skin, those of the flight feathers.
Day 20 - Tail pin feathers are just starting to emerge through the
skin, pin feathers are nearly ready to appear over the head.
Day 23 - Flight pin feathers now measure more than 1 cm. Pin
feathers are now also emerging through the skin on the thighs,
breast and mantle. The tail pin feathers are now well developed.
Day 27 - Much of the head and lower body is now covered by
short pin feathers, with the flight pin feathers measuring more than
2 cm. The bill is becoming darker in colour.
Day 32 - Pin feathers are now covering most of the body, except
the flank regions. Some flight pins are now just starting to split
through their quilling.
Day 35 - The bill is now greyish-brown in colour. The pins
covering the head and body are becoming larger and showing more
of the feathers colouration through the quilling.
Day 39 - The feathers of the upper wing coverts have broken
through their quilling and the flight pins are continuing to split
through their quilling at the tips of each feather.
Day 41 - Most ofthe upper wings are now feathered, there is still
some quilling covering the base of the flight feathers. The breast
is also feathering with most feathers having broken through their
quilling.
Day 44 - The breast, abdomen and sides of the head are now well
feathered. Tail feathers are starting to split through the quilling to
appear.
Day 48 - The wings, upper back, breast and abdomen are all now
feathered, the head is continuing to become more extensively
feathered. The feet are grey with black toe nails, the bill is light
grey in colouration.
Day 51 - The only areas which are not yet fully feathered are the
crown, forehead, ear coverts and the flank regions.
Day 65 - The chick is now fully feathered. Weaning began
around day 70 and was completed by day 870. After weaning the
weight of the chick stabilised at between 65 - 70 grams.
The Guaiabero remains one of the most difficult members of the
Psittidae family to maintain and breed in captivity, but having now
achieved successful reproduction for the first time during 1993 it
is hoped that more consistent success will follow. A more detailed

THE OBI LORY
By Dulcie Cooke

<bodyText confidence="0.996585297297297" page_id="56270651"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
The Obi Lory, Eos squamata obiensis is deservedly one of the
most popular of all the small to medium sized lories. These very
beautiful birds are now becoming well established in the U.K. and
on the continent of Europe. As seems to be the case with so many
species there is at present a shortage of females. This will probably
alter as they become even more domesticated.
Their original homes were the Obi Islands to the west of Irian
Jaya, Indonesia, these with the larger island of Halmahera and
others form part of the group of islands known as the Moluccas. It
is this group which is home to the extremely rare 'blue' Halmahera
King Parrot, Alisterus amboinensis hypophonius.
The clearly defined colours of Obi Lories, crimson-scarlet head
and breast, deep purple lower breast, purple leg feathers, black
shoulder (scapular) feathers and black and scarlet wings make these
birds stand out as a species of exceptional beauty. A bright orange
beak, brown eyes and grey legs with a pretty brown and soft red tail
complete the picture. Their intelligence, affectionate nature and
playful ways ensure that those who see them usually wish to acquire
pairs or even single birds as they become available.
Some small to medium sized lories (they weigh about VA - 4 oz.)
make a lot of noise, which can be very trying in a built-up area; Obi
Lories will call when they want to attract attention or when they are
hungry, but this call does not carry more than a few metres and the
birds are not chatterers in the way which applies to many birds,
including some lories. Most of the day Obies remain quiet, amusing
themselves happily with whatever is available to them in the form
of small branches, dry wood shavings in which to play and roll etc.
Watching them at play one is always reminded of two small puppies
playing together.
During the first year of their lives Obies viewed from the front
look almost like small red and purple partridges with heavily
serrated breast colours. These markings are lost over a period of 6
to 12 months so that by the time they reach 18 months or two years
of age their beautiful clearly defined red and purple markings will
be visible on the breast and the thin serrated scarlet stripe on the
wings will state very clearly that these birds are Obies; so also will
their black scapular feathers.

COOKE- THE OBI LORY

Some writers describe their colours (which do vary slightly) as
containing some 'grey' round the neck. I can only think that the
writers concerned were perhaps looking as museum specimens
whose colours had faded considerably. In the years that my late
husband I have kept and bred Obies we, and now I, must have seen
dozens of them, many of which have been bred at my home. Never
ever has a specimen appeared with any grey markings. Many of
them have deep purple markings almost like a half necklace, others
may have perhaps one purple patch the size of a thumbnail some-
where near the neck.
Obi lories normally reach breeding age in their third year, but
I believe that as they become more domesticated they will start to
breed at an earlier age. These birds have bred to the second
generation here, and now some of those birds are breeding in
Holland, making a third generation bred in aviaries. This year a two
year old pair of mine appear to be making a serious effort to hatch
and rear chicks. This hen laid for the first time at one year of age,
the eggs were not fertile. The cock was also one year old. At
eighteen months of age she laid again and the pair of them tossed
the eggs about and broke them, but now she sits closely and the cock
feeds her on the nest at frequent intervals.
Although Obi Lories will enjoy a large house and flight and
make the fullest possible use of such accommodation it is not
necessary. One pair of mine seems extremely happy in a flight two
metres by one and a third metres by two metres high, with a house
one metre by one and a half metres by two metres high.
The roof of the house has an inner plywood ceiling and interlin-
ing with household insulation 10 cm thick. It is a great help to the
birds in the winter months if the walls of the house are also
interlined with some smooth washable material such as formica.
The roof of the flight is covered with corrugated PVC and the sides
are double wired with 'spacers' to keep the wires apart. It is only
really necessary to have one lot of wire on the roof if it is to be
covered. These birds tend to play a lot on the wire and with these
precautions they are protected from cats, foxes, hawks, magpies
and squirrels. A wire 19 gauge 1cm x 0.5 cm is recommended.
The floor of the house is made of cement 10 cm thick and in
winter is lined with about 10cm of wood shavings. The floors of my
flight are of ornamental stones laid on a base of sand or soil with
just enough space between each stone to allow of drainage but not
to allow even the smallest mouse through. If the flight is in an
exposed position it would be advisable to enclose it in the winter

with PVC sheeting, A 'night light 5 to allow the birds to eat early
and late is a great help to them.
Once over the first year Obies are quite hardy if the above
measures are taken, but during the first winter young birds should
be given every possible protection. If there is electricity in the
house it is easy to replace the c low-night light 5 with a heat lamp
during very cold weather, or even a 100 watt bulb will give some
warmth.
Unlike members of the Chamosyna family of lories and lorikeets
who quickly learn to use their nest boxes, especially in cold weather
,some Obi cocks will stubbornly refuse to enter a nest box until they
are at least two years of age and sometime the hen will not enter
until the cock has investigated. However it is as well to hang the
box in the house right from the time a young pair is given a home
of their own so that they have plenty of time to get used to its
presence.
A nest box 20cm square by two thirds of a metre high is suitable
for Obies, with an entrance hole 6cm in diameter - an internal
ladder and perch inside and outside below the entrance hole are
essential. Since the box is best hung in the house it need not be very
thick. Two centimetres is enough. An inspection door is neces-
sary. About 12cm of woodshavings makes good nesting material,
which should be inspected frequently especially in winter. Any
damp material needs to be replaced with dry shavings.
Babies from the age of two to three days need to have their
nesting material or part of it, replaced daily with clean dry and
warm shavings. During this operation the babies can be put in a
small tissue lined box and replaced very carefully in the middle of
the box on the warm shavings.
As with other Lories two eggs are laid. They take about 24 - 26
days to hatch and the chicks will leave the nest at about 8-10 weeks
of age. They will live quite happily with the parents for some time,
unless the parents are either going back to nest, or feather pluckers.
In both cases as soon as it is seen that the babies can feed themselves
they should be removed to another aviary.
Obies present no problems with food, although I prefer to use my
own nectar mixture which I feed twice per day, three times per day
when the parents are feeding young; there are many excellent
commercial nectar mixtures available. I also use my own dry food
which is fed once per day, fresh, and placed next to a water
container, I never seed of any kind, but do give the birds a small
piece of washed green lettuce daily and sweet apple. Lories and

lorikeets love the pollen and nectar from fresh flowers, the pleasure
on their faces when they have a few flowers wired on to a perch is
a sight not easily forgotten. Many garden and wild flowers are
extremely poisonous, it should be noted that all parts of the
rhododendron, including the flowers, are poisonous.
The following flowers are quite safe to give to lories and
lorikeets: pansies, wallflowers, fuchsias, roses, wild honeysuckle,
small single begonias and Impatiens (busy Lizzies). Small branch-
es of willow, any kind, sweet apple and hazel nut are extremely
good for the birds and give them great pleasure to demolish. I am
told there is a chemical, Biotin, under the bark of trees which helps
to prevent rickets, perhaps the birds sense the value of the bark to
themselves and to their young.
Obies bred in aviaries are often delightfully tame and affection-
ate, and most fascinating to watch with their constant playfulness;
some even learn to say a few words.

Opened in 1970 , the Cotswold Wildlife Park - like many similar
establishments - provided a more naturalised habitat and, in some
cases, more space for its animals. Among the first occupants of the
park's walled garden area was a group of Humboldt Penguins
Spheniscus humboldti. At the time they were acquired little
detailed information was available about these birds, or indeed of
any of the other penguin species.
A particular problem was accurate sexing, not only of Penguins
but of many other species which were not sexually dimorphic. This
was one of the factors which meant there was no successful and
continuous breeding of penguins until 1976/7. and despite initial
teething problems the following 10 years were very successful
indeed and added greatly to our knowledge of these birds.
However, in 1989 we began to experience worrying, and even-
tually serious problems with the park's group. Over the previous
three/four years reduced fertility and hatch-rate were the main
symptoms, but suddenly we began losing adult birds.
From that point our main concern was that pathological exam-
ination failed to identify obvious problems. By the end of 1990 our
colony of Humboldt Penguins had been decimated. Only one bird,
bred at the park the previous year, remained.
Our dilemma at this stage was in not knowing what had caused
the deaths and thus what practical steps we could take to prevent a
recurrence should we introduce new birds to the area. Among
precautionary measures taken we changed fish suppliers, added a
new water filter system and modified some of our water manage-
ment techniques.
Having made these adjustments we brought in a new group of
penguins which were readily accepted by our lone survivor.
At this point I should emphasise that the park's problem with
these birds was by no means unique. In fact at least six other UK
collections were experiencing similar difficulties at the time.
Our new group was made up of birds which had survived in other
collections and they settled very quickly. One old pair, which had
previously bred successfully, reared two chicks. We thought our
problems were behind us, but a year later there was a further

recurrence and this time ail the birds died.
We had not simply been sitting back over the period. Water and
fish samples had been tested and pathologists - some located as far
away as the United States - had looked at samples. One common
factor was identified in both fish and birds, and this was the
presence of Poly Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), derivatives of
PVC and the banned pesticide, dieldrin - both of which are now
considered a major cause of organochlorine poisoning of some of
the world's oceans.
There are still only ideas and theories about their reactions/
causes in bodies, but at the time they are certainly thought to have
contributed to reduced fertility rates and chick weight problems
between 1986-89, as well as being factors which contributed to
deaths in 1994.
Eventually, what was regarded as a significant breakthrough
was achieved with the isolation in one bird of Avian Malaria. This,
we felt, was the result of someone looking specifically rather than
it being identified accidentally, so previous Post Mortems could
easily have overlooked the possibility as the condition has never
been prevalent in the UK, although it is widespread in American
collections.
More recently other collections in Britain have identified Avian
Malaria and although there is still need for further study we believe
we have now got to grips with the problem at the Cotswold Wildlife
Park. All our penguins are now given anti-malarial drugs and
appear in good condition.
As to why the disease appeared so suddenly and unexpectedly
we still do not know, but surmise the climatic changes we have
experienced in this country over the past 10 years have enabled the
carrier mosquitos to flourish.
Penguins have no immunity to Avian Malaria. The affected may
also have already been weakened by the level of pollutants in their
systems before the onset of the disease.
A final question is why Avian Malaria has been a problem in
only a limited number of collections to date? This and many other
questions need to be investigated and will be undertaken by the
Penguin Taxon Advisory Group, part of the Joint Management of
Species Programme under the auspices of the Federation of Zoolog-
ical Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland.
The endeavours of the last few years, and the future, have and
will continue to promote considerable investigation into many
aspects of penguin husbandry. We hope it will contribute to the

A pair of young White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus has been
received from Prague Zoo in a joint shipment with St. James&apos;s Park.
After completing quarantine a few weeks ago they were added to
the zoo's flock.
In the Southern Aviary, a pair of Abdim's Stork Ciconia abdimii
reared three chicks in a nest in a willow tree. Other recent
breedings include Eurasian Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus
which was hatched and parent-reared in the African Savannah
Aviary by the Bird House. An Inca Tern Larosterna inca hatched
in the Snowdon Aviary but did not survive.
A second Black-backed Fruit Dove Ptilinopus cinctus was
hatched in July and successfully reared by its parents. This pair has
now fledged four young in two years. The first three were males.
The sex of this latest youngster had not yet been determined at the
time of compiling these notes.
The zoo's pair of Imperial Green Pigeons Ducula a. aenea
continues to breed well and three young have been produced so far
this year. All those sexed to date have been females!
Other species hatched are: Livingstone's Touraco Tauraco
(corythaix) livingstonii. White-faced Scops Owl Otus leucotis ,
Lilac-breasted Roller Coracius caudata , Silver-throated Tanager
Tangara icterocephala and Emerald Starling Lamprotornis iris
(DNS).
A female Black and White Casqued Hornbill Bycanistes subcy-
lindricus has arrived from Lotherton Hall Bird Gardens (Leeds);
two pairs of Bali Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi have been received
from the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust; and a group of Com-
mon Waxbills Estrilda melpoda and their parasitic host, the Pin-
tailed Whydah Vidua macroura have been received courtesy of Mr.
Martin Capel.
London Zoo has organised the purchase of 14 fruit pigeons and
doves of five species - Pink-capped Ptilinopus re gin a. Pink-spotted
P. per lata, Jambu P. jambu , Black-naped P. melanospila and Pink-
necked Green Pigeon Treron vernans - from a private keeper.
The birds have been distributed between London, Bristol and
Chester Zoos to augment Zoo Federation breeding programmes
currently run by the Pigeon and Dove Taxon Advisory Group.

The zoo's male Andean Condor Vultur gryphus 'Carlos' has
been sent to the Yorkshire Dales Falconry Centre in exchange for
a female Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos tracheliotus. He has settled
well and is now being flown.
Finally the White Woodpeckers Melanerpes candidus have a
new enclosure courtesy, appropriately enough, of Tippex Limited!
With specially designed nest boxes sunk into upright tree trunks
and food dishes also inset into the trunks, it was hoped breeding
behaviour might commence rapidly. Unfortunately the male let us
down badly by dying suddenly, two days before the enclosure was
completed. Does anyone know of a spare male in the UK?

THE PRESIDENT'S GARDEN PARTY 1995

On Sunday 4th June some 75 Members and their guests accepted
the kind invitation of the Society's President, Miss Ruth Ezra, and
Vice-President, Raymond Sawyer, to visit their home at Cobham
(Surrey) and view their superlative collection of birds - together
with various mammals and giant tortoises - in a beautiful garden
setting.
This is the finest private collection in Britain - probably in
Europe - and we were blessed with a dry, if not warm, day. The
anticipated rain failed to materialise so that we were able to enjoy
a leisurely tour, seeing all manner of rarities.
It was also an occasion to meet fellow Members, some of whom
had journeyed many a mile to get to Cobham - although none more
so than Joseph Forshaw, Australian author of Parrots of the World,
The Birds of Paradise and Bowerbirds and other classic ornitholog-
ical works, who was holidaying in England at the time.
This was the third year we had admired a large aviary, now
surrounded by clematis and roses, which had been built in front of
the house in 1993. Among its inhabitants were Island Thrushes
which were breeding. Taxonomically, there are nearly 50 subspe-
cies endemic to a significant number of Pacific islands, ranging
from those of substantial size, such as Java and Borneo, to others
which are little more than a speck on the map.
The perching in this aviary is arranged so that the occupants fly
its full length when their real beauty can be appreciated. Among
occupants widely admired was a beautiful pair of Giildenstadt's
Redstarts.
Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes, together with Oystercatchers,
were much in evidence in lawned areas, but most of the giant
tortoises were inside - either close to, or under, heat lamps.
Parrotlike birds in the collection include pairs of Hyacinthine
and Scarlet Macaws, Eclectus, various Cockatoos, Keas, Stella's
and Red-flanked Lorikeets, Crimson-winged and Lutino Princess
of Wales' Parrakeets, and Philippine Hanging Parrots. Nearby we
saw Red-bearded, Carmine and White-throated Bee-eaters.
A young Splendid Starling had fledged earlier that morning, but
after being attacked by Stilts sharing the aviary it was quickly
recaptured and returned to the safety of the nest. There are three
pairs and a single male of these birds at Cobham, together with
Royal, Emerald and Amethyst Starlings.

Green Wood Hoopoes were nesting in an aviary which also
housed a Rufous Motmot - perhaps the only one in Britain. This
particular bird had escaped earlier this year but returned to the
aviary after a few days' freedom. On the day of our visit an Azure-
winged Magpie had decided to absent itself and there was general
concern that it would be recovered safely.
In the Tropical House - home to some superb exotics - a pair of
Splendid Sunbirds had hatched a single chick but unfortunately it
failed to survive. Close by, Long-tailed Broadbills were showing
clear signs of breeding behaviour while Rufous-bellied Niltavas
were nesting.
Other avicultural gems here include various hummingbirds,
pittas, Purple Honeycreepers, Scarlet Minivet, Greater and Lesser
Niltavas, Golden-headed Quetzal, Superb and Paradise Tanagers.
The latter birds had nested, but unsuccessfully. Among the house's
more active inhabitants was a charming group of eight Red-headed
Tits which seemed to be constantly on the move.
Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeons had reared young by the time
of our visit, as also had Avocets and Black-necked Stilts. Raymond
had bred Jacanas in 1994 and again this year so we were privileged
to see a single youngster, only a few days old, with its parents.
Other species to take the eye were Grandala, Giant Humming-
bird and Blue Whistling Thrush (which had also bred again this
year). I can't remember seeing a Blue-fronted Redstart before - a
beautiful bird. And for the show enthusiasts among the President's
guests there was a magnificent male Mrs. Gould's Sunbird which
appeared faultless.
Following a delicious tea, the Society's Chairman, Bob Hodges
expressed thanks on behalf of those present for the generosity of our
hosts in welcoming us into their home.
Finally, the occasion was nicely rounded-off when the President
presented Certificates of merit for first breedings to Chester Zoo

New from Oxford University Press, A GUIDE TO THE BIRDS
OF MEXICO AND NORTHERN CENTRAL AMERICA by Steve
N. G. Howell and Sophie Webb deals with 1,070 species found in
Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras and western
Nicaragua in a concise but informative way under such headings as
Identification, Voice, Habitat, Similar Species, Status and Distri-
bution, and Range - including an outline of the world range of each
species where applicable, other useful information is attached to
some species under the heading NB (Note) and may include useful
information about the taxonomic status of a species, and brief
descriptions of related or similar species that may be expected in
the region.
The layout of the book is typical of modern field guides with
greater emphasis on identification, voice and habitat than breeding
behaviour. As such it will be invaluable to birdwatchers travelling
to any of the countries covered. Range maps are provided for all
species' accounts.
Separate chapters deal with the area covered by the book,
geography and bird distribution, climate and habitat, migration,
history of ornithology in Mexico and northern Central America,
conservation, and birdwatching in the area.
There is much to be admired about this hefty, 850-page volume.
I particularly like the detailed descriptions of songs and call-notes
- thus for the Rufous-tailed Hummingbird Amazilia t. tzacatl : 'A
fairly hard, smacking tchik-tchik ... or tchi-tchi ..., at times repeat-
ed insistently, and dry, hard chips, often run into a rattling chirr-
rr-rr-rr-rr, etc. Song varied, high, thin, squeaky chipping, tsi, tsi-
tsi-tsit tsi-tsi-tsi, a shorter t'sin t'sit t'chin and tsi-sink si-siIk tsi-
sink , etc.'.
The 71 colour plates contributed by Sophie Webb are outstand-
ing. Their accuracy makes the task of identifying the region's
species that much easier and the book will thus be welcomed not
only by ornithologists and birdwatchers, but also by serious avicul-
turists. In addition to the colour plates, there are numerous black
and white illustrations of the same high quality throughout the text.
The book is strongly recommended to anyone with an interest in
the area's avifauna. It is an invaluable addition to even the most
comprehensive reference library.

In the United States, The Peregrine Fund has announced the
discovery of a nesting pair of Aplomado Falcons Faico femeralis in
Cameron County, Texas - the first record of a wild nest in 54 years.
In 1982, Peregrine Fund scientists discovered a remnant falcon
population in southern Mexico. The Mexican government permit-
ted 10 chicks to be taken from 10 different nests for rearing and
breeding at the Fund's World Centre for Birds of Prey in Boise
(Idaho). In 1993 and 1994, 26 young Boise-reared falcons were
released at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, near
Harlingen (Texas). 'The first wild nest in 54 years is a credit to all
involved', said Refuge Manager, Steve Thompson.

particularly eye-catching bird. But a pair of this infrequently seen
subspecies of the Large Niltava, in the collection at San Diego Zoo,

The adults chose a palm in their aviary in which to build a nest,
the female almost disappearing into the plant when she was incu-

is now in adult plumage. Meanwhile the female is incubating a

scheduled for renewal is the Rain Forest Aviary. Constructed in
1928, it is the largest walk-through aviary for Asian birds at the zoo
and currently houses 39 species. Together with the adjacent Parker
Aviary, structural, horticultural and 'predator-proof' refurbish-
ment will be carried out.
In 1980 the zoo embarked on a major rebuilding campaign to
transform old grotto-style exhibits into nine bioclimatic zones
which have been painstakingly designed to approximate nature,
while presenting animals as members of social groups rather than
lone representatives of their species. These multi-species exhibit
complexes allow visitors to observe animal behaviour as they relate
to their own species, in close proximity to naturally occurring
neighbours.

White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephaia populations have
declined dramatically this century, the main causes being hunting
and loss of habitat. The Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust has been
involved in the conservation of this species for several years and
reports that the Spanish population has recovered after being near
to extinction in the 1970s, while the main wintering site, Burdur
Gold in Turkey, is now officially protected.
Hybridisation with the North American Ruddy Duck O.
jamaicensis rubida remains a problem, however, and additionally
there is now a new threat to birds wintering in Greece.
The most important site for wintering White-headed Ducks in
Greece is Lake Vistonis which held 850 - 900 birds in December
1994. Though this has been designated a Ramsar site and Special
Protection Area, the Trust has recently heard that there are plans to
construct a large dyke to enable reclamation of marshland adjacent
to the south south-eastern part of the lake - exactly the area where
the White-headed Ducks winter. WWT has expressed its concern
and offered help to Greek conservationists.

The lack of small pools and other places where they can find
drinking water during the dry season, which have disappeared
because of climatic changes, together with the switch from growing
sorghum and millet in favour of maize, are thought to be the main
reasons for the scarcity of the most localised of the African
lovebirds, the Black-cheeked species Agapornis nigrigenis . This is
the conclusion of a survey into its status and distribution in south-
west Zambia, the results of which are published in the latest
Bulletin of the African Bird Club, Vol. 2, No. 2.
Altogether 2,127 were counted during the two-month period,
and the total population was estimated to be about 10,000. Tim
Dodman says, that during the dry season, there appeared to be two
sub-populations, a northern one of about 3,800 birds, and a south-
ern one totalling about 6,200.
Older villagers recalled how in the 1920s and 1930s, the love-
birds were far more numerous and were widely regarded as pests,
because they attacked their sorghum and millet crops. They were
able to earn a welcome income by trapping and selling them -
16,000 were trapped in four weeks in 1929.

BARN OWL RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996970862068966" page_id="56270667"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
Since the 1930s Britain's Barn Owl Tyto alba population is
estimated to have declined by about 70 percent. The loss of choice
feeding habitat has been identified as a major cause of this sad
decline. In addition, many traditional nesting places have been
lost. Old barns have been allowed to decay and collapse, or have
been demolished, while others have - and continue to be - converted
into expensive country homes for the human population.
Because of this The Barn Owl Trust launched its Barn Conser-
vation Research Project in April 1990, which monitored 20 sepa-
rate study areas in south-west England. It found that on losing their
nest site in a barn, the owls can disappear from the entire area, even
when there appears to be plenty of alternative sites they could move
to. However, if during the conversion of a barn, provision is made
to include a new nesting site for them, they are likely to return, and
activity may even increase slightly.
These are some of the findings published now in. Barn Owls on
Site , A Guide for Developers and Planners by Frances and David
Ramsden. A 48 page booklet, with 17 colour pictures, it is
described as 'essential reading for those involved in the develop-
ment of existing Barn Owl sites or wishing to encourage these
birds'. It also provides background information on problems Barn
Owls face, explains the protection given to them in the UK under
the Wildlife and Countryside Act, and is a practical guide for
anyone conducting a Barn Owl survey, wanting to identify or age
pellets, or simply wishing to know more about these enchanting
owls.
It is available from the Barn Owl Trust, Waterleat, Ashburton,
Devon TQ13 7HU, England. It is priced #5.00, which includes
postage and packing.

LITTLE EGRETS INCREASE IN UK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996440555555556" page_id="56270667"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
Until 1958, only 23 Little Egrets Egretta garzetta had been
recorded in Britain. During the following 30 years, up to 1988, that
figure rose to 458. The numbers have continued to rise each year,
and the totals for 1993 and 1994, both peaked at 400. They took the
overall total past 1,300, and it can no longer be considered a rarity.
Little Egrets bred in northern France for the first time in 1978,
and in Holland for the first time the following year and - according
to an account in Bird Watching, July 1995 - a juvenile ringed there
that year was shot in Lincolnshire later the same year. However,

they are most likely to be seen along the south coast of England,
from Cornwall to Sussex, but can turn up almost anywhere. In-
creasing numbers, most of them juveniles, thought to originate
from north-west France, start arriving in Britain in mid-July and
reach a peak in late August. Many remain throughout the winter
and, presumably, through into the spring. So, if this trend contin-
ues, surely it will not be long before this species breeds in Britain
- if it has not done so already!

Although somewhat delayed it is hoped that you will all enjoy this the
4th issue of 1995, namely Vol. 101 No.4. This issue contains the talks given
on Saturday 10th September 1994 at Bristol Zoo. Your council had wondered
what should be done to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Avicultural
Society. It was thought that a two day meeting held at a weekend would suit
most people who wanted to attend. A sub committee with Ken Lawrence as
chairman was set up in the autumn of the previous year to organise and keep
your council informed. The other members were Mike Curzon, Geoffrey
Greed, Stewart Pyper and Raymond Sawyer. Much thought and debate took
place and the offer by Bristol Zoo who have all the necessary facilities was
finally accepted. The Saturday would be talks, 6 to 8 in number, (eventually
7), followed by an evening dinner. Sunday morning would be a conducted
tour of the Zoo.
The directors of the Tropical Bird Gardens at Rode kindly offered to
allow members to view their collection in the afternoon and to provide tea.
This was readily accepted.
The theme of the talks was to be about what aviculture has achieved and
its future. A wide range of topics was required and hopefully when you read
them you will find them as interesting and informative as those who attended.
The Lord Mayor of Bristol agreed to attend our evening dinner and we
were all greatly honoured by her presence. The weather on the Sunday was
warm and sunny and the tour of the Zoo in the morning was well attended.
Duncan Bolton and Geoffrey Greed showed us around. Most of those
attending then went to the Tropical Birds Gardens at Rode where Betty Risdon
and Mike Curzon entertained us. As you are all aware Donald Risdon had
passed away in April.
This issue is completed with more articles very kindly sent in to the
Society. At present who will be your Editor is unknown. Please continue to
send in articles, notes etc., for publication to our address at Bristol Zoo at
present. Your subscriptions for 1996 are also now due.

The Chairman (G.R. Greed) opened the Centenary Celebrations by
welcoming all present on behalf of Bristol Zoo. He said that he was privileged
to be the honorary secretary/treasurer of this wonderful Society. He then
asked Miss Ruth Ezra, President of the Avicultural Society to officially open
the proceedings by saying a few words.
Miss Ruth Ezra - &quot;I am very pleased to greet you all here today. I am
proud to be President as my father was for many years. I hope that it will be
very successful and enjoyable. Very pleased to see you alF\
The Chairman continued:- Ken Lawrence and his team have organised
this seminar and had at the last minute to re-organise the programme. The
first lecture this afternoon will be Roger Wilkinson&apos;s.

The following talks were then given :-
R.C.J. Sawyer
Famous Aviculturists around 1950
Having had the chance to look through some of the old Avi cultural
Magazines , you will read about many different and wonderful things that
these members did. They were quite outstanding.
When I joined the Avicultural Society in 1949, there was only really
David Seth-Smith who was left to remind us of the early founder members.
He was a wonderful person who was curator of the birds at London Zoo. As
you know, he had a vast knowledge of all sorts of birds. He could relate back
to all the different founder members he knew in those days and was a very
interesting person to talk to. He was also Editor of the Society's magazine
for many years, and the backbone of the Avicultural Society. In those early
days he served as secretary and Editor in different times. All the council
members in those days lasted for a very short time. Our Editor Phyllis Barclay-
Smith who held down the editorship for 35 years, which is pretty remarkable,
was a great help to aviculture. She was a great help because she was in
contact with all the international conservation groups, which helped bring
together aviculturists and ornithologists alike.
Then we had people like Miss Maud Knobel who was secretary/treasurer
to the Society for many years who was another great character. We don't
have those people around today. She was secretary/treasurer for 26 years,
and was very fond of Parrots. If you should visit her house she had about 20
Parrots in her bedroom. After 26 years she relinquished her position as she
was getting on in years and a collection was made for her retirement. I
believe a total of #500, was raised, which was a lot in those days. She was so
thrilled she said she couldn't possibly retire and she would stay on. It fell to
David Seth-Smith the following year to tell her it really was time for her to
retire, as she had been in the job a long time. She never spoke to him again.
That goes for friends in the aviculture world.

Arthur Prestwich then took over who was another great secretary/treasurer
in the Society. When I joined the Society he was just secretary/treasurer and
he did a wonderful job for 21 years, with Kay Bonner, as his assistant. They
were of independent means and had an office in their house at Oak wood.
Kay Bonner used to do all the typing, and it ran very smoothly for 21 years.
He used to have a big collection of birds at Oak wood. He was awarded a
"first breeding" medal for the first Red-faced Lovebird. I went with John
Yealland to witness the breeding which took place in a bale of peat.
Our next secretary/treasurer was Harry Hors well. He was secretary/
treasurer for about 20 years. He kept quiet a large collection of Waterfowl
and Parrots. His assistant was Mary Harvey He was a wonderful host and
welcomed all members to the various meetings which were held.
In the old days there were wonderful collections, many of which were
documented in the Avicultural Magazines. Our past President Mr Ezra had
a most magnificent collection at Fox warren Park. On entering Fox warren
Park one was immediately aware of the peace of the place. Mr. Ezra also
kept a few birds in his bedroom. He had a Swallow-tailed Hummingbird
which he kept for some eight to nine years, which he let exercise around the
room. It was he who really discovered a food for nectar feeders, for in those
days nobody had really kept Hummingbirds or Sunbirds. His pioneering
diet, which is very old fashioned now, was Mellin's Food condensed milk
and honey, diluted with water. He had some wonderful species including
the Pink-headed Duck which were unique. His brother Sir David had sent
them from India. He let M. Delacour have one or two pairs but unfortunately
they never bred. With all the modern foods and diets available today, there
would have been much more possibility of them breeding, had they been
available then. In those days they were probably fed on wheat and middlings,
and they really hadn't got great varieties of foods. Mr. Ezra also started the
garden parties, where once year we all went and enjoyed the afternoon at
Fox warren.
These people, were the pioneers of aviculture because they had no
electricity in any of their aviaries as there was hardly any electricity then.
They had none of the facilities we have today such as ultra violet and infra
red lamps. At the places like Foxwarren they had boilers, which men used
to stoke up in the greenhouses.
I was lucky enough to know the Duke of Bedford. In fact he was quite a
friend. He died in an unfortunate shooting incident. His home at Woburn
Abbey was another quite remarkable place. He would take you round in his
taxi and know exactly where every herd of deer were lying in the 3,000 acre
park at different times of the day. He kept large collections of many species.
Crane, Waterfowl, and he was very well known for his Parrots. He had large
aviaries which his staff would push on rollers to a new site in the park every
six months, so that they didn't get infected with worms, because they didn't

have the wormers to deal with the birds like we have today. He used to have
shelters with small oil heaters underneath to keep them warm. He kept
Leadbeater&apos;s and Gang-Gang Cockatoos plus many other species out in the
middle of the park. This wouldn't be possible today because they would
most likely be stolen.
John Spedan Lewis was another pillar in aviculture and one of our vice
presidents who lived at Leckford on a large estate. He kept different species
going such as Owls and he tried to get every species of Owl. He had a
tremendous collection. Miss Chawner who looked after the collection bred
a number of Owls. Spedan Lewis also had Waterfowl and Cranes, but the
Owls and Cranes were gone by the time I visited him. He only kept Waterfowl
and Pheasants. He had Satyr Tragopans which he sold for #25 a pair, fairly
cheap in those days. Terry Jones managed the collections after Miss Chawner.
He was very keen on Waterfowl and fancy Pigeons. He was there for many
years until he retired. He still lives in Devon.
Jean Delacour was probably the greatest aviculturist of all time. As a
very young man he started a collection before the First World War had the
largest collection of birds that anyone had in France and even possibly Europe,
at the time. The collection was totally destroyed in the First World War.
After the First World War he brought Cleres, and started a collection again.
I remember him telling me as the men were coming out of the war he employed
112 to get the place as he wanted it. He got them to dig lakes by hand and
got all the aviaries ready by the following spring. He kept a magnificent
collection between the First and Second World Wars. They must have been
great days in aviculture, because so many birds of different species were
available. In those days the birds were escorted in by boat as there was no
air travel. There were collectors such as Walter Goodfellow, and Shaw
Mayer who used to go to New Guinea and collect many species of Birds of
Paradise. Cecil Webb collected many rare species from Africa. He was
curator of mammals and birds at London Zoo after which he went to Dublin
where he became superintendent. Jean Delacour collected numerous times
when in Indo-China.
These collectors were mainly sponsored by wealthy aviculturists and Zoos.
They used to go and collect birds and get them established, so that by the
time they got back to this country they were in excellent condition and make
them less difficult to keep. Wilfred Frost who must have been 80 when I met
him, used to bring back many interesting birds by boat. He used to live in
Singapore where he collected birds and then bring them back to London Zoo
where he would stay in one of the cattle houses at the Zoo. He used to live
with the birds until he had sold them all. He used to import a few mammals
as well. His eyesight got so bad he used to have to put his finger in the water
pots to feel if there was any water in them. I was able to obtain some Birds
of Paradise and other specimens from him in my early days.

Tom Goodwin was another collector. He used to go to Australia a lot but
always seemed to be unlucky. He came back just before the Second World
War with a big collection of Australian species and Bowerbirds for the late
Reg Partridge.
Reginald Phillipps, another noted aviculturist, bred Fairy Blue Wrens
and Regent Bowerbirds in a back garden in Hammersmith. I remember
around 1949/50 going to collect a crate of Hummingbirds from London
Airport. In those days the offices were only in army huts. I brought a crate
of some 14 or 16 Hummingbirds from a dealer called Randau in Brazil, for
#48, delivered. Twelve birds were supposed to be sent but he put in 16 in
case there was any losses on the way The captain had to be consulted before
any birds were taken on the plane, and quiet often he would have the
Hummingbirds in the cockpit with him. We used to have the same problem
with customs that we still get today.
Dr. Searle used to send me some birds from Hong Kong. Once he sent
me some Scarlet-backed Flowerpeckers, and on arrival we had to wait hours
for customs clearance. I was asked to look at the birds by the airport staff as
they thought they were all dead. The birds were lying on their backs. To my
amazement one of the bird's legs started to move and within half an hour we
had got them recovering thanks to help from the customs officers.
In the early 1950&apos;s I went with Claude and Dorothy Payne together with
Sidney Porter, who was another great aviculturist, (many wonderful articles
by him have appeared in the magazine), to Holland and I visited Louise
Bird Hall at Wassenaar Zoo. Their enormous greenhouse aviary was the
largest in Holland and they had flocks of Resplendent Quetzals and Cocks
of the Rock together with many more species. We spent several hours just
watching them. I mention this as we have Jan Louwman here today. As far
as I know we are the only two people who attended the Diamond Jubilee
Celebrations in 1954.
Dick De Quincy was another outstanding aviculturist. He took up birds
in a big way in 1950. He had kept a lot of birds before the Second World
War. He had a lovely place at The Vern, Hereford, where he built some
beautiful aviaries and tropical houses, and that is there where we bred the
Streamer-tailed Hummingbird. It was my cock bird that went on to win at
a National Show after he had finished his breeding activities. Dick was an
outstanding aviculturist who had great taste. Reg Partridge, was another
person who kept a great collection. Also Sir Crawford McCullagh Bart in
Northern Ireland was a great Parrot collector. He had a tremendous range
of aviaries housing a great variety of Parrots. In later years he became a
vice president of the Society and he also built up a large collection of
Waterfowl.
Sidney Porter was another outstanding person. He unfortunately died
when he was about 56 years old. He had terrible asthma. He used to go

abroad to avoid our winters. He lived in Derby which always seemed to be
permanently cold. He travelled all over the world to Singapore, the Indonesian
Islands and New Zealand bringing back unusual birds. In his later years he
often went to California. In New Zealand they had restrictions even in
those days. He was very anxious to bring back the Poe-bird or the Tui as it
is more familiarly known. It is a nectar feeder that appears black and is
sometimes called a Parson Bird because it had a white ruffle on the neck. He
used to tell the story of how he collected them. He had some cages made,
in which he put some Pigeons. When he got on board ship he let the
Pigeons out, and the Tui's, which had come on board in boxes, came back in
the cages. That is how he managed to bring them home. He also was a great
collector of books, of which he had some magnificent monographs, which
he left to Nottingham University. He always said that books would live
longer than birds.
Ken Norris was another great aviculturist and friend to the Society, who
had several first breedings, as was the late Donald Risdon. Donald bred the
first Umbrella Cockatoo. Keston Foreign Bird Farm, where Boosey and
Brooksbank lived, was one of the earliest dealers in the country, and the
most highest esteemed. Boosey was also a vice-president of the Society.
Noel and Ronald Stevens, used to live at Walcot. They kept wonderful
birds, and they built a lake, which was approx. 12 acres. It was very attractive,
but it was not very practical to breed Waterfowl on. They lived in a vast
mansion, but they gave up, and Ronald went to live in Ireland, and Noel
lived at Hope Bagot. They had a most impressive place. In fact they were
given all the park birds and deer from Foxwarren when Mr. Ezra died.
Herbert Whitley was another eccentric who unfortunately I never met.
He was an expert in animal husbandry and whatever he kept he succeeded
with. He had some very set ideas. Jean Delacour used to tell about his
enormous aviaries, with a pair of Crows in, while he kept many things like
Birds of Paradise in small enclosures. The year after when visiting Mr.
Delacour would say, "What are you doing with these Herbert?", and he
would say he was still studying them, and a year later they where still in
small cages. I don't think they every got out of them.
Paignton Zoo was his life and he was a very knowledgeable gardener.
He had little interest in people, so he used to come out (he was nocturnal)
and work at night in the greenhouses, and often undo what the gardeners
had done during the day. He did have a vast collection and Paignton Zoo is
now left in trust.
The big collections have long gone, bird gardens replace them. On
reflection, the most outstanding aviculturist of the century, must be Jean
Delacour.

Cranes in Aviculture
We are here to celebrate the fact that the Avicnltural Society , which has
been so kind as to ask me to speak today, has been in existence for 100 years.
One hundred years is a fair time, but Cranes have been around for rather
longer than this; Sandhill Crane fossils have been found dating back to the
time of the dinosaurs. These beautiful, tall, long-lived, graceful birds, pairing
for life, with vivacious dancing displays and loud calls have inspired
humankind for centuries. In many cultures, especially Japan, they are revered,
seen as symbols of good luck, of fidelity, and long life. In past times. Cranes
have been kept as pets, as watch-birds, and to be fattened for the pot. In
modern times, with half of the fifteen species endangered. Cranes are kept
in captivity for breeding: to safeguard flocks against disaster and to restock
declining populations. Apart from being worthy of conservation in their
own right, they also make excellent "flagship" species, ambassadors for the
dwindling wetlands where they feed and breed.
Until two years ago, despite the fact that there were several pairs of Cranes
in my father&apos;s collection, I had only a passing interest in Cranes. I was more
of a mammals person. Then in October 1992, I visited a friend who was
working at the International Crane Foundation, Baraboo, Wisconsin. I was
there for about five days. By the time I left, I knew I wanted to go back. I
spent the summer of 1993 at ICF, and I can safely say that I am now totally
besotted by these beautiful birds.
Housing
Cranes can be kept in a variety of pens. The African Crowned Cranes
and Demoiselles in particular have frequently been kept in large mixed
exhibits, both with other birds and with mammals. For breeding however, it
is usual to keep one pair of Cranes in a pen. The pen does not need to be
very large, 15 by 15 metres is fine. Pens may be open-topped or flight netted.
Open pens require the birds to be feather-clipped, pinioned, or otherwise
rendered flightless, and in a high wind a pinioned bird can still jump over
ten or twelve foot high netting, especially if the pen is on a slight slope.
Flight netting pens is expensive, and impractical with very large pens. It
can also be a problem in areas of high snowfall, and there is a theoretical
danger of Cranes getting caught in it, although in practice this appears to be
very rare. However, in addition to allowing the maintenance of fully-winged
pairs, which is advantageous for breeding, especially with the larger species,
flight netting provides protection for eggs and chicks from avian predators.
A pair of wild Cranes would have a breeding territory much larger than
15 by 15 metres, hundreds of hectares in some cases. In a captive situation,
it helps breeding if the territory is given a visual boundary. ICF uses green
tennis court netting in the breeding pens of Crane City. Whipsnade uses

wooden panels. Trees and bushes can be planted around the edges of the
enclosure for a similar effect
Most people will provide a shelter for their Cranes, although frequently
in a temperate climate it won't be used. However even in Manchester (which
isn't that far north) we shut our West African Crowned Cranes in on cold
winter nights, to prevent frostbitten toes, and in colder climates the tropical
species may require some artificial heat.

Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985479285714286" page_id="56270683"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
In the wild. Cranes feed on a variety of foodstuffs such as seeds, tubers,
invertebrates, small fish etc. In captivity they are frequently fed a complete
pellet food. Since the natural summer breeding time diet contains more
animal protein, less vegetable matter, it might be advantageous to feed a
lower protein maintenance diet in winter (perhaps 16% or 17%) and a higher
protein breeder diet (say 22% to 26%) in spring and summer, with extra
calcium. Fish or pinkies can be added to the normal diet as an occasional
treat. These can then be used to hide tablets, if necessary and to tempt the
appetite of a bird which isn't eating properly. Most Cranes are migratory
and their food consumption and weights indicate this, with considerable
seasonal variation in appetite and weight.
Health &amp; Handling
Injury and Cranes can involve two things: injury of the Crane, and injury
of people by the Crane. Cranes will attack with bill and feet. The former is
long in most species, for probing the marshland for food, is under excellent
control and will frequently be directed accurately towards the eyes. Especially
when dealing with the taller species, goggles are a wise precaution. I say
taller species, but there is a report of a Demoiselle Crane killing a human by
spearing through the eye. The feet are well armed with claws and can deliver
long scratches and deeper gouges to unprotected human legs and arms. Apart
from going for the eyes, most Cranes will attack the closest part of the body.
A broom or the sole an outstretched foot provide reasonably safe targets for
aggression in most instances. Some Cranes however will leap straight over
a broom to get at the person behind it, or will attack a broom-wielder more
vigorously than an unarmed person.
Cranes can injure their bills, breaking off a portion of the upper or lower
half, for instance while trying to escape through, or attack something through,
chainlink netting. If it is broken too far up it will not regrow and the bird
will be left with an uneven bill; in which case it is necessary to provide a
bucket with a deeper than usual depth of food.
A broken wing might occur if a Crane collides with a fence. Slings,
splints and surgical repair might allow the wing to heal; amputation is also
a possibility and a one-winged bird can do well, although it is a problem for
male Cranes at breeding time. A broken leg is a much more serious matter.
It is possible to put a bird with a broken leg in a sling for support while it

<bodyText confidence="0.990757590909091" page_id="56270684"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
heals, but Cranes do not tend to respond well to being confined in this way.
A Crane with a broken leg is, unfortunately, unlikely to survive.
If a large flight feather is broken while in the blood-feather stage, blood
loss from the broken shaft can be considerable. Treatment in this case is to
pull out the broken feather, followed by pressure to the skin and feather
follicle if necessary. Bleeding from a broken or over-clipped nail or bill tip
can usually be stopped by pressure, with or without a styptic such as silver
nitrate or potassium permanganate crystals.
Because of the potential for injury to Cranes and people, it is essential
when catching Cranes to be as quick as possible. Three or four people might
be required to corner a Crane, for an aggressive Crane it may be easier to
grab it as it attacks. I like to grasp a Crane by its neck just behind the head
with my left hand, and on the upper part of the left wing with my right.
Then I can feed the head behind me, gather the body and wings under my
right arm and grasp the legs at the hocks in my left hand, keeping one finger
between the two legs. The Crane can then be lifted up and, after the legs
have been stretched out behind it, it is usually possible to bend them up
under the body and hold them with the same hand that is holding the rest of
the bird, leaving one hand free. When releasing the Crane, the risk of it
injuring itself is greatly reduced if its body is supported until it is properly
back on its feet.
It as amazing how loud a response you can get from a metal detector held
up to some Cranes. I have personally persuaded a Crane to drop a three-
inch long nail rather than swallow it, and then had a race to see which of us
could grab the nail first. Although swallowed metal objects will not
necessarily harm a Crane, long sharp bits of metal such as nails can cause
injuries internally, and lead poisoning can result from lead pellets ground
down by stones in the gizzard.
Injury is probably the single largest cause of crane ill-health and death in
captivity. Bacterial infections occur sporadically, fungal infections
occasionally. Coccidia and worms are a more constant problem, as they
tend to build up in pens. On the whole, these do not cause clinical problems
in adult Cranes, but they can lead to reduced growth rates, illness and death
in chicks. If space allows, which it rarely does. Cranes should be rotated
between paddocks, giving each paddock a full year in which the numbers of
worm larvae and coccidia will decease considerably especially in a cold winter.
More practically, food for chicks can contain a coccidiostat if coccidia are
likely to be a problem and wormers such as Panacur (fenbendazole) can be
used to keep worm burdens to a minimum. It is also possible to have worm
egg counts done on samples of droppings to give an indication of the level of
worm problems.
Infectious diseases are not usually a problem in Cranes. However, in
1978, 20 Cranes in the non-breeder paddock at ICF died of Inclusion Body
Disease of Cranes or IBDC for short. This viral disease occurs in wild as

well as captive flocks, and should be checked for in imported birds. The
pair of Black-necked Cranes which ICF got from China after several years
of negotiation turned out on blood tests to have encountered this virus and
possibly still be carrying it. The pair are now in permanent quarantine,
always cared for after all the other birds, with overalls, gloves, wellingtons
and the use of plenty of disinfectant to ensure the virus is not passed onto
other birds. If another pair is used to incubate their eggs, the broody pair is
quarantined until the egg has been removed and they have tested clear. Chicks
are also raised in quarantine conditions. I should add that none of the chicks
or the broody pairs have tested positive to date.
Breeding
Most people keeping Cranes also wish to breed them. Nowadays there
are moves to concentrate on the rarer species, which is fine up to a point,
although I think it would be a mistake to stop breeding the "easier" species
then find that there are suddenly only old pairs left. Not that old age is
necessarily a bar to fertility in Cranes. A White-naped Crane, Casey, who
died this year at the age of 56 plus, left his young wife and three chicks
behind.
Breeding Cranes in captivity presents some problems, or challenges,
depending on how you like to look at these things. First, you need one bird
of each gender. Not as easy as it sounds since all the species are monomorphic.
In each species, male Cranes are, on the whole, bigger than female Cranes.
There is an overlap, however. In the wild, pairs always form with a taller
male than female, and this is wise to remember for pairing captive birds. In
all except African Crowned Cranes, it is possible to tell male and female
Cranes apart from the unison call. For instance in most species the males
gives a single long note while the female give two shorter calls. Also the
male usually moves his head further and lowers or raises his wings further
than the female. Modern techniques for surgical sexing and DNA sex
identification using blood samples make Crane sexing easier. There is even
research on the possibility of sexing Cranes on the basis of steroids in the
goop left in the shell after hatching.
Once you are sure you have a male and female, you want to put them
together and get fertile eggs. Not so easy. Cranes can be choosy about their
mates and, although it is relatively easy to get a semen sample from a male
Crane, a female will not usually lay eggs unless she feels herself to be paired.
Sarus Cranes can present a particular problem. Many pairs are known
which unison call and guard-call together, dance, show synchronous
behaviour, in short, all the signs of a true pair. Put them together, however,
and one day the male will scalp the female. No cure has yet been found for
this. The only way to get around the problem is to keep the pair separated by
a wire fence and use artificial insemination to get fertile eggs.

Not all Cranes are paired with their own species. The Black-necked
Crane, Tning Trung, surprised everyone by laying an egg last year. She
seems to think she is paired with the female Common Crane next door. One
of the reasons for the failure of the Grey's Lake Whooping Crane project,
which involved putting Whooping Crane eggs into Sandhill nests in the
hope that they would rear them and start off a new Whooping Crane flock,
was that Cranes as adults will tend to pair with the species that raised them.
In this case that meant Sandhill Cranes. In hand reared birds, humans may
become mates of choice, as with George Archibald and the Whopping Crane,
Tex. Two Siberian Cranes at ICF at present lay eggs each year after humans
spend time dancing with them.
At ICF, possible pairs are chosen based on genetics and on probable
compatibility. There is a basic routine for introduction, however the time
spent on each part of the process depends on the reactions of the birds
concerned. The stages are as follows:-
First, the birds are placed in adjoining pens, but with visual separation
by green opaque tennis court netting. Then the netting is removed for at
least part of the dividing fence. The Cranes are observed, with the observer
in a hide so as not to distract the Cranes. All actions are noted, giving a
running record of their behaviour. At the end of the observation period the
netting is replaced, until such time as the observation suggests this is no
longer necessary. The main behaviours watched for throughout the pairing
process are signs of aggression, which could lead to one Crane attacking the
other if they are not separated rapidly, and behaviours suggesting pairing,
which include performing similar activities close together and at the same
time as each other (synchronous behaviour) as well as more obvious unison
calling or guard calling together. Some aggressive behaviours such as bow
threats and drop wing threats are obviously aggressive. Others are less
obvious; a threat walk can easily shade into the more upright display walk.
A Crane which at first glance as you stop to look at it appears to be preening,
may actually be threatening, with it's attention not on its feathers but on
you.
After the birds have been in visual contact with each other, one bird is
introduced into the other's pen. In most cases the male is put into the female's
territory. This can be reversed, for instance if the female is quite a dominant
bird, or the male is nervous and overly affected by being driven. Again, the
birds are watched closely from a hide, close enough that the observer can
quickly intervene if there is aggressive behaviour. It is very important to
have a good feel for the birds, to know how much aggressive interaction is
allowable and when the birds should be parted. After about an hour, if all
has gone well, the birds are separated. The introduction is repeated daily,
using the same observer each time. When there are good indications of

another, they can be left together with just a check every so often. Initially,
this may mean being left for one or two hours working up to left together all
day Finally they are no longer separated at night.
One pair of Whooping Cranes I worked with were unison calling right
from the start and were left together permanently 2 weeks after being put
into adjacent pens. Another pair, White-naped Cranes, took nearly three
months of work. In both cases, the pairings were successful, with eggs and
chicks this year.
Most Cranes are seasonal breeders and day length appears to be an
important breeding cue. In fact, for some far-north breeding species, such
as Siberian Cranes, it appears essential to artificially lengthen the day with
floodlights mimicking the midnight sun. For Brolgas, artificial monsoon
showers seem to be helpful.
Even if you have a good pair, and are getting eggs laid, fertility can still
be a problem. Reasons for poor fertility include physical difficulties in mating,
due to toe or wing problems as well as poor semen quality. In addition, you
have those Sarus pairs who just can't be left together, all-female pairs and
birds imprinted on the wrong species. In all these cases, artificial
insemination is invaluable. This esoteric skill is not difficult to master with
good instruction and a little practice. It is, however, hard to describe properly,
but IT1 try. First, you catch your male Crane and hold him standing with his
head and neck sticking our behind you and his wings between your arms
and legs, while stroking up and down his thighs with your hands. With
luck, he relaxes, raises his tail, and purrs. The second person them comes
and massages the cloaca from all sides in a kind of milking action, then the
semen, usually 0.03 to 0.15 ml, is collected by running a smooth-lipped
glass up the outside of the cloaca.
The semen is then drawn up into a 1 ml syringe and diluted with semen
extender, or just physiological saline. For insemination of the female, the
bird is held as before, but the back and sides are stroked. The syringe is
placed into the cloaca, and preferably into the oviduct. This is the part of the
process which takes most practice to get right. The semen is slowly injected
and the syringe withdrawn. At Baraboo, optimum results have been obtained
from inseminating three times a week and immediately after an egg has
been laid, although there has also been success from a single insemination
after the first egg of a two-egg clutch has been laid, gaining a fertile second
egg. This approach may be best with nervous birds which are likely to be
disturbed too much to lay if subjected to repeated A.I.
In the wild. Cranes would lay a clutch of two eggs (more for the African
Crowned Cranes) and rear one or two chicks, depending on the species and
food availability. In captivity, it is often possible to increase this productivity
rate by removing clutches for incubation artificially or by other birds, with

the Cranes then hopefully laying again. Some Cranes will lay a dozen or
more eggs a year with this method. This has been extremely important with
Whooping Cranes and Siberian Cranes. The problem with the extras is,
who will rear them? Letting Cranes of another species rear chicks results in
birds, especially females, attracted to the wrong species later in life. Hand
rearing also presents some difficulties.
In a book on incubation, I once read a suggestion that all pheasant chicks
are suicidal. Having reared pheasants, I would agree. With Cranes, the
problem is more that they are siblicidal. Most of the species lay two eggs
and frequently hatch two chicks, but often only one, usually the older, survives.
In the species which do rear two chicks, this is usually achieved by keeping
the young chicks apart, one with each parent. When hand rearing, the
tendency poses a dilemma. In order to rear Cranes which know they are
Cranes, they should have plenty of contact with their compatriots. Give
them this contact and they will make spirited attempts to kill one another. A
partial solution is to allow visual contact through perspex walls. Even this
has to be discontinued if the chicks spend so much of their time trying to
attack one another that they have not time or energy left for other activities,
such as eating. If you only have one chick, a mirror can be provided so it
thinks it is seeing another chick.
Feeding can be encouraged initially by offering dampened food on a red
spoon held in an artificial crane head. It has been suggested in the past that
chicks should only be offered food after they are a day or two old, to ensure
proper yolk sac absorption, but it has now been shown that feeding in the
first day leads to no ill effects.
Crane chicks grow at amazing rate. They can gain an inch in height in
a day, and can put on 25% of their body weight in a day, although 10 - 15%
is a more sensible level of weight gain. It is because of this rapid growth
that exercise is very important. In the wild, chicks would be following their
parents for many hours each day. Hand rearing is most unlikely to manage
that, but exercise must be encouraged, if chicks are to grow with strong
straight bones. Whooping Crane chicks seem to be especially prone to leg
and toe problems, which may be related to their small genetic base, given
that the species has been built up from the low of 22 individuals in 1941,
and probably only about 14 genetically. Crooked toes can be splintered for a
few days to encourage straight growth.
At Baraboo, chicks are exercised as a group in a large yard. The (human)
chick parent on duty in the yard encourages the chicks to feed and exercise
and breaks up fights. Since young chicks are more pugnacious than older
ones, there is sometimes the funny sight of a small chick in vigorous pursuit
of a much bigger target, which can turn tragic if the large chick decides to
peck back. There is in the yard a "penalty box" which can be used to confine

a chick which is too aggressive for a while, or give safety to one which is
overly nervous.
If birds are meant for release, parent reared birds are best. Next best is to
isolation rear the chicks. This involves the human chick parent only appearing
dressed in disguising robes and hood, and with a glove-puppet "head" on
one hand. The chick doesn't hear human voices but only tape recorded
brood calls. Chicks raised this way have been included in the experimental
release of Whooping Cranes in Florida, although as they are only two years
old it is too soon to say whether they will pair up successfully.
The noted American conservationist, Aldo Leopoid said of Cranes that
they lie beyond the pretty and beautiful, in values "as yet beyond the reach
of words".
I won't be present when the Avicultural Society holds its Bicentennial
meeting. However, I can take some small satisfaction from knowing that my
efforts along with those of the Crane TAG in this country and many other
aviculturists all over the world, help to ensure that all fifteen species of
Cranes will still be around one hundred years from now.
Mike Reynolds - Parrots
It is a great privilege to be here today. I have been a member of the
Avicultural Society for quite a few years and I believe that resulted from my
wife making a deal with Raymond Sawyer that if he would join the World
Parrot Trust we would join the Avicultural Society. It is nice to be here
today and to be given a rather broad target in that I was asked to speak about
&apos;Parrots'. That certainly is a very rangy type of target.
The thing about Parrots is that they are special. They are special to us
humans because they have so much going for them. They have beauty,
colour, variety, are long lived, have this ability to speak up to a point and
they have a particular fascination. I believe they have more intelligence
than any other bird that I have become acquainted with, and I say that despite
being extremely fond of Cranes. Cranes are wonderful birds and are probably
number two in my personal list of birds, but Parrots have undoubtedly got
something extra. That is measured by the worst possible human measure,
money.
There aren't many birds that I am particularly aware of that have become
so closely associated with financial considerations and that is a complete
disaster for the Parrots. I will come back to that later on. What I would like
to do is just mention some of the birds that we have had experience of at
Paradise Park in Cornwall. For those who don't know, this is a Bird Park
that was started in 1973, by my wife and myself. Over the years we have
kept some fairly interesting, particularly Appendix 1 birds that we always
sought out on the principal that if you are going to go to the trouble of
keeping birds, you might as well keep birds that might hopefully benefit

from it in the long run, and that need attention. I would like to mention
some of the Parrots that we had particularly close and long lasting experiences
with over the years at Paradise Park.
I shall start with Scarlet Macaws. When I first started keeping birds
about 25 years ago, after leaving the advertising business, I was working
from home. I then started keeping one or two birds and it developed into
keeping Parrots. I wasn't really made captive until I saw a free flying Scarlet
Macaw, and after that everything else seemed to fall into place. It did rather
lead to moving to Cornwall, finding a suitable property and getting on with
setting up our very modest Bird Park.
We have a Scarlet Macaw called Alice. She was with us in 1972, and we
paired her up with a bird called Mac, and for twenty years they flew free
around our Park. They loved rain bathing. They had their favourite trees
and for some reason they were always fascinated by a circular window. One
particular time of year, I think October, they would go and sit in there quite
a bit. What the significance of that was I could never figure out. They loved
their morning biscuit given from our bedroom window. As a matter of fact
they did this for literally twenty years. In the meantime they were busy
breeding. My records show that over the full period that these two were
paired up, they produced no less than 55 young Scarlet Macaws. Now in the
early years, the 1970's, we would simply leave them to lay their clutch, and
let them raise them themselves, which they did with great efficiency. They
had two barrels, on a flat roof, one for roosting, and one for nesting. On
several occasions, we allowed the chicks to fledge with their parents, and
the sight of four Scarlet Macaws, just flying around above our place in
Cornwall was quite something. The only time it went wrong, was when
they had a clutch of three. They fledged and went through the usual rather
alarming processes of crash landing in trees for about three days. We knew
there was an element of risk in this enterprise, but on this occasion after
about five days one of them simply disappeared. We assumed it came to
grief possibly perched too low and was caught by a fox or something like
that. Nonetheless they probably are the most productive pair of Scarlet
Macaws that ever lived, although I am not too sure about some of the parrot
factories that are now developing in the USA.
After the 1970's we started to take the first clutch and hand rear them
and that's how we got into such high numbers that were produced by this
one pair of birds. They really have the full run of the place, and only rarely
did we ever keep them in. If we had a particularly hard spell in the winter,
then we would catch them up and bring them in. Their favourite perching
place was a copper beech which they chewed up a bit. Actually before I
come to the end of the story about these birds, that tree is now virtually
recovered because they were grounded for two years. What happened in
the end was that "Mac" developed cataracts, first on one eye and then on the

other. He really couldn't see at all. The interesting thing was his mate
would come and land on our bedroom window and she would be making
little calls and he would be hovering and homing in to land beside her. I
must say this always struck as an incredible piece of bonding, if you like, a
demonstration of the very serious and complete bond that you get with Parrots,
certainly the larger ones. What&apos;s happened more recently is that we had to
ground the pair of them and put them in an aviary, which was quite a large
one. Mac didn't like it and he went into a considerable decline and died.
After re-pairing, Alice was a very amenable girl. There were
complications with that, so we re-paired her with a bird we called Mac 2,
and they were released in March this year. We didn&apos;t clip Mac 2's wings,
we just let him go with Alice. She had been away from her roof top barrels
for 2 years but she immediately flew to the copper beech tree and he followed
her. She was showing him around. Unfortunately the story doesn't end
perfectly, because they have laid three clutches of two eggs this year and all
have been infertile. We are hoping they will be in better shape next year,
perhaps when the male has had a lot more exercise and got himself in better
shape.
The other thing that Alice did in 1977, was that she reared our first
Buffon's Macaw We had a pair of BufiFon's where the male was intent on
squashing the eggs. So we took a fertile egg and gave it to Alice and she
hatched and reared this chick, with no trouble at all. We did actually get
chicks reared by the BufiFon's, and we did it by this method. We realised the
male was considerably bulkier than the female, so we made an iron ring that
we fitted over the entrance into the nesting barrel. We had to make two or
three before we got it right. Eventually we had a situation where the female
could just squeeze in and the male couldn't. We saw his eyes popping out
trying to get in there, so as to sit on the eggs. Eventually they did rear two,
but Alice the Scarlet Macaw reared our first one, and accordingly to Rosemary
Low, it was probably the second breeding of the species world-wide. I think
she identified a first breeding in East Germany in 1968. So BufiFon's have
always been very important to us. We used to photograph Alice's chick
weekly but she didn't like this. This bird is still with us and in fact he
reared a chick this year, and three last year so it's been a good interesting
species for Paradise Park. Actually the first chick we took away at 10
weeks, and finished him ofiFby hand rearing. He really is an excellent bird.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos are birds that always appeal to us a great deal,
and we have bred a fair number. I originally had a pair from Newton Steel
who I am sure some people will remember from South Devon. It's a pair
that is still with us and still producing young.
We bred some Thick-billed Parrots in the early years. Ken Dolton bred
some one year and we came along and produced some the next year.
Unfortunately we have not bred any since 1984. I'd like to tell you that this

maroon-fronted parrot is currently with us in Cornwall, but unfortunately it
is not. A Mexican vet got in touch with us. He persuaded me to go to
Monterney, North East Mexico. I went to the place where these birds live
which is a very dramatic place. They nest in cliffs and we saw a flock of
about 30 or so swirling all around on the face of the cliff with a tremendous
noise coming from the wings, something I had not noticed before. It was
quite an experience. This is a species that is very endangered and according
to our friend in Mexico, there are not more than 600. There is a kind of
disagreement going on between him and other scientists who say there are
3,000.
We have had some success with Keas over the years and I suppose we
must have produced upwards of forty. I think we have got about 5 of them
this year. They are wonderful birds. The first clutch were parent reared. I
think we just pulled them from an underground cave, to get a photograph,
and then rapidly stuck them back again. They all did well. Then we started
hand rearing them and we now have two very productive pairs, and get
quite a lot of eggs from them. Unfortunately, we don't rear all the chicks.
We get some mysterious losses that we can't put our finger on. Nevertheless,
we have averaged about 6 young each year for the last few years.
I would like to tell you we are awash with Hyacinth Macaws, but it just
isn't true. We have struggled with these birds for twenty years, having had
about 8 fertile eggs but they have always succumbed at the point of hatching.
Why we get it wrong all the time I don't know. It is a magnificent bird to
work with. There is a lady who I met in the States who has just written an
article for our World Parrot T rust Newsletter. She bought one pair of Hyacinth
Macaws about 3 years ago, and she has produced 21 young. So it is a
puzzling bird. The Umbrella Cockatoo, Susie, was my personal pet for
perhaps 10 years, and then we turned her into a breeding bird. She used to
produce 4 chicks a year without any problems at all. I am very sorry to say
she was stolen from us along with 20 other birds in October 1992, and we
have never got them back.
I had better move on to the World Parrot Trust, because this is something
that we started in 1989. I first thought about 10 years previously that there
ought to be a Trust working specifically for the Parrots. If you look at the
work that has been done by the International Crane Foundation, the World
Pheasant Association, and the Wildfowl Trust, it is illogical that there
shouldn't be a Trust working just for the Parrot. I discussed this idea many
years ago with Peter Paris. Probably it was a good thing at the time that he
talked me out of it. Eventually in 1989 we launched this charity which has
the principle aim to help the survival of Parrot species in the wild. If s also
concerned with the welfare of every individual Parrot whether it is in the
wild, is in transit, being traded or living as a pet or whatever. We gave
ourselves quite a broad task. We have had placed a notice board at about 20

Zoos in the UK and one or two places overseas. We have just managed to get
one in at Parrot Jungle, Miami. Perhaps I should give you a very quick run
down on some statistics. The Trust has 2,000 members, it's raised nearly
#500,000 in five years and that money is not tucked away to guarantee
everybody pensions, which I think happens with some bird organisations. It
gets spent, and so we are constantly locating projects that need funds. We
go out and spend it. It is a kind of continuous cycle.
The first thing we got involved in was the Echo Parakeet on Mauritius.
We met up with Carl Jones and asked if there was anything we could do to
help his work. He said "Yes, get me a new four wheel drive vehicle". If you
meet anyone who is doing any sort of conservation work, they think you
might be good for a few bob. His landrover badly needed replacing and we
somehow raised #10,000 including a contribution of #2,500 from the Parrot
Society.
On Mauritius young Echo Parrakeets are being reared. Tim Lovegrove
is a New Zealander who has done a lot of work with Don Merton on the
Kakapo and many other enterprises. We funded Tim's going for six months
to join the team working there. He is a tremendous expert on things like
poisoning rodents which were a continual threat to the Echo Parakeet. Line
Wadam is one of our two World Parrot Trust organisers in Denmark. She
wanted to go and gain some experience. She went there, and made a very
valuable contribution.
What happens is we find a project, and give it some assistance. We let
people know we are helping, and hopefully we get more funding to help the
thing go a little further. It is a continuous process. The notice board is to
give the general public a picture of what is going on and why the Parrots
need our help. One of the things we did fairly early on, was to buy a bus
which is called The Jacquot Express. The basic idea came from Paul Butler
of RARE, who I met up with at one of the Parrot Conferences that go on. He
was bemoaning the fact that he had this marvellous idea, but it was too
expensive. He was proposing to buy a new Mercedes bus, which when he
thought about it needed to be short so it would get around the roads in the
Caribbean Islands. I found one in Cornwall. They sadly have all gone now,
those little 24ft busses. I managed to buy one for #1,500. We had to spend
a bit to do it up, but being a public service vehicle, it wasn't in too bad
shape. Then we created the exhibits to go in it. The first bus went to St
Lucia, and then others were sent to Dominica and St Vincent.
We fortunately have an artist local to us in Cornwall who was able to
paint the bus exteriors with all kinds of exuberant stuff. I must say it goes
down a treat in the Caribbean. In the interior the bus has a TV Video set
and in the back a couple of working models which show a good rain forest
and a bad one. What happens is you press a button and it rains. In the good
rain forest the water gets properly filtered and comes out as pure water. In

the bad rain forest, where you can see the forest is virtually cut down, bananas
are creeping up the hillside and roofs fallen in on the houses, the water
which comes through it, looks as if is has met a tea bag on the way and
comes out rather murky. I&apos;ve tried to make the point that it is not just for the
benefit of the Parrots, it's for the benefit of the people that the forests are
preserved. This message has been very well received to the extent that we
now have been commissioned to do a similar bus for Paraguay. The British
Ambassador came to our place and saw some information about these buses
two years ago. He has been pursuing this ever since and he has even extracted
money from the Foreign Office to buy the bus. We have just extracted
another sum to do the interiors. These buses have been quite a success.
On St. Vincent we gave some funds to assist the breeding facility they
have there. It has been quite successful. I think they have bred 13 or 14
chicks in the last four years or so. Fitzroy Springer is in charge of the
aviaries. He's been to Jersey and he has been to spend a couple of weeks
with us in Cornwall. I think he knows all the young birds that he's got
there. We sent Andrew Greenwood over there recently to do a report on the
aviaries and the whole future of the programme. There seems to be some
uncertainty about why they maintain these birds in the aviaries and why
they are breeding them. They don't want to send them out of the Island.
There are a whole load of problems to be resolved and various people are
working on that now
One interesting fact (I am told it's a fact), is that Ramon Noegel who has
bred a lot of these birds in Florida has apparently just sold the whole lot to
Bernie Levine of Parrot Jungle for allegedly $ 1,000,000. So I think you are
going to find a lot of very commercial St Vincent Amazons emerging as
time goes by.
Paul Butler came to visit us. One of the reasons we have been so interested
in St Vincent Amazon is that the government sent us a pair in 1974. It took
us till 1990 before we finally bred one. We are asking the authorities on St
Vincent to let us have a male, as they have surplus males on the Island, to
pair up with the female we have bred. We are waiting to hear. The only
other thing about the St Vincent Amazon, is that we have hatched another
one a month ago. We are making progress, but it is painfully slow.
In 1990 we launched the Hyacinth Fund, wanting to make use of this
bird as a flag ship species. We raised reasonable funds, but nothing
spectacular. It enabled us to support some of the work being masterminded
by Charlie Munn who is probably the world&apos;s leading Macaw researcher. He
spent about 18 years in Peru, Bolivia and Brazil studying Macaws and
particularly in recent years he has dealt with the value Macaws have as a
contributor to ecotourism. We were able to contribute towards this work
and also in particular funded the additional nest boxes which were something

that was found to be necessary. That was in the Pantanal. It appears there
is intense competition for the nest trees in that locality.
For Lear&apos;s Macaw, we used some of the funds we had in the Hyacinth
Fund to begin working with this species. It is a very tricky situation. These
birds depend for the majority of their food on the Licuri Palm, and it had
been chewed up by cattle and goats. They are flying farther and farther
afield sometimes as far as 100km in a day, when they have chicks. So we
identified the task of planting substantial new quantities of these palms in
localities nearer to the birds breeding and roosting areas. That's a programme
we have underway, because those are the palm nuts they rely on. I have to
say that the most recent information I have is encouraging. Whereas before
we thought there were no more than 60 Lear's Macaws I now have a report
of 118. That's the latest official total from Brazil. There's a flock of 90
which is apparently flying around and raiding maize fields. They had a
tremendous drought for several years, but they had excellent rains last year.
So the crops are good, but the Macaws are putting themselves at risk by
attacking the farmers&apos; crops. Where they live and breed, they find crevices
in rocks, to make their nests.
I went to visit Nelson Kawall in Sao Paulo who has amongst other
things Spix's Macaws and one Lear's Macaw. We were trying to manoeuvre
this bird to get a decent photograph, but it decided to play dead. It was
quite alarming at the time. Nobody knows the history of this bird but
presumably in some previous existence it has been trained to roll over and
play dead. It's very sad really as this is a female, there is a female at Sao
Paulo Zoo and Harry Sissen has a male that is very old. I think he has a
female still, and there are two females I have also visited and photographed
in Busch Gardens, Tampa, Florida.
Regarding the Spix's Macaw in the wild. One of the things we did was
to part-fund an expedition which went to establish how many were left. It
was hoped there were either three or five, but they only found one. That bird
is still there, and several years on there are still people talking about putting
a bird out there to join him. I'm afraid it looks as if it is going to be a while
before this talking is turned into action. Perhaps we will learn more later
this month at the Loro Parque Conference.
The Spix's Macaw is exhibited at Sao Paulo Zoo. They have a pair there
that were confiscated and found in the hands of a dealer from Paraguay. A
very good potential breeding situation but they have showed no signs at
present. Other people have bred them in captivity.
A situation we got involved in, and we really shouldn't have, was where
there were several hundred Goffin's Cockatoos being held by a trader in the
Tanimbar Islands. It is a stronghold of this species. We went to a lot of
trouble to get them released with government approval. Frankly not all of
them could fly but they eventually released 319. My guess would be that

maybe 200 would have made it back into the forest. They had been blood
tested to finally ensure that they were not carrying any diseases. All in all it
wasn't a very sensible thing for us to get into. We felt it was a welfare issue
and we should try to do something. The bird had just been put out on
Appendix 1. We also contributed to a survey by Bird Life International
which shows there are 400,000 Goffin's Cockatoos on Tanimbar. So it is
possible they may now be taken off Appendix 1.
Quickly to Australia where we have a project going involving the Red-
tailed Black Cockatoo, not the one that is rather numerous but an endangered
sub-species called Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne which means
'beautiful woman'. The females have more colour than those of the nominate
race, with speckles around the face. There are maybe no more than 500 or
1,000 of these left in a corner of Victoria and South Australia. We asked
Joe Forshaw if he could find us a good project in Australia and he came up
with that. We supported it for three years and are committed to supporting
it for another 3 years.
We had a remarkable day down there when we went out with Joe Forshaw,
Bill Emerson, who is in charge of this programme, a local MP, press and TV.
We went in one of those cherry picking vehicles. We got up and looked into
some of the nests that they were supervising. There is a danger of these
birds being stolen. There is a farmer who we pay for a certain period of the
year to check and protect the nests.
Martin Ballam has been with us at Paradise Park for a number of years.
Over the last 5 years since we started the World Parrot Trust he has been
doing flying demonstrations with Eagles and other birds as well. He has
actually raised as of about 2 weeks ago #70,000! In the middle of his
demonstrations he stops and gives people the most amazing description of
the work of the World Parrot Trust and asks them to empty their pockets
into a collecting box on their way out. He is pretty ruthless and he has
raised all that money.
If I could close by suggesting that if you have the privilege of enjoying
the Parrots in your aviaries, then I do think it is entirely natural for me to
suggest that if you enjoy these birds in captivity, then you have a certain
responsibility for them, not just in captivity, but also in the wild. After five
years of working on the World Parrot Trust, this is the essence of the
message that we have. We find that the vast majority of the funds we get
come from aviculture, but probably it is true to say 95% of the people involved
in Parrot aviculture don't think beyond their back yards. We have a
considerable task to make people understand that they have this responsibility
for parrot conservation.

Dr R Wilkinson
First Breedings at Chester Zoo
Chester Zoo has a long association with the Avicultural Society , firstly
through its founder Mr George Mottershead. Coincidentally 1994 is the
centenary of the Avicultural Society and also the Diamond Jubilee of Chester
Zoo. It is an honour to be asked to speak today at the Avicultural Society
Centenary as this is such a distinguished Society. It is an important Society
in many ways, not least because of the Avicultural Magazine , which has
brought aviculture into the fold of ornithology. I think this is a very important
achievement for the Society.
Some of the other important aspects of the Society include the social
functions. People get together getting to know each other and to trust each
other. Trust is important because we have got to start working together for
aviculture and to start co-operating for aviculture. We can't afford to think
of ourselves as single little entities.
I was asked to talk about first breeding successes at Chester Zoo. Success
if often very short lived, and that is going to be one of the themes for this
particular talk.
First breedings are fun, they are educational, but they are only a beginning.
We have had our good share at Chester especially in the last 30 years. It has
been great to have them, but you have got to ask the question, "where do you
go from there?" We have looked back at the last 100 years in this morning's
contributions. We have got to look forward to the next 100 years and make
sure we still have those birds we need to continue in aviculture.
There has been a great resurgence of trade recently - but how long will it
last? What I really want to point out today is, as we go through some first
breeding successes, is where so many of them have faltered later. I don't
think this is just true for Chester Zoo. It is true for most aviculturist's and
most zoos. What as a Society do you think we should do?
The Avicultural Society gives awards for first breedings; medals for its
individual members and certificates for zoos. Perhaps we should find some
way of recognising those aviculturists who have achieved sustained breedings
and have worked hard for aviculture. We haven't really found a way of
recognising those particular members, but we all know them, and I think it
is very important to reward them. Some of us are more privileged than
others. We may for example have the finances to buy rare birds which have
not previously been bred. Others have privileges, as indeed has Chester
Zoo, of working with zoos abroad and to import new species from them to
obtain first breedings. But what we really should be looking at is not a first
breeding, or even second breedings but sustained breedings over generations.
This is something that the Avicultural Society needs to address within the
next decade, perhaps even in the new few years.

George Mottershead was the founder and first director of Chester Zoo.
George Mottershead's first letter for the Avicultural Magazine was about a
white Swallow he had seen passing over the zoo. The Avicultural Society is
not just concerned with birds in captivity. From its inception it has been
dedicated to the study of foreign and British birds in captivity and in the
wild. The first "first breeding" reported from Chester Zoo by George
Mottershead was that of a Griffon Vulture bred at Chester in 1940. This was
a very important breeding success.
The next success that Chester Zoo was credited with was in 1966 with
Sclater's Crested Curassow (now more commonly known as the Bare-faced
Curassow). Since they were first bred in 1966 more than 40 Bare-faced
Curassows bred at Chester Zoo have been sent on loan, many to zoos abroad;
the farthest being Ueno Zoo in Japan.
Pallas's Sandgrouse is one of the breedings during my period of
curatorship which was very exciting. We received five captive-bred Pallas's
Sandgrouse from Rotterdam Zoo, with which Chester has had a long
association. I believe this is very important because quite a number of birds
are worked with at both zoos. Two chicks were reared from four hatched in
1985 and another chick reared in 1986; but after that we started having
problems in hatching eggs. Some birds were moved to Paignton Zoo but
four years later the whole population had died out. It wasn't enough just to
have had the four or five birds to start with. There were no other birds in the
country. The five birds we started with were all siblings so inbreeding may
have been a problem.
I didn't know that Chester Zoo was credited with the first breeding of
Pied Imperial Pigeons until I looked through Dave Coles' very useful little
book "First Breeding Records". That first breeding had been credited to
Chester from one bred, presumably in the large Tropical House, in 1964.
Since then the species has been represented at Chester Zoo for many years
and we have recently received two pairs of captive bred birds from Paignton
Zoo.
Chester is well known for its Musk Lorikeets. Again four birds arrived
originally from Rotterdam Zoo in 1986. Although chicks were hatched in
1987 these didn't survive. Between 1988 - 1991 a number of birds were
hatched of which six were reared. Following a number of losses, we were
then left with four females. At that time, there were no other birds in England.
Subsequently some were imported into the UK by Rex Merritt but we then
had already agreed to return our four females to Rotterdam, where they had
unpaired males.
We have worked for a long time with Lesser Patagonian Conures at

Chester. Chester was credited with the first breeding in 1971. W R Partridge

purchased by Chester Zoo from Harry Liptrott, who some of you may
remember had his premises by Marton Mere near Blackpool. Three chicks
were hatched in 1971 as reported by the then Curator of Birds, Bill Timmis
in the Avicultural Magazine. Going through our records I discovered that
ninety-nine Lesser Patagonian Conures had been bred at Chester most of
which had been sent to other collections. More recently Chester received a
Zoo Federation award for meritorious breeding of Lesser Patagonian Conures
sustained over a number of generations.
Our colony of Lesser Patagonian Conures produced yellow birds over the
years. They had dark eyes and were not lutinos although it appeared at first
that this was a sex-linked mutation. It now appears that it might have been
a simple recessive. It is zoo conservation policy not to selectively breed
from mutations. As such we felt it was better and more appropriate to allow
these mutations to go into private aviculture. Three different people have
received this mutation and presently Harry Sisson has two or three of these
yellow birds plus their surviving relatives. We no longer hold Lesser
Patagonian Conures at Chester but are hoping that soon we may start working
with the Greater Patagonian Conure which is a more endangered sub-species.
We received a bird from Antwerp which has now been paired at the Tropical
Bird Gardens, Rode. We hope that with good co-operation the Greater
Patagonian Conures may be established in the same way Lesser Patagonian
Conures have.
Crimson-bellied Conures were bred at Chester in 1976. These birds
again came from Rotterdam Zoo; three were bred in 1976 and three more in
1977. Two were sent to a private breeder and a single death was recorded in
1977. No more breedings were subsequently reported from our stock which
were then two males and one female. These were returned in 1983 to
Rotterdam Zoo, who successfully continue to breed this conure. Recently
we were offered some back but had to decline because of lack of space for
this attractive but non-endangered parrot.
Another species for which we were awarded a first breeding in 1981 was
the Slender-bellied Conure. A pair was purchased in 1978 then a second
pair in 1980. No breedings took place until 1981 when four chicks were
hatched of which three were reared. In 1983 both pairs bred producing a
total of eleven youngsters. In 1985 we had another six hatch of which four
were reared. In the first years everybody wanted our youngsters but later
nobody was really concerned. This is a difficulty we have found for many
different species. When you first start breeding a species that has previously
been rare in aviculture then everybody wants to work with it. Very soon
there are about 10 or 12 pairs about in different collections and then interest
soon wanes. Chester is still working with Slender-billed Conures, having
bred four this year. To date we have bred nearly thirty of this species.

Continuing with Parrots for which, to date, Chester has a good reputation,
we had a first breeding in 1985 for Lesser Vasa Parrots. Our original pair
came over from Switzerland. This was arranged by Peter James, who was
assistant Curator of Birds at the time. At that time Lesser Vasa Parrots were
an avicultural rarity. A couple of years later, large imports arrived into the
UK and the market was flooded but still very few people bred them. I think
now you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of people who
have bred Lesser Vasa Parrots. To date Chester has reared 23 chicks, not
including several still in the nest this year.
Greater Vasa Parrots are one of my favourite parrots. We started working
with these after having had successes with the Lesser Vasa Parrots. We first
reared Greater Vasa chicks in 1990 and subsequently have had chicks every
year since giving a total (including four chicks this year which have just left
the nest) of 17 birds. Again we have the same problem. How many people
are breeding Greater Vasas? Ken Dolton is, but how many others? The
answer is very few. Even now I am listing them on the Zoo's surplus list but
nobody inquires for them.
This highlights another problem that we have to face, the disposal of the
surplus birds we breed. I know we all use dealers when necessary but we
don't know where the birds end up. We spend a lot of time breeding birds
and working hard with them so we don't want them to end up in totally
unsuitable accommodation. Within the Avicultural Society we should work
together to a greater extent in the future to move birds around amongst our
members.
Fire-tufted Barbets were another first breeding at Chester. The barbets
were great to work with. They used to chisel out an old nest-log that had
been put there initially for White Woodpeckers, which we were breeding at
that time. We learnt a lot from working with these birds. Like some toucans
we found that in some pairs of barbets either the male or female would
suddenly become aggressive during the breeding period. During the time
there were still chicks in the nest we had to be very careful because we often
didn't know which way to go, and had to be ready to pull either the male or
female out or else we would lose one or the other. However, by working with
them skilfully our keepers managed to rear quite a few of them at that time.
Again we had the problem that nobody else was working with them at that
time. We sent young barbets to various other collections including London
Zoo where I believe at least one of the birds still remains.
Having gained some experience with Fire-tufted Barbets and also with
breeding Crimson-rumped Toucanets, we decided that we would try one of
the larger toucans. We purchased a pair of Channel-billed Toucans from
"Ravensden" in 1984 and first bred them in 1989. We have reared 15
youngsters to date. We kept back the first female that we bred in 1989 and
purchased a wild caught male for her. We are hoping to soon start breeding

from this second pair. They are looking good this year, having been in and
out of the box a few times. It has taken a long time but until we can actually
get to second-generation we can't really claim to have been successful with
Channel-billed Toucans. We have been successful in breeding from one pair
consistently but that is not going to keep the species going in aviculture.
We first hatched African Grey Hornbills in 1988 and 20 chicks have
been reared since. Their offspring have been sent to various collections but
how many of them are now breeding? The majority of birds that are now
available are related to Chester's which creates another problem. Clearly it
would have been better to have started with a larger founder population.
Two Trumpeter Hornbills were reared in 1989, again a UK first breeding.
Since then we have reared a total of 13. Again young have been sent to
Hare wood, Paignton, Banham Zoo, Walsrode and quite a number of private
collections. Trumpeter Hornbills should have a future because four or five
other zoos are now breeding them. If the interest is retained these could be
established unless another species comes along and displaces it.
Another first for Chester was with Red-headed Laughing Thrushes. There
is now a lot of interest in Laughing Thrushes. The Passerine Taxon Advisory
Group have concentrated on these with Dave Coles, a Laughing Thrush
specialist running various stud-books. Chester first bred Red-headed
Laughing Thrushes in 1974, and then bred them for some years subsequently.
1983 was our last breeding. By 1986 we still had the parents of the previous
youngsters but they failed to breed from 1983 to 1985. Padstow who had
some successes with Red-headed Laughing Thrushes were sent these birds
in 1986. Unfortunately, Padstow has now closed.
Shortly after arrival at the zoo, Wagler's Oropendolas bred in the Tropical
House in 1982. Only the one chick ever fledged. The colony of ten birds
then dwindled and finally died out in 1990. I wonder whether releasing a
pair of Giant Cowbirds in the Tropical House, which in the wild are brood-
parasites of Oropendolas, may have disturbed the Oropendolas when
breeding? However, there was no obvious evidence of harassment or pressures
from the cowbirds and in the wild cowbirds, unlike cuckoos, are reared
together with the host young.
The Baya Weaver was bred in 1980,1 believe in our Finch Flight. These
were transferred to the Tropical House in 1984, but the last of the survivors
escaped when the roof was damaged in 1990.
First bred in 1989 the Taveta Golden Weavers were received as Golden
Palm Weavers but later re-identified. These bred in the free flight of the
Tropical House. In 1989 we fledged six Taveta Golden Weavers from one
breeding female. That breeding female then died, disappeared or escaped so
ending this story. We have now half a dozen males but where can we find a
female Taveta Weaver? It is going to be terribly difficult to find mates for
the males.

Also in the Tropical House, White-headed Buffalo Weavers bred
successfully in 1989. White-headed Buffalo Weavers built a huge nest of 2&apos;
to 2&apos; 6&quot; diameter like a huge ball in the top of a palm tree. The nest had a
number of openings and I suspect we had two or three different females
breeding in this nest, each with different chambers. More recently. Pied
Imperial Pigeons dismantled the whole nest so ending the breeding of the
White-headed Buffalo Weavers.
Long-tailed Glossy Starlings have always been favourites of mine. I
worked for six years in Nigeria where these birds live. It is a very difficult
bird to study in the wild. I spent hours trying to find their nests to be able to
study their behaviour. I never succeeded. Then when I came to Chester Zoo
we bred them in the Tropical House and I was able to document previously
unknown aspects of their breeding biology. The first breeding of Long-
tailed Glossy Starlings at Chester had occurred 10 years before but had not
been documented. With this new information we were able to claim another
first breeding for Chester.
Geoff Masson from Paulton Park loaned Chester a pair of Ashy Starlings
which were causing trouble in his mixed aviary. We received them in 1988,
and in 1989 had the first breeding. We bred from this pair on two occasions,
but then the male died. The youngsters were both females and with no other
Ashy Starlings in the country this ended our breeding history. We thought
we would be better prepared next time. African Pied Starlings had always
interested me and in 1991 we imported six birds from Tygerberg Zoo, South
Africa. After quarantine all six were released in the free flight in the Tropical
House. We started having problems when these proved susceptible to
gapeworms. Our first successful breeding was in 1992 after several previously
unsuccessftil breeding attempts. However in 1993, even though we had started
with six birds, we were left with only two females.
San Bias Jays present a similar story. After our first breeding in 1976,
we were very successful for a few years. We then had problems again with
gapeworm. We had to take chicks from the nest at about a week old and
finish them off by hand-rearing to avoid infection.
The best of Chester Zoo's bird breeding successes was in 1968 when the
Superb Birds of Paradise bred. Bill Timmis reported this breeding in the
Avicultural Magazine. 1968 was the same year that Princess Stephanie's
Astrapia was bred at London Zoo. I think these were the only two breedings
of Birds of Paradise in this country. It's sad considering how many came in.
Wouldn't it be wonderful to have those now? I'd love to be able to work with
them.
Our most recent first breeding, for which we have to thank Taronga Zoo,
Sydney, is that of the Tawny Frogmouth. We received four birds from Taronga
in 1981. Two of these died in the first year leaving us two males. We then

<bodyText confidence="0.999526953488372" page_id="56270703"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
worked hard to try and find females for them. Despite various promises
nothing ever materialised. Eventually in 1993 we received two hand-reared
females from Taronga. We had a lot of trouble getting the females together
with the males but eventually succeeded. Both pairs laid this year but only
one was fertile. From this pair the first clutch disappeared at the end of
incubation, just as we were expecting them to hatch. We suspect the chick
might have been eaten but we never knew as we didn&apos;t find any evidence.
So the second clutch of two eggs were taken away and put into the incubator
One chick hatched, an incredible fluffy little thing which looked like
something out of space. This one we successfully reared. We hope we are
going to be able to continue working with Tawny Frogmouths as there are
presently quite a number of birds on the Continent. So if we work together
we should be able to keep them going.
Finally, I would like to mention a few breedings that were not first
breedings, but I think, in their way, were more successful. From four Chilean
Tinamous received at Chester Zoo in 1980, a total of 172 bred were sent to
other collections. Some of these still remain, for example at Child-Beale.
Four pairs of Mexican House Finches were donated by Customs and Excise
in 1983. Since then we have bred 75, which all went on to different
collections. Not an endangered species, nor a managed species, but more of
a success I feel than were some of our first breedings. With Humboldt's
Penguins, Chester Zoo had some success between 1986-89. In those four
years we bred over 40 and sent them to other collections including Newquay,
Whipsnade, Harewood, Merley and Copenhagen. We thought we were doing
really well but then over the last few years we have had difficulties. Thank
goodness that the birds that were sent elsewhere are now breeding. Penguins
bred at Chester are now breeding at Antwerp, Copenhagen and in various
other collections. Overall the population has gradually increased and the
Humboldt's Penguin population is now being managed at a European level.
If we take part in these sorts of breeding programmes, even if we appear
for a time to be losing birds in our own collection, it should balance overall.
I think we all have to accept that with some species, at some times, we are
going to have problems. However, by working within a broader programme
we have the advantage that deficits at one collection can be balanced by
gains at another so enabling the whole population to move forwards.
A similar story can be told for Waldrapp Ibis. This is another programme
that now is managed in European Zoos. A total of 38 Waldrapp Ibis have
been reared at Chester since 1990. In fact the programme is now so successful
that we may need to find ways to stop breeding them. Already zoos on the
Continent are talking about the need to reduce the number of breedings
because of difficulties of finding enough good homes for the youngsters.
Flamingos do need better management. We are rearing perhaps three to
six Caribbean's and a similar number of Chilean&apos;s annually at Chester. This

is only just above the death rate. Although we are increasing these stocks
slowly, with the demand for the birds we produce we could increase it a lot
more before having problems in finding collections to take any surplus.
Debbie Bourne talked to us at this symposium about cranes. It is really
important that we have good managed programmes for cranes. We have
now produced six youngsters from one pair of Red-crowned Cranes, the last
two chicks this year where both reared by the parents. Initially we were
using bantams. Debbie didn't mention that bantams are a very useful way of
rearing cranes as an alternative to them being hand reared.
Ten Ajidean Condors have been reared at Chester but because of the
unpredictable behaviour of their parents all have been hand reared; the last
ones with the use of condor "puppets". We are already now at a stage where
breeding must be slowed down or every Andean Condor in the country could
be related to ours.
Spectacled Owls are difficult to breed. Over the period 1984 to 1991 we
reared only five chicks. It should have been a lot more than that. We now
have a "Joint Management of Species Programme" in the UK for Spectacled
Owls. The population has increased very slowly with only a couple more
birds now than we had five or six years ago. It is going to be very important,
if we are going to contain these beautiful Owls in our collections, to continue
to work very closely with each other.
AJan Griffiths was the first person to breed Blue-eyed Cockatoos in
1964. Chester came onto the scene a couple of years later when five birds
were purchased from Mr Best in 1966. We first reared a chick in 1973 and
since then have reared 23. We have now birds out on loan to Rotterdam,
Paignton and Paradise Park and another two collections are shortly to receive
them. Our difficulty is that most of the offspring are from one pair so we
need to look, perhaps, to the United States for some fresh blood.
Finally, and perhaps the most important bird of all is the symbol of the
Avicultural Society , the Rothschild's Mynah. This is one case where, perhaps,
aviculture can claim to have been successful with a species now critically
endangered in the wild. If aviculture was in the first place the reason for
birds being removed from the wild then it can now make amends by helping
them to go back. Probably less than forty birds now are left now in the wild.
There are very intensive management programmes in zoos in the UK, Europe
and the United State. Perhaps this is something that private aviculturists
should also think about, for which the Avicultural Society could take a leading

Quail &amp; Partridges in Captivity at Present
As some of you may know my particular love initially when I entered
aviculture was in fact Quail. I am now going to give you an illustrated slide
show on the Quail and Partridges available in aviculture today, not all of
these are however available in this country. I am fortunate to being able to
travel around the World and see these birds in their native environments as
well as in captivity. I would agree with Roger Wilkinson&apos;s comments that if
we are to see these birds in captivity in the future, steps will have to be taken
to ensure adequate breeding programmes are undertaken. In the case of
Quail in quite recent times you could buy them in pet shops. This no longer
applies. A very good example of this is the Rain Quail which comes from
India. During the 1950's/60's large numbers were imported and aviculturists
would have them in their aviaries. Little interest was taken in breeding this
bird.
In 1980 the Quail Group of the World Pheasant Association was formed,
with a view to bring together some of these species, which had all but died
out. The reason for this was the birds had at one time been very cheap, not
that easy to breed, easily replaceable, and the incentive had not been there.
Regrettably this incentive is usually financial, as has already been mentioned
earlier today.
Regarding the Rain Quail in 1980, we were able to trace a single male in
Shoeburyness, Essex, and this bird was at least fifteen years old. It wasn't
until last year that an aviculturist was able to bring in some Rain Quail from
the continent, where a small number had been located. One of the problems
today is still that Quail are relatively inexpensive, but the cost of transporting
the birds from their country or origin to this country far exceeds the value of
the birds. Another factor is that in their native countries there is often
legislation which prohibits the trapping and capture of Quail. The trappers
are encouraged to trap higher value birds. So we have a situation where
these highly desirable birds which live on our aviary floors are literally
dying out in aviculture. Unless we have specific breeding schemes, these
birds will go out of aviculture.
The Harlequin Quail comes from Africa. One of the contributions I
believe that aviculture can offer to ornithology is the observations made in
our aviaries. It has been suggested by Professor Tim Crow in South Africa
that the Asian Rain Quail and Harlequin Quail are taxonomically related.
Certainly, if this is proved to be correct, there will be a few eminent people
who have written extensively on the subject and they will be most put out.
The similarities are, size, coloration, display, size of egg, colour of egg, type
of nesting terrain etc. The scientists will take note and in fact do DNA
comparisons. At present Professor Tim Crow is undertaking this research.

The Stubble Quail is very similar to the Japanese Quail from Asia. It is
possible that there could be similarities between these two Quails. It is
possible that this came about when the continents broke up so perhaps the
Stubble Quail is a sub-species of the Japanese Quail, that you see in a lot of
aviaries today.
Regarding the North American Quail, these are bred in large quantities
in the Unites States and have been for a number of years. Again we have to
import these into this country, and this costs a lot of money. We have been
keeping these going now for several years, but even these are now beginning
to decline in numbers, therefore we have to import to maintain numbers.
The Scaled Quail was brought from the United States in 1983 where it is
endemic in the Southern States and Mexico. The birds brought into this
Country were in fact the Chestnut-bellied sub-species, and very few of the
Blue-scaled Quails actually came into this country. Regrettably the birds
have become mixed-up, as it is very difficult to distinguish the females of
the two sub-species.
In recent years the Mountain Quail has been imported, and I am delighted
to report that we are having success, although they are difficult birds to
keep. They are very susceptible to worms. Therefore most of the stock falls
foul to that contamination. They are best kept off the ground, in small
aviaries with sandy floors. It is best to describe their accommodation as
chicken hutches. They will reproduce, but with many of these birds they
only breed for up to three years, after which their chances of reproduction
are greatly reduced. Therefore, this greatly adds to the problem of
reproduction. Whereas a Parrot may live 50 years and reproduce for 30
years, with the Quail three to four years is good. You are faced with a
completely different approach to reproduction.
The Mearns Quail is regarded by myself as being one of the most difficult
small Quail that is available to aviculture. We had them in this country, but
we had a situation where they were reproducing only males. In the United
States they were fetching high prices approx. $400 per bird, and this for a
bird no bigger than a Song Thrush. We have bred them in this country but
it was only males. Most of the breeding is now done on the continent. I am
confident that there are only a few males left in this country.
The Brown Quail comes from the Far East. I am confident that it has
never been seen in this country. In size it is very close to the King Quail
better known in this country as the Chinese Painted Quail. There might be
some relationship there, but we are not certain.
We are sometimes asked what is the difference between. Partridge, Quail
and Francolin, and I cannot say. It seems to be a matter of terminology, and
even scientists cannot help us. The term, small game bird is probably a
good description.
The common Grey Partridge is found in this country. The Russians are
now starting to take these birds from the wild and are starting to bred them

as we breed our Grey Partridge. We have already seen some of these come
into Europe and some have been bred in Europe.
The Snow Partridge, is one of the rarest, coming from China. The Chinese
have just started to breed a few of these in captivity, but as far as we know,
none have come out of China. They are part of a captive breeding programme
that the Wild Life Department are undertaking. As with so many of these
birds, the Wild Life Departments in all countries are begging people and
governments to realise that they have got to do something about captive
breeding. You can't just let all the terrain be lost to various distractions.
They have got to really start thinking about a breeding programme albeit on
a very limited scale.
The Chukar Partridge used to be released into this country for shooting
but now it is restricted. They are beginning to die out as far as avicultural
birds are concerned.
The standard Red-legged Partridge which we have, is quite common in
the wild. They are being bred in large numbers as far as game birds are
concerned.
We now come to something which is a bit different. This is the Arabian
Chukar. I have just imported two pairs of these for San Diego Zoo, who in
turn have started a programme with the Breeding National Centre for captive
breeding in Tieve, Saudi Arabia, where they are trying to propagate these
species as an ongoing game bird. It is going to be very interesting to see the
sort of things we have to do with this one to get it going. It certainly is a lot
more difficult to breed the standard Red-legged Partridge. This is quite an
interesting bird in the aviary. It will run around and can become quite
aggressive. It is very large, it stands about 38cm high. It is not like the
normal Red-legged Partridge, but quite a character. The red bill stands out
and he has got big face tucks. When they become very excited their
brownish black crown comes up and they become quite aggressive. It is a
bit like a Palm Cockatoo.
The Barbary Partridge which is also related and found in Morocco, is
again a difficult species in this country although they breed. There are only
a few left and they are very susceptible to worms. Most people regrettably
have to keep them on wire.
The Philby's Rock Partridge has an overlapping range with the Arabian
Chukar. This is an Arabian species which has a similar coloration. Most of
these I am told are most difficult, as they require quite a dry environment
when their eggs are being incubated.
The Sand Partridge, is again not much bigger than a Thrush in size.
Not a lot of work has been done, but San Diego Zoo has been doing a lot of
work with them. However, at present they have not had too much success.
They then put them out to a private breeder, who has made quite an impression

on the stock. Hopefully we might see these in this country in larger numbers
in the future.
What is the difference between Francolin and Partridge? Being a complete
novice, I would say not a lot, because even the professionals can't agree
what one is to the other. The Crested Francolin has interesting features.
We had them in this country up and to about two or three years ago. Ivor
Burgess in Sleaford bred these, for the first time and he found they had very
interesting characteristics. Being a South African bird, the chicks did not
pick the egg, they burst the egg open, a bit like an Ostrich. Another question
that they pose is, "What are the relationships between terrain and climate
?" They certainly need quite low humidity for incubation.
The Swamp Partridge sometimes called the Swamp Francolin, has
recently become an endangered species as with so many of these tropical
species. Really we do not know a lot about them. We certainly have not
studied them in the wild, so there is a tremendous opportunity for individuals
who have these birds to study them in captivity. You will learn a lot from
them. They are great characters. There is a group of these being put together
in India at the present. They are found in elephant grass type terrain, so
they are not easy to see, but you can hear them pretty well. The have got a
good call voice. The locals will not go into the elephant grass because they
fear Tigers and other predatory animals. There is therefore a certain amount
of protection in their habitat from humans.
The Common-hill Partridge, is another one we brought in from Nepal.
We have been quite successful establishing them in this country, and in fact
(mentioning Dave Coles again) he has been breeding them on a regular
basis. They are parent reared in his Thrush aviaries at Childe Beale.
The Annamese Hill Partridge is a difficult species, I have found. I have
only ever bred them once, although Cliff Poney seems to breed them like
chickens. They are a very colourful species, but a tropical Partridge in that
sense. We have found that they will only really breed if they are in a fairly
warm high, humid atmosphere.
The Hainan Hill Partridge is one of a group of something like twelve Hill
Partridge of which quite a few are represented in captivity, but not in any
great extent. You have individual collections and Zoos concentrating on
them, but not really expanding the whole population.
The Sumatran Hill Partridge is an interesting story for me to tell you.
We brought these from the Continent as Sumatran Hill Partridge, and looked
through the various books and we didn't find a lot of information until
somebody came up with a theory, perhaps these Sumatran Hill Partridge,
were hybrids. As it happens I was able to talk to Ray Decker in Holland
who has quite a good collections of skins, and he said to go and look at the
Raffles collection in Singapore. We went to Singapore on holiday and sure

enough this in fact is the Sumatran Hill Partridge. It is pure and not a
hybrid. They have drawer after drawer of this particular species in their
collection. There is a sub-species which is found on the mainland of Malaysia
and in certain parts or Borneo. It is interesting how these birds have evolved.
I bred them first in 1990.
The Brown-breasted Hill Partridge really get us wound up over tropical
Partridges. It is found in various parts of South East Asia. We could not
hatch the eggs when they were laid in this country. Work was done at
Birdworld were we found that these eggs from this particular species need a
much more higher humidity in incubation than the Sumatran and the
Annamese. In fact the Sumatran need 55% the Annamese 50% and the
Brown-breasted Hill Partridge something like nearly 60%. When you look
at the distribution of this particular species, they are all intertwined. The
question is why in captivity, do these birds need different humidity for their
incubation?
The Red-billed Hill Partridge comes from Sumatra. It is at a breeding
station in Malaysia. These have been brought over from Sarba where they
are found. They hope to start a breeding programme as quite a lot of the
Wild Life People and the Malaysian people are beginning to realise what is
expected of them. I find it a most colourful bird. As far as I know it has
never been photographed in the wild. The few that have were all in captivity.
My interest in the Roulroul has extended over many years. It was probably
in the mid 1980's that I had my first pair. I couldn't get them to breed. So
I sought some advice from John Mallet at Jersey Zoo who seemed to be
breeding them quite well. He said to increase the temperature to 70*F and
see that they are sprayed regularly. I put a mist spray over the top of them,
and increased the humidity in a special aviary enclosed in order to get the
temperature up. In two weeks I had a nest. The female goes into her nest
and literally pulls all the debris around her and whilst she is in there sitting,
you cannot actually see her. Contrary to all this I have seen hens in an open
nest. Any theory about building dome nests doesn't appear to be correct.
For those who want to breed Roulroul I would certainly say you must increase
the temperature and humidity and they will go down to nest very quickly.
The Black Wood Partridge is in captivity in a number of collections in
South East Asia I don't think they have actually been bred in this country.
Certainly I had them for about 5 years. We had eggs and that is as far as it
ever went. They are very hard to keep from the point of view of settling
down, as they are very flighty.
The Long-billed Wood Partridge is probably one of the brightness birds
which I was able to film in Jurong Bird Park. Suddenly the bird appeared
from the undergrowth, and I shot it! There is also the Ferruginous Wood
Partridge which we have had them in this country. Winged World at Heysham
had them nest but were not successful.

The Crimson-headed Partridge, is a quite spectacular bird. It is bigger
than a Roulroul, and they overlap in South East Asia. They are in fact
breeding it in some of the Wild Life Parks. A number have been shipped to
the United States, in particular the Bronx Zoo. They held back 12 pairs in
Bronx Zoo trying to get them to bred. It is an interesting bird, very colourful,
certainly colourful when the light catches that iridescent head.
The Spot-winged Wood Quail, come from South America. We don't
know a lot about the South American Quail. Various skins have been
brought and illustrations produced, but in reality we don't know much about
them at all. Again is it a Quail or a Partridge? It is a Quail I believe and it
is quite a large bird.
The Buffy-crowned Tree Partridge is now being bred successfully in
Costa Rica. We are very hopeful that they are coming over here to us.
The Black Francolin is another bird in our aviaries as is the Madagascar
Partridge. Work has been done by Tim Crow. We have samples of tissue,
and there is a direct link between the Madagascar and the Black Francolin
as a related species. So that is some success. Up to that time science had not
indicated at all that they were connected. They have done DNA profiling.
Roger Wilkinson knows more about this than I do. He has met C.J. Sibley
who is said to be the man of the subject.

Photographing Birds
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974432" page_id="56270710"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
It was in April that Ken Lawrence asked if I would give a talk about my
experiences in photographing birds. I was quick to explain that I am not an
expert on birds, I am only a photographer.
I decided to use the Kingfisher as my logo symbol, after one had taken
the goldfish from my pond. Why do we need good pictures of birds? We
need them for books, brochures, posters and for slide shows such as this.
Many private bird owners require good pictures of their birds for sentimental
reasons. Birds can be photographed in aviaries, against the wire or in front
of a nesting box. These pictures of the birds can be excellent. But a much
better result is achieved it is taken in my box.
Some 23 years ago, I started experimenting with the idea of making up a
special photographic box. In order to make it work, I would need to make
fairly large colour prints of suitable backgrounds. These backgrounds would
need to be evenly lit from each corner, hence 4 flash guns to start with. The
flash on the birds would need to be soft, positioned in front and above.
The plumage of the birds must be good because a Nikon 105mm macro
lens will resolve the finest detail, on a fairly slow colour transparency film.
Some birds look good on their branches, surrounded with contrasting
autumnal leaves. I think a simple sky background looks good for some
birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.997441395348837" page_id="56270711"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
The backgrounds I make myself. The large prints are made from a 6 x 9
cm colour negative. To enlarge and process one of these, a colour lab would
charge about #40, and that does not include the actual going out into the
countryside to find the right kind of backgrounds and taking the picture. So
you see, they are not cheap. When I have used the backgrounds a few times,
I make new ones.
I must admit Tanagers are one of my favourite species. At present, I
have taken about 40 varieties. Some birds such as Sunbirds, are naturally
dark in colour. In order to show the beautiful metallic sheen, I increase the
power of my front flash. If I do not increase the flash, a Copper Sunbird
would photograph almost black.
As you can imagine, it is not easy to take good groups of birds. When
Mike Fidler wanted a cover picture of Gouldian Finches for his and Stewart
Evan's book, I knew we had a problem. He wanted an upright format with
the birds nicely spaced and all looking to the front. We decided to use a
branch at about 45 degrees and space had to be left for the title of the book.
In the end Mike had to hold a branch and with lots of luck we got 4 shots.
Many photographs have to be planned well in advance and may call for
a special background. A cock Bearded Reedling would look nice against a
water background (as seen on the Norfolk Boards). You would use foliage
on which these birds would naturally feed. You may say that this is cheating,
maybe it is, but I never claim that all my pictures are taken outside. I am out
to produce a good representation of a bird in a natural-looking environment.
Plus the fact that it is often raining outside. Woodpeckers require a suitable
tree trunk. I searched and found one at a timber yard. My workshop is full
of similar pieces of timber and branches. A Wheatear would look good
against a loose boulder background. There is no limit to what can be done
under controlled conditions, given the time. Many parts of TV wildlife
programmes are made this way. A beautiful mossy log just screams for a
little Woodmouse, all carefully planned beforehand. All the very small
mammals photographed in my box have been returned to the very place they
were caught. Pale birds require less exposure in order to hold highlight
detail.
For many educational and scientific purposes, we need good sharp slides
to show comparisons. At times I have to change my photographic technique.
I have a "canary/budgie" box. It is smaller and was designed to allow the
normal wire cage front to be dropped down. The use of a blue background
gives the ideal contrast.
Type canaries are very difficult to photograph. One has to get the bird at
its correct stance. When the wire front is lowered, the bird gets confused,
but Editors like pictures without wires.
When photographing winning birds at exhibitions, no bird must be
handled. Therefore, I designed a system which allows the birds to hop into

my photographic box and after the pictures have been taken, the bird happily
hops back into its own showcage. Recently, when working in Germany and
photographing delicate Frill Canaries, as the birds were returned to their
showcages, there was a murmuring from the owner of "Ach Wunderbar das
ist schoen!"
I would like to deviate for a moment and discuss title slides such as one
might require for a talk such as this. Lf normal typewriter text is photographed,
it may be too fine and illegible to be visible at the back of a large hall. Also,
it will show any dust and dirt. Use a bold typeface. This can be typed on a
modern word processor. The text can be photographed with a 35mm camera
with a 105mm macro lens using a special Lith type film. The resulting high
contrast negative can be used. But you may wish to have a blue diazo contact
slide made from the Lith negative. Bear in mind a 35mm camera has a 2 x
3 proportion format so have your bold type set to fill that area, either landscape
or upright format.
Maps may help to make a talk more interesting. You can use a political
map (if country names are up-to-date) or a physical map. Finally you may
wish to go in close and give detail of the actual area where the birds are
found. I must warn you of a copyright on maps etc. If in doubt, approach
the publisher and explain why you wish to use a certain map. Generally, it
is only to show an audience, there may be no problem. Many people copy
maps - even I do and I do not ask permission. But your have been warned!
The owner of a bird telephoned to say that she had an unusual bird. She
wanted photographs and could I help. Naturally, I said yes - but the owner
did not want any publicity. The photos turned out okay and the lady was
given free slides. The results laid in my library for well over a year, then a
telephone call told me that the bird had died and that I could now use the
slides for publication. This kind of thing happens often, where the owners
have trusted me to keep their secret quiet. Slides are never used without
owner's permission.
We hear so much of bird thefts. Have you ever thought of using detailed
pictures of your valuable birds as means of picking out a stolen bird ? Take
for instance a Toucanet. Unusual marks on its beak could identify a stolen
bird. A bird who has lost some toes and/or has a crossed beak. These
features could easily identify a stolen bird.
Hummingbirds in flight call for a special technique. In order to freeze
the fast moving wings, the speed of the flash must be in the duration of a 1/
6000th of a second (or shorter). But there is a snag. When you reduce the
duration of your flash, you also, lose power and may have to use a much
faster film, together with the problem of grain, or use of large lens aperture
and lose depth of field. Even when some pictures have been taken, you will
not know if the wings of the bird have covered the beak and face of the bird
until the film is processed.

As with all birds photographed under controlled conditions, very great
care must be taken to avoid stress because of the often great value of each
bird. With Hummingbirds, they have to be allowed to feed, or they become
torpid.
There are some cases where I do not wish to handle birds. Perhaps I'd
better explain how I work. As I do not use glass in the aperture through
which I point my camera (for fear of injury to the birds) I always like to work
in a darkened room.
Once a lady left me to photograph her pair of Green-naped Lorikeets and
said, "When you have finished, grab them from the back". After taking
some good pictures, I did just this. In the very dim light, the first bird got
his beak into a fleshy part of my hand. Amid screams from me, I could feel
the blood trickling down my elbow Please do not laugh, I didn't. On the
way home with my hand bandaged, I swore this would not happen again.
So, back to the design and now I have a special catching box which fits
onto my photographic box, and, by a simple method of turning certain lights
out and certain lights on, there is no chance of getting bitten but, what is
more important, the birds are not put under any stress.
For a recent book that I helped on, many maps had to be drawn. This I
enjoyed doing as, during the last war, I had spent five years in the Middle
East with a R.E. Survey unit drawing maps for RAF bombing raids. Then
there was the question of showing the underwing colours of 12 different
Rainbow Lorikeets. Some of the birds were not in this country, so reference
had to be obtained from skins etc. Probably because I had not used my
designer skills for a long time, this particular drawing took at least 100
hours to complete, and will be one page of a book. The majority of the
pictures will be from colour slides.
Finally having taken our colour slides, do we know how long they will
retain these saturated colours ? Kodachrome is about 25 years. All E-6
processed films such as most of the ones that I have been showing today,
would be less. Normal colour prints (made from colour negatives) will fade
in strong sunlight in a matter of weeks. If you have a good colour transparency,
I suggest you have a Cibachrome Print made from it. (They are not supposed
to fade, the dyes being Diazos).
This was the most difficult talk to reproduce as Dennis showed 77 slides
to illustrate the points he was talking about.

Aviary Constructions and Birds at Cobham
This talk is about some of the ideas that have been used in the construction
and planting of the aviaries at Cobham. I will be making references to a
few of the birds kept and bred in them over the last 20 years. For those of
you who don't know the construction at Cobham has taken many years.
Those of you who came in 1976 when we held the first garden party for the
Society and have regularly attended since will be aware of the gradual increase
in the numbers and varieties of aviaries.
Whenever possible we try to make aviary frames "light" by using gas
tubing. The gas tubing is cemented into the ground. We use ordinary
galvanised netting most of the time and this is painted black using Finnigans
Hammerite paint. It is applied straight on with a brush. It appears to have
no ill effects to the birds. I strongly believe that all aviary wire ought to be
black. When I first started working for the London Parks their aviaries were
silver and it is awful to view the birds this way.
In all of our larger aviaries we try to incorporate a garden in the front so
that it blends in and you lose the wire netting. The netting varies in size, but
it is usually 12mm or 19mm but it is not welded mesh. On some flights we
have used nylon netting which can be purchased pre-cut to your particular
requirements, but this is only for the roof. The sides are in ordinary wire
netting. One of the aviaries has had it for 18 years and it has been successful.
It also helps when there is snow. We use angular sections of gas tubing to
provide extra support to the roof. Key clamps are very easy. The nylon
netting is 12mm and is black. There are two drawbacks that may occur and
we have had neither. If you have rats or squirrels, both could eat through the
nylon netting. Despite being in the country we don't have squirrels and we
are always on the lookout for rats, mice etc., and take precautions. You must
never let your guard down.
By landscaping your aviary you gently enhance its appeal. Hopefully the
birds will like it. With lawns we cut them and this greatly surprises people.
They are cut with a mower and the birds will just sit there. If we take our
main breeding pair of Black-winged Stilts they rear 4 young each year. You
can go by them with your mower and they just sit there on their eggs. Not all
our Waders are so good so you have to be careful. When nesting the Black-
winged Stilts can have no other Waders in their aviary. They become very
aggressive and when we had our old Scarlet Cock of the Rock they would fly
up and attack him as he was on his perch.
Coming on to ponds, we always have the water just running because if
you don't you are likely to get feather problems. This has certainly been the
case with lots of other people. What happens is that in still water an oily
film builds up and when you have birds, in particular Waders, this is
transferred onto their feathers, and then you get feather problems. You only

need to keep the water moving slowly and you will be spared of these
problems. At Cobham we therefore have no still water ponds. We use shingle
or silver sand for the bases of our streams were appropriate.
If you can put in a waterfall the birds will love it. When we turn the
pumps on in the morning, the birds are immediately down to it whether to
drink of to bath and it is only the same recycled water. This applies to all
birds from Pheasants to Hummingbirds. Our White-capped Redstarts love
it. There are a series of pumps at Cobham either for the waterfalls of just
recycling the pond waters.
Waders will insist on taking their food into the water and washing it. As
those of you who have visited Cobham know in one of the ponds we keep
Koi Carp with no problems at all. Most of the ponds are about 30cms deep
with gentle sloping slides. You must never build a pond against the side of
your aviary because if there is a night fright the birds may get disturbed and
fly against the wires and perhaps drown in the pond. If you have a plate
glass window like one of our famous Bird Gardens of the past, the birds
stand no chance at all and would crash into the glass and fall into the pond.
Water lilies look very attractive on a pond and are particularly appreciated
by our pair of South American Jacana. I am delighted to tell you that we
have bred 4 this year. It may perhaps be a world first breeding, certainly for
this country. The cock does all of the work. He builds the nest, does all the
incubation, feeds the chicks are rears them. The hen only lays the eggs!
When they hatch, they are like bumble bees, very small indeed. The cock
would carry them about tucked into his feathers. We are very worried that
there might be thunderstorms during this period but there were none.
Having a waterfall means large rocks and this again helps to breakdown
the background. Rocks should be the first thing that you put in for obvious
reasons. You would put a waterfall towards the back of your aviary with the
water running into your pond in the centre. Every so often cleaning of the
ponds may be required. Generally the water will not freeze in winter as
most Waders will stand in at night. Water does attract insects in summer
and these are eagerly consumed by our birds.
For those who can remember our original aviaries looked very spacious
with their plants, but 20 years on things have changed. It is a continual
battle trying to keep the vegetation in check. As an example dwarf conifers
have had to be removed when they grew up 4m high. Of the original five
aviary units the back two resemble a forest. The birds may like it but there
are several problems. It is not pleasant on your eye when viewing. It is very
difficult to check that all the birds are fit and healthy. Should there be one
that need medical attention it is very difficult to catch as is any bird that is
being constantly harassed. I would, like to point out that several deaths are
due to aggression between various birds, even pairs. This can lead to death
by fighting or just stress.

Now for a few tips on plants that my help you. Pyracantha is a good
plant for aviaries. We have tried Maples but they are impossible in an aviary
with finches etc., as the birds will go for the buds. Conifers on the whole are
good, but you need to keep some of them under control. It is amazing how
some plants grow much better than others. Cotoneaster is much appreciated
as the birds will take the berries when ready. Russian Vine is a steady grower
and will attract live food. Balls Golden Sage and Variegated Grass are used
a lot. Our Yews have grown very well. In one aviary, they are spoiling the
rock landscape. Heathers have been found to be very good. Palms can be
successful but care must be taken. An expert on Palms told me that they
would be all right, but some &apos;'melted" in the first cold winter we had after
having them.
The Phormiums are excellent growers but you may have a problem with
a bird getting caught in them. The Monkey Puzzle Tree is eye-catching, but
needs attention every year to keep it under control. Fig trees have proved
ideal and highly recommend them. Red Hot Pokers look lovely and are
much appreciated and used by nectar feeders like Sunbirds.
Obviously in a planted landscaped aviary your birds have a great variety
of perching to choose from. Some birds like a firm perch others a springy
perch. Some like small and other like large perches. For roosting, a bush is
often appreciated.
Some perching birds nest naturally in a bush or on a ledge whereas other
require an artificial nesting site. In a large aviary you need to have plenty of
potential nesting sites for the various types of birds that you have in it. If
there are not adequate sites competition may occur which may lead to even
death. Emerald Starlings were one of the numerous first breedings and they
use a nest box. They are one of my favourite birds, and on a sunny day there
are few birds to match their beauty. Incidentally, they do not make good
show birds, as they have a tendency to stay on the floor of their cage and
generally they are nervous in a confined space.
White-breasted Crake are a particularly vicious bird. Although spending
a lot of time on the floor in company with Waders they love climbing in trees
and bushes. They roost at night sometimes as high as they can. They are
very difficult to sex and don't take kindly to surgical sexing. They nest high
up sometimes in an open fronted Finch type next box. We had an unfortunate
experience when we introduced some new ones into our flock. Six of the
new ones were killed by one of the residents in a single night.
Jungle Fowl and a planted aviary are not a good combination as they
destroy the plants. This can apply to several species of Pheasants and
Tragopans as their larger feet can turn the grass to mud at times. Satyr
Tragopans breed in one of our paddock aviaries where the Cedar Tree has
grown out of control through the roof. This greatly distracts the pleasant
view that there ought to be. These paddock aviaries have wooden backs and

have open fronted shelters. They are ideal for Choughs, Azure-winged
Magpies, Pheasants etc. They are constructed of 50mm square timber with
artificial perching. There is trellis work at the rear. The aviaries face north
so they don't get much sun. At one time Cranes where kept in this paddock
but when it was windy they took off and could get over the 2m high fence.
We therefore put up some netting and planted some trees which now are
reaching maturity.
There is a particular Yew Tree in the grounds and we have put a Macaw
aviary around it. We have put weld mesh around this Yew Tree and the
Macaws keep it beautifully trimmed. The Yew has given us no problems but
many books advise against this as the Yew is poisonous.
Keas have bred for us numerous times over the years. My friend, the late
Sidney Porter, achieved the first breeding in 1946 when he lived at Derby.
He had a big garden but had houses quite near so his neighbours kept
complaining regarding their extraordinary noise. We have two young this
year but ours are not as noisy as Sidney's were. Another unusual breeding
this year was the Masked Lapwing, which bred with snow on the ground.
The hen just sat there. Luckily the snow melted quickly. We were the first
people to breed this bird in this country.
There are a range of six small flights for tropical species that need heat.
We used polycarbonate triple thickness for the roof which helps keep the
heat in, allows light in and you don't need wire with it. It also doesn't get
dirty. It keeps very clean and doesn't shatter. There is a corridor with doors
at either end which are open all day in summer to aid ventilation. It does
tend to get rather hot at times in the summer. Our cactus house has a similar
roof with a glass fronted sliding aluminium door. Talking of the cactus
house reminds me of our Crocodile Birds. It is said that you need 120 * F in
the sand for the eggs to hatch. Perhaps heat panels could be tried providing
you could induce the birds to lay.
Another couple of aviaries have been built using 75mm square timber.
The timber is not cemented into the ground, unlike the gas tubing. The
aviary's roof is square pipe, welded with a rise so that if we get any heavy
snow it will spring and not give. So far we have been lucky. There is nylon
netting on top which means that it doesn't look too "heavy".
One particular bird that we have had for years is a male Purple-throated
Fruitcrow. We had two but never obtained a female. I remember John
Yealland paying #7 for one when I paid #7 for a Hummingbird.
Several of our shelters at Cobham are block built but there are wooden
ones as well. Most of them are heated so that the birds can go in at night.
But they do like sleeping outside and in a large flight it is unwise to try to
put them in. Hummingbirds roosting outside get nectar first thing even in
freezing conditions which we don't get very often in Surrey.

One tragedy this year was over our hen White-breasted Kingfisher that
came out of her nesting burrow at night, when egg bound, and fell into the
pond in her aviary.
Finally mention must be made of the Rothschild&apos;s Grackle which we
have bred in the past at Cobham. I remember them attacking our Temminck&apos;s
Stilts and killing one of them. They seemed to take it out on our Waders but
not on other birds.

Referring back to Raymond&apos;s earlier talk, the Chairman asked him to
say a few things on John Yealland, who was one time our Editor and curator
of birds at London Zoo.
"John Yealland was a great friend of mine who started off as a young
man with the Marquess of Tavistock. John's father was already working
there but he died soon after and John took over even though he was perhaps
still a teenager. He was very efficient. He then went abroad to the continent
were he was responsible for some very big collections. He worked for
Derscheids who were famous aviculturists in Belgium until the war when he
had to escape quickly or be captured. As you all know poor Jean Derscheid
was tortured through the war and he was shot for helping British troops to
escape out of Belgium. When John came back here to England, before I
joined the Society, he went with Gerald Durrell to West Africa to collect
birds. John then went to Slimbridge. I remember Jean Delacour telling me
that he went to Slimbridge with Peter Scott and Dr Hindle to look at what
they thought of it as a site for the Wildfowl Trust and John Yealland was
made curator. He was really responsible for starting the Ne-ne Geese. He
went to Hawaii and brought back the eggs and reared the ducks. He was a
very quiet person but he was brilliant really. He then left Slimbridge and
came to London Zoo, in the early 1950's as curator of birds where he stayed
until he retired".
The Chairman then stated that whereas there is a wealth of information
on Jean Delacour, there is nothing on John Yealland in the magazine. Roger
Wilkinson agreed with this and said that there were other as well who deserve
recognition. The Chairman also mentioned David Attenborough and Sir
Peter Scott who Raymond knew in those early years. The Chairman said
that as a young man he had met Wilfred Frost at London Zoo were he had
Wilson's Birds of Paradise for sale at #75 each, a large sum in those days.
Raymond added that the Greater Bird of Paradise was #125.00.
The Chairman concluded by thanking all the speakers. He said that it is
important that those famous aviculturists from the past are remembered in
the Avicultural Magazine as well as present members. He pointed out that
Bristol Zoo had at one time a large collection of Cranes. The talk on Chester
Zoo brought back memories to him as he had worked there for a time as a
young man. He agreed with Roger Wilkinson that breeding programmes
are essential as first breedings are a great thrill, but sustained reproduction

must be the aim of us all. Perhaps fewer species will be kept in the future.
The talk on Quail was most interesting, as it is a group that is taken for
granted unlike Parrots which receive a great deal of attention. If we cannot
keep birds, then we can all appreciate good photography. And finally giving
attention to detail in housing and accommodation can result in excellent
breeding results as has been achieved at Cobham.
With a final round of applause for Andrew Richards, who had worked
the projector for the slides, the day's session was concluded.
Saturday evening, members and guests reassembled at Bristol Zoo for a
sherry reception in the restaurant. Some members and their guests attended
the Centenary celebrations for the first time having had to work during the
day, or had travelled a long distance to attend. The Avicultural Society was
honoured that the Lord Mayor of Bristol was able to attend. Those present
numbering about 90 then moved up the stairs into the Clifton Suite of the
Pavilion for the Centenary Celebrations Dinner. There was a delicious 3
course dinner including a carved buffet. There followed the usual toasts and
speeches. Messages received from the other societies were also read out.
During these a presentation was made to our Society&apos;s President Miss
Ruth Ezra by one of our vice-presidents Ken Dolton. It was a glass bowl
engraved with a Galah, Scarlet Cock of the Rock, Egret, Diamond Sparrow,
Rothschild's Grackle, 2 Hummingbirds and a Greater Bird of Paradise. It
was a token of appreciation by the members of the Avicultural Society for
all the help, encouragement and kindness given by Miss Ezra, over a great
many years. Incidentally she is the only our ninth President in 100 years
and as you all know her father, Alfred Ezra, O.B.E., was our President at the
time of the Diamond Jubilee in 1954.
After the dinner members and their guests were able to enjoy each other&apos;s
company in a most delightful and relaxed setting.
Sunday morning saw members re-assembling at the Zoo for a conducted
tour. Bristol Zoo is set in a beautiful twelve acre garden in the heart of Clifton.
West Country people are proud of 'their' Zoo. Sunday was a warm autumn day
and amongst the birds we were able to view Nicobar Pigeons, Luzon Bleeding
Heart Doves, Keas, Royal and Grosbeak Starlings, Rothschild's Mynah, Toco
Toucan, Yellow-throated Laughing Thrushes to name but a few. The Gardens,
as always were a joy to view.
Around lunchtime it was off to the Tropical Bird Gardens, at Rode where
we were greeted by Betty Risdon, Mike and Norma Curzon and their keepers.
Here we learnt that a single Red-tailed Amazon Parrot had been reared by
its parents. This appears to be a UK first breeding. (See page 49 of this
year's 2nd issue for a detailed report).
All too soon it was time to say our farewells and the highly successful
Centenary Celebrations were over.

In 1988, a hand rearing protocol for the Red Bird Of Paradise Paradisaea
rubra was established at the Bronx Zoo/Wildlife Conservation Park (BZ/
WCP (Worth et al 1991). Since then, we have successfully hand reared 26
Red and 12 Lesser Birds of Paradise. Periodic attempts at allowing for a
parent reared bird had however, resulted in chick abuse or infanticide
subsequent to the moment of hatch. In 1995 we had our first successfully
parent reared Lesser Birds of Paradise in the propagation facility.

An off-site facility. Prop 1 has been modified through the years to
accommodate the breeding requirements of Birds of Paradise. The classic
lek mating system involves males gathering to perform elaborate courtship
displays in communal arenas, with females visiting to select a mate (Emlen
and Oring 1977). Our artificial lek comprises individual males in adjacent
cages and individual females who are introduced into those cages with male
access to female nest cages restricted. Detailed management techniques are
outlined in the AAZPA Annual Proceedings (Hundgen et al 1990).
Paradisaea minor
Native to the lowland forest of north-western New Guinea (Gilliard 1969,
Cooper and Forshaw 1977), the Lesser Bird of Paradise is a polygamous
species that exhibits extreme sexual dimorphism (LeCroy 1981). Choosing
a site away from the lek, the cryptically coloured females are solely responsible
for nest building, incubation, and rearing of the young (Beehler 1986). Their
nest is a flimsy cup-shaped structure of twigs, covered externally with dead
leaves, placed 6m or more above the ground in a slender tree (Coates 1990).
They lay one egg per clutch, cream coloured and streaked with longitudinal
brown patches. In their native tropical zone, breeding follows the rainy
season from June though to October. At our Zoo in the Northern hemisphere
(with an adjusted photo period of 12 hours, at an average building temperature
of 21 degrees C (70 degrees F), they breed from November through to April.
History of the Breeding Female at BZ/WCP
We acquired this wild caught bird, a presumed juvenile, in February
1989 and began introducing her to males that October. There are 2 fully
plumed adult males to whom she has been alternately introduced, and showing
no preference for one (which is often the case at a natural lek, Beehler 1983),
has reliably bred with both. She laid her first egg in February 1991 and
incubated for 14 days, after which we pulled the egg and hand reared the
chick. By these means she produced eight more chicks in the following

three seasons. In March 1994, we let her hatch a chick, and it survived 12
days. The subsequent two eggs of that season were infertile (the males having
gone into moult), and she did not lay again until October 1994.
Modification of Nest Cage
It was suspected the loss of the March 1994 chick was due to the
disturbance of the female by the proximity of other Birds of Paradise.
Observations of nest sites in the wild have indicated a lack of tolerance by
female Birds of Paradise for conspecifics in the same area (Clifford Firth,
pers comm.) With the intention of further isolating this female, the following
season we removed the birds directly adjacent to her nesting cage, and
partially blocked the view of another female two cages away. Two males
were across the service alley (fig. 1.). _

<bodyText confidence="0.985900235294118" page_id="56270722"  page_num="195" year="" vol="">
As in previous seasons, the female nested in a wood box (33xllx9cm
with an 18cm opening) 2.7m off the ground (just below the ceiling). She
constructed a cup nest of curtain vine and palm fibre that met the lip of the
box, with 7.5cm of oak leaves and shredded cypress bark beneath it.
To ensure survival, the first two chicks of the season were pulled (laid 15
October and 3rd December 1994), and the chicks hand reared in the brooder
room. (The nest was torn down by the female after each egg was pulled, and
rebuilt in a similar fashion). On January 3rd, 1995, the female laid a third
egg, and was given the opportunity to rear the chick.
We modified another management variable by minimising bird/keeper
presence in the nest cage at the same time. During incubation the female
was offered access to an adjoining outside yard, and quickly trained to shift
outside while her cage was cleaned and the nest checked. (The mildness of
the winter allowed this, and average time spent outside was 2-3 minutes).
Food
The basic diet of the adult Birds of Paradise consists of a low iron pellet
(Zeigler Bird food), and mixed fruit salad. Mealworms (beetle larvae) or

crickets are offered as treats. The basic diet of hand reared chicks (fed
approximately every two hours from 6am - 4pm) for the first 2 weeks, consist
primarily of cut up pinky mice. On the 14th day of incubation, extra insects,
waxworms and mealworms, and cut up pinky mice were added to the female's
food pan.
The chick hatched on the 18th day (January 21st), the female depositing
the shell in a back corner of the cage. Fresh pans were given at 6am, 8, 10,
12, 2, and 4pm.
Food items (in general order consumed by the female), included large
mealworms, waxworms, mealworm pupae, small mealworms, whole grape,
pinky pieces, crickets, cut grapes, blueberries, egg whites, apple, and Bird of
Paradise pellets. Occasionally beetles and walking stick insects were offered.
It was unclear what the female fed the chick in the nest. After fledging,
it was observed the fruit, waxworms and mealworms made up the bulk of the
diet (fed by regurgitation), though a wild caught field mouse was also fed to
the chick 21 days after hatch.
Behaviour of Female Towards Fledging
The chick fledged 18 days after hatching (8th February), and weighed 90
grams. One day prior, the female had become very active, showing specific
agitation (by way of a distinct guttural growl) towards the female two cages
away, and to the males when they would come in to view. Blinds were put
up, and virtually all visual access to other birds was cut off.
The day after the chick fledged, the female threw the nest out of the box
and attended the chick (who was not quite ready to fly), on the ground.
Between feeding and preening the chick, she displayed the sporadic behaviour
of gently pinching its head, and pulling at its legs and toes.
Though fully feathered and flying perch to perch by day 25, the chick did
not go near the food pan, and at 40 days was still dependant on the female
for food. She had begun to show interest in the males again (by attempts to
see them, soft vocalisations, and consistent perching on, or near the
introduction door). The toe tugging became increasingly aggressive over
this time, and culminated in an apparent attack which resulted in the removal
of the chick on 4th March (at 42 days).

Introduction to one of the males began on 8th March, with the female
immediately soliciting copulation. Three days later she had built a new
nest. Copulation was observed on the 12th and 15th of March. The male
began moulting on the 18th, the female would not shift for introduction on
the 19th, and she laid an egg on the 20th.
As with the first chick, this chick was hatched 18 days later (7th April),
and fledged 18 days after that. Its weight was 70 grams. Once again the
female was observed tugging its leg, and the chick was moved to an adjacent
cage on day 19 (marked 2A in Fig 1.).

Within a day the chick began accepting hand feeds from the keeper. It
continued begging to the female however, who in turn tried feeding it through
the screen of the cage. The test of letting female into chick&apos;s cage had
interesting results.
While inside the chicks cage, the keeper opened a shift door. The female
came into the cage and began feeding the chick. Within minutes (it seemed
to correlate with being unable to evoke any further gape response), she began
pinching the chicks&apos; head and tugging at its leg.
Appearing not to be bothered by the proximity of the keeper (1 m. away),
the female allowed herself to be shifted out of the cage.
These "supervised visits", continued as the chick begged, or about every
hour and a half. Because the female fed primarily fruit and worms to the
chick, and its weight was lower than that of the first chick&apos;s, hand feeds of
pink pieces were supplemented by the keeper.
"Co-rearing" by female parent and keeper continued for 10 more days
until, with encouragement, this chick was eating on its own at 28 days.
Chick Weight and Gender: Hand Reared vs. Parent Reared
Figure 2 compares the average daily weight gain of 7 hand reared male
Lesser Bird of Paradise chicks and 4 hand reared females (from hatch to day
50). The 3rd line represents the average daily weight gain of the parent
reared chicks (from day 18 to day 50), and most closely corresponds to the
weights of hand reared females. Eventual blood feather sexing determined
both parent reared chicks to be female.
Additional Notes
Though still not eating on her own at 42 days, it took keepers just two
days to encourage the first chick to eat independently. Comparatively, hand
reared Lesser Birds of Paradise require more time and much more
encouragement to eat independently (24 - 28 days) than hand reared Red
Birds of Paradise (17-21 days), (Cooper P pers. observ. and unpublished
data BZ/WCP).

Communication with field researchers provided ideas for modifying cage
variables as well as trying to understand the needs and behaviour of a nesting
female Bird of Paradise. Isolating our female may have been a key to this
success. It should be considered too, that once fledged and in the confinement
of a cage, the chick becomes a conspecific in the nesting area. If perceived
as such by the female, this may account for the aggression towards it.
Exploring this principle, the nesting cages of the other breeding females
have been further spaced apart for next season, and visual access can be
eliminated. An empty cage has been made available next to each nesting
cage that will serve as neutral territory during introductions, and can provide
sanctuary for a fledging if need be.

The keepers of British Softbills suffered more than any other aviculturists
when the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 became law. Up until then
many fanciers kept collections of Softbills and practised the difficult art to
keeping them in excellent condition. Every top Softbill show team in the
land contained a Redstart Cock; the supreme showman.
The uninitiated could be forgiven for thinking that a Redstart is a Foreign
Softbill, so striking is its coloration. Its black throat and face contrasts with
its white forehead. Its blue and grey upper parts are the perfect foil for its
orange-red underparts. The orange-red tail vibrates constantly with an excited
up-and-down movement further enhancing the showmanship.
After the 1981 Act, only seven Softbills remained on the list of those
which can be exhibited and four of these are designated pest species. The
seven are the Magpie, Jay, Jackdaw, Starling, Dunnock, Blackbird and Song
Thrush. The Redstart was a great loss to the show bench. The British Bird
Council&apos;s (B.B.C.) breeding programme is aimed at helping experienced
fanciers to breed Redstarts, with the intention of increasing their numbers
to such an extent that they will be permitted to be exhibited once more.
Understandably, Redstart breeding slumped dramatically as an initial reaction
to the Act, but it is pleasing to report that the number being bred in captivity
has increased greatly since the programme was instituted.
No one would pretend that the Redstart is an easy subject to breed. The
facts that the species is migratory and, under normal circumstances, produces
only one round of eggs add to the difficulties. Providing sufficient livefood
of the required type to support the chicks for the first few days is a constant
problem. Special measures need to be taken if Redstarts are to be prevented
from falling into a moult as soon as they are introduced into the breeding
aviary. For this reason, winter management takes on increased importance.
In nature. Redstarts would spend their winter in Africa and enjoy longer
day lengths than those available in the British Isles. This means that the use
of artificial light is beneficial, but only enough - say IV 2 hours a day - to
increase the opportunities to feed. Lengthening the day to an apparent 14
hours would be counterproductive, in that it could very well bring on a moult.
Just enough heating is supplied to prevent the drinking water from freezing.
Draughtproof quarters are essential. Preparation needs to be made for the
day, in early April, when the cock and hen will be introduced to each other.
An unplanned introduction can result in one partner killing the other.
I have been taught the value of a gradual introduction - both of one bird
to the other and of the birds into the outside aviary. My Redstarts spend the
winter in inside flights or flight cages, with cocks separated from hens. From
early March onwards, as long as the weather is dry and mild, they are put

individually into single breeder cages and placed in a sheltered part of the
outside flight for two hours in the middle of the day. This task is undertaken
by my wife. This gradual exposure to the elements hardens off the feathering
and goes a long way to preventing a moult which would upset the pattern of
breeding. The cages are located so that cocks and hens can see each other; a
preparation that reduces the risk of fighting. Once paired the sexes will live
peacefully together until September, when they need to be separated once
more.
The bigger the flight, the easier it is to breed Redstarts. This is not just
because Softbills are very active and more space gives the opportunity for
one bird to hide from another, but also because more livefood is attracted to
the greater number of plants that a large flight can contain. In my
establishment, a fully planted 12.2m x 3.6m aviary houses one breeding pair
of Redstarts, plus two pairs of other British Birds. I have found that the
livefood offered by the breeder plays little or no part in the initial feeding of
the chicks. During the first few days the parents cannot collect enough of
the tiny winged insects, minute caterpillars and even crustaceans that are
almost invisible to the naked eye.
My aviaries contain a very wide selection of plants or shrubs. Four
Honeysuckles attract masses of valuable aphids, though they also attract
blackfly, which my Redstarts seem to ignore. Hops are valuable in a planted
aviary because they are self clinging and look after themselves. Russian
Vine is popular with some breeders, but I feel that it is so dense that it is not
the best plant to bring insects into range of the birds. Buffalo worms and
mini-mealworms are always made available.
One of the problems of leaving the parent birds to collect their own wild
livefood is that a change of weather can affect its availability. It takes only a
rainstorm or a drop in temperature to make buds close more tightly and so
make livefood less accessible. Every possible device must be used to increase
the quantity and quality of livefood. The floors of my flights are layered
with leaf mould collected from a local wood. This encourages insects to
remain in the flight rather than going on nocturnal wanderings in search of
better conditions. Grass cuttings and horse manure are placed around shrubs.
This acts as a fertilising mulch to the plants which in turn provide the shade
which many insects prefer when breeding.
A rotting fruit stack is invaluable. A local greengrocer saves boxes of
unsaleable fruit for my birds. This is piled on the floor of the flight in a
sheltered position so that it is not affected by direct rainfall. The amount of
livefood, fruit flies and the like, generated by the stack is amazing. Grass
cuttings, manure and fruit are turned over every couple of days to reveal
insects and make them readily available to the birds. The carpet of leaf
mould provides rootlets for nesting material.

At one time, I used to use branches with natural holes in them as nesting
sites, but I now use well-used, discarded Budgerigar nest-boxes. These have
the advantage of an inspection flap which permits me to remove chicks when
they are five days old so that they can be hand-fed, by my wife, until they are
self-supporting. Hand-rearing will be seen by some as a chore and, indeed,
the task of feeding every half hour until 10pm and then starting again at
6.30am can be demanding, but it lasts for only a couple of weeks. When the
fact that Redstarts have only one nest of eggs is taken into account, it is well
worthwhile to avoid the possibility that the parents will not be able to gather
enough livefood and so lose a whole year's breeding potential.
The hand rearing mixture consists of mini-mealworms, cleaned maggots
(with reluctance due to the risk of botulism) and chrysalis to provide roughage.
These are chopped up, on a board, with a Stanley knife, two drops of a
multivitamin, such as Abidec, are added and pasteurised milk is used to
make a paste. This is fed, as wet as possible, with a spatula.
Redstarts can be kept without a licence, but can only be sold under a
special licence granted by the DOE, which needs to satisfy itself that the
birds concerned have been bred, legally in captivity. If I can breed four or
five Redstarts each year from my three pairs, I am very pleased. If more
experienced Softbill breeders join the BBC breeding programme we could
soon be in a position that there will be so many Redstarts available that it
will be difficult to deny this beautiful British Bird a place on the show bench.

1995 was a very good year for the Bird Department with 73 species of
birds successfully reared from a total of 86 that hatched chicks. The highlights
were our first successful breedings of Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis.
Wrinkled Hornbillsyfceras corrugatus , Mauritius Kestrel Falco punctatus,
and Golden Conures Aratinga guarouba.
The season actually began the previous December when the Emus
Dromaius novaehollandiae began laying eggs which the male incubated over
winter but no chicks were hatched. The Rheas Rhea americana , were more
successful in that they hatched five chicks in July all of which were reared.
Young female Red-necked Ostriches Struthio camelus massaicus , were
received on loan from Cotswold Wildlife Park and from Fota Wildlife Park,
Eire, and have recently been introduced to our older male.
Twenty-two Humboldt's Penguin Spheniscus humboldti chicks were
hatched under their parents between late March and July. Of these twenty
removed shortly after hatching were successfully hand-reared but two left
under their parents failed to survive.
Following close on the arrival of two White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus
from Tierpark Berlin in 1994, we received a further three White Pelicans from
Tierpark in 1995. Another White Pelican, a pair of Dalmatian Pelicans
Pelecanus crispus and four European Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia were
received in July from Jurong Bird Park, Singapore. Four more Spoonbills
which arrived from Birdworld, Famham, in October have joined the Black
Storks, Ciconia nigra , (recently received from Munich Zoo and Cotswold
Wildlife Park) in the main Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita flight. Waldrapp
Ibis reared young in this flight and also in the new "Europe on the Edge"
aviary. Other birds nesting in "Europe on the Edge" included Little Egrets
Egrettagarzetta. Red-crested Pochard Sett a rufina , White-headed Ducks Oxyura
leucocephala , Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris , and Rock Doves
Columba livia. Both the White-headed Ducks and Red-crested Pochard were
successfully parent-reared providing extra interest for Zoo visitors.
Waterfowl reared elsewhere in the Zoo included Black-necked Swans

The Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber hatched and reared four
chicks, and the Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis reared five
chicks of six hatched.
The Mauritius Kestrels laid a clutch of 5 eggs which they were allowed
to incubate until a week after laying of the final egg. These were then removed
to the incubator and replaced by dummies. Two chicks hatched but one was
rather weak and did not survive. Following recommended protocol the
remaining chick was returned to its parents at 9 days. The female rejected it
attacking it in the nest. A second attempt at introducing the chick when 12
days old met with similar failure and we abandoned attempts at parent-
rearing of this chick. One of the chick&apos;s wings was broken as a result of
aggression from the female. This was set and subsequently healed without
any indication of the previous injury. We were fortunate to learn of an
orphaned chick Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus handed in to Knowsley
Safari Park. This bird was reared together with the Mauritius Kestrel to
reduce the risks of human imprinting. The Common Kestrel was subsequently
hacked back to the wild by staff at Thurstaston Country Park and the Mauritius
Kestrel youngster is now living at the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode. A second
clutch of three eggs was left under the parents for full incubation but none of
these hatched.
Three Bare-faced Curassows Crax fasciolata were reared. All three were
females in contrast to 1994 when all five youngsters were males. One Variable
Chachalaca Ortalis motmot was parent-reared but the breeding female died
in early winter leaving only this youngster and its father in the collection.
New to Chester were a group of Grey-headed Chachalacas Ortalis cinereiceps
on loan from Banham Zoo. These are most quarrelsome amongst themselves
even within the very large free-flight area of the Tropical House. However,
they do not molest the other birds and their boldness makes them popular
with our visitors.
Pheasants reared included Temminck&apos;s Tragopan Tragopan temminckii ,
Satyr Tragopan Tragopan satyr a, Himalayan Monals Lophophorus impeyanus
and Edwards' Pheasants Lophura edxvardsi. New to the collection were a
pair of Malayan Crestless Firebacks Lophura erythrophthalma
erythrophthalma received on loan from Hamerton Wildlife Park. Other new
arrivals included a pair of Green Peafowl Pavo muticus , and a pair of Ocellated
Turkeys, Agriocharis ocellata. Common Peafowl, Pavo cristatus were
allowed to parent-rear chicks on the paddocks but the most important
breedings in 1995 were those of Congo Peafowl.
A new pair of Congo Peafowl received from Antwerp Zoo in February
1995 quickly settled down in their aviary in the Tropical House and a first
clutch of three eggs were laid in mid-April. These eggs were removed for
artificial incubation and then transferred to be put under a bantam prior to
hatching. Two chicks were hatched and both successfully reared under the

foster. A second clutch of three eggs laid in mid-May were removed for
artificial incubation, replacing these eggs with dummies. Before hatching
the eggs were returned to the female. Three chicks hatched but one died
shortly after hatching. Because of concerns over possible sand ingestion
and impaction the parents and chicks were later moved together to a small
adjacent holding area with a plastic matting floor and held there for three
weeks before return to the main aviary.
The Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis which reared two chicks in
one brood in 1994, hatched only one chick in 1995. This was again parent-
reared; the seventh to be reared from this pair and the sixth parent-reared.
Infertile eggs were again laid by the Wattled Crane Bugeranus carunculatus ,
resulting in the decision to try her with a different male in 1996. An exchange
of males with the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, has now resulted in renewed
hopes for fertile eggs next year.
The female Sun-Bittern Eurypyga helias received from Bourton-on-the-
Water in 1994 was tentatively introduced to the aviary with the two males in
1995. These two males had been living together since 1969 and it was
hoped that the female would select one of these for a partner. In the event,
one of the males was found dead, believed killed by the other male. The
surviving male and female went on to build a small mud platform and line
this nest with moss but no eggs were laid. The female is thought to be over
twenty-five years old and perhaps we should not be over optimistic as she
may now be too old to lay.
One Crowned Plover Vanellus coronatus was reared but unlike the over-
prolific Rock Doves in "Europe on the Edge", neither the Stone Curlews
Burhinus oedicnemus nor Avocets Recurvirosta avocetta showed any
indication of nesting.
Nicobar Pigeons Caloenas nicobarica , Superb Fruit Doves Ptilinopus
superbus, Jambu Fruit Dove Ptilinopus jambu, Speckled Pigeons, Columba
guinea and Diamond Doves Geopelia cuneata were bred. We still await
success with our Pink Pigeons Columba mayeri , and with the Blue Crowned
Pigeons Goura cristata. Both species laid in 1995, the Blue Crowned Pigeons
for the first time at Chester. Although their first eggs were infertile, the last,
more encouragingly, was fertile but failed to hatch. Most of the Pink Pigeon
eggs were infertile, and the few fertile eggs broke down very early during
incubation.

pair had to be separated because of aggression from the male, probably a
result of him entering breeding condition before she was ready. A second
pair of Palm Cockatoos and two male White-tailed Black Cockatoos
Calyptorhynchus latirostris were received on loan from HM Customs and
Excise. The former were confiscated from an Eastern-European ship docked
in Glasgow and the latter suggested to have been smuggled into the UK as
eggs.
Six Blue-eyed Cockatoos Cacatua ophthalmica were sent on loan to other
collections and three more bred in 1995. Sadly one of our original females
received at Chester Zoo in 1966 died after 29 years in the collection. No chicks
had been reared from this female for fifteen years and she had recently been
paired to a male that was also poorly represented by offspring. It was then all
the more concerning that she died leaving an egg in the nest box. This egg was
removed for artificial incubation and the chick was hand-reared. This hatching
occurring after the death date of the female parent caused considerable problems
for our computer's logic but great satisfaction and relief to ourselves! Other
parrots reared included a female Vosmaeri Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus
vosmaeri hatched very early in the year and subsequently sent on loan to Paradise
Park, four Greater Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa , now at Edinburgh Zoo and
Paultons Park, and two Derbyan Parakeets Psittacula derbycma. The Red-
fronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys which reared five chicks in 1994, reared a
brood of four in 1995. Two Blue and Gold Macaws Ara ararauna , were reared
and a female Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis was received on loan
from Loro Parque to pair with Chester's male. Four Green-checked Amazon
Parrots Amazona viridigenalis were reared by their parents. The female Cuban
Amazon Amazona leucocephala was seriously attacked by her male partner
during the incubation period and the pair had to be separated and their eggs
removed for artificial incubation. Three chicks were hatched and successfully
hand-reared. A female Red-tailed Amazon Amazona brasiliensis was received
on loan from Loro Parque and has now been paired with a male on loan from
Paradise Park, Hayle. We are very pleased to have the opportunity to work with
these endangered Amazons at Chester.
The Golden Conures Aratinga guarouba hatched a chick in 1994 but
lost it shortly after hatching. It was therefore decided to remove their first
clutch in 1995 for incubation and hand-rearing. Only one of three eggs of
the first clutch was fertile but this was successfully hatched and hand-reared.
The second clutch comprised three eggs, two of which were fertile. One
hatched by the parents died on the first or second day after hatching; the
second was removed to the incubator for hatching and hand-reared. The
first of these chicks was introduced to its parents when five months old. The
parents were alarmed at first but soon interacted with, and became very
protective of the youngster behaving as if they had themselves reared the
chick. The second has recently been introduced to this "family group". One

pair of Blue-throated Conures Pyrrhura cruentata hatched three chicks but
very disappointingly all three died at three weeks old with post-mortem
indicating Klebsiella. The Slender-billed Conures Enicognathus
leptorhvnchus again reared four chicks and one Thick-billed Parrot
Rhvnchopsitta pachyrhyncha was hatched and reared by it's parents.
The Red-crested Touracos Tauraco erythrolophns hatched a chick but
failed to rear it; another hatched in the incubator was successfully hand-
reared. One Violaceous Touraco Musophaga violacea was reared by its
parents and two more were hand-reared. The breeding pair of Schalow's
Touracos Tauraco schalowi were both lost through pseudotuberculosis in
March leaving us with only two males. Foreshadowing our experience with
the Blue-eyed Cockatoos, an egg recently laid by the Schalow's was saved
from the nest and artificially incubated and hand-reared. With
uncharacteristic good fortune this youngster proved to be a female and has
now been paired with one of the males.
Only one Spectacled Owl Pulsatrix perspicillata , but four White-faced
Scops Owls Otus leucotis , two Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca , and two Barn
Owls, Tyto alba , were reared. As in previous years, the Barn Owls were
donated to the Keele University Barn Owl release scheme and research project
now being supervised jointly through Keele University and Chester Zoo.
The Ferruginous Pygmy Owls Glaucidium brasilianum laid infertile eggs.
The Great Grey Owls Strix nebulosa and Milky Eagle Owls Bubo lacteus
have yet to show any interest in breeding and we have had no success in
finding a mate for our single female Vermiculated Fishing Owl Scotopelia
bouvieri. Four Tawny Frogmouths Podargus strigoides were hand-reared
but one that hatched under the parents died at 4 days old. Attempts at
returning older hand-reared chicks to the parents proved unsuccessful in
that although they were brooded and defended by the nesting female, they
were not fed by the adults.
A pair of Blue-crowned Motmots Momotus momota which share the central
aviary of the Bird House with four Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber successfully
reared a chick for the first time at Chester. Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes
buccinator fledged one chick and two more African Grey Hornbills Tockus
nasutus epirhinus were reared. When first bred at Chester in 1989 and 1988
respectively, the breeding of these hornbills caused considerable interest but
neither was as important as the fledging of the four Wrinkled Hornbills Aceros
corrugatus in 1995. A separate account of this breeding has been prepared for
the Avicultural Magazine. The Great Indian Hornbills Buceros bicornis , again
nested without success and we await a first breeding attempt from the Rhinoceros
Hornbills Buceros rhinoceros. A new female Rhinoceros Hombill, hopefully
more interested in our male, has now been received on loan from Lotherton
Bird Gardens with our female transferred to Lotherton. This also should work
better in that in the shape of her casque the newfemale more closely resembles

the male whose flat casque indicates he is of the Javan race Buceros rhinoceros
silvestris.
Chessington Zoo most generously loaned a male Toco Toucan Ramphastos
toco now paired with our female. Lesser Green Broadbills Calyptomena
viridis are new to the collection with five established birds, two males and
three females, received from three different sources. Red-eared Bulbuls
Pycnonotusjocosus, Fairy Bluebirds Irena puella , and Asian Glossy Starlings
Aplonis panayensis , were reared in the free-flight area of the Tropical House.
Other softbills bred included Red-billed Magpies Urocissa erythrorhyncha ,
Azure-winged Magpie Cyanopica cyana , and Superb Spreo Starlings Spreo
superbus. One fledgling from a first brood of Spreo Starlings was seen
carrying food to the second brood nest in this way mirroring the co-operative
behaviour of helping at the nest observed in the wild.
One of the most satisfying results of the 1995 breeding season was the
rearing of eleven Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi. We retained
three young Rothschild's' Mynah that had been reared at Chester in 1994 to
split previously unsuccessful pairs. New pairs were made up as combinations
of older birds with yearlings. In 1995 this proved successful only for the
pair which comprised an older male and young female. Four clutches laid
by this young female resulted in nine chicks of which five were successfully
reared. Although the other two newly formed pairs were very active and
continually courting and nest-building only one of the females laid and no
chicks were hatched from either pair.
Finally we should not lose sight of a small collection of birds in our
Finch Flight. Chinese Painted Quail Excalfactoria chinensis , Mexican
Housefinches Carpodacus mexicanus. Red-billed Firefinches Lagonosticta
senegala , Red-cheeked Cordon-Bleu Uraeginthus bengalus , and Bicheno
Finches Poephila bichenovii hatched chicks but not all were reared. Gouldian
Finches Chloebia gouldiae fledged two chicks in this outside aviary in mid-
October.
Even in December a few birds were still breeding. Two more Speckled
Pigeons fledged in the warmth of the Tropical House and four more
Humboldt's Penguins hatched by the parents were taken for hand-rearing.
An Eclectus Parrot hatched in mid-December was left with its parents which
we are hoping may be able to rear it despite the cold, wintry weather.
Many avicultural challenges remain and we look forward to meeting
some of these in 1996 perhaps by breeding species for which success has so
far eluded us at Chester. We must also continue working towards providing
conditions under which birds will rear their own young without our assistance.
Only then can we begin to meet the requirements of conservation breeding
that we have set as one of our main aims at Chester Zoo.
