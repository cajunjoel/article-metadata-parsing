Once more we have come to the close of our avicultural
year, and, as we survey the pile of monthly numbers of the
Magazine, we feel satisfied that a volume has been produced that
our members may be proud of. The Magazine has kept well up
to its high standard of quality, and many very valuable articles,
calculated to increase our knowledge of the life-habits of birds,
have been published.
Although the Balance Sheet for the year will not be ready
for some weeks, we believe that, when it appears, it will show our
financial position to be a very satisfactory one.
In the volume now completed is recorded, the successful
breeding of the following species for the first time in the United
Kingdom : Forsteir's Lorikeet [Trichoglossus forsteni), the Pileated
Finch (Coryphospinguspileatus), the Regent Bower-bird ( Sericulus
melinus ), the Pectoral Finch (Munia pecloralis), the Green Avada-
vat ( Stictospiza formosa ), Boutke's Parrakeet (. Neophema bourkei),
the Australian Green-winged Pigeon ( Chalcophaps chrysochlora),
the Tambourine Dove ( Tympanistria tympanistria ), the Black
Tanager ( Tachyphonus melaleucus) , the Great-billed Andaman
Parrakeet (. Palceornis magnirostris ), the Yellowish Finch (Sycalis
arvensis ), and the Harlequin and Australian Quails ( Coturnix
delegorgtiei and C. pecloralis.)
Six coloured plates, one figuring a species ( Trichoglossus
johnstonics) named after one of our members and almost new to
science; a number of uncoloured plates, and numerous text
illustrations have been published.
The membership of our Society increases in a satisfactory
manner but we are not quite satisfied with our numbers, as we
feel sure there are a great many who would be very glad to join

our ranks if they knew of our Society and Magazine. We hope
therefore that our members will do their best to introduce others
who are interested in the subject of aviculture.
There is one complaint which we feel bound to make, and
that is that such a small percentage of our members contribute
to our pages. We want all interesting observations recorded,
whether they refer to rare or common birds, and members should
not fail to record their breeding results.
Finally we would express our thanks to all those members,
whether officers or otherwise, who have helped us to produce a
thoroughly good volume.

The Medal may be awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine,
within about eight weeks from the date of the hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require.
The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be
old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their
parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full, so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the
breeder. Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice an}&apos;other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
I11 every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as circumstances will permit.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures 2 |inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a
nest containing eggs, and the words " The Avicultural Society--Founded
1894." O11 the reverse is the following inscription: "Awarded to {name of
donee) for rearing young of {name of species) a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom.

THE BLACK-THROATED LORIKEET.
Trichoglossus nigrigularis, G. R. gray.
By W. A. Harding, F.Z.S.
In 1904 I became the possessor of a pair of these birds
through the courtesy of Mrs. Johnstone, who had just introduced
them into .England for the first time. The Black - throated
Lorikeet inhabits, according to the British Museum Catalogue,
the Ke Islands and Aru Islands, groups lying to the South West
of New Guinea, and is also found in New Guinea itself, along
the middle part of the Fly river.
Its length is eleven inches, and its plumage, of which the
accompanying coloured plate renders a description unnecessary,
very closely resembles that of the Green-naped Lorikeet (T.
cyanogrammus). In nigrigularis, says Mivart, the occiput is less
purple, and the dark transverse bands of the breast are narrower
than in cyanogrammus ; the red of the breast is also paler and
more orange in hue, and the middle of the abdomen is darker--
"a blackish green." Wallace, writing of the Aru Islands
[.Annals and Magazine cf Natural History, New Series, Vol. XX.
p. 475] evidently alludes to the Black-throated Lorikeet in the
following passage : " The very first bird to attract one's attention
at Dobbo [Aru Islands] is a most beautiful brush-tongued parro-
quet, closely allied to Trichoglossus cyanogrammus, Wagl. It
frequents in flocks the Casuarina-trees which line the beach, and
its crimson under wings and orange breast make it a most con-
spicuous and brilliant object. Its twittering whistle may be
heard almost constantly in the vicinity of the trees it frequents."

The Black-throated Lorikeet.
Guillemard |_. Zoological Society&apos;s Proceedings, 1885, p. 623] who
came across this bird during the voyage of the Marchesa, notes
that it is "common at Dobbo especially," that it differs from
cyanogrammus in the greater length of the tail and wing, and is
subject to considerable variation, "the abdomen being green in
some, in others bluish-black."
My birds arrived in fine condition, and, after they had
settled down in the large flight cage I had provided for them,
became the most charming pets. The cock bird delighted in
hopping upon my hand and carefully licking the tips of my
fingers with his brush-tipped tongue. His less venturesome
mate displayed the greatest excitement during these proceedings,
whether from jealousy or fear I was never able to determine, and
he would constantly fly to her side and reassure her of his safety
and devotion with many caresses and discordant cries.
A log nesting-box placed in their cage was a source of
unending interest to them,-but though the hen slept in it regu-
larly, no eggs were ever laid. Their habits in captivity generally
resembled those of a pair of Swainson's Lorikeets inhabiting an
adjoining cage. They performed in a rather exaggerated degree,
the same amusing antics, acrobatic feats and quaint dances, but
were less noisy and of a more gentle disposition.
The end of these brilliant, playful creatures was as sudden
as it was tragic. I11 death they&apos;' were not divided. About a y r ear
after their arrival they both died on the same day during my
absence from home. They had always been in excellent health,
and I have good reasons for supposing that their end was due,
not to any inherent weakness, but to some carelessness in the
preparation of the milk-sop which formed their staple food. In
my specimens, which proved on dissection to be a pair, the
breast-feathers of the female were rather deeper in colour, and
the dark bands on their edges were less narrow than in the case
of the male. It is to be hoped that these very desirable birds
may become more common in this country.

A TAME TUIPARA PARRAKEET.
By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
Whether most of the individuals of this species--which is
also called the Golden-fronted Parrakeet ( Brotogerys tuipara &apos;)--
are naturally tame I do not know, but the one I had (for I have
given it away as a present) is most extraordinarily so.
Soon after its arrival it became extremely affectionate,
allowing me to take it out of its cage and handle it as if it had
been a puppy-dog, being moreover evidently ill at ease when not
with me. If I put it on the back of a chair and then walked to
the other end of the room, the little bird would immediately take
flight with a short shriek and alight on my shoulders. He would
not even sit on a chair close to me of a morning when my
shaving was in progress, but would fly on to my shoulder as fast
as I tried to laud him back on the chair. So with such mani-
festations of affection I was curious to try him in the garden : a
small garden on the Normandy sea coast, where I was staying
for a few weeks. I put the Tuipara on the back of a garden-seat,
and walked away. When about twenty yards distant from him,
off he flew like an arrow on to my shoulder. I repeated the
experiment (very rash !) and that time he seemed to become
alarmed, for although he made straight for me, he circled round,
each circle becoming wider and wider until at last he went quite
away to the other side of the small valley where there are large
gardens full of trees, amongst which the villas are dotted. Oft
I went in search, only to finally return crestfallen and saying,
" You've no one to blame but your stupid self! " Then suddenly
I heard the little shrill sharp cry of my Tuipara in the far
distance. I called and whistled. Again ! back I went until I
had at last traced his calls to a garden, over the palings of which
I peered from the road. I whistled and the Tuipara answered.
At last a gardener walked across the lawn, and I in my best
French (I say my best!) " Pardon ! Have you seen a little green
parrakeet ? " " Mais oui Monsieur," was the answer, " he is here
at the top of a high tree." " Please let me come in," I said, " and
please let me approach him all alone." When the little Tuipara
saw me he redoubled his cries, he stretched himself out, he

thought " Can I fly down all that way ? " He hung on by his
bill, letting himself down to a more outside branch, and so pro-
ceeding until he reached the uttermost edge. Then he stretched
himself forward, then he drew back! Would he ever come? A
little shriek and the next moment he dropped from the top ot
that tall tree almost like a stone into my very arms : literally !
for I stretched out my arms, and he came between them, and so
I clasped him to me.
The French gardener with two indoor servants who had
come out to watch gaped in astonishment, but not more so than
I did !

LORIKEET.
Trichoglossus forsteni.
By Mrs. Micheu,.
Perhaps it may be of interest to members to hear that this
year a pair of Forsten's Lorikeets, purchased from Jamrach in
May 1900, have reared one young one in my outdoor aviary.
The hen laid two eggs in July in the hollow part of an old tree-
trunk. I took these away, but on the iSth of August, hearing a
curious hissing sound, I examined the log, and found it pro-
ceeded from a young bird in the place where I had found the
eggs. Its head was fully feathered, and it had the yellow collar,
bnt the rest of the body was covered with soft grey down. The
little bird was left entirely to its parents, whom I saw feeding it
in the way that doves feed their young.
On the first of September the young Lorikeet left the nest,
and I found it clinging to the netting of the aviary. Being afraid
the other birds might injure it, I had it removed, with its parents,
to a small inner aviary, where it is now. To-day (October 3rd) I
saw it eating seed, and I think the parents no longer feed it. It
is very fond of grapes, and has had some every day since it came
out of the nest. The plumage is just like that of its parents, the
rose-red on the breast, and under wing-coverts, and the green on
the wing is cpiite as light as in the adults. The head is rather
duller, and the eye is dark, without the red light the old birds
have. The underpart of the body is well feathered and just the

colouring of the parents, but grey down shows amongst the red
feathers on the breast; the bill is still black, and it has not yet
grown a tail. It is very healthy, and its parents are devoted
to it.
[This very beautiful species, from the Island of Sumbawa, was almost
unknown before about the year 1S96, when quite a number were imported into
this country. It has now become rare again, very few having been im-
ported recently. It has bred in the Calcutta Zoological Gardens, but as far
as we are aware Mrs. Michell's birds are the first to have reared young in
the United Kingdom if not in any European country, and their owner is to-
be heartily congratulated upon her success.

CAGE BIRDS IN FRANKFURT ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS.
By E. G. B. Meade- Waldo, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
During a recent inspection of some ot the Zoological
Gardens on the Continent I was much impressed with the
beautiful condition of the collection of "German birds" in the
Zoological Gardens of Frankfurt-am-Main, and possibly a short
account of this collection may be of interest to readers of the
Avicultural Magazine, for the success appears to depend far more
on careful detail of management than in any particular of their
surroundings. The collection in question occupies the whole
back of the bird-house. The front consisting of large aviaries
opening into open-air aviaries.
There are two tiers of cages in the building all of the
same size, some 2ft. 6in. in length by about 18 in height and
depth. All cages are of the same size, all are served from the
passage at the back, and all have galvanized iron sliding bottoms,
which are thickly covered with quartz grit and sand. The
perches are at each end with one along the front, and all food is
given in glazed white earthenware oval bowls, water being
supplied in similar vessels which also serve as baths. These are
stood in the middle of the back of each cage, and consequently
are out of reach of being fouled in any way by the birds. All
this is very ordinary, and so is the food supplied to the various

birds. For insectivorous birds fresh and best ants' eggs, really
fresh hard-boiled egg, chopped and rubbed through a grating,
grated carrot, currants, elder-berries, and a few mealworms. All
had a little fresh lean beef twice a day, just what they would take
from the fingers, no more. None was left in the cage.
Seed-eating birds had all small seeds, including apparently
unlimited maw seed, and most had a little soft food as well.
There were 88 cages in the house, none containing the
commonest and hardiest species, such as Chaffinch, Bullfinch,
etc., or any large birds with the exception of the two Rock
Thrushes, Golden Oriole, Hoopoe, all of which were in perfect
condition. But it is to the appearance of the birds themselves
that I wish to draw attention. With hardly an exception every
bird was in absolutely faultless condition, tame, bright, spotless,
and covered with bloom, and most were nearly clean-moulted.
Nearly every German warbler was represented, and more beauti-
ful birds than the green alid satin white Wood Warbler, or the
swarthy little Dartfield Warbler, can hardly be imagined. All the
Chats were perfect, as were also the Tits, and the charming little
White-headed Long-tailed Tits were pictures; as were also the
Goldcrests and Firecrests. The Tree Creepers looked well, and
a Grasshopper Warbler, that had been there five years, surprised
me ; beyond being slightly scaly in the legs it looked perfect and
was clear moulted. Each bird seemed to have some little
speciality provided for it. For instance, the Goldcrests fresh
spruce twigs ; the Long-tailed Tits fresh sloe branches; the Tree
Creepers fresh bark. These little extras are given fresh at least
once a day. I saw the Wheatears had stones.
One end of the outside of this house is devoted to the
Woodpeckers, and a more beautiful collection it would be im-
possible to see. All our Woodpeckers were shown, and in
addition the Great Black, the Middle Spotted, and the Grey-
headed (Gecinus vividicanus&apos;). All were perfect , in large metal
lined cages in which a partly decayed log of spruce was placed
every week. Their food was practically the same as that of the
other insectivorous birds, the Pied Woodpeckers having nuts,
etc. added. It will be seen from this that the surroundings of
this beautiful collection were extremely simple, and the food given

was equally so, yet there was not a bad specimen or unhealthy
looking bird in the collection. There were practically no new
arrivals, nearly all the birds having nearly completed a healthy
moult. This success could only have been attained by attention
to minute details, cleanliness in everything, only the best food
given in the right way and at the right time, and wants antici-
pated. I may add that there were no Hirundines in this collection.

By Albert J. Salter.
The rearing of King Parrakeets does not fall to the lot of
the majority possessing this beautiful species. Fortune has
however favoured me this season, and I have one young bird, the
account of which I trust will be of some interest to the readers
of the Avicullural Magazine.
In the first place the aviary, which these birds have
absolutely to themselves, consists of a house 4ft. by 4ft., and a
flight, all wire, 8ft. by 8ft. In the former, barrels partially hidden
by branches are suspended near the roof, whilst one corner of
the floor is completely screened by logs ; outside a large hollow
log, about 4ft. long by 18 to 20 inches through, is placed.
The birds are a fine pair; in fact the male is a Crystal
Palace winner, and very richly coloured. They were paired in
March 1894. In the spring of the present year the cock was seen
several times feeding the hen, and in May they suddenly took to
tearing up the grass in the corner of the flight nearest the path,
and completely cleared a space of over a yard square ; here, on
June 2nd, the hen laid her&apos;first egg, the worst possible place, and
most exposed, without the slightest hollow to prevent the eggs
rolling about. Knowing they are supposed to be very shy and
easily disturbed I hardly knew what to do, but finally decided to
place the egg in one corner of the interior, with the hope of the
next egg being laid there also. This was not the case, for on the
evening of the 3rd another egg was in the same position as the
first. Now came the question of what was to be done, as the
first storm would soak the place, and people w T ere frequently
passing within a yard. To hurry matters forward it began to

on the roof for shelter, and after dark a piece of canvas was
quickly wired all along the front and half one end to about 5ft.
high, completely screening the corner. The first egg was returned
to its former position, and every other day one more was added,
until there were five. The eggs are dead white, about the size of
a pigeon's, and variable in shape, some being nearly as round as
an owl's, whilst others are more oblong and pointed at one end.
The hen commenced sitting with the third egg, and after
a few days took not the slightest notice of my entering the aviary
to feed them. From the 21st onwards the hen became very rest-
less, leaving the nest several times a day, in fact I quite expected
her to forsake it altogether, the weather at the time being very
kot. On the 28th I observed the shell of an egg pushed 011 one
side, and another the next day. These were the only two that
hatched, but upon later examination I found that one other egg
had just commenced to. incubate; the remaining two were
unfertile, probably owing to the cold weather and some very
heavy thunderstorms at the end of May. The young birds grew
rapidly, and were fed very largely on groundsel which was
supplied fresh twice daily. The seeds supplied were canary,
hemp, and sunflower, in unlimited quantities, the latter being the
one principally taken by the old birds, and on which they thrive
well ; a little boiled maize is given occasionally.
I frequently saw the hen feeding the young birds, often
being within three yards of them, and could therefore watch the
process closely, as she did not mind in the slightest. The
manner of doing so was exactly the same as the old birds feed
one another ; the food is not forced down the throat of the young,
but simply placed in their mouth ; of course the process of
regurgitation and feedinggives one the impression that it is, but
by close observation I am convinced that such is not the case.
The young birds will take a little food off a stick if placed inside
the mouth, but it must be very sloppy, and the difficulty of
doing so is to get them to open their mouths. If they start
screaming it is easy, but I do not think it is possible to give
sufficient to keep the bird alive. One of these two was much
smaller than the other, and finally died at about three weeks
old, I think from insufficient food.

The eyes open in about twenty-four days, and previous to
that they are able to waddle about, as I found them one morning
in the long grass, and two or three yards from their nest. I placed
them in a large flower saucer with some dry earth in, which kept
them at home for some time. To keep off the driving rain I was
obliged to lean a board about 3ft. by 2ft. against the wire over
them, a proceeding which the parents did not resent in any way.
They carefully observed what took place, and seemed to quite
understand that it was done for their benefit.
On August 3rd I found the young bird scrambling up the
wires in a very clumsy manner, but it was able to fly sufficiently
to reach the ground in safety.
At this age (5 weeks) all but the head was completely
feathered, this being the last portion to lose the pin feathers.
The tail feathers have about an eighth of an inch at the end of
each brick red, except the two central ones, which are plain
green ; in other respects the colour resembles the adult hen.
I judge this young bird to be a male for the following-
reasons, which, if some one who has reared this species will
verify, there will be little difficulty in distinguishing the sex of
the young birds as soon as fledged.
The shape of the head is well rounded like the male parent,
whereas the female has a flatter head ; the bill is orange whereas
the hen is black ; the red feathers of the breast meet the green in
a clearly cut line, and do not gradually merge into one another,
the red colour being decidedly a more brilliant shade than that of
the hen.
Why this particular pair should choose the most public
and exposed position for nesting I cannot imagine. One very
noticeable trait was that the hen completely lost all shyness
during incubation and feeding, but now the young bird is pretty
well grown up she is quite as shy as before.
These birds prefer to roost in the open during summer,
but in the winter are driven into the enclosed portion, and after
a few times go in regularly themselves.
The Zoological Society had two fine King Parrakeets two
years ago, one being especially brilliant, but both have vanished
and some more are wanted in their place, but I feel convinced

Mrs. Howard Williams,
they would not remain for any length of time in the miserably
small cages I saw them in, whereas in the new aviaries recently
erected against the south side of the Parrot house they would
probably thrive for years. I hope many more such aviaries will
be erected in these beautiful gardens.

Coryphospingus pileatus.
By Mrs. Howard Williams.
In March, 1903, I made an expedition to the East End in
search of new birds, and at one of the well-known dealers I
was shown some Pileated Finches, a species then quite unknown
to me.
Greatly admiring their lovely scarlet crests and soft dark
grey plumage I bore them home in triumph, fondly believing
that I had secured a true pair, and quite unconscious that the
aforesaid dealer had sold me two cocks. When we reached home
they were put into an aviary in a conservatory with other finches,
principally Australian, where they flourished exceedingly. After
a good deal of study it was decided that the bolder bird with
his constantly erected crest was the cock, and the timid one
which preferred the topmost perch in the aviary must be the hen.
The birds were often let loose in the conservatory for hours
together, and the Pileated Finches seemed specially to enjoy the
freedom, and had a very keen eye for any insect which might
incautiously show itself.
In a few months the new edition of " Foreign Finches
in Captivity " came into my hands, when the discover}&apos; was
speedily made that a hen Pileated Finch is a browner shade
of grey than her mate, and that she lacks the scarlet crest, which
is replaced by a tuft of brownish feathers capable of being
erected to some extent.
I was fortunate in getting two hens very shortly after, but
nothing seemed further from their thoughts than nesting, and
in February of last year one died. The finer cock bird
unfortunately followed suit in April, and as he was in perfect

health and plumage we concluded that he must have injured
himself during his rapid flights in the conservatory.
The remaining pair spent the summer in a garden aviary,
but made no attempt at nesting, and were brought indoors for
the winter. This spring we moved to another house and both
indoor and outdoor aviaries had to be taken down and set up
afresh.
The position of the garden aviary is certainly better than
before. It is in a sheltered corner, with the long side of the flight
facing south, while the north side is protected by a thick privet
hedge, boarded behind, the wire being fastened to the fence so
that the hedge is included in the flight. There is a plum tree in
the middle, a laurel under it, and sundry bushes and shrubs
besides.
Moving house is a serious business; it is much more
serious when birds have to be caught and housed somehow
during the process. Fortunately the weather was fine and warm,
and we solved the problem by setting up the out-door aviary
first, catching up the birds by two's and three's, driving over with
them as often as possible and letting them straight into the
garden aviary. So it came about that my grey friends among
the rest were put out of doors the first week in Maj^, certainly six
weeks earlier than I had intended to risk them outside. On
Sunday, July 2nd, someone pointed out that there was certainly
a new nest in the laurel bush. O11 Monday I peeped very
cautiously and found that some birds had taken possession of a
shoot which had been topped, and had sprouted out all round
after the manner of a rhododendron when the flower has fallen.
All sorts of odds and ends had been used to fill up the
space between the young shoots--fibre, a scrap or two of paper,
combings from a white Pomeranian (kindly sent me by another
member), fragments of Ostrich feather, and a shaving or two.
On this foundation the open nest itself was made, woven entirely
of fibre (rope untwisted and cut into short lengths). There was
no lining of any kind, and the nest was tiny, barely two inches
across, and shallow. It was well sheltered by the long drooping
leaves of the laurel, but to make all safe I put a covering over
the wire roof just above the bush in case of storms.

Mrs. Howard Williams,
In this wee nest lay a large white egg, so large that at first
sight I wondered if by chance the Diamond Dove had laid it,
and I wondered still more what would happen if many more
eggs were laid. Next morning a second had appeared, and the
following day there was a third.
As the nest could not possibly have held another egg it
was as well that the bird seemed to consider that she had
enough. Even then I was not absolutely certain as to what
birds the nest belonged, they were so clever in slipping on and
off without being seen.
The first egg was hatched by the morning of July 14th,
and the other two followed 011 consecutive days. By that time
there was 110 doubt as to the parentage of the nestlings, for both
Pileated Finches came eagerly for mealworms, the hen alwa3^s
first, as soon as I appeared in the morning. The hen also liked
soft food, but I do not remember seeing the cock take any. The
young birds were naked/except for a few patches of down : they
were dark in colour, and very large. They grew and feathered
fast, but naturally there was a good deal of difference in size be-
tween the oldest and youngest. As there was a tremendous rain
on Sunday, July 23rd, I did not go into the flight, only putting
the food as usual into the house. On Monday I went in fearing
the little ones might have suffered and to my distress found
the youngest thrown out and quite dead. It had very long and
strong legs and its wing feathers were well advanced, but other-
wise it w r as not very forward, and I fancy it was a case of the
weakest going to the wall, or in this case, to the ground. On
looking into the nest I could see only one young bird, the
middle one, and at once I began to seek for the eldest fearing it
might also have joined the majority. Just as I was giving up the
search for the supposed corpse I saw a small grey object exactly
the colour of the earth on which it sat, very still, but very much
alive, watching my movements with its bright eyes. It was
evidently the missing baby.
It seemed to be fully feathered, there was no trace of down
left on its head, which was dark grey, and the principal sign of
its extreme youth was that it had not a vestige of a tail. It
could flutter strongly and I tried to catch it and replace it in

oo
the nest, but its parents came flying round in such fear and
anxiety that I left them to look after it. Two days later the
second bird had also left the nest. They seemed to be kept by
their parents almost entirely on the ground under the bushes,
and were fed there at first, but by the time they were a fortnight
old they could fly to a perch five feet from the ground, and
their tails were just visible. Both parents appeared to feed the
youngsters, and were most attentive to them.
It seems curious that these birds should build such a
small nest for their size, and it was not for lack of material.
Perhaps they knew their babies would not need its shelter for
long. An interesting point was the extraordinary way the
birds feathered between the eighth and tenth days. At a week
old their heads still looked downy, but at ten days their feathers
looked smooth and complete, and the birds could flutter well. I
suppose the absence of a tail is a kindly arrangement of
Providence, for they were so crowded together that I could not
tell where one bird ended and the next began, and there was no
room for tails even of the smallest!
I went away from home when the young Pileated Finches
were little more than a fortnight old, and I returned in five
weeks to find them almost, but not quite, as big as their parents,
and with tails of the usual length. The smaller one had lighter
wings than the other, and its head is quite flat, with no sign of
crest, but the larger bird is I think certainly a hen, I have seen it
erect its brownish head-feathers. They have been caught up
and are now in an aviary indoors for fear of early frosts.
The old birds seemed inclined to nest again, but it was too
late and cold to risk leaving them in the garden, so the cock has
been caught and is in a flight cage where he seems happy and
sings his harsh little song a good deal. The hen refuses
absolutely to enter the trap cage, and is still in the garden
aviary, but we hope she will soon decide to come in and rejoin
her mate. Their cage is large enough to nest in if they like with-
out fear of their little ones being killed by frost.
I fancy though that they got a large quantity of minute
insect life out of doors. All the birds spent much time on the
ground, where they&apos;&apos; continually picked up something, probably

Bird protection is, with many people, cjuite a popular
theme at the present time, and, so long as it is carried out on
common-sense lines, and those principally engaged do not allow
themselves to be unduly swayed by mere sentiment, it is
calculated to do a great deal of real good. As a rule, however,
one finds that those chiefly responsible for the movement allow
themselves to be governed to far too great an extent by people
who know little or nothing of the natural history of birds, but
seem to imagine that a bird is a sacred animal, and that, however
harmful it may be to &apos;those engaged in agricultural or fruit-
growing pursuits, it must be protected because it is a bird,
although animals which happen to be clothed in fur or scales,
though they may be less harmful than their feathered con-
temporaries, may be slain wholesale without a protest being
raised.
In years gone by, when egg-collection was not illegal, every
country schoolboy made his collection of birds' eggs, and the
result was that he obtained, besides the eggs, a knowledge of
natural history, while, at the same time checking the undue
increase of the commoner species such as the Songthrush and
Blackbird which, of late years, have increased to so great an
extent that, at the present time, it is next to impossible to grow
strawberries, raspberries or currants in many parts of the country
unless every plant or tree is duly protected by netting, an
expensive process which robs the fruit-grower of most of his
profit. On the other hand, perfectly harmless, and, in many
cases very useful species are allowed to be ruthlessly slain to
satisfy the selfish greed of present-day fashion.
The West-End milliners' shops abound in hideous mon-
strosities in the form of portions of birds, consisting perhaps
of the body of one species with the wings of another, or the

whole skin of a bird with the wings and tail dyed some ugly
unnatural colour, these being intended to adorn the hats of
ladies. In a West-End shop the present writer recently noticed
several skins of Barn Owls and Niglit-jars, some of which had
the wings and tails dyed a brilliant sea-green, while in others
these parts were some other equally incongruous colour. Game-
keepers are always ready enough to slay Owls, but if they know
that there is a certain commercial value in their skins, an extra
inducement towards the massacre of these innocent and most
useful creatures will be prseented to them.
The obtaining of the plumes of the Egrets, which are
known as "ospreys," is invariably accompanied by the utmost
cruelty and dastardly waste of life. The various species of
plume-bearing Herons or Egrets only develop the graceful
plumes which adorn the hats and bonnets of thirty per cent, of
European ladies, during the breeding season. They nest in
colonies which the plume-hunters invade when the j^oung birds
are hatched, for they know that the birds, though temporarily
frightened away by their rifles, will quickly return to their help-
less young. Thus the butchery is carried on until the whole
colony is wiped out of existence, with the exception of scores, or
hundreds of helpless young whose piteous voices are only hushed
by death from starvation.
If bird protectionists can do anything to stop this cruel
and barbarous plume trade they will richly deserve the thanks of
every lover of the beautiful in nature, for besides the Egrets, the
wonderful Birds of Paradise and many others are being ruth-
lessly exterminated in order to appease the greed of fashion,
the survival of a barbarous age.
But, as we have said, some of those who are most energetic
in championing the cause of bird protection are inclined to go
too far, with the result that they do more harm than good. From
the United States we learn that the Audubon Societies have so
brought their influence to bear upon the Government that laws
have been passed practically prohibiting private individuals
from practising aviculture, a course which can only be described
as short-sighted policy to say the least of it. Enough has been
published in this journal alone to demonstrate the great value of

<bodyText confidence="0.996742315789474" page_id="32720383"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
aviculture as an aid to the science of ornithology. Valuable as
museum collections are to the student of ornithology, they
teach nothing of the life-habits of birds, and in many cases these
can only be efficiently studied in properly arranged aviaries.
When we are told by those who profess to be great bird
protectionists that it is wrong to keep wild birds in captivity, it
always shows that these people know absolutely nothing about
proper aviculture; their knowledge of captive birds has
probably been derived from a visit to a few small bird shops, or
the Parrot house at the Zoo. where, until recently, the small
finches were kept in the most miserable and unsuitable cages
imaginable.
The purely sentimental bird protectionist is inclined to
judge birds from the human standard, imagining that their
mental capacity is about the same as ours. As a matter of
fact a bird's memory is very short. It lives in the present, not
in the past or future ; its chief concern is the procuring of its
food and escaping from the numerous enemies which are con-
stantly on the watch for it. During prolonged drought or
severe frost or snow it has great difficulty in procuring food,
and the chances are that it will die a lingering death from
starvation, if it manages to escape the talons or claws of some
predatory bird or mammal.
I11 captivity birds very soon entirely throw off their
natural fear of man, and become perfectly contented, with
food in abundance and no enemies to fear. In fact when
properly kept in aviaries they are absolutely happy, a fact to
which every one who has had any experience in aviculture
will readily testify. Were this not the case captive birds
would not sing, build nests, and rear their broods as almost
all are willing enough to do.
But we must not shut our eyes to the fact that aviculture
is, at times, responsible for a considerable amount of needless
cruelty to birds, and one can hardly enter a bird-dealer's shop
without being painfully reminded of this fact. Overcrowding,
uncleanliness and rough handling often result in much suffering
to the poor birds, and this should be put a stop to wherever
possible. With proper care there is no reason why birds should

suffer in the least during importation, and bird-dealers should be
compelled to treat their birds well. It is however a mistake to
imagine that birds, during importation, require to be housed in
large roomy cages,; on the contrary, they often arrive in better
condition, and suffer less from the variable temperature, if
somewhat " closely packed," so long as due attention is paid to
cleanliness, food and water.
The subject of cabinet collecting is one that is somewhat
difficult to deal with. Strict protectionists would never have a
bird killed under any pretence, which, of course, is absurd.
Unfortunately, however, the rarer a species becomes the more is
it sought after by collectors, or dealers who know they will find
a ready sale for every specimen they can procure. We fail to see
any excuse whatever for collecting the few remaining specimens
of a vanishing species to enrich cabinet collections, at any rate
until every effort to preserve the species has failed. A species
once exterminated is gone for ever, and the existence of a few
dried skins in museums is poor consolation for the loss of the
living birds. What right has man to wipe out of existence a
species which he can never re-establish ?
There is, however, in the present writer's opinion, an
excuse for collecting many of the small birds which pass our
shores on migration. Such species could hardly be identified
beyond dispute unless tliey^ were actually shot and examined in
the flesh by a qualified ornithologist; and, by the collection of
such, our knowledge of migration and geographical distribution
has been largely increased. Moreover the birds are those which
merely use our shores as a stepping-stone on the autumn
migration. If some of these were not collected very valuable
records would be lost to science, records which have taught us
much about geographical distribution and the way in which
Eastern forms have a tendency to extend their range west-
ward.
Of course the collecting of birds in foreign lands, whose
natural history is little known, is deserving of all encouragement,
provided that a reasonably limited number of each species is
obtained, for by this means alone can the avifauna of a country
be properly studied.

Mr. C. William Beebe, the Curator of Birds at the New
York Zoological Park, has kindly sent us a copy of the Zoologi-
cal Society's Bulletin, which contains an interesting account and
some beautiful photographs of the fine new Bird House which
has just been erected there, and was opened on July 1st.
The plan of the building represents the letter L&amp;gt; and the
house consists of two large exhibition halls, one of which, that
intended for Parrots, measures sixty-five feet long by fifty feet
wide, its height to the ridge of the roof being about thirty-six
feet. The roof is principally of ribbed glass, which diffuses the
direct rays of the sun. It is intended to further diffuse the light
by growing plants and vines. Fresh air is admitted by means of
thirty-four large windows in the walls, besides which no less
than one hundred and sixty-four panes of roof - glass, each
measuring five feet in length, are made to open.
The two large halls are lined with wall cages or compart-
ments, each being nine to twelve feet in height, and from four
to eight feet square. "Almost without exception," writes Mr.
Beebe, " the rule in the various large aviaries of Zoological
gardens generally, has been to provide large numbers of small
cages, each intended to hold some one species. In the present
building this has been reversed, the cages being adapted for
large groups, either representing a single species or several."
Targe as the side cages are, they are nothing in comparison
with the central flight cage, which measures fifteen by thirty-six
feet, and is about twenty feet high. It is provided with a large
bathing pool fed by a fountain. There are also nineteen outdoor
cages for the hardier birds.
Another excellent arrangement is that all the doors of the
cages are at the back, opening into a keeper's passage which

extends around tlie entire building, making it possible to keep
all the cleaning and feeding operations out of sight.
At the north end of the building the office of the Curator
is situated, and above this is a large glass-roofed laboratory. The
keepers' and store rooms are at the South end, and over these are
three additional rooms of great value as hospitals or for breeding
birds.

Those who have kept birds or mammals under suitable
conditions in captivity have found how very much more can be
learned of their habits in this state than in any other way, and
when people tell us that it is cruel to keep wild animals in
confinement they certainly do not know what they are talking
about. It is only those who are devoted to animals and who
study their every need, who ever keep these creatures, whether
they be birds, mammals, or reptiles. The book before us is the
outcome of a long experience of birds and beasts kept by a great
lover of animals on his estate in Dumfries, and ever} r page is of
absorbing interest to those who, like the author, are fond of
animals. There is much in the book that reminds us of Frank
Buckland, who was himself a friend of our author's, and is men-
tioned several times in the book we are now considering, which,
besides treating of animals in captivity, contains a great many
anecdotes of country life in general.
The portion of the book which treats of the author's
avicultural experience concerns us mostly here, but besides birds
most of the smaller mammals and maiyr reptiles found a home in
Mr. Bell's menagerie.
The author commences his book with an account of his
Emus and Rheas, which takes up no less than 37 pages, and is of.
very great interest. He was not very successful with Rheas, his
first so-called pair proved to be two females, and three other
birds, guaranteed as males were purchased, with no better result

than adding to the stock of females. " This guarantee of sexes,"
writes the author, " is of little value, and for this reason--that
although you may purchase a bird at or near one breeding season,
it frequently happens that, owing to its inborn restlessness and
its new surroundings, it wall not settle down in its new home,
and it may be a year before you can tell which sex you have got
--too late to return it to the sellers, without difficidties.&quot;
The account of the Emus is probably the fullest that has
ever been published, and the author claims, probably quite justly,
to have been the first to breed these birds in Scotland. His
success may&apos; be summed up in his own words : " Emus are rather
an expensive stock to ' lay in.' This, however, did not deter me
from purchasing a pair, as I hoped, if successful, to recoup my-
self the initial outlay of #20, which was the figure charged me
by Mr. Charles Jamrach, of 1S0, St. George Street, East, London,
the world-famed dealer in wild animals. In the above hope I
was not disappointed, asjny readers will understand when I tell
them that not only did my breeding experiment succeed, but that
I sold my young birds, thirty-one in number, at from #8 to #10
per pair without guaranteeing the sexes ; and that when I sold
off all my birds in 1885, I received #16 for the original pair, or
only&apos;&apos; #\ less than I paid for them ; and, besides this, for ten
years I reaped the profit from the sale of eggs not required for
hatching purposes."
An attempt was made to acclimatize Budgerigars, in a wild
state, at Castle O'er ; a dozen birds w T ere obtained and put into a
cage which was placed on a table below a tree growing on the
lawn. On a branch of the tree a bell was hung, which was rung
when the birds were fed. Eventually&apos; the cage was opened and
the birds allowed their liberty&apos;. The bell was sounded whenever
seed was placed on the table, and so long as they&apos;remained in the
neighbourhood they never failed to answer the summons.
For some months all went well, until one day&apos; the whole
flock took their departure and were never seen again.
Limitation of space forbids of a longer notice of this book ;
we can only advise our members to obtain it forthwith, and study
it for themselves.

Sir,--I n the September number of the Magazine E. Dyson's
attractive little book on "Bird Keeping" is mentioned, and the list of
average prices of birds at the time of publication is copied.
It is perhaps worth while to rectify the erroneous statement that this
book is at least thirty-seven years old, and that therefore the price list
refers to the year 1868 or even a more remote period.
I have before me a copy of this book, the preface of which is dated
July, 1878, On [the fly-leaf is written, "With the Author's compts." I
remember receiving it from the Author with whom I had some correspon-
dence about birds at the time. I was under the impression that the Author
was an Authoress, i.e. a Miss D3&apos;son, but my uienior)&apos; may be at fault, as I
never met Miss Dyson or Mr. Dyson personally.
The book mentions the "Violet-eared Finch " which was then iu my
possession, and had been referred to iu one of Dr. Russ's publications of
that time.
I11 his book on " Exotic Finches," published by Dr. Russ in 1S79, the
little book ou " Bird Keeping," by C. E. Dyson, is mentioned as then
recently published in Loudon.

It is truh&apos; surprising to see the great fall which has occurred in the
market prices of foreign cage birds since 1878. Aug. F. Wiener.
[As our Publisher had stated that the book was at least 37 years old,
we forwarded Mr. Wiener's letter to him, and he replies as follows :
"I11 reply to Mr. Wiener's letter, the date given by me of 'at least
37 years old ' is quite correct, the authority from which I took this when I
forwarded it to Dr. Butler, was the dated autograph of the previous owner,
he had written Nov. 1868.
If Mr. Wiener will refer to the "English Catalogue of Books" he
will also find it recorded there as published by Warne in 1868, price 1/-.
There is no clue to the writer.
Dyson's book on the same subject went into two (or more) editions,
the first being in 1878, price 1/6, the second 1879, price 3/6, of course there
is the chance that Dyson (I can find 110 evidence whether this author was a
lady or gentleman), may have been responsible for the work of 186S, it
would be interesting to know if the price list of birds appeared in Dyson's
book and if so whether the prices varied or were simply copied from the
earlier list.
In November, 1900, Mr. Wiener wrote in the Avicultural Magazine
" Gould's book on Australian Birds was not to be had at that time (20
years previously) for less than sixty or eighty guineas," in 18S0 this work
complete was catalogued at ^175, and even now in two recent catalogues is
marked ^150.
Mr. Wiener's remarks about Cassell's " Canaries and Cage Birds " on
p. 259 would lead one to think that this work was dated, but I do not
remember ever seeing a dated copy."
Dr. Butler also writes to much the same effect.-- Ed.]
THE AGE TO WHICH BIRDS LIVE.
Sir,--I purchased a pair of Magpie-Mannikins in 1S96 which were
exhibited later at the Crystal Palace, but were beaten by two cocks exhibited
as a pair in the next cage : some three or four years later the lieu died, but
the cock continued in good health until about the 15th of August, 1905,
when he began to mope about 011 the floor: he died on the morning of
the 19th.
This bird must therefore have lived for quite ten years.

THE CRIMSON-BREASTED GROSBEAK.
Sir, --Mr. Hamlyn has lately brought back from West Africa a pair of
these interesting birds, which have since been deposited at the Zoological
Gardens, Regent's Park,;where however one died within a day or two of its
arrival.
This very handsome and interesting species has of late years been
very rarely seen on the bird market, whilst I had several opportunities to
purchase specimens between 1874 and 1S7S.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
The bird is of powerful build, about the size of a Russian Bullfinch,
the body is a rich black, whilst the chest is deep crimson. The beak is
dark blue edged with crimson.
A bird of the same family and identical colouring, but with bright
white spots on the black lower part of its body was frequently believed to
be a different species of the same genus.
On referring to my old papers I find that I had a good deal of cor-
respondence about these birds in 1S7S with my friend the late Dr. Carl Russ
of Berlin.
I find that I reported to Dr. Russ in 1S78 that I had lost a Red-breasted
Grosbeak without spots, and that as I was uncertain about its sex I had
sent the body to the "British Ornithological Union" for dissection (Mr.
Gill was then probably not yet practising). It was found that my Grosbeak
without spots was a male.
When I subsequently obtained a Red-breasted Grosbeak without
spots and one with spots, the) 7 built a nest together, though I did not
observe their pairing, nor did I obtain any eggs. But when I put an
additional supposed male into the aviary, furious combats ensued and I had
to take out the second spotless (male) individual very quickly to save its life.
Though these birds came from a ver-y hot region, they proved fairly
hardy when once acclimatised. They are quiet and rather retiring birds,
who love to spend much of their time in a leafy bush. I found them not
nearly so quarrelsome as their powerful frame and their rather loud highly
ornamental colouring would lead one to expect. As food I gave them
millet and Canary seed, with some spray millet and half-a-dozen mealworms
daily, which they seemed to me to require. With this treatment their
plumage soon became perfect, although in winter the temperature of my
aviary sometimes fell to between 40 and 50* Falir.
The colouring of immature birds is dark brown. I believe the two
birds brought home by Mr. Hamlyu to be fully developed males.
The late Dr. Russ called the Red-breasted Grosbeak without spots
Spennestes hceniatina, and the spotted kind (believing it to be another
species of the same genus) Spennestes luchsi. Other writers give this Gros-
beak the following names: Spermophaga cyannorhyncha, Spennospi~a
hceniatina, Loxia hceniatina, Fringilla punctulata, Loxia guttata, Sper-
niospiza guttata, etc., which will show that some simplification of Zoo-
logical nomenclature would be welcome, if it could be brought about.

memories which on a search of my records resulted in the discovery of the
following note:
15 th Oct., 1S96. "Observed that White-throated Finches were feed-
ing one young one, which seemed nicely strong."
I have no further note on the subject, but I have a distinct recollec-
tion that the youngster was then out of the nest and ultimately became an
entirely independent citizen of the aviary. I did not think the event of
any more interest at the time than if the young bird had been a Zebra
Finch or a Cut-throat, hence I took no more note of it. The race has
become extinct in our aviary, and I have not thought it worth while to
replace the birds at the ordinary market price. I may add that they proved
to be hardy in a well sheltered garden aviaiy.
I have had Cordon-bleus hatch young ones which they failed to
bring up, and have had a nest of six strong healthy St. Helena Waxbills
come out in fine condition. Both these occurred some years ago. Our
birds have not done so well lately. Chas. L. RoTheua.

Sir, --In the September issue of Bird Notes, Dr. Creswell at last gives
the description of the Wild Canary, elaborated from the British Museum
Catalogue of Birds, and again states that there is 110 mention of green.
Prof. Newton in his "Dictionary of Birds," p. 71, says "The wild
stock is of an olive-green, mottled with dark brown above, and greenish-
yellow beneath," while Mr. Astley (from whom Dr. Creswell has also quoted)
writing in the Avicultural Magazine, New Ser., Vo] I., p. 48, remarks "and
a very pretty sight and sound it is to see perhaps hundreds of these little
greenish-grey birds sitting on the still bare stems of a large fig-tree amongst
the wild desert-like ground."
Seebolim, Hist, of Brit. Birds, Vol. 2, p. Si, gives the description as
follows, " It has the crown yellowish-green, narrowly streaked with blackish
brown ; the feathers of the back and upper tail-coverts are blackish brown,
broadly margined with grey, and marked with olive-green; forehead and
rump bright yellowish-green; wing-coverts blackish brown, tipped and
margined with olive-green ."
All three of the authorities quoted above distinctly mention green in
the colouration of the bird, and I should think that if Dr. Creswell will
compare them with the Museum Catalogue description even the apparent
discrepancy would be found not to exist. Scarcely any two people describe
colours exactly the same, and for this reason a great number now refer to
Ridgw&apos;ay's " Nomenclature of Colours" when writing a description, and I
imagine that ashy-brown washed with yellow and asliy&apos;-brown washed with
olive yellow, etc., as given in his description w r ould give a result which nine
persons out of ten would describe as olive-green.

In Saunders' "Manual," 2ud ed., p. 178, is a note "there was a
'Citril Finch' taken alive 011 Oct. 14th, (at Brighton 1886), but on examina-
tion the bird proved to be a freely-imported South African species, Serinus
canicollis, another specimen of which has since been captured"; and as
Dr. Creswell says one of his birds was described as a " Citril Finch " and
was also caught at Brighton, there is a chance of his having had a specimen
of the Cape instead of the true " Wild Canary." Onlooker.
Sir, --Allow me to express my thanks to my anonymous friend for his
correction, the result of evidently much research.
I fully agree with him as to the importance attaching to errors in the
dates touching the appearance of books published in the 16th century, and
will draw the attention of Professor Newton [Dictionary of Birds] and my
other authorities to the matter.
But my thanks are more especially due to him for those various
quotations from Turner and others, which so effectually confirm what I
said in my article.
Researches of all kinds are particular!} 7 fascinating. Acting on a
hint kindly given to me lately, I am myself engaged in one which promises
to be of great interest to bird keepers when time and opportunity serve for
publication.
Please accept my congratulations on the volume just completed.

Si r,--A little more than two years ago I penned the following sen-

" confounded, Tuberculosis is the most frequent, and this too in spite of the
" fact that if even the latter exists at all in birds outside the Gallinaceae,
" which is doubtful, it is exceedingly rare." This I say to-day, and I have
twice challenged Mr. J. G. Mylan to demonstrate a case of tuberculosis in a
cage bird that has not been deliberately inoculated for the purpose.
After the inspired statement in Cage Birds of June 24 that he had
been " making some experiments with the microscope in connection with
"certain statements made by him on the subject of birds contiacting such
"diseases as typhoid, consumption, and diphtheria," and that the "result"
would be published in your July number,--after your publication of these
said results,--and after his deliberate statements made to me in letters
direct, I am justified in expecting this demonstration at his hands.
But this is not to be. Although in making such definite declarations
in both public and private, he is taking the position of a scientific investi-
gator, and although he knows well that, if as such he is to command the
slightest attention, he is bound to offer at least some attempt at proof of

the conclusions he advertises, when called upon to do so, he nevertheless
retires at once on my first challenge. In doing so he says that if Nocard,
Villemin, and Hewlett fail to convince me that "Avian Tuberculosis does
exist amongst birds " (sic), I must excuse him from trying to do so.
Well, my statement, published more than two years ago and repeated
in this letter, shews how much I want convincing on the mere point of
its existence.
In Mr. Janies G. Mylan&apos;s July letter of results,--the one ushered in
by his trumpet blast in Cage Birds-- he deliberately quotes Nocard as
follows--words and punctuation marks and all. " Tuberculosis is a common
" disease among birds: the bacilli are a little longer than those met with in
" Tuberculosis Mammalia, otherwise they have the same characteristics,
"react in the same way to the same stains, and flourish on the same
" culture media, but the}&apos; are more vigorous and grow more quickly and
" abundantly."
It is hardly to be expected that any of your readers have taken the
trouble to buy Nocard's book, but if they have, they will be astonished.
Nocard never wrote that sentence. It is one mamifachired by Mr. James G.
Mylan himself out of fragments (and garbled ones at that) of four different
sentences on two different pages of Nocard's book ! Nocord never said
"Tuberculosis is a common disease among birds " : This is what he says,
and I italicize the essential words left out by Mr. Mylan in his gallant
attempt on behalf of his party. "Tuberculosis is a common disease among
the birds of the poultiy yard, ." Then in the next sentence he
goes on to say "It attacks poultry, pigeons, turkeys, peafowl, guinea fowl,
etc. ; and even the small biids take it experimentally ." So we see that after
all it is Mr. James G. Mylan who requires convincing by Professor Nocard,
because in order to make use of him as a support for himself in his attitude
of bluff and conceit he is obliged to falsify him. When I challenge this
fellow medical man of mine to demonstrate tuberculosis in a cage bird not
specially inoculated for the purpose, it will be seen that although
incidentally I may yet be found to differ with Nocard in some directions, I
am entirely in accord with him in this one; and that to insinuate the
contrary in the manner he has is simple dishonesty on Mr. Mylan's part.
After this exhibition of Mr. Mylan&apos;s method of conducting a scientific
discussion we need not feel surprised to find further on in his manufactured
"quotation" that Nocard's words "generally seem" are boldly altered
into "are." This is done, not once, but twice in this "quotation" of Nocard,
in which he is made to say that which he never said and never meant to say,
in order to bolster up my opponent in his presumption and ignorance of
the subject.
It is now of course a work of supererogation on my part,--more than
that--it is an act of condescension for me to challenge Mr. Mylan again ;
but still I do so for the third and last time. If he elects to give the

demonstration which we are justified in expecting, but of which I more than
doubt his ability, I shall certainly now take no part in it, although I shall be
present; but I have to-day (October 4th) arranged that it can take place in
the bacteriological laboratory where I am engaged in still further elucidating
this spurious tuberculosis, which is so common in most species of cage
birds and indeed in poultry, etc. as well. It is the laboratory of (Professor)
Hewlett himself.
If your readers will refer to my last letter on this subject (September)
they will realize the grave issues which hang on it, and will see in whom
their real friend is to be found.
W. Geo. Cresweee.
P.S.--I forgot to say that for the third time I challenge anybody to
demonstrate, etc.

become too heated and personal, is closed. Ed.].

MUTATIONS IN BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99896184" page_id="32720433"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
Through the courtesy of Prof. W. E. D. Scott, I have just had
the pleasure of studying a most interesting paper recently published by
him in the new series of 'Science,' Vol. XXII., No. 557, pp. 271-282 (Sept.
1st, 1905)--" On the probable origin of certain birds."
The article treats of nine supposed species from North America and
one from Southern Europe; and from the fact that seven of these are
either only known from individual types or from illustrations, he regards
them as probably mutations from known species which have failed to
establish themselves as permanent distinct species.
The two other North American species appear to be on the increase;
and, from the evidence of field-naturalists are proved to be, in Prof. Scott's
opinion, separate and distinct mutations from a common parent stock.
The European species (Athene chiaradece ) is also regarded as an
instance of neogenesis and not of teratological or pathological origin.
I11 my "Foreign Finches in Captivity" it will be remembeied that I
expressed the opinion (p. 178) that the Red-lieaded race of the Gouldian
finch was a mutation from the Black-headed race and was 011 the increase
owing to the preference shown by the hens of both types for the Red-
headed males, and that eventually the Black-lieaded race would become
extinct. Recent evidence furnished by breeders is entirely favourable to
this view; black-lieaded parents producing young with red heads. Un-
fortunately, owing to the tendency 7 of the hens to egg-binding, successes in
breeding this species in captivity are not so frequent as in the case of some
other Australian finches, but much may be done by keeping the birds onl\ r
in open air aviaries.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
This year I purchased two pairs of Gouldian finches, one of the
Black-headed type ( Poephila goutdice), the other of the Red-headed type
(P. mirabilis.) I turned P. mirabilis 3 and P. goutdice ? into an indoor
aviary, and the other two into an outdoor one: indoors the hen became egg
bound and died, was replaced by a second hen which also died, no nest
having been completed. Outside P. goutdice 3 and P. mirabilis ? built in
an old straw hat nailed against the wall but failed to hatch ; later they
again went to nest in the same receptacle, and early in September I heard
young birds. As the weeks passed without young appearing and both old
birds were frequently seen flying freely about the aviary I concluded that
the young had died, but early in October I again heard them, and on the
9th two young ones were flying about perfectly feathered but. in the young
plumage, though showing a blackish mask round the base of the beak. It
will be interesting to see whether, when they moult, these birds will be
Red- or Black-headed Gouldians. A. G. BUTTER.

was a lien].

by the escape of pus from an abscess in the abdominal walls into the
abdominal cavity. There was nothing contagious, but in all probability
the abscess was the result of an injury].

Shamah. (Mrs. Stanvforth). [Your bird died of apoplexy].
Javan ParrakeETS (2). Mrs. L. Sturtou Johnson). [Both birds died of
inflammation of the liver. This disease is common in newly imported
birds. The fact that your friend's birds are healthy and well bears out my
experience, viz., that for all hardy birds like most of the Parrakeets
there is nothing to equal large aviaries out of doors. Some folks say it
is cruel to keep them out, but I have tried this as well as the indoor
treatment and find it far more successful.
Gouldian Finch and Masked PTnch. (Miss Gladstone). [Both these
birds died of pneumonia. You do not say by what means the aviary is
heated, as this may have something to do with the cause of the
pneumonia.]
Hen Rufous-tailed Finch. (Mr. Cummings). [The bird died of
peritonitis].
Rufous-tailed Grassfinch and Green Singing Finch. (Mrs.
Robertson). [Both birds died of pneumonia and I quite think your

THE REGENT BIRD.
Sericulus melinus (Cat. B. Brit. Mus. VI., p. 395 .J
By Reginald Phillipps.
In connection with the fourth Congress of the Australasian
Ornithologists' Union, a visit was made, apparently in December,
1904, to the Tuggerah Rakes in New South Wales, situated about
60 miles north of Sydney ; an account of the excursion appeared
in the Emit for July last; and, at p. 4, Mr. J. W. Mellor, a member
of the Union and of the excursion, wrote as follows :--" In the
afternoon another direction was taken, to a piece of virgin scrub
where the sleeper-cutter's axe had laid low many forest giants.
Our trip here was almost expressly to try and get a glimpse of
the Regent Bird (Sericulus melinus), and, after spending some
time in vain clambering through thick undergrowth and tangle,
we were just giving up to return when quite a covey was observed
in a very tall tree. In a minute or two the birds had dispersed,
being very shy, but after a little circumvention we were able to
get nearer and observe them ; we were, however, unable to get a
specimen, owing to the exceedingly high trees that they persisted
in occupying." Even in Eastern Australia, the home of the
Regent (South Queensland and New South Wales), the species is
still regarded with great interest, and much remains to be learnt
about it. In captivity the bird seems to have done better with
me than with others. Moreover, one of my females has presented
me with a couple of bonny bairns, a remarkable occurrence.
I say advisedly "presented me for very much more credit, at
any rate for the bringing up, is due to me than to that gay

Mr. R. Phillipps,
deceiver the old male. The following notes about the species
may therefore be of interest and not wholly without value.
So far as I have been able to observe, aviculturists, at any
rate in this country, have not been very successful with the
Regent Bird. Since 1867, examples have been arriving at the
London Zoological Gardens from time to time; and private
individuals have occasionally been exhibiting the male at the
Bird Shows. In January, 1903, a good many were brought over
--their last arrival I think--and the country was as it were
flooded with them. What has become of all these birds? Only
one female survived when I visited the Gardens in June last; and
with the exception of this bird and those in my own possession I
do not know of one, although of course there may be others un-
known to me.
Remarkably interesting as the Satin Bower-bird undoubt-
edly is (VII., 136-7; N.S.&apos;I., p. 63), and as the Spotted Bower-
bird probably is likewise, a few years ago I cleared both species
out of my aviary in order to make way for the Regent. The
former two species bullied the latter and other inmates of the
aviary, the latter seemed unquestionably to be the more desirable
bird, and so it came to pass that, not having room for the others,
of recent years I have clung to the Regent alone--and I have
never had occasion to repent my choice.
It is not often one meets with a more handsome bird than
an adult male Regent, the brilliancy of the yellow, the richness
of the orange, and the unsurpassed depth of the velvety black
forming a striking combination. So intensely black are the
under parts that it (the black) seems to offer no resistance to the
eye, somehow one's look goes into it as into the darkness of
night, the brain fails to perceive it. The female, too, with her
simple brown honey-comb marked dress is neat and trim. But
the attractive character of the species is not based on the
plumage alone, nor even chiefly. It is a bird of much character,
its ways and habits are exceptionally interesting, its movements
are quaint and curious, and its manner of courting absurdly
fantastic. A healthy Regent in a roomy place must play the fool,
and if it has not a fellow to play the fool with it will play the

fool with some other bird, with a stone, a projecting stick, any-
thing. It is never so happy as when making itself ridiculous.
Moreover the Regent, in addition to its many and varied
calls, has quite a pleasing little song; squatting in some sheltered
corner, softly and sweetly he will warble away for quite a long
time ; and he is no mean mimic. On September 4 last, I caught
my second female singing like the male.
The Regent is not a cage-bird ; it is quite out of place in a
cage or small aviary ; but in a large natural garden aviary, with
proper protection during the cold season, it is about as nice a
species as one can have. It is remarkably intelligent, and will
become very tame if nicely treated. Another very important
point in its favour is that it is usually quite amiable with other
birds. Unfortunately it is uncertain in its temper with members
of its own species ; and when once two males come to blows
there is nothing for it but to shut up one of them, and it may be
weeks or even months before he can again be enlarged in the
general aviary; and in a confined space even two females cannot
be relied upon to keep the peace.
The Regent Bird must not be over exposed to cold; the
protracted moult when it is in the open air speaks volumes in
this connection.
Moreover, great care must be taken with the food, or it will
have fits. The more I know of the bird the more I am satisfied
that, in confinement, it should be fed chiefly upon a fruit and
vegetable diet. Even with fruit one must be careful. For instance,
one autumn I threw some unripe, perhaps exceptionally hard and
unripe, grapes into the aviary, and two of the Regents were
seized with severe fits. One lingered a few weeks, the other for
a twelvemonth, but the grapes were the original cause of death
in each case. Doubtless it is a more delicate and a more difficult
*species to keep in confinement than the Satin-bird.
It very freely eats the leaves of growing trees, and care
must be taken that no injurious ones are planted in the aviarv.
It will be seen by-and-by how serious the results may be if there
be any thoughtlessness in this respect.
Indeed the Regent is a very bad forester, for it is inces-
santly plucking the leaves off some trees and taking bites out of

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
the more palatable leaves of others. So much damage does it do
to budding trees and shrubs and sprouting seeds that it is ruin to
the garden to allow it to enter in the spring until the vegetation
is well established, and this has been a hindrance to breeding.
Now it has been proved that it will breed in artificial structures,
which hitherto I had supposed to be unlikely, one will know
better how to act in the future.
Although very fond of tubbing, and a good tubbing too in
warm weather, after rain these birds will flounder about like
walruses, in a violent and noisy manner, amongst the wet foliage
of thick trees.
The bill and eyes of the adult male are bright yellow, the
entire upper parts of head, neck, and upper mantle of a brilliant
orange-yellow, deepening on the crown into reddish orange ; and,
when the wings are closed and braced up, a large bright yellow
shield appears above, formed by the primaries and secondaries,
most of which are of this* colour but with the ends, &amp;c., black.
It might be supposed that such a brilliantly attired bird
could be seen at any time when confined within the limits of an
aviary, but this is far from being the case. He is preternaturally
self-conscious, instinctively feels his danger and keeps much to
the thick undergrowth, frequently cannot be seen even when not
particularly hiding, is ever alert and watchful, and scents peril
in everybody and everything ; nevertheless he is self-possessed,
and neither flies into a panic nor loses his head. For instance, a
visitor comes to see the birds ; unless I have previously taken
measures, and especially if a strange voice be raised as we
approach, that visitor will not see the male Regent. But it occa-
sionally happens that he is in a favourite "house" close to the
entrance door, and cannot regain natural covert without flying
in front of us; and if we have entered the aviary on the quiet
he is "cornered." Instantly (for there is possible danger in an
artificial enclosure) he sneaks out on to a small perch in a near
corner, carefully keeping some dead "trees" between himself
and us. While on the move, the glint of his yellow garments
betrays him, for he is close by, and I point him out to the
visitor. In a moment he has reached the perch, put himself
into position, and is lost to view although only some twelve feet

distant. Out of sight out of mind, some other bird attracts
our attention for the moment--and I look towards the spot
where he had been but he has vanished. He had been in a
sort of cul-de-sac, we had been standing at the entrance, and
yet he had got clear away without attracting the attention of
either of us. Now he would have had to fly some sixteen feet
before he could get round the corner of the house, passing close
behind us, and another seventeen feet before gaining the shelter
of the birdroom ; and yet so cunningly does he go off that he
hardly ever betrays himself.
If this be the nature of a bird which has been over six
years in my possession, and which with me is tame, how much
more may we not expect these traits to be accentuated in the
character of the wild male! And may we not have a clue here
to the alleged scarcity of fully feathered males compared with
the number of those which are observed, or supposed to be
observed, in immature feather?
To digress a little. May not the supposed rarity of fully
black Satin-birds be accounted for in a similar manner ? Mr. Re
Souef says (Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds , p. 192), "It is,
therefore, evident that the birds only come to their full plumage
in old age, and that accounts for the fact that in a flock of say
one hundred birds, which we often used to see at Gembrook,
some years ago, there would be only a very few, not half-a-dozen
black ones among them. They die off shortly after the change."
As I inferred in May, 1901, Mr. Le Souef's hypothesis is difficult
of acceptance. The male Satin-bird is bold, and with me did
not instinctively hide away after the manner of the male Regent;
nevertheless he is a tricky cunning bird, his blue-black plumage
very readily lends itself to concealment either in bush or scrub ;
and it is much more probable that the black birds lie close after
a manner like to that about to be related of the Regent than to
suppose (to quote Dr. A. G. Butler) that they " put on black
clothing in preparation for their own funerals."
To state the case a little bluntly, however it may be with
the Satin-bird, the fully feathered male Regent is comparatively
rarely seen for the simple reason that he is far cleverer than are
the ruthless specimen collectors who seek to murder him for the

Mr. R. Phillipps,
sake of his skin, and does not choose to betray his presence
except now and then on occasions when he is practically safe
amongst the topmost branches of the highest trees. The females
and immature males may at times be easily approached.
When the adult male Regent wishes to conceal himself, he
mounts to the highest available perch in some shady corner*
fluffs out his body feathers, draws his head well in, remains
absolutely still, and then he is moderately invisible even in my
little aviary--and knows it. All of the underparts are of that
unfathomable darkness already mentioned which offers no resist-
ance to the human eye; and consider how this must be in the
" Haunt of the Regent Bird," of which Mr! Campbell gives ns an
illustration in his Nests a?id Eggs ! Directly he flies, however,
the bright yellow of the flights gleams in the shade of the bush
like a flash of light; and doubtless it is from this circumstance
that the bird has gained from the black fellows of Australia the
name of Yelgun, or the sun (A 7 ! &amp; E., p. 211).
From time to time it is brought to my notice that not a
few aviculturists have the idea that a male Regent comes into and
goes out of colour annually, after the manner of Bishops, Blue
Wrens, &amp;c., but this is a mistake. The male Regent, like the
male Satin-bird, takes some few years to attain mature plumage,
but when once the full feather has been donned it is retained
summer and winter until death.
And how long does it take the male Regent to obtain the
full feather of the adult ? Mr. Campbell says,--"The youthful
male resembles the female ; the second year the bill is yellowish ;
the third or fourth year the plumage is complete." This in the
main tallies with my experiences ; with me, however, the yellow
bill has not been obtained until a comparatively late period. In
some examples the irides became yellow before any other part,
but in others yellow, but not black, appeared first on one or two
of the wing feathers. Here we must bear in mind that the feather
bearing the yellow patch may be an early visitor thrown out to
replace one which has been prematurely lost. And it must be a
real patch, not a simple wash of yellow which may often be seen
near to the shaft of a flight in the wing of a female, usually on
the inner web alone. More than once this } r ellow on the wings

of my present females has led me astray, but it is not a permanent
colour.
As regards my old male (my third) I may repeat what I
said in our Magazine in May, 1901 (VII., p. 139) :--" My present
bird, when received 011 the 4th August, 1899, had just a little
yellow on the wings. During the moult of that autumn, he put
on a trifle more yellow but no black. In July, 1900, he com-
menced growing a few yellow and black flights; and during the
autumn his bill became yellower, and the head assumed a faint
wash of the same colour. Judging by my earlier specimens and
this bird, and others I have seen, I think that the Regent either
takes a longer period to come into full colour than Mr. Campbell
supposes, or else that the due development of the colour is
greatly retarded by the coldness of our climate, or the adverse
influences of a life in captivity." This bird completed the adult
plumage in October, 1901. But what was his age when he
reached my hands ? Judging by other examples, he could hardly
have been less than rising two, otherwise he must have been
hatched say in January, 1899, and have commenced to put on
colour when some seven months old. So far as I have been able
to observe, this could not have been the case, for males in
" female " plumage (unless I am greatly mistaken) have reached
this country which vmst have been hatched a full twelve-month
previously.
Let us trace up another specimen. I11 January, 1903, I re-
ceived an immature but well advanced male, so advanced in
plumage that at the least he must have been a year older than
the old male was at the time he came into my hands. He could
not have been less than two years old. In the autumn of that
year he became more yellow but not much more. He w r as in
perfect health all through the moult, the fit previously referred to
not occurring until October 23. A year later he became more
black and a little more yellow, but was far from being in the full
plumage of the adult when he died on November 5, 1904. I then
found, according to my notes made at the time, that the tail
" seemed new and perfect but was not black." The flights had
all been more or less renewed ; and it is most improbable that
the old 1903 tail, which had borne the brunt of the fit, could have

Mr. R. Philpipps,
remained perfect, and that not a single feather had been renewed
or even cast during the moult. The 1904 tail then being brown,
the bird, if he had lived, would not have come into colour until
this autumn, unless twelve months of doubtful health hindered
the proper development of colour. I11 the latter case one might
have supposed that at any rate some of the tail feathers would
have shown signs of black. I think it will be moderately safe to
say that in this country the male Regent does not obtain full
feather until he is about four years old or possibly not until he is
rising five.
The question is somewhat affected by the difference that
seems to exist between the time of the year during which they
moult respectively in Australia and in this country. In Australia
presumably the moulting follows the breeding season, say Feb-
ruary--April. My Regents have frequently fallen into moult in
May, but then it has usually dragged on, not becoming decided
until about the third weelcjn July, finishing towards the middle
or end of October. Often they do not commence before July,
completing in October or November.
I have found, too, that different individuals occasionally
come into colour differently, each one following a line of his own.
I suspect that this may be accounted for by the birds being im-
ported at various ages, and thus having had a longer or shorter
period to develop in Australia before being affected by the voyage
and our cold climate.
The early commencement of and the often protracted
moult, and the general difficulty the species experiences in
adapting itself to onr seasons, are formidable obstacles in the way
of its breeding in this country. I11 Australia the breeding season
is November--January. In this country it regards our com-
paratively cool summer as winter and towards its close prepares
for breeding, but is stopped by the increasing cold and shortening
days. To put it another way ; the season when the Regents,
both male and female, are most active with their bowers and
love-parlours is also their season of moult, which is ridiculous
upon the face of it.
In January, 1903, I received five Regents within a few days
of their arrival in this country. When handled, I noticed a

possible sign of sex which I mention for what it may be worth.
Three squealed and two were mute; and certainly the three
squealers were the most quarrelsome. Owing to scarcity of
accommodation, these birds had to be moved about and mixed
together, and I was unable (being otherwise much occupied) to
follow closely the changes which took place in each individual,
or always to be quite sure of the identity of a particular bird.
One of the five died from the effects of the journey, a second was
the immature male (one of the squealers) just referred to, the
sexes of the other three being uncertain--we now know that at
any rate two were females. Whether because of our cold dark
climate, or of the inability of the species to readily conform to
our seasons, I cannot say, but these three sported phases of plu-
mage from time to time, transitory it is true but well marked while
they lasted,which were very misleading. One developed the yellow
irides of the male, but the yellow was not permanent, and slowly
darkened into brown once more. Two of them, then supposed
to be males--perhaps they were the two surviving females, put on
quite a considerable amount of yellow on the face crown nape
and hind-neck, but chiefly around the brown-black crown-patch,
but this yellow phase did not last. Could all of these three have
been females? In any case, may we not here have another ex-
planation of the alleged scarcity of fully adult males? It may be
that many of the wild Regents which are taken to be immature
males are actually females ; and it is not unlikely that there are
more females than males.
The behaviour this last summer of all of my three Regents
seemed to point to the species being polygamous, and, if the
Regent, probably also the Satin-bird (see Mrs. Johnstone's
account, in the December, 1902, issue, of the behaviour of the
father of her young Satin-birds), and, if the Satin-bird, why not
the Bower-birds generally ? Of course these are only sugges-
tions, thrown out in order that others may watch as they may
have opportunity, and confirm or reject as further data may
become available.
The Bower-birds, so far as I know them, are gregarious, I
might say clannish ; no bird has a good word for an individual

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
of another species, but each takes a sort of family interest in the
sayings and doings of those of its own clan.
But it cannot be that they breed promiscuously. It would
be grievous to think that the Regent could ever sink to the level
of Molothrus ; and we know that the female attends to her own
eggs and young. The devotion of my mother Regent was almost
phenomenal; and even now that the surviving youngster is
almost as an old bird the bond of union between the two is a good
and pleasant thing to behold. But may not this consuming fire in
the breast of the female eventually burn itself out, and the
mother, after the lapse of generations, worn out in providing food
for the young--small wonder that the normal number is but two
--and, perhaps, in some seasons or when growing feeble, actually
unable to provide a sufficiency, be tempted one day to drop her
egg into the nest of some other bird and so in course of time
become parasitic? Peradveuture the Bower-birds have saved the
situation by reducing the clutch from some higher number to
its present sober dimensions. All the Bower-birds, Cat-birds
(. EEluroedus ), and I may include the Rifle-birds, seem to lay--
some only one egg, the more part two, a few occasionally three
as a maximum number. I observe that Mr. Campbell's Nests and
Eggs mentions at page 1074 that the female Rifle-bird seems to
do all the work of attending to the nest without assistance from
the male ; and probably the same rule prevails among the Bower-
birds and Rifle-birds generally.
The Regent Bird, in our cold climate, is not so industrious
a builder of bowers as the Satin-bird, and is most busy in our
autumn, the Australian spring; and the best bowers are con-
structed in very secluded spots, carefully hidden away under the
thickest undergrowth, and will be repaired and resorted to year
after year if still well concealed, and if not ruined by bad weather,
for a sodden bower disgusts the Regent ; unlike the Satin-bird,
the old male will not place a true bower under a shed or in the
open. Should its shelter be impaired or removed from any cause,
it would be deserted and shortly pulled to pieces. It is a much
smaller affair than that of the Satin-bird.
As I pointed out in May, 1901, the bowers built by my
birds usually had a saucer-like "nest" in the centre of the so-

called run, in which they placed their treasures. Of late years
the}^ have not often reproduced this form--little b) 7, little but very
surely birds lose many of their natural habits in captivity, they
seem to get lazy ; but my birds pretty regularly keep up the old
custom in a very inconvenient manner. Many of the food dishes
are round garden saucers ; and these, especially in cold weather
or when the bowers have been spoilt by rain, are accepted as ex-
cellent substitutes and are occasionally more or less filled up
with stones or otherwise adorned. Smooth round stones about
the size of a small marble are the favourites, and these may be
seen in the birds' bills as they fly in a bee-line from garden to
birdroom. Green leaves, but never any but those which have
just been plucked, are likewise occasionally made use of.
The ordinary bowers are used more frequently by the
males, not as "runs," but for the purpose of showing off before
one or several females perched close by and above them. In this
again we see how fully birds understand and set due value ou the
position and nature of the colours of their own feathers. Viewed
from below, only dense black is exposed to the sight, so they
perch high when desiring to conceal themselves. Viewed from
above, rich orange and brilliant yellow meet the eye, and
so, when the male wants to display before his females, down to
the ground he goes and there disports himself. If displaying
elsewhere the rule holds good, for he bows his head to the level
of the perch, so as to show off the orange and yellow of head
and back. As they go through their extraordinary dances and
performances, they constantly look back over their shoulder,
backwards and upwards, as if appealing to their ladyloves with a
" Wasn't that fine? " kind of air ; and all the time be it remem-
bered they are clattering and chattering in an idiotic manner in
low and subdued tones.
The bowers of the females are different. Last year, if I
remember rightly, in private letters I referred to these as a new
kind of bower constructed by the males. I gladly avail myself
of this opportunity of correcting myself:--the individuals which
I at the time thought must be males have turned out to be
females. That this form of bower should never have been con-
structed before I can account for only by supposing that my two

Mr. R. Philupps,
females had not previously been sufficiently mature. These
love-parlours, each one built by a female for her sole use , rather
in the open and not far apart, and each most jealously guarded
by its fair owner, were of the shape of a horse-shoe magnet but
with the sides equidistant throughout their entire length, open
only at one end, and inside of about the same length and breadth
as the bird, the top of the barricade being about on a level with
the back of the squatting female, the sticks, woven together,
being laid flat, none upright. The female would enter and squat
in her love-parlour, the tail remaining towards the entrance,
whilst a male, with every imaginable and unimaginable contor-
tion, accompanied by a continuous discharge of (vocal) fire-arms,
would make rushes and furious (feigned) assaults on the front of
the breastwork, the female sitting in a lump and not moving a
muscle. Every now and again, however, the male would slyly
work round to the rear and tweak the tip of the female's tail.
This advance, at any tin;e perhaps but the very earl}^ morning,
or at any rate while I was looking on, was not considered correct,
and the female would slowly turn her head with what we will
suppose was an icy look of grave disapproval. The second
female, as I may call her, (in the autumn of 1904) was the most
energetic, and her fortress became a really formidable structure,
the parapet being raised pari passzc with the additions to the
platform. Every bird that approached was savagely driven away
with the exception of a female Rain Quail, who sat on her eggs
and brought off her brood scarcely a foot away and w^as never
molested--not until the chicks had come out were the shells
pounced upon. The second female was then courted by the
young male that died later, the breeding female, as I may dis-
tinguish her, by the old male.
This summer and autumn, the birds being sexed with cer-
tainty, I found that the foregoing seemed to be the recognised
*courting arrangement, the selected female, with or without her
protecting barricade, squatting lumpily on the ground, on the
proposed nesting-site, and in the nest itself, while the surviving
male sported before her. On the other hand, the rejected female,
at first favoured but afterwards deserted owing to an accidental
circumstance which will be narrated later, built or partially built

three love-parlours in different spots in her endeavours to bring
back to his allegiance the fickle male.
If there is a superabundance of females, or if the species
be polygamous, these endeavours on the part of the females to
entice the males may be readily understood.
During the summer of 1904, in spite of every encourage-
ment on my part, neither female would nest, and for a time I
concluded they must be males; later in the year, as already
mentioned, they became very enthusiastic over their love-par-
lours--they were completely fogged as regards the seasons.
When they constructed their love-bowers, and extended to their
particular male the invitation " Will you walk into my parlour
they were under the impression that it was a case of--
". . . . the winter is past,
The rain is over and gone;
The flowers appear on the earth ;
The time of the singing of birds is come,
And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land."
The increasing cold of our approaching winter disillusioned them ;
but at any rate the one wise bird treated that simply as a dis-
agreeable episode which compelled a temporary cessation of
castle-building; and, after an unsatisfactory trial in December,
she picked up the thread and went on from where she had
dropped it the previous autumn.
It may be gathered from the foregoing that 1113^ flock of
Regents this summer consisted of an old male and two younger
females. The one female was a large sedate bird, the other a
smaller and very flighty creature ; and it was to the latter that
the male paid suit this spring, and accordingly it was with the
latter that I shut up the.male in the private well wooded aviary
which is reserved every summer for the breeding and other
special birds. But the course of love, true or otherwise, does not
always run smoothly even in a reserved aviary, especially when
one tries to breed several species together ; and this summer the
even tenor of the Regents' way was disturbed in an alarming
almost tragic manner, exemplifying vividly the difficulties
under which the aviculturist labours who has but limited
accommodation.

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
Chera procne (a species which has never yet been adequately de-
scribed or figured), flying loose in aviary and birdroom along with
the Regents and perfectly well known to them. This spring I
secured two supposed females which, with the best male, a mag-
nificent and very strong bird with an unusually full tail, I trans-
ferred to the reserved aviary on May iS. The delight of the
male was unbounded, and words fail to describe his pride, his
arrogant vanity, his glorious display. A stiff wind was blowing
which he faced like a boy's kite, as a Gull or a Rook takes a gale,
rising and falling, sideways and slantwise, advancing and retreat-
ing, up and down, in and out, dancing hither and thither, here
and there and everywhere as, with twelve long streaming and
snake-like tails, black saturnine body so weirdly striped above,
shoulders two blazing flames of fire, with unwearying pertinacity

The inmates of the aviary were panic stricken ; there was a wild
rush, a frantic dash, a sickening crash, a shapeless heap of bat-
tering wings--and with something akin to a choking in my
throat I bore to the house in a firm grip the convulsing body of
the female Regent. She recovered from the fit, and was returned
to the others on June io; but the shock to the system had been
great,--and .there was an end to her nesting for the time being.
The larger female, to whom this male had made advances
during the previous autumn, was at once placed in the reserved
aviary. Last December she had endeavoured for a few days to
hide in a large woodstaclc and remain out all night in the cold,
apparently under the influence of some breeding impulse. In
the early spring I had noticed her more than once flying about
with a twig in her bill: when bower building I do not see them
flying* with a stick; they gather the sticks on the ground and
carry them to their destination by a succession of hops. She
wished to build in a secluded spot which I had prepared with
great care, but the trees so cunningly planted and arranged more
than a year previously failed to come up to expectation in the
matter of foliage and left the spot slightly exposed from one
point, and the Regent, after frequently inspecting finally rejected

on the Regent Bird.
it--and thus my hopes, such as they were, of breeding Regents
during 1905 faded away and were almost forgotten.
On July 20, desiring to investigate something, I entered
the aviary by a door rarely used during the nesting season, and
had not proceeded many paces when I became conscious of a
sound somewhere about me which, although never heard before,
I knew to be the complaint made by a bird who has a nest hard
by. It was a kind of croaking Fieldfare note, but uttered in a
very suppressed ventriloquial tone, Instantly I slunk out of the
aviary, and took up my position at a window from which I could
watch. I found eventually that the female Regent was sitting in
a hamper which I had fixed up in a corner some 8--9 feet from
the ground. It was suitably tilted, had been partly filled by me
with hay, and had a piece of wood fixed across the lower front
which served the double purpose of a perch and of keeping the
hay in position. When I examined the nest after the young had
left I found nothing but the hay, not a twig had been added.
The exact date on which the bird had commenced.to sit I
could not tell. I recalled to mind that I had not seen her much
about for a few days, that the male had been remarkably quiet
and unobtrusive, and that the second female had been betraying
signs of fear and a desire to escape from the reserved aviary.
Moreover, some three days previously, the male and breeding
female had made a murderous assault (I think the male assisted)
on the Mesias, whose oft-commenced nest was in a thorn but a few
feet away. Never before had I known a Regent attempt to inflict
actual bodily harm on any but one of his own species, and it is
probable that the circumstance marked the laying of the first
egg. Two eggs, the usual number, were laid ; and, judging by the
difference between the two young when they left the nest, one
would suppose that there was an interval of a day between the
laying of the eggs and that incubation commenced with the lay-
ing of the first. I think that the period of incubation may be
taken provisionally as 19-20 days.
Whilst the female was sitting, the male at first would mount
guard close to the nest. Before long he was joined by the second
female who, for a time, had been afraid to show herself. Soon,
however, they both cleared off.

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
Regents are naturally gregarious, and, as with some other
gregarious species, the breeding females seem to withdraw for a
season from the general assembly. My breeding female had re-
tired, and for many weeks she and her brood were, in a sense,
isolated. The male ceased to interest himself particularly in
her, and went off with the other female on nesting thoughts
intent. It was through no fault of theirs that they did not
withdraw bodily, for they were perpetually being reminded that
they were within the danger zone. The sitting female was
annoyed by their presence; she regarded them as intruders
within her reservation, and would swoop down upon and dash at
them furiously. She seemed to be inspired and impelled onwards
in her task by some intense fire within her, a fire that lasted until
the middle of October. When she came down from the nest to
the food dishes, she came down like a bolt, with a rush causing so
great a disturbance in the air I could always distinguish between
her approach and that of the other Regents without looking up.
If either Regent or any other bird approached nest or food when
she was about, she went for it and none dared to withstand her,
although as a rule the Regent is a timid, almost a cowardly species.
This fire impelled her to the wildest action, and she dashed about
with great violence ; the reserved aviary was too small for her in
her present excited condition ; and I soon saw that it was neces-
sary to clear the birds out of the general aviary and confine them
in the birdroom, so as to allow her to have the full sweep of the
entire garden--and this was all too little.
The female Regent I should state is as a rule a larger and
more powerful bird than the male; and she has need to be, for to
my female fell the entire work of providing food for the young.
She gave herself up with extraordinary devotion to their welfare,
and had not a thought for the others so long as they kept out of
her way. The male neither sat on the eggs nor helped to feed
the young : he soon ceased to associate with the breeding female
and took up entirely with the second bird.
And to this second female I must turn for a moment. It
so happened that the Burrowing Owls were breeding at this time.
They have a house in the general aviary, and for a great part of
the year play Box and Cox with the other birds. Not wishing

on the Regent Bira.
to disturb this arrangement while they were breeding, I used to
come down every morning at day-break, shut in the Owls, and
throw open the doors between the two aviaries for the benefit of
the Regents. Whilst it was still so dark that I could scarcely
distinguish their forms, I would find the male and second female
sporting together on the ground under one of the sheds. It is,
with Regents as with many species, in the quiet of the early
morning that the real courting goes on. This female was most
anxious to breed. Several times she attempted to slip into the
nest as if to lay but was always most energetically repulsed--that
hamper had a magnetic attraction for her. On August 8 she tried
to establish herself in a box close to the hamper, but it was of no
use, notwithstanding that the male sat close by and warbled away
for some time, presumably in the hope of softening the obdurate
heart of the bird within. After the eggs had been hatched she
endeavoured to feed the young ; and, when the latter left the
nest she, supported by the male, endeavoured to take possession,
but all in vain.
During September a reversal of the natural order of affairs
took place--the male " squatted " and the female played up to
him. Was this because for a while he was ill (poisoned?) and
not progressing with his moult, while his companion on the con-
trary was exceptionally forward and vigorous? Later she, entirely
unaided I think, built a large and elaborate bower inside of
which was a very substantial platform with a depression in the
centre, and in this "nest," such as it was, the male squatted while
the female danced before him. Both birds uttered notes of com-
plaint if I approached too near. On the 30th, the female was
carrying tufts of hay to a well concealed basket; but the cruel
north wind of the two following days drove the whole family of
Regents into the birdroom. On October 3, she carefully hacked
away a fading leaf from a trunk, flew to the ground, picked it up
and carried it off to the woodstack. But nothing could come of
all this ; speaking generally, Regents collapse during the cold of
an English October, and only proceed with their courting spas-
modically according to the weather.
Iu Australia, all would have been so different. The breed-
ing would have been at the proper season, no moulting, no cold;

Mrs. Howard Williams,
there would have been unlimited space and boundless choice of
sites--the pair would have moved far beyond the reach of the
Fury in the hamper, and the second female likewise have laid
two beautiful eggs in some secluded spot.

Munia pectoralis.
By Mrs. Howard Williams.
In the early part of last June Dr. Butler kindly told me
that our member, Mr. Housden, had an enormous number of
Australian birds, which were well worth a visit. Unfortunately
this part of Kent was in the midst of a terrible week of rain, and
the day I went to see the birds was one of the worst in that
wretched week. I did not mean to get any Pectoral Finches,
but somehow I came back with a pair besides the birds I had
intended to add to my number. The Pectorals were so hand-
some, and in such good feather and condition that I simply could
not resist them. Mr. Housden strongly advised me not to put
his birds outside, as they had been kept warm, so, rather
reluctantly these finches were placed in an aviary in the
conservatory, which they shared with a pair of Masked Finches,
a pair of Gouldians, and an odd cock Dong-tailed Grassfiucli.
Very soon the hen disappeared, but at last I caught sight
of her peeping out of a rush basket. After she had sat for an
abnormal time I examined the basket and found a quantity of
eggs, but no young birds. I took away the eggs fearing the
poor bird would get exhausted with her hopeless task, but after a
short rest of a week or so she began to lay again, and when I left
home early in August she was again sitting steadily.
On my return on September nth I found seven baby-birds
in the aviary, but could hardly believe they were one brood.
Evidently the hen must have begun to sit when the first egg was
laid.
Four of the youngsters sat aloft comfortably clothed in
shades of brown, looking very much like magnified young
Bronze-winged Mannikins, but the other three shivered miserably

011 the ground, with backs and thighs completely bare and quite
unable to fly.
The gardener said that they left the nest in twos, with about
two days interval between, and that they had all been as badly
covered at first, but while the four eldest soon improved and flew
up to the perches the three youngest had seemed to make no
progress. Perhaps the colder weather had something to do with
it, or perhaps the parents found it easier to feed the bigger
stronger ones, and kept the wretched three on short commons.
At night they crouched together in a corner till I put in a
travelling cage with a little hay in it, and after I had put them to
bed the first night they gladly found their way into it by them-
selves, and sometimes stayed in it till late in the morning.
About two days after my return the hen was taken ill and
\0x25A0died, and next day the youngest and most naked nestling was
found dead in the bath pan. Fortunately the cock had shared
the business of feeding with the hen, so that the young ones did
not starve, and they were able to feed themselves partly by that
time.
The remaining two helpless ones seemed very well and
chirped and hopped about a good deal. By degrees their feathers
improved, but it was not till the very end of September that one
of these managed to reach the perches. The other (October 9th)
is still on the floor, but tries hard to fly up. At present their
plumage does not change much. All the youngsters are dressed
in shades of brown, with light underparts, the two youngest being
rather sparrow-like in colour. Of the rest, one shows rather dark
*ear patches, another faint signs of them, and the upper part of
the breast is dark, but not one has a trace of the pretty mottled
breast of the adult bird, or the pinkish tint of the underparts.
There is a general likeness to the old bird in the head and beak,
and that is all that can be said at present.
The parents ate a good deal of soft food and a good many
mealworms while they were feeding their young, but though the
soft food is still put in it does not seem to be touched, and spray
millet is quite the favourite diet at present with the youugsters.
I am sorry not to give a fuller account, but being away from
home at the time makes it impossible, besides the eggs were

Mr. W. Teschemaker,
laid in a rush basket rather high up in the aviary so that one
could see nothing till the youngsters appeared.
November iStli.--Since writing the above the young Pec-
toral Finches have altered a little. They are now fine big birds,
and four show a good deal of the pretty mottling on the breast
like the adult bird. In the case of the youngsters, the black is
more apparent than the white, that is to say they all look like
hens, but owing probably to lack of heat the feathers grow very
slowly. The youngest must, I think, have something akin to
rickets, for he is still on the floor, and makes no progress at all.
THE BREEDING OF THE GREEN AVADAVAT.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
In June, 1904, I added to my aviaries a small one for
Avadavats and Waxbills, and on the 30th day of that month I
turned out four Green Avadavats. I have a note in my log book
that two of. them at once commenced to sing. As the song of
this species is so very seldom heard in captivity, it may be worth
while to remark that it consists of some preliminary notes, which
are practically inaudible, and concludes with a prolonged trill,,
which is often quite loud.
Although this species is, I think, quite hardy when once
acclimatised, it seems to arrive in this country in poor condition
generally; I soon lost two of my birds, and another pair,
subsequently introduced, only lived till October. The remaining
pair, however, did well and took possession of a nest box which
they defended with much spirit against all comers.
Towards the end of the year they laid and sat with remark-
able patience--but no result--for a whole month.
It was not until April, 1905, that they went to nest again,
and on the 22nd of that month I examined their nest and found
one egg which, although addled, had originally contained a
fertile embryo. This made me more hopeful of ultimately
breeding the species, especially as in the meantime I had
obtained seven younger birds in immature plumage.

I turned these out in a larger aviary, chiefly containing

foreign finches, on the 6tli March. This aviary is 9ft. high, 18ft.
wide, and 45ft. long, exclusive of the covered part, and is planted
with fruit trees, shrubs, and grass.
The change from immature to adult plumage is a very
interesting one. It is completed , in about a fortnight and is
apparently not accomplished by the moulting out of any feathers
but simply by a change in the colouring of the feathers. The
white bars are the first to make their appearance and, when they
appear irregularly (as for instance three on one side of the breast
and one on the other side), they impart a quaint and bizarre
effect to the individual. The dark stripes then appear and
lastly^ the bright buff and orange of the upper and under tail
coverts. I have a note to the effect that by May 18th the four
remaining young birds (three had died) were in full breeding
plumage.
Just at that time the pair of Avadavats in the smaller
aviary went into a heavy moult, casting their plumage freely, but
at the end of June they again went to nest in the same nest box.
And then--as the'piovelists say--a strange thing happened. I
left home on the 21st of June (at which time the Green Avadavats
were in sole possession of their nesting box and apparently
laying) and returned on the 3rd of July. On the afternoon of the
latter day a pair of Masked Grassfinckes were defending the
Avadavats' nest against the determined attacks of a pair of
Cordons, but the Avadavats themselves were not in evidence.
Looking into the nest I saw several young birds only just
hatched and evidently in bad case for some were on their backs.
Now I cannot positively say that these were young Green
Avadavats, but I have not the least doubt in my mind that the
latter laid the eggs, and the Grassfinclies took possession and
hatched them but were themselves displaced by the Cordons.
Next day the Cordons were in possession and the young
had totally disappeared.
Certainly one of the mysteries of aviary life is what
becomes of seven-tenths of the j^oung birds that are hatched--
they appear to vanish into thin air.
This adult pair of Avadavats made no further attempt to

nest this season, so we need say no more about them, but return
to the two pairs of young birds in the larger aviary.
One of these pairs wasted the season in fruitless struggles
with a pair of Gouldiaus for a particular nest box, but the other
pair built an untidy, loosely constructed spherical nest of hay
lined with feathers in the top of an apple tree, which no one
seemed to covet, so they were left in undisturbed possession and,
probably for this reason, their efforts met with success. I left
home again on September 14th, and, before my departure,
thought it well to remove a very large apple which hung
directly above the nest. While doing so, I could plainly hear the
young within and, apparently, about ready to fly, but I could not
look into the nest without great difficulty.
On my return, on October 6th, I found three young flying
and feeding themselves. To-day (October 15th) one has begun to
change colour and has two white and one dark stripes, which, I
think, is singular, because the seven immature birds which I
obtained must have been at least four months old before they
donned striped waistcoats.
Our excellent Editor and Hon. Correspondence Secretary
tell me that the Green Avadavat has not been previously bred
to their knowledge, but, personally, I should think so commonly
imported a species would probably have been bred ; no doubt our
members can settle the question.

"THE BIRDS AND THEIR STORY."*
At this season of the year those who have young friends
interested in Natural History are generally anxious to present
them with some reliable book which will give them enjoyment
while helping them with their nature studies, and it is with much
satisfaction that we are able to bring to their notice a book which
is not only extremely interesting to grown up and young folk
alike, but is also calculated to teach them much of the wonders
of bird life.

The name of R. B. Lodge is familiar to most people in
connection with his admirable photographic studies of animal
life, and, as might be expected in a book from his pen, the
illustrations are a very important and conspicuous feature, and,
with perhaps one or two exceptions, of the very highest ex-
cellence.
Some of the photographs have been coloured and repro-
duced by the three-colour process with considerable success,
though we must admit a preference for the uncoloured
pictures.
The first chapter is devoted to the Birds of Prey, which the
author has studied in many lands, and whose habits perhaps he
is as familiar with as any other naturalist. It is a deplorable fact
that many of these splendid and, in most cases, very useful birds
are becoming some of the rarest inhabitants of our land. Every
bird of prey, even the harmless and most useful Kestrels and
Owls, are ruthlessly sacrificed by ignorant gamekeepers, many of
whom unfortunately have masters who are still more ignorant in
matters of Natural History.
Other chapters are devoted to insect-eaters, seed and
vegetable eaters, wading birds, fresh-water birds, sea-birds and
flightless birds. Thus a wide field is scanned, though of course
British Birds come in for the lion's share of the author's
attention.
The Herons are an interesting group, and have been
studied and photograped by the author in their breeding haunts.
The Common Herons often nest amongst reeds in Holland, and
this doubtless is their original custom, though in this country
and elsewhere they have been obliged to adopt high trees as
nesting sites, for the preservation of their race. Abroad many
different species of Herons nest together in one large colony in
low bushes growing in the water, and these assemblages are very
striking.
One hardly likes to find any fault with so excellent a work
as the one now before us, but if only for the sake of having them
corrected in any future edition that may appear, we feel bound
to point out certain slight discrepancies. In the first place, in the
Introduction, the word "animals" is constantly used instead of

" mammals," the author frequently referring to " birds and
animals," as though the former were quite distinct from the
animal kingdom, instead of being quite as much animals as are
any four-footed beasts. But this fault is perhaps hardly worth
noticing ; a much more serious one is to be found on page 32,
where we are told that " The Hemipodes make a huge mound of
leaves and grasses, in which they bury their eggs and leave them
there to hatch." Doubtless this is merely a slip of the pen, the
author having intended to write " Megapodes," but it is never-
theless an error which is very misleading. Again the author
refers to the male Ostrich's numerous wives, but we believe that
the truly wild Ostrich is strictly monogamous although often
stated to be polygamous. When domesticated it may occasionally
become polygamous like some other domestic animals.
Mr. Dodge's book is thoroughly well got up and does great
credit to both author and publisher.

Most of our members have for many years been familiar with that
excellent popular weekly journal The Feathered World, and have watched
its growth from a very small to a very large paper, dealing with all kinds of
poultry, pigeons, and cage-birds.
Those interested only in small birds were perhaps sometimes bored
by the amount of matter relating to domestic poultry and the numerous
pictures of, to them, unnatural and unlovely pigeons with over-grown
crops, or beaks too small to feed their own young.
So much has this paper grown that it was found impossible to deal
with all the matter received, and it has been found necessary to divide it
into two separate papers, the one dealing with poultry and pigeons under
the original title, and the other with cage-birds under the name of Canary
and Cage-bird Lije to be published every Friday at the price of one penny.
We are favoured with the first few numbers of this latter paper which
contains much that is useful to cage-bird keepers, and we can only say that
we wish it the success that its parent, The Feathered World has attained
nnder the able management of Mrs. Comyns-Lewer.

Sir, --I have pleasure in sending you herewith C. E. Dyson's Book on
Bird-keeping, as received from the Author soon after publication. You will
see that the Preface is dated July 1S7S. That Preface, which I had not read
until now, mentions a previously published edition of the little work.
This book will enable you, or our Publisher, or anyone else interested
in the matter, to compare the prices of birds quoted in 1S78 with the prices
quoted in the previous edition. I do not think any very great difference
will be found, for I commenced collecting foreign birds about 1S69, and for
a good many years visited, once a week or so, the shops of the late Mr.
Clias. Jamrach, the late Mr. Abrahams, and a Mr. Rice who then had a shop
in the Commercial Road and who was killed mail} 7 years ago by a tiger he
tried to tame.
Between 1S68 and 1878 there was little change in the average price of
birds, except perhaps in the case of Leiothrix luteus, for I remember paying
#10 for a pair of the earliest importation, and I see C. E. Dyson's book
quotes the price in 1878 at #1 10/- to #2 10/-. The other prices are approxi-
mately those the above-named dealers charged in 1S69 and in the subse-
quent ten years.
As regards the price of Gould's book on Birds of Australia, stated to
be found catalogued in 1880 at ^175, whilst I wrote in the Avicultural
Magazine of November 1900 that twentjr years previously, i. e. in 1S80, it
was not to be had for less than 60 or So guineas, the apparent contradiction
is easily explained.
This magnificent work was published by the Author, and a great
number of copies were disposed of by subscription, went into public
libraries, or into the hands of very rich collectors. Between 1870 and 1880
I had verj r much desired to possess a copy, but found that dealers asked
about double the subscription price, or about ^175. I had commissioned
an antiquarian to let me know if the work ever appeared in the catalogue
of an auction or could be otherwise had at a moderate second-hand price.
After years of fruitless waiting for such an opportunity, the person com-

was reported to me to the effect that he had only two copies, one of which
he intended to keep under any circumstances, the other he would part with.

at that price my agent asked me to authorise him to bid #&lt;oo --or sixtj T

was published about 1879 without a date. In consequence of a recent little
controversy respecting the re-appearance of this old book on the market
I have taken the habit of looking at the date of every book which comes
into my hands. I am astonished how many books are published without a
date! This method may facilitate the ultimate disposal of publisher's
stocks, but seems to me unjust to the writers and buyers of books. I think
buyers of books ought to know and have a right to know in what year a
book which they purchase has been written and published. At an auction
which I attended by the merest accident I saw a book on Domestic Medicine
offered, and as I did not possess such a book I bid a few shillings and
bought it. When I looked at my purchase at leisure, I found that I had
bought a book which had no date, and which has probably been published
so many years ago that some of the remedies advised in cases of accident
or sudden illness would be now unobtainable or their use ridiculed by a
doctor of the present day. The absence of a date on that book had en-
abled somebody to sell for 3/6 or 5/- a book which, by the lapse of time, had
only the value of waste paper. AUG. F. Wirnjjr.

Sir,--H aving bred Masked Grassfinclies (Poephila perso?iata) this
season with limited success, and believing it to be the first time that these
birds have been bred in this country, I send you the following account of
my experiences.
In April last I wrote to one of the London dealers for one cock and
two hen Long-tailed Grassfinclies (Poephila acuticauda). O11 the arrival of
the birds my first thought on looking into the travelling cage was " How
yellow their beaks are ! " but on turning them into a large cage I saw at
once that they were birds which I had never seen before, and which I sub-
sequently found were Masked Grassfinclies. Liking their appearance, I
decided to keep them.
Towards the end of June, I turned them into one of my outdoor
aviaries (6ft. wide and 35ft. long), in which their companions were Gouldian
Finches (Black and Red), Long-tailed Grassfinclies, Pectoral Finches,
Diamond Sparrows, Zebra Finches, and Double-banded Finches. This
aviary has three parts--an inner of brick with slated roof, a middle of glass,
and an outer of wire netting. Just over the door of the glass partition was
a German Canary cage fixed to a beam which formed a narrow shelf behind
it. The Masked Finches very soon commenced to fill this cage with little
tufts of flowering grass, with which I supply my finches every day during
the summer. After filling it and the shelf behind with a shapeless mass of
this material they formed a small cavity with a long entrance-hole, so that
it was impossible to see into the cavity. The entrance-hole seemed to be
horizontal, and the nest-cavity must have been 011 the shelf beyond the

cage. Grass only was used in the construction of the nest although other
materials were supplied.
After this only two Masked Finches were to be generally seen about
the aviary, and one day, as the third had not been visible for a long time, I
risked looking into the entrance-hole, when the bird flew out, but it was
impossible to see into the nest. I did not, however, hear any young, and
was beginning to think that the eggs (if eggs there were) must have been
unfertile, when one morning in the middle of September I found on the
floor two little dead birds, which were undoubtedly young Masked Finches.
One was much larger than the other, both were well-fledged and the
larger must have been ready to leave the nest. They were warm and there-
fore recently dead, and the larger had a deep gash down one leg baring it to
the bone. On examining the nest I did not find any more young birds or
any eggs, but there were sure signs of its recent occupation by a young
family. I sent the birds to Dr. Creswell for examination, and his report
appears in the October number of "Bird Notes."
The food supplied in this aviary consisted of canary seed, white and
spray millet, cuttle-fish bone, and flowering grass. No soft food of any
kind was given.
I may mention that about a fortnight before the finding of the young
Masked Finches, I lost a young Gouldiau Finch (the only bird in the nest)
in a similar way, and it had received an exactly similar injury to that in-
flicted on the larger of the two Masked Finches. Whether this was done
before or after being thrown out of the nest I do not know.
Oct. 15th, 1905. T. N. Wilson.
[The Masked Grassfinch was first bred in this country by Mr. L. W.
Hawkins in 1890, while Mr. D. Seth-Smith reared five young birds from one
pair (2 nests) in 1902. We have not heard of other instances but the species-
has been commonly imported and has probably bred several times.-- Ed.].

Sir, --Could you give me some information about Parrot Finches?
Which is the best time of the year to purchase them, and what would be
the price I should have to pay ? Can you tell me the names of dealers
from whom I should be likely to obtain them ? How can I distinguish the
sexes ? Are they hardy birds that could be kept in a small garden aviary
with a chance of breeding ? What is the best food for them, and do you
think they would agree with Diamond Finches? If yon can give me any
further hints I shall be greatly obliged. Frank BaThk.
The following reply was sent to Mi. Frank Bathe:
If Parrot Finches could be obtained at all times of the year I should
advise purchasing them in the Spring, but it is so very seldom that any
are to be obtained that you would do well to seize the first opportunity of

securing any r that are offered for sale. I have not known of any being
offered by dealers for some years past. The few that are now in Europe
are in the possession of a handful of fortunate avicultulists. As to the
price, I think you would be fortunate if y r ou secured a good acclimatized
pair for anything under #5 at the present time. A newly imported pair
would be worth from #5 to #4.
As to how to distinguish the &apos;sexes, it is very difficult to give any rule
which will help you. I can nearly always distinguish them myself if there
are several together, but with a given bird it is most difficult. When in
perfect condition however the cocks are brighter coloured, the red on the
throat and forehead is rather more extensive and the legs and feet are
slightly darker in colour than in the hens; moreover the cocks have an
altogether bolder appearance than their wives.
Parrot Finches when acclimatized are moderately hardy, but must
have some warmth in the winter. You could not keep them all the year
round in an unlieated outdoor aviary&quot;, at least it would be, in my opinion,
extremely unwise to try the experiment. When newly imported they need
considerable care.
For the last three summers I have bred Parrot Finches in an aviary
which consists of a good-sized brick-built house and a large wire flight in
which shrubs etc. are planted. Curiously enough they have always
selected an old straw sailor hat for a nesting-site. I have nailed several
of these against the brick wall of their house, rather high up. They are
fastened with the brim flat against the wall, the longest axis being vertical,
and an entrance-hole cut out near the top. This the birds quickly fill up
with hay and moss. They are excellent sitters, and in every way more
certain breeders than the majority of the Grassfinclies.
The young birds have the sides of the mouth ornamented with four
brilliant blue beads which appear to be semi-luminous, at any rate they&apos; are
visible in the darkness of the nest when all else seems blackness, and there
seems little doubt that they enable the parents to see where to place the
food, for when the old bird stands in the small entrance-hole the young
birds are practically in darkness. When they leave the nest the young
birds are a dull green with tail dull reddish, and a certain amount of red
on the face. The extent of this latter however varies very considerably,
some having practically none while in others the face is nearly as red as in
a poor adult specimen. The young birds have the lower mandible of ihe
bill bright yellow, while the whole bill is black in the adults.
Canary and millet seed forms the staple diet, but they should have
flowering grass whenever it can be obtained. Cliickweed is also excellent,
and they are very fond of green wheat in the ear.
In 1903 seven young birds were reared in my aviary from one pair
(3 nests); in 1904 the same pair reared five (2 nests); and this last summer
a brood of three was successfully reared, but I am not sure if the parents
are the same birds as before.

AVIARIES FOR PARRAKEETS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998284769230769" page_id="32720472"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I wonder whether you could give advice, in the journal, on a
matter that would, I feel sure, be of use to budding aviculturists like
myself. I am building five aviaries for Parrakeets, having inner rooms from
loft, by 10ft. to 7ft. by 10ft., with outside flights ranging from 15ft. by 10ft.
to 20ft. by 10ft. Now how to stock them is the question.
I read that Conures are dangerous with other birds, also that Blue
Mountains are spiteful with other Parrakeets, and so on.
It seems ridiculous to give up a whole aviary to a pair of Jendayas or
a pair of Blue Mountains. Would Jendayas do with other Conures, and
Blue Mountains with other Lorikeets of about the same size and vice versa f
What I should like to see, if it could be drawn up, would be a list of
birds that would do together in pairs in the same aviary ; also of those
birds that would agree, three or four pairs together, if they would not
agree with others of a different kind. Of course, in asking for a list of
mixed Parrakeets, &amp;c., I do not expect them to breed when mixed; if I
find they do well with me I shall erect a flight of almshouses for the
widowed, unattached and mated pairs.
Hoping I am not asking too much. E. J. Brook.
[Your aviaries would be very suitable for breeding Parrakeets, one
pair in each compartment, but if you wish to keep them for show and not for
breeding you can keep several, say half-a-dozen birds in each compartment.
But there will be occasional battles, which may result in the death of the
weaker of the combatants. Parrakeets vary greatly in disposition, some
being perfectly good tempered, while others of the same species cannot be
trusted with anything weaker than themselves. Again, others which are
generally peaceably disposed will suddenly turn spiteful. I once had a very
fine pair of Brown's Parrakeets, which appeared to be on the best of terms
with one another until the cock fell in love with a hen Many-coloured
Parrakeet in the next aviary and forthwith turned on his own wife and
would have murdered her had I not rescued her just in time. I have found
Blue-bonnets particularly untrustworthy with other Parrakeets or, in fact,
other birds of any kind ; and Redrumps and most of the Conures are about
as bad.
From the above you will see that no hard and fast rule can be laid
down as to what species can be kept together with safety&apos;. The dangerous
time is when the birds begin to think about nesting; then perhaps two
cocks will make love to the same hen, with the result that each does his
best to get rid of the other. Most of the larger Parrakeets will live
peaceably with Budgerigars, which they simply ignore. For my part I have

always made a point of keeping one pair only in each aviary, and I am con-
vinced that this is the most satisfactory way of keeping Parrakeets, but
many of our members have kept mixed collections of these birds, and I
hope they will give their experience in these columns.--D. Seth-SmiTh].

Sir, --When in the July number of the Avicultural Magazine, in
response to the request of a correspondent, I gave the result of my
experience as to the liability of birds contracting certain forms of infectious
*disease, I particularly mentioned that I did not claim to be an authority on
the subject. And neither before nor since that date have I communicated
either directly or indirectly with Cage Birds on the subject.
If there happens to be any doubt as to the possibility of either large
or small birds contracting such a disease as consumption, then, the matter
can only be settled by a commission of bacteriological experts and not by
that single, self-constituted expert of Bird Notes, the hysterical and
offensive ebullitions from whose pen are not deserving of any further notice
at my hands. James George Myran.

Sir, --In the Dichotomous Key to the Birds of Australia, which has
just reached this country in the form of a supplement to the October
number of the Emu, I find some curious statements. Allow me to refer to
one, which is a trifle startling.
At page 35 we have the entry of the Gouldian Finch, Poephila gouldice,
" Forehead and face black." Then comes a note, "This is the youthful
stage of the following species." The "following species " is the " Scarlet-
headed Finch," Poephila mirabilis, the bird which used to be called
the Beautiful Grassfincli, but is now commonly known by the careless
name of Red-headed Gouldian; this species, by the way, I was the first to
breed in this country.
The Key tells us, if there is any meaning in words, that the Black-
headed Gouldian is the young of the Red-headed Gouldian, that P. gouldicz
is simply an immature P. mirabilis.
What is the " youthful stage" of a Gouldian Finch, Red or Black?
The young of both are greenish birds, neither red nor black in
.colour.
Then they moult respectively (if good birds and properly treated)
into either Red-headed or Black-headed Gouldians.
In past years I have had numbers of both species ; and with me they
\0x25A0(especially the males) have lived for long periods; but each bird, Red or
Black, male or female, has invariably moulted true to colour--a Black has
never moulted into a Red.

I still liave one old male Black-lieaded Gouldian Finch (Gould's
Grassfinch), P. gouldice, the date of whose arrival here is lost in the mist
of ages, but every year he still moults true, decided, well defined black.
May I ask when he may be expected to pass out of the " youthful stage " and
obtain the red forehead and face of P. mirabilis ?

Sir, --In reply to Dr. CreswelPs note, I am much obliged to him for
his appreciation, but would like to point out (i) that Prof. Newton (whose
accuracy is proverbial) gives the various dates etc. quite correctly, so that
the blame for these does not rest with " his authorities " but either with
Dr. Creswell or the "unfortunate printer"!
(2) I certainly fail to see how my notes confirm what Dr. Creswell
wrote, as they entirel}&apos; disprove his statement that none of the old authors
whom he quoted (Turner, Gesuer, Aldrovandus and Willughby) made any
mention of green in the colouration, and also show that the Canary cannot
have been a commo?i cage-bird for some considerable period later than he
states. " Oneooker."
A FINE EXAMPLE OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ART.
Sir,-- 111 the November number of the "Sunday Strand" in an
article entitled "The Romance of the Monuments" is a most characteristic
picture of three species of Geese by an artist whose works were as old in
the days of Abram as the frescoes of Pompeii are in ours. At each end of
the picture is a goose feeding, a bird closely resembling our Brent Goose
but showing no white on the neck ; next to this on the left we have a pair
of White-fronted Geese, and on the right a pair of Red-breasted Geese.
The drawing of these birds is far superior to that of later Egyptian artists.
This picture is preserved in the Cairo Museum. A. G. Bui&apos;EER.

Sir,--F or a long time I have entertained the idea that the effective-
ness of the coloured plates in the Avicultural Magazine is seriously
marred by the darkness of the backgrounds.
Anyone who has looked through the British Museum Catalogue of
Birds will have noticed the same defect, which to a large extent obscures the
distinctness of outline of the birds represented. This is not caused merely
by the colouring but by the design itself. Take the current issue (October)
of our magazine for example, where the Red-capped Parrot is drawn, and
it will be easily seen how the blemish, as I consider it, is apparent.
I may be old-fashioned, but I much prefer coloured illustrations of
birds without a back-ground at all. I recall to mind " Morris's British
Birds," with its clearly defined figures of the birds.
The object of our illustrations, I take it is to give us an idea of

the contour of the birds in their natural colours, and. not so much to make
a picture. It does seem a pity that we should not have the full benefit of
the charming drawings, owing to the defect I mention.

DIAMOND DOVES.
These extremely graceful and beautiful little doves are much better
suited for large natural aviaries with plenty of growing trees than for small
aviaries or cages. They are timid birds and liable to hurt themselves if
suddenly startled in a small space. In large aviaries, however, they are
perfectly delightful. Two pairs were liberated into my largest aviary last
April, and quickly commenced to build their fragile nests in any branch
that offered a platform for a nest no more than two inches in diameter.
The first pair of squabs came to grief during a spell of bitter weather,
but after this all went well, and nest after nest appeared and the Diamond
Doves multiplied.
I have recently caught them up for the winter and find their number
has increased from four to seventeen.

NOTES ON MRS. JOHNSTONE'S LORIKEET.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995635" page_id="32720482"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
So far as it is at present known, this pretty Lorikeet is
found only on the mountains of Mindanao, in the Southern
Philippines, ranging between the altitude of 4,000 and 8,000 feet.
It was discovered by me in the early part of 1903 on the Apo
Volcano, the highest peak of the Philippine Archipelago, whose
altitude is said to be a little over 10,100 feet. The species was
named by Dr. Hartert of the Tring Museum in honour of Mrs.
Johnstone.
The picturesque and active Volcano of Apo stands about
20 miles inland from the S. E. Coast of the Davao province, and
appears to fall away in a succession of gradual forest-covered
slopes to the sea ; but, on nearer acquaintance, these slopes are
not nearly so gentle as they appear to be from a distance, for the
luxuriant forests hide many a deep gorge where raging torrents
rush down from the heights above and whose cold waters must
be traversed for considerable distances and crossed again and
again with no little danger to travellers. Cliffs must be scaled
at dizzy heights where scarce a foothold exists beyond that
afforded by a few clinging roots. Turning some ugly corners
in this manner is extremely risky work and at first sight seems
an impossibility. There is another and longer trail up the
mountains to the highest Bagobo village of Tandaya, by which
the worst part of the waters is avoided ; but it is in some ways
more tiring and is only used by the natives during the rainy
season when the former is impassable.
The whole mountain is covered with dense jungle up to

about 8,500 ft., beyond which comes a broken, white stoney slope
and crumbling cliffs intersected by many burning fissures from
which proceed an incessant noise as of colossal machinery at
work underground. The white slope viewed from a distance
conveys the impression of a snow-capped summit and it is
difficult to believe that it is not so. At sunrise and sunset it
glows with all the beautiful tints of a snowy peak.
The upper forests are dark and gloomy, and the thick,
hanging--and often black looking--mosses which cover every
trunk and branch, give a funereal appearance to the whole. One
seems to come upon this depressing region with a strange sudden-
ness, for a little below are many deep arms in the mountain
containing hot springs from which steam, always arising, causes
a rank growth of the most verdant tropical vegetation
imaginable to spring up. Giant ferns and beautiful oichids here
struggle with each other for supremacy.
On a bright early morning I first came across T. johnsto 7 ii&lt;z.
Ascending from my camp to the upper forest limits, I stood for a
while looking up the white slopes to the crater above, when I
was surprised to hear the unmistakeable sound of Lorikeets
chattering near by. I had no sooner located the noise in an
isolated tree which stood a lonely giant amidst all the stunted
vegetation around, than a flock of thirty or more flew out, and
after circling round at a great height again entered the thick tree
top. Beyond noticing the yellow undersides of their wings
flash as they turned in the sunlight, it was impossible to gather
any idea of their appearance. I was convinced that this must be
a new species, but there seemed little chance of securing any
specimen there, as the tree was quite inaccessible from where I
stood with no means of getting round to it. The next day I was
again on my way to the same place, but long before I reached the
forest limit my Bagobo guide stopped and pointed to some birds
he had seen in the thick bushes overhead. Personally I could
see nothing; neither was there a sound to be heard, but at length
I noticed the leaves moving, although it was impossible to distin-
guish any bird so gloomy was it all round. I fired and nothing
fell, but the air was suddenly alive with the screaming of Lories
beyond the tree tops. Even then I could get no sight of them.

Notes on Mrs. Johnstone&apos;s Lorikeet. 85
My boy assured me I had killed one, and at length I could see it
hanging by its feet and only after much trouble did we succeed in
dislodging it, and then for the first time I held T. johnstonice in
my hand.
After this I came across them several times. On one
occasion I was startled by a flock suddenly flying with much
noise out of a sunny little place where they had been busy
feeding on the low flowering trees around, and did not betray
their presence until I was close up to them. When feeding,
they maintain complete silence like most of the Parrot family,
Lories in particular; although at other times so very noisy.
Much clear honey runs from their beaks after they are shot,
which makes a great mess of their feathers, unless care is taken
to stop up the beak and nostrils at once with cotton-wool, even
then it is not always effectual unless renewed, for it quickly gets
saturated. This applies to all Lories.
During my first visit to Mindanao, in 1903, I had but little
opportunity to become acquainted with these birds, as my stay
on the volcano was cut short on account of the rainy season
setting in with great violence earlier than usual. In the begin-
ning of the present year I saw much more of them and succeeded
in obtaining not only a series of skins, but some live specimens
also; four of which reached England alive, one of these
succumbing, though, a few days after its arrival.
The native Bagobo name for them is " lisli-lish," after
their call-note. This custom of naming birds by their call is
generally adopted by wild tribes all the world over, and almost
\0x25A0entirely so by the the Bagobos. Every evening from my camp
on Apo I used to hear them passing overhead in small flocks to
their sleeping-places lower down the mountain, returning again
to the higher forests with the break of day ; but at these times it
was seldom possible to catch even a passing glimpse of them on
account of the camp being much shut in by trees. When flying
they utter incessantly their pretty lish lish.
After leaving Davao on my first visit in 1903 we took on
board at Malabang a number of Moro prisoners of note. One of
them was accompanied by a little boy who had one of these
Lorikeets as a pet. It was fastened by the leg to a stick and was

Mr. Walter Goodfellow,
perfectly tame. I tried in vain to buy it, but nothing would
tempt the youngster to part with it, and he even cried in antici-
pation that I should take it by force. The American soldiers in
charge of the prisoners advised me to take it if I wanted it; but
after seeing how much he treasured it I had no wish to deprive
him of it. The bird had evidently come with the Moros from
the Lake Lando region which is situated at a considerable alti-
tude above the sea. I have since heard that they are plentiful
on the mountains around the lake.
During my recent visit to Apo numbers of trees bearing
masses of beautiful scarlet flowers were in full bloom about the
highest village of Tandaya which were frequented all day by the
Lish-lish. The natives said they come down when these trees
are in bloom. This is probably their lowest range--4,000 feet--
for at the next village of Sibutan, a little lower down, the
Bagobos told me they, were not found around there. After
infinite trouble I succeeded in getting the natives of Tandaya to
catch me some, but it was a still greater trouble to- get them
down to the coast and on to Davao, and they must have found
the days of rough travelling and the heat of the coast very
trying. However, I got them safely through and they remained
in Davao for several months, but although the}&apos; had a roomy
cage, and were kept as cool as possible, they undoubtedly
suffered at first more from the heat than anything else and three
of them soon died. It was remarkable how with one exception
they quickly got tame ; several climbing on to my hand together
while I was feeding them. Coming down from the mountains I
fed them on wild honey ^diluted with water, but as soon as I
reached the coast I substituted Swiss milk for it : they took to
this readily as I have found all Lories will, in fact their supply
required to be regulated or they filled their crops so full that it
ran from their beaks. This was the only food I could get them
to take for a long time, until one after another they began to
nibble a little banana which they finally got to like very much.
On the voyage home they also readily ate grapes and oranges.
They were very fond of bathing and every day plunged fearlessly
into the water one after the other until they were completely
drenched.

Notes on Mrs. Johnstone s Lorikeet. 87
There appears to be little or no outward difference that I
could discover between the sexes, but about April last they
paired off and their happy home was broken up for a time.
Fighting, screaming, and confusion was the order of the day
until each pair kept a perch or corner of the cage to themselves.
One odd male had to be removed altogether or undoubtedly
there would have been murder. At this time they added a sweet
warbling love song to their usual calls, and their love dance was
really amusing if somewhat absurd. At these times the males
swayed backwards and forwards 011 the perches with all feathers
ruffled, and uttered a blowing noise. One pair (the pair Mrs.
Johnstone now has) eventually ruled the cage, and this caused
the weaker pairs to forget minor differences and chum somewhat
together, but their compact was not lasting and they sometimes
forgot themselves until their natural enemies stepped in and the
down-trodden ones were friends again in face of the common foe.
Several eggs (four I think in all) were dropped in the cage and
broken, so I have no doubt that Mrs. Johnstone will be able to
breed her namesakes next year if she gets them through the
present winter, which I think she is sure to do in her beautiful
new aviaries at Burrswood. Given sufficient space I have no
doubt that several pairs would nest together in harmony, and
perhaps like Budgerigars do so more readily. They ought to
thrive well in England so far as climate is concerned. During
February and March I kept a record of the temperature at my
camp on Apo, and at six o'clock in the morning I often found it
as low as 34* Fall., while the highest mid-day temperature in the
shade was 62*. This was an isolated reading, for it more often
reached only 56* and 58* Fall. This was the dry season during
the N. E. monsoon, but in July and August the temperature
would doubtless be somewhat higher.
At night I found the Eish-lish all slept together crowded
into one corner at the bottom of the cage, with their heads to the
wall. I often heard little squabbles going 011 in the night as one
probably tried to get a warmer spot and pushed others out. No
doubt in their wild state they sleep in this manner in the holes of
trees for the sake of mutual warmth during the cold nights in
the high altitudes which they inhabit.

Mr. R. Phillipps,
[We are very grateful to Mr. Goodfellow for this extremely interest-
ing and valuable article.
The coloured figure which appears this month is the first illustration
ever drawn of this rare species which was described at a meeting of the
British Ornithologists' Club on October 21st, 1903, by Dr. E. Hartert, who
made the following observations, as published in the Club's Bulletin :
"This curious new Parrot resembles in its breast-markings the Cele-
besian Psitteuteles meyeri very closely, but the coloration of the head is
more like that of Ptilosclera versicolor. It would connect the genera
Psitteuteles and Ptilosclera , which are said to differ by their coloration only.
I cannot see that they can be separated, nor can I see the possibility of
separating Trichoglossus and Psitteuteles generically. I11 fact the "type" of
the genus Psitteuteles is as typical a Trichoglosus as I can imagine, though
T. meyeri , T. flavovirid.es, and T. chlorolepidotus differ more by the color-
ation of the underside.
"This handsome Lor} 7 is named after Mrs. Johnstone, who is well
known as an aviculturist and especially successful in breeding Parrots in
captivity."]
THE REGENT BIRD.
Sericulus melhvus.
By Reginald Phillipps.
(Continued from page 68 J.
On August 6, in the early morning, all was quiet, about 9
all was excitement. I found the mother on the perch across the
front of the hamper with her head down inside attending to
somebody, while the other two Regents, close behind her, were
looking over her shoulders and craning their necks in frantic
endeavours to get a peep at " Baby." If was a funny sight, but
an anxious time for me. I had been unable to obtain any cock-
roaches, and, to my consternation, the mother would not look at
a mealworm. However, about 9.30, I persuaded her (for she
knows and rarely fails to respond to my call) to carry wasp-
grubs. Wasp-grubs, as received in London from advertisers in
the country, are unsatisfactor}^; they are more or less baked,
more or less sodden, more or less rotten, but fora while they kept
things going. From time to time, at most irregular intervals, I
obtained a few cockroaches, and these were seized with avidity,
the mother leaving the nest and following and calling to me for

these treasures--they might have been blue diamonds such a
price I had to pay for them, such a difficulty I experienced in
obtaining them ; and this in London, full of cockroaches, and of
people begging for money, but too selfish and spoilt to stretch
out a finger to help one. I could enter into the feelings of the
Ancient Mariner, and cry out in my despair, " Beetles, beetles
everywhere but ne'er a one for me." From time to time the
mother would carry mealworms, but only under protest; gentles
I think she never touched ; then for a while she tried cut up
sultana raisins ; egg-flake had a very brief and inglorious innings ;
and at last she came to sop ; and for weeks the two young
Regents were fed more on biscuit-sop than anything else. Fruit
she would not look at; but I have seen her pull up sprouting
wheat about two inches long and stuff it down the youngsters'
throats. During this time she did what I never before saw a
Regent do--dart into the air after any winged creature that
might chance to enter the aviary. She was ever on the alert,
worked like a nigger though sitting very tight in cold weather,
and never tired in her love and devotion to her young. A better
mother I never came across. For my part, I visited the aviary
early every morning, cleared off cats, attended to the food, and
saw that everything was in order ; the cats nearly caused disaster
on two occasions notwithstanding all my care.
It was characteristic of the species that all the time of
nesting and rearing the young everything should have been
conducted so quietly ; there were no screams, no loud cries--all
were subdued and suppressed. Only on two occasions did I hear
the young in the nest--suitable food had run out and the little
ones were peckish I suppose. The first occasion was on the
18th, and I could distinguish two different tones, the first inti-
mation I received of there being two of them. The cry at this
stage was something between that of a young English Jay and a
brood of common Starlings in the hollow of a tree.
About 4.30 in the afternoon of August 22, I noticed a
strange bird perched at the far end of a long pole which stretches
away from the nest for some yards :--it was a baby Regent. It
was of a very light gray colour, partly but not entirely owing to
the white down, and at a distance looked much like a young

Mr. R. Philupps,
Mistle Thrush. The mother was dancing about in front of the
nest endeavouring to persuade the second youngster to come out,
and unfortunately in this she was successful. It was not so well
clothed nor so forward as the elder youngster, made a false step
while tripping along the pole, which was too thick to be grasped,
and had a heavy fall. At night there followed a thunder-storm,
so from the time it left the nest, prematurely for this climate, the
fates were against it. As days went by, whereas the first could
fly well, the second made unsatisfactory progress, the cold and
wet were too much for it, and its breathing became heavy and
laboured. I never lost an opportunity of putting it under shelter
or in some snug corner, but the wild instincts of the mother,
which had been remarkably developed conterminously with the
nesting, were ever against me. Splendid mother though she
was, in this one matter she failed, and was mainly answerable
for the death of her youngest child. Her leading idea was to
entice the youngsters away from me and from all artificial
structures, and to hide them amongst the thickest natural foliage
the aviary afforded.
On August 30 matters reached a climax; both of the
youngsters were affected ; and I saw that if they were to be
saved they must be brought into the house. The mother was
altogether too wild and excited to be shut up within four walls,
so there was nothing to be done but to throw open the birdroom
window and herd the birds together promiscuously, a few of the
most aggressive being caged.
During the day the young Regents, who had been taught
to come on to my finger, would allow themselves to be carried
into the birdroom without giving much trouble ; sometimes they
would remain there ; but towards bedtime mother would come
after them and would utter her curious spluttering call, and the
young birds, as lively and slippery as eels, would be up and
away: they could be kept in the birdroom only by shutting them
in ; and I was shy of extreme measures for fear the mother
might desert them, but there was no help for it.
The young ones now improved, and on September 2 I
noticed the elder in the wild-bird adult posture. Both, however,
varied, at times flying as cleverly as adults at others depressed,

on the Regent Bird.
they were up and down in a manner I failed to account for, and
occasionally the younger displayed very serious symptoms. On
September 7 it suddenly collapsed and signs of poison seemed to
be unmistakable, and I could think of nothing but of some sleepy
cockroaches. The malady yielded to treatment, and by the 9th
the bird was getting on well. But on that day I had to go out,
heavy and continuous rain came on, and when I brought it in--
for the mother had taken it into the garden--the violent diarrhoea
and laboured breathing had returned, and it passed away during
the night of September 10--11.
About this time I noticed that the survivor was refusing
food ; the mother would hover about it with her daintiest morsels
and endeavour to induce it to open its mouth, but without avail.
During the 13th it was most seriously ill, and the effects of what
little medicine I could give were neutralised by its insistence in
remaining in the garden in the cold and wet. On the 14th it
was worse but I could not keep it in the birdroom ; by midday
however it had so far collapsed as to be unable to fly. This time
I resolved there should be no half measures, so I took it away
entirely and placed it in a cage in my dining-room. That there
was poison somewhere was unquestionable, and I knew it was
not cockroaches this time. Suddenly the truth flashed across
my mind. In the garden there were a common and two golden
elder trees, and the foliage of the latter being very thick the
young Regents had passed much of their time amongst their
branches. It was their custom to nibble at every leaf within
their reach; elder leaves I learn set up a purgative action ; this
had started and kept up the mischief which the cold and wet had
aggravated. The old Regents, I suspect, had learnt from ex-
perience that these leaves should be avoided ; but I lost several
little finches which drank from some water-dishes into which the
leaves were continuously falling.
Laudanum, brandy and lime water, bovril, and the shelter
and comfort of its new quarters, saved the young Regent, and in
two or three days it had fairly recovered. I had to hand-feed it
a little, but it soon took to its food, and on and from the 17th it
wholly dispensed with my help and was getting on well. On the
21st I found it aping the adult and " yar-ring " and going through

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
contortions before a female Silver-eared Mesia that was confined
in the same cage. Was this an indication of sex ?
During the afternoon of the 21st I returned it to the bird-
room, where it encountered the odd female, and they regarded
one another with mutual suspicion. It flew into the garden
followed by the inquisitive spinster, and soon found mother; at
first there was a little shyness between them, but soon mother
was hopping round and about it, and she took it once more
under her charge. Baby opened its mouth for food, but mother
did not respond ; then Baby went after mother, but with no better
result. Then the young hopeful lost its temper and attacked
both its mother and the second female. As to the old father--
he went off in the sulks and hid himself, a trifle jealous, and
possibly thinking of a future rival in the harem.
Baby and mother were always together. Mother led it
about and showed it all the ins and outs of the aviaries and
birdroom, and the various nooks and corners where the several
food dishes were to be found. But Baby lacked something--it
could not get any cockroaches; when these were put out, some
other bird stepped down before Baby and carried them off. And
now once more that grand old mother detected what was wrong
and came to the rescue. On the 26th I noticed how spruce the
youngster was looking. In the afternoon I put out some cock-
roaches, and down came the mother with all her old fire and
scattered the other birds to the winds. Cramming her mouth
full, she went back to Baby in her funny way and recommenced
feeding. After this, Baby followed its mother to the tin, and
mother would keep off the other birds until every cockroach had
been disposed of, for many days not touching one herself. She
finally ceased to feed the young bird about October 25.
For a long time the male and second female were always
together ; but they began to get tired of making love in the cold
and wet; and their love-parlour, spoilt by the rain, was deserted ;
and so it came to pass that on September 25 all of the Regents
were once more united in a family party and were t playing to-
gether, to Baby's great delight.
After this I had no trouble with Baby beyond seeing it did
not stay out too much in the cold and wet. Every evening the

Regents were driven into the birdroom, the comforts of which
Baby soon learned to appreciate. But the youngster could be
very wilful, and would sometimes dart back over my head to the
farthest corner of the aviary with a wild and cheeky Ske -- or-r-r-r-r r
which presumably meant " Catch me if you can."
When about to feed the young, unless they were very
hungry, the mother did not fly to them direct. She would
approach by some roundabout way, and then would hop in their
vicinity, above below and around them, in a very comical manner,
and I soon learned what this hop meant. The young, who did
not cuddle together and were often separated, rarely betrayed
their whereabouts by the slightest sound ; in absolute silence
they would open their mouths and swallow the food.
The " Feeding from the Crop" question was ever present
to my mind. I have read somewhere, I think in the Auk , that
all birds feed their young from the crop for the first few days.
Unquestionably some insectivorous birds do, at any rate under
certain circumstances, but there is a difference between "all"
and "some." On three&apos;occasions after the young Regents had
left the nest the mother may have been feeding from the crop,
but I was not witness to a single instance in which I can say that
she was so feeding. From the first, whilst the young were in the
nest, the food, even sop, could be seen in the mother's bill.
However, I was much impressed by another circumstance.
Whenever % I attempted to administer physic or food to either of
the young, with mandibles slightly parted, accompanied by a
sucking action, they persisted in pushing the head forward to the
full stretch of the neck with a perfectly instinctive and mechanical
movement, as if it were their custom to thrust their bills well
into the mother's mouth and beyond for the purpose of imbibing
soft food. Whenever I did see the mother feed, the youngster
held its head down with open mouth pointing well upwards,
while the mother, drawing herself up to her full height, w r ould
reach over and above it, and most gently and carefully deposit
the food well down the throat. She often carried enough at a
time for three or four of such feeds. For myself, I found they
could comfortably swallow only what was moist; even a small
cockroach had to be dipped in some fluid.

Mr. R. Philupps,
During the nesting, several calls were uttered which were
new to me, mostly in very low and suppressed tones; evidently
the breeding Regent in the wild state does not unnecessarily give
herself away. The Fieldfare note already referred to, sometimes
single at others double, was not only uttered by the mother when
I approached nest or young in the early days but also occasion-
ally by the other two, who took a sort of family interest in all
that was going on. A cat would generally call forth a modifi-
cation of the ordinary harsh grating cry of the species. But by
far the most interesting was the mother's call to the young when
she wanted them to follow her ; this was invariably obeyed with
extraordinary alacrity, even after the dying bird had become too
weak to fly. If anything could awaken them from their last
sleep it would be this call from mother. It was a low short
frothy spluttering grunt, continuously repeated, something be-
tween the grunt of an infant pig and the spluttering of a lusty
gorged rosy-cheeked baby who really cannot manage any more.
This call was especially urgent at roosting time, and then I had to
stand guard over the young birds in the birdroom until it was
dark, or until I shut the mother out. When shut out, she would
call from the aviary in a raised voice sqitee and squeer. Almost
the only other occasion on which she raised her voice was when
she had, as she thought, lost both her young. Surely they had
wandered, or peradventure they slept and must be awakened, and
the poor creature, wandering about with food in her bill, called
piteously for them ; and it is a great satisfaction to me to feel
that this noble bird is now so happy and contented in the love
and companionship of her firstborn.
The young birds had various calls, sqtcee, squeer , sqzieege,
sqziaaa, ske-orr, coo-raare , craake, coo-raake (vowels as in English),
with many modifications, the accent on the second syllable which
was usually prolonged. From October onwards, when the sur-
vivor had ceased to see any object in hiding or being quiet, it
frequently called out when separated from its mother, aud the
call, although approaching that of the adult, was still easily
distinguishable.
The mother did not carry away the excreta, but the nest
was perfectly sweet and clean when I examined it on the day

following that on which the young had left. In one instance, a
day later, I saw her catch and swallow it. Now she never, as
far as I could see, fed the young on fruit. Did her instinct teach
her that fruit would be inconvenient, and, later, suffering as they
were, that it would be injurious? Since its recover. Baby has
been very fond of banana.
For the information of aviculturists, I may mention that
the breeding female, instead of making life unendurable for
other inmates of the aviary, for the most part treated them--not
being Regents--with indifference. She never liked the Mesias,
and, this year as last, persistently destroyed their nests; yet she
never touched the nest of a Blue-breasted Waxbill which was
built in the same thorn but a foot distant from those of the
Mesias. The tiny Cuba Finches, Phonipara canora , having
reared one young bird, took it into their heads to build a second
nest in an extra large box which needed a great deal of filling.
This box was fixed up tinder the roof of the aviary ; and ever} 1,
time, that is times without number, either of the birds carried
up say a piece of hay, it had to perch for a moment on the long
pole which ran near to the Regent's nest. This irritated the
Regent and she would come out, snatch the hay from the Cuba's
bill, and throw it away in a regular pet. But she soon cooled
down, and the plucky Cubas, who were never discouraged,
brought off a brood of no less than three, an unusual number for
this cold country. The pert little Blue Wren which was bred
here in 1902, and figured with his parents in November of that
year, was wholly unmolested, notwithstanding that, true to his
character of "Impudence" (in the Sydney coloured illustration
of "Dignity and Impudence"--the Laughing Jackass and the
Blue Wren) he rarely failed to hop round the Regent when
cockroaches were put out. The female White-eared Grassfiuch,
figured August, 1898, and various other helpless tots, were never
injured nor interfered with. On the other hand, various birds
had to be removed, not solely on account of temper but also
owing to their assertive dispositions when cockroaches appeared.
Amongst these were the White-throated Ground-Thrush (April,
1904), the Black-lieaded Sibia (June, 1903), the Rufous-chinned
Laughing-Thrush (Trochalopterum rufigtilare), and the like.

0?i the Regent Bird.
When wasp-grubs were put out, the Mesias (October, 1903) had
to be removed to save them from themselves.
The breeding Regent did not fall into active moult until
the middle of September, on her young one being temporarily
taken away from her, and then (a unique experience with a
Regent) the moult came on so rapidly as to incapacitate her
from flying. The system of a bird while she is actually nesting
is not infrequently so engrossed that the breeding energy seems
to sustain the old feathers beyond the normal duration, the moult
following on the removal or abating of the exciting cause. In
this instance, as perhaps usually, only the female was affected,
the male moulting from mid-July to November.
I ought to add, for the information of those who do not
possess Campbell's Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, in which
both nest and eggs are figured, that the nest is--" Flat, slightly
concave; loosely constructed of coarse twigs or dead branchlets,
lined on top with fine brownish twigs and long yellowish wire-
like stems of a climbing plant, the latter being chiefly placed
round the side ; usually situated in dense scrub, at a height of
from twelve to twenty-five feet from the ground." Eggs two in
number, sometimes three ; one is thus described :--" A beautiful,
well-shaped specimen, with texture of shell fine and surface
slightly glossy ; colour, light yellowish-stone, with a faint greenish
tin^e, marked with blotches and spots of sienna or olive-brown,
but chiefly with remarkable hair-like markings of the same
colour, as if a person had painted on the shell fanciful shapes
and figures with a fine brush. Intermingled are a few dull
greyish streaks. All the markings are fairly distributed, being
more abundant round the upper quarter." Another " has mark-
ings like a net-work all over, and finer or more hair-like in
character." Mr. Campbell states that ''The eggs of the Regent
Bird resemble, in a remarkable degree, those of the Spotted
Bower Bird (Chlamydcra maculata&apos;), with the slight difference
that the ground-colour of the eggs of the former is usually
more yellowish in tone."

Munia flaviprymna.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
I first made acquaintance with this species in March of this
year when I came across four in the Insect House of the
Zoological Society which had been deposited by the Hon. Walter
Rothschild.
They struck me as being so extraordinarily like the
Chestnut - breasted Finch in everything except colour that I
formed the hasty and, as it proved, erroneous conclusion that
this species was merely a variant form of the latter. I have since
ascertained however that the Yellow-rumped Finch is quite a
distinct species. The points of identity are however so remark-
able as to be worth reciting, viz. : size, shape and colour of tail,
wings, beak and legs ; size and shape of body; song, love-dance,
and call note. Add to this that in the wild state they are said to
be found together, and that in the aviary the two species are
always associated and sing to one another.
On the 4th of April Mr. Hamlyn sent me a pair of M.
ftavipry 7 nna on approval and, though somewhat doubtful of their
sex, I was so pleased with them that I kept them. Mr. Hamlyn
was good enough also to send me a list of those he had already
sold with their destination and respective prices. Of course it
would be a breach of confidence to quote this list, so I will merely
say that mine cost a small sum compared with the first pair sold.
However it is not always our dearest purchases that turn
out best and, so far as I know, my pair are the only ones that
have made even a partially successful attempt to reproduce their
kind A
I kept mine for a short time in a cage, but they puzzled me
considerably. One was a large bird and the other a small one,
but it was the small one that sang. Now that I know a little
more about them I think I could pick out the sexes without any
difficulty. The hen is much darker (and more streaky) on the

back of the head, whilst the cock has the upper part of the breast
a much brighter, warmer buff than the lower part--the hen having
a uniform shade over the whole of the breast.
I turned the Yellow-rumps out into the Finches' aviary
where they at once fraternized with a pair of Chestnut Finches,
and the four birds almost at once went into a heavy moult.
The so-called hen now began to sing, much to my *
annoyance, so I got another from Mr. Hamlyn which I turned
out on 8th May. I at once saw that Mr. Hamlyn was right and I
was wrong, for the hens fought and the original pair built a nest
w T hicli they completed on 16th May.
The nest was situated in a box shrub, about 4ft. from the
ground and 3ft. from the side of the aviary and was exceedingly
well compacted of long stems of freshly pulled grass, not being
lined in any way. It was elliptical in shape, the longest
axis being horizontal, with a small entrance hole at the side. No
eo-o-s however, were laid and the cock transferred his affections
to the new hen, so I removed the original hen.
The new hen laid, in the last week of June, four eggs
which were pure white in colour and sharply pointed at one end.
The hen sat quite at the back of the nest and the cock was
generally to be seen squatting in the entrance keeping watch and
ward. When the young were hatched (three in number) the
Yellow-rumps were exuberant, darting about the aviary with
loud calls of "pink" "pink."
The 21st of July, was a day of disaster for all my birds.
In the morning I examined the nest carefully and found two
grand young birds quite ready to fly, and one egg. But a tragedy
was at hand. Early next morning I was informed by the
servants that pandemonium had reigned in the aviaries during
night. It appears that several cats had climbed on top of the
roof and had started a panic among the Doves: the cats
had then commenced springing against the wire sides until they
had the whole one hundred and fifty birds flying terror-
stricken in every direction. It was a mournful task collecting
the dead and the dying and the broken eggs. I have never had
a more promising lot of nests than at that time, but, from the

whole number, not one egg hatched and not one young bird flew
except two English Goldfinches.
However, I had learnt a lesson : in the first place the cats
paid very dearly for their night's work, and secondly, I caught
up and disposed of almost all the Doves. Curiously enough I
never found a feather of the young Yellow-rumps though I made
a microscopic search for them. I think they must have flown
against the wire netting and been dragged through.
I ought now to have caught and caged the Yellow-rumps
as they were quite dispirited, and in poor condition for nesting
again, but I foolishly left them, the consequence being that they
built another nest in an aucuba, at the end of August, again
laying four eggs and, when I returned home on October 6th, I
found the poor little hen sitting dead and mummified on three
dead young and one egg.
I trust that others will succeed where I have failed. I am
sending the two eggs by request to the Natural History Museum,
where Dr. Bowdler Sharpe writes me they will " come in useful
for the 5th volume of the Catalogue of eggs."

I have observed that those interested in Cage Birds have
of late years put up large flight aviaries, or kept collections of
their feathered friends more frequently in bird-rooms than in
separate large or small cages.
Before me lies the description of the new Bird-house just
built in the Zoological Park of New York, which is divided into
a number of huge aviaries. In the London Zoological Gardens
there were erected, two years ago, the large Parrots aviary on
the canal bank, and this year the Gulls' aviary and the Wading-
birds' aviary. A number of private aviaries have been described
in the Avicultural Magazine.
Everyone who incurs the expense and trouble of keeping
birds wishes to see his feathered friends as well housed and made
as happy as they can be.

Mr. Aug. F. Wiener,
like to give his birds a maximum of room, and every beginner in
bird-keeping is apt to jump at the idea that his birds will be
happy in proportion to the size of their cages or aviaries, and
happiest in the company of a great many other birds.
As a good many fallacies are at the bottom, as a consequence
of the present tendency to keep birds in large numbers in one
enclosure, a little consideration and discussion of the subject
of cages and aviaries will be timely, interesting and useful.
I quite foresee that many readers of this paper may not
share my views and conclusions, though these ideas are based on
considerable practical experience and long observation.
Very often however more is to be learned from listening to
and weighing opinions contrary to our own, than from listening
to those who think like ourselves. Therefore I trust some of the
following points may contain some matter worth remembering
by readers of this magazine.
Targe aviaries for cage birds may be all very well for
private owners who take a minute interest in every individual
bird they possess and whom the birds know, who can go among
their birds without disturbing them and who will sit down
quietly in their midst, take delight in watching them, the while
planning out what they can do for the birds collectively in the
way of food and protection in conformity with the change of the
season or weather, and what may be necessary for any birds
individually when these require any special attention during
sickness, moulting, etc.
If a stranger comes to view the inhabitants of such an
aviary, and especially if children come who love to make the
birds fly, the latter will retire to corners or hide in bushes and
make themselves invisible.
Large aviaries are certain to be invaded by mice, if not
rats. The former will devour the food destined for the birds and
what they do not eat they will foul, whilst the rats will eat the
food and the birds as well.
The first aviary I possessed was built thirty-five years ago
and I had imagined that its design was beautifully thought out.
It had small fountains, miniature lakes, rockworkwith pockets in
which plants grew, trees and perches af all kinds, nesting-boxes

of every known sort, plenty of seedhoppers, etc. When it was
finished and before the birds were put in, it all looked exceedingly
pretty. The first thing that happened was that the birds ate the
soft plants, and the harder plants soon became covered with dust
and droppings and died. Then came a few young mice who
gained access, though the mesh of the wirework was only half-
an-incli. In spite of the daily warfare against the mice these
increased and multiplied, until they numbered hundreds if not
thousands. They fairly made that first aviary uninhabitable.
As to breeding, what with the number of birds in that aviary and
with the mice no nest came off successfully.
After about three years struggle I had to abandon that
aviary, and I next built a larger one by the light of the previously
gained costly experience.
This time I built of cement, discarding rockwork and
such like refuges of vermin, and divided my aviary into more
than a dozen sub-divisions, besides a considerable number of
separate cages. Instead of planted trees, I put in shrubs in
large pots which enabled me to change them as required. My
endeavours were crowned by fair success, which would however
have been greater had I contented myself with keeping only
half as many birds in each division.
The mortality is and must be considerably greater, and the
chance of breeding is very much smaller in large aviaries than
it is when birds are kept in suitable cages inhabited by one
species only. The characteristic temperament of the different
species varies greatly, and a close observer will find that there is
more individuality in birds of the same kind than is generally
believed.
The cause of the mortality in great aviaries is three-fold,
viz ., over feeding, starvation and injury.
It is not difficult to induce a dog and a cat to eat
occasionally out of the same dish. But if that mode of feeding
were made a daily practise the dog would greedily gobble all the
food, while the cat was thinking about beginning to feed, and in
the end would find an empty dish and starve. Precisely the same
happens in an aviary. Greedy individuals take possession of
the food-dishes and those of a more gentle character starve in

Mr. Aug. F. Wiener,
view of plenty of food. The moulting time of birds differs
considerably. Daring the moult a bird requires warmth, quiet,
and a little extra food, feels sickly and is retiring. It is quite
impossible to tempt a temporarily weak and sickly bird by extra
food in an aviary, because the other birds would eat it. Strong,
healthy birds have little or no compassion on a weak one, will
not only rob him of his food, but too often pluck his feathers
and drive him about and not rarely kill him right out.
As regards breeding, there is little chance in any aviary in
which a variety of birds are housed. During the breeding time
the character of birds changes very much. Quite gentle species
often become combative, and innumerable combats follow. A
pair intent on nesting will first take possession of a branch,
or corner, or nesting box, and establish their rights of domicile
by combat. But whilst building their nest other birds will take
a fancy to their choice of&quot; material, steal it and pull the nest to
pieces. If a nest is made in spite of all interruptions and the
laying of eggs has begun, as soon as the hen leaves her nest
some other bird will look into it out of sheer curiosity and is
often tempted by the warm cosy nest to sit in it. This leads
either to the abandonment of the nest by the rightful owners or
to a fight for its possession during which one or more eggs get
easily broken. When the other birds see a broken fresh egg
they will first examine it curiously, then nibble at and taste it
and will quickly acquire the taste for new laid eggs. From that
moment no more eggs are safe. The taste for them quickly
becomes a mania. I have seen birds following a hen that was
about to lay, sitting outside her nest waiting while she was lay-
ing, driving her away as soon as the egg was laid and instantly
breaking and devouring the egg within a couple of minutes of
its having been laid. Such cannibals must be removed without
delay, or the whole stock will become contaminated. In an
aviary identification of such a culprit is impossible. Birds,
when they want to breed, require above all privacy and seclusion,
if they cannot have that they will fight for it, though either they
themselves or the intruder comes* to grief.
I have more than once seen new birds perfectly dazed and
bewildered when put into one of these aviaries containing a

flock of birds of various kinds, have seen them refuse food and
perish in a few days.
I11 a large aviary very vigorous birds are apt to become
bullies and to make all the other inhabitants miserable. Or in-
dividuals may feed to excess, to their own detriment and result-
in the starvation of other birds. Such individuals, or those
showing signs of impaired health, should be removed as soon as
possible, but as catching them is almost impossible, irreparable
mischief is often done without an) r possibility of arresting it.
I will now briefly discuss the before-mentioned new Public
Bird-houses. Taking them in their order, I begin with the New
York Bird-house opened in July last. It claims "to excel
most other buildings of its kind in the world." About that,
time will judge. The violent fluctuations of the New York
climate are well known. How the birds of all climes which this
house is to shelter will stand a hot spell under that glass roof,
and how a house so large and 36 feet high, is to be kept even a
little warm during the New York blizzards is another matter.
It is intended to diffuse light by growing plants and vines.
This idea would be very pretty if it were only practicable. Who-
ever proposed this cannot have had a very extensive experience
of live birds in confinement. Growing plants means mould for
the plants to grow in, and that mould becomes a refuge for mice
and a prolific breeding-place of these vermin. As regards vines--
perhaps creepers are meant--these must be attached to some-
thing, therefore are not readily removable. If these vines grew
any branch coming within reach of the birds would be at once
nibbled and destroyed. But the vines are not likely to grow,
nor to live. In every bird-house the movement of the birds
raises some very fine dust which will settle on the leaves of
plants and kill them in the course of a season, whilst the
attack on the roots by the mice will kill them from below. The
only possible living plants for a bird-house are hanging baskets
and hardy evergreen bushes in pots, and both must be provided
in duplicate or in triplicate, so as to make an exchange possible
once a week or every fortnight and give the plants time to
recover elsewhere.
The house is stated to contain altogether eighty separate

means sixty-one indoor divisions.

(1) All the Parrots. The Bulletin of the New York Zoo-
logical Society, No. 18, July 1905, in which the new Bird-house
is described speaks of 500 different species of Parrots. I
thought the known species numbered nearer 1,000.
(2) Besides a very large number of Parrots, these 61 indoor
aviary-cages are to contain the following species as enumerated
verbatim in the same Bulletin on page 225 :
"Among the groups of birds which will soon find homes
" in this beautiful building, may be mentioned the Thrushes,
" Warblers, Titmice, Bulbuls, Orioles, Tanagers, Buntings,
"Grosbeaks, Waxbills, Sparrows, Starlings, Bower-birds,
" Crows, Jays, Larks, Hornbills and Toucans, Woodpeckers,

"Quail and Partridges, Sand-Grouse, Tinamous, the Sand-

Further on a colon} 7 of a dozen Terns diving for fish in a
specially large cage are mentioned, also Skylarks, Mocking and
other specially North American song-birds are spoken of, and I
011I3 7 wonder that Albatross, Pelicans, Storks, Gulls, Owls and
Birds of Prey, Pheasants and Foreign Fowls are omitted.
Before copying that new American Bird-house in European
Zoological Gardens, it would be well to wait a couple of years
and to ascertain then how many of the crowd of birds housed in
the first year were alive a year later, and whether it has fulfilled
the hopes of its designers.
It is permissible to put a great number of stuffed speci-
mens into a glass case in a Museum, but quite a different thing
to keep living creatures in good health in an aviary if stocked
by a great variety of species.
A large open-air aviary which will be known to nearly
every reader of the Avicultural Alagazine is the " Canal Bank,"
or large Parrots' Flight Aviary at the London Zoo. This huge
structure was planned before the gentleman on whom the
management of the London Zoological Gardens now devolves
had been appointed.

Its design and object were so evidently well meant that it
seems ungracious to criticise. It was expected to be a great
boon to the Parrots to exchange their usual solitary cages with
the vast space of a huge and high enclosure. And it was also
anticipated that it would greatly interest the public to see
gorgeous Parrots of many kinds flying about in a state of semi-
freedom. This latter hope it has amply fulfilled, and it has
proved a popular exhibit. It has also proved that Parrots of
the larger kinds, even if born in tropical countries, are not
nearly so sensitive as regards cold temperature as they were
originally supposed to be. But with these remarks I fear all is
said that can be said in favour of this aviaiy.
In their wild state most Parrots spend their time in climb-
ing about in the crests of trees, using their wings only when
disturbed or when in search of food. They live in pairs, or in
families or flocks of the same kind, and not only do the}&apos;&apos; not
associate with other species of Parrots but as a rule are intensely
jealous. I firmly believe that the Parrots in that big "Canal
Bank" aviary are not a bit happy, and that even the large
Sulphur-crested Cockatoos which flop around screaming would
have been much happier if each had been in a smaller cage
of his own, and had been petted and talked to, and fed by a
succession of visitors.
A bird's plumage is an infallible criterion of its health
and happiness. The feathers of none of the birds in that aviary
ever looked as neat and tight as those of similar Parrots in the
Parrot-house. At first the trees were wrecked and destroyed,
next the Cockatoos could be seen pulling out the grass with the
roots, and then the wood shelters put up for their protection, and
the nest-boxes were attacked.
Unfortunately some 3&apos;oung rats somehow obtained access
into the aviary and, increasing rapidly, could, in course of time,
be seen running about in broad daylight, and in prime, very fat
condition. Any young bird, and any sickly old bird, fell an easy
prey to these vermin, and such birds simply disappeared down the
rats' holes. Not a single bird could be reared. If some Parrots
could have been bred in that aviary it would have been interest-
ing to watch how the young generation accommodated them-

Mr. Aug. F. Wiener,
selves to the local conditions and climate. Whether the old birds,
who have endured one winter better than could be anticipated,
will survive another winter without much more protection is an
open question.
For those who take some minute interest in the various
species, such aviaries afford little or no chance of gathering
information or knowledge, owing to the distance of the birds and
the consequent difficulty of identification.
Breeding and rearing a brood in such an aviary is
hopeless. The few birds that were bred were either eaten by
rats as soon as they left the nest or destroyed by Cockatoos who
developed a carnivorous appetite. If half the cubic space of that
aviary had been divided into twenty partitions, hundreds of
young Parrots might have been bred and reared successfully in
fuller view of the public and of students.
The Gulls' aviary is superb in design and looks well
adapted to its purpose. It attracts wild Gulls who appear very
desirous to join their relations in captivity and to share their
good food, if they could only find ways and means to constitute
themselves prisoners or pensioners of the Zoological Society.
Some little additional shelter for exceptionally rough weather
would possibly be advisable, when we think of a spell of very
cold weather accompanied by sleet or snow.
It is asserted that Gulls require no shelter. But the
Penguins, in the adjoining Seal Pond enclosure, can be seen
of an evening to creep into crevices of the Rockwork for pro-
tection against severe weather, though Penguins are probably as
fit to withstand inclement weather as any Gulls.
The Waders and European wild birds' aviary is indeed
beautiful and the ideal of the kind of aviary a gentleman might
like to have in his own grounds. That some of the many
song-birds it contains are very rarely seen, and that it would
require a week's patient watching to see all the birds that
are enumerated on the little nameplates as inhabiting the
enclosure in summer, is in this case not a serious drawback, for
anybody really interested in British birds has seen most of these
in the fields or can see them if he cares to look for them.
The latest addition to the Bird-houses at the Zoo are the

new Owls' cages, and these seem to be an entire success in every
way. The Owls look thoroughly happy and comfortable and
could not be in finer condition. They appear to enjoy sun-
shine as well as a shower, and when they have had enough of
these they retire to their shelters where they can choose dark
corners or a view of the outer world. The}&apos;' wink at their visitors
and seem to say " Took at us and see how pretty and how com-
fortable we are."
Suppose this row of cages were thrown into one huge
enclosure, the case would be very different. The public could not
see them as well, and the Owls would not be as happy.
The designer of these Owls' cages knew precisely what
Owls require and deserves a vote of thanks from those birds and
the public.
Within the next few months the construction of a new
house for Foreign Cage-birds will be taken in hand at the Zoo.
The small and very beautiful foreign finches were in the past
unaccountably neglected at the Toudon Zoological Gardens. In
former years a few were shown in small, totally unsuitable cages
in the Parrot house. When these were abolished, they were all
herded together in one of the three-wired divisions in the
Insect-house where their beauty could not be seen well owing to
insufficient light. When this space was required for the Birds of
Paradise their already diminished number was crowded into one
large cage, and finally the few that were left were transferred
back to the Parrot-house, for want of more suitable accommo-
dation.
As regards the effect of intelligent care on cage birds, the
article over the signature of Mr. Meade-Waldo in the November
number of the Avicultural Magazine contains hints which every
keeper of, or attendant on, cage birds ought to remember and
take to heart. By studying the individuality of cage birds, even
the most delicate species can be kept in separate cages or divi-
sions for more years in perfect health than they will endure
months in crowded cages with a mixed population.
About the appropriate size of cages very hazy ideas pre-
vail. Not one person in ten could tell off-hand the breadth,
depth and height of the cage in which a pet canary lived many

in length, 15 inches in depth, and 24 inches high is a world
for a pair of small birds, in which they can be as happy&apos;,
nay&apos; even happier, than in a big park. In such a home they
can be seen, admired and studied, and if properly cared for they
will feel sure of their food, free from persecution of their natural
enemies, and will in due time, when property tended, proceed
to nest and breed a progeny&apos;. I estimate that even delicate
small finches live about five times as long, when kept in pairs
as they do when kept with other species ; and I would never
think of putting rare and valuable birds into aviaries inhabited
by a number of species.
Very careful observation, during the last ten years, of a
variety of exotic Finches, kept in a so-called aviary cage in niv
sitting room, have made it clear to me that, if several kinds were
housed in the same enclosure, the birds would just feed and pass
their time in sitting listlessty on perches, rarely if ever showing
the beauty of their form and plumage, or the grace of their
natural movements, whilst, if onty one species was kept, all the
natural way^s and habits of these birds could be seen and studied
by observing specimens in the enjoyment of perfect health living
in complete happiness.
A somewhat sentimental idea, culminating in a doubt
whether ati}^ birds should be kept in confinement at all, is now
prevailing among ladies, and evidently cultivated in a good man}&apos;
superior establishments for the education of rising generations
of the gentle sex. These good and kind souls have probably
never given it a thought or never heard how many wild birds
are destroyed by their natural enemies, such as birds of prey,
foxes, cats, serpents, etc.; what immense numbers perish
miserabty through want of food in winter, or during the long
migrations many species have to undertake in search of food
with the change of seasons.
Intelligently housed and domesticated cage birds are
protected from all these ills and ampty fed all the y&apos;ear round.
If cared for as they ought to be by those who have charge of
them, most species will be perfectly happy in confinement, and
live longer than in freedom. There is a small Cockatoo at the

one, 35 years ago, which only recently died of old age. Small&apos;
finches have been known to live six and eight years in cages if
their wants have been properly studied, all of which cases prove
that with sufficient room for exercise, suitable food and intelligent
care birds in cages can enjoy long life, which is the best proof of
their enjoyment of health and happiness.
But let no one undertake the care of a caged creature who-
is not able and willing to ensure that it receives at all times all
the care and intelligent attention required.
[The subject dealt with in tlie above article is a very important one,
especially at the present time, when it is proposed to erect, almost
immediately, a special house for small birds at the Zoological Gardens. It
is very desirable that members should freely express their views on the
matter of the most suitable sizes for cages and aviaries; whether it is
desirable that each species should be separately caged, or whether several
allied forms should be kept together in good-sized flights. We hope that
the subject will be freely discussed in this journal.-- Ed.].
HUMMING BIRD AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
The arrival of a living Humming Bird at the Zoological Gardens is
an event of great avicultural interest and importance, though it is some-
what ancient history now, and most of our members have read all about it
in the daily and weekly papers.
This bird, a specimen of the Bolivian Violet-eared Humming Bird
(.Petasophora iotaia ) arrived at the Gardens on November 25th last. During
the train journey from Southampton ever}&apos; effort was made to keep the
bird warm, by placing foot-warmers etc. round the cage, but in spite of all
care, on arrival it was in a state of collapse from the cold; but it imme-
diately recovered when placed in a warm place by the liot-water pipes in
the Insect House.
At a meeting of the Zoological Society on November 28th Captain
Pam gave an interesting account of his attempt to import living Humming
Birds. These are caught by the Natives with limed twigs, and many
attempts have been made to keep them in captivity in Venezuela, but with
very limited success. Capt. Pam fed his Humming Birds on sugar and
water to which was added a certain amount of extract of meat as a substi-
tute for insects; and this treatment succeeded well. He started from
Venezuela with some half-dozen of these birds, all of which had lived with
him for some time before starting. On arrival at Southampton one only

no Humming Bird at the Zoological Guldens.
survived. This bird lived for a fortnight in the Insect House, but, in spite
of every attention, succumbed during the recent damp foggy weather.
Captain Pam deserves the hearty congratulations of aviculturists for
his success, though this was far less than he deserved to achieve. Success
in importing these delicate denizens of the tropics is only to be attained as
the result of infinite pains and unremitting attention to their every need
during the voyage home.
Although this is the first living Humming Bird to reach the
Zoological Gardens others have reached England. Gould, the great orni-
thologist who wrote a magnificent monograph on this group of birds,
*crossed the Atlantic in 1S57 in a sailing ship with a pair of the North
American Ruby-tliroated species (Trochilus colubris). One died just before
reaching land, while the other lived two or three days in London.
There is an earlier record given by Latham, that all practical avi-
culturists will accept with reserve. He states that a female Humming Bird
was discovered sitting on its nest and eggs in Jamaica. The nest, eggs and
sitting bird were removed bodily to a ship bound for England, 011 which
the bird hatched and reared her brood of two, both of which reached
England alive and survived for some time !
Again another record is reported by Mr. Pocock in the Field of Dec-
ember 9th, iS . He writes: " .Since the question of the importation Hum-
ming Birds is under discussion it seem a pity not to record the fact that in
July, 1S94, eleven specimens of Trochilus cornutus, which I presume to be
the Heliactin cornuta of Sclater and Salviu's list, were brought over on the
s.s. Nile and bought by Mr. Arthur W. Arrowsmith, who sold them to the
late Mr. Erskine Allon, of Gray's Inn."
Yet another case has come under my notice: The Rev. Hubert D.
Astley wrote to me to say that the late Mr. Cholmondeley of Coudover in
Shropshire had a number of Humming Birds alive many years ago. I
therefore wrote to Miss Mary Cholmondeley&apos;, the well-known authoress,
asking if she could give me any information on the subject and if there was
any doubt as to their being genuine Humming Birds, and she has most
kindly sent me the following particulars. She writes: "My only regret is
that I can give you but little information respecting the Humming Birds
which my uncle, the late Mr. Cholmondeley of Coudover imported in large
numbers.
" My father, the Rev. R. H. Cholmondeley, brother to Mr. Cholmondeley
of Coudover, remembers the importation. We believe them to have been
genuine Humming Birds--on this point we have never had any doubt.
They mostly either died on the journey&apos; or soon after arrival. One of my
sisters remembers seeing some of them alive at Coudover, but only for a
short time.
" '1 he great difficulty&apos; was the food. I have heard my uncle speak of
that difficulty, but not of how he solved it. But as, in spite of repeated
trials the birds always died I fear he did not solve it."

THE ADVENTURES OF A CURLEW.
By Mrs. GREGORY.
The unexpected often happens, even in bird - keeping ! I did not
think to be the possessor of a live Curlew at a moment's notice.
Just as it was getting dusk last Thursday a policeman rang at the
door-bell and asked to speak to me. In his arms he carried a very fine
Curlew. He said it had been found at the Sandbanks two miles away, and
seemed to think it had walked into Parkstone and into his own little garden
where he caught it. He brought it to me as he could "do nothing with it,"&apos;
and thought I would "give it a home," adding, "you can pick it np your-
self as I did, for it is quite tame." The poor bird was dazzled by the bright
light of the room and hopped mournfully into a corner. It let me take it
up, and I thought the best thing was to put it at once into a run, in which
are a couple of very tame and gentle Silver Pheasant hens. I did not quite
know what to give for food, and it was too late to send for any; but
shrimps for the Flamingoes are always at hand, so I put a few and a little
bread and milk ready for the new comer, but it would not eat.
Next morning I saw that the right wing drooped : the bird had been
slightly injured and could not fly properly. I feared it would mope and
pine if shut in wire, so I opened the aviary door and it walked out escorted
by the two Pheasants. These Silver hens have the entire run of the garden
for hours at a time, and I have no difficulty in getting them back, as they
will follow if I call or let me drive them in at any moment. A week ago
one got over the wall and was found in a garden some little distance off.
She flew back of her own accord ; the other Pheasant at once ran across
the lawn to meet her, offered her a worm, and the two walked quietly back
together into their own run.
But I must return to my Curlew. Now began the first of his troubles.
I had hoped they were at an end, and that he would now make himself happy,
and search for his own worms and slugs with his long slender sensitive bill,
bathe in the nice shallow pond all ready for him, and make himself happv.
But those already in possession thought otherwise. First the three Demoiselle
Cranes walked up to drive away the intruder. They were followed by the
Common Crane. He rushed with open bill at the poor Curlew, and would
have ' gone for him ' had I not promptly&apos;interferred. I carried the perse-

cuted one to a sheltered part of the garden shut off by a door from the
other birds. Here I placed food and water, and as I left him I saw a black
cat, just above on the roof of a summer-house, watching me and watching
the Curlew ! I drove it off, and thought and hoped the bird was big
*enough to take care of itself. Towards evening we heard piercing cries of
distress. I hurried to the garden and saw the same cat just ready to spring
on to the bird, who still cried loudh 7 . The cat slunk away. But now the
difficulty was to find the Curlew, which had hidden under the gooseberry
bushes in the darkness. Eventually he was found and carried back in
triumph to the aviary, without the slightest resistance on his part.
Since writing the above (a fortnight ago) the Curlew has become so
tame that he will run up to me when I call him. I can now let him loose
in the garden for some hours at a time, and he will go back into the run of
his own accord. He eats almost from my hand, and has made himself so
thoroughly at home that he will even take his bath in the pond. The
Cranes are gradually becoming friendly towards him.

NATURE IN EASTERN NORFOEK. #

<bodyText confidence="0.91374765" page_id="32720511"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
To many students of wild-bird life the expanse of reed-
fringed waters, the bleak sand-hills and mud-flats of Eastern
Norfolk possess a unique attraction, for here some of the most
interesting of our rarer birds make their home, or at least spend
a certain time during their spring or autumn migration. No one,
however, has had better opportunities of studying wild nature in
this favoured district, or could well have used his opportunities
better, than the author of the volume now under notice.
The first thirteen pages of Mr. Patterson's book are auto-
biographical, and give a very interesting insight into the author's
life. His father was a shoemaker living in a typical Yarmouth
\0x25A0" Row," where the cats were the young naturalist's first play-
mates. But he loved all living creatures, and sought every
opportunity of getting away to the fields, the marshes, or his
beloved Breydon Water, where he could study nature's ways to
his heart's content. When eight years old he had saved two-
pence with which he purchased a small book, whose pages

"swarmed with pictures of Elephants, Owls, Crocodiles, and
other creatures." The contents were soon known by heart, and
engrafted in the youthful breast a passion for nature which has
grown with him. Many a time has starvation stared our author
in the face; yet, in spite of obstacles which, by most people
would have been considered insurmountable, he managed to
make time to pursue his studies of wild creatures. The result
of this is that Mr. Patterson has done some most valuable work
in more than one branch of natural history, and has proved
himself to be one of the best observers of the day.
The present volume is full of valuable observations on the
natural history of this district, and many anecdotes relating to
the very interesting class of men, now almost extinct, who
in 3&apos;ears gone b}L obtained a living by wildfowling on Breydon.
With the increase of population, the drainage of the
marshes and other causes, the number of rare birds visiting
Eastern Norfolk is far less than was the case some half a century
ago, but even now several species are found which can be
observed nowhere else in Great Britain. The celebrated and
ever delightful Broads are the home of the Bearded Tit, a most
charming little bird that has been ruthlessly and shamefully
persecuted by collectors, but which, thanks to the protection
afforded it in recent years, holds its own well, and even seems to
be increasing. Every year, on the Spring migration, Spoonbills
visit the Breydon mud-flats, sometimes being joined by Avocets.
Mr. Patterson's book is delightful reading, and its value is
much increased by the series of beautiful coloured drawings by
Mr. Frank Southgate.

A BOURKE'S PARRAKEET ILL.
Sir, --It maj&apos; be of some use to report to our members my treatment
of a male Bourke's Parrakeet (Neophema bourkei), suffering apparently
from a chill on the stomach, which caused indigestion.

half closed and lustreless. I noticed that the canary seed eaten by it passed
through the body almost entirely undigested, I tried to give it "Marie"

biscuit sopped in scalded milk, and squeezed rather dry, but it would touch
nothing of the kind, neither would it drink; for these Parrakeets seem to
drink hardly at all; so that, in spite of what some bird authorities say as to
the uselessness of physic etc. for sick birds, I determined to try something,
as I felt sure the bird would succumb if I didn't, for he had been ailing
some four or five da}'S, and was daily growing worse ; losing flesh rapidly.
First of all I administered a dose, two to three drops, of warm castor
oil. An hour afterwards I gave two or three drops of warm milk, having
put into the milk a soupcon of good brandy. The bird was very weak. I
kept him as warm as possible, and at night placed him in a basket on a hot-
water bottle of gutta perclia, well wrapped round with two pieces of flannel
so that the heat should not be too much for the Parrakeet, and also so that
it should be longer retained. It was indeed still quite warm in the morning.
Twice during the night, with that instinct of being able to wake one-
self when one has ordered one's brain to remember something particular
even in sleep, I arose, warmed some milk and administered three drops.
The next morning the little Bonrke was better; not so puffed out, and ran
out of the basket almost briskly. I continued the treatment through that
day, and then left him for the night in his cage, with a lamp burning close
by, giving him canary seed into which I had mixed some olive oil; for
nothing but seed would he touch, and he had subsisted two days and a
night, only on the drops of brandied milk that I had put down his throat
on my linger.
For three or four more days he looked decidedly poorly, but better;
and then I changed the olive oil in the canary seed, for cod-liver oil: of
course a very little goes a long way. And I also forced him to drink a little
tepid water, into which I had put a few drops of glycerine and two or three
of ipecac. And he recovered! Hubert D. Asteey.

Sir, --Is it usual for birds to have two nests and for the cock and hen
to sit on each nest at the same time ?
My Talpacoti Doves have done so. The hen first had a nest in some
bushes near the door, and every time one went in to feed the birds it would
fly up and so leave the nest. It then laid two eggs in an old nest close by,
which no sooner did the cock bird see than he at once went and sat on
them, and the hen on the other nest close by.
This is not the only instance I have noticed, as the Australian
Pigeons have done exactly the same thing. The hen in this case laid in
one nest, and then took it into her head to lay in an old nest which the
cock bird took possession of. Unfortunately in both cases nothing came of
the eggs the cock sat on.
I thought at first it was because the Talpacoti Dove was so often

disturbed, but this does not seem to be the case, as the Australian Crested
Doves built in an undisturbed place. C. Castee-Seoane.
[It is unnatural and unusual for Doves, or other birds, to behave like
this. I11 the natural course Doves take turns on the nest, the male sitting
most of the day, and the female at night, hence it would be an impossibility
for both nests to succeed. --Ed.].
THE WILD CANARY.
Sir, --As an apology for these further notes, I may say that I otfered
(through a mutual friend) to reply in his own journal to Dr. Creswell, but
received no answer.
In reply to his Editorial remarks on " The Wild Canary " in the
November issue of Bird Notes may I point out that my adopting a nom de
plume was done in accordance with Dr. Creswell's own wish, (see p. 136 of
same work, where he recommends "writers who have not previously
written before and are doubtful of their style to take a noin de plume.")
Surely what stands good for one journal ought not to be found fault with in
another : this answer also disposes of the paragraph about the war fleet etc.
With regard to crowding out his important letter on Avian Tuberculosis, my
notes were written early in August and were in the printer's hands before
the end of that month, whereas the Editor informs me that Dr. Creswell's
important contribution did not reach him until Sept. 6th or 7U1, so that my
communication went in on priority.
The errors pointed out were originally looked up in Prof. Newton's
" Dictionary of Birds" and verified in the Library of the Zoological Society
(which Dr. Creswell, as a Fellow, is entitled to use). Although Dr. Creswell
lays the blame on his authorities they are correctly given by them, also he
might have deducted from the length of my paper, the portion taken up
by Canon Tristram's Notes from The Ibis occupying one-third of the paper,
and which are about the best original matter that has been issued recently
on the wild bird.
Dr. Creswell carefully evades the points which I proved : (1) his
numerous mistakes and misquotations, and (2) that the wild stock does
contain green in its plumage.
Further, it reduces the period, given by him, of 500 years as the time
during which the Canary has been domesticated to about 300, as they were
personally unknown to Gesner (1555), or Aldrovanus (1610), and Willoughby
(1976) is the first of his authorities to speak of them being fairly common.
After Dr. Creswell writing that he had not seen ail)&apos; of these works it
is curious to refer to Bird Notes, Vol. II., p. 236, where he writes, " I have
searched all the oldest literature we have on the subject ."
These conflicting statements serve admirably to shew the value of his
remarks, and as Dr. Creswell invited criticism ( Bird Notes, Vol. IV., p. 137,

Sir, --I fear I cannot agree with Mr. Slater that tfie effectiveness of
tfie coloured plates is seriously marred by their backgrounds. To begin with,
I do not see where tfie "darkness " comes in.
Why sfiould birds be portrayed with a lack of artistic and natural
surroundings, any more than human beings ? In tfie portraits of Sir
Joshua Reynolds and Gainsborough and other great artists, tfie contour
and likeness of a man or woman is not "seriously effected " because of tfie
sylvan scenery or otherwise, as an adjunct. Indeed, in tfie case of pictures
of birds, such adjuncts seem to be more necessary, because apart from tfie
artistic touch which is imparted to them, one is much helped to realize tfie
habits of tfie bird whose portrait is drawn or painted. I am thankful
that we are passing by tfie time when birds of every possible kind were
placed on a piece of earth, or a bare twig, in pictures. Take, for example,
Mr. Gronvold's drawing of tfie Regent Bird in tfie December Magazine. In
that picture, tfie surroundings are rather more extensive and elaborate than
usual; and, although uncoloured, where does tfie "darkness" come in to
effectively mar tfie portrait ? On tfie contrary, it immediately gives one an
idea of what tfie bird is like in its own native country.
As to tfie picture of tfie Red-capped Parrots, tfie contour of both male
and female is absolutely defined and clear, and gives you a most excellent
portrait. Natural surroundings also help in tfie proportions.
I wanted to do a pair of Pygmy Doves, which are no larger than an
American Blue Robin. To put them on a twig (a la " Morris's British
Birds ") would give one no idea of their diminished size; with nothing to
compare them with, they might for all anyone knows who has never seen
them, be tfie size of a Crowned Pigeon, I portrayed them sitting under tfie
blossom of a cactus.
There is nothing more unwelcome to one's eye than a thoroughly
unnatural photograph ; photographs such as were taken thirty&apos; years ago,
with a man or a woman standing close to a vulgar-looking pedestal, one

hand hanging down, and the other placed (evidently by the photographer)
on the pedestal ! Sham flowers in an impossible vase, and perhaps a
ragged old mat supposed to be grass. Compare those photographs with the
modern ones by some of the best photographers. The early ones were
dreadful because utterly unnatural. So too with pictures of birds sitting on
nothing but an oval of ground the size of a five shilling-piece.
So too with a stuffed bird pinned on to a square block of wood ; and
compare those with the birds at the Natural History Museum, stuffed with
their natural surroundings and in natural positions.
I have been looking through the back numbers of the last two years,
and I am obliged to confess that I cannot find one single portrait of a bird
which is not most clearly defined both in colour and form, etc., and which
would not lose very greatly in beauty and other ways could one suddenly
blot out any adjuncts, and leave the bird sitting on nothing but a bare bit
of branch.

Sir, --I purchased from Green, of Covent Garden, early last summer,
a pair of Scaly-breasted Colins, Callipepta squamata. After having been
kept for a little while in an aviary they were liberated in the garden
enclosure. Here they went to nest under a shelter of thorns and bracken
on the side of a dry bank. O11 August 12, eleven nestlings were hatched
out of a total of thirteen eggs. I cannot describe the nestling downy
plumage as I was away when they were hatched, but that of a bird ten days
old, of which I have a skin, is very curious, not showing the very smallest
resemblance to that of the old birds: no suggestion of grey, but light ochre
sides of head, with broad baud of vandvke brown from back of crest-
feathers (even at this age developing!) right down back of head. Back,
scapulars and wing-coverts brown, with central longitudinal stripe.
They became strong on the wing, flying up to feed, and some of them
flew right out into the garden, over the 6ft. wire netting, but were captured,
brought back and had their wings cut.
The brood was a late one ; the weather about as bad as it well could
be, and one by one they died, the last survivor on October 19th. The
parent birds are well, are still out of doors, and, like the Common Quails,
Chukors, Cholmley's Partridge, and other birds in the same enclosure,
appear quite indifferent to cold.
Our part of Hampshire has suffered ever since last autumn from a
plague of bank voles and short-tailed field mice. Every day we take them
in the traps; the Barn Owls, which are numerous here (bred in the boxes)
catch numbers of them, but the plague goes on. I refer to this for the sake
of saying that each morning, as soon as I begin whistling up the birds for
their feed, two bank voles at once come out, one from either side of the

Mr. Gill much regrets that on account of the pressure of his
professional duties he is unable to continue to make Post mortem exami-
nations of birds free of charge as formerly. At the urgent request of the
Committee, however, he has consented to do them as a matter of business
at a charge of one shilling for each bird, or 2/6 if a reply bt- post is
required. Poultry, domestic Pigeons, and Canaries can only be reported on
by post as they are outside the province of this journal. The Committee
wish to very heartily thank Mr, Gill for the great services he has rendered
to the Society since he undertook the Post mortems.
RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case, and a fee of 1/- for each bud. If a reply by post is required a fee of 2/6 must
be enclosed. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries can only be reported on by
post.

By L. M. Seth-Smith, B.A., M.B.O.U.
I propose in these notes to give a rough outline of a trip
I have just made from Jinja to Mbale. Jinja is a small station
on the north coast of Bake Victoria, about eight hours by
steamer from Entebbe. (Perhaps some of our readers were not
aware that there are steamers on the lake, but I can only advise
them to come for a trip on the Uganda Railway and round the
lake on one of the U. R. Company's Steamers to see for
themselves. They will not regret it.) It is here the White Nile
rises, and about a quarter of a mile down the river from the
lake are the fine Ripon Falls.
The birds round Jinja vary considerably from those at
Entebbe though I was unable to stay long enough to do much
collecting.
One conspicuous little bird which I had not see at Entebbe
but which I found was fairly common all the way to Mbale, was
a Flycatcher* of a light slaty blue colour and with a longish tail,
which, together with its wings, it opened like a fan as it hopped
about the branches in search of food.
Here, as everywhere, are the delightful Wagtails which I
think are the most universally popular birds out here, being
very tame and often coming into one's room, and also having a
very pretty little song.
I have not yet mentioned where or what Mbale is. It is
the Government station farthest east in the Protectorate, and is
within twenty to thirty miles of Mount Elgon, and from it one
Elminia ieresita.

Mr. L. M. Seth-Smith,
can now and then get a good view of the mountain, but the
summit is usually in clouds. It is about eighty-five to ninety
miles from Jinja, and takes usually six days. At the first camp,
about fourteen miles out, there were very few birds. It may have
been that, there being a large quantity of Water Buck, I preferred
these to the birds. All along here perhaps the commonest bird
is Bayard's Bulbul ; in fact it is a positive nuisance, as at a
distance it is impossible to identify it and one goes up expecting
to get hold of some rare bird, and it is only Bayard's Bulbul.
However, by its flight and the fact that it goes about almost
universally in pairs, one gets to know it in time. Another bird
which I have found very deceptive is the hen Weaver-bird, and
suppose I must have shot more of these than any other bird.
The next camp is Iganga where there is a Mission Station.
Near here I shot a species of Turnix which, I regret to say, my
" boy " absolutely spoilt in skinning. At this camp there are a
few Guinea Fowl which are more or less common all up the
road. They are most stupid birds as, after being flushed, they
usually fly up into some leafless tree and wait for you to go up
and shoot them. This, of course, is not ' sporting,' but when
the ' pot ' depends on one's gun, which it often does as regards
fresh meat, one can only be thankful that they are so stupid.
Curiously in some parts they are very wild.
On the way to the next camp, Kelele's, one passes several
swamps, through one of which is quite a wide flowing stream.
Here I managed to shoot a pair of Pigmy Geese,* most charming
little birds, a duck, a Pelican and a white Stork. It is curious
what a few ducks one comes across out here, in spite of the large
swamps. When I first saw the Pelicans they were sailing about
at a great height, and I should not have recognised them at first
except that I had seen one of those unfortunate St. James' Park
birds sailing about in exactly the same way some three years ago.
I noticed here two kinds of Kingfishers,! the large blue one and
the little purple one ; J the latter evidently had a nest under the
bridge, but it was impossible to get under to look for it. A third
kind of Kingfisher, not unlike the large blue one, but smaller

and not quite so brilliant,* evidently, I think, gets its food by
thrusting its beak into soft ground. What its food is I have
not yet found out, but its beak is always covered with earth both
inside and out.
About ten miles after leaving Kelele's the Mpologoma
is crossed; this is an immense swamp full of Papyrus, through
which a narrow channel has been cut for canoes. The canoe
journey used to take about f-liour but now it only takes
about five minutes, after which one walks across on Papyrus
which has been laid down forming a kind of path. As soon as
I had started across here it began to rain in real tropical style,
and I got the most thorough soaking through that I have ever
had.
At Masangauo's, the camp one reaches soon after crossing,
there are an immense number of Guinea Fowl, and from here
onward one is in the Quail country. The natives catch these
quailsf by hundreds by means of call-birds and nooses set in the
grass. The call-birds are put in small cages which are hung on
a pole from thirty to forty feet long and every bird caught is
put in a cage and hung up with the rest (see illustration).
One sees as many as twenty cages on one pole. In each cage
the natives also put a shell and stone, and perhaps a small
piece of wood. On asking the reason&apos;for this I was told that the
bird moving about made these things rattle, and that this makes
the birds call. The Quails have quite a high market value, and
I believe about a hundred go to buy a wife. The natives are
quite clever at catching birds. Twice on the road I met men
with baskets full of Green Fruit Pigeons ,\ say a dozen in each.
I could not quite understand how they had caught them, but
apparently it was when they came to water, and I think with
nooses. I have never yet seen these birds on the ground and I
fancy that they only come to drink.
About here I came upon the Senegal Turtle Dove (Turtur
senegalensis ) and also a pretty little Long-tailed Dove  ||which
seemed very fond of the road.

Notes 071 a Trip in Uga?ida.
I was now on Elephant tracks for about twenty miles, now
and then coming on quite fresh ones, but I was unlucky in not
seeing the animals. There are some large swamps round here, a
noted breeding place for Elephants.
Kangao's is the last camp along the road before reaching
Mbale, and here the tracks were everywhere. There were some
large Parrakeets about here, always in pairs, but they were very
wild, and I was unable to identify them. I managed to shoot
one but could not find it in the long grass. One loses a great
many birds in this way.
And now we get to Mbale ; and the first bird we notice is
a large black Crow with crescent shaped white patch on the back
of neck. This is a larger bird than the black and white Crow
common all over the country, which latter has the whole of its
breast and belly white, as well as the white patch on the neck.
On the north, south and west a level plain stretches out as far
as the eye can reach, but on the east about a mile distant is a
mass of perpendicular rock perhaps three miles long by 2,000
to 3,000 feet high, with one or two lovely waterfalls down the
face of the rock. I was able to get up to the top one day for a few
hours and had a most delightful time. When once on the top one is
in an entirely new country, nothing but hill and dale as far as one
can see; such a change from the flat country one has left 3,000
feet below. Streams run down every valley producing luxuriant
vegetation. I did not see very many birds, but am sure there
must be a great number if only one had time to work property.
I noticed one beautiful Sun-bird with a tail four to five inches
long, but could not get anywhere near it. I shot one olive
green one with dark blue breast which I have not seen elsewhere.
I also noticed several Shrikes. There seems to be a large
number of these throughout the county. By-the-bye, I had
four nestling Shrikes* given me some time ago which I kept in a
cage for some weeks and then let out. One I gave to a friend,
but it either flew away or was taken by the cat soon after; one
of mine was killed either by a parrot or puppy, but the other two
throve wonderfully, and used to come flying on to my shoulder
whenever I went outside. I fed them on cut up meat and insects
Lanins excubitorius.

swept from the grass, their favourite ones being grasshoppers.
If they got a big one they held it in one of their feet, balancing
themselves by throwing out a wing, at the same time resting on
their " knees." When I left Entebbe they were quite well and
used to roost in a tree close by. I hope to find them about still
when I return.
P.S.--There is a very fine and common Lark* throughout
the country with yellow breast and belly, and a black patch on
the breast in the male, which, in the female is reduced to a few
black spots. On one that I shot I found a large number of
minute ticks. I have never noticed them on birds before,

THE REGENT BIRD.
Sericulus melinus.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
f Continued from page 96 J.
I must now wind up with some remarks concerning the
3^oung birds, which, however uninteresting to the general reader,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.972934" page_id="32720528"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
should be placed on record for future reference.
I am here faced with certain practical difficulties ; and
chief among them is that from their first appearance in the open
the developments and changes, infinitesimal and undiscernible
day by day, were continuous at any rate up till nearly the end of
November. Moreover, a Regent objects to being watched or
carefully looked at--it is always conscious of one's presence, and
anything of that kind arouses its innate suspicions.
When the two young birds left the nest their legs and
wings were well developed, so that they could hop and jump
well and strongly ; within a day or so they could fly, and very
soon could fly well. They kept entirely to the trees (as long as
they were allowed to live naturally), and did not willingly
approach the ground for a very long time. Coming out of a
nest in a bushy tree in a subtropical climate, all would have been

Mr. R. Phillipps,
suitable and for the best ; it was our cruel weather they were
unable to withstand. And their slow development should not be
overlooked. These two points, it seems to me, throw light on
the failure of Mrs. Johnstone to rear the young of Fraser's
Touraco in 1904 (N.S. III., p. 26) and again in 1905, and also the
young Satin-birds in 1902 (N.S. I., p. 63). Writing from niemorj&apos;,
the feet legs and thighs of the latter were quite exceptionally
developed; but the full significance of the point did not occur
to me when I wrote the account that appeared at page 66.
The actual bodies of the young Regents were better
clothed than were the young Satin-birds at nearly double the age,
but their thighs and necks were practically naked. The orifices
of the ears were horribly open and exposed to the cold ; it was
not until quite the end of September that anything worthy of
the name of ear-coverts could be seen, these not being fully
grown until well into October. The nostrils were covered and
hidden. The feathers of the tail were slow to appear, first
peeping out about August 28; but by September 8 those of the
elder bird were free and full, and some three inches long.
The eyes were large, full, round, and black with a bluish
tinge; inside of mouth at first deep orange, but later becoming
lighter ; on September 14 the feathers on nape, cheeks, ear-
coverts, sides of head and face generally, although there, were
undeveloped, and of a sandy colour ; these very slowly grew
during September. Chest, &amp;c., white edged with dark brown,
the markings lower down becoming straight bars, but less
numerous and less distinct, and towards abdomen quite faint.
The honey-comb markings on the mantle and upper back
were clear and pronounced from the first, but the white down did
not entirely disappear from the lower back for some time. Later,
viewed from behind and glancing downwards, there were the
large conspicuous globular markings of the mantle, decreasing
in size and changing to blotches and irregular lines, enlarging
again but more smudged on the lower back, and finally dis-
appearing in faint washes on the upper tail-coverts, which other-
wise were then of the same shade of brown as the tail itself.
Not less than three inner secondaries of each wing, and the
scapulars, were included in this speckled stream. To enter more

into detail. The white circular feathers of the mantle were
broadly edged with brown ; a broad irregular line of whitish ran
down the centre of the scapulars ; the inner three secondaries
of each wing had towards their tips the same character of mark-
ing, but these were irregular and not well defined, and were of a
sandy-buff colour ; on the lower back, the white centres of the
feathers were again inclined to globular, but were irregular and
somewhat mixed with the brown edgings. In the survivor the
markings on the ends of the inner secondaries were considerably
more developed, and on September 14 were conspicuous on four
feathers of each wing ; these marks fell naturally into line and
concord, when the wings were closed, with the general speckled
appearance of the upper parts, and also with the lighter shading
of the inner webs of the majority of the secondaries. In the
British Museum Catalogue it is said of the adult female that the
innermost secondaries have an " irregular white spot at the tip."
On my second female the spots are faint--the brown is a little
lighter at the tips of three or four secondaries on each side.
Perhaps if I were to handle her I might find the two white-
tipped feathers. As far as I have been able to observe without
handling the birds, these spots at first are sandy-buff, and become
darker and more brown--more of the general colour of the wing
--in the course of a year or so.
On September 14, when I took the survivor in charge for
a while, I became aware that not only a development but a
change was in progress: on this and following days several
small feathers were shed, pointing to change however limited.
Previously, the general aspect below had been grayish, with
the abdominal region whitish ; now I found a strong growth of
quite new sulphur coloured feathers bursting out on the chest
and running down the sides of the abdomen. O11 September 28
the abdomen and ventral region were still mostly white; and
there seemed to be a new and flourishing crop of white feathers
on the sides of the body , and the thighs were well covered.
The general aspect, wings excepted, of the surviving young
bird at first was whitish ; gradual^ 7 it became more gray ; rather
slowly the upper parts fell into harmony with the wings and
became brownish, the edgings of the feathers being or becoming of

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
the same shade of brown as the wings ; and the sulphur wash of
the under parts of the freshly moulted adult female, which
eventually seems to give a reddish tone to the brown, gradually
spread below entirely superseding the grays, and finalty in its
turn was absorbed by the prevailing brown hue. In the middle
of November, comparing the young bird with the second female,
the general appearance from the front was a good deal lighter,
from behind lighter and more spotted streaked and mottled. By
December, however, the brown generally had become distinctly
darker. The black and brown neck-yoke and the Owlish face-
disc, of which more anon, rather conspicuous at times towards
the end of November in the second female (moult of breeding
female not completed), were not clear oti the young bird until early
in December. It is worthy of notice that, although the second
female seemed to have completed her moult by the end of Sep-
tember, these black and brown lines did not appear until well
into November; and, although they (the connecting lines as I
may call them) are to be seen more or less plainly year after year,
in the description of the adult female in the British Museum
Catalogue they are not mentioned.
The markings on the upper part of the head deserve
attention, for probably it is here if anywhere that any distin-
guishing mark of sex (and possibly of age) may be found. Two
being the usual number of eggs to the clutch, one feels that the
young as a rule should be of different sexes.
The down was exceedingly thick and close--a regular mat
--all over the upper parts of the head. Commencing with the
forehead, it slowly rolled back from front to rear as far as the
hinder crown where it lingered for some time, finally clinging
on in the form of two fairy horns which disappeared about
September 18.
On August 31 some brown-black marks began to be clearly
seen on the sinciput of the elder bird, and on September 2 on
both of them, and on the 4th I noted as follows : Broad band
across front of head very pale buff or sandy. A dark brown,
almost blackish, irregular line across crown from behind each
eye, with two projections or horns jutting forward towards the
forehead. I11 the elder bird these horns took the form of a

on the Regent Bird.
Turkish crescent, the tips nearly but not quite
meeting where they touched the forehead band ;
in the younger (see drawing) the horns pointed
pretty nearly straight forward respectively to-
wards the two nostrils; and so, as a result, the
buff of the forehead ran upwards nearly to the
centre of the crown--in the elder in the shape
say of an orange connected by a stalk with the
forehead band, in the younger more in the shape
of a tongue. The ends of the dark cross band
jutting down on each side behind the eye nearly
severed the continuation of the forehead band
which ran back over each eye, and formed over each a large
spot of sandy.
On September 14 I found that a solid square patch of new
feathers was sprouting and replacing the down on the hinder
crown ; this developed into the crown patch of the brown Regent,
and came up to and touched the hind centre of the dark cross-
bar. The neck feathers were growing; and by the end of Sep-
tember the crown patch seemed to extend right down the back
of the neck, almost black in the front but shading in succession
into dark and light brown and gray until it merged in the mottled
white of the mantle. Then as the feathers matured the shadings
gradually dispersed, and by October 6 the lower hind-neck cross-
patch of black was observable, the black throat patch appearing
a little later.
I had great difficulty in observing the slowly changing
crown of the young bird ; on November 7 however it saw a
banshee or something and flew to me, and for about two minutes
sat absolutely rigid * on a perch almost touching me, so that as I
stooped it was directly below my eyes and scarcely a foot distant.
The sandy globe in the front had as it were expanded and pushed
back the encircling horns ; the horns were now stout and rather
rugged, the tips being over the eyes ; the base of the now ex-
panded crescent rested on the crown patch, the colour being of a
* For some time after the young&apos; birds had left the nest it was their custom to
remain immoveable in the thickest of the trees when I approached, and it was often
most difficult to find them. Sometimes at first they would draw themselves up slim and
rigid like the young Scops Owl, but this was unusual.--R. P.

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
decided black. Later, save for the two bold horns, the crown
patch became nearly as in the adult female.
The body of the deceased young bird I forwarded to Dr.
Butler, who most kindly examined the somewhat stained plumage,
and wrote :--"Owing to the shortness and small size of all the
head-feathers (with the exception of tufts of white nestling-down
at centre and back of crown) the bird has a rather vtilturine
aspect: head whity-brown with a broad blackish horse-shoe
marking, its opening in front, on the crown, a short blackish bar
runs from the back of this marking to the back of each eye, nape
covered with tiny ashy-whitish feathers; bill dull pitchy blackish
with flattish oval oche yellow patch at base of gape. Upper parts
including wings and tail deep bronze brown ; the feathers of the
mantle white broadly bordered with brown, those of the lower
back and rump broadly barred with ashy-white ; under parts
ashv-white, each feather with a narrow subterminal grey bar;
feet leaden greyish, the metatarsi pale, and washed, especially at
the back, with sulphur yellow ; digits flesh-pink at back, small
for size of bird, claws black. Total length about 7 inches."
At page 59 of the December issue I referred to three birds
of doubtful sex which had reached my hands in January, 1903.
The steamer which brought them from Australia was not a
"Greyhound," neither did it come direct, so, from the nature of
things, the youngest bird on board must have been a full year old
by the time it reached this country. Two of these three are the
heroines of my story. The other, which I will call No. 3, died
on January 10, 1904, aged two years or upwards, probably aged
two. The particulars of this bird's plumage were noted imme-
diately after death, an important point, for head markings are not
infrequently found to have been disarranged after a specimen has
passed through the hands of a taxidermist. The recorded details
are full, but I need give but a few extracts; these it will be more
helpful to give just as I noted them at the time, disregarding
curtness and other defects :--" Large round well-defined patch
occupying all front of head, about size of franc, yellow brown
with clouds of blackish ; back of crown patch of black, S x
extending forward on each side in bold horn over eye, produced
in thin black line to gape ; behind eye f- patch of black running

straight down over ear-coverts " ; " centre of throat large patch
of black joined from patch behind eye in (? by) broad curve of
dark brown forming large facial disc more and more dark as
mark approached " ; " back of neck black patch, extending round
neck, almost joining facial disc-line, but stopped by another
small patch of black." The figures of course represent fractions
of an inch.
Now on November 7 the black bar projecting down behind
each eye of my young bird was scarcely traceable, and before the
end of the month had practically disappeared. Thus at less than
four months old the young bird had lost the black protuberance
behind each eye while they were present 011 another bird of two
years old or upwards. Will my youngster, should it live, re-
assume this black bar in any form at any time? If not, here we
seem to have a mark by which the Regent may be sexed at an
early age, should the still earlier differences in the "horns" of
the two youngsters fail to prove to be a reliable guide.
Do the black and brown neck-yoke and extensions, and
the facial lines, appear on the male when in brown plumage or
are they peculiar to the female? These lines had been in
evidence on all of the three birds just referred to, and have
been so familiar to my eyes that I have accepted them as a matter
of course and without note or comment.
Was No. 3 a female ? the only part of the plumage at death
adverse to the idea is the " bold horn " over each eye, for my two
females have not these horns nor had they them this last summer ;
but I remember that during last winter and spring I had a strong
feeling that a change had come over their heads, especially that
the light coloured bands which run back over the eyes were much
broader and made a far cleaner sweep along the sides of the crown
than had hitherto been the case ; and the disappearance of the
horns in the moult of the autumn of 1904 would have accounted
for this. Probably their disappearance may be accepted as an
indication of maturity ; both of the females were willing to breed
last summer, and the second female has been most desirous to
breed this autumn. On December 2 I had a fairly good view of
her when not four feet distant, and noticed that her eyes were
remarkably yellowish, quite yellowish-brown at any rate for the
time being.

Mr. R. Philupps,
I may mention in this connection that when two males
fight--usually it is a case of the stronger attacking the weaker--
they may be found lying on their sides on the ground face to face,
each with his two feet firmly interlocked in those of his antagon-
ist. On these occasions it is easy to catch one or even both of
them. Last November I used to find the pursuing male and the
hesitating (because of the cold) female in the same position, feet
clasped in feet, but of course without the vindictive griping of
the feet and the horrible braying cry (something between those
of a stag and a hare) of the weaker bird.
The following points of difference between the young bird
and No. 3 may be pointed out. Nostrils :--For a long time those
of the young bird were covered and hidden, but now they are
moderately exposed ; No. 3 (and adults of both sexes) " linear,
pervious, exposed." hides: --Nestling, black with bluish tinge
--they are still either black or very dark ; No. 3 (and the quite
brown birds as a general rule), " dark brown." Under tail-coverts
and flanks :--Young bird, white or nearly so; No. 3, "light
brown strongly barred with dark brown." These bars are very
apparent on the adult female, and by November were moderately
clear on the young bird.
When the young bird flew close up to me on November 7,
what especially attracted my attention was the beauty of the
markings on the other feathers of face, forehead, cheeks, ear-
coverts, nape, &amp;c. Each tiny feather had the minutest speck of
dusky at the tip, and nearly each set of feathers had its own
particular lie and its own particular kind of speck, so that each
part differed from its fellows--they might have been so many
Lilliputian flower-beds, each with its own peculiar bloom. The
more closely we look into and examine the plumage of some of
these simple brown birds, the more exquisitely beautiful do we
find them to be.
January 8.--The illustration of the adult male which
appeared in the December number gives one the impression that
the Regent, when carrying a stick, holds it at one end ; the sticks
are invariably held about the centre.

By mid-December the plumage of the young bird had
become fairly settled. The last notable change that attracted my
attention--early in December--was that the lower back region
had fallen into line with the general plumage and become brown,
only a few flecks of whitish being visible on December 21. It is
now very like the second female, but may readily bedistinguished,
(1) By the two horns, which are clear and distinct, (2) By the
conspicuous light sandy-buff spot towards the tip of not less than
three of the inner secondaries of each wing. These are much
plainer than they were at first, and seem to embrace more of the
actual tip of each feather. I have no note of the existence of
any such mark on No. 3 ; at two years old then, as with the
older bird, these spots are inconspicuous and have to be looked
for. The young bird is slightly smaller than the second female,
and markedly smaller than its mother.
Baby is beautifully wild yet beautifully tame. On a mild
day, and on a windy day such as January 6, it dashes about the
place like a mad creature, it cannot hold itself in ; yet at times
it just looks at me, and will not budge an inch though I come
close up to it; and it still has a way of flying up to and
perching close to me when I enter the aviary. Its inclination
to remain immoveable at times reminds me of the male--or is this
but a relic of the Branclier habit? nevertheless the light-hearted
second female is so fond of Baby that I think it may be a
male. Its wild instincts are ever present and alert. It is always
just on the point of flying away from me, yet for its very life it
cannot see any reason why it should fly away from me--and
so it doesn't!
The largest bird in my possession, and the smallest bird
(p. 95) in my possession, has each reared a brood, at the same
time, and within a few feet of one another. If this had occurred
in a couple of cages, it would have been but ordinary. But
that such a record should have taken place in an aviary --I can
only raise my two arms and exclaim with Dominie Sampson--

Platycercus erythropephis.
This very fine Parrakeet was described by Count Salvadori
from a specimen living in the Zoological Society's Gardens when
he wrote the British Museum Catalogue of the Parrots (Vol. XX.
p. 551, 1891). He remarked how truly intermediate it was
between Pennant's Parrakeet ( P. elegans ) and the Rosella ( P .
eximius).
In my book on the Parrakeets I stated that I had little
doubt that it was a hybrid between these two species and wrote
" it appears to be quite unknown in a wild state, and it seems to
me probable that the few specimens that have been seen--all, I
believe, in captivity--have been reared on the Continent from the
two most commonly imported species."
In this journal for August, 1903, Mrs. Johnstone published
the following statement, which settled the question of this bird
Being a hybrid : " Mr. Cocksedge, in his aviaries at Bey ton, bred
two fine Red-mantled Parrakeets from a cock Pennant and a hen
Red Rosella. These nested and hatched two young ones, but they
died when a few days old. I have had frequent nests of this cross
in my aviaries. This year two, but in only one case were the
eggs fertile, but the young birds (2) were killed by a weasel about
two weeks after they left the nest."
The pair of these Parrakeets bred by Mr. Cocksedge were
exhibited by him at the Crystal Palace Show held in October,
1898, and attracted considerable attention on account of their
rarity.
Although this is undoubtedly a hybrid, it is interesting to
discover that it occasionally appears in a wild state in Australia.
A friend of mine in Sydney wrote to me last August to say that
he had secured a fine specimen of the Red-mantled Parrakeet
that was caught with two others on the Northern Rivers. The
two others had died, but this one he hoped to send home to me.
It has recently arrived and is now in my aviary--an undoubted
specimen of Salvadori's Platycercus erythropeplus.

Reliable works 011 the avifauna of a county are always very
welcome additions to the literature of the ornithology of the
country. Hampshire is one of our largest counties, and one of
the most important as regards birds, and in it British Ornithology
may be said to have started, for here it was that Gilbert White
spent his long life and wrote his classical history of Selborne, a
work that will ever be cherished by lovers of natural history.
The book before us, by Messrs. Kelsall and Munn, is the
latest addition to the long list of works dealing with the avifauna
of the English counties, and its authors have spared no pains in
making it complete in every detail and absolutely reliable. The
\0x25A0extent of their research may be gathered by the bibliography of
the works consulted which occupies three pages, while the list of
their correspondents accounts for four more. Particulars have
been collected of 294 species that have occurred in the County,
which does not include many doubtful occurrences; 85 are
resident, 42 Summer visitors, 70 Winter visitors (&apos;which includes
those which pass on the Spring and Autumn migrations, but do
not stay to breed), 36 Occasional visitors, and 61 Accidental
visitors. Many species have increased considerably under
Protection, and the authors believe that all of the small birds are
increasing, with the single exception of the Dartford Warbler.
A copy of the Wild Birds Protection Act, as applied to the
County is added ; and at the end of the book an excellent map of
the county is given.
The book contains a number of very fine illustrations, the
majority being from photographs by Mr. Smith Whiting. Four,
however, representing the Stone Curlew, Cirl Bunting, Peregrine
Falcon, and Tufted Duck, are reproductions of drawings by
Mr. G. E. Lodge, an artist of the first order, whose work cannot
be too highly praised.
In a word, it may be said that Messrs. Kelsall and Munn's
work is worthy of a very prominent position in the library of
every ornithologist who is interested in British Birds.

Province birds made by my friend and fellow ornithologist, Robert H. Ivy
of Graliamstown, a description of which I thought might be of some
interest to the readers of the Avicultural Magazine :
Top of head dusky brown, faintly cross-barred with paler ; across the

yellowish brown; upper surface chocolate brown streaked with dark
brown ; coverts, secondaries, and primaries black, broadly margined with
paler and tipped with still paler brown ; rectrices black margined with pale
brown, the outer feathers very narrowly; cheeks, throat and sides of chest
dark ashy, with the breast dusky brown merging into pale russet on the

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
AVIARIES versus CAGES.
Sir, --In reply to Mr. Wiener's advocacy of small cages as opposed to
large aviaries for birds, I must restrict myself as far as possible to his
animadversions upon the flight cages in the Zoological Gardens, and par-
ticularly upon the one set apart for Parrots. By&apos; selecting a concrete case
of this kind for consideration, and by stating clearly and concisely the
reasons for his condemnation, Mr. Wiener has made discussion of the
various points comparatively easy because he deals to a great extent with
facts and not with mere generalities and opinions.
Underlying however his disapproval of this and all large aviaries
there is the conviction that birds should be kept and exhibited in small
rather than in spacious cages in the Gardens. Before any discussion of this
question can be entered upon with profit, it is necessary to settle first of all
what aspects of ornithology a Zoological Gardens should illustrate. Neg-
lecting, as outside the present topic, the possibility of exhibiting beasts
and birds faunistically and geographically, a possibility which may perhaps
take tangible shape in the remote future, let us inquire yvliich of the two
methods now in vogue in the Gardens should be given the preference, if
preference be given to either. These methods are (i) the exhibition of
series of birds in small cages, so that their specific, generic and other
systematic characters may&apos; be easily seen and compared; and ( 2 ) the ex-

hibition of birds in large cages where one may observe their mode of life in
an environment made to imitate natural conditions as far as possible. For
myself, I think that both methods should be adopted where funds and space
permit. That a show of species has an interest all its own, every orni-
thologist will admit; and that the species should be kept in separate cages
to facilitate identification may be conceded as a dictate of common sense.
But that the birds should be given cages as large as is compatible with this
purpose is also, in my opinion, a dictate of humanity.
It is not, however, possible in all cases to exhibit a duplicate series;
and where selection between the two methods has to be made, Ido not think
it can be too strongly insisted upon that the exhibition of beasts or birds
as examples of species to help naturalists in their determination is not the
primary purpose of a Zoological Gardens. That is one of the primary
purposes of a Museum, where the object can be much more easily and
satisfactorily achieved. What a Museum cannot do, with all its taxidermic
skill, is to show beasts and birds as living things, their form and colour,
their mode of progression, their response to stimuli, their display of
emotions such as rage, fear, love, and the like; in short, their behaviour and
activities under conditions representing their natural environment as far as
the limitations of artifice permit. This can only be done in a Zoological
Gardens. It is the first thing that should be aimed at as being par excel-
lence, the province of a Zoological Gardens. Need I add that its accom-
plishment is only conceivable in large flight aviaries, and that in small
cages it is worse than useless to attempt it ?
It is the answer to the question whether the Gardens should illustrate
the specific characters or the habits of living birds that carries the verdict
in favour of large or small cages. An ideal Zoological Gardens should
illustrate both these and other phases of ornithology; but in practice this
is not possible and a choice has to be made. Mr. Wiener, I infer, would
vote for the species method; but most lovers of birds would, I am sure,
prefer the other, both on the grounds of interest to themselves and kind-
ness to their favourites.
This brings me to Mr. Wiener's statements that birds are " happier,"
longer-lived, and more interesting objects in small than in large cages. In
support of these propositions he devotes a page and a half to the consider-
ations of the merits and faults of the large Parrots' Aviary in the Gardens,
showing iuferentially that he regards it as a complete failure. Since, in my
opinion, his account is altogether too pessimistic and quite misleading, I
propose to answer his allegations in some detail. If it can be shown, as I
think it can, that this aviary is not the failure he tries to make out, we shall
be in a position to conclude that the case against large flight aviaries, at all
events so far as the Gardens is concerned, collapses. For, be it noted, Mr.
Wiener has no serious fault to find with our other large aviaries. From this
may be inferred his tacit admission that birds of different kinds, if

judiciously mixed, may be kept together with success from the point of
view of the welfare of the birds and of interest to the public.
Our collection of Parrots perhaps more nearly realises an ideal ex-
hibition than any group of birds in the Gardens. In the Parrot House
there is an unrivalled series, showing as many different species as
possible, side by side in systematic order. In the adjoining flight cages
outside the house examples of some of the more valuable Parrakeets are
paired for breeding. In the large aviary on the Canal Bank are kept
duplicates of the common species in the house, to exhibit the behaviour of
these birds in a state of partial freedom.
This aviary comes in for a good deal of adverse criticism, but practi-
cally no commendation from Mr. Wiener. In the first place it is asserted
that Parrots, as an order, are unfit for collocation in a large flight cage on
account of certain peculiarities of temperament and habit. But the brief
epitome Mr. Wiener gives of their mode of life, even if its accuracy be
admitted, applies with a few unimportant modifications to a very large
number of birds. As a matter of practical experience, the Parrots in the
Gardens have shown themselves to be exceptionally well suited for associa-
tion in a spacious enclosure. Their ' intensely jealous ' disposition, regarded
by Mr. Wiener as a vice, has proved in reality a virtue. It serves to keep
like to like and prevents rather than causes the clashing of interests and
tastes which is a sure source of bickering in all communities. Now and
again a case of bullying or mobbing occurs; but on the whole an unexpected
spirit of harmony and amicability pervades the whole establishment.
With respect to the alleged poor condition of the birds in the aviary,
I rejoice to observe that Mr. Wiener speaks in the past tense. Had he
spoken of the present time, I should have been compelled to dissent most
emphatically from his verdict. At the time when a number of duplicate
parrots from the Parrot House were first put into the aviary it contained a
good many seedy-looking specimens. To these have been added from time
to time, often at the special request of donors, birds that had been
badly kept or whose plumage needed exposure to wind and rain. The
fact that there is hardly an unfit specimen now in the aviary shows how
the life suits them and is entirely opposed to Mr. Wiener's suggestion
of the opposite conclusion. It is quite true that on a dull, damp or foggy
winter's day many of them look mopy, ruffled or sleepy. So do most birds
in the Gardens; but as soon as the sun shines out their spirits rise, their
feathers fall and they behave with every appearance of vigour and health.
The fact that there were rats in the aviary was due to a fault in its
construction. A particular blemish of this kind cannot be used as an argu-
ment against large flight cages in general. Rats will get into small cages
unless proper means are taken to exclude them. Moreover it cannot be
seriously claimed that these vermin which might be seen feeding out of
the same dishes as the birds--a sight by no means devoid of interest--did
much harm.

Mr. Wiener also makes a point of the impossibility of rearing young
birds in this aviary. I cannot admit the impossibility in view of what
happened last season. But if it be granted for the sake of argument, no
very great importance should be attached to the failure. Sulphur-crested,
Roseate and other common Cockatoos, Ring-necked and Amazon Parrots
and common Macaws, with which the aviary is principally stocked, are not
much worth breeding apart from the gratification of the sentiment under-
lying the natural and praiseworthy pride of aviculturists in the successful
rearing of the families of their pets. Young parrots make no show. They
emerge from the nests like adult birds, differing in no particular from
specimens newly introduced into the aviary. I am afraid the 'hundreds'
of young parrots of the kind above mentioned, which Mr. Wiener declares
might have been successfully reared in curtailed quarters, would not have
proved very instructive or interesting to the 'public' and 'students' and
would have been a dreadful embarrassment to the Society.
The merits of the aviary Mr. Wiener summarises in two sentences.
It is a popular exhibition, and it has proved that many tropical species are
less sensitive to cold than they were formerly supposed to be. I am not sure
that those who have kept Parrots on a large scale will be prepared to admit
the novelty of the last fact, as stated. We can, however, with justice claim
to have shown that these birds will survive a Loudon winter, with a
sequence of fogs, rain, and frost in an open cage on the clay bank of a
canal--a very different thing from a cold temperature. Therein lies the
unexpected element in their hardiness: and the triumph of the success of
the experiment.
Mr. Wiener also underestimates the value of the aviarj&apos; when he dis-
misses it las a "popular exhibition." It is much more than that. It is
a place where intelligent and receptive observers may learn in a few hours
more of the habits and psychology of Parrots than they could ever pick up
by watching the same birds in small cages in the Parrot House. A man who
looks for a meaning in things may find, for instance, an explanation of some
of the differences between a Cockatoo and a Cockatiel. He will note that
the conspicuous whiteness of the one is correlated with large size, a
leisurely flight and a noisy demeanour, all bespeaking the powerful bird
fearless of attack and heedless of concealment; while the dull but patchy
plumage of the other goes with small size, an arrow-like flight, and the
faculty of vanishing from view on alighting, attributes attesting the bird's
unmistakable fear of enemies and showing the procryptic significance of
its size and coloration. Space forbids me to dwell on the many other
points of interest to be seen in this aviary, on the Darby and Joan-like
devotion of the couples of Macaws ; on the pompous flirtations of Sulphur-
crested Cockatoos; on the pugnacity and house-building skill of the Grey-
breasted Parrakeets; on the mechanical unanimity in the wheeling flight of
a flock of Budgerigars--these and a number of similar phenomena may be

observed in this aviary of ours, and probabty no where else in the Three
Kingdoms.
It maj&apos; be admitted, for the sake of argument, that birds can be kept
alive for as long a time in a small cage as in a large one, perhaps indeed
longer, especially if the large cage contain other inmates. The same is true
of pigs in sties or sheep in folds as compared with those allowed in the
one case to root in the woods or in the other to graze on the hills. It is
also true of the imprisoned convict as compared with the man of his own
social grade living a life of partial freedom in town or country. In pro-
portion as ) r ou remove a living organism from the influences of the struggle
for existence and interfere with the incidence of natural selection, due
regard being had for hygiene, warmth and food, you increase the chances of
survival. But, at all events, in the case of man, you diminish the chances
of happiness.
Although I prefer to leave the much paraded question of the
" happiness " of birds to anthropometrists resembling the heroine in
" Middlemarch," who, when young, "believed in the generosity of wasps
and the honourable susceptibility of sparrows," yet at the same time I feel
convinced that the equivalent of human felicity in beasts and birds can only
be attained by healthy indulgence in all the activities their bodies are
capable of exercising. I cannot therefore in anyway share Mr. Wiener's
view that the inanities of human conversation and the proffer of bits of
often unpalatable food to well-fed Parrots more than compensate, or indeed
in any way compensate, for long hours of monotonous existence in
small cages and for the total deprivation of all opportunity to perform
the majority of the varied activities for which nature has fitted their
organization.
I11 conclusion I must add that Mr. Wiener's criticisms of the Parrot's
Aviary do not appear to me to be serious or levelled against grave objective
realities; and that his reservation of all praise must be attributed to want
of appreciation of the particular features in which this aviary appeals to
others.
Finally Mr. Wiener raises the question of providing extra shelters in
the Gulls' Aviary. I am very strongly of opinion that artificial shelters,
be they sheds, screens, boxes, tents--what you will --are disfigurements in
aviaries where natural conditions are aimed at, and tend to destroy what-
ever beauty or artistic merit they possess. Hence, unless a good case,
based upon practical experience or sound theory, can be made out for
the introduction of such articles of furniture, aviaries are better, because
more attractive and interesting, without them. This however is a matter of
taste--and degustibus non disputandum. In discussing Mr. Wiener's reason
we are more in the realm of fact. In support of his view that our Gulls
need shelters, he states that the Penguins in the adjoining Seal Pond creep
into crevices at nightfall. Assuming, probably correctly, that Penguins, as

an order, are as insensitive to cold as Gulls, lie infers from the behaviour of
these particular Penguins that the Gulls would behave likewise if additional
opportunities were afforded them. If the Penguins in question were Ant-
arctic birds the argument might have some weight. But I think Mr.
Wiener must have forgotten that they were newly imported in the autumn
from Cape Town, and belong to a species frequenting the coast of Cape
Colon}&apos;, where the mean annual temperature is the same as that of the
Mediterranean. This speaks for itself; but it is not all. Readers of the
Aviculiural Magazine who have not seen the aviary may conclude, T sur-
mise, from Mr. Wiener's words that it is inadequately supplied with shelter.
As a matter of fact ample protection is provided from the east and south-
east winds by a mass of rockwork rising some 25 feet high and rugged with
jutting blocks and overhanging ledges; the northern winds are intercepted
or diverted by ranges of buildings constituting the Ostrich House, the
Apes House and the Pigsties: while even the warm but boisterous gales
from the sunny south and west are broken by trees and shrubbery. Surely
that is sufficient for birds that may be seen disporting in the ponds where
the ice has been broken to let them bathe!
R. I. Pocock, Zoological Society&apos;s Gardens.
Sir,-- Those who think of the miserable way in which the majority
of the small foreign finches have been treated in the London Zoological
Society's Gardens in the past will, it is to be hoped, respond to our Editor's
call at p. 109, and rail}&apos; in defence of our poor little friends who are once
more threatened with a life not fit for a blue-bottle. Mr. Wiener would
have us believe that these little creatures, just because they are little I
suppose, prefer close confinement with unnatural surroundings to com-
parative liberty with as healthy and natural environments as may be
possible in the circumstances. .Some of us may not agree with Mr. Wiener.
For some years past there has been a growth of feeling amongst the
authorities at the Gardens that two things are needed in order to keep
creatures successfully in captivity--that they should have a snug shelter,
and also a "run" as much in conformity with each creature's habits as
circumstances will permit. Exceptions in plenty there must be, and
diversities of application, but the principle is sound--as a general working
principle it cannot be improved upon. And this is the principle upon
which the new Bird House should be arranged.
Mr. Wiener has kept many birds during many years, and as a result
condemns aviaries and favours cages. I, too, have kept many birds
during many years, and as a result condemn cages and favour aviaries.
If I had space, I should not only build many aviaries but also larger
ones. The longer I live the more I detest cages; I have come to regard
a cage as a hospital for a sick bird, as a rest-house for a new arrival, but
as a home--NO !

But Mr. Wiener is Mr. Wiener; so let us consider some of liis
objections to the aviary.
Mr. Wiener condemns the new structure at New York. In my ignor-
ance I might have supposed that a building which could be subdivided into
eighty compartments would furnish accommodation fora good many birds
and allow of an unusual amount of sorting of species. But really this is not
to the point. Admitted that this particular structure is unsuitable (which
has yet to be proved), that is no reason why all aviaries should be unsuitable;
and it is the Regent's Park temperature we have to take into account not
that of New York.
Mr. Wiener condemns the Canal Bank aviary. That it is not fault-
less is apparent even to the naked eye. But Mr. Wiener is bound to admit
that in some respects it has been a success. There are other birds in the
world beside the parrots. Few species are more interesting in a large place
to the general observer than Choughs, Jackdaws, Magpies and the like.
Why is our handsome English Jay tabooed at the Zoo. ? Jays, Pies, Cissas,
Jay-Thrushes, Laughing-Thrushes, and heaps of other species may be kept
together if the aviary be large. And the Blue Pies (Urocissa) can be seen in
their glory only in a large place ; and even small hawks may be introduced.
But of course the delicate species must be withdrawn or sheltered in cold
weather.
Members of the parrot family are exceptional, needing exceptional
treatment, and even they are so diverse that they cannot all be tarred with
the same brush. In truth they like to climb, but to climb about trees--even
dead ones--and not up the wires of a tiny prison. They do enjoy a good fly,
and to all appearances are all the better for one, yes even happier. Mr.
Wiener omits to mention that many of the creatures which were placed with-
out introduction into that aviary were old cage prisoners that had been
cribbed and confined for so long that they could not pick up strength at
short notice. I fancy that some of our antipodean members could tell us
that the soul of a Cockatoo sometimes rises above a climb. But many of the
parrots are as savage and bloodthirsty as birds of prey, and like them can-
not be thrown together anyhow with impunity.
The Canal Bank aviary is far from perfect; let its imperfections be
borne in mind when other aviaries are about to be erected. But why
condemn aviaries in principle because some are not satisfactory ? How about
the many aviaries scattered over the country which have done good work in
the past ? How about the Western Aviaries at the Zoo ? And the huge one
in which Ibises and other strange fowl have bred ? Why even Mr. Wiener
praises the new Gulls' Aviary, and refers to the Waders' and European Wild
Birds' as "indeed beautiful." The principle of the aviary is good; but of
course intelligence and common sense must be applied in its construction,
and to the nature and number of the birds to be placed in each aviary. As
Mr. Wiener himself argues, birds cannot be packed together like stuffed

specimens in a glass case. Yet the more I think over his article the more I
feel that most of his troubles he brought down upon himself by errors in
this direction.
Some of Mr. Wiener's experiences seem strange, pointing almost to
neglect. As I well know, private individuals have other things to attend to,
and cannot bestow upon their pets as much time and attention as they could
wish. But birds allowed to starve because others eat up their food! Is it
usual to dole out to each bird in an aviary its portion of food by weight or
measure as in a beseiged city--just so much and no more ? And is it abso-
lutely necessary to place all the food in one spot ? I place the food in many
parts or aviary and birdroom so that every bird may have abundance; and
if there should be a timid bird or a shy feeder, its haunts are located and
needs supplied so that it cannot help finding food. If plenty of simple food
be supplied, there will not be any overeating. Birds requiring exceptional
food and exceptional treatment should not be kept in a general aviary. Of
course there will always be a scramble for special delicacies--which as a rule
the birds are better without.
To liberate a new or a weak bird into a large aviary without mtroduction
is to court disaster. Such a bird should be placed in a suitable house inside
the aviary, or in a cage, and left for one or for many days according to cir-
cumstances, until it is familiar with its surroundings, and until it knows the
other birds and the other birds know it; and when its door is left open (no
handling, if you please) the new comer is at home, and there is neither
bullying nor starvation. Such cases as those mentioned by Mr. Wiener need
not and should not occur.
Nor yet is it necessary that mice should increase to hundreds if not
thousands. This is as bad as the Egyptian mothers who allow the flies to
eat out the eyes of their babes and cry Kismit! Mice are an abomination,
but their numbers can be kept in check; and in a specially constructed
aviary both rats and mice may be kept out altogether. As may be seen by
reference to almost any number of our Magazine, birds can be successfully
bred in aviaries in spite of rats and mice. And do mice, and even rats,
never invade cages ? At the Zoo., moreover, there is a regular staff of men,
many of them trained men, whose special duty it is to look after the birds;
very different is the case of the private individual who is often otherwise
much occupied.
Birds in cages not infrequently require extra care and food during the
moult--but not as a rule in the large aviary, which as a matter of course
should have proper shelters and quiet corners into which they can retire
not only during the moult but at any time, especially at night. My birds'
moult gives me no concern ; they get through the moult without help for
they need none.
Unless the aviary be unreasonably overstocked, especially if it be
large, trees and shrubs need not die either from dirt or mice. It is the

destruction of the leaf-buds by the birds' beaks that is the chief hindrance
to the growth of vegetation. The rain will wash the trees; and if there be
plenty of mould they will derive benefit from the workings of the mice, if
any there be, rather than otherwise. With ordinary species a tree will last a
few years, especially if it be allowed a close time in the spring; and even a
dead tree is infinitely better than no tree at all. And should the tree last
but a year--what does it matter ? it has served its purpose. I11 the aviary,
do we keep the birds for the trees or the trees for the birds !! ! And the
common Virginia creeper, when once established, will defy the birds even if
planted inside the aviary. When growing on the aviary, instead of being
kept in check by the birds, it will smother the aviary if not cut hard back
every year. Have there not been box trees and ivy in some of the Western
Aviaries for years ?
Should the aviary be not too small, and should it be sufficiently lofty
(an important point), if plenty of nesting boxes and the like be put up, not
forgetting trees and shrubs and plenty of nesting material, there will be very
little quarrelling over sites, &amp;c. And it is in the aviary not in the cage that
even the little birds breed most successfully.
Certain species, as every one knows, will destroy eggs and nestlings,
but these are for a mixed not for a breeding aviary. Who would attempt to
breed even canaries along with Jackdaws, Magpies, &amp;c. ? No bird so keen
after nestlings as the Cissa ; and Jay-Thruslies, Laughing-Thrushes, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., are not much better. And some small species are regular egg-stealers,
whether in cage or aviary. If a proper selection of species be made, in-
stead of the eggs in the aviary disappearing it is just the reverse. Many
species will not breed in a cage; if there should be eggs, they may be
dropped about, eaten, or not sat upon. Nothing so miserably unsatisfactory
as the attempt to breed foreign birds in a cage. With a few species there
may be limited success, but that is the exception not the rule. And then
there come--sooner or later, it is just a matter of time--overlaying, shell-
less eggs, egg-binding, and the ruin or death of the female. On the other
hand, the very identical birds which have never failed to eat their eggs when
in a cage, when turned into the aviary will go to nest in a proper manner
and never touch an egg again. And remember that in the aviary, if my
experience is worth anything, there is no egg-binding. I have had egg-
binding both in cage and birdroom, but never in the open natural aviary.
Mr. Wiener's model cages 30 X 15 X 24 inches, each containing one pair--
and how is he going to obtain a pair in ever}- case ?--look well upon paper,
but in practice would mean the breaking up of many of the pairs by the
death of the females, not to mention the ceaseless annoyance of others
going to nest in the winter instead of the summer. Mr. Wiener's paradise
in which separate pairs will find such cages a " world in which they can be
as happy, nay even happier, than in a big park, and in which they will pro-
ceed to nest and breed a progeny" is beautiful but visionary, and provokes

a smile when I think of the delight my tiniest birds display as I open the
window and let them rush from birdroom to garden like so many children
scampering ont of school.
Mr. Wiener would have ns believe that birds in aviaries are short-
lived. That is not my experience. His own success with birds in cages
does not seem to have been very marked ; he tells us that " small finches
have been known to live six and eight years in cages." Some of us I fancy
will regard that as a rather poor record.
There are some excellent traps and contrivances for catching birds in
an aviary without injuring them ; it is a matter of patience and intelligence.
Sick birds can usually be caught up only too easily.
If we are to bring Mr. Wiener's arguments to a logical conclusion, all
of our birds should be caught up and caged. Fancy all the birds in the
Western Aviaries being caged in pairs (?) and stacked in rows! What a
delight to the visitors! What an increase to the staff would be needed!
Birds in an aviary give wonderfully little trouble compared with the same
birds caged. The latter require incessant care and attention, and their true
nature is never seen. And as to the rarer species of which only single
specimens can be obtained, and the widowers--what is to be done with
them ?
It is curious that Mr. Wiener should have omitted to mention a very
serious drawback to a large exposed natural aviary. In a cold wet summer,
one conies across a delicate species now and then which seems to be unable
to produce a fertile egg. This may have been the fault of an individual
specimen; but one or two cases I think I have rightly attributed to the
cold. Again, I have had several species which have been perfectly success-
ful up to the time of the young leaving the nest, but, as braucliers, the
young have been quite unable to stand the cold and wet--for they keep to
the trees--and many died. With such species, aviaries built on the prin-
ciple of the Western Aviaries would be preferable.
Speaking generally, if in their future home the small foreign birds
are confined in cages, the movement will be a retrograde one unworthy of
the Society. Rather let the new House be constructed on the plan of the
Western Aviaries, but with admission for the public both to front and rear as
in some of the other houses. Let the outside flight be as natural as
possible, with grass * gravel trees and shrubs, and the inside as snug as you
like and as light as possible. Dead leafless trees (not evergreens), in pots or
otherwise, should be placed in the inner part, and, as a rule, nesting boxes
* Grass and rape seed in the spring and summer, and wheat nearly all the year
round, may be sown in the open part of the aviary with advantage. Two or three plots,
renewed in succession as required, will furnish a supply of green food during the greater
part of the year, and largely contribute towards the health and happiness of the birds.
Do not forget that it is the cage not the aviary bird that so often dies from the effects of
eating green food.--R. P.

in the warm season only. In cold weather, most little birds can be driven
back into their shelter without difficulty, many will go back of their own
accord; they readily learn their way backwards and forwards through quite
a small aperture, so that the inner part may be kept comfortable. During
open weather in the winter, most of these small foreign birds are all the
better for a fly and a little pecking about in their little garden. We do not
tether our children out on the lawn and leave them there both night and
day--but even in the coldest weather we let them out for a run. And this
driving of the birds backwards and forwards is very valuable in hindering
them from going to nest during the cold season.
Mr. Seth-Smith refers to allied forms being kept together. Allied
forms are all very well when the birds are males or non-breeders; but where
there is nesting (as a general rule) allied forms are more likely to quarrel
than are those which are dissimilar. At any rate I have found them so.
I should like to add a plea on behalf of the Birds of Prey, Diurnal
and Nocturnal, that at least some of them might be allowed a little more
liberty. Several of the smaller species may be kept safely together in a large
place. And what more beautiful than the graceful flight of these birds !
Kestrels and Hobbies I have often kept together. I never but once had a
mishap, and then curiously enough it was a faultless Sparrow-Hawk that
was attacked and killed, not the other way about. And even the Owls
delight in freedom. Mr. Wiener would have spoken differently of them
had he known them better. I have kept the four larger British Owls (Long-
ear, Short-ear, Brown, White) together without a quarrel, but not in pairs.
And there must be plenty of space, and food for all must be put out at the
same time. Scops, too, may be kept together, and will breed without
accident--but of course the place must not be too small. Many of the
Corvidce may be kept with small hawks, but not with owls.
One matter more. Should the first thought of the Zoological
authorities in keeping birds be to facilitate the identification of species, or
should they not rather seek to find out the natural life of the birds ? Surely
the latter. We do not want our dear old Zoo. to be turned into a Museum
of dry bones. Let those who desire to identify specimens and examine
feathers go to South Kensington. But at the Gardens let aviculture be
encouraged; and the more natural the surroundings are the more truth-
fully may this be done. It is careful attention in this connection at
Frankfurt (p. 25) that has produced such splendid results there. Mr.Wiener
seems to apply it all to the keeping of birds in cages. He omits to mention
that the front of the bird-house consisted " of large aviaries opening into
open-air aviaries." Moreover, gate-money is not to be flouted: an open
aviary has far greater attractions for the many-headed than has a row of
cages. To them a bird is a bird and nothing more. One from the country,
who certainly ought to have had higher ideas, told me not long ago that the
Hedge Accentor is a " Sparrow because it is a brown bird like a Sparrow."

Con espondence, Notes, etc.
I do not mean that the Society should not do its best to assist and to
instruct the public. Coloured plates, even if imperfect, affixed outside the
aviary are a great help, and excite inquiry and search in many a thoughtless
breast. But care should be taken that blunders do not occur. When one
sees Chera procne called a Paradise Whydah, an Indian Barbet referred to
South America, a Scops Owl given as Scops gui, one might imagine on the
authority of the dealer who commonly imports the species and used always
to talk of " Scops guy " (as the name), one wonders why a few of the many
who are so fond of dangling their " F.Z.S." before one's eyes do not dcr
something to justify their dignity by seeing to the prevention and correction
of avoidable errors.
A great help to seeing and identifying birds would be the opening ot
a passage for the public at the back of the aviaries, as already suggested.
And may we not look to the Zoological Society to teach us how
aviaries for the various species should be constructed ? Their exhibition
of cages sufficeth for our present need. Reginald PhieeippS.
Sir, --No doubt a very great deal that Mr. Wiener writes on this-
subject is worthy of being read, marked and learnt, but if I may be allowed
to add a few words, I should like to say that it is surely a pity if, in so noted
and important an institution as our Zoological Gardens in London, there
are not to be found large flight aviaries for the smaller foreign birds; for I
understand that it is proposed to erect before long some house or aviaries,
or a house containing aviaries, by the Society, for such birds. Mr. Wiener
seems to be of an opinion that it would be more advisable to keep the birds
in cages, rather than to give visitors to the Gardens the interest of seeing
them flying about in a freer manner, and building their nests as one would
never be able to see them do, were they in cages immediately under one's
nose.
There are many beautiful and hardy small foreign birds, which would
really do better in many ways in large flight aviaries, than in small cages.
Such birds as the more ordinarily imported Grass-finches of Australia, the
members of the Waxbill family, Singing Finches, etc: etc:
I cannot say that I have found birds to be so timid as Mr. Wiener
thinks they are, when faced by strangers who visit their aviaries; and in
the Zoological Gardens where they see daily hundreds of people, this
timidity soon disappears, and they hardly seem to notice the presence of
the visitors.
In my own aviaries, which are in the country, aud away from the
house, the birds soon seem to understand that they cannot fly beyond the
wire from within, and that the visitors cannot penetrate from without.
Many of my birds will fly down and take mealworms from the hands of
strangers, and even nesting-material, much to the evident delight of both
parties.
Of course there is a risk of individual birds becoming egg-eaters or

bullies, but 011 the other baud there is no doubt far more pleasure giveu
both to the birds and the people who watch them, in allowing them a flight
aviary large enough for them to show themselves off in a manner which a
smaller cage in some ways would hinder them from doing.
Naturally the flight aviary must not be overcrowded, and some
distinct line should be drawn with respect to numbers and species ; and
only strong healthy birds should be introduced: but there is a great
fascination in an aviary which is sufficiently large to conceal many of its
inhabitants, and to then be able to stand and watch different individuals
and species make their appearance from shelters and nesting-boxes, to feed
or to bathe.
I11 my own collection of birds, I find the general run of visitors will
often look at some single bird in a cage for one minute, but wish to pass an
hour in front of the aviaries, wondering what will next put iu an appear-
ance. Some particular note or song is heard, proceeding from a hidden
bird, and they wonder who the singer is, and when he will show himself.
Or a pert Australian Parson-finch pops his head out of a nesting-box, and
flies off to drag back a wliisp of hay six times his own length, which he
proceeds to pull into his house at the front door ' hand over hand,'as it
were. And on a fine day, what a fascination there is to watch the birds
bathing. Some tiny Waxbill leads the way, and steps into the shallow pool
of running water, and immediately that miniature 'splash-splash' attracts
the others, and down they all come one after another, until there are per-
haps twenty preening and dipping, like a merry party of bathers at Dieppe.
Diamond Finches, Parson Finches, Long-tailed and Cherry Finches, Gould-
ians and St. Helena and Orange-breasted Waxbills, and perhaps Pin-tailed
Nonpareils and Indigo-birds, and Yellow Singing Finches. Such a fine
medley of colour, and a sight which one cannot see in a mere cage.
Very rare birds should no doubt be kept separately, but even then not
in such miserable little 'Crystal Palace Cage-Bird Show' cages such as for
many years have been iu the Parrot House of the Zoological Gardens.
A pair of Australian Painted Finches, JEgintha picta, would, so
long as they are rarely imported, be too precious to trust in mixed company
where there might be Hooligans, but could they not be provided with a
really large cage, with a portion of it sufficiently private for them to be
encouraged to breed ?
Certain birds one looks upon as cage-birds perhaps, especially if they
are only single males, such as a Sliama, when perhaps one cannot procure a
wife for him ; but there is not much doubt that most birds are to be seen at
a far greater advantage in a large space than in a small cage, where they
can only hop up and down, and backwards and forwards.
Neither does cage - life always suit them best. I have been un-
fortunate with caged Nightingales. Three years running I have lost my
only caged male birds in January or February: but two years ago in
December, seeing another bird was ailing and growiug thin, I turned him

into the outdoor aviary ; he lives and thrives, the cage-birds of the house
are under the sod. Yet they all had the same food, but the caged Nightin-
gales did not have what the aviary one has; fresh air all around him
(though I hate a shut window) and plenty of exercise, and who knows what
in the way of unseen spiders ? And this Nightingale is far more graceful
in the large aviary than he was in a cage, and breaks into song on moon-
light nights in the season.
With regard to overfeeding in aviaries, surely the birds with more
exercise run less risk of obesity than do the caged birds; for it would take
one all one's time to feed cage-birds at stated periods during the day, and
if the food is always in the cage (I foresee catastrophies if it isn't!) why
should not a cage-bird overeat himself as much as an inhabitant of the
aviary? If there is plenty of good clean food in the aviary, placed not all
in one spot, but in various parts, there seems to me no reason either for
birds being starved.
If I see an injured bird, I put him into hospital; if I see a bird who
is a normal and dangerous 'bully,' I remove him. I can understand an
amateur saying 'Oh ! but I have other things to do, I am often away from
home, I could not possibly be always watching for this or that contretemps.'
Quite so ! but if it is a case of the Zoological Gardens, there is a keeper,
whose sole duty it is to see to the welfare of the birds, and to watch for
bullies and signs of starvation, etc : and--catch mice.
Insectivorous birds are usually much more vindictive and spiteful
than grauivorous birds ; or else being quicker in their movements, they can
be more effective in their attacks; but I imagine that if the flight-aviary
system be adopted in the new Bird House at the Zoological Gardens, that
the insectivorous birds would not be kept in the same aviary with the small
finches etc.
If all are kept in separate cages, it strikes me that a great deal more
space will be required, and a great deal more labour involved, and I am
certain that the general public would weary of peeping into cage after
cage, and would depart to happier hunting-grounds and feed the bears !
The Western and Eastern Aviaries always used to give me keen
delight, because one saw the birds more as they are in a wild state.
The hyaenas and lions and things small and great boxed up in cages,
walking or hopping (the kangaroos had not at one time even room to do
that!) backwards and forwards, wearied one; but how exciting and how
far more interesting if the lions and tigers could be placed in an enclosure
corresponding to their size, as a large aviary does to a Waxbill! And hah
the excitement would be that one couldn't always see them, and one would
wait with a thrill down the middle of one's back, wondering from which
nesting-box--I mean cave --some lion would issue forth with a roar to seek
his meat! Oh! thrilling!!
Well! the same idea seems to me to apply to flight aviaries.

Correspondence , Notes, ete.
Sir,--I u Mr. A. F. Wiener's interesting article in the last number of
the Magazine there are one or two points which I think require careful
consideration before they can be accepted as proved.
As a matter of fact I do not believe in the happiness of any bird so
closely confined that it is neither able to take healthful exercise in the use
of all its limbs, or to bathe whenever inclined to do so. With Parrots, many
of which spend more time in climbing than in flying and rarely bathe when
they have the opportunity the size of the cage is of far less importance, but
certainly all Passerine birds should have large cages. For this reason my
smallest cages for the permanent home of even a single bird have, for the
past seventeen years, never been smaller than 18 inches cubic measure; and
-of late years I have, in all but one pair of such cages, knocked out the
partition so as to double the size.
As Mr. Wiener rightly observes, a pair of birds kept alone in a cage
will, if properly looked after, live to the maximum age of the species and
will undoubtedly enjoy life ; but it depends much upon what species they
belong to whether they will always exhibit perfect plumage. My experience
of Estrildince generally, but more especially the typical Astrilds, is--that
they spend much of their, time in a cage iu denuding one another of
feathers. I have also observed the same habit in the Blue-winged Parrotlet
and the Madagascar Love-bird, and it is probable that there are many
others of which I have had no experience, which behave in the same
manner when not allowed the free life of a moderate-sized aviary.
When I first constructed my small flight cages it was with the hope of
proving the truth of the late Dr. Russ' opinion that most of the small
foreign birds could be bred in cages. I daresay, if one could ensure the
maintenance throughout the year of a temperature not falling below 6o*
Fahr., one might succeed ; but as my conservatory (31 feet by 15 feet)
occasionally drops in winter as low as 43* Fahr., and as I keep all my cages
at one end of this enclosure, I find that it is mere waste of time to attempt
to utilize them for breeding purposes : there are, it is true, a few species (all
common) which will generally breed in such cages but even they do equally
well, if not better, in moderate-sized aviaries.
But, even covered aviaries and bird-rooms, unless kept at a high
temperature seem little more satisfactory for breeding purposes ; in both
cases egg-binding is prevalent, and no care in providing lime in all forms
for the use of the hen birds, seems to be of much use in preventing it. On
the other hand, if birds can be kept from attempting to breed in the winter
months indoors, and in the spring can be transferred to an outdoor aviary,
they are rarely troubled with egg-binding; for this reason an aviary with
outdoor as well as indoor accommodation, the whole of which is available in
the summer months while the indoor portion alone is utilized in winter,
yields by far the best results.
Although it is true that crowding with many species of uncertain

temper and varying strength is objectionable, and by no means conducive
to success in breeding; the number of species which will breed together
certainly depends largely upon the size of the enclosure, and the choice of
associates ; as well as upon the amount of natural cover, the opportunities
offered for the different species to avoid one another, and to evade close
observation by their owner. The difficulty of seeing one's birds at all
times in a natural tangle of tree, scrub, and creeper, may indeed be a draw
back to the pleasure of keeping birds, but undoubtedly it is profitable.
However clean one may keep an indoor aviary, and however free
from smell it may be, with water always changing and therefore constantly
pure, the lack of the invigorating air of the open is certainly a serious dis-
advantage ; and only by treating one's birds like hothouse plants can one
command success indoors.
A birdroom heated by a central German stove does command success
inbreeding, as we know from the results obtained by the late Dr. Russ and
many others, but it is doubtful whether the young so produced would ever
attain to anything like the vigour of those bred in open aviaries in this
country; for, years ago, I proved that the domesticated Canary, when
regularly bred out of doors, was infinitely more vigorous than the offspring
produced in heated rooms ; the latter, if turned out, even in a moderately
cool aviary under cover, were extremely liable to pulmonary complaints,
and rarely, if ever, lived to a respectable age.
For breeding-purposes, therefore, I am convinced that nothing can
compete with the wild garden aviary, even though the latter contain a
dozen or more pairs of birds f but of course care must be taken in selecting
the associates. As for cages, they are excellent, if sufficiently large, for
showing off the beauty of single birds, or pairs, of the more aggressive
species. When I discovered their practical uselessness for breeding
purposes, I appropriated my cages to the accommodation of the larger
insectivorous birds, from Tanagers to Jays ; thus providing a charming
exhibition series for visitors, but necessitating the daily preparation of fresh
ood throughout the year (a task occupying over an hour) and entirely
putting a stop to all chance of absenting myself from home for more than a
few hours even in the holiday season.
As Mr. Wiener rightly says, the small picturesque aviary with rockery,
lakes, and streams, soft plants, and graceful foliage is a failure : to some
extent I tried it myself, and when I was convinced of the error of my waj r s
and dismantled it, breaking up rockwork and filling up my waterway, it
kept three of us busy a whole day perpetually slaughtering mice as we
proceeded. That is now perhaps twelve or fifteen years ago, but even to
the present day we have not quite got rid of the vermin, and with traps always
set outside all my indoor enclosures, we generally have to set aside one day
in autumn for a raid on these prolific pests (I think our single day's bag
this year numbered about three dozen, and we caught the little wretches

every night afterwards by twos and threes until about sixty had been
destroyed) ; rats have never troubled me because all my aviaries are pro-
tected by concrete and small-mesh wire.
Seed-hoppers are of little use to prevent waste, because a mischievous
bird will keep stirring away at the opening until he has emptied the whole
of the contents upon the floor, even though the hopper is limited to one
kind of seed; and they are no protection against mice, which sit on the
front and help themselves as easily as do the birds. My arrangement of an
open pan upon an iron standard about eighteen inches high, or the use of a
deep zinc trough with a small pan in the centre hanging high up upon a
smooth wall are by far the most satisfactory seed-receptacles known to me.
I believe Miss Alderson told me, when she saw the latter in one of my
aviaries, that she had adopted a similar design herself.
The " Canal Bank " aviary at our Zoological Gardens perhaps was a
mistake; but in one respect I found it satisfactory. Until I first saw this
aviary I had never had the pleasure of seeing a flying Macaw; and only on
rare occasions when a Cockatoo or Amazon had escaped from its cage,
perhaps three or four times only in my life, had I seen these birds in
flight, and although, as Mr. Wiener says, the Cockatoos flopped round
screaming, I was thereby impressed (as he evidently was not) with the fact
that they hilariously enjoyed the exercise and comparative liberty which
they were experiencing. In short I pitied the poor maltreated trees in that
aviary far more than I did the birds, although I wondered greatly how the
winter would affect them in so exposed an enclosure.
To sum up, my opinion is, that in our public gardens small flights
should be utilized for exhibiting species, each kind kept separate ; but, for
breeding, thickly planted open-air aviaries communicating with indoor
winter quarters, the number of species proportioned to the size of the
aviary and judgment used in their selection. A. G. Butpkr.
Sir,-- I have read Mr. Wiener's article in the current number of the
Avicultural Magazine and am, on the whole, in agreement with his views,
which my own experience in the past tends to confirm. The New York
experiment is simply grotesque and can only have been conceived by some-
one entirely unacquainted with birds. The Western Aviary at the " Zoo "
was at one time my beau ideal of what such structures should be, but ex-
perience again has shown me that it may be modified with advantage, not
only to the owner but to the birds themselves. Although names and even
pictures of the different birds are placed along the front of this aviary, it is
difficult for anyone, and for a tyro impossible, to identify the different
species.
Mr. Wiener's expressed view of keeping several species together are
in the main correct. Gregarious birds however, such as the Budgerigar,
may be kept together in any number compatible with the size of the

inclosure they inhabit, but it is decidedly unwise to introduce other species
to their company, they bully and kill the small ones, and terribly annoy
such comparatively large birds as the Cockatiel. Zebra finches too are very
gregarious and not quarrelsome amongst themselves, but on the other
hand many of the Australian finches separate into pairs at the breeding
season, and the couples live as far as possible from the others, so that
lodging together or separating different species one must be guided entirely
by the habits of the birds. On the whole I am inclined to advocate the
separate system in inclosures of suitable size, not cages, nor yet large
aviaries.
In a public institution like the Zoological Gardens the interests of
the visitors should certainly be considered in the first instance, that of the
birds next. In private aviaries the conditions may be reversed, and if a
new building for the small birds is to be constructed at the Zoo it should,
in my opinion, not be of such dimensions as to preclude the easy identifi-
cation of species by the visitors, and the idea of their breeding should be
entirely subordinated to this end. W. T. Greene.
Sir,--I do not think Mr. A. F. Wiener by any means proves his case
against large aviaries. The objections which he makes apply to badly-
managed aviaries, not to aviaries in general, If it is not always possible to
exclude mice absolutely, it is at any rate in the power of most aviarists
to prevent them mustering in " hundreds, if not in thousands " ; and rats
can generally be kept out altogether. When birds are caged up separately,
then vermin may still by chance get access to them, and then will do much
more damage; and this remark applies with much greater force to cats.
With regard to feeding, if all the food is put in one dish, there
certainly is a danger of delicate individuals and weak species not getting
their share ; but there is no need whatever to concentrate the food in this
manner. Nor would any practical aviculturist group his birds so carelessly
as to mix the dangerous with the harmless. With far less supervision than
is involved in attention to a number of separate cages, aggressive indi-
viduals can be detected in an aviary and removed from it.
As to greed}&apos; birds over-eating themselves, such an occurrence is far
more probable in a cage, where the bird has nothing to do and cannot work
off the effects of his gluttony by exercise.
In respect of breeding, it is surely quite notorious that very few
birds, even the freest breeders, can be depended upon to breed in cages;
unless they be species of ancient domestication, such as the Canary and
Collared Turtle, and even these can breed in far more vigorous condition
when flying in aviaries or rooms, in spite of fighting.
Speaking of fighting, when birds fight in the aviary, there is a con-
siderable chance of the beaten bird escaping injury, at any rate for a time
long enough to allow the combatants to be separated ; whereas in a cage, if

birds do fight--as even the two sexes of the same species will do at times--
the vanquished is exceedingly likely to be killed or hopelessly injured on
the spot.
Some plants, at all events, can quite well be grown in aviaries; but
this is so well known that I need say no more about it. I do not see why
rock-work should be used in ordinary aviaries at all; it is not a natural ad-
junct in most cases, as few of the birds commonly kept are rock-frequenters,
so that it is out of place, besides providing a refuge for vermiu. In such
places as the large Gulls' aviary at the Zoo, the case is of course different.
The greater the distinctness of the kinds of birds housed in an aviary
the better they are likely to agree, due regard being had to their respective
Strength in associating them. I should have thought that, all aviculturists
knew by this time that it is nearlj&apos;-related species, or several pairs of the same
species, which fight the worst. Of course I know there are some excep-
tions; with Budgerigars and Javas, for instance, several pairs will thrive
together : and some birds agree so very well that they insist on interbreed-
ing; but of course special arrangements can be made in these cases.
I frequent the Zoo a great deal more than Mr. Wiener does, and have
always paid particular attention to the great flight aviaries, especially the
Parrot aviary, which is my favourite; indeed, I must say that I never
appreciated Parrots properly until this was erected. Both from the
aesthetic and the scientific point of view, the opportunit}&apos; of observing
the larger Parrots on the wing is one for which everyone interested in
birds ought to be sincerely grateful; and if the new management at the
Gardens had done nothing else as yet but put up and stock this aviary, it
would deserve the highest commendation it has received. I cannot agree
with Mr. Wiener that Parrots in a wild state are sluggish birds on the wing,
only flying from necessity ; in India I found the common Ring-necked
Parrakeets most active birds, constantly on the wing in rapid flight, and
anyone can see at the Gardens how the Cockatoos enjoy the use of their
wings ; while even the Macaws, so sluggish at first, are now often to be
seen indulging in aerial exercise.
As far as attention from the public goes, the outdoor Parrots get far
more of it than those indoors, as the noise in the Parrot House has always
tended against its popularity. I have specially made a point of looking up
the inmates of this aviary on any especially vile day on which I happened
to visit the Zoo, and then visiting the Parrot House ; and I always found
just as many birds looked " humpy " qnd miserable in the indoor as in the
outdoor abode, while on fine days, even if cold, there was no comparison
between them, the enjoyment of the outdoor section being so obvious.
Moreover, the mortality outdoors, Mr. Bertling tells me, is lower than it is
in the house.
I must say, however, that I think it was a great pity the Crow tribe
were removed from this aviary, where they were seen to advantage in con-

trast and competition with the Parrots, to which they did, and could do, no
harm whatever. Parrots and Crows have to live together in the wild state,
and are far less unnatural associates for each other than Gulls and Herons,
to the grouping of which together no one seems to object.
I could say a great deal more on this point, as my experience, which
has been unusually wide, if not so long as that of some of our members, is so
very much in favour of grouping birds in large aviaries ; but this letter has
already reached inordinate length, and I merely wish to remark, in conclu-
sion, that indiscriminate grouping of birds in the projected Bird House at the
Zoo is not in contemplation ; no one would expect such a policy from those
in charge. I believe that birds which will live together will be grouped
--near allies if possible--in any case birds of approximately equal size or
strength. Of course, in such groups little or no breeding can be expected ;
but the Zoological Society has surely other things to do besides breeding
common birds which are within the reach of any amateur, while rare ones
would, of course, as heretofore, be given special facilities for propagation.
In the Calcutta Zoo there were many groups of birds in large cages
or aviaries which did remarkably well, and even breeding occasionlW
occurred, though not specially arranged for, in spite of mixtures which
would have appalled some advocates of what I may call " pigeon-hole
aviculture." But after all, when so many of our members have been so
notably successful in breeding birds in aviaries, and aviaries containing
mixed collections at that, one need not go out of England for arguments
in defence of the aviary as a home for birds. Frank Finn.
THE GENUS PHONIPARA.
Sir, --The difficulty of placing this genus in the classification of the
finches has been pointed out by Dr. Sharpe in the "Catalogue of Birds,"
Vol. XII. p. 3. Although located in the sub-family Coccothraustince Dr.
Sharpe says that it is probably a genus of Buntings. Knowing as we do
that the species of Phonipara, unlike the Grosbeaks or the Buntings,
construct cave-like nests with the entrance in front, it seems to me that this
group cannot conveniently be referred to either of these sub-families ; the
nests of Phonipara are over-arched, not bag-like after the manner of the
genus Passer) so that it cannot be happily placed among the Fringillmce.
In short, as I pointed out in " Foreign Finches in Captivity," the genus Phoni-
para, in its habits, far more nearly resembles the Ploceine than the Fringilline
finches, of which it would seem to be a New World representative. On the
other hand ; if, like the Fringillidcz, its tenth primary is a remicle (concealed
within its coverts) and not a bastard-primary (extending beyond the end of
its coverts) Phonipara cannot be referred to the Ploceidce, but should I think
form a fourth sub-family of the Fringillidce under the name of Pho?iiparmce.
A sub-family based upon the habits of its members alone would seem,

perhaps, to the student of skins to be a weak one, although unquestionably
a natural one ; but until careful dissection decides what the actual affinities
of Phonipara are, it would surely be more convenient to keep it separate,
and regard it as a link between the Fringillidce and Ploceidce, than to have
it in a sort of no man's land vacillating between the Coccothraustince and
Emberizince.
The Sub-family Estiildince is based upon the absence of a distinct
winter plumage in the males. This character is satisfactory enough for
the African species, but it is valueless when one considers that the Indian
Sporceginthus aniandava regularly assumes the female dress every winter.
I have two males, purchased some six or more years ago, which are to all
appearance hen birds now : later they will answer to the description of the
winter plumage in the 'Catalogue of Birds.'

Sir, --There is another record ? of Humming Birds having been alive
in England, which I have not yet seen noticed.
In the Library of the Zoological Society are the original drawings by
Hayes, with a manuscript title page as follows :--"Rare and Curious Birds
accurately drawn and beautifully coloured from specimens in the Menagerie
at Osterly Park," the size is folio and it is dated 1782, although some of the
drawings bear earlier dates than this, and in it are figured three species of
Humming Birds. The volume also contains a few other birds not figured
in his work of 1794. E. A. PORTER.

A correspondent sends me the following letter:--"I should be
extremely obliged for your opinion of the following question, on which I
differ with several members of the Bradford Naturalists' Society--some
of whom also have a moderate knowledge of aviculture.
They maintain that each species of wild bird that sings or builds
nests exactly copies the nest and sings the same song as its parent by
imitation and tuition.
Now I maintain that it is by heredity (or by instinct if you care to
put it in that way) and therefore that the young bird does not require any
tuition.
My own experience of birds in captivity is confined to about a dozen
specimens at time and time. But I once had a Common Linnet which I
brought up by hand from a very young bird out of the nest.
This bird had no company and no opportunity of hearing the song of
its own species (which are uncommon in this immediate neighbourhood), but
it sang exactly the same notes as the wild Linnet so far as I could tell.
Of course I am aware that birds' songs can be trained to a certain

extent. But I argue that a set of say Chaffinch's eggs, hatched and reared
by saj&apos; some other species of the Fringillides, would, when mature, sing the
characteristic song and build the characteristic nest of their own species,
providing that they had suitable (and natural) opportunities of doing so."
It seems to me that in the case of nest-building, instinct, or heredity,
alone guides the nest-builders in their task. It can hardly be supposed
that, when a bird arrives at the age at which nature dictates that it shall
proceed to accomplish the chief event of its life, it can remember the
details of the nest it was reared in, and which it left long before it was able
to fend for itself. With song, however, it is different. A bird taken from
the nest and reared by hand, which is unable to hear the song of others of
its own species, will produce an indifferent song, resembling in its principle
notes the characteristic song of its kind, but lacking the variety of detail to
be heard in the song of a truly wild bird that has had the opportunity of
learning from the songs of wild birds of its own species. The hand-
reared bird, moreover, will be quick to learn the notes of other species that
it may happen to hear, or in fact any sound that may be often repeated.
There can therefore be little doubt that the song of most birds at least is, to
a very large extent, the result of imitation, though every song-bird possesses
by inheritance a more or less inferior song of its own. D. Seth-Smith.
FLOWERS, FTC. AS FOOD FOR BIRDS.
Sir, --I find that many birds, especially Parrots and Parrakeets, are
very fond of flowers. A Sliama swallowed down three or four rose petals
when I dropped them into his cage; and my Queen Alexandra, Many-
coloured, and Redrump Parrakeets delight in nibbling at daisy and dande-
lion blossoms, and also chrysanthemums, etc.
A walk in the woods and by the hedgerows will enable one to pick a
varied menu in the shape of hips and haws and seed pods of different
kinds. I tried a King Parrot with fresh olives, and he ate them greedily,
although he ' made faces ' over the bitterness thereof.
In Italy, where one can buy cheaply plenty of pomegranates, the birds
are extremely fond of the beautiful crimson seeds, which are so juicy.
A varied diet is most necessary for nearly all birds, and one has only
to see their eagerness when a large bunch of salad and dessert is put into
their cages or aviary, to know how much they appreciate it.

Have none except the King Parrot ever been imported? A. insig-

I have extracted this list of names from Dr. Ant. Reichenow's book

Fisher of Cassel, Germany. It is a most useful work owing to the coloured

AUSTRALIAN BIRDS.
Mr. J. B. Housden sends us the following cutting from the Freemantle
Press of November 12th, 1905, and states that he hopes to have the whole of
the collection therein mentioned in his aviaries at Sydenham shortly; and
if any member of the Avicultural Society would like to see the birds Mr.
Housden would be glad to show them any afternoon after their arrival.
A FINE CORRECTION OF BIRDS.--At the Athletic Hall, attached to the Pier Hotel,
Freemantle, is to be seen one of the largest and most valuable collections of rare Australian
birds that has ever been got together. The collection represents the result of twelve
months'travels in the north of Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. The birds
are arranged in prepared cages, especially adapted for their preservation in tropical
climates Some prettily-marked doves, which grow only in certain parts of northern Aus-
tralia, and eight different varieties of finches are birds of a particularly brilliant lustre,
while a gigantic kingfisher, which is very rare, and was preserved with the greatest diffi-
culty, is a great attraction to visitors. There are also lorikeets, bronze-necked doves and
myriads of tiny birds, beautifully plumed, and the whole presents a most attractive
picture. Besides birds, there are in the collection a number of kangaroos of various
species, which are peculiar to the northern parts. There is what is called an agile kanga-
roo, a beautiful animal with a perfectly smooth skin, and specimens of the Isabel King, the
Antelopeada, the Silver King, the "Nail Tail," and the Robustus. All the kangaroos were
farmed and reared from the pouch. The director of the Perth Museum (Mr. Woodward)
visited the Hall a few days ago, and expressed great appreciation at the collection, which
will be open to the inspection of visitors.

THE COLOUR OF YOUNG PENNANT PARRAKEETS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998935069767442" page_id="32720564"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
Mr. T. N. Wilson contributes an interesting article on the breeding of
Pennant's Parrakeet, to the current number of Bird Notes, in which he
gives some valuable notes on the colouring of the five young birds on
leaving the nest. He writes: " Two of the five were olive-green on the
back and breast, with no black apparent anywhere, and crimson only on
the crown, throat and vent, with just a dash of crimson on the rump.
Their cheeks and the outer edges of their wings were blue as in the adult.
The other three were similar in colouring and marking to their parents,
except that the black feathers on the back, which in the parents are edged
with crimson, were edged with green, and the crimson on the breast, rump,
and head was duller and had a greenish hue.
" There must be some reason," continues the author, " for this
marked difference in colouring between young from the same nest, and at
present my theory, founded on a limited experience only, is that it is
sexual, and that the birds with no black feathers are hens and the others
cocks. This theory has so far been supported b}&apos; a post mortem, which un-
fortunately became necessary in the case of one of the three with black
feathers, which flew against the rafters of the aviary, and died of concussion
of the brain."
It would seem however that the three young birds which left the nest
with the red plumage characteristic of the adults were abnormally pre-
cocious, since the young of Platycercus elegans have been described by
several good observers, none of which have mentioned individuals coloured
like those above described. Gould states that ''much variation exists
between youth and maturity; during the first autumn the young birds are
clothed in a plumage of nearly uniform green ; to this succeeds a parti-
coloured livery of scarlet, blue, and green, which colouring is continually
changing until the full plumage is assumed."
Mr. A. J. Campbell mentions a nest of this species containing eight
eggs, of which the parents were both in immature dress, showing that this
species sometimes even breeds before it has assumed the red of maturity.
P. elegans appears to be subject to considerable variation as regards
the colour of its immature plumage and the time occupied between the
nestling stage and the assumption of the adult coloration. We know that
the so-called P. mastersianus is merely an abnormally-coloured variety of
P. elegans, and a discussion which took place in this Magazine some years
ago tended to show that thei&apos;e exists a race of Pennants (possibly hybrids
between P. elegans and P. adelaidensis) in which the plumage of the female,
after she had reached maturity, differed considerably from that of the male,
a difference which is not apparent in the majority of srecimens of P. elegans.
That a sexual difference does exist in the colouring of the young
birds was noticed by the Rev. C. D. Farrar when he bred the species in
1899, for he wrote " The hens only have a carmine crown on the top of their

heads, followed&apos;by sage green; backs sage green with dull black centres;
tails of hens tipped with white and green centres ; cocks' tails blue where
the hens' are green. The young hens have much more green on the necks
and sides than the young cocks." (Avie. Mag., Vol. V., p. 178).
Doubtless Mr. Wilson is correct in his theory that the three red birds
are males and the green ones females, but it does not follow that all young
male Pennants are coloured like his; it must, I think, be regarded as a
very interesting case abnormal precocity. D. S-S.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
From time to time members have recorded their successes
and failures in breeding birds in the pages of our Magazine, and
have expressed a wish that others would do the same ; and
although, in consequence of the fact that eight of my smallish
aviaries are indoors, and not kept at a high temperature, my
successes have been few and generally not remarkable, those who
are not blessed with numerous or large wild out-door aviaries
may probably be interested even in my failures.
At the beginning of the year I had two Doves sitting in
my indoor aviaries--Wells' Ground-Dove in one of the covered
aviaries looking upon my back garden, and a Barbary Dove in
one of the small aviaries behind my bird-room; both were
paired to Necklaced Doves. That with the Wells' Dove
ignored her, and I exchanged him first for a cock white
Barbary and later for a hybrid Necklace + Barbary cock, but she
has never laid one fertile egg. If I could by any means have
secured a cock Wells' Dove, I should, without question, have
had a large family of this species, inasmuch as the indefatigable
creature has laid between three and four eggs every month, sitting
by herself the full time upon all which she has not broken.
In the case of the Barbary-Necklaced hybrids, as I have
already recorded, the first four nests produced one young one
apiece ; after which two nests failed, and I replaced the Necklaced
Dove by a cock Senegal, who simply ignored the white Barbary;
nesting therefore came to an end in that aviary.
On the 25th March I purchased a pair of Wonga-Wonga

i6o Dr. A. G. Butler,
Pigeons (Leucosarcia fiicata) and turned them into my larger
garden aviary with a pair of Phaps chalcoptei&apos;a and my Indian and
English Blackbirds, which had already spent a year in the same
aviary. With the approach of mild weather the new inmates
built a nest above the portico at the entrance to the aviar}&apos;&apos;,
paired, but did not lay ; later they built a nest on the branch of
a fir in the aviary, paired frequently, but again without result.
I received an impertinent anonymous letter complaining of
the song of the cock-bird, and requesting me to wring its neck or
get my son to poison it ; incidentally I heard that all my
neighbours regarded the bird as a nuisance ; so, when month after
month passed without an egg being laid, I eventually decided to
remove the Wonga-Wougas to my bird-room. No sooner was the
removal accomplished than the hen began to lay on a platform of
branches at the back of the aviary, her eggs dropping between
the branches and smashing on the ground. I added much fresh
material, to render it impossible for eggs to fall through, but the
stupid creatures set to work and re-arranged the spot selected as
a nest, so that some eggs fell among the twigs below and were
bruised or cracked, while others again fell to the ground ; then
in November the hen suddenly deserted the nest, began to mope
in corners, and died on the morning of the 22nd ; I sent off the
cock on the 27th in exchange for other birds which I hope may
yield more satisfaction.
In my toy-aviary in the conservatory (which I hardly
regard as an aviary at all) I had--at the commencement of the
year--at one end two hen Madagascar Love-birds and a cock
Passerine Parrotlet ; from jealousy the strong Madagascar bird
killed and gnawed away half the skull of the weaker one, and
then made advances to the Blue-winged bird ; but, though
months were spent in coquetting, nothing resulted as compensa-
tion for the murder. At the opposite end I had a pair of Yellow-
billed Cardinals, both strong and healthy; they were very
friendly but showed no inclination to breed; and, about
September I think, the hen unexpectedly died in the night and I
sent her to the Natural History Museum. I fancy she must have
had a night scare and cracked her skull. In the centre division,
which measures about three feet square and is perhaps seven feet

high, I only have Zebra-finches. These have produced only
seven or eight young during the year.
In the Magazine for last August I described the successful
breeding of one hybrid between Merula boulboul and Merida
menda in my larger garden aviary, and I promised to describe the
young bird after its moult. This event has not yet taken place,
but all the juvenile streaking has disappeared from the breast,
and the bill is becoming gradually more yellow. The colouring
now, at the end of November, is golden olive brown, the upper
surface slightly darker, more rufescent in some lights, more
olivaceous in others ; the wings are also darker with the exception
of an ill-defined patch, corresponding in general form with the
grey patch of M. boulboul , but of the same golden-brown as the
under surface of the body, the centre of the throat is rather
more huffish. From the absence of dark streaking on the
throat and breast, excepting a single dusky streak at each side
of the throat, and the somewhat slender bill, I should judge
this bird to be probably a cock ; but the colouring is certainly
peculiar.*
In February I purchased four young Cordon-Bleus, turning
them into my long covered aviary ; three of these promptly died,
the fourth is still living and vigorous ; in May I bought others,
which died. On the 25th of this month I purchased some
Australian Finches and turned them out (with a pair of Diamond
Doves, and a pair of Chinese Quails received the previous
December) into my double outdoor aviary (30 feet by 9 feet).
This aviary having been planted with privet and hawthorn and
provided with thick cover in the way of a thicket of branches at
one end and smaller stacks at the opposite end, I expected to
succeed in breeding satisfactorily this year. The following is
what happened :--
The Chinese Quails never nested at all, but I believe this
was the general experience of breeders in 1905. The Diamond
Doves hatched one young one in two successive nests, and
refused to feed it in each instance after it left the nest ; each
young one therefore died on the third day after it flew. The

Rufous-tailed Grass-finches built and began to lay, when the
Pectoral-finches appropriated the nest as a squatting booth;
again they built and began to lay, and again the Pectoral-finches
did as before. The Long-tailed Grass-finches died soon after I
bought them. The Masked Finches carried about hay, but never
built ; at the end of the season I found two eggs in a basket-nest
which they probably placed there. The Pectoral Finches only
made themselves objectionable, and one pair disappeared
altogether, apparently through a hole gnawed by mice in the
back of the aviary just above a ledge. The Gouldian Finches
built in an old straw-hat, laid four eggs which proved to be clear;
laid again and hatched out two ; these young birds remained in
the nest about six weeks before they flew, and were able to feed
themselves three days later. They are still in the young plumage
as I write. A pair of Yellowish Finches in the same aviary chased
one another from time to time, but never built, and finally the
hen died without any apparent cause. No, it was not yolk of
egg, because there was none in the aviary ; Australian Grass-
finches don't eat it, and the Quails were not breeding.*
Not a very brilliant result from a year's hard work, and as
an appropriate finish to the untoward events my supposed hen
Maiden Dove (I prefer the German name for Calopelia puella f),
after a month's illness, died on December 31st ; it has never been
so strong as its mate and the cold was too much for it when the
sharp frosts outside lowered the temperature of its home to 43 0
Fahr.
My indoor and outdoor aviaries of various sizes are
practically eleven in number, though two of these out of doors,
being only separated by a door which I find it advisable to leave
open so as to afford the birds a thirty foot flight, may perhaps be
regarded as one. Taken collectively these various aviaries cover
about 900 square feet, and if they were properly constructed with
outdoor as well as indoor flights and plenty of rough cover in
the summer division, I should doubtless have been far more
successful in breeding; as it is I must be content with the

longevity of my caged insectivorous birds which have kept me
a constant prisoner for about twenty years. I dare not trust the
feeding of soft-food eaters to servants, therefore can never leave

satisfaction of owning these otherwise most charming of our
feathered friends.
NEW AVIARY IN THE DUBLIN ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS.
Mr. R. M. Barrington has most kindly sent the three
photographs, here produced, of the fine new aviary which has
just been erected in the Dublin Zoo. As will readily be seen
from these, it is built on sloping ground, on the side of a lake,
and part of the lake itself is taken in.
The aviary is about 90 feet long by 48 feet wide, enclosing
a laud area of some 370 square yards, and a water area of over
100 square yards. The framework consists of gun-barrel tubing,
the principal uprights being 2J inches in diameter, bedded in
concrete to a depth of three feet. The connections are made of
solid malleable iron of special pattern. The wire netting is of
the special interlinked type which is now generally employed at
the London Zoological Gardens, and the mesh is of f-inch
throughout. The employment of this small mesh wire netting is
for the purpose of preventing the ingress of Sparrows and rats,
and it renders the aviary suitable for either large or small birds.
At the London Zoo. very large mesh has been used for some of
the aviaries with the result that probably 50 per cent of the food
supplied is taken by Sparrows. O11 the other hand, it is easier
to see the birds if the mesh is large.
A passage has been formed right through the aviary, so
that visitors can go as it were into the middle of the aviary, and
be right amongst the birds. A foot-bridge of ten feet span, is
formed in the passage, under which the birds can go down to the
lake, and they can also fly to this, over the passage.
There are several trees and bushes in the aviary, but at
present these form the only shelter for the birds. The writer of

these notes has suggested that wooden shelters be erected, and is
told that this will be done.
It appears to the present writer that the portion of the
lake that has been enclosed, though it may seem excellent in
theory, may prove a danger to the future inmates of the aviary,
though of course it depends somewhat on the kinds of birds
which are to be kept. Every aviculturist knows that many kinds
of birds, if suddenly scared, will fly straight against the wire-work
of the side of the aviary, and, being unable to cling on for long,
promptly drop to the ground. Supposing a Quail, Partridge, or
Pigeon becomes suddenly scared on the land side of the passage
which separates this part from the lake side. The bird is very
likely to endeavour to fly straight across the lake, with the
result that, after crossing above the passage it conies in contact
with the wire netting and falls straight into the water below,
where it is very likely to be promptly drowned. The present
writer has suggested that some wide boards, floating upon the
water, should be fixed all round the enclosed portion of the
lake, so that, should a bird happen to fall into the water, it
would, at least, have a chance of scrambling upon one of these
and regaining dry land.
The aviary has not yet been stocked, and, apparently, the
kinds of birds to be kept have not, so far, been decided upon.
Probably only hardy species that can be left out the whole year
round will be attempted the first year at any rate.

We have been favoured with copies of some pamphlets,
issued by the United States Department of Agriculture, dealing
with the American Game Birds, and setting forth their value,
not only in providing sport and as articles of food, but as " allies
of agriculture because of the quantity of noxious insects and
weed seeds they destroy, while the harm they do is insignificant."
The two principal papers received deal with " The Bob-

white and other Quails" and " The Grouse and Wild Turkeys" ;
we propose to notice the former now, reserving the latter to a
future number of the Avicultural Magazine. The investigations
of the United States Biological Survey show that the seven
species of Quails found within their borders, with rare excep-
tions, are not only harmless, but are very useful to agriculture,
and that there is every reason why these birds should be care-
fully preserved, and, if possible, their numbers increased.
The well-known Virginian Colin or Bobwhite ( Colinus
virginianus ), the only quail indigenous to the Eastern States,
appears to be the most useful of all. It is a widely distributed
species, but has of recent years suffered from ruthless persecution
and even extermination in many places, and it is extremely
desirable that every effort should be made to preserve it. By
intelligent protection there is not the slightest doubt that these
useful birds may be greatly increased in numbers.
The breeding season of the Bobwhite varies with the
locality, but in each section of the birds' range is limited to a
fairly well-defined period. About Washington the coveys break
up early in May, and the chicks appear at the end of June or early
in July. As many as twenty-four eggs have been found in one
nest. Florida birds commence to breed about the first of April,
(sometimes earlier), Texas birds mainly in April and May.
" Throughout its range some of the birds breed earlier and
others later than the main body of the species, and the occur-
rence of second or even third broods may lengthen the season."
The Bobwhite has been known to breed, in some parts of its
range, every month of the year, except December.
The familiar call-note of the male, sounding like ' bob-
white,&apos; 4 bob-bob-white&apos; and interpreted by the farmer as ' more
wet&apos; or 4 no yyiore wet&apos; is not by any means the only note uttered
during the nuptial season. A cock-bird was noticed to leave his
perch where he had been calling 4 bob-white,&apos; and approach the
nest where the hen was sitting. 44 When within 50 yards of his
mate he uttered the rally note, so thrilling to the sportsman in
the fall, 4 ka-loi-kee,&apos; which the hen often answered with a single
clear whistle. Then followed a series of queer responsive 4 cater-
waulings,' more unbirdlike than those of the yellow-breasted

The America?i Bobwhite.
Chat, suggesting now the call of a cat to its kittens, now the
scolding of a caged gray squirrel, now the alarm notes of a
mother grouse blended with the strident cry of the guinea hen.
As a finale sometimes came the loud rasping noise, not unlike
the effort of a broken-voiced whip-poor-will. The favourite
calling stations were rail fences at a height from five to ten feet,
and the limbs of trees along fence rows."
As a rule the Bobwhite appears to be non-migratory,
though in some regions there is a tendency to local migration.
In Virginia and Maryland they generally leave their summer
quarters at the approach of winter and congregate near the
larger watercourses.
When pursued these birds often seek the shelter of woods,
but at night they regard the open country as the safest place to
sleep. They roost on the ground, a covey forming a solid ring
with tails in the middle and heads facing outwards.
As to the value of*this fine Quail to the agriculturist the
author of the report now under notice may be quoted.
"In summing up the relations of the Bobwhite to agriculture
it will be well to emphasize certain facts developed by our
investigation of its food habits. In the first place, careful
observations at Marshall Hall, where the acreage under cul-
tivation is large and the Bobwhite abundant, and less
extended investigations elsewhere afford no evidence that
the species does appreciable injury to crops of grain or fruit.
Further, its habit of destroying weed seeds is of much
economic importance. For instance, it is reasonable to
assume that in the States of Virginia and North Carolina,
from September i to April 30, the season when the largest
proportion of weed seed is consumed by birds, there are four
Bobwhites to each square mile of land, or 354,820 in the two
States. The crop of each bird holds half an ounce of seed
and is filled twice a day. Since at each of the two daily
meals weed seeds constitute at least half the contents of the
crop, or a quarter of an ounce, a half ounce daily is con-
sumed by each bird. On this basis the total consumption of
weed seeds by Bobwhites from September 1 to April 30 in
Virginia and North Carolina amounts to 1,341 tons. It is to

be remembered also that if it were not for foxes, hawks, and
trespassing pot hunters the birds would be more abundant
and their services correspondingly greater. Insects form
about one-third of the Bobwhite's diet from June 1 to August
31 ; and a calculation similar to the one employed above
shows that 340 tons of insects are destroyed during that
period."
In spite of the fact that the Bobwhite is a hardy and pro-
lific species there is evidence to show that its numbers are sadly
decreasing in almost every part of its range except where strict
protection has been extended to it. There are several reasons
for this, the chief being apparently "shooting out of season,
excessive shooting in season, and unrestricted shooting and
trapping for market." In most of the States however the bird is
now protected for the greater part of the year, the open season
varying from twenty-one days in Ohio to seven months in
Mississippi. " Stringent laws against trapping the Bobwhite
have been enacted, but such legislation should permit legitimate
trapping for purposes of propagation."
Very little appears to have been done in the way of en-
couraging this species to breed in captivity. Isolated cases in
which captive birds have laid and young have been hatched are
mentioned ; but there can be no doubt whatever that with in-
telligent care these Ouails could be reared very extensively in
properly constructed vermin-proof enclosures. The species is
known to be prolific and to lay eggs freely even in quite small
aviaries, and if kept in comparatively large wire enclosures in
which its natural surroundings could be imitated, the species
would undoubtedly rear its young quite successfully. There are
several methods by which insect food can be obtained and sup-
plied abundantly to the breeding birds, and without which
success can hardly be looked for. There is no reason why
twenty-five pairs of Bobwhites, kept each in a separate wire run
and treated with intelligence, should not, in one season, be
responsible for at least two hundred and fifty birds.
The report deals exhaustively with the various seeds and
insects which form the natural food of the Bobwhite, and of the
other species of Quails inhabiting the United States. D. S-S.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
The family Icteridce is separated from the true Starlings in
the British Museum Catalogue by the large family F ringillidce ,
and from the Ploceidcz by the families Fringillidce and Sturnidce,
yet there seems every reason to suppose that its natural position
should be between the Ploceidce and Stimiidce.
If one compares Dolichonyx with Hyphantornis, Ploceus,
&amp;c., one not only discovers a similar difference in the sexes, a
similar winter plumage in the male, but also the same character-
istic difference in the outline of the male and female beak when
viewed from above, that of the male swollen towards the middle
as in typical finches, that of the female oblique or regularly
graded.
Although it has-been repeatedly stated that Icteridce
possess only nine primaries in the wing, we now know that the
real difference between these birds and the more typical Star-
lings consists in the fact that the tenth primary is shorter than
its coverts and lies underneath the ninth (formerly known as the
second primary); it is not only not absent, but is very well
developed, sometimes about half an inch long: with a needle or
even the point of a penknife it can easily be discovered.
To all aviculturists the close affinity of the American to
the Old World Starlings is at once apparent from their habits in
captivity: both families consist of birds easily tamed, very in-
quisitive, having the same fidgety undecided way of trotting
round their food before selecting a morsel, the same method of
dividing it by piercing it with the point of the bill and then
opening the mandibles: in fact most of them look like typical
Starlings, behave like them, and to all intents and purposes are
Starlings.
The least Starling-like of the Icteridce are the genera
Dolichonyx , Leistes, and Agelceus , though A. thilius and its close
allies closely connect the last mentioned genus with Sturnus;
but then these birds stand at the Ploceine end of the family,
their females showing the characteristic pale eyebrow and streak-

ing of the Weaver-birds and, as in the true Weavers, are smaller
than the males.
Molothrus, though very like typical Agelceus in the finch-
like character of its beak, does not show similar characteristic
differences in the sexes; but it is probable that its parasitic
habits may in the course of time have effected this modification
from the Weaver-like type of colouring, which was doubtless
originally designed to conceal frequenters of rushes, reeds,,
cereals, and coarse grasses, as with many of the Warblers. It
may be questioned, if Subfamilies are to be based upon the
possession of a distinct winter plumage, whether Dolichonyx
should not be regarded as the type of a distinct group under the
title of Dolichonicince; but in spite of the very different colour-
ing, Leistes seems to me to run it so close in the triangular finch-
like character of its beak, the eyebrow streak of the female (and
of the male in winter), and the pale bordered black feathering of
the upper parts, that I can hardly think such a sub-division of
the Icteridce is desirable when one considers how little Dolichonyx
differs from Leistes in its nesting-habits.
The Bobolink is said to nest by preference in oat-fields
near to the water, the structure being frail, composed of dry
weed-stems and grasses, and lined with finer materials of the
same kind ; usually it is placed in a slight depression in the
ground, but sometimes it is attached to several weed-stems a
little distance from the ground. The Red-breasted Marsh-bird
forms its nest of dry grasses and fastens it to the upright stems
of an aquatic plant three or four feet above the water. The
difference in habit therefore is no greater than in the case of
some of the allied English Warblers ; and though there is a
greater difference in the eggs, we often find quite as remarkable
differences in species of the same genus, as for instance in Tiirdus
musicus and T. iliac 7 is.
So far as I can discover, the only reason for placing the
Icteridce next to the Tajiagridce was--that the Ccerebidce, Tanagridce
and Icteridce were regarded as nine-primaried Oscines, restricted
to the New World (cf. Catalogue of Birds, Vol. XI., Introduction,
p. VIII.), but Professor Ridgway has recently proposed to transfer
some of the Tanegridce to the Fringillidce, one to the Mimidce y

and others to the Mniotiltidcz. The Frhigillid&lt;z are generally
described as nine-primaried birds, although the tenth primary,
though concealed by its coverts as in the Icteridce , is always
present, and in Passer, Fringilla, and some other genera is
remarkably well-developed : in nestlings it can be seen without
searching for it.
The real distinction between the so-called nine- and ten-
primaried Oscmes is, that in the former the tenth primary is
shorter than its coverts and usually lies close to and a little below
the ninth; whereas in the latter it is longer than its coverts, and
lies more nearly on the same place with the ninth; the former
Mr. Pycraft tells us should be called a remicle, whereas the latter
is generally known as a bastard-primary.
Perhaps some of our members may question whether this
little article should appear in our Magazine, and ask what it has
to do with aviculture ; but surely it should be the aim of every
true aviculturist to know something respecting the relationships
of his pets, and in order to do this, he must take the trouble to
examine their structure as well as their colouring : we cannot
always sex our birds by colour alone. The man who is a good
all-round Ornithologist makes the best Aviculturist; I only wish
I could attain to that position.
THE QUAIL FINCH.
Two pairs of the interesting little Quail-finch ( Ortygospiza
polyzonal) were received by the Zoological Society on January
30th last, and are the first of their kind to be represented in the
collection.
In colour, these birds are dark grey above, and chocolate
brown on the lower breast and abdomen, the breast and flanks
being barred with white as shown in the illustration, which has
been made from the living birds. The bill, legs and feet are red.
According to Captain Shelley, this pretty little finch ranges
from Angola and Abyssinia, southward into Cape Colony.
Stark writes: "These pretty little birds are usually met
with in small flocks, but occasionally in single pairs, on open
grassy flats. Here they feed on the ground, under the grass, on

the fallen seeds. If disturbed they rise suddenly, with a curious
metallic chirp, fly a short distance and settle again directly on
the ground without first perching on bushes or weeds. As a
rule their flight is rapid and direct, but they sometimes rise with
their usual sharp cry and fall again on the spot from which they
rose."
In the Ibis for 1878 (p. 297) Mr. T. Ayres gives an account
of the nest of this species, as follows :--" The nest was a very
rough structure, placed on the ground amongst the grass and not
easily seen, from its being composed of dead blades of grass ; it
was lined with a few coarse feathers, and in shape was much like
the nests of some of the Sunbirds, with a projecting eave over
the entrance, but all very rough. The eggs were five in number
and pure white; length, 0.54; breadth, 0.47."
Mr. Guy Marshall, quoted by Capt. Shelley, writes from
Salisbury, in Mashonaland : " I have noticed this little bird only
during the winter months, when it may be seen in considerable
flocks in open spaces about the town. It is very tame, allowing
approach within a few feet; but even then there is difficulty in
detecting it on the ground, owing to its protective upper side
colouring and diminutive size."

Those interested in British and Foreign Cage Birds, and who wished
to see a fine collection, had little to complain of in the exhibition held at
the Crystal Palace from February 9th to the 13th. For some years past no
less than three bird shows have been held at the Palace during the year, and
sometimes these have been in successive months, with the result that each
has been decidedly poor. The recent show is the only one held during the
last twelve months, and was decidedly in advance (so far at least as the
British and Foreign sections were concerned) of any during recent years.
Space will not permit of the British and Foreign Classes, but we propose to
offer a few remarks on the most interesting exhibits.
The classes for British Birds were well filled. There were two speci-
mens of the Meadow Bunting (Emberisa cia): an example of this species
was exhibited at the British Ornithologists' Club in December 1904, which
was said to have been captured alive with another in Sussex in October
1902. The appearance of two more of the same species points to either a
remarkable visitation of a hitherto unknown British bird, or else, as
appeared to be the general opinion at the show, that these birds had
"migrated" to this country in a travelling cage. The Meadow Bunting is
indigenous to Central and Southern Europe.
There were two Lapland Buntings, a species frequently captured on
our Southern coasts in autumn and winter; two fine Shore Larks, and no
less than six Choughs; while there were quite a number of such interesting
species as Waxwings, Tree-creepers, Wrynecks, Gold-crests, and so forth.
There was one Black Redstart and one Great Grey Shrike.
In the foreign section there was much to interest the aviculturist.
The first class, that devoted to the smaller Parrakeets, contained a very
"beautiful pair of Hanging Parrots (Loriculus) exhibited by Mr. J. Dewhurst,
which I took to be L. indicus, but without some knowledge of the locality
whence they were obtained it was difficult to name them without a chance
of comparing them with other specimens. They were, very rightly,
awarded first prize.
The class for the larger Parrakeets was well supported, the first prize
being won by a fine pair of Scaly-breasted Lorikeets sent by Mr. Housden.
The second prize was awarded to two Mealy Rosellas, belonging to Miss
Peddie Waddell, evidently both of the same sex, though I could not be
certain to which sex they belonged. A nice pair of Lineolated Parrakeets

(Bolborhynchus ) was shown, as well as two fine Kings ( Aprosmictus), two
cock Crimson Wings (Ptisles erythropterus), Barnards, Bauer's, Yellow-
naped, Pennant, Barraband, and several others.
In the class for the larger Parrots, the only bird of any special interest
was a fine Banksian Cockatoo, now a well-known prize winner, which took
the first prize ; it was exhibited by Mr. C. A. Edwards.
The class for the rarer Waxbills, Grassfinches, Weavers and Manni-
kins was a very large one, and contained some very rare and interesting
specimens. The first prize was awarded to a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills,
belonging to Mr. R. W. Hawkins, which did not look in very robust health.
A fine cock Red-faced finch ( Zonogastris melba ), owned by the same ex-
hibitor, received the second ; a good pair of Blue Waxbills (Estrelda ango-
lensis), also sent by Mr. Hawkins, and a fine cock Dufresne's Waxbill
belonging to Mr. H. Young equal third, while a pair of the rare Tri-coloured
Parrot-finch (also belonging to Mr. Hawkins) received equal fourth with a
pair of the far more beautiful ordinary Parrot-finch sent by Mr. H. K.
Picard. The Yellow-rumped Munia ( 3 f. flaviprymna ) formerly so rare, has
been freely imported during the last twelve months, and the two or three
pairs sent to this show failed to secure more than the "V.H.C." card.
There was one Giant Whydali ( Cherci progne) sent by Mr. Reavers, and one
Red-collared Whydah (Mr. H. B. Smith), a cock Crimson-fincli (Mr. Pickles),
several Gouldians, Star-finches ( Bathilda ) and so forth.
The next class was for Grosbeaks, True Finches, and Buntings. The
first prize was awarded to a very fine cock Black-lieaded Siskin, exhibited
by Mrs. C. Cooper, which was very closely followed by a most beautiful pair
of Cuba Finches (Phojiipara canora ) sent by Mr. R. W. Hawkins. I am not
sure that the order of these two prizes should not have been reversed.
There were four or five specimens of the Olive Finch (P. Iepida) a
beautiful little bird, but which cannot compare for beauty with the true
P. canora. There were three specimens of the Yellow-billed Cardinal.
The class for Tanagers, .Sugar Birds and Sun Birds contained the
gems of the show. Mr. R. W. Hawkins received the first prize and one or
two specials for a specimen of the Malachite Sun Bird. This bird was in
ver} ? bad condition indeed, and should certainly, I think, have given place
to the superb example of Calliste melanonota exhibited by Mr. S. M.
Townsend. The Malachite Sunbird is a very common bird in South Africa,
and there is no reason why it should be rare on the show-bench ; whereas the
Black-backed Tanager, which had to take second place, besides being very
rare, was in absolutely perfect health and plumage. The fact of this
specimen having appeared before on the show-bench should not prevent its
true value and rarity from being appreciated. The third prize went to Mr.
Townsend's Green Tanager, and the fourth to the same exhibitor's pair of
Blue Sugar Birds. Mr. Townsend's birds were certainly shown in the most
perfect condition that it is possible to imagine.

Sti&apos;ay Notes.
The next class was intended to embrace any species not elsewhere
provided for, and contained an interesting assortment. Two birds that I
do not remember to have seen before at a Palace show were the Boat-tailed
Hangnest (Aphobus chopi) shown by Mr. W. H. Herniman (third prize), and
Mr. Townsend's Metallic Starling (Calornis metallica). The latter bird was
entirely overlooked by the Judge. The first prize was awarded to a pair of
Silver-eared Mesias shown by Mr. Hawkins, some of the original and I
believe only consignment (of six specimens) that has ever reached this
country alive. They look a little less brilliant than they did some years
ago. The second prize went to Mr. Hawkins' White - throated Ground-
Thrush, and the third to a fine Rufous-bellied Niltava exhibited by Mr. J.
Dewhurst. I understand that this is not the same specimen that one has
seen on more than one occasion at the Palace and which was figured in
this journal. It is probably the second example of this exquisite fly-
catcher to reach this country.
The last class that concerns us here was devoted to foreign Hybrids
and contained only five entries. The first prize went to the result of a
cross between a Red-rumped Parrakeet and Mealy Rosella, the second to a
Biclieno-Zebra-finch, the third to a hybrid between Barnard's and the
Yellow-naped Parrakeet, a bird which looked extremely like an ordinary
Barnard, but upon closer examination it was easy to detect the parentage of
both species, the green on the back was that of the Yellow-naped, and the
yellow on the underparts extended to the abdomen as in the latter species
instead of forming a band across the breast as in Barnard's Parrakeet. The
fourth prize went to a bird described as a cross between the St. Helena
Seed-Eater and Grey Singing finch, but it was quite evident that an Alario
Finch was one of the parents, the other may have been a St. Helena Seed-
Eater. Mr. Fillmer showed a Silverbill-Bengalese hybrid which showed
practically no relationship to the Bengalese, though the Silverbill was very
evident indeed. D. S.-S.
STRAY NOTES.
A bird, at first believed to be a hybrid between a Pheasant and a
Partridge, was recently shot near Bedford and described and figured in the
Field of January 27th last. Her Grace the Duchess of Bedford, however,
immediately recognised the illustration and description as applying to that
of the Bamboo Partridge (Barnbusicola thoracica), a species indigenous to
Southern China, which has been acclimatised at Woburn, where it has bred
for several years. I11 colouring it much resembles the Common Partridge,
but the tail is considerably longer, and it is furnished with spurs. The
species appears to have bred in the Zoological Gardens in 1S69.
An interesting experiment is being tried at the Zoological Gardens : a
pair each of Black Kites and Buzzards, from which a few of the primaries

have been removed, have been placed in the Eland's Paddock where they
are regularly fed. Even now they are able to take short flights, and it is
hoped that as their wing-featliers grow they may take longer flights and
possibly breed in some of the trees in the gardens or in the Park, returning
regularly to their accustomed feeding place. This is an excellent idea,
which we hope may be extended to other species.
It would be very delightful to have some of the hardy Australian
Doves, for instance, nesting in our London Parks, where they should do as
well as the Wood Pigeons which have become so numerous of recent years,
Bronze-wings, Wonga Wongas and Crested Pigeons, feeding with the water-
fowl, would form a very attractive sight, and we fail to see that their
acclimatization could be objected to on any score.
It is not often that Bramblings are so numerous in this country as they
have been during the past winter. In most of the Southern Counties, at
least, almost every beech wood has contained flocks of these birds, generally
associating with Chaffinches and feeding upon the fallen beech mast. The
very conspicuous white rump and the harsh call-note are unmistakable.
A very interesting exhibition, illustrating the Chinese method of
fishing with Cormorants, was recently given at the London Hippodrome.
The arena having been flooded, a Chinaman appears on a bamboo raft with
several Cormorants round whose necks a band has been tied just sufficiently
tight to prevent them swallowing a fair sized fish, but not tight enough to
in any way hurt the birds. Fishes are then liberated into the water, and the
Cormorants immediately dive, and with marvellous dexterity very quickly
capture the fish, and return to the raft, to which they are lifted by the
Chinaman with a bamboo rod. The birds then disgorge the fish into a
basket. Having captured all the fish, the bauds are removed from the
birds' necks, the fish returned to the water, and the birds allowed to
capture them again, and this time to swallow them.
The Ibis for January is one of the most interesting numbers that has
been published for a long time. A paper on Ostrich-farming in South
Africa, by the late Hon. Arthur Douglas gives a very clear insight into the
habits of these remarkable birds. The Author proves that the oft-repeated
statement that the Ostrich is a polygamous species is entirely incorrect,
and unless the birds are allowed to choose their own mates and pair off
naturally, success cannot be assured.
Captain Walton's paper on the Birds of Southern Tibet, and that by
Mr. Eagle Clarke on the Birds of the South Orkney Islands, are also of
much more than ordinary interest, and the latter is illustrated by some
extremely good photographs, obtained during the recent Scottish National
Antarctic Expedition.

Stray Notes.
our last issue, Mr. Pocock refers to " the mechanical unanimity in the
wheeling flight of a flock of Budgerigars," and a writer in the January
number of the Emu also contributes a note on this subject; he writes:--
" A sight for bird lovers is a flight of Betcherrygahs or Warbling Grass-
Parrakeets ( Melopsittacus undulatus) on the Peak Downs [Queensland]. To
attempt an estimate of the numbers in some of the flocks is useless, and
one would be accused of exaggerating, but I have seen some masses of
green and gold some chains long and over a chain wide. The speed and
concentrated movement as they sweep round in and out of the timber in
a perfect ecstasy of flight are, I thiuk, unequalled by those of any other
bird; one minute they will be almost lost to sight as they turn edge-
ways, and the next present a broad waving ribbon."
A few months ago we noticed in these columns the new cage-bird
journal Canary and Cage-bird Life, and we are pleased to note its satis-
factory progress. We are informed by Mrs. Lewer, its Editor, that the
circulation is rapidly increasing. A new feature consists of a page of in-
teresting notes on current topics connected with birds, under the heading of
"By-the-Way Notes," by Mr. Henry Scherren, a very well-known writer on
Natural History subjects; and a most useful series of articles (which we
hope may someday be reprinted in book form) by Dr. Butler on "How
to sex Cage-birds," deals with both British and foreign species and is of
particular value to aviculturists.
A discussion has recently taken place in the columns of the Field as
to whether the Kea Parrot (Nestor notabilis) really attacks sheep as it is
generally believed to do. A conference was recently held on this subject at
Wellington, and the members came to the conclusion that the case against
the Kea was noil-proven, and the opinion of the meeting was that the
charge originated from one of these birds having been seen examining
the carcase of a sheep in the inquisitive manner that is their wont. There
seems to be very little doubt however that the Kea is occasionally guilt}&apos;.
It lives high up in the mountains, and only the flocks kept in these
regions are attacked, and the Kea is such an extraordinarily shy species
that it is practically impossible to actually discover the culprit iu the act.
The beautiful work which has quite recently appeared in two volumes
on the " Birds of Tunisia," by Mr. J. I. S. Whitaker, should find a place in
the bookshelf of every ornithologist who is interested in the avifauna of
North Africa and the Mediterranean.
" As a country for Caravan-travel and nomad-life," writes the author,
" the Tunisian Regency is perhaps unrivalled, its climate throughout a
considerable portion of the year being all that could be desired, and its
safety and freedom from hostile or fanatical natives absolute, provided
the French military outposts in the South be not overstepped." It would
seem to be a most delightful country for the study of bird-life.

Mr. Hudson says that the note of Amblyrhamphus holosericens re-
sembles the long whistle of a diver; and later on he adds:--"The long
whistling note above mentioned is their only song, but it varies consider-
ably, and often sounds as mellow and sweet as the whistle of the European
Blackbird." Hudson described the songs of S. American birds rather
optimistically, so that it would not surprise me to hear that the note was
not by any means comparable with any of those uttered by our Blackbird.
I have only seen the Red-headed Troupial at bird-shows, never in
any dealer's shop, although it is occasionally advertized for sale: in
Germany it is said to be not especially rare in the market. In 1876 a pair at
the Loudon Zoological Gardens is stated to have nested in a hollow branch,
but 110 eggs were laid.
I should not think that you paid too much for the bird, but I do not
know what price is usually asked for it: in Germany in 1887 the price was
20/- to 30/- for a single specimen.
I have not found the American Starlings dirty birds like those of the
Old World; they certainly are equally fond of bathing, but are less greedy
and consequently do not make their cages so foul.
I am afraid there is no recent book treating of birds generally except-

Sir,--I believe that the idea of birds building their nests in imitation
of those iu which they were born, originated with Charles Dixon ; and that
his idea was based upon the fact that a Chaffinch introduced into New
Zealand built a nest which by chance resembled, to a certain extent, that of
a native New Zealand bird. That this was a pure accident I proved sub-
sequently by a reference to Seebohm's " History of British Birds." Vol. II. p.
102, where a very similar Chaffinch nestis described as built on the banks of
the river Derwent, where there was no native nest from which the bird could
have copied the design (cf. "British Birds with their Nests and Eggs," Vol.
II. p. 95 and " Zoologist " 1902, p. 258). I also pointed out that the Bengalee,
a descendant of the Striated Finch, produced by the Japs iu the remote
past and constantly bred in small cages for hundreds of years, so that the
young never saw the characteristic Mannikin's nest in which their ancestors
were born, if turned loose in an aviary with growing shrubs immediately
reverted to the ancestral type of globular nest with entrance-hole in front r
that the Canary, which had been bred in cages for at least 300 years, if
turned loose in the same manner immediately constructed a typical saucer-
shaped nest in a bush; tjhese two instances alone sufficing to prove con-
clusively that birds do not build by imitation, but in accordance with the
patterns impressed upon their brains and inherited through numerous,
generations from their ancestors : in other words that they build
instinctively.
Of late years there has been a tendency to dispute the right of the
lower vertebrates to the possession of reason, or even the capacity
to possess what are arrogantly imagined to be exclusively human
passions, yet intimate association with these creatures proves that many ot
them possess reasoning faculties of a very high order. I know of one case
iu which a retriever dog belonging to a friend of mine, being left on shore
by an oversight when his master was returning to his ship; sprang into the
water in pursuit of the boat ; but, finding that he was unable to overtake
it returned to land, raced along the sea-wall until far in advance of the
boat, then sprang into the water and swam obliquely forwards so that it
exactly arrived on the spot as the boat continued its course, and was lifted
on board; no man could have calculated the point to a greater nicety, and
my friend always marvelled at this intelligence, to which he admitted he
would have given no credence if he had not himself witnessed it.
But we know that instinct is in birds, as in beasts, subservient to
reason ; because a bird has the pattern of the ancestral nest in its mind,
it does not necessarily follow that it will not build upon other lines if its
common sense dictates something more suitable to its surroundings ; we
know that where rocks or buildings are wanting, a Swallow will build on the
branches of trees ; and I have seen the nests of the Swallow built under the
shelter of eaves, so that from the ground they looked almost like those of

the House-Martin, excepting that the top was entirely open. I have also
shown that in a crowded aviary, where they were liable to interference from
other birds, both Goldfinches and Grey Singing-finches built their nests in
a Hartz bird-cage, from which one bar had been removed to enable them to
enter it; thus having only one small opening to defend: whereas, had they
built in a bush, they would have been liable to disturbance from all sides.
Undoubtedly also birds are capable, in a greater or less degree,
according to their conditions of life, of experiencing and expressing the
same emotions and passions which we feel ourselves : the manner in which
such emotions primarily originated does not for a moment negative this
fact, any more than the smile with which we greet a friend (which is said to
have originated in the snarling exhibition of the canines by our ill-tempered
anthropoid ancestors) disproves our pleasure in the present far more
philanthropic generation.
Returning to the original point respecting the imitation of the parent
nest by the young, it seems never to have occurred to Mr. Dixon that the
building was completed long before the young were even hatched ; so that,
in the first place, it would have been necessary for them to discover this
important matter for themselves ; in the second place they could never
have seen more than a portion of the interior of the nest, with the outer
rim in the case of a cup-sliaped structure, and these parts only while in
their sleepy unintelligent babyhood. As we know, the young bird 110
sooner begins to take an active interest in the outside world than it springs
from the nest, and in many instances not only never glances at the exterior
of it, but never again returns to it. How then could it possibly impress
upon its memory the bare outline of the structure ? The whole notion of
imitation is preposterous, and could not for a moment be accepted as a fact
by anybody who had taken the trouble to study the habits of birds,
had watched them building, and had used the reason with which all
intelligent human beings, in common with many less highly organized
animals, are gifted. A. G. BuTi,ER.

BREEDING.
Sir,--M y collection of birds increases rapidly. I have a fine pair of
Goura or Crowned Pigeons and three Nicobar ones.
I also have received some Tanagers--the many-coloured one, the
crimson one, the Euphonia violacect, the Euphonia viridis, some fine Blue-
shouldered Tanagers, a Dacnis cayana, and some long-beaked small green
birds with bluish heads, which I have been unable to identify: they might be
hens of Dacnis cayana but have longer and slighter beaks, more like the
Ccereba cyanea, of which I at first supposed them to be hens, but am still
uncertain : the dealers call them Vert-bleu. Also a red-backed Brazilian
Starling with a long yellow beak.

I liave also six little Hanging Parrakeets ( Vernalis) and a Scaly-
breasted Lorrikeet, some Blue-bonnet Parrakeets, and a Many-colour.
My Red Eclectus has just laid an egg. I am sorry I have not a cock
to mate her with.
My Golden-crowned Conures also laid fertile eggs, but unfortunately
the hen died.
A Russian gentleman tells me that the Many-coloured Tauager has
bred successfully in his bird-room at Odessa. They built in a box, making
their nest with strips of paper, and reared several young ones which were
flying about when he left. They were fed on mashed potatoes, milk sop,
and egg, also some insects.
Can anyone through the Avicuttural Magazine tell me how the
Nicobar Pigeon ought to be kept? Whether it requires an aviary to itself,
or whether it is good natured with other inmates ?
I have a beautiful white Thrush--an albino. I had never seen one
before, though I have seen white Blackbirds, Sparrows, and Chaffinches.
My Blue Mountain Lory and my Eos riciniata are trying hard to
speak, and they manage to articulate one or two words, and are quite
comical in their efforts. .
My Plumed Doves have not yet bred, but the Ocyphaps lophotes have
done very well; also the Diamond, Afra, and Talpacoti Doves, and the

AVIARIES versus CAGES.
Sir, --It is gratifying that my letter on the size of aviaries and cages
in the January number of the Avicuttural Magazine has elicited such
numerous and very interesting replies, which prove that the subject was
well worth discussion.
That those who share my views on the subject think it unnecessary to
reiterate or to confirm what I wrote is natural, which may lead to the
perhaps wrong impression that my views are shared by few and opposed by
many in whose name eminent specialists have voiced their opinion.
With your leave I will reply, as briefly as I can, to the chief points
urged by my critics.
Mr. Pocock argues right through his letter on the assumption that I
advocate small cages. I have neither expressed nor implied any such
recommendation. I distinctly advocated roomy and light cages or
divisions of carefully considered construction as large as the available
space permitted. " Small cages" are not at all under discussion.
Some specimen cages of the size I suggested are actually now in use
u the Insect House of the Zoo, and as they are of cubic dimension equal to
what are called in every day life drawing room aviaries, they could not be
called " small cages," which must lead ordinary readers to think I had
meant collections of small birds to be housed in prisons like the ordinary

canary cages or those abominable show cages for small birds which were in
use many years ago at the Parrot House, and which I condemn altogether.
I venture to assert that it is not a successful " environment made to
imitate natural conditions as far as possible," if we house in one enclosure a
heterogenous lot of birds, which would not consort in freedom and where
some of the inmates live in terror of some others from whom they cannot
escape, unless an aviary is imagined as big as Regent's Park.
I happen to have been present and unable to help when in one aviary
a pair of Pies attacked and killed a little Dove, and on another occasion,
when in the Canal Bank Aviary, a pair of Carrion Crows combined to kill
between them a poor young newly arrived Gull. Accidents will happen
everywhere, but these instances were preventible accidents, from which a
useful lesson might be learnt.
It is in my opinion no kindness to the birds to house a number of
different species in an aviary, it does not allow the natural habits of the birds
to be studied, and it does not enable the visitor to distinguish species of a
similar size.
Mr. Pocock quotes me as having written that birds are more interest-
ing objects in small than in large cages. I must say that I never thought
nor wrote thus.
I advocated roomy cages for each species in preference to large flight
aviaries into which a heterogeneous lot of birds of different habits, tempera-
ments and requirement sare put, and I even mentioned the measurements
of suitable cages in which a pair of small birds would be very happy, viz.,
28 or 30 inches wide, 24 inches high, and 15 inches deep. If anyone having
cages will measure what the above figures mean, it will be found that I
wrote in favour of larger cages than any habitually used anywhere for
small birds.
It may be interesting to note that the cages now used in the Parrot
House are of three sizes, the smallest, 18 inches square and 28 inches* high,
the larger 24 inches square and 35 inches high, and the largest or Parrot
aviaries 36 inches wide, 54 inches deep and 68 inches wide.
Those who keep and seriously study small foreign birds would call
cages of the size I recommend aviaries, and would no more think of turning
pairs of small birds into huge crowded aviaries than they would turn out a
number of valuable horses into a big field instead of keeping them in a
loose box.
Mr. Pocock is not pleased with what I wrote about the Canal Bank
Aviary. I think time will show that the more moderate sized flight aviaries
attached to the Parrot House will prove infinitely more satisfactory and also
more interesting than the large tent-like structure on the Canal Bank.
So far the few young Parrots hatched in the large Canal Bank Aviary
have in no single case survived leaving the nest. As Mr. Pocock seems not
to care to breed Parrots and sees no great objection to rats feeding with

the Parrots, fattening and multiplying, thee remains nothing to be said
on that point.
I have bred some Parrakeets and found it exceedingly interesting, and
the young when they left their nests were not exactly like their parents.
The late Mr. Vekemans at the Antwerp Gardens, who was in his time
unequalled as regards aviculture, showed me some thirty years ago one
enclosure in which he then bred annually 800 to 1,000 Undulated Parrakeets,
which were then fetching about a pound each. That breeding aviary was
discontinued when the price of these Parrakeets fell so rapidly. He would
certainly not have employed a huge structure of unwieldly proportions.
It would assuredly be very interesting to stock a division of the flight
aviary adjoining the Parrot House with a stock of healthy imported
Undulated Parrakeets, to breed from these, eliminating every year the old
stock and reserving only the young. It has been found that these birds
bred in Europe are paler in their plumage* and in course of time complete
transformation of colour, such as has occurred in the Canary, would prob-
ably result regularly, as has already resulted not too infrequently in the
case of individuals.
If Mr. Pocock will tenant the Canal Bank Aviary in future only with
Cockatoos and Macaws, I have not a word of criticism to offer. Only the
Cockatoos, when they have destroyed every vestige of vegetation, will
attack the woodwork, and by finding out a weak spot of the wirework will
some day wreck the place. One of these birds wrecked a flight aviary of
mine in one night, and destroyed a Canary cage and its inmate, before early
morning into the bargain.
That the Macaws lived through one winter in the Canal Bank Aviary
was an interesting surprise. Whether they will live a succession of win-
ters under the same conditions remains to be seen. I for one shall be glad,
but I doubt it.
The Toucans survived one winter in the open air and seemed wonder-
fully well, but when the next moulting time came they appear not to have
had stamina enough left, and died.
Amazons are, in my opinion, as unsuited to this aviary as African
Grey Parrots would be. These two species of Parrots are clearly very
sensitive, not as regards food and climate, but as regards surrounding
influences. When once brought in contact with human beings they become
individually attached and practically change their nature. Such birds put
into the Canal Bank Aviary would feel about as happy as a Canary turned
loose in the midst of a flight of town Sparrows.
* We have bred Budgerigars somewhat extensively in an outdoor aviary and have
never found the home-bred specimens in the least degree paler than the wild Australian
birds, and we believe that this is the experience of all who have bred these birds in good-
sized outdoor aviaries, in fact many home-bred birds are, if anything, finer specimens than
those imported from Australia. The yellow variety occasionally occurs in a wild state, and
by a careful selection a race of this variety has been established in Europe.--E d.

That someone presented an Amazon Parrot with a request that it be
placed ill the Parrots' Flight Aviary proves nothing. We see lots of well-
meaning people who cover their cages of small birds at dusk in winter, and
wonder that the poor things do not survive sixteen or seventeen hours
darkness and enforced fast. They kill them by misplaced kindness.
Mr. Pocock criticises me because I am not as delighted as he is with
what he calls the mechanical unanimity in the wheeling flight of a lot of
Budgerigars. The truth is that these pretty little Undulated Parrakeets in
the Canal Bank Aviary come down singly in rapid succession to the food
table. Whilst they are busy feeding, a Cockatoo flops into their midst and
frightens the whole flock, which flies certainly with unanimity under the
same impulse of fright, following its leader as does a flock of sheep. They
would fly as far as they could, but the limits of the aviary preventing their
flying as far as they otherwise would do, the wheeling flight results, which
is in no sense " an environment similar to their natural conditions."
In a state of nature the Budgerigar or Undulated Parrakeet lives in
Australia exclusively on grass seed undisturbed by any other creature.
When grass seed fails in a period of drought, the flocks will fly immense
distances in search of a spot where thunderstorms or humidity of the soil
have produced grass seed. For this purpose nature has endowed these
beautiful little creatures with the faculty to fly straight and very rapidly,
and to subsist for weeks and months, without a drop of water, on nothing
but dry seeds. They undertake these long flights only under the impulse
of necessity. They would be perfectly happ}&apos; if left to themselves and to a
disb of diy&apos; Canary seed, with an easily imitated dry gum tree with plenty
of perpe?idicular holes.
Mr. Pocock, writing of the Sulphur-crested White Cockatoo as "a
creature, the conspicuous whiteness of whose plumage, whose leisurely
flight and noisy demeanour all bespeak the powerful bird, fearless of
attack and heedless of concealment," evidently aims at some theory of
natural evolution. I have been wondering whether there is some to me
unknown wild indigenous animal in Australia which would attack this
noisy bird of spotless white--which innocent white, by the way, comes off
when touched by a coloured cloth.
I have been reminded by this Cockatoo of some one in Europe who
also loudly asserts himself fearless of attack when nobody dreams of attack-
ing him and who frequently disturbs the meals and rest of innocent smaller
people. However that is another matter and herewith my reply to Mr.
Pocock ends. I have taken his criticisms in good part and I trust he will
read my rejoiner in the same spirit. I will reply to his Uatin quotation
with a French one :--" De la discussion jaillit la lumiere."
That tbe British Song Birds wintered in the Waders' Aviary ought to
have had some better contrived protection against, snow, sleet or very
severe frost, than the kind of hen coop into which very few song birds will
ever dive, is not open for discussion.

My next critic is Mr. Reginald Phillipps, to whose opinions as a
distinguished aviculturist of considerable experience great attention is due.
Mr. Phillipps frankly says he detests cages and favours aviaries. The
question is what sort of cages does he condemn, what sized aviaries does he
favour, which cardinal points he does not mention.
If he can afford to build a number of aviaries or has his love of birds
sufficiently under control to resist the temptation of putting more than a
very few species of harmless birds in each aviary, I may be with him. It
stands to reason that such a plan could not be carried out in a Zoological
Garden as regards a new house for small Foreign birds. Crowded aviaries
spell disappointment and death. As regards cages, I hope and think Mr.
Phillipps would be more in agreement with me if he knew the size of the
cages I recommend for separate species in pairs.
I had in my time a fairly large aviary, it was 100 feet long and covered
I should say about half as much space as the New York Bird House covers.
It was divided into between 50 and 60 divisions of various sizes, most of
them covered and warmed, a dozen open-air flights. But I did not attempt
one tenth of the programme which the New York authorities publish. I
had a most devoted attendant on my birds, a man who had been brought up
as a gamekeeper; he came into my service as a gardener and caught my
enthusiasm for birds. I should congratulate any Zoological Garden if it
had his equal for intelligence and devotion to the birds in his charge in
its service. That was more than twenty years ago. I was present at his
funeral two years ago.
Mr. Phillipps doubts my statement that some birds may overeat
whilst others starve, though kept together. I was thinking of insec-
tivorous birds, as I thought would be clear from the context of what I
wrote.
Insectivorous birds require mealworms, and such cannot of course be
supplied ad libitum. When they are given in an aviary certain birds will
get more than is good for them, others get none at all or less than their
share. I have recently watched the gradual decline and death of two
valuable birds in different compartments of a very large aviary. Their
premature end was, in my opinion, due to the simple fact that at a critical
state of their existence other birds more agile and voracious, though
smaller than they, got the best of the food supply.
Such things do not occur merely with insectivorous birds. I had a
curious experience with seed eating birds lately. I placed a Pintail Non-
pareil with a few pairs of small finches. For the Pintail Nonpareil I gave
the birds some rice in the husk, which I procured with much difficulty.
To my great surprise the other birds all took a fancy to the rice and ate it,
only to prevent the new comer from having anj&apos;. I had to remove the
Pintail Nonpareil from the cage to feed him suitably, and from that day the
other birds would not look at any more rice.

Will Mr. Phillipps state in what manner a bird which develops-
ferocious habits, and whose removal without delay becomes necessary, is to
be caught in a huge aviary, say the size of the Canal Bank or the Waders*
aviary at the Zoo. I know but two ways--a gun or a fire engine.*
The future home of small foreign birds at the Zoo. cannot be in large
or open-air aviaries. At some little distance from the spectator the birds-
could not be distinguished, and a few dozen common small birds at half-a-
crown the dozen might as well be put in as rare and unique pairs.
Mr. Phillipps refers to the splendid results in bird keeping obtained
at the Frankfurt Zoological Gardens, to which Mr. Meade-Waldo also paid
a tribute of approval in a recent number of the Avicultural Magazine; he
is quite in error in attributing these to the few open-air flight cages. I
was in these Gardens on November 28th, 1904, and then made the following
memoranda on the spot. There are 95 cages of European birds, each cage
69 centimetres wide, 55 high, and 35 deep. In one of these cages a Hoopoe
then shown to me, in magnificent condition, had been housed eight years-
The cages for foreign birds measured :--
Lower range .. 87 c. wide, 80 high, 60 deep (33* x 30!&quot; X 23&apos;)
Second , ..66 , , 40 , 39 , (25&quot; x 15&quot; x 17!&apos;)
Upper ,, ..43 " &amp;gt;, 28 " 2 5 " (i6|&apos; X 10J&quot; X 9I&apos;}
The birds in all these cages looked in the pink of perfection and better than
those in the few flight aviaries. About these separate cages and their
inmates Mr. Meade-Waldo wrote:--"The success of the Frankfurt Garden,
as regards birds, is due to the fact that the keeper of this house evidently
thoroughly understands his speciality, loves his birds, and has his heart in
his work in the welfare of his charges, and studies the individual peculiari-
ties of each species."
I am quite in agreement with Mr. Phillipps that the Zoological
Society may with advantage try to teach the public how aviaries and how
cages could be best arranged, but it is little use either side going into ex-
tremes, the one side building overgrown aviaries and then being obliged to
put inharmonious occupants into it, or the other side being controverted
when advocating as many divisions or room)&apos; separate cages as possible,
and as an unusually extensive trial of both methods has proved most useful.
To Mr. Hubert Astley's remarks I would reply that what is suitable
and practicable at the Riviera, and in some favoured portions of England,
should not be attempted in the climate and on the soil of Regent's Park.
The Nightingales he mentions have nothing to do with the argument, for
the Nightingale is a migratory bird par excellence, and its habits are so
peculiar that it really is very ill suited for life in captivity.
* An intelligent keeper can very soon capture almost any bird, even in a very large
aviary, by the simple method of a large wire cage and a piece of string, if he baits the
cage with food that the bird is particularly fond of, such as a few mealworms for insecti-
vorous birds or "monkey nuts" for Parrots. It is worse than useless to attempt to catch
birds with nets in a large aviary. --Ed.

My good friend Dr. A. G. Butler seems to agree with me on the whole.
I do not quite participate his views about the importance of temperature.
In the case of small exotic birds, I have found that if we arrange artificial
light in such a way that birds can always feed twelve hours a day, it is of
secondary importance whether the temperature sinks occasionally to 45 0
or is kept steadily at 6o* F. In nature the fluctuations are greater, but in
the tropics small birds have not to endure 18 hours night and fast as they
have to endure in winter in our latitude. I have been preaching this
very simple fact for more than twenty-five years, but some private bird
owners still kill their pets by kindness in covering up their cages, and
Zoological Gardens seem slow to realise the importance of prolonging the
short duration of small birds' feeding time in winter. Birds of the size of
Thrushes, Starlings, Parrakeets and upwards have sufficient stamina to
endure a longer fast than small birds.
Inner cages opening into open-air ones have great drawbacks. These
are briefly draughts which are most detrimental, the free play of mice, and
the natural habit of birds dodging out when they are looked for inside, or--
in to the interior when we wish to see them in the open. The most fatal
objection is that from the inside we cannot see the birds at all, because the
latter being between the spectator and the light only the outline will be
visible.
With all that Dr. Greene says I cordially agree. Breeding small birds
in a Zoo. should be a lucky and interesting occurrence, but not of prime
importance, however, it should not be rendered impossible, nor should it be
rendered quite hopeless if attempted by the birds.
Small foreign birds should, in my opinion, be seen at the Zoo. in such
cages and conditions as a genuine lover of birds can imitate at home with
advantage to the birds and benefit to the popular knowledge of birds.
Mr. Frank Finn is the last of my friends the critics, whose writing I
propose to answer. He says that it is quite possible to exclude mice and
rats from aviaries. If he will show the way to do it he will deserve very
great thanks from many people. But I think he will find that what he says
is easier said than done.
I was indeed astonished to see him write such a sentence as--"nor
would any practical aviculturist group his birds so carelessly as to mix the
dangerous with the harmless." Does he mean to classify the birds into
two clearly divided sorts of dangerous and harmless ? like a very young
authoress paints the characters in her first novel as all black or impossibly
good and white. Very many otherwise harmless birds become at some
season in the year absolutely dangerous to other birds of their own size and
strength.
It is of no little use talking of removing every unsuitable bird from
an aviary like the Canal Bank or the Parrot House. The Crows could be
caught because they are not very agile, but the larger Parrots, which climb

as well as fly, and the Budgerigars once let loose have to be left to their
fate and can defy nets.
To be quite precise, and to make myself thoroughly clear, I will
quote the following figures :
(1) The former abominable and long since condemned cages for
small finches at the Zoo. measured : Back 12 inches, front 15 inches high,
width 14 inches, depth 10 inches, cubic contents i|- foot.
Ordinary Canary cages, such as are in use everywhere, measure about

<equation confidence="0.528445" page_id="32720610"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
14 X 10 x 14 high, or about the same cubic space.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987300363636364" page_id="32720610"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
That both these are to be condemned for use at a Zoological Garden
needs no discussion, but that is no valid reason why cages should be con-
demned altogether.
What are called "drawing-room aviaries," in which often a dozen
and more birds are kept, are 30 inches wide, 16 high, and 13 deep. When
divisible into three compartments by the insertion of two wire partitions
they have a dome, and including the dome the extreme height is 30 inches.
The total cubic contents of such a cage without the dome would be 3! feet,
with the dome about 5 feet, divisible into three compartments.
The measurements of the four specimen cages, as suggested by me
and now in use in the Insect House at the Zoo., are:

species, 36 inches wide, 18 deep, 36 high. Cubic space 13! feet ;i not divisible.
Such cages as here described under Nos. I to 4 my critics have called
"small cages" for small and very small birds!
If a gentleman desires to build a larger dining-room for himself and
a more spacious day-nursery for his children, he surely does not instruct
his architect to plan a dining-room as large as a restaurant or a play-room
as large as a riding-school.
And now that the readers of the Avicultural Magazine have fairly
heard both sides, they may perhaps, if they have time and inclination to do
so, re-read the first article which started the discussion in the January
number, and weigh for themselves which view they endorse.
Aug. F. Wiener.
Sir, --The discussion in our Magazine of aviaries versus cages has
interested me very much, and as I have been asked to send a few lines on

the subject to the Magazine, with much pleasure I add my experience
to the very interesting letters already inserted.
I have had very large aviaries--90ft. long, 22ft. high, 40ft. wide--not
unlike the great flying aviary now at the Zoological Gardens, and my first
and great objection to these roomy, and undoubtedly healthy enclosures is,
the immense difficulty in excluding vermin. I consider that I fed many
hundreds of rats, mice, and weasels. Unless the ground is carefully wired
with half-inch wire netting, vermin will get in, and then the chances are
young birds never reach maturity. My aviaries were not wired; more-
over, they were constructed with 3-inch netting, and through this size
small weasels can easily creep. This was the pest of the aviary; it is as
lithe and deadly as a poisonous snake, and truly cunning. I have had a
Peach-faced Love Bird taken off her nest (the nest was in the hollow of a
tree trunk) and every young bird (four) carried off; and not a trace of
the marauder but a few soft green feathers and a small hole, close to the
root of a Rhododendron bush. A priceless Hen Ganga Cockatoo, a bird
with a fierce temper and jaws like a steel trap, was found with her throat
bitten out. The fierceness and cunning necessary for the carrying out of
auch a scheme can be conjectured, especially when the size of the murderer
was realized, for he was caught the following night returning to finish his
meal, at the body of his victim.
I do not consider rats nearly so dangerous. I had innumerable
families of rats reared in the aviary, but they dared not touch the Cocka-
toos, and contented themselves with odd eggs and young birds.
Again the difficulty of catching birds is immense. The only way
is to feed them in the house, and sit patiently hidden, with a cord attached
to the door waiting for the desired victim to enter. I need liardl}' say
unlimited time and patience are essential.
I must say I lost few birds from disease; occasionally they died
from what I always imagined was consumption, but, on the whole, they
bred successfully and freely.
O11 the other hand my experience of cages is limited. I have kept
birds in cages--principally pet birds--but those I have kept I looked upon
as domesticated--they knew my voice, came to be fed, and lost in the
fact of their tameness, much of the originality of their wa\ T s. A tame
bird as a pet is charming, but it is not aviculture.
Doubtless, from the health point of view, birds do fairly well; but,
as a rule, I found they became too fat, and consequently diseased. They
have little else to do but to eat and sleep, and this cannot be conducive to
longevity. I have at the present moment a pair of Black Capped Lories
(Lorius tori) in a small aviary, loft, by 8ft., with a flight outside; also one
in a cage, placed there from force of circumstances, not from choice.
Those in the aviary are in faultless condition, brilliant in plumage, lively
and playful, as only Lories can be, racing up and down their perches,
</bodyText>

Correspondence , Notes, etc. 189
going through the quaintest of dances and acrobatic performances and
bathing, por choice, in the pipe, on the outside aviary, which carries away
the rain water from the roof.
My caged Lory I often feel verj&apos; sorry for. He can hear the chatter
of the happy pair in the next aviary ; he whistles and calls to them, and
they whistle and call back. If he were to be introduced, he would be
instantly killed, for the cock would have no mercy, and he narrowly
escaped death when the experiment was tried. He has nothing else to
do but eat and sleep. He knows his cage by heart, and his only amuse-
ment is the mimicking of the various bird notes he hears about him.
He talks Malay fluently and a little English, and is very tame; but I
always look upon him as a highly educated Lory, and totally unlike his
beautiful wild relations in the next aviary. My experience has been, too,
that very tame birds are useless for breeding. With the tameness, comes
jealousy, and when a partner is introduced, she or he is usually shamefully
ill-treated or even murdered. No rival is brooked in the affections of
their master or mistress.
My ideal aviary I at length possess, a long house facing South, a
passage at the back, wire doors into each enclosure : small flights to each
divisipn, with half inch mesh wire netting, the ground wired with the
same, then two feet of earth planted with small shrubs or tree trunks.
The window placed near the roof, with an additional frame of wire net-
ting, to use when the weather is too cold to allow the outside flight to
be used. I11 this aviary my birds live and do well; they go out nearly
every day, summer and winter, and their habits can be conveniently
studied. I can watch the birds from inside the aviary through the wire
door, and though not tame, they do not notice the footsteps up and down
the passage. I sincerely hope to learn much that is instructive this
nesting season. M. A. Johnstone.
Sir, -- I have read with interest the correspondence on Aviaries versus
Cages in the last two numbers of our Magazine.
Personally I have had no experience with aviaries, but it may perhaps
interest some of your readers to hear a little about some forty foreign
finches I have kept for years in a wire cage--34.n1. by 15m. and iSin. in
height. A few of the birds I have had for over five years, and the most
prejudiced observer could not fail to admit that they are all in a very
healthy condition.
There are Cordon Bleus, Firefiuches, Silverbills, Orange - cheeks,
Pheasant Finches, St. Helena Waxbills, Bengalese, Bronze-wings, Spice-
birds, Grey and Green Singing-finches, one Nonpareil and one Combassou.
I have never lost a bird through egg-binding, and plenty of little eggs are
laid in the wooden box attached to the cage in which the birds build nests,
and into which, at night, eight or nine birds get to sleep. The tempera-
</bodyText>

igo Correspondence , Notes, etc.
tnre of the room is never below 52 degrees, but I keep the window open
as often as I can.
At 10.30 p.111. the birds are awakened always for a feed, and a strong
electric light laid on the top of the cage, near enough to let them derive
warmth from it. I imagine the birds mistake this for the tropical sun,
and there is often a scramble as to who will keep the coveted spot nearest.
To watch the bright-coloured birds, spreading out their wings to the utter-
most fluffing their feathers, turning their little heads back, beaks open,
and hanging so, poised on a branch of spray millett, is, in my opinion, a
sight worth seeing.
If I want them to breed I separate a pair into a smaller cage, but I
have never thought they were as happy as when all together in what I call
the entente cordiale. The husband bullies his wife, or the wife is lazy and
makes him do all the work, or else he eats the eggs,or when they are hatched
grows jealous of them and kills them, or the mother again grows sulky
and tires of sitting, or finally both parents are so taken up with each other
that they forget the family completely and they starve. I11 the large cage
there is such a delightful atmosphere of no responsibility. I rarely lose a
bird. Of course I do not count as losses the birds who die within a week
of purchase. I always think they cannot have been well when bought.
I also believe introduction from a distance most necessary before
allowing birds to come into close contact with each other.

THE BALD-HEADED STARLING.
Sarcops calvus.
By Mrs. Johnstone.
In the autumn of 1905 Mr. Good fellow, on his return from
a trip into the interior of Mindanao, the largest of the Philippine
Islands, imported from there, amongst other birds, three of these
curious Starlings. They were caught near the coast where they
are fairly numerous.
Two are an undoubted pair; the odd one is, I believe, a
hen. This bird has always suffered from an injured joint, is
caged, and treated as an invalid. The remaining two are now in
my aviary in the best of health and spirits, and the accompany-
ing drawing is most life-like.
A description is unnecessary. The drawing depicts the
bird in a very characteristic position,--the ruff raised. This
same ruff can and generally does lie flat against the neck.
Colour of the bare part of the head a pale flesh pink, the
eye a chestnut brown, and the Starling would be fully coloured
and as he is in life.
The only difference I can discern between the cock and
hen is that the hen has a smaller finer head, but she is on the
whole the finer bird.
That I am correct in my surmise I have no doubt, as the
pair of Black-winged Grackle, which share their aviary, attacked
the supposed cock with great vigour, plucked out his tail and so
illtreated him that I was obliged to cage him to save his life,
while the supposed hen was absolutely ignored.
Their note is very rarely heard and it is difficult to des-
cribe, but like all the Starlings it is somewhat unmelodious.

Breeding Notes for 1905.
I feed them on an ordinary insectivorous mixture, soaked
water biscuit squeezed very dry, with a few sultana raisins. They
are exceedingly fond of the latter dainty, also oranges, which
they will absolutely finish with the exception of the peel. They
love mealworms; but seemed rather afraid of some cockroaches
I introduced into the aviarjq killing them with sharp pecks,
given as they dart down and back from an upper perch (much as
I have seen my Grackles kill a mouse) but they never attempted
to eat them.
If I could give them an aviary to themselves they might
possibly nest, and they could certainly be studied with far greater
advantage, but they could not be trusted with smaller birds.
I believe they could be wintered easily in a cold aviary ; they
appear very hardy, and have been out many days this winter,
they bathe constantly, and are always vigorous, tight and sleek
in feather.
(This remarkable Starling is confined to the Philippine and Sulu
Islands, and we believe Mrs. Johnstone's birds to be the first living
examples ever imported. Ed.]

By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The first event of interest amongst my birds was in the
third week in April when a pair of Temminck's Tragopans took
possession of a Pigeon's nest fixed up for them in a spruce tree
in which the hen laid one egg. For some unexplained cause,
perhaps the very unseasonable weather, she laid no more, and
never incubated. Presently she went seriously amiss, and I
nearly lost her, but she quite recovered in the end. Another
pair laid three eggs 011 another artificial nest, also up in a tree ;
but these eggs too were unfertile. My old pair of Demoiselle
Cranes hatched two young, and all seemed going on well. But
a very cold, dry, spell cut short the supply of insects, before the
young would take any artificial food ; and at once the parents
favoured the stronger of the two youngsters, and neglected the
other completely. It was strange to see the old Cranes, naturally
so devoted to their young, applying the law of the -'survival of

the fittest" in its most severe form. I think, in the case of the
Cranes, nothing can artificially be done in such cases, before the
young begin to pick up from the ground, which, in the case of
my Demoiselles, I have found to be about the 12th day.
Of Saudgrouse, both " Hxustus " and "Alchatus" laid
eggs, the former rearing a fine young cock bird. Chinese Quail
reared several young in two small broods. My old pair of Snowy
Owls, which were brought from Norway by a friend in July
1S91, reared a young female, since presented to the Zoological
Gardens. Curiously, this is the only young one that we have
reared at Scampston that has been tame. Others, as soon as they
could feed themselves, became wild as newly - caught birds,
though the parents themselves are quite gentle and fearless. A
Red Grouse, unluckily without a mate of her own species, nested.
I removed her eggs, and substituted some of a pheasant almost
due to hatch. The Grouse reared the chicks in the most exem-
plary manner, as she had done in 1904, without losing one. A
Capercaillie made a nice nest in what seemed a well-concealed
place, but unluckily the Rooks discovered it, and destroyed the
eggs, before the bird had commenced to sit.
My Ravens reared four young in their aviary : but after
they left the nest three of the young became affected with fits,
and in the end one only was reared. This year, 1906, the
Ravens began to carry sticks on the 1st February, and after
building a huge nest are now (March 13th) sitting close.
Perhaps amongst my birds the Brush Turkeys excite the
most general interest, and their very remarkable proceedings are
.always closely watched.
The spring was so backward that I did not supply any
fresh materials until the middle of April, but by that time the
cock had accumulated a huge heap, largely composed of soil, and
with little or no fermenting vegetable matter within it. I there-
fore removed it, and was surprised to find that there were 88
wheelbarrow loads of rubbish. A new mound was quickly
raised, a supply of lawn mowings, coarse weeds from hedge
banks, &amp;c., and a proportion of dead leaves, being ' tipped' just
inside the gate of the enclosure, some twelve yards from the site
selected for the mound. In the end two chicks emerged, and

were each found in the next enclosure but one , having somehow,
passed over, under, or through two fences of wire netting. One
of them was discovered by the sound of dry leaves being scraped
about under some dense bushes ; and each of course was quite
independent of any assistance, and was, as we say in Yorkshire,
" fending for hissen." I am sorry to say that neither was success-
fully reared, one never fed very readily, and the other succumbed
to severe cramp, brought on by exposure to a slight frost. We
satisfied ourselves that both these chicks issued from the mound
at the top. Possibly the frequent excavation of holes on hot
days, which are refilled towards night by the cock bird, has for
one of its objects the keeping of the surface of the heap in a
loose condition to assist the young one in its struggles to reach
the outer world.
The aviculturist is fortunate if he is also a bit of a philoso-
pher, for he will have to make the best of many disappointments
if he is inclined to keep, or still more tries to breed, difficult
subjects.
The saddest event of 1905 I still have to record. My old
pair of Waxwings (A. garrulus&apos;) which had hatched young in
1903, and were looking in the best of health last spring, went to
nest. The female laid a double-yolked egg, then kept changing
her nest (as before I had several old Missel Thrushes nests fixed
up in the aviary, which the Waxwings lined to their taste) and
finally was seized with a paralysis which rapidly increased and
ended fatally. Sad to say the cock was found sitting on the
ground by his mate's body, and the following day he died also.
I was from home, and unfortunately no special examination was
made, but I have little doubt that it was a case of shock, not
unusual where birds have been mated together, as in this case,
for several years.
THE LATE CANON TRISTRAM.
By the death of Canon Tristram, D.D., F.R.S., which took place a
Durham on March 8th, the Avicultural Society has lost one of its most
distinguished Honorary Members. He was a great traveller, a great
Naturalist, and a great Churchman, and one of the founders of the British
Ornithologists' Union.

Lophoictinia isura.
By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A., F.L.S.
One day in June 1903 I went to Castang's in Leadenhall
Market in search of novelties, and there in a small cage I saw
for the first time the subject of this article. His plumage was
not good and he looked sleepy, however so rare a bird was not to
be missed, and in due course of time he became an inmate of my
aviaries.
I may as well sum him up once for all as the tamest and
most sluggish of the Raptores that I have ever met, and I
suspect that much of his tameness is due to the fact that it is too
much trouble to move. When excited or alarmed, which is rare,
he raises his crest, as shown in the accompanying photo., but
otherwise the feathers all lie flat, and no sign of a crest is
visible. In general shape and build he is much like a Swallow,
with extremely long wings, large tail and short legs, and it is
to be supposed that in correlation with this build he must spend
the greater part of his time on the wing.
The subject of this paper, when first received, was evidently
a bird in its first year, having presumably been born in November
1902. The general colour of its plumage was rufous, each feather
being broadly marked or streaked, especially on the upper parts,
with dark brown. I11 the following October it started to moult,
but, owing probably to the advent of winter, the moult was
unduly protracted and not fully completed until the end of the
following May. The new plumage was similar to the last, but
darker on the back, lighter on the head and redder on the under-
parts, while, after the next moult, which was accomplished
between May and July last year, it assumed the fully adult
plumage, as figured in Gould's Birds of Australia.
In the adult, the general colour of the upperparts,
primaries, and tail is dark brown, the latter showing three or
four faint bars; the rump and upper tail coverts lighter, trans-
versely barred with brown. The head is greyish, each feather
having a dark centre, but over the crown and neck the greyish
portions of the feathers become rufous. The whole of the under-

parts are of a deep rufous chestnut. The sexes are said to be
indistinguishable except in size, the female being slightly the
larger.
It is apparently widely, if somewhat sparsely, distributed
throughout the whole of Australia, except the extreme north,,
and lives chiefly in thickly wooded districts, where it may be
seen soaring for hours at a stretch. The only reference I could
find with regard to its food was that it consisted chiefly of birds,,
though whether it takes them alive (an exceedingly improbable
supposition, considering the shortness and comparative feeble-
ness of its feet) or finds sufficient carrion, I am unable to sa)^.
The nest is a large structure of sticks and twigs, placed on
the topmost branches of a lofty tree, and lined with leaves and
bark. The eggs are two in number, and resemble those of most
Kites, being white, irregularly blotched and splashed with red-
dish. The breeding season commences in October.
This, I am afraid combines, in a nut-shell, all that is known
of this somewhat scarce and obscure species. The peculiar build
which has gained for it a generic title of itself is probably cor-
related with a mode of life different from that of the true Kites,
but on this point information is lacking, and I can only hope
that, having pointed out this deficiency, some of our Australian
friends may send us a further communication dealing with its
habits and food in a wild state.
A SOCIABLE CYGNET.
There is a large piece of artificial water in the place where
we have lately come to live, in the North of Ireland, inhabited
solely at that time by Water-Hens and Coots, and it was with
much pleasure that we received the present of a pair of Cygnets
to share possession and adorn the lake. We hoped too that they
would to some extent keep down the mass of American weed
with which it is infested. The birds were very shy at first and
hid themselves among the reeds, &amp;c. at the furthest side of the
water and quite out of sight for some days ; by degrees however
they became tamed and soon took the bread and other food

offered to them out of our bauds eagerly and greedily and
would come close up to the bank whenever they caught sight of
11s at any time of the day, or heard our voices. They appeared
happy and contented with their lot for three or four months,
when suddenly, one morning, the lesser of the two rose up from
the water and winged its way over the tops of the trees to the
Sea which is within easy distance of this place. It was seen or
reported to have been seen from time to time for a few weeks
but, though efforts were made to re-capture the truant, they were
unsuccessful and he probably joined company with the flocks of
Wild Swans which frequent this coast and winter in Strangford
Tough.
Both these Cj^gnets were quite young when they came to
us, without a single white feather in their plumage and remark-
ably strong and well grown ; they came from the South of
England. After the desertion of his companion the remaining
bird became restless and discontented, and contrary to his usual
habits, was continually on land, following his owner about the
grounds, coming up to the stable yard some little distance from
the water, and to the front of the house; waiting for him in the
drive and even mounting the rather steep six or seven stone steps
up to the hall door and coining into the hall itself. If no one
appeared the Swan would take up a position on the grass, after
descending the steps with care and labour, and wait below the
study window uttering its curious hoarse note till it attracted
attention. It was a strange sight to watch this big bird, with its
awkward ungainly movements when on land, struggling valiantly
to keep up with its master along the gravel walks and apparently
quite happy while close to him ! though once or twice it was
found alone in the village nearly a mile from the lake and also
in the kitchen garden contemplating the men at work. Later in
the year when an accident confined his master to the house it
gave up these excursions and returned to the water where it
lives and sails about majestically and contentedly, always coming
up on land to be fed and greet its friends. It is on fairly good
terms with a pair of Canadian Geese, White Call-Ducks and
others, but showing symptons of an overbearing and tyrannical
spirit as witnessed lately in its treatment of a young Cygnet

bought to keep it company, which it at once pounced on and
kept under water, so maltreating the poor little thing that it
died a day or two afterwards.

STRAY NOTES.
With the arrival of the month of April the most interesting and
delightful time of the year, alike for the Aviculturist and the lover of
nature in general, may be said to commence. Those who have outdoor
aviaries which have been left uninhabited during the winter months should
lose no time in getting them in order for the breeding season. It is as well
however not to be in too great a hurry to transfer delicate birds from the
shelter and warmth of a sitting room to the outdoor aviary. One warm day
does not make a summer, and however genial the first part of April may
happen to be, snow and f.iost may be experienced at the latter end, or even
in May, and cutting winds can be relied upon to give 11s a fair share of
their attention. A word of warning may therefore not be out of place.
In December 1904 a Sub-Committee of the British Ornithologists'
Club was appointed for the purpose of collecting and collating evidence
regarding the immigration of our common migratory birds. .Schedules
were drawn up, printed and circulated to the keepers of light-houses and
light-ships round the south and east coasts, and to a very large number of
competent observers throughout the country. During the spring of last
year these schedules were filled in and sent up to head-quarters weekly, and
the result has been eminently satisfactory, over 15,000 records being
received. The Committee's Report has now been published as a special
volume of the Bulletin of the B. O. C., and will be of the greatest value to
those who are interested in the fascinating and difficult subject of bird
migration. A map of England and Wales is given for each of the thirty
species scheduled, and by reference to these the dates and places of arrival
of the species, aud their subsequent movement through the country may
be seen at a glance. The Report is published at six shillings, and may be
obtained from Messrs. Witlierby and Co., 326, High Holborn, or Mr. R. H.
Porter, 7, Princes Street, Cavendish Square.
As we have said, the result of the investigation into the Spring
Migration is eminently satisfactory so far as it goes, but it is not wise to
draw conclusions from the records of one season only; these records in-
crease in value as they are compared with those of subsequent years, and

we are extremely glad to be able to state that the observations will be
continued through the season that is now upon us, and we hope for a
number of years.
There are probably many of our members living in the country who
are interested in the subject of Bird Migration, and who would like to help
the Migration Committee by filling up and sending in, week by week, the
schedules recording the arrival of Summer Birds. As the migration season
has commenced there is no time to lose, and any member who knows his
birds is invited to write at once for schedules to the Secretary of the Migra-
tion Committee, Mr. J. L. Bonliote, c/o The Zoological Society, 3, Hanover
Square, London, W.
The fourth and last of the Bird Volumes of the Fauna of South Africa
b} r Mr. W. L. Sclater, (Loudon : R. H. Porter), has now been published,
and a most useful and beautiful work completed. In this volume 281
species of Game-, Shore-, and Water-birds are described, making up a total
of 814 species for South Africa. The illustrations, of which we are enabled
CEna capensis.
to reproduce one here, are numerous and excellent, having been drawn
(with the exception of five photographs by Mr. H. E. Harris) specially for
this work by Mr. Gronvold.
The illustration above reproduced, of the charming Harlequin, Cape,
or Namaqua Dove is of especial interest to Aviculturists as it is a species
not infrequently kept by them. It inhabits practically the whole of Africa

and crosses the Red Sea into Arabia, so that the name of " Cape" Dove, by
which it is generally known in this country, is hardly appropriate. We
cannot call to mind any published record of the breeding in captivity of
CEna capensis.
The fifth volume of the Birds of Africa, by Captain Shelley is now
published and deals with the Orioles, Starlings and Crows. The plates,
especially those illustrating some of the magnificent Glossy-Starlings, are
very fine indeed.

Sir,-- It is almost unnecessary to add further to the one-sided
controversy of what seems to be Wiener et Greene versus the Aviculturists
of the world, but the new aviaries of the London Zoological Gardens having
been so ably&apos;defended, it is only fair to give a hearing to the ''someone
entirely unacquainted with birds" who is chiefly responsible for the
"grotesque New York experiment." With the quoting of this flattering
sentiment we may dismiss the criticism of Mr. W. T. Greene, as he advances
no original theories, bnt shows only 7 a remarkable aptitude to jump at con-
clusions,--a characteristic deplorable in a bird student, and certainly absent
in a serious ornithologist. He falls into line with Mr. Wiener as his only 7
follower up to the present date.
The defence of large aviaries in general is so excellently and
thoroughly 7 set forth by Messrs. Pliillipps, Astley, Butler, and Finn, that-
were I to undertake a general discussion on the subject, much would be
repetition. I will therefore avoid uselessly 7 occupying valuable space by
taking as my thesis the success of the new Bird House in the New York
Zoological Park.
The first birds were placed in this house in April 1905, although it
was not thrown open to the public until July. So that now, the Ides of
March see almost the completion of the first y 7 ear of occupancy 7 . During
the planning and construction prophetic " Wieners and Greenes " were much
in evidence. Doleful warnings of failure were sounded, ever and anon ;
such breaking away from the tenet of bird-caging presaging naught to
them but evil omens.
Even the most sanguine hopes of the designers have been exceeded,
as can be attested by the thousands of people who day 7 after day 7 throng the
building ; and better still by 7 the condition of the birds themselves, and by
the unprecedented low death rate.
Mr. Wiener speaks truer than he knows when he abuses the New

York climate. The fluctuations are beyond all belief, and theoretically, all
alien birds should promptly succumb to its severity. At present tliere are
not far from nine hundred healthy, happy birds sheltered by the "grotesque
experiment,"--from a flock of tiny Grassquits to great Concave-casqued
Hornbills, and all have positively refused to be influenced by Mr. Wiener's
logic. The storms of winter have howled outside and found the building
invincible, guarded night and day by the automatic thermostats, regulating
the temperature to a degree; the heat of summer has beat down and only
encouraged the birds to greater activity and song. This latter objection
was considered long before the building was completed, and it was never
the expectation that the roof should remain as it was throughout the
summer. When the direction and force of the rays of the summer sun was
gauged, a thin skim of white was laid on over certain panes of the glass
roof, thus allowing the tenants of each cage to enjoy sunshine or subdued
shadow as they preferred. Even this painting of the roof will not be neces-
sary when the plants have had several j'ears to grow; for, Mr. Wiener not-
withstanding, the flora of the Bird House is a decided success. As he
predicted, the mice wrought havoc at first, but we pitted brains of the
genus Homo against those of the genus Mas, and unexpected os the result
must be to Mr. Wiener ,--Homo has won !
The mice gnawed the roots of the palms, so we protected them with
wire; they made nests in the heart of the frond stems, so we bound a
mouse's-reach of the trunk with impassable smooth metal. The vermin
destroyed the vines until the boxes were isolated on brackets and the bricks
were varnished smooth. Defeated here, they held on for a time in the
cages themselves, until a now systematic relay of traps, terrier dogs and
Sparrow Hawks have reduced their numbers to a mere remnant of what
they once were. The fox terriers were long since introduced to all the
birds, and create hardly a ripple of excitement when lifted into a cage and
told to " dig'em out." The tropical Sparrow Hawks learned at once that
there was good hunting by moonlight, and when moved to a vacant cage
next to a flock of Weavers, they feasted high on the mice running through
the cage. Of late their supply has dwindled almost to nothing. All holes
leading to the cellar were stopped up and--thus ended the mouse war !
Among the plants now flourishing in the building are sago palms,
illawarra and areca palms, cinnamon, lemon and orange trees (the latter in
full blossom), Norfolk Island pine, creeping fig, shingle plant and other
vines. Cabbage palms stretch wide their feather) 7 fronds, and the wide-
spreading bamboo stalks have flourished ;fo that they now touch the roof.
Frequent judicious and scientific spraying has completely overcome the
dust objection ; so instead of a few " hanging baskets and hardy evergreen
bushes," which must be replaced "once a w 7 eek or every fortnight," we have
foliage growing so rapidly and well that it has been necessary to cut away
more than one leafy branch to clear the front of a cage.

Mr. Wiener criticises my figures as to the total number of species of
Parrots. Sharpe's "Hand-list of Birds," Vol. II., gives about 575. If 425
additional species have been named since then, I stand corrected.
As regards the many groups to be housed in our new bird house
which Mr. Wiener quotes from my paper, and which on account of their
number afford him opportunity&apos; for sarcastic comment, let me remind him
that we are a very&apos; young Zoological Park as yet,--a child of six short years
as compared with the octogenarian Zoo in Regent's Park, and our bird
buildings number as yet only four. All told, we have not more than 1,600
or 1,700 specimens in the collection, which, however, are in perfect health.
So closely&apos; did we gauge the groups which would here find housing, that
every group quoted from my&apos; paper by&apos; Mr. Wiener on page 104 of the
January Avicultural DFagazine is now represented by&apos; from one to one-
hundred-and-fifty individuals, with the sole exception of the Bower-birds
and Sand-grouse, of which we have not as yet been able to secure specimens.
With the 900 birds in the building, there are at present no less than seven-
teen cages which are unoccupied.
Seven partitions have been removed from cages in various parts of
the building, thus throwing two or three cages together, and further attest-
ing the value of flight cages of moderate size. In fact, these have proved
successful in every way&apos;. With all the constant moving about of birds,
and the frequent disturbances incident upon the first year in a new build-
ing, a number of birds have nested and raised young,--doves, pigeons,
parrakeets and finches, -- and the numerous eggs dropped upon the sand by-
birds not yet provided with nests, give hope that even in the matter of
breeding Mr. Wiener is mistaken.
That gentleman can hardly&apos; have seen parrots in a wild state if lie says
they&apos; seldom fly&apos; for the pure love of flying. My lasting impression of
Macaws, Parrots and Parrakeets in Mexico, is of birds constantly on
the wing, making high, overhead, direct flights, or swinging in large flocks
around and across a barranca for an hour or more.
The complete success of our great outdoor flying cage for waders and
swimmers, measuring 75 ft. by&apos;:50 ft. by 55 ft. in height, prepared us for a
similar result in large aviaries, protected by&apos; a roof of glass, which is pro-
vided with such generous ventilation that in summer the tenants have all
the advantages of an out-of-doors home.
As regards the difficulty of identification, 1 have found that most of
the American public possess a large share of that curiosity which is so
pronounced a characteristic of many of our more humble brethren of the
earth. I have often seen people pass rapidly by&apos; several cages, each of
which contained a single species, giving but a glance at the label. But
in the case of the great central cage of the new bird house, where some 150
birds live happily together, running in and out of the minature millet
fields, and flying around the Norfolk and cabbage palms and cinnamon

trees, the task of identifying some interesting member of the fifty-odd
species offers itself as a fascinating game. Every species is carefully
delineated in oils upon an individual descriptive label, so that the task is
not difficult; and the result is that considerable knowledge of several
species of birds is gained. Seldom is a keeper appealed to for this infor-
mation, and this objection to large aviaries seems nil.
My heartiest congratulations are due to Mr. Pocock and to other
members of the Avicultural Society for a vindication of the most humane
and successful way of quartering the feathered beings which we all love so
well. C. William Beebe,

Sir, --Most of Mr. Wiener's criticisms have already been replied to in
anticipation. To quote myself" . . . if there should be a timid bird
or a shy feeder, its haunts are located and needs supplied. ... If plenty
of simple food be supplied, there will not be any overeating. Birds requir-
ing exceptional food and exceptional treatment should not be kept in a
general aviary. Of course there will always be a scramble for special
delicacies--which as a ride the birds are better without." In what way
these words are inapplicable to insectivorous birds I fail to see. Speaking
generally, mealworms are by no means a necessity for them--I referred to
mealworms as a special delicacy which as a rule the birds are better without.
Again I said:--"The principle of the aviary is good; but of course
intelligence and common sense must be applied in its construction, and to
the nature and number of the birds to be placed in each aviary. As
Mr. Wiener himself argues, birds cannot be packed together like stuffed
specimens in a glass case. Yet the more I think over his article the more
I feel that most of his troubles he brought down upon himself by errors in
this direction." To give a pair of Pies (species not stated) an opportunity
of killing a ' little Dove,'or a pair of such murderous villains as Carrion
Crows a chance of slaughtering a ' poor young newly arrived Gull ' does not
suggest to me (I do not know who was in fault) either intelligence or
common sense, nor to allow two birds to die from want of suitable nourish-
ment. Mr. Wiener persists in citing such cases as these as arguments
against the aviary--but it is not the aviary that is in fault. Has Mr. Wiener
forgotten that under certain conditions even the gods are powerless? Mr.
Wiener adds that a " crowded aviary spells disappointment and death," but
nobody but Mr. Wiener insists on the necessity of the crowded aviary. But
even so, a crowded aviary is not the fault of the aviary; possibly he desires
surreptitiously to suggest that we ought to make the aviaries larger so that
the birds may have more space!
Mr. Wiener writes:--"Mr. Phillipps frankly says he detests cages and

favours aviaries. The question is what sort of cages does he condemn, what
sized aviaries does he favour, which cardinal points he does not mention."
To give the size of a hypothetical aviary would be childish, the size of an
aviarv must depend so entirely upon circumstances. My aviary covers
every inch of ground at my disposal; it consists of my entire garden
covered over with wire netting. People may laugh at it because it is only a
miserable London back garden, but that is my misfortune not my fault; if I
could make it larger I most certainly should do so, and very much larger
too. It is a trifle under 48 ft. X 18 ft. x 10 ft. high, and can be used as one
or divided into two parts. The one end abuts on to the back of the house,
and covers the garden door and, amongst others, the lower half of the
window of an ordinary ground-floor room 12^ ft. X 12 ft. x 9^ ft. high
which serves as the birdroom, the aviary and birdroom being connected by
his window.
As a home for birds, I detest (as the result of years of trial) everything
that can be called a cage or aviary-cage. I have only two in regular use this
winter, one on the top of the other, in my dining-room. The lower is
6 ft. X 2 ft. X 2 ft. high, and contains such of the small foreign birds as do
not winter satisfactorily in the birdroom. The upper is of the same length
and breadth but, having a gable roof, is some inches higher. It now con-
tains only a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills, just the arrangement Mr. Wiener
recommends--but the cage is more suitable than his are I think. The
incessant singing of the male is very pleasing--but it is as pleasing when
heard in the aviary. They were so set on nesting that, contrary to my
inclinations, I gave in and let them have their way. When laying com-
menced about a fortnight back, I came down every morning fearing disaster,
but happily the female got safely over her troubles --and the eggs were eaten
by the male!* What is there of interest in that? In an aviary this would
not have occurred, at any rate they would have done their best to " breed a
progeny," which so few will do in a cage, and which still fewer would do in
one of Mr. Wiener's cages exposed to the close public inspection he still
advocates. So far as my caged birds are concerned, they are wintered in
ca^es because I am unable to provide better accommodation for them ; but,
as soon as May comes round and weather permits, out every one of them
goes into the garden aviary--and out into the aviary would they go were
it many times as large as it is.
It seems to me that Mr. Wiener gives himself away, and likewise his
case by letting in daylight, when he says that he knows but two ways--a
gun or a fire engine (in January, 1901, his gardener's small hot-house syringe
was a sufficiently potent weapon--O.S. VII., p. 59)--of catching a bird in
what he calls a huge aviary (and here again he beats the air, as only for
special birds would one take the Canal Bank aviary as a pattern). After
such a statement, one feels that Mr. Wiener can never have been a boy,
,* The female has again laid, and again have the eggs been eaten.--It. P.

*certainly not an English country boy. I may refer him to the third
paragraph of page 143 and to Mr. Seth-Smith's footnote on page 1S5.
The catching of birds in an aviary leads up to a matter which I should
like to mention for the information of birdlovers. Years ago, when I had
many more birds than I now possess, I had several 'houses' along the
sides of the aviary, and I till keep up one (not counting the Burrowing
\0x25A0Owls' house) which is about 4 |ft. x 3! ft. X 4^ ft. high. The doors are
large, and are left open except when a house is temporarily required for
new arrivals, &amp;c. They are of great value, are very convenient, and
facilitate the catching of birds, for in these they find food and protection
from the weather, and most of them frequent, or at least occasionally visit,
one or other of the houses. I cannot too strongly recommend them.
"Inner cages opening into open-air ones " may be very draughty and
are answerable for many deaths ; but " Inner aviaries opening into open-air
ones" need not be draughty if they be large enough and arranged with
intelligence.
The breeding of Budgerigars is so very common that it would be a
pity to waste an aviary on them. A flock of Canaries would be as interest-
ing--or more so.
I do not agree with Mr. Wiener that "a few dozen common small
birds at lialf-a-crown the dozen might as well be put in (to a large or open-
air aviary) as rare and unique pairs." The chance spectator is not the
only person to be considered. However, when a male and female of a
really unique or desirable species turn up, by all means let them have a
place to themselves for a time, only let it be large enough. But pairs of
unique species do not come to hand so frequently as to affect the general
rule that even small birds are infinitely more happy and interesting in
aviaries than they are in cages ; and kindly note that when I talk of aviaries
I do not mean the toy aviaries to which Mr. Wiener makes somewhat
frequent allusion, and in which he almost seems to suppose I keep my
pets summer and winter. Reginald Phiggipps.
Sir, --Pressure of other business has prevented me from writing to
3 T ou sooner on this most important subject which has been raised by Mr.
Wiener, but I will now endeavour to put thepros and cons of the case, as it
strikes me, in as clear and concise a manner as possible.
First of all, let me relate four cases from my own experience. In my
first aviaries at Cambridge I had three ' cages,' about 2 ft. long by 18 inches
high and deep. I11 the topmost of these there was a pair of Bearded Tits ;
in-the second a pair of Great Tits; and in the last a pair of Corncrakes.
The Bearded Tits laid and hatched, but failed to rear; the Great Tits laid,
and the Corncrakes laid, hatched, and reared, so that in those cases, at all
events, the ' cage' life suited the occupants. I have since had both Bearded
Tits and Corncrakes in an aviary with other birds, but have not succeeded
under these circumstances in getting them even to attempt to breed.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
The next case I wish to cite is that of two pairs of Black Kites,
received from the same place at the same time and of the same age. These
all lived together for some years in a large and lofty barn. In the spring of
1904 I placed a pair in a small 'cage,' 6 ft. x 8 ft. X 8 ft. high, giving them
a basket with some sticks, while a similar basket was placed against a wall
some fifteen feet from the ground inside the barn. The pair in the ' cage '
laid and hatched, while those in the larger place contented themselves by
merely playing abont with the nesting material.
O11 another occasion I went in for mule breeding, and put up four
Canaries with four Goldfinches. Two of these latter had been for over a
year flying in an aviary with other birds, while the other two had spent the
winter in a bird-catcher's 'back cage' (6 inches x 4 inches x 8 inches high)
and had been carried about for catching others, in all weathers, during the
whole winter. Mules were only hatched and reared from the bird-catcher's
birds.
Lastly, I may instance my hybrid Ducks, which are all bred in small
pens about 10 ft. X 12 ft., while on the pond, where several pairs were kept
together, I could never get more than one pair to breed owing to the drake
of the nesting pair driving all the other birds about; and a similar story
might be told of my sniall bird aviary.
These practical experiences then all point to one truth, which has
long been known to practical bird breeders, viz., that success in breeding is
attained most surely by segregating pairs in moderate sized cages. And
since it stands to reason that a bird does not breed except in good health, it
follows, therefore, that moderate sized cages are not detrimental to a bird's
health. In fact, the converse is true, namely, that many species can be
kept in better health in cages, since every individual can have personal
attention, and be given the special delicacies required for its perfect health.
Again, in 'cages' the birds can be more easily and closely seen, and
their beauty more appreciated, while, at the same time, their moults and
changes of plumage can be better studied, so that they thus become (pro-
vided control experiments under more natural conditions are made) of
greater scientific interest.
Therefore, the arguments in favour of cages may be summed up as
follows :--
(i.) Birds in as good or better health.
(ii.) Breed better, more freely, and more successfully.
(iii.) Can be better seen and studied for scientific purposes, as well as
being more interesting and instructive to the ordinary bird
lover.
(iv.) They become much tamer.
Now what are the arguments on the other side ?
First, and perhaps chiefly the sentimental reason, viz., that it is cruel
to closely confine them. But surely this objection must largely disappear
(for sentiment will never entirely surrender to reason) when it is pointed out

(i.) That the cages are of ' moderate size,' and the inmates are not
therefore closely confined.
(ii.) That the birds can, as has already been proved, be kept in better
health.
(iii). That nothing can be more cruel than the presence in an aviary
of a 'bully' or a cantankerous species, of which all the
other inmates live in terror, as we have been shown in the
earlier portion of this discussion.
The second, and perhaps the most valid reason in favour of aviaries,
is that it enables the birds to show off their habits and movements better;
which is in fact the case if the}&apos; allow themselves to be observed. In
practice, however, their habits and movements are almost entirely kept for
the early morning.
The other main argument in favour of aviaries is their greater
economy of labour and food.
Now in a Zoological Gardens, whose chief aim, apart from scientific
study, should be to amuse and instruct the public, the small extra expense
of food need not count, while as keepers are on duty all day the economy of
labour is likewise of comparatively little moment. At the same time, the
object is not so much to breed as to interest and instruct the casual visitor,
to attract and centre his attention, a matter which I maintain can be more
easily done when he can see and closely examine a bird in a cage and com-
pare it with its near allies.
I can hear some reader saying that this is usurping the function of a
Museum, but my reply is that the functions of a public Zoological Gardens
and a Museum are, or should be, fundamentally the same, with a large
balance in favour of greater instruction on the side of the living exhibit.
The birds, being able to be closely watched, their mode of feeding, kind of
food, etc., etc., may be studied and compared in a way impossible where
many species exist together in large aviaries. Of course I am presupposing
that there should be careful arrangement so that their different habits, etc
might be easily seen and compared. For instance, a Wryneck, Tree-Creeper,
Woodpecker, and Nuthatch might be placed in contiguous cages as
examples of various methods of climbing; the various modes of breaking
and eating seed might be illustrated by examples of Tits, Buntings, Finches,
Crossbill, Quail, and Bearded Reedling, the method being still further
worked out by giving the last-named feathery reed tops, the Crossbill
fircones, the Goldfinch thistles, when in season, the various points of note
being made evident by clearly written and concise labels. Another series
might show the different methods of insect feeding, the Warblers, Tits, and
Scops Owl, forming good examples of three different modes; or again the
use of the feet for holding of food, examples where it is held in one foot
only being found among the Parrots, Owls, and Gallinules, or among the
Tits, Jays, and Hawks, where it is held on the ground with both feet.

These are only given as examples of the possibilities of instruction
and interest which cages would render possible, and which would be capable
of infinite variety according to the season and living examples at hand.
At the same time, of course, in a public garden one would naturally expect
a few large aviaries, which would in fact become a necessity, in order to
accommodate surplus stock, or the sudden arrival of large consignments;
but every garden should, in my opinion, have many of these so-called
" cages," and I would also suggest that their contents should be varied
from time to time in order to illustrate new phases of habits or variations-
of plumage in allied species, etc., etc., according to the living material
available.
From the point of view of the private aviculturist the case is some-
what different. If his object be chiefly to breed rare species he will of
course favour 'cages'; if his object be rather to keep a crowd of rare and
beautiful birds he will have a few aviaries ; if his object be scientific he
will have to go in for both cages and aviaries, so that his methods will
naturally have to vary according to his purse, his inclinations, and his
object, but after this discussion he will at least be in a position to consider
the question of cage v. aviary from a new and more enlightened stand-
point. &apos; J- Lewis Bonhote.
THE HONEY BUZZARD IN CAPTIVITY.
The Honey Buzzard is a species very seldom kept in captivity, so that
the account of one kept by Mr. J. G. Millais, which appeared in the Field
of Feb. 24th last is of great interest. The bird had been wounded by a shot,
at the tip of its wing and, being otherwise uninjured, Mr. Millais determined
to keep it alive if possible, and he found it by far the most interesting pet
he ever possessed. Regarding its food he writes, " For more than a week it
refused all food, so that I feared it would soon die of starvation. Little
birds, frogs, and insects were offered in vain, and only as an experiment did
I force a French plum down its throat, for that was the nearest approach
to honey at hand. To my surprise the bird picked up and swallowed the
next plum with avidity, and from that moment I had no trouble with the
menu. It lived on French plums and their juice for a month, when I
managed to procure heather honey from Scotland ; and principally on this-
diet, varied with the contents of an occasional wasp's nest in September, I
kept it until the end of the winter. As an instance of the extraordinary
tastes of this species, I may mention that Lord Lilford fed his bird on rice
pudding."
The bird was of a most amiable and gentle disposition, and became
greatly attached to its owner to whom it would fly on his approach. It was
carried about the garden on Mr. Millais' arm and he carried it about in
search of bees and wasps, which it captured with remarkable grace and
certainty, sailing on steady pinions up to the insect, by which it alighted,
giving it a nip with its beak and then swallowing it.

The account of this bird's attack 011 a wasps' nest maybe quoted here
in full. " I shall never forget the first time we went to attack a wasps' nest
to which a farm boy&apos; was guiding me. ' Where is it ? ' I said to the boy, but
before he gave the answer the Honey Buzzard suddenly stretched its neck,
and, intently watching a wasp that went by threw itself into the air, and
with great rapidity flew low and straight to the ' bike ' about a hundred
yards distant and situated in a high bank. In a moment the bird was
suddenly transformed from a listless apathetic dullard to a most energetic
and business-like excavator. It used its beak occassioually to pull aside a
root or other obstruction, but most of the work of unearthing the nest was
done with the feet. Meanwhile the wasps in access of fury swarmed all
over the bird, and of these little tormenters it seemed to take not the
smallest notice, a circumstance explained, as I afterwards found out, by the
fact that though the wasps entered the plumage with their heads and could
even reach the skin they nevertheless found it impossible to screw round
their metathorax and sting the bird owing to the way in which it held the
feathers and to the strength and elasticity of the down. During its meal
the bird swallowed grubs, comb, and full grown wasps, and for three days
afterwards wasps still remained in its plumage. This seemed to cause the
buzzard no inconvenience, but rather a pleasant supply, for I constantly
saw it during this time searching its plumage and abstracting wasps, which
it at once nipped and swallowed or allowed to drop to the ground."
THE LATE CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW.
Sir,--I do not think you are quite just to the Malachite Sun Bird.
I have no wish to dispute the general opinion that Mr. Townsend's beauti-
ful Tanager should have been placed first at the Crystal Palace Show, but
when you say that there is no reason why the Malachite Sun Bird should
be rare on the show bench I do not agree with you. A bird may be very
common in its native country, and yet a rarity here. Some birds are very
difficult to adapt to conditions of travel and captivity, and I think the Sun
Birds may be fairly classed with these. Mr. Hanilyu lost about 85 per cent,
of those he attempted to bring over from South Africa on his last return
journey, although he attended to them himself. Of the few that arrived I
received four on January&apos; 15th last. Two were Malachite Sun Birds. The
other two I have reason to believe were the Double-collared Sun Bird
(Cinnyris chloropygius) ; both of these latter died within a fortnight. I
always dissect birds of doubtful sex after death, and so discovered these
to be male and female. They were olive-coloured, but the male had a few
bright red feathers on the breast, and some metallic blue specks on the
throat and back.
All four Sun Birds appeared free from disease, but they were all
miserably&apos; thin and in very poor plumage. Of the two Malachite Sun
Birds, one died on Feb. 7th ; I think I should have saved the other if I had

not been so unwise as to send it to the Crystal Palace Show. It became
more lively every day, and at length commenced to sing. One can hardly
hope to get a bird into show condition within four weeks of its arrival, but
the life of a Sun Bird in England is too uncertain to be sure of its living
another year, so I decided to exhibit it at once. On the Monday of the
Show it was reported to me that the bird was in a bad way, and I sent to
beg the manager to allow me to remove it from the Show. I think a warm
bath and freedom from the further attention of visitors might have pulled
it round. But the manager was obdurate. So many people were asking to
see the Sun Bird that he could not let it go. I believe it was still alive at
the close of the Show, but when it arrived home in the evening it was dead.
The faulty condition of the poor Sun Bird was emphasised by the
perfect condition of its near neighbours, the exhibits of Mr. S. M. Townsend,
more especially his Black-backed Tauager. Is this bird correctly named ?
I am open to correction, but I think not. The books I have seen on the
subject give a very different description for the Black-backed Tanager
{Euphonia melanonota) to the coloured plate of Mr. Townsend's bird in
Bird Notes. The skin labelled Black-backed Tanager in the British Museum
collection also differs. I think Mr. Townsend's bird is the Black-shouldered
Tanager (Calliste melanota). L. W. Hawkins.
[We quite admit that a Sun Bird is a most difficult bird to import and
to keep in captivity, and perhaps we were a little hard on Mr. Hawkins'
specimen in our report of the Show. Nevertheless the Malachite Sun Bird
is a very common bird in South Africa, and with care it should not be at all
impossible for a skilful aviculturist to bring home several specimens. But
the point we intended to emphasize was that when the judging took place
the Sun Bird was evidently decidedly out of sorts, while the equally rare
Black-backed Tanager was quite perfect.
Mr. Hawkins' Sun Bird was fed on honey at the Show and, we under-
stand, during the voyage home, but we are not by any means convinced
that this is the correct food for these birds. Stark informs 11s that this
species feeds, not only on the saccharine juices of various flowering shrubs,
but also on insects which it finds among the petals, and especially upon
small beetles and spiders, while it sometimes catches flies on the wing.
When the nectar from flowers has passed through the body of the bee and
become honey, it is chemically changed into quite a different substance to
that which the Sun Birds obtain in a wild state. Captain Pam found that
the best food for Humming Birds was syrup made from molasses, to which
was added a small amount of meat extract to take the place of insects. It
seems probable that this would be a more suitable food than honey for Sun
Birds also, and possibly Mr. Hamlyn might have been more successful in
importing these birds had he used it.
It is not encouraging to an exhibitor, who begs for permission to take
a bird home when he sees that it will die if left at the Show, to be told by

the managers that it must remain even at the risk of its life, as the public
wish to see it!
Mr. Townsend's Black-backed Tauager is certainly a male of Calliste
melanonota. I11 the skins in the British Museum some of the pale blue on
the wings has faded, and become brownish, but otherwise the specimens
agree with Mr. Townsend's bird.--E d.]

Sir, --I am writing to ask you if you would identify a Lorikeet (or it
may be a Lory as I cannot find it in " Parrakeets.") Two of them were
rather palmed off on my servant, who went down for me to Lahore on a
bird errand. They were received in a dreadful panting condition, and
filthily dirty. One has already died after apparently recovering a little;
the other, a brighter cleaner bird, looks much better, but I do not trust it to
live. In good condition, they ought to be lovely birds. I see in the
Avicultural Magazine that a Hull dealer advertises Violet and Red Lories,
I should say that the tails of my birds resemble that of a Musky or a
Forsten's rather than that of a Purple-capped Lory, wfiiich is the only Lory
I know; also their small size, smaller than a Musky, seems to demand the
affix " keet " The following is a description : Forehead, lores, sides of face,
ear coverts, and fore part of crown--red, the remainder of the head, neck,
nape, throat--black, each feather with a purple (or deep violet) fringe.
Breast, thighs, flanks near the thighs, and under wing-coverts are red. The
under tail-coverts are red fringed purple. The remaining under parts are
black fringed purple. Tail, above general appearance--dull reddish purple,
with black shafts; underneath the red predominates and the feathers are
brown shafted! Centre feathers (four) reddish purple altogether; outer
feathers show more and more red on their inner web as the} 7 near the out-
side. Scapulars red, look as if they might at seasons have a purple fringe.
The lower feathers of scapulars are black, almost concealed by the red of
the upper ones. The back, rump, and upper tail-coverts red, the feathers
011 the upper back look like the red scapulars. Primaries and primary-
coverts, outer feathers are almost completely black with a red mark on
centre of inner web, this red rapidly increases inwards; the inner primary
coverts and secondary coverts are red, the lower feathers with black tips.
The secondaries are practically red with black tips, the red increasing in-
wards. Feathers of quills are black shafted. Iris, black surrounded by
orange ring; cere, dark brown; upper mandible orange; lower paler,
almost yellow ; legs, feet, and claws, horn colour. The depth of fringe
varies, narrower in centre, i.e. the feathers show almost black on chin
and centre of throat and abdomen.
Size, to base of tail, nearly five inches; tail, three inches, but the

tail is in very bad condition, and one might safely allow half an inch more
at least.
I might also mention that I have a rarity for which I am not properly
grateful, a Yellow-mantled Parrakeet (P. splendidus). Last winter I bought
two reputed pairs of Rosellas from the Tiretta Bazaar, Calcutta, so as to
give myself a decent chance of really getting one pair. They were none of
them in good condition, and I put down difference in plumage to simple
variations as sex, coming from different parts of the county, or moult ;
and not knowing then that there was a Parrakeet very like the Rosella, did
not bother much about it. This spring two moulted into beautiful birds,
while the other two remained miserable specimens, never got their tails or
the use of their wings. One died in the rains, and the other is in fine
*colour, but has no tail to speak of and cannot fly. I had thought that
there might be a chance that these two miserable birds might be a different
species for some time past, but never bothered to look them up, especially
as, unless routed out, the birds were seldom seen except at the seed pan in
the evening. The two good Rosellas are undoubted common Rosellas,
though I must say there is no trace of yellowish green on rumps or upper
tail coverts, which are pure light green. The other is also undoubtedly the
Yellow-mantled one, and&apos;I wish it was a Common, which are apparently
much hardier, and I hate to have odd birds of a sort. I am sure both my
Many-colours and Redrumps would now be breeding, but unfortunately the
former are both hens and the latter are cocks, and they are hardly on
speaking terms.
One of my Muskies has died, when apparently quite fit, but the three
survivors are very fit: the pair give me great hopes of young, and the odd
bird gets rather a poor time. I have hopes of his chumming up with the
odd red Lorikeet. These Muskies have given me away in my previous
statements concerning them in the Avicultural Magazine of September 1905.
They now like clean water to bathe in just as well as dirty, and now
their staple diet consists of bread and milk sop instead of Canary seed,
though they still largely partake of this seed. They are very fond of apple,
pear, medlars, and watery plums, but do not care for apricots or bananas.
Flowers they revel in, a flower something like a Marigold (we call them
French Marigold) has been invaluable, though it has a strong pungent smell
when crushed. It grows like a weed here, and lasts from September to
February ; flowers are preferred, but the plant, especially when young, is
also greedily eaten, and seems to suit the Parrakeets well. My estimated
length of the Musky is correct, total length is a little over ten inches, of
which four consists of tail (to base).
I hope my description of the red bird will suffice, though I know that
even the best description is very unsatisfactory as compared with a skin for
purposes of identification. G. A. PERREAU (Capt).

<bodyText confidence="0.981282242424242" page_id="32720644"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I was pleased to see in the last issue of the Avicultural
Magazine the illustrated account of the Quail Finch.
In Vol. II., First Series, page 94, a query from me re these birds was
printed and answered by Mr. J. Abrahams on page ill (May, 1896). I sold
the birds then referred to to Mr. Arrowsmith for a good figure some time
after. They laid two clutches of eggs after the above date 011 the floor in
the corner of the room ; first lot consisting of four and a second lot of
five.
In building they used fine moss, thistle-down and hay entwined in
the straggling twigs of plants. They were very seldom to be seen. At the
least noise of a door opening they were the first to dart into their secluded
quarters. The first clutch of eggs appeared to have been trodden on br-
other birds, as small holes, such as might have been made by toe nails,
showed on examination. The others were, I believe, molested and eaten by
some Ribbon Finches before I could remove them.
One day I found these birds chasing the Quail Finches about the
room. I also saw that the cock Cut-throat had yolk of egg 011 his bill one
morning. The birds were very young when I got them, and became much
brighter after the moult, when they were a fac-simile of the illustration in
last month's issue. The colours were nicely toned down and they looked
little gems. I have never seen or heard of any others until now.

THE SIZE AND COLOUR OF AVIARY-BRED BUDGERIGARS.
Sir, --In the March number of the Avicultural Magazine Mr. Wiener
states, on page 182, re Budgerigars: " It has been found that these birds
bred in Europe are paler in their plumage." This has not been my ex-
perience, and I have bred some thousands in the last 25 years. Many times
my season's young have numbered from 400 to 500. Unless inbred (which
should be strictly avoided), birds bred in outdoor aviaries and properly
moulted, are far superior to Australian imported birds both in size and shape,
and equal the best of them in colour; in fact, imported birds would stand
no chance whatever on the Show bench against aviary-bred specimens.

AVICULTURE AND SCIENCE.

Sir, --When, in 1894, the Avicultural Society was founded by a little
band of bird-lovers (of whom Dr. C. S. Simpson, Mr. R. Phillipps, Dr. A.
G. Butler, and I, were the leaders), the keeping of British and Foreign
aviary birds in captivity was a pursuit which could not lay claim to relation-
ship with any branch of science. The founders sought to establish friendly
relations between practical bird-keepers and ornithologists, to induce bird-
keepers to adopt the nomenclature and classification of the ornithologists,
and to shew ornithologists that their science could receive valuable help
from bird-keepers. Those who claimed to be both practical bird-keepers

and, at any rate to some extent, ornithologists, were called aviculturists,
and this term, which was in this application the invention of the founders
of the Society, has become the standard name for all those who study
captive birds from a scientific standpoint, (or who are supposed to do so).
In the twelve years which have elapsed these aims of the founders of the
Society have been, to a large extent, accomplished, and what is called
scientific aviculture has acquired an assured position.
But in 1894 when we talked about science we meant the science of
ornithology, and I do not think that in those days it occurred to us that
aviculture bore any practical relationship to any other branch of science.
The sciences of avian pathology and hj&apos;giene were scarcel}&apos; in existence.
We had our own notions of the proper treatment of birds in health and
disease, which were founded partly on tradition, partly on the recorded
experience of various writers on birds, and partly on deductions, often
erroneous, drawn from observations of human beings and other mammals.
Avian pathology may be said to have first taken shape as a definite
science some eight or ten years ago, when Dr. R. H. Clarke published some
important discoveries in Fur and Feather as to the nature of " bird-fever "
or " canary-plague " (so-called), and its causes and possible methods of
prevention. Dr. Clarke has been engaged for many years in original patho-
logical and physiological research, he is a collaborator with Sir Victor
Horsley, and is in the front rank of modern medical science.
Dr. Clarke, when he relinquished practical aviculture, did not further
pursue his investigations into avian pathology, but the subject was taken
up by his intimate friend Dr. W. Geo. Creswell, who has for some years
past devoted a large part of his time, and an equally large share of his
abundant skill and energy, to the solution of various problems connected
with the hygiene of captive birds. Chiefly in consequence of the work of
Dr. Creswell, we have now begun to see that aviculture, if it is to be in any
true sense scientific, must be correlated to the sciences of hygiene and
pathology as well as to that of ornithology. As I have pointed out, the
Avicnltural Society, when in its infancy, was the principal means of making
aviculture scientific on its ornithological side. Will the Society now refuse
its whole-hearted support to an effort to make our pursuit scientific on an
even more important side, that of the health, and consequent comfort and
happiness, of our birds ?
Dr. Creswell has arrived at conclusions, on various points, which are
of great interest and importance : some of these may be briefly summarized
as follows,--
1. That fresh air and aseptic conditions are of more importance to
birds than heat.
2. That avian tuberculosis is, to say the least, an extremely rare
disease among cage-birds : so rare indeed that although Dr. Creswell has
performed many hundreds of post mortem examinations of birds he has

neveryetfoundaca.se. Consequently, the idea that "consumption" may
be contracted from cage-birds is a myth.
3. That the cause of death of newly imported and freshly caught
birds is in most cases septicaemia, and that this disease is the cause of death
in the case of a large proportion of all captive birds.
4. That the use of egg-food appreciably increases the risk of septi-
caemia, especially when it is supplied to birds for the feeding of their
nestlings, which are necessarily extremely non-resistant.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.77584625">
5. That the use of egg-food in any form as a food for any kind of
birds is unnecessary and undesirable from more than one point of view.
6. That post mortem examination of birds is of comparatively little
value unless accompanied by microscopical investigation by a pathologist.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994309333333333" page_id="32720646"  page_num="215" year="" vol="">
Many of these conclusions run counter to the views which prominent
writers on aviculture have expressed in the past, and which some of them
continue to express in the present. The time has arrived when the}&apos; should
either be disproved, or frankly accepted.
It must be admitted that these conclusions are of the very first impor-
tance to aviculturists, if proved. They are of much more importance than
those matters of names for which we fought twelve years ago. The great
question for us to consider is, "Are they proved?" We must remember
that they are put forward by a Doctor of Medicine who has made a special
study of the subject, and therefore have a prima facie right to attentive
consideration. If they are wrong, let them be shewn to be so by evidence
and argument.
Let us take the tuberculosis question as a test case. Dr. Creswell
has asserted that tuberculosis is a very rare disease with cage-birds, and
that the disease commonly called by that name is not tuberculosis but
septicaemia. Recent letters in the pages of a contemporary shew that
Dr. Creswell's position on this point is considered as proved by the follow-
ing medical men,-- S. H. Snell, M.D. and B.S. (Loud.), J. Sim Wallace, D.Sc.,
M.D., George Master, M.B., B.C., and Thos. Salt, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. On
the other hand we have one medical practitioner, Mr. Mylau, who asserts
the contrary.
It is well known that Dr. Creswell and I (who am regarded as his
leading non-medical supporter), are, for different reasons, the two best-
hated men in the world of aviculture to-day. There are quite a number of
prominent aviculturists who would gladly go to considerable trouble to
prove either of us in the wrong, or to make either of us look foolish. Well,
Dr. Creswell has challenged anyone to prove him in the wrong on this
tuberculosis question, and I now venture to repeat that challenge on his
behalf.
But while I welcome evidence and argument, I protest against the sly
endeavours of " Onlooker " to undermine Dr. Creswell's reputation for
accuracy by spiteful criticism of his work in other directions. This letter
is already much too long, and I cannot go into the question of the alleged

errors in the monograph on the Wild Canary, but I must ask to be allowed
to comment on one remark of "Onlooker's." He says that he " offered
(through a mutual friend) to reply in his own journal to Dr. Creswell, but
received no answer." The truth is that a proposal was made through a
gentleman then officially connected with Bird Notes, that a letter (which
was specified as one of unfriendly criticism from "Onlooker") should be
published in that journal with the proviso that the name of the writer was
not to be disclosed to the Editor, and furthermore a threat was held out that
capital would be made out of it if it was refused. I question whether any
Editor in the Kingdom would accept contributions on such terms, and the
suggestion was very properly ignored, Horatio R. Fieemer.
[That fresh air is of more importance to birds than warmth has been
long known to most aviculturists, and we fail to see that any new discovery
has been made in this direction, but of course it is ridiculous to suppose
that delicate birds from tropical countries can enjoy life in our bleak
climate without artificial warmth. An Englishman might as well expect to
live and enjoy himself at the North Pole in the winter, with the same
costume he wears at home during summer-time.
As to whether cage-birds suffer from tuberculosis, or whether what
has generally been taken to be tuberculosis is really septicaemia must be
left for the pathologists to decide between themselves; but we are strongly
of opinion that the alleged harmfulness of yolk of egg as a food for birds
has not yet been proved. We have used it largely for rearing young birds
and have not found it harmful. To take the case of young ground-birds
such as Quails, Hemipodes and Tinamous, which we have reared in some
numbers. Unless living animal food can be obtained, the yolk of eggs is
the only food these young birds will touch. Some will not even touch this,
but others eat it readily and, instead of dying from septicaemia, grow up to be
healthy and sturdy birds; (preserved ants' cocoons, dried flies and suchlike
are never touched). Why then should we discard the use of this valuable
substance ? It is not for aviculturists, who do not profess to be patholo-
gists, to prove that Dr. Creswell and his supporters are wrong, it is for
these latter gentlemen to prove that the}&apos; are right, and so far we fail to see
that they have done so. Ed.]
THE VERNACULAR NAMES OF BIRDS.
The following note appears in the Auk for October last:
An article in a recent number of the ' Avicultural Magazine' entitled 'The Breeding&apos;
of Song-Sparrows,' records the mating of a male Pileated Song-Sparrow with a female
White-eyebrowed Song-Sparrow, and their successful rearing of young, of course ill an
aviary. While the fact is in itself of interest, we greatly question whether any readers of
'The Auk ' would be able to recognize in the "White-eyebrowed Song-Sparrow " our well-
known White-crowned Sparrow without the aid of the technical name, Zonotrichia leu-
cophrys, which fortunately accompanies the 'English' name. We have often wondered
why it is that English writers so persistently and methodically ignore the American ver-
nacular names of American birds, when they have occasion to refer to them. It is a

general habit of long-standing, so that in citing the present instance there is no intention
of criticising the 'Avicultural Magazine,' but merelj&apos; to call attention to a general prac-
tice, not only in reference to birds but to other American animals, for which we have never
been able to find a reasonable explanation. We might probably fill pages with lists of
names like case here cited. Our birds have standard vernacular names by which they are
known to all American bird students, and being the book names of the birds employed by
all American writers they cannot be unknown to intelligent bird students abroad. Where
then is the sense for useing a stilted translation, as in the case of the " White-eyebrowed
Song-Sparrow," of its Latin specific designation in place of its simple and far more
characteristic American name of ' White-crowned Sparrow ? ' To make matters worse, the
species is not even a ' Song-Sparrow,' which is a generic designation applied universally in
America to a large group of wholly different birds, to which the White-crowned Sparrow is
not closely related. It is the custom of American writers, when referring to the birds of
other English speaking countries, to employ the names current in the countries where the
birds live, and we do not see why it is not a good method for our English friends to
follow when speaking of American birds. If they could bring themselves to do this their
references to American birds would often be not only more intelligible but save some
annoyance to American readers.
Ill the first place it may be remarked, incidental!}&apos;, that the male
parent of the hybrids was Zonotrichia leucophrys, and the female Z. pileata,
not vice versa as stated in the above quotation from the Auk.
The. species of Zonotrichia most frequently imported into this country
is Z. pileata, a bird that has always been known here as the Chingolo or
Pileated Song-Sparrow. In the last published list (Vol. 9) of Vertebrates in
the Zoological Society's Gardens, there are three species of Zonotrichia , two
of which are called " Song-Sparrows," and the third, Z. leucophrys, is
termed the "White-eyebrowed Finch." To term two species of the genus
"Song-Sparrows" and the third merely a "Finch" is inconsistent and
misleading, and therefore in the article which the Auk refers to I called
Z. leucophrys a " Song-Sparrow " to which term it is quite as much entitled
as are either Z. pileata or Z. albicollis. Nevertheless I quite admit that
in this country we ought to recognise the vernacular names employed in
other English-speaking countries for birds which are natives of those
countries, so long as these are appropriate. In the United States the term
" Song-Sparrow" is applied only to the genus Melospiza, and it seems that
we must term the species of Zonotiichia merely Sparrows, which hardly
seems a suitable appellation.
I11 cases in which the vernacular name is eminently unsuitable, as
it often is, we in this couutry are surely entitled to adopt a term
that is more appropriate. For instance, in Australia several of the Parra-
keets are termed " Lories," which are in no way entitled to this designation.
The well-known King Parrakeet is called the " King Lory," the Crimson-
wing ( Ptistes erythropterus) the " Red-winged Lory," and sometimes Pennant's
Parrakeet is called the " Crimson Lory," and the Yellow-rumped Parrakeet
the " Swamp Lory." The term " Lory," should, of course be confined to
the Loriidce, the Brusli-tongued, honey-eating Parrots. But there is no
reason why we should not, where possible, follow the Australian vernacular

THE YELLOW-NAPE D PARRAKEET.
Sir,--I notice that most, if not all, books state that the sexes of the
Yellow-naped Parrakeets are alike. I have recently bought a couple (sup-
posed to be a pair) in their nest feathers. The one supposed to be the cock
has a red band over the nose like the adult birds, while the other, the
smaller bird, has no red over her nose. If I am successful in rearing these
I shall be careful to note whether they turn out as supposed. I know
another member has secured a pair (supposed), and they have, I think, the
same difference as mine.
I would like to know if anyone else has noted this difference in the
Yellow-naped Parrakeets. Mr. Fasey tells me that his adult hen (which I
bred) has the red nose band. F. H. Rudkin.
[We believe that the red frontal-band is common to both sexes of
Barnardius semitorquatus when fully adult, and that the only noticeable
difference is that the male is a trifle larger and brighter in colour than the

A Member of the Society has suggested that the Magazine would
prove a more useful medium for advertising members surplus birds, &amp;c., if
advertisements could be received up to within two or three days of the
publication of the Magazine. The only way of doing this would be to
print the advertisements on a separate slip of paper, which would be in-
serted loose in each copy, or perhaps stitched in at the last moment. This
would mean some extra expense, and it would probably be necessary to
slightly raise the present very low charge that is made for private adver-
tisements; but it might be a great convenience to Members if these could
be accepted, say up to the 26th of each mouth.
We should be glad to hear the opinion of Members on this subject,
so that the matter can be laid before the Committee.

SANDGROUSE.
By E. G. B. Mkade-Waldo, M.B.O.U.
The exquisite family of Sandgrouse has had a great
attraction for me for many years. Their wonderful colouring that,
although so bizarre in many cases, is yet so invisible in their
desolate surroundings. The comparative ease in which they can
be kept in confinement at apparently great comfort to them-
selves, for I know no birds so contented as they. The interest
attached to their most peculiar breeding habits, and the wonder-
ful seasonal changes in plumage in at least one species all tend
to make them an attractive group. Of the species that I am best
acquainted with all but one appear to be quite hardy in an open
unheated aviary in this country, at any rate in the South of
England, and the exception is the Western Painted Sandgrouse,
Pterocles quadricinctus , probably all the group are the same ; but
P. arenarius, P, senegallus, Pteroclurus alchatus, (and its Western
representative P. pyrenaicus), P. exustus, Syrrhaptes paradoxus ,
and, I presume, Pterocles coronatus, are all quite hardy and
require only a roomy and dry aviary, well protected from wind,
south or south-east exposure, and an open-fronted but roofed-in
compartment, where they can bask in the sun and shelter; the
front compartment should contain a lawn, kept mown, surrounded
with a well-rolled gravel path. The floor of the back compart-
ment is far better if of natural soil, as the birds can bask in it and
dust when the open compartment is too moist. It is well to
have the soil everywhere well beaten down and firm, as the birds
will not sit properly if the soil is loose and the eggs get half
buried in sand or dry earth. They eat all small seeds, lawn

mixture, maw, liemp, rape, spray millet, etc. They are also
great consumers of green food, and are especially fond of
shepherd's purse, watercress and dandelion. Their green food
should always be placed under a weight so that they can pluck
it. Plenty of lime in the form of old mortar should always be
before them, and of course a block of rock salt. Sandgrouse
become extremely tame and are most confiding, but are liable
to sudden panics, which makes it advisable to curtail the powers
of flight, but not entirely to stop their flying, as their feathers
are so lightly attached that if they try to fly and tumble over,
half their plumage appears to come out! I find the best way
is to cut fairly short seven primaries in each wing, leaving the
first and second untouched, they can then just fly but not with
sufficient force to injure themselves. They are very heavy birds
and fly with immense force. And the advantage in cutting the
feathers in this manner- is that, except when trying to fly, the
birds look much better, as they appear to be full-winged.
Sandgrouse seem to pair for life, although they pack when
out of the breeding season, at least an old hen Greater Pintailed
Sandgrouse that has laid and reared her young in my aviary each
year since 1895 has done so ; that is except when she has lost her
mate, for she has had three husbands in this period. It was in 1895
that I first described the nesting habits of Sandgrouse from this
old hen who, during the summer of 1904 for the first time, nested
twice , rearing two broods of young ! Hitherto, after having
reared young she has not wanted to nest again. When she has
laid too early in the season I have removed the eggs after allow-
ing her to sit a short while. On these occasions she has always
been sitting again on a full clutch of three eggs (generally a
much finer clutch than her first) on the eighth day after her first
eggs had been removed. The object of removing early clutches
has been that the ripening seed of shepherd's purse has not
been procurable in sufficient quantity early in the season.
Incubation lasts from twenty-one to twenty-three days ; the hen
sits by day, the cock taking her place by night, usually going on
the eggs about 5 p.111. ; three eggs are a full clutch. The young
when hatched quickly become independent, and about the tenth
day separate at night, roosting away from their parents, and as

far as possible from each other, not settling down into their final
resting place until it is almost dark. Both parents brood the
young when they are very small.
The extraordinary method employed by the parent Sand-
grouse, of conveying water to their young by saturating the
feathers of their breasts, was first described by me in 1895, and
since by Mr. St. Quintin in his interesting account of the success-
ful rearing of the Lesser Pintailed Sandgrouse, P. exustics. I have
had the good fortune to see the males of Pterocles arenarius, the
Black-breasted Sandgrouse, and Pteroclurus alchatus , the Greater
Pintailed Sandgrouse getting water for their young in a wild state,
but, had I not seen it administered in confinement, would have
considered them to have been demented birds trying to dust in
mud and water, when unlimited dusting ground surrounded them
on every side. In very waterless districts where the only water
procurable was from deep wells situated at great distances from
one another, this method of procuring water must be most
precarious, for I saw P. arenarius waiting by the wells and going
to the muddy spots where the skins used to be laid before being
loaded on to the camels, and where the water was slopped over
from the troughs where the animals drank. I also saw them fly
over the prickly zareba surrounding the tent-villages, and go to
where there was a soft spot for the same purpose. I did see P.
alchatus actually soaking themselves, they were much wilder,
and also in less arid places, but I repeatedly saw cocks pass over,
their white breasts soaked in mud and water. Doubtless the
whole group of Sandgrouse obtain water in this manner, although
I can only answer for the three species mentioned. In this order it
is invidious to single out one species as being more beautiful than
another, but I should be inclined to think that the Western form
of Pintailed Sandgrouse, Pterochincs pyrenaicus, an intensified
form of P. alchatus to be the most beautiful. It is in this species
that the seasonal changes are so marked. It is impossible to
describe them clearly without a long series of plates, but roughly,
there is the first nestling plumage which is assumed from the
down. This is moulted in the autumn into the winter plumage.
In the very early spring this again is changed into the breeding
plumage, and the cock in the late summer puts on an eclipse

dress resembling the hen except that the slate bine bars on the
back are missing. As far as I can ascertain these changes are
brought about by complete renewal of feathers, and all are
complete, but the eclipse plumage is only perfect in adult and
vigorous birds; otherwise the feathers that are first shed partake
of the character of breeding plumage and eclipse, and those last
moulted of eclipse and winter plumage.

fiyre?iaic 7 is, in full breeding plumage and a chick about two

AVICULTURE IN SOUTH AFRICA.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99208408" page_id="32720659"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
By Captain B. R. Horsbrugh, A.S.C., M.B.O.U.
In writing of aviculture in S. Africa I think I should
mention that my own experiences have taken place solely in the
Orange River Colony, but at the same time I make no apologies
for the title of this article, as the general conditions throughout
South Africa in so far resemble each other as to bear much the
same relationship toward bird-life.
I have never kept birds in aviaries in the Transvaal or in
Cape Colony, but have trekked extensively through both and
have had many chances of observing birds in their wild state
and in captivity.
To the aviculturist out here the first of the many advan-
tages toward bird-keeping is the constant sunlight. The nights
are often very cold, windy, and frosty, but the ever recurring
sunshine makes up for the hardships endured. True, there are
storms,--days when the heavens open up and pour down such a
volume of water as is seldom experienced in England, and it is
then that the flooded out aviary must take its chance, and a
shelter from the prevailing winds is an absolute necessity.
Sometimes hailstones as large as pigeon's eggs occur with
disastrous consequences to birds roosting out of shelter; never-
theless with any degree of luck and the careful placing of an
aviary I do not think the losses from storms need be extensive.
In the last ten months I have had at one time or another over
150 birds of different species, and the losses attributable to

<bodyText confidence="0.998000315789473" page_id="32720660"  page_num="223" year="" vol="">
storms are not over a dozen. One distinct advantage in the
keeping of insectivorous birds is--in the Bloemfontein district--
the great abundance of ant-hills. It is only necessary to arm a
Kaffir with a trowel and a bucket, to have him return within
half-an-hour with the bucket full of ant hill simply swarming
with white ants, their queer maggot-like larvae, and other crawl-
ing things which live in ant hills, and of whose names I am
ignorant. All these are much appreciated by nearly all species,
in fact, I hardly know how the birds could exist without them.
In the summer months there are nests of black and of red ants
under nearly every stone, and their cocoons are greatly enjoyed,
as are also the grasshoppers, locusts, and caterpillars that are
present in huge variety.
After rain- and hail-storms, chief in the category of dis-
advantages is the lack of bird dealers and bird shops, and the
difficulty of obtaining bird seed save in the mixed state, and the
impossibility of getting millet in the spray. Century food I
import from home, but such things as crissel and game meal are
unheard of out here, and inquiries for them are only met by un-
comprehending stares.
I find it comparatively easy to trap my own birds, and have
also various small boy collectors living in the town or on farms
in the district, who bring in the captures as they get them. In
this latter way the various species of Serin are easily obtainable
at the average price of sixpence each. The insectivorous birds
are more difficult to get in good condition, as they are brought to
me nearly dead from terror and want of food, and are invariably
fed quite wrongly.
The Violet-eared Waxbill ( E. granatina) is a local and
scarce resident here, its chief haunts are along the banks of the
Modder River, which are covered with dense acacia and other
bush. At present I have four pairs, and three or four odd cocks,
all of which are now becoming fairly tame. The local name is
" Rove Bird," and of course I thought of Agafornis, though I
could not quite make out what they were doing in this part of
the world, and it took me a long time to realise what these so-
called Lovebirds really were.
I took a trip myself some weeks ago to the Modder River,

squamij?&apos; 0 ?is), see Stark&apos;s Birds of S. Africa ,
page 86, Vol. I., and also a Tit Babbler
(.Parisovia subcoeruletim )
I find 5". squamifrons a most attractive
little bird in an aviary, but very difficult to
reconcile to captivity. Of the seventeen
I got on this occasion all died except one, which is now in
splendid feather and health, and lives in company with three
others I bought from one of my small collectors. In April last
this little bird was breeding in the bush along the Modder
literally in thousands. In one small acacia, or " wait-a-bit ,r
thorn about 20 feet high, there were over two hundred nests, five
of us counted to the best.of our ability. All had eggs or newly-
hatched young, and the noise reminded me of cicadas.
We plucked some Guinea Fowl near our camp, and it was
interesting to watch the procession of these little fellows, each
with a big spotted feather in his pink beak, beating with all his
power against the heavy wind that was blowing.
Sporopipes squamifro7is has just bred in my aviary, there
was only one young one reared, which is now flying about with
its parents. It is exactly like them, but has a dull yellow
beak with a black spot on the end of it, and it lacks the shield of
seal}&apos;- feathers on the top of its head, from which the bird takes
its name.
April--the month when this species was breeding in the
open --seems a queer time of the year for building out here ; it
corresponds nearly to October at home and the nights are dis-
tinctly chilly, but birds in general seem to have no fixed time for
nesting here, and just breed when they feel so inclined, or what
I expect to be the true explanation, when their particular food
is most plentiful.
Some months ago I got a few pairs of the White-browed
Weaver ( Ploceipasser mahali ). Most of these I sent to the Pre-
toria Zoological Gardens, where they had not been previously
represented I believe, but I kept one pair for myself. I bore
Sporopipes squamifrons,
from B. of S. Africa.

with them for a long time, too long my household said, for they
had the most dreadful alarm-note, which went off at all hours of
the night, and often brought me out with my gun to look for the
cause of trouble. Generally there wasn't any, and I got very
tired of this, and after offering them to all my bird friends, who
sometimes accepted them but always returned them, I let them
go-
P. mahali is however a very interesting species, having no
seasonal change of plumage and quite a cheerful song, but being
as big as a Thrush and very powerful and pugnacious it is not
fitted for an aviary which contains smaller species.
On the 20th of last April I was shooting Quail in some
longish grass when three birds got up that I thought were
Rufous Coursers. I did not fire at them and they settled quite
close ; when I flushed them again, however, only two rose. I
looked about and suddenly saw a small speckled bird crouched
on the grass, with its neck stretched out straight in front of it
along the ground, in the same attitude in which the young
Thicknee is stuffed in the Museum at South Kensington.
Camp was quite near, and I made the little fellow comfort-
able in a big biscuit tin with some grass to sit on and a butterfly
net over the top to prevent his escape. He got home to my
aviary safely and is now ridiculously tame. Mealworms and
chopped meat were forced down his throat every day for about a
week, when he suddenly learnt to feed himself and took well to
Century food. By July 1st he got his adult plumage, and to my
great surprise turned out to be the much rarer Double-bauded
Courser ( Rhinoptilus bicinctus ); all the same I am almost certain
he was accompanied by two old Red Coursers ( Cursorius rufus).
When first caught he simply swarmed with bird lice, and hand-
ling him was a most unpleasant job. I had to catch him a few
days ago, however, and he seemed quite free of them. At the
present date, Feb. 10th, 1906, he is still alive and well and in
perfect plumage. I got a second Courser some months later, but
the original bird promptly scalped him or her. Every night he
treats us to a sort of song, a long, shrill, rattling call note, which
sounds so loud as to be out of all proportion to the bird that
gives utterance to it.

226 On Aviculture in South Africa.
Among the other birds in my aviary one of the most
interesting is the Tit Babbler ( Parisoma szibcoeriileuni). It has a
loud chattering metallic call-note and is a little ash-coloured bird
with long fan tail edged with white, and a bright chestnut vent.
It rather reminds me of a Hedge Sparrow, but it never seems to
fly, getting about the large aviary by the most prodigious bounds.
It is a regular Babbler in some of its ways, and loves to cuddle
and tickle any other bird that will allow such liberties, its chief
friends being the Zosterops and the Blue-breasted Waxbills ( E .
angolensis&apos;). It lives on white ants, rotten bananas, and over-ripe
fruit of any kind, Century food, and the rinds of Camembert
cheese, over which it is very greedy. Odd as it may appear,
nearly all birds like Glossy Starlings, Babblers, Bulbuls, Barbets,
Zosterops pallida , and various others are simply ravenous for
cheese as long as it is chopped fine enough for them to swallow.
I find Century food nearly invaluable out here, and it is the
staple food of most of my insectivorous species. Indeed the
Courser, for whom it was originally imported, has much difficulty
in getting his proper share as there is great competition for it,
and he is a very slow and deliberate feeder, and gets flustered
when he has a lot of uninvited guests.
Another interesting bird I have had some months is the
Cape Robin ( Cossypha cajfra .) It is about the size of the Shama,
and very much reminds me of that bird in its habits and large
expressive eye. Its long tail, coloured like a Redstart's, is always
on the move, and the bird is quite one of the most active I know.
It usually sings towards evening a plaintive and most attractive
song of sweet, loud, and long drawn out notes. I found a nest
of this species on November 20th, which was built in a crotch in
an old low pollard wild olive, and was just in the same sort of
position in which you would find our home Robin breeding.
I11 a future article I hope to record some notes on the
latest additions to my aviary during 1906, as well as upon the
Blue Knorhaan ( Otis coerulesce 7 is&apos;), a species which I have now
kept in captivity for nearly a year.

By W. G. Pbrcival.
I was living for some time opposite the mouth of the
Atbara and constantly noticed birds on the numerous small islets
that dot the Nile at this point. So, having a morning to spare,
and the boat being at liberty, I paid them a visit. On the first,
which was a pretty islet of sand and rocks, with large tussocks
of tall grass growing between, I found, after some searching
(although it was not more than seven yards square), an egg of
the Senegal Thicknee ( CEdic?iemus senegale?isis&apos;) on a bare ledge
of stone. On a rock close by, about a yard and a half square,
was a clutch of three Spur-winged Plovers' (. Hoplopterus sphiosus )
eggs, laid in a slight hollow. A little lower down on a sandbank,
some 15 by 2 yards, from which the then falling river had only
receded in the previous four or five days, I found three nests, or
rather hollows in the sand, containing one egg each of the
Scissor-billed Tern Rhyncops flciviventris. Drifting downstream
to another small sandbank, I lauded and found two more clutches
of Spur-wing Plovers, both hollows were sopping wet, and in
one an egg was buried, almost entirely, only a tiny portion of
shell being visible. Several Egyptian Plover (P. cegypticzis&apos;) were
flying round anxiously, but as they bury their eggs in the sand,
it is useless trying to find them unless one has time to stop and
watch the birds. Still further downstream was a nice little spit
of sand with a collection of piled up rocks at one end amongst
which tall grass luxuriated. On the islet were two Geese ( Chena -
lopex cegypticzis&apos;). Thinking more of the pot than anything else
I shot one, the female (containing one egg). On landing I soon
spotted the nest and five eggs which I took ; amongst the grass
was a small roughly-built cup-sliaped nest, which I fancy be-
longed to a Sparrow. Somewhere, too, was aThicknees', judging
by the excited condition of the pair of old birds, but in spite of a
careful search I failed to find it. Some distance away were
several good sized sandbanks covered with boulders, and on one
of these, with my glasses, I could see a number of Scissor-billed
Terns sitting and, on another, Sparrows innumerable, several
Spurwiug and Egyptian Plover and a pair of Thicknees. On the

Mr. Reginald Phieeipps,
first were eight Terns' nests, containing one to three eggs each.
In contrast to the first nests fonnd, these were large deep hollows
lined with bits of white shell and quite conspicuous. There was
also one Spurwing Plovers' with three eggs. On the second
sandbank the holes in the ground under every rock contained
one and often two or more Sparrows' nests; in all there were
hundreds on this and neighbouring islands. Several more Spur-
wing Plovers' nests showed up, but the Thicknees' I could not
find. The only other Thicknees' nest I have found since was on
an island, in a hollow of loose sand under a bush. My attention
was drawn to it by noticing a number of tracts leading to it.
From the Plovers' and Terns' eggs that I took, my
cook made two excellent, though strong and richly-coloured,
omelettes, and the five gooses' eggs came in well for cooking.
The shells were of course kept for the collection.

Malurus cyaneus.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
In the September and November, 1902, numbers of our
Magazine, I gave an account of the successful breeding, in my
garden aviary here in London, of this very interesting Australian
species. At page 247, vol. VIII., while carefully pointing out
that too much importance must not be attached to my experience
which was limited to my own three birds, a male and two females,
I stated that the evidence, so far as it went, did not altogether
support the generally received opinion that the male Blue Wren
is a polygamist. I was informed--of course by those who had
never kept the bird--that I was mistaken and all the rest of it;
and I had to receive the rebuff with due humility, not having
anything further of value to say on the subject.
A few days ago, on looking through the latest number of
the Emu, I found that at last, even in Australia, it has been pub-
licly asserted that the Blue Wrens (. Malurus ) are not polygamous.
In a paper read by Mr. A. G. Campbell, Melbourne, before
the members of the Australasian Ornithologists' Union at
Adelaide on the 13th October, 1905, which is published in part

Further Notes on the Blue Wren. 229
3, vol. V. of the Emu , at page 154 1 find the following:--"I hold,,
too, in connection with the Bine Wren, that it is not polygamous.
Certainly there are often seen several brown ones with each male
bird, but these are lonely spinsters, or possibly young birds, that
follow him about for company. In parts where males are very
common this is not noticed. The mature blue bird has the ex-
perience that can find the food supply, scent danger, and ward off
enemies. But this and other matters in connection with this
brilliant genus are awaiting more enlightenment." It will, there-
fore, be seen that I am not alone in supposing that the reputed
polygamous nature of the male Blue Wren is in need of further
investigation. Of course I can speak only of M. cyaneus, but
Mr. A. G. Campbell refers to the whole of the genus Malurtis.
All the same we must not go too fast, or peradventure we
may topple over 011 to the other side.
It must not be forgotten (N.S., I., pp. 15-16) that my male,
who up to a certain point had been so devoted to his baby, after
a while handed it over to the care of its mother, completely
deserting both, and went off apparently in search of the missing
Spinster Aunt, as the second female was called. Although so
hostile to that inestimable lady whilst he was breeding with No.
i, I am of opinion that he would afterwards have gone to nest
with her had the weather and circumstances permitted. I11
districts where there are not any spare females, each male might
naturally be expected to be more or less contented with a single
mate, but where there may happen to be a superabundance of
females, especially in a hot climate, the reverse would not by any
means be particularly improbable. Possibly, as I suggested in
1902, he may take them in turn, each cast off mother, as in the
case of my birds, being left to look after her own brood by her-
self. They are said to rear two or three broods between August
and January, but perhaps each may be by a different mother ;
and sometimes, as suggested by Mr. A. G. Campbell, the sup-
posed extra females, or some of them, may be simply young
birds--members of the first batch.
The author of Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds (pp.
165--8) quotes various statements of others that the Blue Wrens
are polygamous, but is not, or was not, himself fully satisfied on

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
the point. On page 167 he sums up with :--" To Mr. Holroyd
now belongs the credit of having first placed on record that the
beautiful Blue Wren is a polygamist, or at all events he has
established that more than one female to a nest assists in the
incubation. However, it has yet to be proved that more than
one bird lays in the same nest--a statement I have doubts about.
I never recollect flushing a male bird from the nest, therefore it
is possible that at times one female may relieve the other at
sitting, if the male does not share in that task." As Mr. A. G.
Campbell says, the matter awaits more enlightenment. Would
not a systematic examination of the number and style of the
eggs in a series of nests shew whether they had been laid by
one or by more than one female?
Let us now turn to another point in the life history of our
merry little blue friend.
The title of Mr. A.. G. Campbell's paper is:--" The Moult
of the Blue Wren (Malurus) "; and in addition to his own
\0x25A0observations he gives those of a friend on this subject. These
are all, of course, notes on the wild birds in their native country.
It occurs to me that a few notes on the moult of M. cyaneus (the
only species of the genus I have kept) on this side of the world
should perhaps be placed on record, as my experiences 011 this
point are, I suppose, absolutely unique.
O11 26 May, 1902, I received a male and two females almost
immediately after their arrival in this country. The male was
not in colour, but was easily distinguishable owing to his blackish
bill and dark tail. These points of difference between him and
the females shewed, moreover, that he was an adult bird, for the
immature male is like the female--if I may venture to found a
statement on my London-bred baby male.
According to a writer in Vol. II. of the Emu, page 12, in
the wild state the male may be found coming into colour in
August for the Australian summer and going out of colour in
February for the Australian winter--for British readers must bear
in mind that summer here is winter in Australia and vice versa.
But the dates of change seem to vary somewhat as might be ex-
pected in so large a country, and Mr. A. G. Campbell tells us
that some under his observation were out of colour from March

until the following June or July, one mentioned by his corres-
pondent not being in full colour until September 13.
Mr. A. G. Campbell refers to two annual moults. His
actual words at page 154 are :--" Male Wren moulting, Mar., '04 - r
remoulting, first week July. Moulting Mar., '05; remoulting,
first week in June." Does he mean that the bird passes through
two actual moults every year, or does he speak a little loosely
(a) as referring to the going out of and coming into colour, or
(b) because he is not quite sure of his ground ? I think the latter
is not unlikely for, in connection with the bird going out of
colour in March, he adds :--" This moult is a complete changing
of feathers, and is not a mere alteration of pigment"; but as
regards the coming into colour he is silent, making no statement
beyond what I have quoted above, although rather lingering over
the pigment process in certain other species before returning to
the Blue Wreu. With wild birds, a full moult is usually betrayed
by the state of the tail; but when the tails tell no tales (pardon
me) the observer often cannot be certain how a change of colour is
produced. Probably such was the case with Mr. A. G. Campbell:
he could not detect a moult, he was cognizant only of the access
of colour.
It is in a case like this that aviculture is so valuable ; a
bird in captivity can be watched in a way that is impossible with
the wild bird.
So far as the autumnal moult is concerned, the going
out of colour, there seems to be no question. My birds, young
and old, males and females, like Mr. A. G. Campbell's, have
undergone a complete change of feathers in September and
October, the British autumn, commencing early in September
and completing in October, which about corresponds with March
in Australia--the Australian autumn.
My young male, bred July, 1902, for the fourth year came
into colour this March, the British spring, the process occupying
about a fortnight; and each year the change has taken place in
a six-foot cage in my dining-room. One point is certain--there
is no general moult at this season. I11 the autumn, while the blue
feathers are being shed, minute though these feathers are, they
can be found and identified owing to their bright colour (N.S., I.,

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
p. 18). Far different is it in the spring when the feathers shed, if
shed they be, are plain whity-brown things, for the feathers
afiected are so small it is most difficult to find them, and, if
found, to say positively that they come from the Blue Wren. Of
the old male who was just commencing to come into colour on the
ist June, 1902, I noted on that day that he seemed to be coming
into colour by direct moult. Of the young male, beyond the dates,
I have not any notes on the manner in which the change has been
taking place year after year, but have been accepting the partial-
moult theory without question. This March, having it in my
mind to put pen to paper, I made careful search for cast feathers.
Not a feather could be found in the cage, but, blown out by the
birds' wings, on the carpet outside I succeeded in finding a few
tiny ones. There are several other little birds in the cage, but I
am reasonably satisfied that at any rate some, probably most or
all, must have belonged- to the Blue Wren. Indeed, I cannot
think from what other bird they could have come, for none other
was shedding feathers. I am of opinion it will be safe to say
that Malurus cyaneus obtains his summer plumes by a direct
moult of certain of the small feathers.
It is interesting to add that the young male did not obtain
his dark bill and tail, nor colour of any kind, during his first
moult in the British autumn of 1902; all through the winter of
1902-3 he remained like the females. On 4 March, 1903, the
three were cuddling together, and then for the first time I noticed
that the throat and chest of one were dark compared with the
other two, but all still had the yellow bill. Although the black
feathers of the throat and a black band across the chest are about
the first parts of the wedding outfit to make their appearance,
yet it was not until the 18th I found that the young bird was an
assured male, and the delay I do not fully understand. It was
not until the glint of the blue caught my eye that I, with much
satisfaction, accepted the situation--for owing to the light colour
of the bill I had scarcely gone so far as to hope that it might be
a male. At this time the bill was still of a light colour; it was
not until April 11 I noted that the bill was " dark except at the
tip." But when did the tail assume its dark colour ? most un-
fortunately I did not watch this point. There must have been

such an increase of pigment or colouring matter of some kind
in the system, at any rate on this first spring, this approachment
to maturity, as not only to give colour to the new feathers but
also to shade the under-front feathers in advance, to darken the
tail and blacken the bill.
The old male moulted in the autumn of 1902, and then
immediately recommenced to come into colour--although autumn
here it was the Australian spring. He got completely mixed as
regards the seasons, the strain was too great for his frail little
body, and he died on October 27. The young male, hatched in
July, 1902, was in this connection a regular Britisher, moulting
and renioulting true to the British seasons.
In 1903, the summer plumage of the young male was not
so brilliant as that of his father had been, presumably 011 account
of his youth, for it is stated that" The perfect wedding dress
of the male bird.can be seen only in his third year "
(Nests and Eggs, p, 167). Probably, also, it was owing to his
youth that there was 110 actual breeding during 1903. In 1904
and 1905 the plumage was faultless, a light silvery blue, so
brilliant that, in shade or gloom, his whereabouts in the garden
aviary could almost always be detected. This year the blue
seemed to lack much of the silvery glint which had been so
great an attraction.
The Spinster Aunt, who during 1902 so constantly squeezed
through the wire and played truant (O.S. VIII., pp. 247-8), be-
haved nearly as badly the following summer, and was killed by
1113^ neighbour's cat on June 7. She had full powers of flight,
and could easily have saved herself had she but used her wings ;
but when in danger these birds do not trust to their small wings
and comparatively feeble powers of flight, but to their legs.
They do not run but hop and bound, and can scuttle along at a
great rate, and make for the nearest bush or thicket, into which
they will glide like mice and hide in any hole or shelter.
The mother was found dead in her six-foot winter cage
on the morning of 20 January, 1904, having been apparently
frightened in the dark by a Mesia which I had found looking bad
late on the previous evening and had hurriedly placed in the cage,
and which I think had a fit during the night.

Mr. Reginald Phieeipps,
Little did I contemplate when I commenced writing this
article that, before it was finished, I should also have to record
the death of the "Last of the Blue Wrens," j^et so it has come
to pass, so slender is the thread by which hangs the life of these
little creatures. On March 21, having cleared the Violet Ears
out of the top cage referred to on page 204, thinking to shew a
kindness to my little pet--for the cage in which he had passed
the winter was sufficiently crowded, and some of the finches were
doing themselves no good with his food--I placed him up above
with only a pair of Cuba Finches (.Phonipara canora), and the
next morning I found him in a state of collapse from cold, and,
although he temporarily revived, he died during the following
night. He had been in the habit of sleeping cuddling up with
the other birds, the old female White-eared Grassfinch, likewise a
solitary stranger in a strange land, which was figured in our issue
for August, 1898, being his particular chum ; but in his new cage
he had too much " fresh air," and possibly was prevented from
finding a nice roosting place owing to the truculent disposition of
the male Cuba Finch--and so there has passed away the only
Blue Wren that has ever been bred here, the only representative
of the genus Malurus on this side of the world, for probably
there is not another Blue Wren of any species nearer than the
Australian Region, some thousands of miles away.
I found that the spring plumage was fully developed. A
few new tail feathers were sprouting, but these were only coming
to replace some which had been accidentally lost a good while
previously.
Blue Wrens, although nearly as pugnacious as Bluethroats
( Cyanecula ), at any rate among themselves, unlike them are timid
little things and, as far as practicable, should not be handled nor
netted. Although so tame and familiar, any attempt towards
handling them seems to fill their wee cowerin timorous breasties
with terror; and small wonder, for they are so fragile the slightest
slip and they are done for; and yet during the summer mouths
they do marvellously well in the natural garden aviary, far better
than in the largest cage, presupposing the presence of plenty of
suitable covert. A large faggot-lieap in one corner of my aviary,
cunningly furnished with various snug shelters, suited them

admirably for ordinary purposes ; but for nesting in and building
sleeping nests, chiefly of hay, they preferred the many-stalked
half dead and almost leafless stems of some rather old Virginia
creepers, of course specially trained and arranged for the birds.
Owing to the predilection of Blue Wrens for scuttling along
the ground into holes and corners, it is easy to catch them in
suitably constructed box-traps, and thus to transfer them from
aviary to winter quarters and back again, backwards and forwards,
without touching a feather.
In a well wooded garden aviary, Blue Wrens can mostly
support themselves, especially in warm weather, on the tiniest of
tiny insect life, which they search for not solely on the ground
by any means but also freely amongst the stems and leaves of
growing trees and shrubs, doing naught but good, for I have
never seen them touch the leaf-buds. In the house the plainest
of insectivorous food will suffice, but egg-flake must form one of
the principal ingredients according to my experience, supple-
mented by any tiny insect life and spiders that may be obtainable.
The one great danger to be guarded against is-- Fresh
Air ! ! ! Say what you like, with delicate birds, Fresh air kills,
while a stuffy atmosphere, objectionable though it be, need not
do so, nor need it sow the seeds of disease or impair the health.
With some species warmth is a necessity, and stands in import-
ance before everything else. I never fail to lose a good bird if I
neglect warmth.
If our learned friends would direct their rather wasted
energies towards finding out some practical means of keeping a
private living room warm, night and day, without smoking the
curtains, ceiling and wall paper, they would indeed be conferring
a boon and a blessing on men who, like myself, are obliged to
keep a few of their frailer pets in their dining-room during the
cold season. It was disgust at the state of the room that caused
the death of the Blue Wren: a smoky paraffin stove or two
during the night of March 21--22 would have saved him.
Given warmth and intelligent care, there is no real diffi-
culty in keeping the Blue Wren.

A GUACHARO CAVE.

In the island of Trinidad the Oil-bird, Steatornis caripe 7 isis,
is locally called the " Guacharo " or perhaps it is still more
familiarly known as the " Diablotin " or "Little Devil." It owes
its first-mentioned name to the fact that the young are coated
with abundant quantities of fat. To procure this in certain
parts of South America the natives kill large numbers of nest-
lings and from their fatty covering are able to produce a highly
useful oil. To taxonomists this species is of singular interest as
it forms a family group entirely by itself. Superficially--and
this is all that concerns us here--it somewhat resembles a large
Goatsucker, with dark, chocolate-coloured plumage, lightly
barred on the upper surface, and bearing a few white spots about
the shoulders and Breast. During the hours of daylight the
Diablotin habitually remains concealed in certain large caverns,
only emerging therefrom as twilight falls over the land. In
Trinidad, as elsewhere, tenanted caves are few and far between,
but in some there exist very large colonies, occasionally con-
sisting of several thousands of individuals. Unfortunately, the
cave that I visited during my stay in the West Indies was not
peopled by one of these vast assemblies; to make a modest
estimate, I should think it hardly contained more than two
hundred pairs, or two hundred and fifty at the outside.
I set out upon the expedition I am about to describe one
day in mid-December, two negroes accompanying me as guides.
The men first led me to a little cove where we found, lying
on the white beach, a small and frail looking boat. Exposure to
the weather had apparently widened her seams, for no sooner
did we launch her than she commenced to fill with alarming
rapidity and I was obliged to bale vigorously to keep her afloat.
For more than an hour we followed the shore, keeping as close in
as possible to avoid the choppy head-sea that was running. The
tropical scenery of the coast was very beautiful, for the land fell
sheer to the sea's edge and displayed a luxuriant forest growth
even to the spray-splashed rocks at the foot of the cliffs. Among
these boulders sat the solemn Brown Pelican of the tropics,

while here and there a little Sandpiper might be seen trotting
along the shore. Overhead, Vultures circled lazily in the sun-
lit sky and far out, over the Venezuelan coast, a great Frigate
Bird hung almost motionless in the heavens.
When we finally reached the entrance of the Guacharo
cave, we were confronted with our first real difficulty. How
were we to enter the grotto ? The waves, moderate though they
were, sucked and gurgled ominously among the rocks that
choked the mouth, and to approach them meant considerable
danger to the already insecure boat. It was only after two or
three futile attempts that we were able to gain a landing and,
soaked to the skin, struggle on to the slippery barrier. To go
further, we now found it necessary to doff our garments and
enter the water. This swim, from the brilliant light of day into
the depths of an unknown cavern, was a weird experience that I
am never likely to forget. Hardly had we taken to the water
before the Diablotins became restless and commenced to utter a
curious " cluttering " sound, and one or two could be seen flutter-
ing across the gloom. As we trespassed still further on their
seclusion, swimming through the narrow entrance, this cluttering
sound--impossible to describe on paper--gave way to harsh,
raucous screams, and the air soon became filled with shadowy
phantoms. Before long all the birds had taken wing and were
hovering in the green twilight of the vault--brown, flickering
forms, uttering wild cries that echoed weirdly in the hollow roof.
A faint, musty odour, emanating from the birds, mingled with the
natural sulphurous fumes of the chamber and further enhanced the
hellish effect of the situation. It was now easy to understand
why these strange creatures had been named " Tittle Devils."
No species could possibly have made a deeper impression upon
one's imagination than these uncouth troglodytes, with their
fiendish cries, their ghostly flight and their faint evasive odour.
Fortunately the water was not very deep towards the ex-
tremity of the cave, and we were presently able to feel the
ground under our feet. This gave us leisure to observe that the
upper ledges were festooned with numbers of massive, Swallow-
like nests. Near these a few Diablotins would sometimes alight

birds would peer down at us with great frightened eyes, reflect-
ing the distant gleam of day in bright pin-points of light.
Being very anxious to examine their nests at closer quarters,
I tried to induce my negro companion to lead the way up the
precipitous wall of the cavern. This, after some demur, he
presently undertook, having first procured a strong bamboo cane
from the boat outside. The task was by no means easy and the
fellow had to advance with extreme caution, making his way, bit
by bit, into the darkness of the roof, where the frantic crowd of
birds still criss-crossed, screaming now with increased fear. I
followed as well as I could, but my toes were not so prehensile
as those of my black companion, nor had I such muscular
fingers wherewith to retain my grip, and it was only after much
trepidation that I was able to gain the comparative safety of
the narrow cornice that we sought. On examination, we found
the nests to be slightly raised platforms, constructed of some
clay-like material, a shallow concavity being formed to receive
the eggs. On all sides the rocks were strewn with a dark
brown deposit. In appearance this deposit exactly resembled
the substance known as "moss litter" among horse-owners,
which is really broken up peat-moss, used as bedding for horses
and cattle.
Being, of course, naked, the cavern soon began to feel chilly,
and presently I desired to return to my clothes. But this was
easier said than done. If it had been difficult to get up, it was
trebly so to get down, and the more I looked the less I liked the
prospect. Certainly, there was a little water below to break our fall,
should we lose our hold--(without it we would never have attempt-
ed the climb)--but a slip nevertheless meant an ugly tumble that
would have probably ended in a very serious accident. Going
first, I had the advantage of the bamboo, which the man held
downwards to assist my descent and by its help, I managed to
pass the most awkward point and finally reach the bottom in
safety. But how was my companion to get down unaided ? In
truth, I liked the prospects in store for him but little, and I could
see, by the anxious face that peered over the ledge, that my
fears were more than shared by the negro. His features were
distraught and terrified and I am sure he never felt so like a

white man before. I watched the proceedings with close interest.
Slowly, very slowly, the black figure was lowered over the
sloping edge of the tiny platform : then there was a deadly
pause. The two feet felt the air and pawed at the cliff,
vainly seeking a crevice. I thought nothing could save
him--that he was bound to fall--but presently one of his toes
found a resting place and he was able to relieve the precarious
hold he had had with his hands. The worst was now passed and
the fellow was soon by my side in the water.
"I would'en go up dere again fur ten t'ousand dollars--
no, I would'en ; dat's de solemn truth," he cried. " I jus' hel' on
by one finger in a li'l bit of a crack. I pray to de Lord de crack
may hoi'. De crack did liol' ; udderwise I'm done fur." And all
the way home he kept reiterating, " No, Sar, not fur ten t'ousand
dollars," and, honestly, I think it would have been cheap at that!
Personally a King's ransom would not have tempted me back.
STRAY NOTES.
A solitary female Eclectus belonging to Sir William Ingram laid an
egg in lier cage and proceeded to incubate it steadily. It was removed and
a bantam's egg put in its place which was duly hatched out by the
Eclectus.
The Rev. Hubert Astley writes from his villa in Italy, " On my return
here the other day, I noticed that the hen Spathopterus alexandrce was
hardly ever to be seen about the aviary, so I cautiously opened the doors of
some nesting - boxes and discovered her in one of these, sitting on five
beautiful eggs, about the size of those of a Barbary Dove. She seems to be
an excellent mother, and if, when she is hastily snatching a well-earned
meal, she sees any bird perch near the entrance hole to her nest, she is up
and back to the eggs at once." We are sure all members will wish Mr.
Astley every success with the beautiful Queen Alexandra Parralteet.
We have never seen, to our recollection, or even heard of a hybrid
between the Many-coloured and Redrump Parrakeets, though such closely-
allied forms should cross without much difficulty. It had often occurred to
the present writer to try and obtain the cross, but he has never done so.
However, Mr. Astlej^ appears to be 011 the right road to success in this
direction for he writes that he has a male Psephotus multicolor paired to a
female P. hcematonotus. "The Many - colour," he says, "is frantically

At a recent meeting of the Zoological Society Dr. C. G. Steligmann,
the Society's pathologist, read his report on the deaths at the Gardens
during the past year which, so far as it relates to birds, is of considerably
interest to readers of this journal. Post mortem examinations have been
made on 21S birds in thirty-six of which no assignable cause of death was
to be found ; fifty-two had died of tuberculosis, eleven from enteritis and
forty-eight from injuries.

Sir, --I notice I am made to say I bred Mr. Fasey's Yellow-naped
hen. What I think I wrote was "which has bred," thus proving her sex.
I am afraid I hardly made it plain what I wanted to ask in my last
letter, viz. are the young Yellow-naped Parrakeets all hens which do not
show the red band over the bill and those showing the red cocks ? Is this
a sexual distinction in the young? F. H. Rudkin.
[It ts hoped that the observations of those members who possess
examples of this species will soon settle this question. Ed.]
Sir, --I bought a pair of Parrakeets as Barnards, but I rather think
from the description in your book that they are the Yellow-naped; they are
certainly a pair, but only the cock has a little red over the beak, the hen
has none, and is also rather smaller than the cock ; the cock also has some
slight splashes of red on the breast; their yellow collars are very broad and
distinct. They fly rapidly up and down a great deal, uttering a cry which
might be thought to resemble "twenty-eight." They seem very good-
tempered and are tyrannized over by an old Rosella, who, however, never
hurts anything, and I have had him with other birds in the open air for
about fifteen years. M. W. ConneeE.

qualus), several of which have lately arrived in this country. Ed.]

AVICULTURE AND SCIENCE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998855441860465" page_id="32720680"  page_num="241" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I have been much touched by my old friend Fillmer's affecting
remarks on this subject in the April number of the Magazine : it makes
one feel for poor Nebuchadnezzar when he failed to persuade the three
Hebrews to worship his gods or the golden image which he had set up;
it also reminds us of the children in the market - place who could not
persuade other children to take pleasure in their sports.
It is indeed news to me that the scientific aviculture which it was the
aim of the founders of our Society to inaugurate, was limited to the mere
use of correct nomenclature; I always thought it was intended to deal also
with the correct housing, culture, and study of our feathered brethren :
but, as I find it difficult to breed birds in cages, whereas my very good
friend Mr. Bonhote finds it easier to breed them that way than in aviaries ;
so also in the matter of feeding there are differences of opinion based upon
varied experience.
I find, in common with most aviculturists of tolerably wide exper-
ience, that 3&apos;olk of egg is an admirable food, and tends to keep birds in
health and vigour for a much longer time than when, in our early days of
bird-keeping, we rarely used it. When I first began my studies in bird-life,
I fed my insectivorous birds chiefly upon a combination of oatmeal and
peameal made into a paste; later I mixed scalded Spratt's poultry meal
(crushed dog-biscuit) with the other ingredients. O11 this I could keep
Blackbirds, Song- and Missel-Thrushes, and Starlings for two or three
years in moderately good health ; but then they had fits, cramp, skin
diseases, and they died. With plenty of yolk of egg, added to 'Century
Food,' biscuit, and bread, I can keep insectivorous birds practically until
they wear out from sheer old age.
In September 1905, I gave a list of my insectivorous birds with the
length of time for which (to my knowledge) they had been fed upon egg, in
the pages of the Feathered World, and Dr. Creswell tried to make light of
the undeniable facts there brought forward, by speaking of these birds as
survivals, and arguing that they lived in spite of the improper food. Of
course Dr. Creswell made no enquiries which could justify this assumption,
had he done so, I could have told him that my birds were indeed survivals,
owing to the fact that they had been fed with egg. My Blue-bearded Jay is
one of seven imported at the same time, and the only one which survived,
the others had meat, but little or no egg: I forget how many Collared Jay-
Thrushes came with mine, but only mine lived. My Chinese Bulbul was
one of two, the other specimen died in less than a month. All the Bower-
birds bought with my pair died young, and all the Scarlet Tanagers which
came over with mine have long since departed this life.
My insectivorous birds are therefore correctly styled survivors, and
they are by far the greater part of the birds of this class which I have
owned during the past ten years or so; those which have died were, almost

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
without exception, in desperate case when they came into my possession,
and even these were few in number.
The importance of Dr. Creswell's conclusions respecting fresh air will
be admitted by all who know anything about bird-life: some aviculturists
will not go so far as he does ; though, years before he published his long
paper on hygiene, I had shown that even delicate Waxbills could stand a
considerable amount of cold with impunity, so long as they had plenty of
fresh air (I remember that my Avadavats were none the worse for 21 degrees
of frost). I11 fact the so-called discoveries of Dr. Creswell did not strike
aii3 7 old hands as new; but when I stated as much, he said that this was
"very interesting" and desired me to point out chapter and verse: my
memory is perhaps unusually good (I have been told so), but I was never
good at dates ; however I think Mr. Fulljames later called attention to the
fact that Dr. Greene had made a stir about the latent potentiality for
mischief in yolk of egg when given to unhealthy birds, in the Feathered
World years before. I know that about the same time a Canary-breeder
argued the point with me in my bird-room, and assured me that he reared
all his young on sopped bread alone.
In short most of what these modern explorers have discovered is not
new; and, of the residuum, the onus of proving that it is true they are
welcome to. It is certainly not true that Messrs. Creswell and Fillmer are
"the two best hated men in the world of aviculture"; even the least for-
giving students of bird-life do not regard the matter seriously enough for
that; and, although they may deplore the lack of courtesy which has
characterized the letters published by the egg traducers, they excuse the
naughtiness on the ground of zeal for a hopeless cause.
A. G. Butler.
Sir, --With reference to Mr. Fillmer's letter in the April Magazine,
may I be allowed to point out:
(1) That the fact of fresh air being of more importance than heat has
been known to aviculturists long before the name of Dr. Creswell. In
proof of this one has only to refer back to the early volumes of the
Avicultmal Magazine and read the records of Messrs. John Sargeant, W. T.
Page, and the Rev. C. D. Farrar, besides several others, all of whom had
published their records of these facts long before Dr. Creswell.
(2) That egg-food had been denounced first of all by Gedney, (but I
have not got the book here to give reference), at any rate by Dr. Greene,
who wrote in Bird Notes, Vol. III., p. 166, that he had written about it in
the first volume of Poultry, which is certainly a long time ahead of Dr.
Creswell, and in spite of all denunciations it still continues to be used by
the great majority of bird-keepers. Further, I am open to state that, if Dr.
Creswell or Mr. Fillmer asked each member of the Foreign Bird Club
whether they used egg in any shape or form, more than half would

reply in the affirmative, and this after nearly three years of the " Story of
Bird-Death."
While on this subiect, one is tempted to ask whj&apos; were Dr. Creswell
and the " 110-eggers," (to coin a word), so down on Mr. Finn for recommend-
ing egg for rearing the nestlings of the Java Sparrow etc. (see Bird Notes,
Vol. IV.) and in the same volume, page 3, Mr. Castle-Sloane says he feeds
his Choughs on hard-boiled egg yet, according to Dr. Creswell, it is equally
bad for all birds.
In reply to Mr. Fillmer's kind remarks about myself, may I say that
I asked " the gentleman then officially connected with Bird Notes," to
write, stating that I was perfectly willing to reply to Dr. Creswelhs remarks
provided that I could do so under the name of " Onlooker," and I also told
him, although I do not know if he wrote to that effect, that if Dr. Creswell
did not care to publish my reply in Bird Notes I would send it to the
Avicultural Magazine. This is, I suppose, the threat that was held out
that capital would be made out of it if he refused.
Further, I entirely fail to see why, if Dr. Creswell was not satisfied
with my criticisms of " The Wild Canary," he could not write himself; he
can, as most of his readers know, wield a trenchant pen, and has had plenty
of time to go into the alleged errors in his paper.
If Dr. Creswell likes, I shall be only too pleased to write a criticism
of his " Bibliograph}&apos; of Cage Birds," pointing out a few omissions and a
fair number of mistakes, either in Bitd Notes or this journal, but would
require a fair amount of space as they are rather numerous. At the same
time it is extremely creditable to him, when one recollects that less than
four 3 T ears ago (August 1902) he wrote, "/ have never had access to good or
rather full books on my favourite hobby " ; and this I can quite believe
after reading the Bibliography through. " Onlooker."

most tame bird and will feed from my hands or lips and will come to a

removed every other bird out of the aviary and I think I shall just let her
do as she chooses, but I cannot see how she can incubate the clutch of eggs

Sir, --Many of the readers of the Avicultural Magazine will no doubt
have shared my pleasure in reading the very interesting contribution to the
discusssion of Aviaries ami Cages by Mr. C. William Beebe, published in
the April number of the Magazine.
Mr. Beebe reveals himself as a true lover of birds, and as such I
should like to shake hands with him across the Atlantic, although we may
differ 011 some details about the best management of birds in confinement.
Nothing in this world is perfect, and when I read in a publication
accessible to all the world that it was asserted the new Bird-house at the
New York Zoological Gardens " excels most other buildings of its kind in
the world," and had reason to believe that its model might be copied tel
quel in Europe, I ventured to suggest, in my article in the January number
of the Aviadtural Magazine, that it would be well " before copying it, to
wait a couple of years and to ascertain whether it has fulfilled the hopes of
its designers." My criticism of details was] meant in all kindness, and I
entirely dissociate myself from other writers who called the New York
house " a grotesque experiment" etc. I wished to point out that many of
the weak points in a new structure only become apparent after a while.
Mr. Beebe frankly admits that he had a great struggle with the
plague of mice, as I had foreseen he would have. He thinks that 11 Homo
sapiens " has beaten " Mus americanus" and driven the latter out of the
bird-house. His account of the means he employed is interesting, but I
fear the slim mouse will beat the brain of man in his case, glad as I am to
recognise Mr. Beebe's resourcefulness in fighting a difficulty.
Complete extermination is impossible, and as each pair of mice will
be responsible for a numerous swarm in a very short time the mouse war,
which Mr. Beebe thinks ended, will recommence periodical!} 7 . The worst is

mice will find other places for making new holes. I found that only floors
of the hardest cement or of tiles will be proof against mouse holes. Traps
are of very little use when there is so much, and such a variety of, food
about as there is in an aviary.
The idea of Sparrow-Hawks hunting for mice by moonlight seems
quite picturesque until we think of the poor Weaver-birds in the adjoining
cage, who must have spent terrible nights, when they were separated from
these mortal combats only by a wire partition.
The use of terriers I have tried many years ago, but not without
danger. I had a very small wiry-haired female terrier of extraordinary
intelligence and docility. The birds did not mind her in the least, and I
would have bet anything that she would never touch a bird. She used to
scent any stray mouse in a pot in which was planted a shrub, and then a
can of water soon drove out the drenched intruder, who was easily killed iu
that state. All went well until one day I was catching the first brood of
Parrot-finches ever reared in captivity, and of which I was very proud.
The opportunity seemed good to let doggie scent around before the parent
Parrot-finches began to nest again, when, during a moment's absence my
reliable terrier killed my treasured young birds. The accident was quite
inexplicable until the day after when the terrier gave birth to a solitar3 r
puppy which explained the occurrence and saved the poor terrier from
being shot, as had been decided upon.
An account of this mishap was published by the late Dr. Karl Russ
in the 1S79 edition of his book on exotic finches [Die Prachtfinken).
It would appear to me that to let dogs dig up mice from the roots of
plants would not fail to be pernicious to the plants.
If mice are prevented from overrunning plants in an aviary from
below, they will not fail to climb up woodwork or wires and get at the
plants from above, iu trying to do which I have seen them make surprising
leaps.
Frequent judicious and scientific spraying has overcome the difficulty
of the leaves of plants becoming covered with dust in the New York bird-
house. How this is done so effectually with plants reaching the roof of a
house 36 feet high, and accomplished without flooding the cages, would be
interesting to hear in detail.
To cover the panes of a glass roof with a film of white paint in sum-
mer, and thereby somewhat reduce the extreme effect of the midsummer
sun's rays, is a very ancient device. It always seemed to me a rather crude
makeshift, and that modern architects should be able to devise something
better. A combination of sunblinds and Louvre ventilators can keep the
glass much cooler.
At horticultural shows I have seen, of late years, many sorts of
excellent blinds which shade the glass without seusiblj^ diminishing the
light, and these are much more effective than covering panes of glass with
paint liable to be washed off by a couple of thunderstorms.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
I may state that I have had opportunities to see Parrots in the wild
state for, during an extended journey in Brazil, I had the good fortune to
traverse at leisure considerable districts of cultivated, semi-cultivated, and
uncultivated country, with nothing else to do than to use my eyes and to
observe what objects of interest turned up.
As regards the number of species of Parrots, I have read some years
ago that it was estimated at Soo, and that frequent additions were being
made. I do not remember the title of the book, but I still believe that
when I wrote that " I thought the known species of Parrots numbered
nearer 1,000 than 500 " I was not far wrong.*
If we remember that the first mention of Parrots in history occurs in
the early years of the Christian era, that in 1820 only 158 species were
known, in 1832 179, in 1S67 350, and considering the progress of travel and
scientific research since that time, my estimate may not be far wrong when
I ventured to write that 1,000 species may exist, though 575 are enumerated
in a recent work on Parrots. Every ardent collector comes not un-
frequeutly across new species unknown to Museums, and the compilers
of Museum catalogues are often not too sure whether a new skin
should be declared an accidental variation of plumage, a local variety, or a
new species, and I think no Museum pretends to have a specimen skin of
every kind of Parrot in this wide world of ours.
It is gratifying to hear that on the whole Mr. Beebe seems satisfied
with the state of health and the rate of mortality of his birds during the
first year's residence in his new Bird-house.
Far from wishing to be a sceptic, I would however remind him that
the result of one cycle of seasons is not conclusive. The second j&apos;ear
reveals the real difficulties. I have seen tropical birds who survived one
winter's open air treatment apparently surprisingly well, but who had no
stamina left afterwards. And another point is that any change acts as a
stimulant. I11 the seventies I was induced to exhibit a large collection of
many delicate and valuable small foreign finches. I thought that I was
risking the life of a good many, but to my great surprise not one died, and
all came back to my aviary as much refreshed and benefited as a human
being is who leaves, in the holiday season, a comfortable house and home to
spend some time in hot stuffy railroad cars and in hotels less comfortable
than his own home. Some such stimulus birds feel when they&apos; first come
from a cage into an aviary, but the effect is not invariably so lasting as we
expect it to be.
And now I come to a very interesting part of Mr. Beebe's letter, in
which he states that the American public pass by separate cages containing
but a single specimen or species, and are most attracted by collections
of larger numbers. That I can well believe, and it is a matter which Mr.
Beebe must doubtless consider. But I fancy that elsewhere the case is
About 600 species of Parrots are known. Ed.

somewhat different. We all know that life in America, and especially in
New York, is mueli more strenuous than it is in Europe. The American
public want to see as much as possible in a short time, either owing to
lack of time or to the habit of doing most things more quickly and on a
bigger scale. We in Europe are habitually less in a hurry, and more in-
terested in details than in the admiration of huge numbers.
I think that very many more people in Europe have kept some birds
themselves, at some time in their life, than is the custom in America.
The public here in London is coming to the Zoological Gardens not
once but again and again, very many come many times every summer,
some once a month or every fortnight or week, with no other attraction
and purpose than to look at the animals, and visitors of this sort want to
see their favourites individually 7 , and take a personal interest in those
they prefer.
People who have kept or are keeping birds constitute a considerable
proportion of the visitors, and they wish to see the animals they best know
and are eager to learn something new about their rational treatment.
Cage-birds have always been, and always will be, favourite pets of
many 7 European households. It is a well known fact that foreign finches
become much more easily used to cage life than indigenous finches, but
owing to ignorance of suitable feeding or defective housing few private
persons succeed in keeping these pretty creatures as successfully as they
might be kept. It seems to me that the province of a Zoological Garden is
to disseminate and popularise practical knowledge as to how to keep birds,
and to interest the public in the means of doing so.
Not one in a thousand people who visit a Zoological Garden can
afford a garden aviary, but hundreds have tried or would try to keep a pair
of birds to brighten their homes. For this purpose the foreign finches, and
especially 7 the smaller waxbills, are more suited than any other birds ; and
it is just these that have been unaccountably neglected in the London Zoo.
in the past. They 7 are easy to keep when housed in suitably constructed
cages and tended with intelligent and thoughtful care. But such cages are
not easily obtained because for want of a model they are not made whole-
sale, though they might easily be made cheaply enough.
Scarcely is the plan mooted to build at last a new house for small
foreign birds, when claims are put forward that the small birds should be
housed in large flight aviaries in a state similar to " natural conditions." I
assert that they are not natural conditions when we confine a number
of birds of many kinds in one enclosure, make them hop about, live
and sleep 011 the same little tree, and eat out of the same food dish. Birds
do not do that in nature and they cannot and do not thrive under such
conditions. The weaker ones soon end a miserable worried existence.
Few persons who have not studied them closely have any idea of the
great beauty and wonderful gracefulness of the small waxbills, some of

which are even smaller than the Humming-bird lately exhibited, and much
more graceful in their movements. In asserting this I am thinking of the
African Estrelda minima, of smaller Orange-cheek Waxbills and others.
These small tropical finches are erroneously supposed to be sougless,
and so they are when they sit lifeless and puffy because terrorised in a large
aviary.* But when kept in pairs and suitably tended they are pictures of
health and agility and have each their own little expressive song. I lost
quite lately, from sheer old age, a pair of small Amaduvade Finches, and
quite miss the sweet peculiar little song of the male with which he enter-
tained his wife many times a day.
The vSt. Helena Waxbill, with its sober grayish brown plumage and a
slight tinge of crimson on the lower part, looks an insignificant little bird
in an aviary, but when we look at a healthy specimen closely, we see the
brown plumage delicately pencilled with wave-like markings and the
crimson hue of the breast becomes very beautiful.
My Paradise Whydah sings to me for hours together, seems to have
endless chatter in a peculiar note which pleases without ever fatiguing the
listener. That these birds, when visiting the sand on the bottom of their
cages, sometimes run and scratch like a hen and carry their tail so that the
tips are just above the sand few would ever see in an aviary, nor could any-
body watch the marvellous transformation which takes place when the
annual change of colour occurs, when a sober grey is transformed into rich
black and when a tail ten to twelve inches long grows in less than a month
at the rate of about half an inch per day.
My idea of a house for small foreign birds is and remains, that it
should be primarily devoted to the Finches and &apos;Waxbills. I should like to
see these shown in rows of roomy cages, intended to be models of comfort
for the birds, and such au exhibition should be arranged with some attempt
at classification and system, whilst now limited space brings strange and
incongruous fellows of captivity to the same food dish.
A row of cages showing in one the Calcutta species of Amaduvade
Finches, in the next the Madras kind and then the Japanese variety and the
slightly larger green Indian kind of the same family would make a beautiful
object of exhibition. If, instead of having a dozen of the small Biclieno's
or Double-banded Australian Finches sitting lifeless in one row L in a Parrot
cage, one pair were housed in a proper cage, these little beauties would look
very different and a row of representative pairs of the many beautiful
species of Australian Finches would surprise the beholders, and I go a
step further and would like to see a pair of Siberian or Himalayan Gold-
finches shown side by side with a pair of their European cousins for
comparison.
* We have often noticed that small foreign birds which have never been heard to
sing when caged have immediately commenced to do so, and to show every sign of perfect
happiness, when liberated into a large aviary even when the latter has contained many
other birds of varying sizes. Ed.

The same thing might be done with the gorgeous American Nonpareil,
who should be flanked with his European near relative the Chaffinch and
his cousin from Java, the Pintailed Nonpareil.* The latter is in colour
similar to the American Nonpareil, but in other respects allied to the
Parrot Finches, a specimen of which should not be absent.
Another very interesting exhibit might be arranged by showing, side
by side, the various African Green Seedeaters, the Wild Canary from
Teneriffe and Madeira, the Cape Canary and all the finches which may have
had something to do with the origin of our European household friend, the
Yellow Canary, whose ancestors were green like a Greenfinch or a Siskin.
A row of cages showing the Robins of various countries would be
very interesting, and if space admitted at any time, a row of cages showing
the varieties of exotic small Doves, or the varieties of Thrushes, or at
another time the Starlings might make very interesting and instructive
exhibits, prior to being turned into flight aviaries as room admitted.
I know from experience that those who look for rare or new birds can
find in London a surprising variety in the course of a year or two. In
former times, when I was an active collector, a weekly or fortnightly visit
to the chief dealers proved sufficient to enable me to obtain possession of
almost every known species of small foreign cage-bird at one time or
another, and of some previously unknown species also. Very rarely were
birds worth having offered to me by letter.
I11 the past the Zoological Gardens were stocked by birds presented
or brought there for sale, and the new arrivals were housed without any
attempt at classification. Anyone interested in any particular bird will not
find it easy to ascertain whether it exists in the collection unless he happens
to be possessed of the exact name under which it has been registered, and
then to find the bird is another and more difficult matter. The Western
Aviary contains a great number of highly interesting and some very good
and rare birds, of which very few visitors ever see anything. Take the
family of Tanagers, as an example, which contains some of the most
beautiful birds known. They do not come outside even for mealworms,
and privileged visitors who gain access to the interior of the aviary will find
these birds retired to the dark unventilated backroom. Their presence
during life is but little known to the public, their death is not noticed by
the visitors, and the prime cost of those which have been purchased has
really been money more or less wasted. In these aviaries these gorgeous
birds live but a short time, whilst I have known them to live for many
years in separate cages, and to delight, during their life, their owners and
very many friends and admirers.
Occasionally the cost of labour for cleaning separate cages and pay-
ing individual attention to the birds has been mentioned as an argument in
* The American Nonpareil Bunting- is in no way related to the Pintailed Nonpareil

favour of aviaries. Such an argument appears to me inadmissible. Any-
body who loves birds, and who has his heart in his work and his object,
can look after a very great number of cages, and unless we chose to give
wholehearted attention to our captives personally&apos;, or to find others who do
so for us without for ever weighing the trouble which is involved by
attention to this or that detail, we should not keep any birds or any&apos; captive
animals at all. Aug.. F. Wiener.
PRIVATE ADVERTISEMENTS.
Sir, --The idea put forward in the April number of the Magazine
that private advertisements should be accepted up to the 26th of each

extra expense. Nicholas S. O'Reiiay.

There are a great many, the majority in fact, of our members who
rarely, if ever, contribute papers for publication in our journal, although
they have probably kept and studied birds for years and must have made
many interesting observations on their habits. We should like to impress
upon these members that it is not necessary&quot;, as some seem to imagine,
to wait until they have accomplished some great feat in aviculture,
such as breeding a very rare species, before writing for our pages. All
interesting facts connected with birds should be recorded ; and no
member need be shy of writing.
Many of our members take photographs of birds, nests, or aviaries,
and the Editor will always be glad to receive such with a view to their
reproduction.
There are other ways also in which members can help the Society&apos;and
its Magazine, one of the chief of which is to induce other bird-lovers to
join our ranks, for the larger the membership the better will be the
Magazine that we give them month by month, and in order to help forward
the Society in this direction it has been decided to present each member,
other than an officer of the Society, who shall propose two candidates for
election, with a bound volume of the Avictdtural Magazine, which shall be
sent as soon as the candidates have been elected and paid their fees. Both
candidates need not be proposed in the same month, the offer remains open
until the 31st of December next. If four candidates should be proposed by
the same member two volumes will be presented to him. The volumes can
be selected from Vols. 2, 5, 6 or 7 of the First Series.
Finally we would remind our members that the Illustration Fund
which was started some time ago is still open, and donations will be most
thankfully received by the Honorary&apos; Secretary. We have, at the present
time, to acknowledge with many thanks a donation of #2 to this fund from
Mr. L. W. Horton.

Calopclia puella.
By Arthur G. Butler, Pli.D.
This beautiful African Bronzewing was first described by
Schlegel in 1848; and, on that account doubtless, the list of the
animals in the Zoological Society's Gardens gives to it the trivial
name of ' Schlegel's Dove' : it is however usual to apply a name
of this character to species described in honour of naturalists or
others, as an English equivalent of the specific denomination.
The only Dove named in honour of Schlegel is a Bronzewing
from New Guinea and Papua --Hetiicophaps albifrons, described
by G. R. Gray in 1861 and renamed Rfhjynchoenas schlegeli in the
year following: I have therefore adopted the German trivial
name for the present species.
Dr. Russ in his " Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel " (vol. II,
p. 791) makes the following remarks:--" This very beautiful and
stately dove is an inhabitant of West Africa and lives in the
bush. In the year 1870 it first arrived at the Eondon Zoological
Gardens and afterwards at the Amsterdam Gardens in the year
1884. The same year the wholesale dealer W. Cross of Liverpool
sent me two doves which from the first proved tame, confiding
and peaceable in the bird room. Then in the year 1S88 Miss
Chr. Hagenbeck of Hamburg had two doves of this species at
the exhibition of the"Ornis" Society, and subsequently it has
been imported several times with us, but has not yet been bred."
With the beautiful plate before us, it is unnecessary to
describe this dove here, but it may be as well to note that the
metallic spots on the inner greater wing-coverts and largest

Dr. A. G. Butlkr,
scapulars more often than not appear of a fiery copper colour in
the living bird, the golden green lustre being only occasionally
visible. The female is perhaps a trifle smaller than the male, has
a rather less prominent forehead and is much less alert and
heavier in her movements: when the two sexes are seen together
one has no hesitation whatever in fixing upon the cock bird. An
immature bird described by Captain Shelley in 1883 ( Ibis p. 322)
exhibited the black bars on the scapulars, wing - coverts, and
secondaries, with which all breeders are familiar in the young
of the Columba.
In 1904 ( Ibis p. 95) Dr. Sharpe calls attention to the fact
that Brehmer's Dove ( Calopelia brchmeri ) inhabits the same
country as C. puella , and suggests that it may be the young of
the latter species : on the other hand, as the character noted by
Salvadori " only differs in the metallic spot on the wings being
of a golden coppery, with occasionally a slight green reflection "
fits in exactly with all the fully adult living specimens which
I have seen ; and as Captain Shelley considers that the two
are not specifically different, and moreover has noted the barred
character of the young in C. puella, it seems far more probable
that, as with other Bronzewings, the metallic markings vary in
individuals. Nevertheless, as C. brehmeri in its total length is
described as considerably smaller than C. puella (a measurement
which one can hardly consider satisfactory when one notes that
the wing is of the same length and the tail only one tenth of an
inch shorter) and that the soft parts differ considerably in colour,
one must either assume that, as is frequently the case, the soft
parts have been incorrectly described by the collectors, and
the taxidermist has produced the difference in length of skins;
or that the two are subspecifically (perhaps locally) distinct, as
has been supposed in the case of the nearly-related Emerald
Doves ( Chalcopelia afra and C. chalcospilos ) in which the soft
parts undoubtedly differ remarkably.*
Although I have been unsuccessful in collating any notes
on the wild life of the Maiden Dove, there is no reason for
* Ill the Museum Catalogue C. chalcospilos is described as the female of C. afra and
*certainly the only example which I possess that has laid eggs is of the green-spotted type,
*whereas the blue-spotted form undoubtedly coos, but both sexes do this.

supposing that it would differ greatly from that of the Emerald
Dove, of which Von Heuglin writes :--"The pairing takes place
at the commencement of the rainy season, now one hears the
loud and flute-like cry, in other respects by far the most
extraordinary, which the males utter from the dry branch of a
thorn-tree. It sounds like duu-duu-duu-du-du-du-du and seems
at one time quite close and then to come from a great distance.
The nest is placed upon dwarf Acacias or Zizyphus bushes fre-
quently only a few feet above the ground, and both near to the
trunk and in the outermost horizontal branches. It is con-
structed of twigs, just as slightly as those of the other Doves,
and contains two small yellowish white eggs. Vierthaler dis-
covered a nest in the hollow of a tree-trunk which had been
broken off."
In 1905 Mr. Hamlyn imported nearly a dozen examples of
Cptiella and our member Mr. Housden being struck with their
beauty brought a very perfect pair home and showed them to
me : I purchased that pair and turned them out into one of my
aviaries ; Mr. Housden then bought a second pair for himself,
and I believe our Editor secured others. Although, as Russ
observes, the Maiden Dove is passably tame and not in the least
degree quarrelsome, it is undoubtedly about the most delicate of
all the Columbce. I purchased my pair on the 6th of September,
the female was taken ill in November and died before the end of
the year; I believe Mr. Housden had similar ill-luck with his,
and Mr. Seth-Smith was equally unfortunate. If these birds
could be imported early in the year, and turned into an outdoor
aviary for the summer and autumn, I feel satisfied that we should
get much better results; it is hard upon any birds to import them
in the autumn, and particularly such an autumn as we had in
1905 when the night-frosts began in September.
Up to the date of its partner's death my cock bird had
never uttered a note ; but it was only about three days later that
I saw him on a branch quivering his half opened wings and
cooing away most vigorously : this was almost like adding insult
to injury, making one regret all the more the death of the
female. The songs of C. puella, C. afra , and T. tympanistria are
all remarkably similar, which is I think clear evidence of the

near relationship of the three species; that they have auy right
to be placed in three different genera I don't believe for a
moment, nor do I think, that the dissimilar ground-colouring of
the three ought to be considered in a generic diagnosis. The
song of Tympanistria is far more prolonged, as a general rule,
than that of the two others ; but they all sing in the same fashion
-- Hoo -- hoo--hoo -- hoo slowly and emphatically, then rapidly ;
but I have only heard Tympanistria finish by running all the end
notes together with a sort of guttural rattle.
Unlike the Australian Bronzewings which spend much
time on the earth, and which certainly have a far higher claim to
the term Ground-Doves than the Zenaidince , which rarely come
down excepting to feed ; these African doves spend most of their
time either on a branch or on the wing. If the hen descends to
the earth to eat or drink, the cock will follow and wander about
after her, sometimes stopping to utter his remarkable song and
then at the conclusion racing after his mate, which more fre-
quently than not immediately flies to a branch.
Unlike the Australian Bronzewings, probably because of
the comparatively inconspicuous character of the metallic
patches, these African birds do not elevate their wings in front
of the expanded tail when courting, but merely slightly open and
quiver them ; the tail remains depressed, but the head is slightly
bent forward and the throat and chest expanded much as in the
illustration of Leptoptilajamaicensis in last year's Magazine ; but
with a deeper stoop forwards, and the wings generally rather
more open.

In 1902, in the April May and June numbers of the
Avicultural Magazine, I gave an account, which was accom-
panied by a coloured plate, of a pair of immature Bee-eaters,
Merops apiaster, that had come into my possession on September
20 of the previous year. The male died in the early morning of
May 17, 1905, having lived in captivity about three years and ten
months, and in my possession nearly three years and eight
months, a remarkable record when one considers that he had
passed his little life in London where natural food, except spas-
modically, was unobtainable, and where light, without plenty of
which he could not see to feed, is at a minimum during four or
five months out of every twelve.
The bird died from some form of tubercle or wasting of
the intestines, probably caused by an insufficiency of natural
food, or possibly from something he had swallowed, as he would
gulp down almost anything that was large enough to be man-
dibulated by the bill of a Bee-eater and small enough to pass
down his gullet. The female, on the contrary, was always a very
shy feeder, and never suffered in this way. Perhaps during the
dark winter months I too often favoured her when I lighted on a
tit-bit--to the detriment of the male.
The deceased bird was always slim active and talkative,
and by day or night would call eagerly to me whenever he heard
my footsteps; and I was slow to perceive that he was seriously
ill; but his calls became so urgent, and he would dash against
the wires of his six-foot cage in his endeavours to get to me if I
did not immediately open the door, and then would follow me
about with such persistence that at length I became aware that
he was appealing to me for help, and was following me in the
hopes that I might give him relief. This is one of the saddest
and most pathetic things in connection with making pets of
birds--they think we can do everything for them, they look upon
us as their god, when so often one is absolutely powerless to give
them the assistance for which they crave.
On the night of May 16, the male left or fell from his

Mr. Reginald Phileipps,
perch and squatted down in a quiet spot where, towards mid-
night, I found him, and knew he had retired thither to die ; and
there in the morning I found the still squatting but lifeless body.
During the day following, the poor little widow would go to this
spot where last she had seen her squatting mate and wonderingly
examine it, and puzzle her brain as to what could have become
of her fellow from whom she had never before been separated.
For nearly four years these two had nestled and cuddled
together side by side every night, and, if either fell, they knew
they had but to call out and the missing one would be picked up
and restored to its place, when they would instantly sidle up to
one another and utter a few crooning notes of entire content-
ment and satisfaction. Continuously for some hours during the
night following the death of the male, the female, usually a very
quiet undemonstrative bird, called and called and called again,
and was filled with a strange wonder at my denseness in failing
to see that the male was missing from her side, and intreated me
to pick him up and restore him to his accustomed place and to
her. And for long afterwards she continued to be alert and
watchful and to call out, as if still on the look out for her life-
long companion.
The eyes of the two Bee-eaters, nearly four years old,
retained the dark brown colour of their youth to the last. In
their first spring the irides of the male (VIII., p. 106) at any
rate, perhaps of both, shewed distinct traces of yellow ; but, pre-
sumably owing to the want of the brilliant Mediterranean and
African sun, every tinge of red or yellow disappeared and never
was detected again. I have noticed the same phenomenon in
some other species.
At the time of the death of the male, the plumage of the
two birds was much alike save on the forehead and sinciput
generally, the forehead of the male being of a brilliant yellow
merging into green (not a trace of white), that of the female
(including superciliaries) being green and devoid of any appear-
ance of yellow. Sometimes the female has shewn a little yellow ;
but there has always been a marked difference here between the
two, by which the male could be distinguished from the female
at a glance. One feels that in the wild bird a similar if not

identical difference should be observable. The male generally
was a more brilliantly coloured bird, besides being larger and
more solid, and incomparably more talkative and assertive; and
being less fidgety and nervous he kept his flights and tail in very
fair condition. I11 other respects, the plumage of both was
usually in excellent order.
How Dresser and other writers can refer to the notes of
the Bee-eater as being harsh is beyond my comprehension;
manifestly they are totally unacquainted with the song and
home-talk of the species (VIII. pp. 154-5). Those who have no
knowledge of the subject beyond the alarm-call uttered at the
time when these beautiful and most useful creatures are being
butchered are hardly in a position, one feels, to offer an opinion
on the point. The most sweet-voiced Siren that ever was born
might possibly utter a discordant squeal or two were she to find
herself being peppered with small shot in order that her tresses
might be shorn off and exhibited for sale in some fashionable
shop, or on finding herself netted by murderous cannibals as she
came out of her house-door, and with her last sense feeling that
her babes were being left to starvation or to worse. Save, locally,
in the matter of bees, the Bee-eater is one of the most useful
(p. 106) and beautiful of God's Glorious Creation.
The bill of the deceased male, from the gape, was just
under two inches in length. Occasionally the upper mandible
of both birds has been longer ; but on some two or three occa-
sions I have had to shorten them as the over-lengthened upper
mandibles hindered the birds when trying to pick up food. In
the wild state, burrowing work would have worn down the
mandibles to a suitable length.
As month succeeded month my two Bee-eaters, little by
little, lost the hereditary and instinctive habit of banging their
bills against the perches in order to kill imaginary wasps and
bees. On the other hand, they learned to drink and wash their
faces freely, almost frequently (but only in a glass suspended
near a perch, never on the ground)--so surely do the habits of
birds become modified and (within limits) adapted to their
surroundings.

Being sound and healthy, I had hoped that the female
might survive for many a day, but it was not to be.
" I have marked it well, it must be true,
Death never takes one alone, but two ;
Whenever he enters in at the door--
Be it palace of gold or cottage of thatch--
When going he leaves the door on the latch,
And conies again ere the year be o'er."
I quote from memory, but to that effect wrote Longfellow. I am
not one of those who believe that a cast horse-shoe, the spilling
of salt, the walking under a ladder (if there be no fellow on it to
drop brickbats or water on to one's head) have greater powers in
the world than the world's Creator, so will confine the application
to the poor Bee-eaters, for five weeks and one day later I was
likewise mourning over the dead body of the female; and this is
how it happened.
During the long dark days of winter, she had battered
about a good deal, not being able to see clearly (p. 130), and had
broken the ends of most of her primaries, and thus was feeble
of flight. Being much more nervous than the male, she always
fared worse in this way than he did. They were as tame as
kittens; and on warm dry days I would carry them in my arms
like a couple of kittens and place them in the aviary for change
of air and scene. On June 22 last she was thus in the garden.
Mrs. Phillipps had been reading there, and when she came in
had left the Bee-eater comfortably perched upon a branch some
few feet off the ground and not many from the larger birds'
washing pan. About an hour later I went into the aviary to
carry her off to bed, and found her drowned in the pan. She
had evidently fluttered down from her perch and by an evil
chance doused into the water. From the state of the water and
around the pan she had evidently made a tremendous fight for
life, for she was no weakling ; but the legs of this species are
peculiarly short and feeble and she had not a chance, and there
was no one to help for I was not at my post.
Thus within six weeks I lost my two Bee-eaters, the most
troublesome but the most dear to me of all the birds. They were
so confiding, and trusted me so absolutely, and looked to me for

everything--it is long since I felt the loss of a pet so deeply as I
have felt the loss of these two helpless tots.
And, in conclusion, I must be permitted to express a hope
that I shall never again see a Bee-eater in confinement. May
the Bee-eaters be left alone in their natural haunts, and be neither
heartlessly butchered to pander to the vanity of empty-minded
women, nor slaughtered because they kill bees, for they do far
more good than harm, nor brought into captivity as they are not
suitable for cage life, although so admirably adapted for fulfilling
the mission for which they were created--that of making the
world in hot latitudes where noxious insects abound more habit-
able for man who, in this connection, notwithstanding his vaunted
superiority, is in reality such a miserably helpless being.

ECLIPSE PLUMAGE AND FLIGHTLESSNESS.

By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The interesting problems connected with the assumption
of the undress or "eclipse" plumage in some of the duck family,
and the question as to which waterfowl become flightless when
moulting, have been recently under discussion in the Field,
and as the matter is one of much interest for aviculturists,
I should like to offer a few remarks on this subject, having
always paid particular attention to waterfowl, and not to British
species only, to which most observations seem to have been
confined.
With regard to the eclipse plumage of the Pochard, I
recorded the existence of such a phase as long ago as 1901, in
my pamphlet "How to know the Indian Ducks," where I said
"the male in undress retains much of his full colour, merely
getting a browner head, a dark pencilled grey breast and duller
tail-coverts." I have observed this change in many specimens,
in Europe as well as in India, and also that a similar one occurs
in the very nearly allied American Pochard or Redhead ( Nyi&apos;oca
americana ) of which a few were recently on view at the Zoo.
In the case of the White-eyed Pochard, however, I have
never seen any assumption of eclipse plumage by the male,

Mr. Frank Finn,
though I observed specimens for years in India; in Europe the
bird seems to be rare in captivity nowadays ; at any rate I have
never seen a live bird over here.
More remarkable is the case of the South-American Rosj r -
billed Pochard (Metopiana peposaca), well-known to amateurs of
ornamental waterfowl ; in this species there is a very great
sexual difference, but no eclipse plumage is assumed by the
male, as I have often had opportunities of observing in the
Zoological Gardens. In these Gardens there was recently a
remarkable hybrid between this species and the Red-crested
Pochard. The bird was a male, and had all the appearance of a
distinct and independent form ; it closely resembled the Rosy-
billed species in coloration except in having black under tail-
coverts, but had fuller head-feathering and no frontal knob ; the
bill was pink. In summer it went into a brown eclipse plumage,
thus agreeing with its Red - crested parent, which has a very
complete eclipse. There are, at the time of writing this, three
specimens of this cross with Mrs. Hamlyn, of 221, St. George's
Street East, two of them males, and exactly like the bird above
referred to, and one female with the same plumage as this bore
when in undress.
I may also mention that hybrids between the common
tame duck and the Muscovy, when they happen to show any
resemblance to the Mallard in colour (often, of course, being
domestic birds, they are abnormally plumaged) undergo an
eclipse change like that bird, although no such eclipse occurs in
the Muscovy, which has naturally the sexes alike in plumage.
It is noteworthy that that member of the Anatidce in
which the sexual difference is most conspicuous--the Mandarin
Duck (Aixgalericulatci)-- also displays the closest approximation
to the female attire when in eclipse ; but no significance can be
attached to this fact when it is remembered that the only near
ally of this species, the Carolina or Summer Duck (A. spo?isa )
has an eclipse plumage noticeably different from the female dress
-- which peculiar feathering also characterizes the young drakes
of the year.
A very curious phenomenon is presented by Baer's
Pochard (Nyroca baeri). In this species there is no plumage-

difference between males and fine females (some specimens of
the latter sex are much duller than others) except for a rusty
patch on the lores; and in eclipse plumage the male acquires
this, the only change he can make !
As far as I have been able to observe Australian and South.
American Anatidce have no eclipse plumage, whether there is a
well-marked sexual difference, as in the above-mentioned Rosy-
billed Pochard and in the Maned Goose (Chenonetta jubata ) of
Australia, or whether both sexes bear a handsome quasi-male
plumage, such as the Chilian Wigeon (.Mareca chiloensis ) or the
Grey Teal {Querqiiediila veisicolor). The latter case is obviously
like that of the Sheldrakes, which everywhere and always display
a striking plumage. These, being powerful intelligent birds,,
probably need protection less than the other ducks, and it is to be
noted, with regard to the South-American and Australian Water-
fowl, that they inhabit a region where the survival of numerous
primitive types is supposed to show that the struggle for life is
less keen. This would of course, be an argument in favour of
the eclipse plumage as a protective one. Whatever its use may
be, there is some foundation for Mr. Bonhote's idea that it is a
weak phase, in so far as it is a reversion to a more primitive
colour.
Some birds in captivity will thus go into an abnormal
eclipse, losing the distinctive male coloration to a great extent--
a phenomenon very familiar in such finches as the Linnet, which
loses its carmine colouring and thus tends to resemble the female
and young of its species, whose plumage is presumably more
primitive. I have even known such a change to be temporary
in the Calcutta Zoological Gardens some years ago two White
Pelicans, received from Europe in full colour, reverted to the
brownish immature plumage for a time, and then resumed their
adult rose-white hue. And in the London Gardens last year a
Scoresby's Gull (.Leucophaezis scoresbii ) which had lost the hood
(a sign of immaturity in this species) put it on for a time in the
autumn, only to lose it again.
There seems to be an impression abroad that all the
Anatidce lose their quills and become flightless when moulting.
But there is at least one remarkable exception, the curious Pied

Goose ( Anseranas melanoleuca) of Australia, a bird remarkable
for its un-duclc-like feet, which are only half-webbed and have a
well-developed hind toe, unlike the short useless member of
most of the family. This species was stated by that well-known
aviculturist, Mr. F. E. Blaauw, in a letter to the Ibis in 1898, only
to drop its quills gradually, so that it always retained the power
of flight, he having observed this peculiarity in birds of his own.
An assertion has been recently made to the effect that the
Coot differs from other rails in not losing all its quills at once.
This may be so in individual instances, but the contrary was
stated by St. John in his " Natural History and Sport in Moray-
shire," and my own observations on Coots confirm this state-
ment. The fact that the Coot lives more in the open than our
other Rails is 110 reason why it should not moult its quills all at
once. Dr. Blanford, in his " Fauna of British India," well says
the Coot resembles a Duck rather than a Rail in its habits, so that
\0x25A0one would expect it to moult like a Duck even if other Rails did
not. I cannot agree with Mr. Bonliote that this bird is an in-
different diver ; according to my observations it dives freely and
frequently and gets much of its food in this way, as any one may
see in the London Parks.
With regard to the Grebes becoming flightless when moult-
ing, I may mention that I pointed out that this was the case ; at
any rate in the Indian Dabcliick ( Podicipes albipe?inis ) in a paper
in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1897, which
was reprinted in the Avicultural Magazine for 1898-99.
In conclusion, reverting to the original point raised by
R. L. in the Field, I may draw attention to the fact that there is
at least one duck in which the eclipse phase of the male is a
true winter plumage--the pretty little Goose-Teal or Cotton-Teal
(. Nettopus coromandeliamis&apos;) of the East. Whether, however, the
few other members of the genus have such a plumage, and when
it is worn, I have not been able to discover so far.
[Since the above was written the question as to the eclipse plumage of
Pochards has come before the British Ornithologists' Club. I have looked
up the plate in Naumann's Naturgeschichte Vogel Europa&apos;s (pi. XIV.)
wherein undress males of the White-eyed and Common Pochard are
figured, and all I can say is that I have never seen them so feminine look-

ing as this. I have not watched more than two or three White-Eyes, and,
as I said, could not see any change in them at all ; but Miss R. Hubbard, in
her excellent book " Ornamental Waterfowl," mentions such a change. I
have, however, seen plenty of the Common Red-lieaded Pochard in summer
dress, and consider the plumage I describe for that species to be the normal
eclipse; but variation evidently occurs in it.--F. F.]

I feel reluctant to write this account of my birds because
I know several members have kept Cranes much longer than I
have and know far more about them. But I have been asked to
write, with the accompanying photograph, by one whose wishes
I cannot refuse. Also I was told by a member who has seen
most of the large private collections in England, that he had
never seen any so tame as mine, this must be my excuse.
I have only kept Crowned, Common, and Demoiselle
Cranes. Of the latter I have had six : four were males and they
have more character and are more affectionate than the females,
besides being easier to tame. The Crane in the photograph,
which is coming towards me, I have had four years. He is nine
or ten years old now, as he was kept in England some years
before I had him. He is called Timothy, he knows his name and
will come to me when I call him. Sometimes he will walk up
and down the garden paths after me, and several times he has
walked into the drawing room through an open window and re-
mained in the middle of the room till I left it. Being the oldest
male he rules the others and is the sentinel of the flock.
But he makes way for the Crowned Crane, who always
insists on eating first, and as the latter is a very greedy bird and
takes his time over his meals, not snatching at the grain in the
hurried way Demoiselles have. I have sometimes seen him
calmly taking a nap on one leg, over the seed box, while the
other Cranes are patiently waiting their turn behind. I give
them equal quantities of wheat, dari, and " husk rice," the two
latter are their favourite food. I have never yet had a Crane
which would eat either barley meal or earth worms, though I
have been told they will do so. Shrimps they like and monkey

nuts, and of course flies and all insects. The Demoiselles are
very hardy and never go under any shelter, however stormy or
wet the weather. They sleep standing on one leg on the lawn
under my window, and sometimes they will spend the whole
night in a shallow pond in the depth of winter. They prefer to
be in the open, and do not go under bushes unless they are
ill. I had one Crane which went totally blind. It was partly
paralyzed when it came to me, but it was some time before the
blindness suddenly came on. It was touching to see a hen bird
leading it to the food and water. She never left the blind one,
and the two stayed together in a quiet corner of the garden.
She was a much older bird and had always protected this delicate
young one. I had him mercifully chloroformed by a doctor (in
his sleep) as I could not bear to have him without sight. He
liked me to sit by him and stroke him and I carried him about
in my arms.
Dick, my Flamingo, and the Crowned Cranes are very
friendly and sleep together in a sheltered house. A small passage
between two aviaries leads up to this house, and it is most con-
venient for the Flamingo in frosty weather, for I notice when
there is frost on the grass he never likes to walk on it but stays
in the passage till it clears off. He feels safe and retired there
when the grass is being cut, and yet he is not shut up. His
bucket of soaked wheat and shrimps stands in the passage, and I
have never had the slightest difficulty in driving him gently
through it into his house beyond, when bedtime comes.
He takes his exercise several times a day walking up and
down the paths or racing over the lawn with a cantering step,
flapping his beautiful pink and black wings and baa-ing very
loudly. A Curlew, shy and wary of strangers but very tame
with me, is much attached to Dick, and it is amusing to see them
bathing together, the contrast in height is so funny. This little
bird has had more ' adventures.'
Since I wrote of them in the January number of the maga-
zine, his wing healed and he was able to fly again. Something
one day startled him and he must have flown over the wall. I
did not miss him for an hour or two, and then was told he was in
a large field a quarter of a mile away. Several times I took him

food there and he would run close up to me, and even took a
little nap with his head under his wing as I watched him. I
think he had not slept much and felt safe and protected while I
was there. I drove him under agate and down a lane more than
half way home, but something frightened him and he turned
back to the field again. Some men had been watching and
trying to catch him. At last they worried him so that he flew off
towards the sea, but he returned again the next day and was as
tame with me as before. At last he was caught by a man who
did not know there was a reward offered for him, taken in a sack
to a poulterer's shop (fortunately alive) and would have been
killed and eaten, but the poulterer knew about him and brought
him safely back to me.
I am quite sure birds as tame as mine enjoy being kept
loose in a garden, and do better, besides getting much tamer,
than when kept in a field. They love to search amongst the
mould for grubs and insects, and they like sometimes to stand
on gravel paths. In wet weather the Crowned Crane particularly
does not like to be always on grass, especially if it is long. But
then it is not every one who would care to give the garden up to
them and find all the bulbs dug up as soon as planted and the
grass edges destroyed. The Common Crane is the worst offender
in this respect; the Demoiselles (hens especially) do a fair
amount of digging with their sharp bills, but the Crowned
Cranes do absolutely none at all.

At this time of the year the Zoological Gardens are quite
at their best, and there is no more delightful place for the
naturalist in the Metropolis. The improvements that have been
carried out are legion, and these are having an excellent effect
on the condition of the inmates.

Cockatoos are also sitting. In the great Gulls' aviary a pair of
Choughs are sitting on three eggs, and Black Kites are nesting.
The small paddocks by the Ape-house have been wired
over and now form very useful aviaries, being thickly planted
with shrubs and provided with shelters. In these Toucans,
Tiuamous, various Starlings (amongst them Mrs. Johnstone's
pair of Sarcops colons&apos;), and many species of small birds Lave
been liberated, and some interesting nesting results will doubt-
less have to be recorded later; alread}&apos;, I understand, Green
Cardinals, Grey-necked Serins and others are nesting. In the
Waders' aviary the birds look in extremely good condition.
The Screamers in the large Eastern aviary have been steadily
sitting for some five weeks as I write, and should have hatched
before these lines appear.
But perhaps the most interesting event at the Zoo. is the
arrival of several very rare birds, brought home by Mr. Meade-
Waldo who accompanied Lord Crawford in his recent voyage in
his yacht, the " Valhalla." These consist of three Red-crowned
Fruit-Pigeons (Alectroenas pulcherrimus) and three Thrush-like
Bulbuls fIxocinchla crassirostrisJ from the Seychelles, two Sacred
Ibises, four Hemprich's Gulls f Barns hemprichi) from Aden,
three Assumption Island Rails (Dryolimnas gnla?&apos;is) and other
birds of less importance. The Fruit-Pigeons, which have been
placed in the Insect-house are extremely beautiful and remark-
able birds, the chief colour being very dark indigo blue, with a
wide collar of light grey which extends to the upper breast.
The top of the head is ornamented with bright red wattles, and
liair-like feathers of the same colour. These birds are perfectly
tame even when just caught. I may perhaps also mention the
remarkable Leaf-Insects which also came with this collection
and which should be inspected by every naturalist, although
strictly speaking they do not come within the province of this

The Grouse and Wild Turkeys of America. 267
THE GROUSE AND WILD TURKEYS OF AMERICA.
I11 the issue of this journal for March last (p. 164) we had
occasion to notice a pamphlet, issued by the United States
Department of Agriculture, on the Quails of the United States,
with special reference to their economic value. We have now
before 11s a similar pamphlet, being Bulletin No. 24 of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, on the Grouse and Wild Turkeys of
the United States.
A coloured plate of the Ruffed Grouse ( Bonasa umbellus)
forms the frontispiece, and a process plate illustrates the Sage
Grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus&apos;).
The various species of American Grouse and the Wild
Turkeys are some of the most important of game-birds, not only
on account of their value as food, but from the fact of their food
consisting, to a large extent, of noxious insects ; and the
deplorable extent to which these birds have decreased in
numbers of recent years is a subject for serious consideration.
No less than twelve species of Grouse occur within the
limits of the United States, including Alaska.
The Prairie Hen ( Tympanuchus americanus) and the
Ruffed Grouse ( Bonasa umbellus ) are the best known of the
American Grouse, the one inhabiting the open country and the
\0x25A0other the more wooded districts. Both species are becoming
scarce and their greatest enemy is man. The Ruffed Grouse is
one of the most interesting species of birds in existence, but the
average man regards it only as an object of sport and food, and
the larger " bag " he can make the better is he pleased. To
witness the courting of the Ruffed Grouse must be a treat never
to be forgotten by the ornithologist, it is described thus: "The
drumming is one of the most interesting and attractive of all
bird performances. It may be heard at every season, but is at its
best in spring. The cock, then in full vigor, mounts his
drumming log, droops his wings, raises his fan tail, and struts
along the log with his crest and glossy black neck tufts erect.
He begins beating his wings slowly ; then faster and faster, till
their rapid reverberation becomes a tattoo, rolling out a
challenge to rival cocks and a love call to the hens."

Stray Notes.
The Wild Turkey, the largest of the American Game-
birds will become extinct in a few years unless radical measures
are taken to protect it. " It is hard to realise," writes the author
of the pamphlet now before us, " that at the beginning of the
ninteenth century Turkeys were so abundant that they sold for
6 cents, a piece, though the largest ones, weighing from 25 to
3olbs., sometimes brought a quarter of a dollar. A big wild
Turkey now a days would not go long begging at 5 dollars."
It seems a great pity that no systematic attempt has been
made to propagate the various species of American Grouse in
captivity. Several of the species are known to take kindly to a
captive existence, and there can be no doubt whatever that in
large enclosures or aviaries these fine birds would at any rate
lay eggs which could be hatched artificially if the birds them-
selves would not sit. In all probability, however, the birds
would incubate naturally themselves, and being secure from their
natural enemies the several species could be propagated
extensively.
STRAY NOTES.
It is a popular fallacy that Doves are the most peaceable of birds.
We should say that ou the whole they are some of the most puguacious
birds in existence. A pair that have turned their thoughts to nesting
operations will often immediately set to work to clear every other Dove out
of the aviary. Perhaps the Australian Bar-sliouldered Dove (Geopelia
humeralis) is as bad as any in this respect and, so far as our experience goes,
it is unsafe to keep it with any other species of Dove.
The very beautiful Plumed Ground Doves (Lophophaps) are also
tremendous fighters and bullies, but being purely ground birds, other Doves
that spend most of their time aloft are fairly safe, but they will worry to
death any other ground bird from a Chinese Quail to a Pheasant, and an
unpaired member of their own species will have a short life if left in the
same aviary with a mated pair.
The Green-winged Doves ( Chalcophaps ) are again often very treach-
erous, especially to others of their own species. The writer of these notes
had a pair of the Indian form {C. indica) which had lived together for years
and reared a numerous progeny. Suddenly the cock turned upon his mate
aud within twenty-four hours she was murdered by him.

It is doubtful whether any animal is so destructive to wild bird-life as
the domestic cat that has run wild. I11 Australia and New Zealand these
creatures have been rather encouraged than otherwi.se in order that they
may act as a check upon the rabbits, but the harm they have done by des-
troying native birds is simply enormous. In the current number of the
Emu a paper on this subject by Mr. A. J. Campbell appears, in which the
author says " These injurious animals are now practically all over Australia.
You find them on the shores prowling about sea-bird rookeries, and in the
far interior thriving in rabbit burrows. They are even to be found numerous
upon the islands off the coast. After several generations in the bush-wilds
these animals attain an immense size, and become so fierce that they have
been known to attack human beings. Now, such great beasts need a
quantity of food, and of what does that food consist ? Why, of course,
native birds and animals."

Although systematic aviculture--other than the widely-
spread keeping of pet birds by the natives--exists hardly at all
in India, yet everyone there is compelled to be an aviculturist in
spite of himself, for the Crows, Kites, and Sparrows see that he
feeds and houses them to a greater or less extent. The interest-
ing, if somewhat annoying, ways of all these are most ably and
amusingly discussed in Mr. Dewar's book, for " Bombay Ducks "
does not signify the anatine waterfowl of that part of India, but
is an adaptation of an old slang term for the Anglo-Indian
residents there, applied to the animal population by our author.
Not that the essays are exclusively concerned with Bombay
animals, for they mainly relate to widety distributed forms.
Many of the birds dealt with are known to aviculturists here,
some quite familiarly, as the common Ring-Parrakeet, and some
as rare acquisitions, like the Indian Roller. It is always in-
teresting to read about the customs of such birds at large, and
from personal acquaintance with most of Mr. Dewar's subjects I
can testify to the correctness of his observations, while any
reader will be struck by his extremely scientific and reflective

way of dealing with natural history problems, for, like another
well-known Anglo-Indian naturalist, "Eha" (Mr. E. H. Aitken),
he is given to thinking for himself, the close acquaintance with
nature forced upon one in the East effectually precluding a too
easy acquiescence in the flimsily-spun theories so common in
the works of stay-at-home writers.
The illustrations are not the least valuable part of the
work; they are photographs of living birds taken by Captain
R. S. F. Fayrer, I.M.S. They are all useful for recognition, the
strongly characterized colouration and forms of common Indian
birds making photographs of them far more striking likenesses
than is the case with our well-known species, and some of them
are really beautiful pictures, such as the cow accompanied by
the Cattle-Egrets and the Scavenger-Vulture brooding on her
nest by a pinnacle. Taken altogether this is a most important
contribution to the growing literature dealing with the common
animals of our Indian possessions, and a book I would recom-
mend to all interested in wild life. Frank Finn.
THE EGGS OF EUROPEAN BIRDS. *
The first part of this important work which will run into
about ten parts and deal with all the known European species,
has reached us.
The author has followed the recommendation of the Fifth
International Zoological Congress with regard to nomenclature,
and fully recognises all the geographical races of the various
species as worked out by Dr. Hartert in his book 011 the Birds of
the Palsearctic fauna, and of course the tri-nomial system of
nomenclature has been adopted.
It is, of course, very important that the geographical races
of the various species should be recognized if they are found to
differ constantly from one another, and thus the system of tri-
nomial nomenclature for which, in this country, Dr. Hartert is
largely responsible, is essential. The Continental form of the
Jay is found to differ from our own bird, and as this was the

form which Linnaeus named Garrulus glandarins, our own bird
has to rank as a sub-species under the name of G. glandarins
rufitergum. It will take some time for naturalists of the old
school to get into the way of adopting this comparatively new
system, but it seems to us that the various local forms must be
recognized and named. This system also necessitates the lump-
ing together of genera, as for instance the Goldfinches, Siskins,
Linnets, Redpolls and Citral Finches, all of which are put into
the genus Carduelis.
But one of the objects of the tri-nomial system is to limit
the number of genera, and, although there are several geo-
graphical races of the Goldfinch, there is only one species, and
hence it simplifies the study of ornithology considerably if other
nearly allied, though quite distinct, species are put into the same
genus.
But the author of the book now under notice is not him-
self responsible for these changes in the naming of familiar
species, he is merely following in the lead of others whose system
is without doubt the correct one and will be followed.
Great care appears to have been taken to render the book
reliable, the eggs, nests and surroundings are minutely des-
cribed, and where the different geographical races differ in their
nesting habits or the colour of their eggs, this difference is
pointed out.
The coloured plates of eggs, which form one of the chief
features of the work, are good, and all of the principal varieties
are figured. We shall hope to notice the future parts in due
course.

Sir, -- 111 the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine Mr. Astley
mentions some Humming Birds that lived some time in Milan. I am able
to add a few particulars that, I am sure, will interest your readers. One or
two months ago a Genoese bird-dealer wrote to ask whether I would allow
a Milanese lady to see my collection of birds and especially my Humming
Birds. I wrote at once that I was perfectly willing to show all the birds I

had, but that I had no Humming Birds, for they could not live in captivity.
Shortly afterwards the lady called on me, and her first exclamation was
" How can you say that Humming Birds cannot live in captivity? I have
kept them for some time." Naturall}- I plied her with questions and she
told me that when she lived in the Argentine Republic she found a nest of
unfledged Humming Birds and placed it in a trap-cage. The mother
fluttered round it in despair till she found the entrance to it, when she soon
settled on the nest and was captured with her young. They were fed on
sugar melted in water, but the lady soon found out they needed insects, and
hit upon an ingenious device for cultivating small midgt. for them. She
kept a barrel of fruit in the room, and as the fruit fermented with the heat
of the room it gave birth to numberless midges, which the birds devoured.
The young ones flourished and grew till they could not be distinguished
from the parent bird, and lived happily for several months. She succeeded
in bringing them over to Milan, where they liv&lt;~d for two months more
and were quite tame. She showed me a series of photographs of the lovely
tiny creatures perched on her finger or hovering over a flower, and told me
how she had nursed them and how fearless and tame they were. They
could not stand the motion of a carriage, and she had to walk from the ship
to the Hotel, holding them in the hollow of her hand.
I hope to get many more interesting particulars from this lady, when
I go to see her in Milan, for her visit to me was very hurried, as she only
remained a few hours in Florence, and we had to exchange experiences
about other birds; but I am sure even these few lines on these fragile
creatures will be of interest to aviculturists.
I have read in an old book that Budgerigars were very delicate birds,
that it was almost impossible to bring them to Europe alive, as they could
neither stand the journey nor the climate. Nowadays Budgerigars are
among the hardiest of birds. Who knows but that in a few years time
Humming Birds may be not only brought over, but bred and reared in
Europe ? GlUElE Tommasi BaedeEEI.

DIAMOND FINCHES.
Sir, --It may interest you to hear that I have at present (May 9th) in
my small garden-aviary a pair of Diamond Finches (Steganopleura guttata)
that have been sitting on seven eggs from the 6th of this month. The nest
is built in a small borax soap box hung rather high inside the wooden shed,
and underneath a window the glass of which I had painted green and then
dabbed over with a plug of dry cloth) this subdues the suns rays and gives a
cooling opaque appearance which I like to think the birds take for growing
foliage). The nest itself is composed of fine larch twigs, wisps of green grass
which they preferred to hay that was given, the inside is lined entirely with

cotton wool; feathers, moss, etc. being left untouched on the aviary floor.
Both birds are very attentive sitters, the cock bird lioppiug into the nest
directly his wife comes out for an airing and food.
Last summer from the same pair of birds I had two nests, seven
young in the first about June, and two in the second nest in Septemberi,* all
were reared and grew up strong vigorous birds.
I attribute my success to the aviary being situated in a sunny south
aspect, and to keeping just a single pair of birds in a compartment quite to
themselves.
It is, of ( arse, not possible in this way to keep so many kinds of
birds, and to possess a varied collection of gay-plumaged occupants is very
pretty to look at, though often proving disappointing and disheartening,
especially so as the breeding season comes round when tragedies will occur
in the best of model mixed collections.
When I first started an aviary I had six pairs of apparently harmless
birds in the space where I now only keep one pair. Before the year was
out however half had been killed off or maimed in some way, nests that had
looked so promising and hopeful were destroyed, eggs purloined and
hardly a single youngster reared. By the present system I now not only pay
for all seed and food used but have substantial balance in hand at the end
of the season from the sale of young birds. Frank; Bathe;.

Sir, --I am of course well aware that the fact of fresh air being of
more importance to birds than warmth was not an original discovery of Dr.
Creswell's. He has never claimed that it was, nor has any one claimed it
for him, that I know of. What I stated was, that he had arrived at certain
conclusions, one of them being " that fresh air and aseptic conditions are
of more importance to birds than heat." He was not the discoverer of this,
but he was the first writer to give scientific reasons for the fact which pre-
vious observers had noticed but could not explain.
The egg question is a large one, and I can hardly expect yon to
afford me space to go into the evidence. But the little fact that all Mr.
Townsend's prize-winners are total abstainers from egg is worthy of note.
I do not know who Dr. Butler refers to under the pronoun " we," but
if he wishes to imply that his old associates in the foundation of the
Avicultural Society were in the habit of feeding their insectivorous birds,
(as he says he fed his), on a combination of oatmeal and pea-meal and other
abominations, I respectfully plead not guilty&apos;, on behalf of myself and our
quondam associates. No doubt a mixture such as Century&apos; Food, containing
yolk of egg, would be superior to such rubbish; (But in those days we
never took Dr. Butler seriously on questions of food--if I recollect rightly
he used, among other eccentricities, to recommend bread crumbs for Night-

ingales. If his birds which he calls survivals, have been fed on a good
insectivorous mixture, whether with or without egg, and those imported
with them were fed on some such rubbish as he refers to, it is not to be
wondered at that his have survived longer than the rest. Though one does
wonder how he obtained his statistics, and what evidence he could give of
their accuracy. The mere disuse of egg will not enable aviculturists to
keep insectivorous birds on pea-meal and the like. All we claim is that as
between a good mixture containing egg, and an equally good mixture with-
out egg, the latter is more conducive to health and longevity ; and if Dr.
Butler and his followers will not believe this, the loss is theirs, not ours.
Any observation which "Onlooker" may be pleased to make over his
own signature I will reply to, but I do not feel called upon to take further
notice of a pseudonymous correspondent. Horatio R. Fillmer.

Sir,-- Being a member of the Avicultural Society I am writing to
ask whether you could kindly give me any advice as to remedying the great
inconvenience which is caused by the purchase of birds which have had
one wing cut, and are therefore unfit for an outdoor aviary ? This seems to
be a general practice. I have had a Red-faced Lovebird, and a Blue-winged
Lovebird sent to me lately both having one wing cut, and the dealers say
they come to them in that condition. Is there any way of softening the
flesh round the stump feathers so that stumps could be extracted without
hurting the bird. It would be a very painful process if one attempted to
pull out the feathers even by degrees. The moulting season is over for the
Bluewings and I should have to wait until next season before the bird could
go to the aviary. (Mrs.) J. M. FfoulkeS-

Ibis cethiopica.
By Michael J. Nicoll, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
During the past voyage of the Earl of Crawford's yacht
"Valhalla" we spent several days at Cape Town, and while there
were able to pay a visit to Dassen Island which is distant about
45 miles from Cape Town.
&apos; Dassen Island is the home of a vast number of birds, and
is a Government preserve chiefly used for guano collecting. At
the time of our visit the Penguins ( Sfiheniscus demursus) were
hardly beginning to lay, but the Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax ca-
pensis and P. 7 ieglectus, had well-grown young in an enormous
colony, and close to this Cormorant Rookery a number of Sacred
Ibises had young in their nests. The nests of this species were
placed so close together that they resembled a single large flat
heap of rubbish with a number of depressions on it containing
young Ibises. We were told that the Ibises were always killed
whenever possible or their nests destroyed, as they do a great
amount of harm to the young Cormorants, killing them and
devouring their entrails. This sounds almost incredible, but it
is apparently quite true, as all the young Ibises when first
handled disgorged a mass of entrails. In this colony of Ibises
were several well-grown young, and two of these were obtained
and brought safely to England, when Lord Crawford presented
them to the Zoological Society. During the voyage these birds
were fed almost entirely on raw meat cut into small squares, and
on this, grit, and plenty of fresh water they did exceedingly well.
During the day they were allowed free run of the deck,
where they took frequent baths in fresh water.

Nesting of Bourke&apos;s Parrakeet.
Every morning a casting, chiefly composed of grit and
mucous, was brought up before they took their food.
In my illustration one bird, it will be seen, is drooping one
wing; this they often did, especially when quite young and
when standing in the sun. These birds grew rapidly, especially
as regards their bills, and after a time they moulted many of the
black feathers of the neck, which were replaced by white ones.
By the time we reached England they had begun to moult their
long secondaries and the beautiful plume-like feathers were
beginning to take their place.
I rarely heard these young Ibises utter any noise, the
smaller one certainly made a loud chirping noise every morning
when let out, but beyond that I never heard a sound from them.
When first hatched the young Sacred Ibis is covered with
a short white down, with the exception of the crown, cheeks
and hind neck on which the down is black. The crown of the
head having a white patch in the centre. The iris is black.
Bill pinkish lavender and quite straight. Tarsi and toes pinkish
flesh colour. Later on the base and tip of the bill get black
and finally this colour spreads until the whole bill is black.

From the very first day on which I commenced to keep
Parrakeets, I have looked forward to the time when I could
acquire the beautiful Bourke's, and many are the dealers I have
commissioned to procure them, but without success until, in May
1904, I received a telegram from Mr. Jamrach--"Come at once,
one pair only Bourke's and Princess of Wales"--I lost no time
in calling upon Mr. Jamrach, and came away with the two pairs
of birds at a price many times greater so far as the Bourke's
are concerned than what they have recently been offered at;
but as this was the first pair that had been seen in England for
many years I was quite satisfied with the bargain. They were in
excellent condition and I believe would have nested that year if
I had not lost the hen, which flew against a perch and broke her

neck. I remember one of our members, who came from Scot-
land to see my birds, making the discovery of the dead bird in
the grass. I did not expect to see any more imported for some
years, and was agreeably surprised to receive a wire from Mr.
Hamlyn in March, 1905, saying he was getting some home. Out
of this consignment, and another lot which I believe arrived in
April of the same year, I procured six, only one of which I was
able to get into health, the others all dying within two months.
The survivor is the parent of the two strong and healthy birds
now flying about as well as any birds I have.
There is practically nothing to record. They appear
to be easy to breed, and sit very steadily, the hen never leaving
the nest even when I have tried to disturb her. They are quiet
and peaceable birds, and not in the least interesting, excepting
in the evening before going to roost, when they fly about very
wildly. The young are marked exactly as the adult pair, the
only difference I can discover being their rather smaller size.
The old pair are now nesting again. Neither these birds nor any
of the Grass Parrakeets (excepting the Budgerigars) can stand
much cold, and I am of opinion they cannot be kept alive for
any lengthy period without growing grass to eat.
I should be pleased to show any of our members the young
birds, as well 'as other interesting parrakeets I have bred this
year.

The Green-winged Pigeons ( Chalcophaps ) are some of the
most brilliant of the Pigeon tribe if we except the true fruit-
eating Pigeons. Six species are recognised, but some of these
are merely insular forms of the two best known species, namely
Chalcophaps chrysochlora and C. indica.
The typical C. chrysochlora inhabits Australia, the Lesser
Sunda Islands, Moluccas, New Guinea, the New Hebrides, New
\0x25A0Caledonia, and Lord Howe Island. The back and wings are
shining metallic green, in some lights showing a golden hue, the

head, neck, breast and abdomen vinous purple, with a bluish
tinge on the nape. On the lower back are two bars of bluish
grey. The tail is black. The male has very conspicuous white
patches on the shoulders which are lacking in the female. The
bill is bright orange inclining to red in some specimens. The
true Chalcophaps indica inhabits the whole of the Indian Peninsula,
Ceylon, the Andaman and. Nicobar Islands, South China, the
Malay Peninsula, Celebes, the Moluccas, and. New Guinea.
In the male of C. indica the forehead and a line passing
from this over the eye are white, and the crown and nape are
bluish lead-colour, otherwise the colour is similar to that of the
Australasian species.
In the British Museum Catalogue of Birds the total length
of C. chrysochlora is given as 9-5 inches, while that of C. i?idica
is said to be 10-5 inches. Certainly in all of the living specimens
I have seen the Australasian birds have been appreciably larger
than those of the Indian species. A fine male of the former
now in my aviary appears to be fully ten inches or more in
length, while a typical cabinet specimen of C. indica now before
me measures but eight and a half inches. But skin measure-
ments are seldom of much value.
In October 1903 a female specimen of C. natalis the
Christmas Island form of C. indica was received at the Zoological
Gardens. The male of this form is said to be indistinguishable
from that of C. indica , but the female differs in having the upper
tail-coverts and central tail-feathers bright cinnamon colour,
while the neck, breast and upper back are strongly tinged with
this colour. This bird paired with a typical Indian specimen
and one young bird, a male, was reared, which cannot be
distinguished from the pure-bred males.
With the exception of this single specimen of C. natalis
the only species of Chalcophaps that have ever been imported
alive to this country, so far as I am aware, are the two above
mentioned.
It is only natural that so brilliantly coloured a bird as a
Green-winged Pigeon should, in a wild state, inhabit thickly
wooded country. Those who have known these beautiful birds
in a state of freedom are agreed that they rarely, if ever, leave

the wooded for tlie open country, unless it is to dash from one
clump of trees to another. They are solitary in their habits and
not often to be seen, being practically invisible amongst the
green leaves of the trees. Their note is a very soft and plaintive
coo which is practically identical in both the Australian and
Indian species.
In captivity these birds do best in a large aviary in which
are thick-growing trees and an abundance of brushwood fixed up
beneath shelters. They almost invariably seek a nesting site in
some fairly dark place, either on the top of a clump of brush-
wood underneath the roof of the covered portion of the aviary,
or in the middle of a tree with plenty of leafy branches above
them.
During the summers of 1904 and 1905 the Indian species
bred freely in my aviary, usually selecting a fairly dark corner
in the covered portion. The nest is the usual doves platform of
sticks and grass-stems. The eggs are cream-coloured, not white,
and the young, when first hatched are almost black, scantily
covered with whitish down. On leaving the nest the young birds
are dark brown, the feathers of the head, breast and wing coverts
being broadly margined with chestnut. Some of the lesser wing-
coverts are green, and there is a distinct greenish tinge to some
of the secondaries and their coverts. There are two conspicuous
white bars on the rump.
The Australasian species is far less often imported than
the Indian form, and I believe, has never been bred in captivity
until this year. Early last January I obtained a pair of C.
chrysochlora from New Caledonia, and later a male of the same
species from Queensland. The latter specimen is a remarkably
fine bird, somewhat larger than the first male, which he soon
challenged for the possession of the hen, which was also a very
fine bird. I had to remove the New Caledonian cock or he
would have soon been bullied to death by his stronger rival, and
the remaining pair soon set about selecting a nesting site. They
are both shy birds and generally keep out of sight when any-
one is near, and I had no idea that a nest had been built until
one day in May, when I entered the covered aviary, the cock
dashed from a dark corner where, high up, a bundle of sticks

and brushwood had been fixed, and disappeared through an
opening into the outer aviary. Getting a pair of steps I soon
discovered a nest containing two creamy-white eggs. With this
species as with all of the Pigeon tribe, so far as I am aware, the
male sits during the greater part of the day, the female taking
his place during the late afternoon and sitting throughout the
night. One egg eventually disappeared from this nest, probably
having been knocked out by one of the birds as it dashed from
the nest. The other successfully hatched, I cannot say the exact
date as I was most careful to go near the nest as seldom as
possible, but on May 26th I looked in the nest and discovered a
plump black squab, evidently hatched two or three days before.
When it left the nest (June 13th) it appeared to be identical with
the young of C. indica, but somewhat larger. As I write (June
17th) it is able to fly well, though it still frequently returns to
the nest.
Green-winged Pigeons of both species are apt to be very
pugnacious towards other doves, especially when about to com-
mence nesting, but taking them all round they are most attractive
birds and their beauty is almost unsurpassed so far as the
graminivorous Doves are concerned.
THE TUFTED DUCK.
By Hugh Wormald.
Having, more or less successfully, reared a brood of Tufted
Ducks (Fuligula cristata ) under a hen last summer, I venture to
give my experience.
I obtained ten eggs and put them under a wild duck, in-
cubation lasting, I think, twenty-four days (but I have no notes
and am trusting to memory). The duck successfully hatched
nine, and then my troubles began. The wild duck proved to be
a very bad foster-mother; she would have nothing to do with the
young Tufted Ducks at all. I think the reasons of this were
that it was late in the season (end of June), and that a wild duck,
as far as my experience goes, always covers her young for at
least twelve hours after hatching, whereas the Tufted Ducks were

most independent little fellows, and started off to the pond on
their own account at the early age of three hours. When they
were replaced under the duck she promptly trod one of them to
death, so they were taken away from her for good and put under
a hen for an hour or two ; she was apparently delighted, perhaps
because she had only been sitting a fortnight. The hen and
ducklings were then put in my wader aviary which encloses the
end of a pond, where the ducklings throve famously on duck-
weed, dried flies, and ants' eggs floating on the water; they
refused meal for the first week. They were very lively, swim-
ming and diving for five hours on end the first day they were
hatched. I had great trouble with them at night, as nothing
would induce them to go into the hen's coop. I had to catch
them every evening for the first six weeks in a butterfly net and
put them in the coop. I consider I was lucky that they met with
no ill effects from this treatment; they never went into their coop
of their own accord by day or night. One squeezed out of the
aviary through the wire netting the first week, and was trampled
on by the other ducks outside; the following week another,
falling down a small but rather steep bank in the aviary, and
landing on his back, was unable to right himself, and died. This
left six, two drakes and four ducks, all of which grew up, and
are, I believe, still flourishing. I only kept one pair myself.
They are easy ducks to rear if sufficient care and trouble
can be spent on them. A pond is, in my opinion, essential, and,
as with all young birds, it is necessary to choose their diet care-
fully. I found that moths, flies, daddy-long-legs, ants' eggs,
duck-weed, dried flies, gnats, etc. are very readily taken by these
young ducks ; they soon took to meal, and grew faster than any
ducklings I have ever reared. Their food should be floating , at
any rate until they take to meal. At first they are little dusky
chaps, with yellowish breasts, of a very sturdy build, with short
bills, big heads and feet, with particularly long down on the
head. Their first plumage is a dark brown, a little lighter on
the flanks. Ducks and drakes are difficult to distinguish till
about October when the drakes are assuming their full winter
plumage, though their heads are not so bright, crests not so long,

fancy they breed until two years old.

in Norfolk in June last year.
A FEW NOTES ON BIRDS ON THE ATBARA IN
SOUDAN.
A short time ago I took up my residence on the River
Atbara, twenty-seven miles from its junction with the Nile. At
this time of year the river hardly exists, there remaining big
pools mostly connected by a trickle of water.
The birds are not numerous or noticeable. Sandgrouse
(.Pteroclurus exustus) are by far the most common, coming down
regularly every morning in thousands to drink. I have seen
numerous pairs of Pterocles quadricinctus in the wormscrub, and
shot one specimen of what I take to be Pleroclurus senegallus.
The most noticeable bird is the common Egyptian Goose (C.
(Egyptiacus), not on account of numbers but because of the noise
they make, both morning and evening when they come and sit
on the top of the broken-down palms and call. Two days ago
a pair brought off a brood on the pool above my camp, but I
am afraid the crocodiles will get them.
Demoiselle Cranes are fairly numerous, feeding amongst
the Donklin crops on the sandbanks : they are excellent eating.
At the moment of writing I can see a party of Teal and Shovel-
lers in the shallow water opposite, accompanied by a solitary
Ruddy Sheldrake; while nearer to me are several Black-winged
Stilts (Himantopus himantopus ) and Ring Plovers (.AEgialitis
dubia), Scop Spurwing (Hoplopterus spinosus ) and Egyptian
Plovers (Pluvianus czgypticus), and one or two other similar birds
the names of which I do not know. Further away down stream
is a party of Adjutant Storks and a few Abdim Bey's Storks
(. Abdimia abdimi ), and an Ibis, black all over, a patch of white at
base of bill. African River Eagles (Haliastus vocifer) are very
common, and a pair often comes and sits in the palms by my
camp during the day. On two occasions I have seen Bateleur

Eagles, and several times Melierax polyzonus (Rupp). There are
other birds of prey about, but I dare not venture to name them.
A few Herons show up in the evening.
The common Bustard seems numerous, and is extremely
wary: I have not bagged one yet, as one cannot easily get
within gunshot. Pigeons and Doves are numerous, but I can
only name with certainty Turtur ambiguus, and the pretty
little Long-tailed Dove, CEna capensis. The Pied Kingfisher is
common and is, I fancy, nesting here. Of birds close round my
Take (grasshut) is the Bulbul ( P . asinoe ) a great friend and the
Black Bush Robin ; a party of White-headed Babbling Thrushes ;
Blue Finches, and Fire Finches, a Pied Wagtail, and numerous
unnameable Warblers. The common black and yellow Weaver,
Pied Flycatchers, and a Solitary Pearl-spotted Barbet.
A little further up stream in the thicker scrub are
Green Parrakeets (Palceornis docilis), now nesting in holes in
tops of dom palms. The beautiful Black and Scarlet Bush
Shrike (.Laniarius erythrogasta ) seems common. This I consider
one of the most striking birds here--the back appears in the sun
to be a gorgeous metallic green and the whole breast a most
lovely brilliant crimson-red.
Nectarinia metallica, a most beautiful little Sun-bird, with
a back of shiny green and a yellow breast, a very dainty little
bird, is a great favourite of mine, as is also N. pulchella , though
I have not seen any of the latter here yet. Mr. Butler kept a
specimen of the last named alive in good health in Khartum for
ten days, when it unfortunately escaped.
The common Sparrow abounds, and P. luteus , the Yellow
Sparrow is also fairly common. I took eggs of the latter recently,
the nest was very roughly built of twigs, partially downed and
lined with cotton. Eggs, three in number, more round than
oblong, dirty white streaked and blotched with dark chocolate all
over.
There are many birds not mentioned in this short note,
owing to my being unable to identify them, but should it prove
of sufficient interest, I will be pleased to get specimens named
by Mr. Butler, the Du of Game Preservation--and to send a few
lines more for the Magazine. Waiter Gilbey Percivae.

Perhaps the following rough notes may be interesting.
My Ravens began to build this year on the 2nd February,
and they have reared two fine young birds, which I have just
sent to a fellow aviculturist in Norfolk who, I know, will give
them a comfortable home.
The Demoiselle Cranes have two young ones, hatched in
Whitsun week, and doing well.
A fine pair of Pteroclurus senegallus , a species of Sand-
grouse which I think has not yet been bred in this country, have
laid several eggs, but will not sit. I have placed two of their
eggs in the nest-hole of a pair of P. alchatus, together with one
of their own, and they are being incubated.
The old pair of Suow3 ? ' Owls, now in their 16th year, have
a nest (5 eggs), and are near hatching. My only adult Great
Bustard has laid several eggs, raided, in spite of " scarecrows,''
as I thought by Rooks or Jackdaws. But one evening I saw a
White Crane walking about with an egg in his beak, the contents
dribbling on to the ground, with the old hen Bustard disconso-
lately following him. The Crane was removed, and the Bustard
laid again, and is now sitting on a couple of farmyard goose eggs.
Two pairs of Temminck's Tragopans have laid eggs, as
usual in old Woodpigeons nest, purposely fixed up in bushes at
some height from the ground. One clutch of eggs was unfertile ;
but the other resulted in two fine young birds.
A Capercaillie hen made a beautiful nest at the foot of a
birch tree. As she sat her tail used to extend erect up the
stem of the tree. Not feeling very great confidence in her, for
though imported several years ago she is timid and shy, as are
all wild caught Capers in my experience, I took her eggs and
hatched them (6) under a hen, giving her some fowls' eggs. She
has brought off several young chickens, and it is curious to see
how wild they are under her guidance, it being quite difficult to
get a sight of them in the long grass and reeds where they hide
up. Three of the young Capercaillies are doing well.
Two Grey hens have been sitting for some time. As their
hatching dates approach we shall take their eggs too.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens. 285
A very tame hen Grouse, which by the way has not seen
heather for two-and-a-half years, laid a clutch of eggs (unfertile).
As soon as she began to sit, a kind friend allowed me to send up
to the moors for a nest of wild Grouse eggs partly incubated.
There were eight eggs, but one was damaged in transit; each of
the others produced a young Grouse chick 011 the 12th inst. In
my man's last report they were said to be doing as well as
possible. But my most interesting nests probably are : (1) Pine
Grosbeaks (3 eggs*), and (2) that of an American Widgeon. Both
birds have been sitting steadily, and the former should be soon
hatching. If I have success with the young in these two cases
I shall have further details to communicate.
A pair of Green Bulbuls (Chloropsis aurifrons) appeared to
be going to nest at the end of May ; and the male went so far as
to line with dry grass in most neat fashion an old Miseltoe
Thrush's nest. But the hen bird seemed a trifle amiss at the
critical time, and nothing further resulted.

The important event of the past month has been the
arrival of the Prince of Wales' Indian Collection which was
opened on the 13th of June, when Their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess, with their children, visited the Collection
and made a tour of the Gardens. Unfortunately the birds be-
longing to the Collection mostly died on the voyage or before
starting, the heat of the plains being too great for them, but the
mammals that have arrived safely are well worth inspection.
A very great improvement has been made at the Gardens
in the opening of the new bridge over the Canal, which makes
the North Garden far more accessible than was formerly the case.
Very interesting events are happening at the Gardens so
far as the birds are concerned. In one of the aviaries on the
South side of the Parrot-house Varied Lorikeets are sitting,
Juue 25th. There are two young Pine Grosbeaks doing well.--W. H. St. Q.

as is also a female Red-sided Eclectus paired to a male Grand
Eclectus, and a pair of Eclectus in the large Canal-Bank Aviary
appear to be nesting. In this aviary the two young Leadbeaters'
Cockatoos, mentioned in last month's Zoo. Notes, are flying and
can hardly be distinguished from the adults. This appears to be
the second instance of this species breeding in captivity, the
former being in Mrs. Johnstone's aviaries at Rougham Hall,
Suffolk, as recorded in this Journal for August 1901.
On the North Bank a pair of Asiatic White Cranes have a
nest, and are sitting on one egg.
Common Mynahs, Green Cardinals,Wouga-Wonga Pigeons
and Bar-shouldered Doves have young, while a pair of Porphyrios
are sitting.
In the Seal Pond Enclosure a pair of Black-footed Pen-
guins are sitting. Young Penguins would be very attractive
little creatures, and it .is much to be hoped that the nest may be
brought to a satisfactory conclusion. This species has been
bred on the Continent but never as yet in England.
Besides numbers of young Pheasants, three young
Cholmley's Rock Partridges have been hatched in the incubator,
as well as a very remarkable hybrid between the last-mentioned
species and the Californian Quail. D. S-S.
THE GIZA ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
The Report on the above institution for the year 1905 is to
hand, and it is satisfactory to find that the year was the most
important in the history of these Gardens. The Government
increased the subsidy, and thus enabled certain long-wished-for
reforms to be carried out. The price of admission was lowered,
and the number of visitors exceeded that of the previous year by
112,876.
An interesting exhibition has been provided in the form of
a collection of characteristic Nile birds which all live together
in a state of semi-freedom ; these comprise three Whale-headed
Storks, two Saddle-bill Storks, Sacred Ibis, Crowned, Demoiselle
and Grey Cranes, Flamingoes, Egyptian Geese, Spurwing Geese
and Brown-necked Ravens.

Two very unusual meteorological events occurred during
the year, namely a very severe thunderstorm during which three
very fine Australian Silk - Oak trees were killed by lightning,
and in December there was frost several nights running which
did much damage to tropical plants and shrubs and killed
hundreds of fish, though the mammals and birds seemed none
the worse for the abnormal visitation of winter weather.
The total number of birds bred in the Gardens during the
year is not a large one, namely fifteen Zebra-finches, two Buff-
backed Herons, four Barbary Doves, four Central African Doves
(Turhir decipiens&apos;), nine Palm Doves (T. senegaleusis) and fourteen
Barred Doves (Geopelia striata), besides which four Water-hens
(Gallinula chloropsis ) were hatched, but apparently not reared.
Considering what shy breeders the Barred Doves usually are in
captivity, the rearing of fourteen in one year is an extraordinary
event. But what might not we do in this country if we had the
Egyptian climate? The breeding of Buff-backed Herons is
perhaps the most noteworthy event, so far as the birds are
concerned.
Besides the Annual Report of this institution we have
received a Report of a Mission undertaken by the Director, in
accordance with a decision of the Council of Ministers, to the
various Zoological Gardens of Europe, with a view to the acqui-
sition of information for the benefit of the Giza Gardens.
In this Report Captain Flower gives a most instructive
and useful list of the Zoological Gardens of the World and of
the dates of their foundation. During his tour of inspection he
visited no less than thirty-one different Zoological Gardens, and
of the chief of these he gives an account in this Report, besides
numerous Aquariums and Zoological Museums. It is satisfactory
to note that, after visiting all the chief Zoological collections,
Captain Flower comes to the conclusion that Regent's Park
contains the most valuable collection ever brought together.

Sir, --In my aviary, amongst other birds I have a fawn and white
Bengalee hen. A cock Spice-bird and a cock Bronze Mannikin have paid
her great attention and assisted in making a nest in a small box hung on
the wall. Four eggs were laid, both cocks sitting on the eggs in turn when
the hen has been off for food and a bath. I never expected the eggs to
hatch, thinking they must be unfertile. I looked in the nest to-day
and to my great surprise, found two young birds, one much larger than the
other (a week old I should think) very fat, crop well-filled with egg, no sign
of any feathers. I shall be unable to tell with which bird the hen mated
until the young ones are out of the nest.

Sir,--T here is one point about the Parrot community which I have
not seen mentioned in letters about cage birds and it is, I know, a point
that many keepers of a wretched and solitar} T Parrot or Cockatoo never
think of, namely, providing their prisoner with toys. A splendid Lemon-
crested Cockatoo, a member of a family I know well (I cannot speak of her
in any other terms!) is given all sorts of toys, and my Yellow-nape also,
empty cotton reels especially if presented in a blown-out paper bag, cinders,
a lump of rotten wood, also, if possible, done up in a parcel, sticks of
wholesome wood with the bark on, a bit of tape tied to the wires to pull at,
etc., etc., post cards, and so on.
" Cocky," from whom I learn these ideas, is now quite forty and a
most flourishing person. Possibly, if you think it worth while, you would
insert a suggestion to the effect in our Magazine. I am sure it would
bring pleasure to many a bird. (Mrs.) M. Wieeiams.
NESTING NOTES.
Sir, --I was unusually lucky last year, rearing many birds in my
aviaries, but I feel sure it was owing to the warm summer. There are a
number of birds in my aviaries, so they often get disturbed.
This year the Red Cardinals have hatched and eaten one lot or
three already and, on May 17th, have three more in the nest a few days old.
The Green Cardinals have three nice young ones in the nest about fourteen
days old. A tiresome habit the young Red Cardinals have is that of coming
out of the nest at ten days old when they have very few feathers 011, but
the Green Cardinals are very easy to rear, compared with the Reds, as the
young ones stay in the nest till well grown.
The Red-winged Parrakeets are in a separate aviary sitting on four
good eggs. I have two hen Blue Robins, and one has laid three eggs in a
cigar box, but of course they will be no use. Other birds sitting are Grass
Finches, Trumpeter Bullfinches, Zebra-finches and Canaries.
Last year I reared five Blue-winged Love Birds, one Crimson-winged

Sir, --It is satisfactory to me to know that my reply to Mr. Fillmer
has induced him to modify his statement on p. 214 of the Magazine, that
" Chiefly in consequence of the work of Dr. Creswell, we have now begun
to see (the italics are mine) that aviculture, if it is to be in any true sense
scientific, must be correlated to the sciences of hygiene and pathology as
well as that of ornithology."* Now Mr. Fillmer frankly admits that we
began to see the importance, at any rate of hygiene, long before Dr. Creswell
stepped upon the stage ; but he still thinks we ought to worship this great
student for explaining to us how it is that fresh air drawn into the lungs
invigorates the body, and he asserts dogmatically that previous observers
could not explain this truth, which most intelligent youths are familiar
with, or certainly all those who have ever taken sufficient interest in
medical science to read and understand.
When I first began to keep birds, mjr " old associates in the founda-
tion of the Avicultural Society" were quite unknown to me; so that if Mr.
Fillmer had begun to indulge in the same study at that period, I certainly
am not in a position to state what his treatment was. I began without any
knowledge derived from books; and, until the appearance of "Cassell's
Cage Birds " I had to try experiments to discover the best foods upon which
to rear and keep birds. I knew a few other bird-keepers, and we used to
compare experiences (that is the we which Mr. Fillmer wishes explained).
I do not admit the possibility of a food being " equalty good" without egg,
until a good substitute as valuable for the nourishment of birds has been
discovered.
Now Mr. Fillmer makes the mistake of resorting to discourtesj'--"in
those days we never took Dr. Butler seriously on questions of food;" and
yet in 1S99, in a review of " Foreign Bird Keeping" I find a lament that the
important subject of food was not more fully discussed in a work of that
kind; with the appended remark that my method of feeding soft-billed
birds did not commend itself to my reviewer; if so he should have rejoiced
at my reticence.
The we of Mr. Fillmer's uncalled for observation appears to refer
chiefly to himself and a neighbour (Mr. Septimus Perkins); indeed from his
* I frankly confess that I don't understand the last six words of this statement: I
always thought that ornithology was the study of birds and therefore included all the
branches of bird study. A.G.B.

further remark about my recommendation of bread crumbs (as part of the
food-mixture) for Nightingales, it is quite evident that the latter gentleman
is his partner in the pronoun : let us then see what Mr. Perkins recommend-
ed as " the best I could give " for feeding Warblers (that gentleman included
the smaller Thrushes among his Warblers); he says--" soaked ants' eggs, hard
boiled egg, and grated carrot, mixed together with a few bread crumbs;
milk sop, and a liberal supply of mealworms." ( Avic . Mag. 1st ser., vol. IV.
p. 4). What with the egg and the breadcrumbs and the bread again in the
milk sop, I fear that even part of the we that did not take me seriously
would now be in little better case.t
Some little time since I was reading a series of articles by Mr. Fillmer
on the subject of food for cage birds, and I must confess that, with the
exception of an attack upon egg, and the fact that he had not experimented
with certain seeds, and therefore was not prepared to say whether he
considered them injurious or otherwise, I could have imagined that I had
prepared the articles myself; indeed they reminded me strongly of Chapter
III. in my " Hints on Cage Birds." It is therefore possible that Mr. Fillmer
may not take himself seriously on questions of food, and a man who has no
faith in himself is not fit to instruct others.
Why should Mr. Fillmer " wonder " that I, when I purchase a bird
out of a batch, should take the trouble to enquire after the health of the
others. ? Are aviculturists expected to be so self-centred that they can take
no interest in the possessions of their neighbours? One fact is certain--I
never make any statement in print which is not based upon careful
enquiries; so that, when I assert that a bird of mine is the only one or
seven imported in one batch which survived, and that it alone was fed upon
egg, I know that I am stating a positive fact. Never hint that your
opponent is fabricating proofs ; it is not a polite thing to do.

A RARE CARDINAL.
Sir,--I s a red Cardinal, that I lately purchased, a specimen of
Cardinalis phceniceus ?
It is a male bird, and is said to have come from Venezuela. It is
smaller than C. virginianus, its total length being seven inches from the
tip of the bill to the end of the tail, when the head is in the ordinary
position in life, i.e. not stretched out. The bill, which is large for the size
of the bird, is lioru colour, there is no mask of black feathers round the
base, and the crest is perhaps more upright and longer in proportion than
in the common Virginian Red Cardinal.
This South American bird is also bright red, but the red is a different
tone: not so crimson I should say. Hubert D. Astley.
[The above description agrees with that of C. phceniceus in the
t By the way, as touching Mr. Townsend's prize winners, the question is not how they
look now, but, if they live, how will they look six or seven years hence ? A.G.B.

<bodyText confidence="0.993944210526316" page_id="32720749"  page_num="292" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I wonder if you would very kindly give me some advice about
our Cockatoo, which we have had for eleven years. Until now we have
believed it to be a cock bird, but, after being very restless and playful all the
evening, she suddenly to our very great surprise laid an egg, and now seems
anxious to sit on it at the bottom of the cage. Could you tell me if it
would be the slightest use for us to get a cock bird and turn them out into
an aviary. She is of the Great Sulphur species, and we brought her from
Australia ourselves eleven years ago, aud she was then supposed to be
three years old.
I have also got a pair of Japanese Painted Quails, and the hen has
been sitting for thirteen days. If she should be lucky enough to hatch
out any young birds is there any special food the}&apos; should have ? These
birds I brought over from Australia just a year ago myself.
I have got a Gouldian sitting on three eggs, and she had just hatched
out one bird, but the cold last night has killed her, and I am sorry to say
my other three Gouldians look sickly owing to this sudden cold, so lam
giving them heat again to-night. As they were bred in this aviary last
October I did not like to remove them now.
Margaret A. Feieding.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Feilding :--
All depends upon the strength of the aviary : for, as Mr. Wiener said
in our Magazine in 1S96--" The larger kind (of Cockatoos) are so powerful
that nothing but steel bars and cast iron seems able to resist their beaks."
Undoubtedly you would require wire as strong as that used in the manu-
facture of Parrot-cages.
A barrel with a good-sized hole bored at one end for entrance would
be a suitable breeding receptacle.
In choosing a male, select a bird with darker eyes than your bird has.
P&apos;or feeding the young I should recommend boiled maize; but it is
possible, as with the Parralceets, that soaked bread squeezed as dry as
possible might answer the purpose. Mr. Meade-Waldo, who was the first
to breed the Chinese Painted Quail supplied them with living ants'eggs
and maw-seed, and they also had seeds of weeds; Mr. Seth-Smith I think
gives yolk of egg in addition.
It is odd that your Gouldian Finches should have suffered from the
cold: the night frosts (which one certainly does not expect to see in the
middle of May) have not affected mine, but they have not yet attempted
to breed. Our member Mr. Page keeps his birds in an outdoor aviary all

hardy. A. G. BuTpER.

Sir,--T he following may be of interest to those studying African
birds.
I was out last week looking for nests on the islets and sandbanks at
the mouth of the Atbara River. There were a number of Egyptian Plovers
about, and I was anxious to obtain a clutch of eggs, so recollecting a recent
note of Mr. A. E. Butler's in The Ibis that this bird buries its eggs under
the sand I started scratching up the sand at any places where there were a
number of their tracks or in any little hollows. From one of the latter,
under about a quarter-of-an-inch of sand I drew a three-parts-grown
Egyptian Plover ! I do not know if this has ever been recorded before,
and shall be glad to hear if any other birds are known to do similarly.
El Darner, Soudan, 20/5/06. W. G. Percivap.
A FIGHTING PENNANT PARRAKEE&apos;I.
Sir, --The behaviour of a Pennant Parrakeet in my possession is so
unusual as to seem almost worth recording in these pages. I bought him
about eight months ago ; he had evidently been a cage bird of long stand-
ing by the length of liis claws, some of which were curled round to look
like " split rings." He showed no fear of anything or anybody from the
first, though he could scarcely be called " tame," as he was extremely
spiteful. The extent of this spitefulness, however, we did not recognise
until about a month ago when he was turned into an indoor aviary. In
order to get him strong on the wing, before encountering the rough com-
pany of an aviary of Parrakeets, he was placed in an enclosure with a
beautiful Port Lincoln (also newly acquired), a few Barbary Doves, and a
couple of baby Blackbirds. From the first he has spent all his time in
"going for us" all round. As soon as we enter he dashes at us, settles on
our heads and tears our hair (if we venture in bare-headed) and bites most
viciously. He flies for our feet, shakes our dresses, whistling most charm-
ingly the while, between angry "chortling." He takes no heed happily of
the poor little Blackbirds, they are quite beneath his notice, otherwise he
would soon finish them off. He occasionally tears a beakful of feathers out
of the Doves, when there is nothing better to do, and of course he worries
the Port Lincoln from morning to night; but Port Lincoln is strong and
swift on the wing, so I do not interfere. But even that is poor sport, he
says. "What he likes best are great big humans!"
Until quite lately he has been chased and caught up in a net every
night, for I dared not leave him out in this exposed aviary during such
weather as we have been having. He has also been held in gloved hands,
while others cut these "split-ring", claws,--biting, struggling, and scream-
ing the while--what a job it was! One would have thought all this would

have given him pause ; but uo, as soon as he was liberated he would return
to the charge. An aviarist of twenty-six years standing I must have had
hundreds of Parrots in my time, but never had one show fight in an aviary
before. The neatest approach has been an old Rosy Cockatoo, which has
been in the aviary eighteen years, he -will on occasions, when not too lazy,
spread his wings, erect his crest, dive down his head, and scream at us when
we enter, but that is all. If this termagant were a Cockatoo his behaviour
would not be so surprising, but in a member of the stately and unemotional
Platycercus it is unaccountable.
Like the rest of his kind my Pennant is inclined to nibble his
feathers; it is remarkable that these birds, almost without exception, in-
dulge in this dreadful habit. I have had them while at large in an aviary
(so it was not due to boredom) denude themselves of every feather within
their reach, leaving only the long flights and tail feathers, a self torture to
which they ultimately succumbed. They are so nearly allied to the
Rosella, which is not a feather eater at all, neither have been indeed any
other of the Parrot tribe I have ever possessed. What is the reason of this
shocking propensity in this&apos; particular Parrakeet I should much like to
know.
The subject of this " note " amuses us very much, ami we are very
fond of him for his beauty and braver}&apos;, but when the novelty of his conduct
has worn off, and he is turned into the aviary proper, he will be nothing
short of a nuisance unless he mends his ways. We like to go in frequently
and stay long, where hitherto we have been always welcomed by the
inmates, or at least courteously received. E. A. II. HarTeey.

THE VIOLET-EARED WAXBILL.
Granaiina granatina.
(Cat. B. Brit. Mus. XIII., p. 403.)
By Reginald Phiijjpps.
It is with an unwilling pen that I write this little paper,
for I have not had opportunity of fully studying the nature of
the species; and there are a few points which need further
observation before they can be regarded as settled or even
reasonably established.
The Violet-eared Waxbill is not a new bird, for it is
known to have been a visitor to Europe a full century and a
half ago. Every body knows it by name, every body wants to
possess it I am told--and, if there should be anybody who has
not seen a stray specimen at the Palace or elsewhere, at any rate
every body who has the smallest pretensions in the world to be
called any body is receiving a pretty (at least I hope so--I have
not seen it) picture of a pair with the present issue of the
Avicultural Magazine. Moreover, now that South Africa is
being so generally visited by Britishers, the living bird is becom-
ing less and less uncommon in this country. If it may not sound
altogether too profane to say so, such numbers are coming over
at the present time that the Violet-eared Waxbill threatens to
become-- common ! ! !
There was a time, and not so long ago, when the state of
affairs was very different, when an example was so rarely seen
that to obtain possession of one seemed to be a moon far beyond
the reach of an ordinary individual like myself and for which
one might cry and cry and cry in vain, when the price demanded
was for many of us impossible ; and so when, a few years back.

Mr. R. Philupps,
some of us who had been waiting waiting, patiently but fruit-
lessly, year after year, for a Violet-eared Waxbill to come our
way were startled, nay, absolutely shocked, to hear that one of
our members in Madeira (O.S. III., p. 151) had been obtaining
without apparent difficulty several pairs from passing ships for
a song, whilst we could not obtain a single living specimen
either for a song, for love, or for money.
However, it is a long lane that has no turning ; and so it
came about that, early in 1902, an energetic member of the
Society swooped down upon South Africa, espied a pair of these
Waxbills in an aviary at Durban, promptly secured them by the
unromautic method of thrusting his hands somewhat deeply into
his trousers' pockets, and, 011 May 26th of that year, presented
them to me--for a consideration. Here were the Violets at last;
but disappointment accompanied success, for the female was sickly
and shortly died : presumably the journey had been too much
for her ; and so from that time until September of last year I was
left with the one solitary male. On September 5th, 1905, how-
ever, I received a really good female, and two days later a pair--
all fresh arrivals from South Africa ; and thus for the time being
I was the more or less happy possessor of two pairs of this
coveted species.
Books certainly do tell awful fibs about birds; and when
one book starts a fib a-rolling there is no stopping it--it is
trundled on from book to book and goes on rolling right merrily.
Granted that the Violet-eared Waxbill can be very tame, granted
that it can be very attractive, granted that it has many desirable
qualities--but if you are wise you will not take it for granted
that it is naturally peaceful and amiable. The bird is very
deceptive in this connection. At certain seasons when you see
them squatting or feeding with other little birds, neither
quarrelling nor wrangling, not standing up for their rights, even
allowing themselves to be hunted by smaller species, scarcely
troubling to move out of the way while their cage is being
attended to, it is natural that one should form certain opinions;
and in this lies the kernel of the mischief. Most of us are too
fond of founding opinions upon too limited experiences and
giving them forth as established facts, like newspaper touts who,

in their reckless hurry to be five seconds ahead of their rivals in
proclaiming to the world that the King of the Cannibal Islands
has got a tooth-ache, send a wire to head-quarters one day which
has to be contradicted on the next by the announcement that it
is not tooth-ache his sable majesty is suffering from but only an
ordinary surfeit from too liberal indulgence in " long-pig." 4 &apos; If I
have erred in this direction in the present paper, Mr. Editor is
alone to blame.
I will not go so far as to say that the Violet-eared Waxbill
is as wanting in amiability as the Crimson Finch, but at some
seasons there is not much to choose between the two. When in
the garden aviary my old male, although without a mate of his
own species, seemed to be always persecuting some other bird,
now one now another, hunting it unceasingly. Last winter, in a
six-foot cage in my dining-room, my four Violet Ears were no
better. With a single peck one of them killed a Cuba Finch
which inadvertently had approached too near ; and after the two
pairs had been together some four months, each pair keeping to
its own end of the cage, and an armed neutrality having
apparently been established, each male being so strong that I
thought them quite capable of taking care of themselves in so
large a place (I had kept them together, at first also with other
birds, as I did not wish them to nest), one morning a male was
deliberately and brutally murdered ; and the widow had to be
instantly removed to save her from a like fate. And the females,
between themselves, are little better, and on several occasions
have had to be caged separately. Roughly speaking, during the
off season or seasons Violet-eared Waxbills may be more or less
quiet, especially if there be a lot of birds together--for in a way
it is a timid species. On the other hand, the more fit and keen
a pair may become for nesting the less reliable will their tempers
be. For a time it may be safe to have more than one of each sex
in the same place, but it is not a state of affairs that can be relied
upon to last; and the unpleasant part is that they seem to be so
uncertain, so treacherous. There is little or no actual fighting;
if ill-matched the stronger will chase the weaker, the old bird

Mr. R. Phillipps,
the new comer, sometimes regularly sometimes intermittently ; if
they do not chase one another, it is probably because they are
equally matched. But they are only biding their time; when
opportunity offers there is murder swift and sure, the murderer
boring his sharp pointed beak into the brain of his victim. A
snap of cold weather seems to cool their tempers more effectually
than anything else.
A pair of Violet-eared Waxbills, in a large cage by them-
selves, will become exceptionally confiding for seed-eaters, and,
when the sun is shining upon the male, he is certainly a beautiful
bird. In the blaze of the sun the colours come out in resplen-
dent glory--the bright lilac of the side-face, the rich blue of the
forehead and tail-coverts, the deep black chin and upper throat,
the varying shades of the chestnut body, the brilliant bronze
(not mentioned in the Museum Catalogue nor in any work to
which I have access--does it pass away with life?) of the outer
aspects of the closed flights, the red eye, the coral beak, all so
remarkably set off and shewn to the best advantage by the long
trim tight slender symmetrical figure --a good male in the sun is
simply exquisite. The female, also, is not without her charms,
and both keep their feathers well. Moreover, for a foreign
species, although greatly the better for warmth, and unable to
stand much cold, the male at least cannot be called especially
delicate although the female may be less robust; I regard the
species as unquestionably hardier than the Crimson Finch. But
I cannot agree with the common statement that it is hardy.
Because a bird does not die right away does not prove in the
smallest degree that it is hardy. It is tenacious of life, but the
germs of disease may be none the less eradicably sown. The
Violet Ear, too, is deceptive, for a dying bird when approached
will brace itself up and look brisk and tight; leave it alone and
watch from a distance, and the poor creature will turn into a
sleeping ball in a trice.
Another strong point in favour of the Violet Ear is that it
has a real song and a very sweet one too. During the winter, I
mean the English winter, the song is repeatedly uttered ; and
being soft and low, even soothing, it could not irritate the most
excitable nerves. And the females will often sing, though their

song is not so full nor well sustained. They sing best when
without a male of their own species ; but more than once I have
seen a female, with a piece of hay in her bill, dancing and
singing to the male. In the garden aviary during the summer,
for these birds are incomparably the better for a change to the
garden during the warm season, my old male always used to sing
away ; and then the low-voiced song, floating softly on the air,
often reminded me of our Skylark warbling so sweetly high up
in the heavens. My present birds do not now seem to be in song ;
one has to learn by experience; and I think my experiences, so
far as they go, have taught me that it was a great mistake on my
part to have allowed them to go to nest in the spring ; but more
of that anon.
Notwithstanding little infirmities of temper, it may be
gathered from the foregoing that the Violet-eared Waxbill is a
desirable acquisition. It is not everyone who can manage to
have an aviary (by " aviary " I mean " aviary " not a toy--it is
my custom to say what I mean and to mean what I say) ; but
any one who desires to have a pet which will give a minimum of
trouble and a great deal of pleasure will do well to try a pair of
these birds in a large cage, the larger the better. Although
probably young would not be reared, a pair are infinitely prefer-
able to a solitary male. They seem to do well on the simplest
seeds, which should include spray millet; fine grit should not be
overlooked, nor a bath in warm weather. I do not see them
touching cuttle-bone, but they seem to have a decided weakness
for old lime. They prefer to feed on the ground, the most
natural mode, so the bottom of the cage should be carefully
attended to every day; and the seed should be scattered on the
ground in a spot above which there is no perch. Doubtless
flowering grass in season would be a great treat. In the aviary I
see them partaking freely of lettuce; but never forget that a bird
in the aviary may freely devour green food which might surely
kill the very same bird if kept in a cage. This is one of those
ugly facts which is apt to be lost sight of. It is not, as a rule, a
fidgety restless species, so that, if there be but the one pair and
the cage not too small, the mess made outside the cage is usually
nominal. In the winter the cage, if not a box cage, would have

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
to be covered entirely, excepting the front, with green baize or
other warm material, with a flap to fall partially over the front at
night, care being taken in regard to ventilation, and the bottom
being left open to allow light to fall upon the food. If kept in a
living room with a fire burning all the day, it is not unlikely
that further warmth would not be needed. Of course the more
the birds are spoken to the more companionable they will be-
come, and, generally speaking, the more sun they have the
better.
The male has various call-notes, some loud and the reverse
of melodious but more often uttered in the garden than in the
house, such as " squee," " sish," " squwish "--perhaps a call
uttered by a single male for a mate, but not always so; and when
a pair in a cage are restless, apparently wanting to get out and
breed, it is a low but oft-repeated " tsit."
Although strong on the wing and rapid flyers, and
anything but ground birds, they are much on the ground ; and
thus it is that, when dancing to one another, or the one to the
other, perhaps invariably with something in the bill held at one
end after the approved Waxbill fashion, they often dance on the
ground, and so are able to go round and round one another in
movable circles. In the aviary, the top of a shed or any flat
place will be made use of for this purpose, perhaps in preference
to the ground. When flying short distances, the noise made by
the wings is often very considerable.
At what season should we try to get this species to breed ?
At what season should they moult? I should like to have had
time for studying these two points, as they are important in
themselves, and others hang upon and are influenced by them.
Coming from South Africa, where the summer is our
winter and the winter our summer, the Violet Ear in the British
Islands should be desirous of breeding during our winter; and
from November to March, or thereabouts, it seems to be dead set
on breeding. It may not, however, be permitted to breed in the
cold aviary during the winter; and it is not a species which
seems disposed to rear young in a confined space. The winter
breeding impulse passing off thus comparatively early in the
year, there is reasonable ground for strong hope that, after the

spring moult, it should prove to be an easy species to breed in
the garden aviary during our summer or early autumn--before
the autumnal moult in fact. And so far as I have been able to
observe of my mateless male during a few summers, I am of
opinion that a good pair under favourable conditions would breed
and rear young without any trouble whatever ; but the larger the
aviary the greater the chances of success--if there be a sufficiency
of shelter, not too many other birds, and a complete abstention
from nest-peeping. I would suggest that they be kept snugly
housed until well into June, occasionally even later, before being
transferred to the garden aviary, if an exposed one--one can
speak only generally. Although more or less ready to breed
every summer, I notice that my old male was never so fit and
keen as he was during the month of July (1904) ; and probably
we shall do well to aim at getting our birds into condition by
mid-June. But please note that the more I watch and consider
the more strongly I feel that, if we are to have a successful
summer breeding, the winter breeding must be absolutely
stopped: during the winter segregate the sexes, if possible
placing them out of sight and hearing of one another.
These Waxbills seem to be rather indifferent (in a sense)
to their surroundings, and ready to adapt themselves to circum-
stances ; they are not shy nesters and will nest prett}&apos; nearly
anywhere--but nesting is not breeding. I am not very hopeful
about my own birds as I have marred my chance, at any rate for
this year, by weakly giving in and allowing them to nest in the
spring; and my aviary is exposed, and I fear that wet and cold
may be too much for the breeding birds, and especially for the
young as, after leaving the nest, they are almost certain to keep
to the trees and shrubs. Nevertheless there are now such a
number of Violet Kars about the country that it will be strange
if there be no successful breeding before the winter. The winter
nesting of my pair proved a failure as stated on page 204. The
nest consisted of hay and a few feathers carelessly arranged in a
sloping and open log-nest. Dead grasses pulled up by the birds
themselves, or soft hay, and small feathers, seem to be all that
they desire or require.
Concerning the nest, Stark tells us ( The Fauna of South

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
Africa , Birds, I., p. 105)--" A nest taken in June, in the Northern
Transvaal, was built about four feet off the ground in a thorny
bush. It is round in shape, with a side entrance, and is loosely
constructed of dry grass lined with a few feathers. The eggs,
three in number, are pure white and measure 0.72 x 0.50. It is
somewhat curious that this delicate-looking little bird should
breed in mid-winter,when the nights are decidedly cold, but I have
frequently noticed the seeming indifference of many of the South
African small birds .... to temperature. Many breed in mid-
winter .... Not unfrequently the same species will nest again
in the height of summer." Ret not any unwary Britisher think
from the above that he may with impunity expose his Violet-
eared Waxbills to the cold wet and chill raw damp of our cold
season. I desire again to draw especial attention to this point as
on more than one occasion my old male, when passing the
summer and autumn in the aviary, displayed serious symptoms
of having had too much " fresh air," which subsided, but perhaps
the cause was never wholly eradicated, after a little coddling
in a small well-covered cage in my dining-room. The earliest
symptoms of there being anything amiss with these birds that I
have been able to detect is an undue desire to sleep. As I have
already inferred, it does not die off in a hurry, but holds on to
life right well, thus gaining a reputation for hardiness that it
does not possess.
I think we shall not be justified in assuming from the above
that this species usually breeds in June in the wild state. It is
unlikely, and the supposition is emphatically negatived by the
behaviour of my birds ; and only one solitary nest is mentioned
as having been found. All the same it is comforting for us to
learn that the Violet-eared Waxbill is so far superior to prejudices
and conventionalities as not to be above breeding in the month of
June should it suit its convenience to do so. South Africa is a
large place with diversities of land and climate, and the bird
may behave differently in different Districts. The statement that
" the same species will nest again in the height of summer" is
no proof that the same individual birds ever nest both in the
winter and in the summer.

clutches of four eggs each, one of two and another of three,
all laid in cages : also (p. 183) one of two eggs and another
number unknown laid in aviaries, one young bird having been
hatched, but not reared, on the last occasion. Mrs. Vivian in
Portugal mentions (N.S. II., p. 174) two clutches of two each,
the eggs being pure white, about the size of those of Gouldians.
Mrs. Reid's birds (several pairs) commenced to lay in the month
*of February, Mrs. Vivian's in January. Mrs. Reid tells us that,
in one instance when they sat during the day but not at night,
the female and the male bird took turns at sitting, and relieved
each other with the greatest regularity through the day. The
*species, although so accommodating up to a certain point,
persistently draws a hard and fast line somewhere--in my
opinion they are unwilling to breed seriously except in a quiet
and retired place free from intrusion and disturbance.
My old male, from time to time, took up with various
females of different species--if he could not get the one he
wanted he would make up to any one he could get. His
favourite was the White-eared Grassfinch I have more than once
*(p. 234) referred to. She had been long enough in this country
to appreciate the comforts of a snug sleeping-box in our cold
uncertain climate. The Waxbill did not approve of such a
deviation from the ancient traditions of the Violet Ears and for
a considerable time slept outside and not inside with her; but
little by little he conquered his prejudices and eventually roosted
regularly inside the box. I noticed that from the time he had a
mate of his own species he ceased to sleep under cover, although
he freely carried nesting materials to a log, and that both birds
preferred to roost outside on the top of a box in a rather dark
corner. Perhaps this disinclination to sleep in anything of the
form of a box may be at the root of the refusal of Mrs. Reid's
Violet-eared Waxbills to incubate their eggs until, on the last
occasion noted, they had built a proper domed nest of their
own.
And how about the moult of our Violet friends ? Do they
naturally moult twice in the year or only once, and, if once, at
what season ? On October 19 last, when I had four of these birds,
I made the note--"There has been a lot of moulting lately" ;

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
but I do not know whether all four were moulting or only some
of them. This is unfortunate, but I regarded the occurrence as
an ordinary autumnal moult and made few notes; though I
certainly was of opinion at the time that there was a more or less
general moult going on amongst the whole party. These birds,
at any rate with me, never tell you that they are moulting, the
cast feathers and an untidy face for a couple of days being the
only outward signs--I have not yet had one that did not sport
quite a respectable tail all through the moult; close watching,
however, shewed that every feather was changed and quickly
too ; I have never seen a shabby Violet Ear. East autumn, one
was a young male that had been assuming the plumage of the
adult; his change of feather, at any rate of the small feathers,
was unquestionable, but it appeared to have been completed
prior to October 19, so some of the others must have been
concerned ; and the larger feathers were shed in abundance.
Of course the voyage and change of climate may have thrown
the birds out of order. This April-May, the surviving male and
the female that had not nested effected a complete moult of both
large and small feathers, and the other female moulted about two-
months later. On May 22 I received yet another male, a new
arrival, but it was not well, and for a time I failed to detect what
was wrong. It turned out that it was a case of suppressed moult,
the bird presumably having had a chill or check somewhere on
the voyage ; so, if I am not confusing cause and effect, here we
have a case of a bird fresh from South Africa that had a spring
(English) as those which reached this country last September
appear to have had an autumnal moult.
All these incidents seem to point strongly to the natural
breeding season of this species being during our winter, and to
the breeding season being duly followed by a complete change
of feather in our spring. As regards our autumnal moult, we
must just wait and watch. The nest found in June (the South
African winter) by Stark, and as already pointed out he mentions
only one nest, may have been an accidental occurrence, or a
case of different localities different seasons; and it would
naturally follow that a pair breeding in June would moult
toward September--October.

Our coloured plate sufficiently illustrates, I doubt not, the
plumage respectively of the adult male and female. Of the
young, Stark says :--" Like the female, but browner," and the
British Museum Catalogue :--" Similar to the old female but
almost entirely brown, rather tawny underneath." I have never
seen a quite young bird ; but the young male I received on
September 7 last was passing from the immature to the mature
feather and was then like the female but for the black throat,
some extra blue, and some dark splashes of chestnut on the breast.
It attained the full plumage of the adult a little previous to
October 19. In &apos;view of what I have seen stated elsewhere, I
must add that the male of this species does not go in and out of
colour like Weavers and Whydaks, but having once donned the
colours of the adult retains them to the end.
Distribution .--" From Griqualaud West and the Southern
Transvaal to the Zambesi River, the Lake Ngami District and
the Damara Land."
Stark also tells us that these Waxbills appear never to
congregate in large flocks, but are either met with in small
parties of five or six, or more usually in pairs. They keep, he
says, much to localities covered with low bushes, and especially
with scattered mimosas, and generally feed on the ground be-
tween the bushes, often on bare spots, on grass and other small
seeds. Captain Horsbrugh (N.S., II., p. 96) seems to infer that
they are naturally wilder or shyer than some of the other Wax-
bills, avoiding the haunts of man and keeping to the bush. To
me it seems that they are unsociable birds, both males and
females being unable to tolerate for any length of time the
presence near them of any other of the species of the same sex.
I have been told also that the reason why the Violet Ears are
difficult to obtain is that in the wild state they do not go about in
flocks but in pairs. Of course Stark's " small parties of five or
six " represent a pair with their latest brood. All this agrees
perfectly wdth the nature of the species so far as it has been
developed and displayed in my aviary. One feels disposed to
come to the conclusion that the Violet-eared Waxbill does not
go about in flocks,--and this view of the case is certainly
supported by Stark.

On the Violet-eared Waxbill.
A few days back, however, I found this conclusion rudely
traversed by a statement which appears in the latest issue, that
for June, 1906, of The Journal of the South African Ornithologists&apos;
Union. On pages 28 and 29 Dr. Edmond Symonds, a member of
the Union, in a paper on " Some Members of the Family Plo-
ceidse occurring in the Kroonstad District, Orange River Colony,"
writes of this species as follows :--" Some years these beautiful
birds are plentiful and found winter and summer in the bush
along the river and also at Rlienoster Kop, which is near here.
In other years not one is to be seen. I have never yet found
a nest; the boys do a large trade in catching them in trap-cages
and selling them, but they require a lot of care to keep them
safely through the winter. I have seen them in flocks of at
least fifteen to twenty, and they can be easily recognised by
the blue rump."
It is to be hoped that Captain Horsbrugh, who is now due
back in this country from South Africa, and who has also been
keeping them for some time, will give us the benefit of his
observations on the species at no distant date.
I have found the Violet-eared Waxbill to be endowed with
considerable intelligence, far above the average of birds of this
class.
In the garden it usually goes to roost late, often very
late ; and before doing so it not infrequently calls out lustily after
the manner of our Blackbird, and doubtless from the same cause
--cats and other marauders of the night.
After rain, it delights in flopping amongst the wet foliage
of trees and shrubs.
In print it is occasionally referred to as the Grenate Finch,
Grenadine Waxbill, Sec., but I have never heard it spoken of
otherwise than as the Violet-eared Waxbill, a simple name which,

Tympanistria tympanistria.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., &amp;c.
As stated in the Avicultural Magazine for October 1903 (p.
397) my pair of Tambourine Doves, in company with a hen
Emerald Dove, were brought over from South Africa by Mr.
T. E. Bonstow and presented to me in August 1902. Whether
this Emerald Dove belongs to the sub-species-- Chalcopelia chalco-
spila caffra , or is, as seems more probable, an unnamed form of
the species with larger and more emerald-coloured metallic spots
I do not know; it differs in a marked degree from Western
examples both in general outline and depth of colour, from C .
afra of course it is easily distinguished.
Up to November 1903, although many eggs were laid by
my hen Tympanistria , none were hatched either in the birdroom or
my larger garden aviary ; then one young one was hatched in
the birdroom and fed until nine days old when its parents
deserted it.
After 1903 and up to the present year no eggs have been
hatched by these birds; therefore, as I desired to give them every
opportunity, I again turned them out this spring into my lower
though longer outdoor aviary, having previously moulded a sort
of shallow basin of slender branches and twigs, at about four feet
from the cement floor, in the thicket of dead branches which
partly fills the more remote covered part of the aviary.
The birds were turned out 011 May 3rd and eggs were laid
in the nesting-site which I had prepared on June 6th and 8th,
the birds beginning to sit on the 8th, the cock turning the hen
off the nest and taking her place at 9.30 a.m. and the hen re-
turning to the nest at about 2.45 p.m.
On June 20th I found the first half-shell on the floor, and
on the following day the second half-shell was brought out, there
being just a day between the hatching of the two young birds.
That Tympanistria should have hatched out on this occasion on
the thirteenth morning, whereas in the considerably cooler bird-
room the egg hatched in 1903 took four days longer to incubate
was to me a matter of great interest.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
After the hatching of the second egg neither parent
appeared outside until 11.15 a.m., then the cock bird appeared,
the lieu not leaving the nest until the afternoon ; on the following
day however this arrangement was partially reversed, the hen
appearing early, but the cock not until 11.45.
I was so nervous about disturbing the doves when feeding
the young, that I did not dare to approach the back of the aviary
to discover how matters were prospering until July 3rd, when
being alarmed by noticing that the male was chasing the female
about and cooing in his strange fashion, I made up my mind to
look into things. I discovered that the nesting-site which I
had prepared had been but little altered and that it contained two
young birds of most singular appearance about the size of a full-
grown Sparrow, but with downy long hairs standing up all over
their heads between the sprouting feathers which also stood away
from the crown ; as compared with their parents they had a
very tawny appearance.

19 days old.
I described the colouring of the young when nine days old
( Avic. Mag., N.S., Vol. II., p. 101) and a lamentable accident
enabled me to describe and sketch the young when nineteen days
of age. On the 6th July the cock parent in a fit of exuberant
spirits flew so tempestuously over the nest that both of his chil-
dren sprang over the side to the cement floor. Unfortunately I
had not prepared for such an emergency by strewing hay over the
ground and the younger bird fell upon its back and was unable to
turn over, the other toddled away to the back of the thicket from

which I had a struggle to recover him. I replaced both birds in
the nest, and they appeared little worse for the adventure.
On the 8th the older and stronger nestling was again
prowling about the floor, therefore I did not trouble to disturb it;
the other still remained in the nest and seemed none the worse
for its fall, but on the 9th it was dead ; the following is the short
description which I made from it before forwarding it to the
Natural History Museum :--Colouring of upper parts largely
bronze-brown, but the feathers barred with buff and black;
flights reddish-chestnut; tail chiefly vinous brown, the outer-
most feathers white. Forehead and broad eyebrow-streak buff;
the feathers at sides of crown standing in curved rows so as to
produce a sort of divided crest, buff-brownish ; ear-coverts and
cheeks leaden grey, the former apparently narrowly barred
white and buff, but this appearance is probably partly due to the
sheaths still remaining 011 the feathers at this part of the head ;
sides of neck, throat and breast bufflsh-brown, with narrow
blackish bars ; abdomen white ; bill dull black ; feet dark leaden
grey with a faint sub-tint of flesh-colour : the eye was too sunken
to describe.
In his account of " Birds collected by Dr. W. E. Abbott in
the Kilimanjaro Region, East Africa" (Proc. Uu. States Nat. Mus.
Vol. XXVIII. p. 843) Prof. H. C. Oberholser describes the
immature Tambourine Dove compared with the adult as follows :--
" Upper surface of the body more rufesceut ; forehead greyish,
slightly tinged with tawny ; crown washed, the back and rump
barred, with rusty ; wing-coverts and secondaries duller, as well as
rather paler, with mottlings and some bars of dark brown and
tawnjr, the secondaries with a dark subterminal bar ; sides of the
head shaded with ashy and brownish ; anterior lower parts more
or less barred with dark brown and ochraceons ; lower tail-coverts
with tips and sometimes bars of tawny." This would probably be
an intermediate stage between the nestling and adult plumage.
After it had left the nest I, on several occasions, noticed
the young bird screaming to its mother for food and flapping its
wings, but I never saw her feeding it ; she used to run away into
the thicket of dead branches with the young one waddling after
her, but whether she fed it when out of sight from the other end

of the aviary I could not tell. From the 8th to the nth I passed
an anxious time, fearing each morning that I should find it dead
and imagining that it became gradually weaker and more un-
steady on its feet; on the nth however it looked so decidedly
stronger that I concluded that it had made up its mind to live;
it was still unable to fly, but moved tolerably rapidly even among
coarse grasses on a bank upon which it had mounted by means of
a sloping heap of sand ; when running upon more level ground
it greatly resembles a small duck and waddles much in the same
fashion, but when on perfectly smooth ground it runs more
evenly.
On the 12tli I saw the young bird fly six feet from the
bank, in the afternoon it seemed unable to walk and used its
wings to flap along the ground, when I went towards it however
it used both feet and wings to evade me. On the 13th the dove
was much stronger, and as I entered the aviary rose from the
ground and flew about twelve feet ; from this time there was
no relapse, and on the 17th I saw it with its parents at a seed-
pan placed on the floor for its convenience : I did not actually
see it eating, but the parents were not feeding it. Up to the
18th though active, it still remained much behind the dead
bushes : the feathering seemed to be perfect.
It would seem that, as compared with the Turtle-Doves
( Turtur ), the development of the nestling of Tympanistria is
remarkably slow; the presence of the loose downy hairs on the
head of the young when a fortnight old and the fact that when
nineteen days of age the feathers of the crown, wings and tail
had not half emerged from their sheaths, appears to me to be very
unusual, and it is positively disconcerting fora dove to be unable
to fly when three weeks old.
As there now seems every prospect of the second young
bird living, and this is the first instance, to my knowledge, in
which the Tambourine Dove has been bred to anything approach-
ing maturity in captivity, I see no reason for holding back my
account.
As is well known the eggs of Tympanistria , though
perhaps a trifle larger than those of the Emerald Dove are of the
same creamy white colour.

The Breeding of Humming Birds in Trinidad. 311
THE BREEDING OF HUMMING BIRDS IN
TRINIDAD.
By Collingwood Ingram, M.B.O.U.
In Trinidad Humming Birds appear to have no defined
season for nidification, and from what I gathered during my stay
in the island, nests may be found there at all times of the year.
Gosse, in his "Birds of Jamaica," also seems to doubt the
existence of a regular breeding season for these birds. It is
certainly a noteworthy fact that I observed a pair nesting near
Port of Spain in December, when the usual breeding season for
other species in Trinidad appears to be more or less similar to
that of Southern Europe, viz.: from about April to June, or even
later.
It was due to the courtesy of Lady Northcote that I was
able to inspect the nest above referred to. Of course it is well
known that during the breeding season certain species of Hum-
ming Birds frequently attempt to reproduce their kind in the
vicinity of human habitation. However, the site in this case was
a very remarkable one, and calls for a few words of description.
The nest was built on the bracket of a lamp hanging over the
door in the inner porch of Lady Northcote's charming residence.
The lamp contained a veiy brilliant electric light, which was
frequently turned on at night, when it shone full into the nest,
which was placed only a few inches below the globe. Under
these circumstances it was only natural for Lady^Hortlicote to
show a great interest in the domestic affairs of these confiding
little birds, and throughout their visit she closely observed their
habits. That she might better watch the progress of the family
she ingeniously arranged a mirror over the lamp, and this clearly
reflected the contents of the nest. I am indebted to her for the
following valuable notes which are of interest, as the}&quot; approxi-
mately show the time occupied in incubation. This appears to
have been extended over an unusually long period, for by the
dates given it must have lasted for at least seventeen days.
Perhaps this may be partially explained by the fact that the birds
were no doubt often frightened from the nest by the frequent use
of the front door. Mr. E. H. Evans in The Ibis{ 1S91, p. 64) gives
twelve and ten days for the two species of Humming Birds

It will be remembered that my attempt to cross this
species last year with the European Blackbird resulted in the
hatching of three young birds, of which only one was reared ; I
hoped and believed that this youngster would prove to be a cock
bird, but unfortunately it proves to be a hen ; in colouring it is
almost uniform olive-brown.
I left the two Blackbirds together in the outdoor aviary
throughout the winter, but they did not attempt to breed until
a heavy shower at length gave them some mud with which to
render their nest compact; this happened some time in May,
but the birds were so sly about their building, that I never
suspected what they were about until the nest was completed
upon the top of last year's structure.
O11 May 31st the hen began to sit and the cock immediately
commenced to persecute my pair of Australian Green-winged
Doves ; these would, I believe, have bred, only the cock Ouzel
kept driving them from pillar to post, so that I had no chance of
competing with our Editor ; but in any case I think his young
bird would have been first in the field.

Further Notes o?i the Grey-winged Ouzel. 313
On June 14th the first nestling must have hatched, as the
Ouzel began to break up worms and carry them up to the nest,
but it is evident that one or more hatched on the 15th, when I
found a half-shell on the floor of the aviary. From this date my
labours began ; we had a long spell of hot dry weather and I
had to keep up a constant supply of earthworms, beetle-larvae,
cockroaches, or any other insects I could get.* I had no
preserved yolk of egg, and the hard-boiled egg in the soft food
which I supply to these birds every morning was all picked out
and carried to the young as soon as the pan was placed in the
aviary ; it was no use for me to say " I cannot dig, to beg I am
ashamed," I had to do both : I dug up worms in every bare
patch, and I begged worms of my neighbours ; I was determined
that this year I would not lose two out of three of my young
birds for the lack of worms.
In the past I have worked hard when hand-rearing birds,
tumbling out of bed at 6 a.m. to feed, and attending to them
every hour until 8 or 9 p.m. ; but fora man of sixty-two summers
to have to dig, and dig deep, at all hours of the day in hot
weather in order to rear three young hybrid Blackbirds is indeed
penal servitude.
I did not hear much of the young birds until June 22nd,
when they were distinctly audible when fed. The note in the
nest is quite dissimilar from the call for food after they have
flown ; it is a sort of rattling trill, whereas the hungry youngster
calling its parents cries--" chick er"
On the 29th three young birds left the nest ; whether the
violent storm and heavy rain of the previous night hurried them
I cannot say, but at any rate all three were well-feathered and
very like young Thrushes in appearance. So far as I could
guess, and I did guess again although I was wrong last year, I
thought they looked like one cock and two hens; I hope it will
be the other way round.
The cock Grey-winged Ouzel would take worms from my
fingers (I don't like handling them, but one has to get
accustomed even to picking up spiders and cockroaches when
A lot of living ants' eggs (large female cocoons) which I found one day were eaten by
the cock bird ; lie took none to the young.

one keeps birds), but the hen Blackbird kept under cover and
dodged out surreptitiously and snatched the prize from her
husband when he was off his guard. It may perhaps be of
interest to mention that one evening we dug up over 150 worms,
fully a third of which were of full growth measuring six or seven
inches in length, and in about three days all had been devoured ;
think then of the millions which a flock of Starlings must
destroy every season when nesting ; though to anyone who has
watched the vast clouds of Starlings which assemble in the late
summer, darkening the air, as they pass over with a sound like
the muttering of distant thunder, it is unthinkable.
By the 2nd of June the young birds could fly strongly ;
but throughout the day they could be heard far more often than
seen; they spent a good deal of time under the shelter of the
large ferns in the aviary, only occasionally roosting on a low
branch; but towards evening they got up on a ledge, from which
I had to dislodge them as I feared lest some hungry cat might
spring at the wire and perchance wound them with its claws.
So far there seems every prospect of this batch of Ouzels
being successfully reared, in which case it will be possible to see
how far the young male will reproduce the grey on wings and
flanks of Merida boidboid. Breeding hybrids is interesting, but
not easy; and I don't think my Blackbirds will spend another
year in my larger garden aviary ; they quite monopolize it.
THE LATE MR. AUGUST F. WIENER.
It is with very great regret that we have to announce the
death, which took place on July 5th, of our esteemed Vice-
President.
Although for some years past Mr. Wiener had not kept
many birds, yet some twenty-five or thirty 3&apos;ears ago he had
probably the finest collection of rare foreign finches in England,
and long before this he practised aviculture extensively on the
Continent. He was a friend of the late Dr. Karl Russ, and a
contributor to his paper Die Gefiederte Welt , and he wrote an
obituary notice of that great German aviculturist in this journal

(Old Series, Vol. VI. p. 79). He was the author of the portion
of Cassell's Canaries and Cage Birds which dealt with foreign
birds, which was far in advance of anything previously published.
That Mr. Wiener never lost an atom of his intense love of
birds, and especially of the smaller foreign finches is shown by
his frequent communications published in our magazine; in fact
up to the time of his death he kept a few Gouldians and other
small finches in his drawing room. His recent articles and
letters on the subject of " Cages versus Aviaries " must be fresh
in the memory of every member of our society.
Mr. Wiener was a member of the Council of the Zoological
Society and of the Garden Committee, and a most regular
attendant at the Society's meetings, while his love of animals in
general was shown by his very frequent visits to the Zoo. when
he almost invariably carried a bag full of good things for the
animals, and it was wonderful to see how the majority of them
knew him well.
Mr. Wiener was one of the kindest and most good-natured
of men, and will be very greatly missed by the large circle of
ornithologists and others who knew him intimately and appre-
ciated his solid worth.--D. S-S.

The Bi-Annual Meeting of the Council was held, by the
kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Bonhote at Gadespring
Dodge, Hemel Hempstead, on July 7th. Notable was the
absence of Mr. Aug. F. Wiener, our late Vice-President, whose
death occurred before&apos;the meeting. A message of condolence
to his family was unanimously voted in which it was felt that all
members would have been glad to join.
The principal business of the meeting consisted in the
nomination of candidates for office next year. The names of
those recommended by the Council will, in accordance with the
Rules of the Society, be published in the September number of
the Magazine.
Professor Giocinto Martorelli, of Milan, was elected as an
Honorary Member in place of the late Canon Tristram.
The Kditor proposed that in future Members' advertise-
ments should be accepted up to the 26th of the month instead of
the 19th as at present, and that the charges be slightly raised ;
and it was agreed that in future the charge for "sales" adver-
tisements should be sixpence for eighteen words or less, and one
penny for every additional three words; while in the "wants"
column the charge should be fourpence for twelve words or less,
and one penny for every additional three words ; advertisements
to reach the Editor not later than the 26th of the month.
The Meeting terminated with votes of thanks to Mr.
Bonhote, and to Dr. Butler for occupying the chair.

Sir,--W ith regard to Mrs. Hartley's letter my experience is that
hand-reared Platycerci are very apt to be vicious, but I have looked upon it
as sexual. I thought it was confined to the males and that they would let
women handle them. Either Mrs. Hartley's is a fighting female, or the
cocks will go for either sex.
Dr. Butler will no doubt tell Mrs. Hartley that her Pennants' feather
plucking is the result of sop. I should like to ask, Is it feather eating or
feather picking? I have had birds which eat feathers, and I always think
there is something in the food--some form of insect food, probably that
they lack. Pennants wild may have a different diet to Rosellas.

IS THE GOULDIAN FINCH POLYGAMOUS ?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984895" page_id="32720780"  page_num="317" year="" vol="">
Sir,--A t the commencement of the breeding-season I fixed up five
straw-hats upon the back wall of my smaller outdoor aviary ; and, among
other birds, I turned out one pair of Poephila gouldice and one hen of the
variety first named P. mirablis. The male P. gouldice and the female P.
mirablis were the pair from which I bred in the same aviary last year, and
they took possession of the same old hat as a nesting receptacle.
About a week ago I heard young birds being fed in this hat, but was
surprised to see the cock bird examining the others: I supposed that he
was trying to deceive me as to the location of the nest.
This morning the same thing occurred ; but, to my surprise there
appeared to be young in the nesting-receptacle to the right of the first nest,
the cock bird repeatedly put his head in through the opening, and there
was a distinct sound of nestlings being fed: shortly afterwards the hen P.
gouldice visited the same hat, so that I was forced to the conclusion that
both hens must have young.
After feeding, the cock bird went to each of the five hats, putting his
head into the entrance-hole and pretending to feed ; but I only heard
sounds of young from the two visited by the liens. If there are young in
any of the other hats they can only be hybrids, for it is hardly likely that a
hen Gouldian finch would lay and hatch a second time before the young of
the first nest had flown, though if the latter always develop as slowly as my
last year's nestlings it seems not impossible.
There is a pair of Yellow-rumped Finches in the same aviary, neither
of which I have seen for the past week: but they were very health}&apos; so that
I should hardly tliiuk they can have died leaving orphans to the care of
P. gouldice. A. G. Butter.

Sir, --I read a statement in the Magazine last autumn that it was
proposed to turn out some Pekin Robins in the London Parks. I have since
learned that some of these birds were seen there in the late autumn, but I
should be glad to know if the}&apos; have survived the winter, and if anything
has been seen of them in the spring or summer.
I have sometimes thought that more Parrakeets and other foreign
birds than we at present have might live out of doors in our climate, if
they were treated as I have seen them treated in India. At Jeypoor I have
seen long boxes of seed and other food for Parrots placed outside the
houses, where these wild birds come and feed just as our Pigeons do in
London.
Dr. Butler writes me that he should like to see some Zebra-finches
turned out in Devonshire and Cornwall; but that they would require to be
fresh-imported birds. Are you aware whether the experiment has ever been
tried? If anyone would undertake to see that they were properly fed and
looked after for a time I should be pleased to contribute towards the ex-
pense, as I take great interest in the introduction of foreign birds into this
country. &apos; William B. Gibbins.
[The acclimatization of foreign birds into this country is a subject of
very great interest, but one that requires great care and forethought. We
all know the harm that has been done by the introduction of the Rabbit
and Sparrow into Australia and New Zealand, but in these cases animals from
northern latitudes were liberated into countries where the temperature is
much warmer, and hence these prolific creatures have not even the cold of
winter to check their increase, but have a continuous breeding season.
The introduction of tropical or semi-tropical species into a climate
like ours would be a very different matter, and it seems to us most im-
probable that the smaller species, such as the Pekin Robin or any of the
smaller foreign finches, would have any chance against the hardy prolific
Sparrow which has already ousted many of our more desirable native
species. In the case of Parrakeets, it seems to us that the experiment
would be a dangerous one to try, for if they ever became abundant they
would do a great amount of damage to growing crops and vegetation.
We see no possible objection however to the introduction of some of
the foreign Doves and Pigeons into the London Parks, and there seems to
be no reason why they should not do very well indeed.
At Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire the Duke of Bedford has large
numbers of both the Australian Crested Pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes) and the
Bronze-winged Pigeon (P/iaps chalcoptera ) in his woods. His Grace informs
us that he has no absolute evidence that the latter species has bred but
there seems every reason to suppose that it has, while the former lias in-
creased in numbers considerably. Why should not these two hardy and

very beautiful Pigeons be introduced into the London Parks, where they
should do as well as the Woodpigeons have done ?
In the above letter Mr. Gibbins kindly offers to help in such an ex-
periment, and if others would do so we would be very willing to see that it
was carried out properly. The birds could be obtained next autumn or
winter, and we have the authority of the Secretary of the Zoological
Society for stating that they could be housed and attended to in the
Zoological Gardens until the early spring, when they would be liberated,
and during the ensuing summer they would doubtless breed iuthe trees
in the Park.
If our members consider the idea a good one we should be pleased to
receive subscriptions towards this object, which would be acknowledged in

Sir, --The attached cutting from the 'Selby Express,' dated July 6th,
may be worthy of note. Archibald Simpson.
"Curiosity in Natural History.--A cock pheasant was recently
found by Mr. Boscombe, keeper at Staynor Wood, sitting on a nest and
brooding the eggs. These he eventually hatched, and went off with the
chicks. That such a polygamous bird as the pheasant should sit would in
itself be a very remarkable occurrence, bnt that he should afterwards go off
with the chicks makes it still more extraordinary."

Sir, --So far as the present season has gone I have been very
fortunate in the rearing of Quails. As recorded in last month's issue a

grown and the two cocks in almost full colour. On the 8th of July a hen
Australian Stubble-Quail ( Coturnix pectoralis ) hatched off a brood of seven
chicks, all of which are doing well, and now about half-grown ; while on
July 19th, the hen C. delegorguei hatched her second brood, this time
numbering seven, one of which was a weakling and died before leaving the

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, Lanherne, Bexley Heath, Kent, and must be
accompanied by a letter containing- the fullest particulars of the case, and a fee
of i/- for each bird. If a reply by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed
Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries can only be reported on by post.
Green Cardinal Hen. (Mr. Moerscliell). Your bird died of heart
failure. The heart as all other parts of the body were loaded with
fat. At this time of the j^ear I should stop the hemp and sunflower
seed. The latter I do not like at any time although the birds are
very fond of it.
Mannikin. (Miss G, Wolfe). Bird died of apoplexy.
Cordon Bleu. (Miss Hamilton). Concussion of brain was cause of death,
having struck point of bill against some hard object.
ROSELLA Parrakeet. (Mr. Wilmot). Your bird had received an injury
to skull sometime previous to death. There was an extravasation on
the brain iwhicli was not of recent date. Possibty it was done when
you caught the bird up to cage it or when he was fighting the
cockatiel.
Red-headed Love Bird, cock. (Mrs. Ffoulkes). Died of fractured skull
caused by direct injury.
Yellow-collared Parrakeet. (Mrs. Williams). Died of fatty degener-
ation of the liver. The only cause I can ascribe is want of exercise.
I think you will be more successful if 3'ou kept your Parrakeets in
large outdoor aviaries. I found most of the Parrakeets quite hardy,
and have kept very many out of doors during the winter, and they
have done better than those caged.
Rosella Parrakeet. (Mr. Wilson). The bird died of concussion of the
brain caused bj r direct injury, most probably being frightened
flew against the wires.

THE BURMESE COLLARED TURTLE-DOVE.
By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Before coming to the Collared Turtle-dove of Burma, it
will be necessary first of all to go a little into the history of the
Collared Turtle-dove of Asia. There is but one species, if we
exclude the little Ruddy Turtles of India and Burma, China,
etc., which are now generally placed in a separate group, owing
to the difference in colour of the sexes, I think there are other
good reasons as well for keeping them distinct, but I do not go
into that here.
This Turtle-dove ought to be of considerable interest to
Aviculturists, because it was for long considered to be the wild
ancestor of the familiar domestic Barbary Dove, with which how-
ever, as I shall point out later, it has nothing whatever to do.
First of all by what name must this dove be known ? In
1894 Von Othmar Reiser, brought out his Avifauna of the
Balkans, in the preparation of which he evidently consulted a
little known work by Johan von Frivaldsky, entitled " Balkanyi
Termeszettudomanyi Utazasrol, Budan, 1838," in which a
description and plate of a Turtle-dove are given which can only
refer to this bird. The name there bestowed is Columba decaocta.
Mr. Othmar Reiser pointed this out to Mr. Dresser, who published
the facts in the " Ibis," for 1903, pp. 89, 90. Frivaldsky's name
is the oldest one known, as Dinnseus' name Columba risoria , 1766,
refers to the domestic bird. As Frivaldsky founded his name on
a bird from the Balkan regions, this must be the typical locality ;
but the bird found from the Balkans through Turkestan, as far
as Yarkand is a particularly large form of this Turtle-dove,
which received the name of Turtur stoliczkce , Hume, "Stray

Mr. T. H. Newman,
Feathers," II., p.519 (1874). A description, accompanied by an
excellent coloured plate, is given in Sharpe's " Second Yarkand
Mission." Hume's name is of course only a synonym of
Frivaldsky's.
I have gone into the foregoing dry details because hitherto
no one seems to have pointed out that it is this big north-eastern
race which must be regarded as the typical form and not the
Indian bird which has persistently been confounded with
Linnaeus' 'risoria ' and so been held to have had that honour. If
local forms are to be separated, the Indian Collared Turtle must
be regarded as a sub-species of T. decaocta and for this form
Hodgson's name ' douraca ' founded on a bird from Dhourakha*
(Nepal) is available. This was not published till 1844, six years
after the appearance of Frivaldsky's work. The typical bird is
said to differ from the Indian form, by being much larger,
having a broader nucal collar more conspicuously edged above
and below with white, &apos;and more white on the outer tail feathers
and with the secondaries and their coverts a pale pearl grey.
As all these seem to be variable features, they are perhaps rather
slight evidence for separation, but taken altogether they differ-
entiate the two forms quite as much as is usual among local
races.
Having now got so far, viz.:--that the Asiatic Collared
Turtle rejoices in the name of Turtur decaocta, decaocta while its
representative from India is T. decaocta douraca, I will now
come to the bird from Burma, which I believe to be another and
hitherto unnoticed form, much more distinct and easily
recognisable than those already known.
On the 20th of October, 1896, three Turtle-doves were
received at the Gardens of the Zoological Society of London,
having been presented, along with a large collection of reptiles
by Mr. W. G. Bligh, who thus wrote about them (P.Z.S. 1896,
p. 783), " These reptiles were all obtained in the Minbu and
Mague districts of Upper Burmali." Both these places are
situated on the Irawady about Lat. 20. There seems no reason
to doubt that the Turtle-doves also came from here. One of
* I have not been able to find this place on the map, but the name ' douraca ' occurs
in a list of Nepalese birds, so I presume it is ill Nepal.--T. H. N.

on the Siamese Collared Turtle-Dove . 323
these birds, a male, lived right 011 to June of this year, when it
died and was most unfortunately so mutilated by rats that it was
impossible to preserve it, though I had particularly requested
that, whatever happened, its skin should be saved. I am told
that all three birds were just alike, though I never saw the other
two, but for the last two years or so I kept the survivor under
notice. I am fortunate enough to have an excellent coloured
drawing by Mr. Goodchild, drawn from the living bird soon after
my attention was called to it. I have also the only surviving
young one, a hen, bred from this particular bird, but as its
mother was a Half-collared Turtle-dove ( Turtur semitorquatus ),
the characteristics of its father are not reproduced.
My reason for thinking that the Collared Turtle of Burma
differs from the typical bird and its known representative, lies
in the fact that the Burmese bird possesses most remarkable
yellow rings of bare skin round its ej ? es, which are most
conspicuous in the living bird. I do not know any other Turtle-
dove of any species whatever that has yellow round the eye. I
had hoped to have been able to compare the plumage with birds
from India etc., which the lamentable destruction of the specimen
now renders impossible. I am informed by those who know the
Collared Turtle-dove well in India, where it is a common bird
and not uufrequently kept in cages, that there it has no such
yellow bare skin, in fact in this respect it seems to resemble the
domestic Barbary Dove. I have also looked up numerous
references, and in every case when the colour of the orbital skin
is given (excluding the two localities Burma and China,
mentioned below), it is described as " Dower eyelid slaty grey "
(this is the typical form from Yarkand) Scully, " Stray Feathers "
IV. p. 17S. "Orbital skin bluish white" (Eastern Bengal)
Cripps, " Stray Feathers," VII. p. 297, and again " Orbital skin
bluish white," (Ceylon), Degge " Birds of Ceylon," p. 702, also
" Orbital skin whitish" (Palestine), Dresser " Birds of Europe"
VII. p-5i. Iu the original drawing from which fig. 2 in the
plate has been traced, which was taken from the type of Titrtur
douraca, the skin round the eye is coloured greyish white, with
no sign of yellow. This is a native drawing, and great care has
*evidently been taken, in this wonderful series of drawings of

Mr. T. H. Newman,
the Birds of India, bound in six large folio volumes, collected by
the late Mr. B. H. Hodgson, to get the soft parts of the birds
correctly coloured, as in addition to the birds themselves, there
are numerous coloured sketches of bills, feet, tongues etc. I am
not putting forward this yellow skin as something that has not
been noticed before, as Oates in his " Handbook to the Birds of
British Burmah " writes :--" eyelids and skin of face yellow,"
which exactly corresponds with my late lamented friend at the
Gardens and shows that this had nothing to do with captivity :
but no one so far seems to have called attention to the fact that
the Burmese bird differs from the Indian, etc. If the Yarkand
and Indian birds are worthy of being separated, how much more
should the Burmese bird with its very distinct feature deserve a
name? Not having a specimen to produce I hesitated to bestow
one, but on the suggestion of my friend Mr. Frank Finn, to whom
I have all along been indebted for having my attention called to
this interesting bird I put forward the name xanthocyclus for this
form which would stand as :--

In general appearance like T. decaocta decaocta, but easily dis-
tinguished by broad yellow bare rings round the eyes. Typical
localities, Minbu and Mague districts of Upper Burma.
I do not for a moment think the bird will be found worthy
of specific rank, as this case is exactly paralleled by the six
Turtle-doves received lately at Regent's Park, which are called
Bocage's Red-eyed Doves, but why red-eyed? You will look in
vain for it in these birds, but I have two, which also belong to
the same species (Turtur decipiens ), but to another form, which
have most conspicuous red skin round their eyes.
The Collared Turtle-dove seems to be far from common in
Burma, which would account for few specimens apparently being
available from this district, and this feature of yellow skin would
almost disappear in the dry skin. Hume who examined a skin
from Upper Pegu, thought the bird did not differ from Indian
examples, but Anderson in his ' Report on two Expeditions to
Western Yunnan,' writes of a specimen from the Upper defile,
Irawady, about 40 miles below Bhamo, and some 250 miles above

Nimbu and Mague. ' The colour generally is darker and more
vivid than in Indian specimens of the species, and the collar is
larger and more crescentic than in ordinary T. risorms (= T.
decaocta douraca), and if Jerdon's measurements are founded on
fresh specimens, this bird is decidedly larger. He gives 13
inches as the extreme length, but my specimen measures 14
inches, its wing 7 inches and its tail 6.' So that in its large size
and broader collar the Burmese bird would seem to approach the
typical form nearer than the Indian bird. The bird from China
and Japan should be compared with Burmese specimens, for
Swiuhoe writes in P.Z.S. for 1870, p. 446, 011 a bird from China in
the neighbourhood of the Great Wall ' its eyelid is pale yellow.'
It should be borne in mind that several of the Doves ot
Burma are replaced by a slightly different race or nearly allied
species in India, Crocopus viridifrons , the Burmese yellow-fronted
Green Pigeon is replaced in North and South India respectively
by the allied forms C. phcenicopterus and C. chlorogaster; Turtur
humilis with its lead grey under wing-coverts is replaced in India
by the closely allied T. tranquebaricus with light grey under
wing-coverts, and Burma has T. tigriuus, the Malayan Spotted
Turtle-dove which has grey eyelids ; while India has T. sura-
tensis, the pretty Indian Spotted Turtle, which has red eyelids.
To return once more to the Barbary Dove, there can be
110 longer any doubt that it is derived from the pretty little Rose-
grey Turtle-dove (T. roseogriseus) of N.E. Africa, as our esteemed
member Captain Shelley first pointed out more than twenty years
ago. I have looked through the series of skins of this bird at
the British Museum, and was struck with its close resemblance
to the tame bird, which is merely a coarse bleached Rose-grey
Turtle, having waxed fat through many generations of caged life
and having lost the beautiful pink gloss which adorns the wild bird.
It may be asked how comes it that we have a bird which has most
certainly been domesticated from a very remote period derived
from a bird which inhabits the district lying W. of the Red Sea,
and not from the bird which is found in India, when the ancient
civilization of the inhabitants would lead us to expect to find a
domesticated bird ? I have heard it suggested that this was the
bird which was used by the Israelites for their sacrifices, when

Turtle-doves were ordered to be among the animals used as
offerings, what more natural than that they should begin to keep
them domesticated as their other animals : cattle, sheep and
goats ? The Rose-grey Turtle does not now seem to occur in
Egypt, though Riippell gives Arabia, Abyssinia and Egypt, so it
may have formerly extended farther north, and it is not impos-
sible it may even once have been found in the Peninsular of
Sinai. But the Israelites could have obtained it even if it did
not inhabit the country where they were sojourning. We know
that the Egyptians domesticated many birds and animals ; they
certainly kept homer pigeons, so might have kept doves. Such
a supposition is of course conjectural, but the fact that the Bar-
bary Dove is found over such a wide area points to a very early

Furthermore I quote Mr. Arthur Thompson's statement that a

upon hundreds of these birds in all stages of their growth, but
had never known a change of colour to take place in the face,
either from black to red, or vice versa. Eater, however, I quote a
conversation which I had with Mr. Abrahams in which he stated
that the young of both varieties are at first grey- and then black-
headed, but that in P. mirabilis the black is greyer or more rusty
than in P. gouldice.

The Mutation of the Gouldian Finch. 327
On p. 176 I note that a lien P. gotildice in my bird-room
deserted its black-headed mate in favour of a red-headed cock in
the same aviary: from information received at various times
from owners of Gouldian finches I was convinced that this is the
rule rather than the exception, the hens of these birds showing
a decided preference for red-headed males, and this led me to
the conclusion that the Red-headed Gouldian is the perfected
form of the species, the Black-head being merely a transitional
form which must shortly die out.
Not long since an ornithologist tried to convince me that
birds had no sense of colour, that they did not choose their
mates 011 account of their beauty but because of their vigour.
Is it true that the carmine in the face of a Gouldian finch or
the blue in the eyes and plumage of a Satin Bowerbird are the
mere outward signs of superabundant vitality ? There is not the
least doubt that a Satin Bowerbird prefers blue to all other
colours; for, if you throw a handful of coloured feathers into
the aviary where he lives, he always selects the blue ones first;
anything blue is undoubtedly more attractive to him than if it
were of another colour. Does a bird so frivolous as a Bowerbird
actually reverence blue as an emblem of vigour? I fear I must
plead scepticism on this point; I would rather accept the fact
that birds appreciate beauty.
In the December number of the present volume Mr.
Phillipps severely criticizes a note in Mr. Campbell's " Dicho-
tomous Key to the Birds of Australia" hinting that the Black-
face ( P . gouldice ) is merely the young plumage of the Red-face
( P. mirabilis). Of course this is an error, but it is quite
possible (as Mr. Campbell has access to my " Foreign Finches
in Captivity") that the statements of Messrs. Thompson and
Abrahams led him astray.
Mr. Phillipps says--" The young of both are greenish
birds" which is a very vague way of describing the young: I
should describe them rather as dust-grey, whitish on under
parts and with a wash of dull green over wings and back, beak
blackish ; though I have no skin in the young plumage to refer
to, and my nestlings are tardy in leaving their nests, so that I
have to trust to memory (I have one skin in transitional plumage).

I believe the explanation of Messrs. Thompson and
Abrahams' statements is the following :--Supposing a Black-
headed hen bred from mixed parents were unable to secure a
Red-headed mate and therefore had to pair with a mate of her
own colour, any young which she produced could hardly be
expected to show very strong traces of red blood in the plumage ;
such a bird might be the hen figured in my " Foreign Finches "
in which there were only one or two small scattered feathers of
carmine on the head : the hen which I bred with last year showed
a trace more red on the head, but was by no means a well-
marked female Red-head; after the autumn moult, however,
there was a very considerable increase of red feathers on the
face of this bird. Anybody looking at the plate of Gouldian
Finches in my book might easily mistake the female there
figured for that sex of P. gouldicz; and in my opinion the birds
observed by Mr. Thompson were Red-lieaded birds of this type
which developed a far more noticeable amount of red on their
faces at their second moult. With regard to Abrahams' statement,
it is based upon the fact that at a short distance, when the small
feathers of the head are emerging from their sheaths, they do
not look decidedly red, but a greyish or rusty black, according to
whether you see more of the sheath or the feather as the bird
turns its head about; as soon as the feather is far enough de-
veloped to open out flat the red colour is easily seen.
In my note on " Mutations in Birds " in last November's
number (p. 49), after mentioning that I had bred two young from
the above-mentioned poorly defined P. mirabilis female and a
well-defined male P. gouldicz, I observed that it would be interest-
ing to see whether they would prove to be Red- or Black-headed
Gouldians: I am now able to clear up that point.
The Gouldian finch is about the slowest in its development
of any finch I know of: in my experience the young are about
six weeks before they leave the nest, to start with. My young
birds left the nest before the end of September last year and by
the end of the following April they were just beginning to
assume their adult colouring ; one, which proves to be a hen, was
in full colour by June 17th and is a typical P. gouldicz, at any
rate I can see 110 red on the face at a distance of eight feet or so ;

the other, which is a cock bird, cannot complete its change to
the adult plumage before about the middle of the present month
(August) ; it is a well-marked P. mirabilis , far better marked than
its mother was. I have not the least doubt that, if this pair were
to go to nest together, they would produce a majority of young
of the Red-lieaded variety ; the male, though bred from a Black-
headed father and an ill-defined Red-headed mother, being a
typical P. mirabilis, and the female, though of the P. gouldicz
type, having red blood in her veins, would certainly tend to
throw red- rather than black-headed young.
Last February I purchased the finest pair of P. mirabilis
that I ever saw, the female showing as much red on the face as
the male ; from these I had hoped to breed strong birds this year
with which to experiment further ; but just as I was deciding
that the weather was becoming mild enough to turn them out,
first the hen and then the cock died within three days ; I there-
fore had to turn out last year's parent birds with a second hen
which had been given to me : I heard young in two nests a month
ago, but it is wearisome work waiting for them to fly, and if it
were not that both hens still visit the nests I should imagine that
all the 3^oung had died.
So far, I think my belief that the Red-headed variety of
this species is a mutation from the Black-headed variety is
justified. It would be interesting to experiment with the more
delicate yellow-headed (P. armitiana) phase of P. mirabilis with
a view to establishing it as a race, but I have never yet seen a
specimen of this sport.

Mr. Gibbons enquires whether Zebra Finches have ever
been turned out in Devon and Cornwall. I am not aware of
their having been turned out in these counties, but on two
occasions we have turned out large numbers at Woburn, also
Budgerigars, Pekin Nightingales, Saffron Finches, Tonkin
Buntings (?so called by Cross of Liverpool) and many kinds
of doves and pigeons. I believe that some of the Pekin

Nightingales were seen in the neighbourhood two years after-
wards. The Budgerigars stayed one year. The Zebra Finches
disappeared in a month or two. The Saffron Finches also
disappeared, but we have recently turned out a second lot, and
at the same time more Budgerigars, Crested Cardinals, and
Yellow-billed Cardinals. A great many of these are about still.
We turned out many hardy Cockatoos and Parrots. Those
which were let out without cutting the wing feathers went away
immediately and were never seen again. The others remained
about a year in a large enclosure and destroyed every fir tree
they could get at. When their wings grew they, with the
exception of two, also went off and were seen no more. The
remaining two have been about the garden for three years.
Some of your readers may be interested to hear that a
Pintail Duck brought up a family of five young ones till they
were half grown, when mother and young were killed by some
animal. We had had the duck seventeen years.
Two Japanese White-necked Cranes were hatched, one in
the incubator which only lived two days and one by the parents.
This one was unfortunately drowned in a pond when about three
weeks old. Two European Cranes hatched by the parents are
doing well and almost full grown. The Stanley Cranes nested
and sat, but the eggs were unfertile and the same thing occurred
with the Bewick and Whooper Swans.
Ten Darwin's Rheas were hatched by the cock bird and,
with the exception of three which were drowned in the water
trough are doing well. Three others hatched in the incubator
and brought up by hand are also doing well and are now six
weeks old.
A few Amherst Pheasants in those parts of the London
Parks which are fenced off from dogs would be a great
attraction. If turned out with a cut wing they would probably
never leave the place when they got their new feathers.

Tachyphonus melaleucus.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
I believe I am right in saying that experiments in the
breeding of Tanagers have not been numerous. There is how-
ever an old saying that " fools press in where angels fear to
tread" ; and it was in this spirit that, when making my arrange-
ments for this season, I determined to try a pair of Tanagers.
Now although there are several hundred known species of
Tanagers to select from I simply purchased the first I came
across and that happened to be a cock Black Tanager. It cost
me five shillings and sixpence. This was the early part of
January of this year. In due course I obtained a hen from a
dealer in the north of England.
It is usual to describe the female of this species as brown.
Personally I call her a bright tan (when in breeding plumage) ;
but perhaps I am wrong. Let it therefore be understood by these
presents that wherever the word ' tan ' is hereinafter used, it is
used without prejudice.
As to the colour of the male there can be no dispute. He
is a deep indigo black, with a beautiful blue sheen, and he has a
bold white patch on the shoulder of the wing and a good deal
of white under the wings. This white patch he can cover up at
will with overlying black feathers, so that sometimes you behold
a black bird and sometimes a black and white one. He is a very
graceful bird--long and slim, with long pointed wings and a
very long tail.
I first tried the Black and Tans (as we will call them) in an
indoor flight with some Persian Bulbuls, but the latter would
soon have made an end of them. So I turned them out, on the
nth March, in the Waxbills' aviary. This is a small but very
warm and sunny (heated) aviary, where several delicate little
species have been reared, including the Firefinch, the Bib Finch,
and the Golden-breasted Waxbill. Here they flourished ex-
ceedingly, but unfortunately they began to persecute the small
fry in a most disgraceful manner. A convalescent Shama joined
in the game and nothing but the abundance of cover prevented
a tragedy.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
The question now to be decided was--what to do with the
Black and Tans ?
I built some breeding pens this year (as they were recom-
mended by some of our members) and one of these was still
unoccupied, being reserved for my old pair of Virginian Car-
dinals. Now as the Tanagers were a ioo to i chance and the
Virginians had reared no less than nine young to the flying stage
in 1905 (although for various reasons only three survived), it
seemed a reasonable decision to let the latter have the pen.
However, in aviary matters, it is usually the unexpected that
happens, and so it was in this case. Yet I doubt very much
whether, if I had put the Tanagers by themselves, I should have
been able to report a successful result. For these breeding pens
have proved with me quite a failure and I have returned to my
original point of view--that a bird (and especially an active,
restless species) is better in health and more likely to breed in a
large aviary where it has others to persecute and be persecuted
by.
So the Black and Tans were put into No. 1--so called
because it was the first outdoor aviary I ever constructed--and
for the simple reason that there was no other place to put them.
Here there were some Pekins, some Green Singing Finches,
some Bib Finches, a pair of Ortolans, some Roller Canary hens--
in a word, nothing of value except a really good cock Roller, the
only good one I bred in '05.
This aviary is 14 ft. long, 10 ft. deep, and only 6 ft. 6in.
high. It contains a small covered house, very slightly warmed.
It has a high brick wall on two sides, with pear and peach trees,
and, on the other, the side of the house of the larger aviary. In
front there are some euonymus shrubs, at the back a low privet
hedge, and in the middle a path used twice a day by the servant
going to fill the seed tins in the larger aviary.
A more unlikely place to breed Tanagers than this could
hardly be imagined ; indeed, with the exception of the Indian
Silverbill, I have never bred anything at all out of the common
in this little aviary.
I have nothing more to record about the Black Tanagers
until the 12th of May, 011 which day I saw them making a tour

of the aviary evidently house hunting. The male bird was con-
ducting the hen round, calling her attention to various desirable
sites and especially to the euonymus. The lady, however,
seemed somewhat peevish ; " the situation (she was evidently
saying) is positively horrible--so overlooked ; no, I could not
think of it."
However, ultimately she changed her mind, for, on the
14th of June, I witnessed a most amusing little episode. The
Black and Tans were darting about the aviary in a state of great
excitement. They kept on plunging into the euonymus bush
and finally the hen settled 011 a nest box hanging on the wire
netting just above it. The male bird darted away and returned
with a stem of dried groundsel which he flourished in the air
and then deposited at her feet--only to be tossed away. He then
produced a stick which she also contemptuously rejected. He
then dashed into the euonymus and, breaking off a large shoot,
laid it in triumph before her. But this was quite too much for
the lady's patience : she flew at him in a royal rage and drove
him screaming round the aviary. Evidently in the Tanager
community the feminine sex has got beyond the suffragette
stage : it is the male sex which humbly craves a vote--and does
not get it!
Next morning I provided some hay, and in two days' time
the nest was completed. It was placed in the thick privet hedge
but quite at the top, so that from above it could be looked into
without the least difficulty. It was a very good nest, firmly
woven, unlined, and almost as deep as a Reed Warbler's. When
the hen sat in it only the tip of her tail could be seen.
The first egg was laid (and incubation commenced) on the
17th. Another egg was laid on the 18th, and the third and last
on the 19th.
At first sight the eggs looked very like those of the com-
mon Thrush, but on closer examination they could not possibly
be mistaken for those of any other species. The ground colour
is a delicate cream ; the shell is very thin and china-like; the
shape is nearly a true ellipse and, in addition to the irregular
black spots, there are a few fine wavy lines--in fact a beautiful
and unique egg.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
The hen proved a very unsteady sitter, constantly coining
off the nest for a fly round the aviary and, if I came anywhere
near, always making a point of coming to see if I had a meal-
worm for her. The male bird would fly after her, doing his best
to drive her back to the nest. But he never attempted to sit
himself.
Whilst the hen sat, the male would perch on a small
shrub close by singing. No doubt he did his best, but his efforts
were certainly not melodious--consisting merely of alow, jerky,
intermittent warbling. He sings with the beak closed--not that
this necessarily means a poor performer, for the Indian Shama
does the same.
The period of incubation was 13 days ; and on July 1st
the nest contained two young and one (addled) egg. The young
were very tiny things with dark lead-coloured skin and covered
with black-coloured down.
I have omitted to mention that 011 June 29th we had an
almost continuous downpour of twelve hours duration, nearly
two inches of rain falling, and during that day the lieu Tauager
certainly sat splendidly. I had arranged some boards on the top
of the aviary as a shelter for her, but unfortunately these only
acted as a conduit, allowing a stream of water to fall on the sitting
bird. I therefore made a framework of wood, covered with
linoleum, and setting a ladder against the aviary, pushed it along
the top of the wire netting with a long pole. The bird sat most
courageously until I had nearly completed this complicated
operation, and then she darted into the covered house and helped
herself to a little food whilst I finished.
The male bird had been most aggressive during the whole
period of incubation but he now became simply unbearable.
One day I saw him seize the cock Roller Canary by the neck
and shake him as a terrier shakes a rat. I caught up the Pekius
but the Roller I could not catch and next day I found him in a
dying state. He also killed a cock Ortolan Bunting and I fear
that the bad reputation of the Tauagers is only too well earned
as far as the Black Tauager is concerned.
Both parents fed the young which on July 6th shewed
sheath feathers of a dark brown colour.

on the Nesting of the Black Ta?iagcr. 335
On July 10th a great change was to be seen in the young
Black and Tans. Their eyes were open and they had a good
covering of tan coloured feathers, a little lighter and not quite so
ruddy as the hen's.
On the 1 xtli and 12th the hen was continually bathing.
No doubt, after her long period of incubation, she was troubled
by a certain crawliness.
The largest youngster left the nest on the 12th ; he is very
like his mother, except that he is a shade lighter and his feet are
bluish. I never saw a more self-possessed bird. He sat on the
pear tree in solemn silence, looking neither to the left nor to the
right. There is a quaint story in Herodotus of certain allies of
the Spartans who, in a time of famine, sent a deputation to the
Council of Ephors with a request for assistance. Well knowing the
Spartan characteristic of brevity of speech, the deputation pro-
vided themselves with a mealsack and, holding this before them
with open mouth, they said " The mealsack wants filling." The
Council granted their request but added a rider to the effect that
there had been some waste of words as the deputation need only
have said " wants filling." But this young Tanager went one
better for he simply opened his mouth and said nothing. I may
add that I have never heard the young utter a sound.
The second--a much smaller bird but of a deeper shade--
left the nest the following day. I kept them well supplied with
insect food, but I have a note that on the 15th I saw the hen carry-
ing a piece of banana. I did not see her give it to them but I
have since seen the young fed with fruit, and I can therefore state
as a fact that their diet is not entirely insectivorous, as one
would expect.
On the 23rd the hen bird was evidently thinking of nest-
ing again, so I removed old and young to an indoor flight. Here
for nearly a whole day this queer, cranky family--both young and
old--sulked and refused to feed; but at length they thought
better of it, and now are most flourishing.
Although I have found them very interesting birds, I may
here say that I do not want any more Black Tanagers, nor do I
think that breeding the members of the Calliste or Tachyphonus
groups--will ever be popular with our members. I do not

think these birds would ever go to nest in a small breeding pen
(of course I may be wrong); they seem to need a fair amount
of room, and the birds they are associated with must not be
valuable ones, nor must any other nesting be expected. I think,
however, the above notes will show that a large aviary is not
required and that interference with the nest is not resented if
care has been taken to get the birds thoroughly tame and
familiar.
I have not said anything about methods, because my very
scanty experience relates only to one species, and, seeing that
this great family includes such an enormous range of species,
some being largely seed eaters (some ornithologists would even
class these with the Fringillidce ), and some, as the little Violet
Tanager, almost exclusively fruit eaters, it is evident that methods
would have to differ in almost every case.
A NOTE ON THE BREEDING OF PAL^ORNIS
MAGNIROSTRIS.
By H. Boughton-Leigh.
I have been successful this year in breeding the Great-
billed Andaman Parrakeet (.Palczornis ?nagnirostris).
Last summer I bought a very fine pair of this species from
a dealer and put them into an out-door aviary by themselves.
This summer the hen laid two eggs from which two young ones
were hatched. The nest was a poplar log, partly hollow, set up
on end with a hole at the side and a board over the top. The
cock bird did not sit on the eggs at all; so differing from my
cock Riugneclc Parrakeet (P. torquatus) which sits on the nest
beside the hen almost continuously through the period of
incubation, going off only to feed.
The young birds were brought up on seed only--canary
with a little hemp or sunflower. One left the nest fully fledged
on the third of this month, the other three days later. Their
plumage is exactly like that of the adult hen, except that their
tails are shorter, and their shoulder spots smaller and of a duller
tint.

By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
During a long cruise of nearly 20,000 miles, and the visit-
ing of numerous places, some extremely remote, a vast number
of birds must necessarily be met with, a full account of which
would be too long and perhaps out of place in this Magazine ;
but I will just note a few of the most striking birds, and give an
account of some that we brought back with us on the yacht.
Bahia in South Eastern Brazil was the first place at which we
made any prolonged stay.
In the town itself several birds entirely new to me were
seen on first landing; the most prominent of which was a
charming familiar bird--which was common through the streets
and in the houses--quite tame and evidently treated as the Robin
is with us. I do not know that it has an English name : its
scientific one is Fhivicola climocura. It has a strong resemblance
to one of the desert Wheatears, and is black and isabeline in
colour. A tiny green bird Todirostrum cineretim, and a large
Wren, T?vglodytes nnisculus, were frequently in evidence. We
procured some birds in the market, many of which survived the
whole of the voyage. The most attractive of these were the
Chopi Starlings, Aphobus chopi, delightful birds, absolutely
tame and with most musical voices. These birds may be
seen in the Western Aviary at the Zoological Gardens; one of
them is usually having his head scratched through the bars by
some visitor. A Black Han guest, Cassidyx orizivora, is a rare
bird, and had many comical ways ; it would " show off" to any
bird, and was especially attracted by two Assumption Island
Rails, procured later on the voyage. This great bird with its
powerful beak cared for nothing but Canary seed, on which it
throve. A pair of Pileatedjays never became really tame, but
had most flexible voices, and were remarkably affectionate to one
another: they seemed the hardiest birds we had on the yacht.
A Blue Grosbeak, Giiiraca cyanea; a Black Grosbeak, Oryzoborus
torridus (the latter a very tame little bird with a pretty habit of
spreading his tail into a fan when approached); a pair of Seed-

eaters, Spermophila nigroaurantia; a Pileated Finch, Coryphos-
pingus pileatus, called " Fidalgo "=gentleman, in Brazil, where it
appears to be thought much of as a cage bird ; and four Siskins
Chrysomitrisyarrelli, were the most notable birds we procured
alive in Bahia. These Siskins I regret to say died, they were in
feeble condition when procured and could not stand the hard
seed and sudden change to colder latitudes when we ran south
to Tristan d'Acunha ; I fancy they are rare cage-birds, and can-
not recollect to have seen them alive in this country. The little
Sperviophilas were always getting out through the bars of their
cane-made cage and, although freshly caught wild birds, were
most anxious to get back again ; after flying about in the rigging
and into the saloons they would seek the top of their own cage,
and would either be caught or hop in themselves if possible
through&apos; its open door. The little cock of this pair got away
in the night just before we reached England, and was one of
the very few birds we 'lost.
We spent much time on a large island called Itaparica, on
the opposite side of the river to Bahia, very sparsely inhabited
and covered with indigenous forest. To attempt to describe and
enumerate the birds would be impossible here, but the numbers
of species and individuals must be seen to be believed. The
forest teemed with bird life, and those who claim that tropical
birds have no songs, but only squawk and are silent, would be
somewhat surprised at the chorus of song and sweet voices that
came from every quarter. What was particularly striking
amongst the birds here, as we found elsewhere in the Southern
Hemisphere, was the extreme fearlessness of man of almost all
the birds ; nothing seemed afraid of you. Another thing was
that, with all these hosts of birds the greater part of which
appeared to be building, we saw very few nests, either old or
new, and the same applied throughout the Tropics. With half
the amount of birds in England one would have found scores of
nests. Perhaps the prevailing genus, or at any rate the most
obtrusive one, were the Tyranidce, tyrants, and their voices (all
species appeared to have more or less modifications of the same
cry, " Bien ti veo," = I see you well) echoed from every quarter,
but Tanagers of many kinds swarmed, the scarlet and maroon

perhaps the commonest, these were breeding and also in flocks.
Callisles, Elainias , Sugar-birds, Ccereba, Dacnis , Humming-birds
of several species, Woodpeckers, Cuckoos, Kingfishers, and
genera and species almost without end cropped up wherever we
went. These were all new to me in a wild state and the
experience was a delightful one.
Of the Humming-birds I was surprised at how com-
paratively sedentary they were, for although they could and
did fly, and uncommonly fast and well, still they appeared to
me to spend most of their time at rest. Insects appeared to
form the whole of their food as far as I could see. Indeed
there were practically no flowers, their plan of operation being
to fly to the foot of a tree and buzz up the trunk, stopping at
intervals to pick off some insect. They would occasionally stop
at some part for some time feeding eagerly, the body apparently
suspended in the air, the rapid vibration of their wings rendering
them almost invisible. When finished with one trunk they
would fly off and begin at the bottom of another. I watched one
little mite sitting in and making its nest within a yard, it showed
no concern, and I caught one in a butterfly net when buzzing at
a flower.
Here, as elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, we saw
very few Swifts or Swallows, and I am pretty sure I have seen
many more Swifts and Hirundines in one day in England since
my return than we saw during the whole voyage, the possible
exception being the Swifts over the town of Algeciras in Spain.
With the exception of two Vultures, Caihartes aiira and Cathartes
atratus, birds of prey seemed scared, and these Vultures are
pure scavengers.
The Brazilian Caracara is common enough, and a very
striking bird on the wing. A rather sluggish Sparrow-Hawk
was not rare, and at night two kinds of Nightjar were very
abundant. A large Scops Owl was common, and I heard
repeatedly some Owls of the genus Syrnium, but did not see
them. O11 some lagoons a beautiful little Heron, Butorides, was
abundant, as also were Jacanas and a Water-Hen, but we only
saw one true duck, the Brazilian Teal.
We spent some ten days on this interesting island and

four never-to-be-forgotten nights! when we bivouacked without
any ordinary camp appliances (see illustration) and were
devoured by ticks and mosquitos. The feature of this ground
was mostly tropical forest, some virgin, but some had evidently
been burnt at different periods. It was abundantly watered,
mostly by lagoons and marshes, but there are some springs
and small streams.
In a future number of the Magazine I hope to give a
further account of some of the islands we visited, with a short
account of the birds, several living examples of which may now
be seen in the Zoological Gardens.
THE BREEDING OF THE YELLOWISH FINCH.
Although there is little that is particularly interesting or
attractive in Sycalis arvensis as an avicultural subject it may be
worth while to place on record the successful rearing of a young
bird in my aviary this summer, especially as I believe it to be
the first instance of this species rearing young in this country.
In this Magazine for January, 1905, Dr. Butler published a
very interesting and exhaustive article on this species, so that
little need be said here except to describe the nesting habits as
observed in my aviary. Quite early in the summer the cock
commenced his song, which Dr. Butler has aptly compared to the
running down of a watch-spring. It is nothing but a somewhat
shrill buzzing, unlike that of any other bird with which I am
acquainted, though perhaps the Grass-hopper Warbler comes
closest to it. Whenever the hen showed herself the cock would
commence his buzzing and fly to a branch near her and expand
and quiver his wings and tail, the while swaying his body from
side to side and buzzing his loudest.
There is, in my aviary, a thick clump of brushwood reach-
ing to a height of nine or ten feet, through which have grown
privet and gooseberry bushes, so that the whole now forms a
tangled mass of sticks and growing branches. Right in the
centre of this tangle the hen Yellowish Finch constructed her
nest which was entirely built of grass, the outer part being of

coarse steins and the inside of fine blades. Three eggs were
laid, and so far as I could see (I could not get within some three
feet of the nest) closely resembled those of a Linnet. On July 4th
I saw the hen very busily collecting aphis from the underside of
some hop leaves, and I could make out one or two newly hatched
chicks in the nest. After the first few days grass seeds seemed
to be preferred to any other food. I supplied flowering grass
daity and the parent Yellowish Finches were on to it immediately
it was thrown into the aviary. A pair of Olive Finches which
had a hungry brood near by, which they too seemed to feed
almost entirely upon grass-seed, had constant battles with the
Yellowish Finches, in fact the little cock Phonipara lepida is not
in the least afraid to charge a bird several times his own size,
but the Yellowish Finches generally managed to hold their own.
On July nth one young bird, not unlike a young Yellow-
hammer, left the nest, but took care to keep in the midst of the
thickest cover it could find. I rarely saw it, and the old birds
would never go to feed it if they knew that a human being was
within sight.
A few days after it left the nest, I made a note that it was
similar to its mother in colour except that its throat was whiter
and the chest was spotted with brown. As I write (August 10)
it is as large as its parents and almost as bright in colour as the
adult male, which would seem to show that the sex can be
distinguished at an early period. The hen has repaired the
old nest and is sitting again. D. Seth-Smith.

Sir, -- I have bred the Scarlet Tanager. The hen bird brought off
three little birds, all hardy and strong. The little birds were very black
with down when they were hatched, then one became mouse - colour, and
the mouse-colour one, I feel sure, would have proved to be the Scarlet cock
Tanager.
I regret to say the hen bird, the mother, brought all the 3&apos;oung birds
down in her wing-feathers, and they fell from the highest part of the aviary
and got killed. I find the cock bird did all the feeding, and the little birds
lived to be three weeks old.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., F.B.S., F.Z.S., etc.
To breed the familiar hybrids between a British finch and
a Canary seems to me to be a pastime utterly devoid of interest:
compared with the hybridization of foreign birds, it is by no
means difficult; but one always knows, when one puts the birds
together, almost exactly what the hybrids will be like. The
hybrids hitherto produced between British finches are almost
equally uninteresting, on account of our familiarity with them
on the show-bench ; and although it is possible that a scientific
study of them might throw some light on the past, I believe
no attempt has hitherto been made to study and compare their
characters from a scientific standpoint.
When one essays to cross the various Ploceid finches there
is far more to hope for : as a rule one does not know in the least
what will be the result of the union, and consequently the
interest in the intermarriage is considerable; but, to breed
hybrid Ploceidce to order is by no means easy: one may pair up
opposite sexes of two species and keep them together in a
spacious flight-cage for years, but it is about a hundred to one
that they will take no notice of one another, excepting to dis-
pute over food or a roostiug-place for the night.
I have tried numbers of assorted species together in cages,
and the only success I ever had with these birds was in crossing
the Sharp-tailed finch and Bengalee; two species so closely
related that the late Dr. Russ considered them doubtfully dis-
tinct ; though the specific characters which distinguish Uroloncka
acuticauda and U. striata are far better defined than those of
many other species.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
As a matter of fact most recorded instances of hybridization
between Ploceid finches in captivity have been voluntary and
have taken their owners by surprise, the parentage of the young
being frequently only discovered after they have left the nest :
yet there are still men so inattentive to what is constantly going
on around them, that they persist in dogmatically asserting that
no bird or beast willingly intermarries with an alien species.
In the case of the more excitable and vicious of the
Columbce I have had abundant evidence that they are not only
desirous of breeding with those of another species, but with any
other bird in the enclosure with them, though in no respect
related and perchance not more than an eighth or tenth of their
bulk. A Passerine dove which I still have so persecuted a hen
Zebra-finch with its attentions that I had to remove it to another
cage, while three Steel-barred or Picui-doves which I had for
some years would coo and bow to any other dove however large
it was : but it is not only among the Columbce that one notices
these depraved traits, for in my " Foreign Finches" ist. ed. p. 78
I have recorded the fact of a Rosella parrakeet trying its utmost
to induce a Red-crested Cardinal to accept it as a husband.
This being so, it is not merely far from surprising that
wild hybrids should be occasionally trapped or shot, but the
marvel is that instances of hybridization among wild birds
should not be considerably more numerous than they are. At
the same time it is probable that, as a general rule, male Passerine
birds would persistently mate with their own sisters, but for the
great annual mortality which from various causes serves to break
up the family parties, and thus compels the bereaved units to
seek fresh mates : were it not for these apparently adverse hap-
penings it is probable that sterility would soon reduce their
species.
If no mate of its own kind is available, it is not unnatural
that a vigorous male bird should console himself with an allied
species, or that even in the restricted space of a large aviary an
amorous bird should not be over-sensitive as to the degree of
affinity of its selected wife.
The bird which illustrates this article is the result of the
crossing of two species by no means closely related : in size,

general pattern, colouring, and also (which I consider far more
important) in voice or language, they are very dissimilar; there
being no resemblance whatever between the plaintive mewing of
a Spotted-sided finch and the staccato toy-trumpet notes of a
Zebra-finch : furthermore, as the late Dr. Russ correctly pointed
out, the Diamond- or Spotted-sided finch is by no means an easy
bird to breed, whereas the Zebra-finch is more easily bred than
any other Grass-fincli. It is interesting to note that the hybrid
of our plate is the only known mule with Staganopleura guttata
as one parent which is recorded by Dr. Russ as having been bred
prior to 1887.
Respecting this hybrid its owner (Mr. Seth-Smith) writes
as follows :--" I received the hybrid on the 24th of April last.
It was bred in captivity in Australia, the male parent being a
Diamond-finch and the female a Zebra-finch. It is slightly
smaller than a Diamond - finch and less clumsily built. In
appearance it resembles the Diamond-finch more than the Zebra-
finch, but its song is much more like that of a Zebra- than a
Diamond-finch.
"It has become a good deal darker on the chest than when
the drawing was made. The reddish colouring on the chest is
curious, as neither of the parent species has it. The bill, you
will notice, is not nearly so red as in either parent."
It seems to me that in hybrids between species not nearly
related, we ought not to expect to see a perfect combination of
the two parent species ; that, to some extent, there is likely to be
a throw-back to the remote common ancestor of both and of
other species. In some of the descendants of this extinct an-
cestor we should expect to find the reddish breast retained in a
more or less modified condition ; and in Emblema picta, which
Russ' observations seem to prove to be related to Staganopleura
guttata , we find the centre of the lower breast and abdomen
scarlet like the rump.
Both the Diamond- and the cock Zebra-finch have white
spotted sides, the spots in the former being upon a black ground
as in Emblema picta , but those in the latter upon a cinnamon
ground ; at an earlier stage of their evolution, doubtless, the
sides of the ancestor of these birds were merely crossed by

Dr. A. G. Butler,
crescentic bars, by the gradual widening and eventual union
of which, spots of the white ground-colour were formed: in a
partial reversion to a common ancestral type one might reason-
ably expect this ancient feature to reappear, and thus the more
or less crescentic character of the markings in this hybrid may
be explained ; whereas, if all hybrids were perfect combinations
of the two parents, the sides in this bird should have been brown
spotted with white.
In the Bicheno x Zebra-finch hybrid (See " Foreign Bird-
Keeping" part I. page 49) we again get crescentic markings on
the sides of the body, while in the Parson-finch x Bengalee
(" Foreign Bird-Keeping" part I. p. 46) we see how the fusion of
short parallel black bars may have gradually developed into the
complete black gorget of some of the Grass-finches, while in
others like the Zebra- and Pectoral-finches, in which they have
only been continued transversely, we find a tolerably regularly
barred breast.
But there is another point to which I must call attention
in the marking of the recently imported hybrid : --whereas the
lateral markings on the hind-breast are purely crescentic in
character, those flanking the abdomen more nearly resemble
those of Amadina erythrocephala and its evident relatives the
Spice-finches-- Munia punctulata and allies : we may reasonably
conclude that, at the period when the common ancestor of the
Diamond- and Zebra-finches existed, it would have been more
hopelessly impossible than it is now to distinguish between
Grass-finches and Mannikins. Although, as I pointed out in my
" Foreign Finches in Captivity " it is convenient now to make an
arbitrary division between the two for show-purposes, there is
much in common, as regards pattern, between such apparently
distinct birds as Poephila gouldice and Munia castaneithorax ,
while the species of Amadina have quite as much right to be
regarded as Mannikins, as they have to be retained among the
more typical Grassfinches.
And there is yet another point of interest in these cres-
centic and otherwise linear markings, inasmuch as they being
(as is well-known) the first steps towards the production of the
conspicuous spots and ocelli which adorn many of the more

specialized living creatures now existing, * it is probable that
those species which still retain such primitive markings are of
far greater antiquity and more nearly resemble the ancestral
types of their family than those in which sharply defined spotting
such as we note on the Diamond- and Painted-finches, is found:
moreover the generally dull colouring of the Mannikins seems to
favour the view of their antiquity as contrasted with the more
typical Grass-finches.
It is, I think, probable that the Waxbills are an offshoot
from the Grassfinches, which in many respects they resemble :
they are more sprightly in their movements, have better trained
voices, and though they court their wives much in the same
fashion, holding a long grass-stem in their beaks, they hold their
beaks pointing upwards rather thau in the depressed fashion
common to the Grassfinches and Mannikins.
Among the various hybrids between Ploceid finches re-
corded by the late Dr. Russ, are not a few which have since been
bred in the British Isles: unfortunately Russ omits to record the
names of the breeders and Mr. Hawkins is just as uncommuni-
cative with regard to those exhibited of late years at our bird-
shows.
Taking them in the order of my " Foreign Finches in
Captivity," the following is a list:--

and I called his attention to the fact that the development of somewhat similar spots

wings of moths of the genus Brahmcea (c f. Darwin, Descent of Man, vol, II., p. 143 and

that he had bred mules from the Bengalee (now generally re-

firmed.
It is not improbable that Dr. Greene's correspondent, who
remembered having once bred from a Mannikin (species not

memory. What is more likely, after the lapse of years, than that
memory should have confounded Alario alario with Munia

The last two are recorded by Russ and have been subse-

Mr. Abrahams also told me that he had seen a cross be-
tween the Java Sparrow and the Ribbon-finch, which induced me
to put up a pair for breeding; I kept them together in a flight-
cage for about two years and the hen (Java Sparrow) laid innu-
merable eggs, all of which were clear: I strongly suspect that a
Red-headed finch was the true parent of the bird seen by Mr.
Abrahams, its size being nearer to that of the Java Sparrow;
yet it is odd that the much smaller Silverbill should have suc-
cessfully produced mules with a Java Sparrow when a Ribbon-
finch failed to do so.

have been illustrated ; and in the fact that they sometimes
exhibit characters possessed by neither parent and therefore
presumably inherited from some extinct progenitor, it seems
to me far more important that they should be figured, than
that species of birds already sufficiently well known and
accurately delineated should have their portraits duplicated.
In illustrating the Diamond x Zebra-finch I am satisfied
that the Avicultural Society is commencing a work which will
prove to be of considerable scientific interest, and I shall hope-
fully look forward to the publication from time to time in our
volumes of many more portraits of hybrids in the possession of
our members: should this throw even the least ray of light upon
the origin of existing species, it will be well worth doing.
I feel sure that the less closely related the two parents of a
hybrid may be, the more likely will the latter be to reproduce
long-lost features, or those perchance retained by other de-
scendants, of a common remote ancestor; but in closely related
species the hybrid may be expected to be simply intermediate in
character.
As evidence of the difficulty of intentionally breeding
Ploceid hybrids, I may refer our members to my paper in the
&quot;'Avicultural Magazine" for May 1904 (2nd ser., Vol. II., p. 219)
" On the difficulty of sexing Bicheno's Finch" in which, after
considerable effort to produce the Bicheno x Zebra-finch hybrid,
I found that both my supposed cock birds were hens; and when

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
I turned one of these into an aviary with a cock Zebra-finch,
nothing resulted therefrom.
Undeterred by this failure I, last year, purchased a pair of
Stictoptera bichenovii, the hen of which died : I therefore turned
out two hen Tceniopygia casla?iotis with the supposed cock : the
latter selected one of these hens as its companion and the two
spend their time from year's end to year's end in building nests
in various receptacles, the Zebra-finch from time to time laying
and sitting; but up to the present date no young have been
hatched.*
In the past I have tried to cross Poephila gozilditz with
Staganopleura guttata , with Poephila cincta and with Tceniopygia
castanotis ; in each case the hen ( P . gouldics) died egg-bound;
but then all were tried in flight-cages. I think it highly probable
that an aviary reserved for mule-breeding, in which were placed
males only of three or four widely different species, and females
only of three or four other species, might yield very satisfactory
results; at any rate it would be worth trying.
THE BREEDING OF THE RED-HEADED FINCH.
Amadina erythrocephala .
By W. E. Teschemaker.
Although I do not myself know of another instance of
the Red-headed Finch being successfully reared in this country,
yet it is reported to have bred so freely in Germany and so many
have been imported here these last two seasons that I think
there is much probability that it has been reared. Indeed it
would be a very singular thing if success had not been attained
seeing that this hardy South African species is perhaps the most
persevering layer and sitter with which I am acquainted. At all
times and seasons its whole energies appear to be devoted to
incubation.
There must, however, be some little hitch in the breeding
of this species, for it has, to my knowledge, been tried in not a
few aviaries where it had every chance of success, but without

on the Breeding of the Red-headed Finch.
success. Several correspondents have written me about their
Red-headed Finches but without making the difficulty any
clearer to me. One member writes, "My birds have never got
beyond eggs." A lady member wrote me a very interesting letter
from which I extract the following:--" I find the Red-headed
Finches are easily disturbed. I did not know of a nest and
found it had two eggs and near hatching." Another lady
correspondent (not a member) wrote me as follows :--"I am very
much annoyed with my Red-headed Finches which threw three
fine youngsters out of their nest." This happened, I may add, in
a bird-room and may perhaps be due to some defect of the
indoor system, although I read in a certain weekly Fanciers'
paper that the latter is the correct system for breeding foreigners,
as in outdoor aviaries the young are so frequently drowned (sic.).
I had a pair of this species in 1905 which sat with the
regularity and consistency of a Hearson's Incubator, but never
managed to produce any fertile eggs--the cause being, I think,
the delicacy of the hen which died in the late autumn.
I obtained a new hen in January of this year, which made
a bad commencement, becoming egg - bound and laying some
soft eggs. However she recovered, and from that time forward
either she or her partner were sitting, I may say, continuously
in their own particular nest box. During the day time the male
seemed to do as much sitting as the hen, taking spells of about
an hour each. From time to time they added to the nest until
at last the box became so full of hay that the Red-heads--being
birds of somewhat portly habit--found considerable difficulty in
getting in or out. Both birds were exceedingly tame.
About the middle of April I examined the nest and found
that it contained two eggs. I examined it again about a mouth
later and again found two eggs. I extracted one and, finding that
it rattled, I concluded they must be the same eggs and removed
them. This proved however to be a mistake, for, on blowing
them, one egg proved to be not only fertile but on the point of
hatching. The next box was found to contain alternate layers
of eggs and nesting material. The eggs varied considerably in
size, the largest being -8i and the smallest 70 in greatest
diameter. They are pure white in colour.

356 Oji the Breeding of the Red-headed Finch.
Undaunted by this reverse the Red-heads selected another
nest box, and were soon sitting as industriously as ever. I had
accidently discovered that they were very fond of gentles, and
some of the latter were always thrown in for them twice a day.
This is the more curious because this species is hardly ever to be
seen on the ground searching for insect food. I think this should
be noted because it may have some bearing on the result.
Early in June I heard young birds being fed in the Red-
heads' nest, but it was not until almost the end of the month
that they flew, having been over three weeks and almost a mouth
in the nest.
As we know, young birds when they leave the nest are
usually bunchy, half-feathered, weakly little things, but these
young Red-heads were a splendid sight, being as large, as well
feathered and quite as brightly coloured as the adults--in fact
" tight and perfect." The most remarkable point about them
was that they all closely resembled the adult male having red
heads and 'spangled' breasts, the spanglings being, however,
smaller and of a different character, and their heads of a lighter
shade. Now, it would be an unusual thing for three nestlings
from one nest all to be males (I subsequently concluded that
they were two males and one female), but, even supposing them
to be all males, it appears to be an almost invariable rule for the
young males in nestling plumage to resemble the adult female.
The breast markings of this species are quite worth a little
consideration. In the first place one may note, on taking the
bird in the hand, that the breast feathers are nearly all of a
different length and differently marked, and yet, when lying in
their proper order, they correspond in such a way as to form a
pattern of almost mathematical accuracy. The explanation of
this seems to be that, if one draws an imaginary line across the
breast from wing to wing and examines the feathers in this par-
ticular belt, they will be found to be of similar length and
marking; and further the cells from which these feathers grow
must be spaced at exactly even intervals.
Secondly, it is noteworthy that corresponding feathers of
an adult and immature specimen of the same sex are quite of a
different pattern --the former being "spangled," the latter barred.

THE BREEDING OF THE RED MOUNTAIN
PARTRIDGE DOVE.
Geotrygon montana.
By Sir William Ingram, Bart.
This dove is well named the Partridge Dove ; his size,
compact shape and colour suggest that well known game bird.
Unlike most pigeons and doves, there is no difficulty in dis-
tinguishing the sexes, the hen being a dull olive brown, quite a
quakeress looking lady ; the cock on the other hand having a
reddish or rufous body with a purplish tinge on the plumage on
the upper parts : his cheeks are a pale creamy fawn-colour with
a distinct band of rufous colour under the eye.
The Partridge Dove is the most friendly and amiable of
the numerous dove family in my large aviary, and although
through one of her toes growing twisted under the foot of the

lien bird I had to amputate the toe, the bird seemed as tame as
ever after the operation. This is the second summer I have had
these birds in the same aviary, but only during this season have
they showed any inclination to nest. They built a rather
elaborate nest with sticks and straw on a beam on a spot as high
from the ground as they could find, but after completion it was
usurped by a pair of Leptoptila Doves, so they had to commence
all over again ; the second time choosing an old hamper nailed
against the wall much lower down. Here, although much dis-
turbed by other inmates of the aviary constantly alighting on
the edge of the hamper, they have reared one young bird, which
I believe is the first of the kind ever bred in Great Britain.
The little one has now left the nest and feeds himself: he is of
very dark plumage, the whole upper part being very dark brown,
the feathers edged with rufous, its legs are light red. The egg
left in the nest was partly hatched, and was of a fawnish colour,
not white like most dove's eggs, but perhaps it may have become
darker by being sat upon so long. It very seldom uses its wings
but runs about like a young partridge; evidently these doves
belong to a strictly ground-loving species, and even the adults
seldom leave the floor of the aviary, so it seems strange that they
should choose so elevated a position for their nest.

Sir,--O11 the 26th August my lien Chinese Quail laid a thin-slielled
blue egg upon the sand of my smaller outdoor aviary, and in the most sunny
part of it. My Gouldian-finclies which have a second nest of young ones
in the aviary (I fear the young of the previous nests have all died), broke a
hole in the top of the Quail's egg, and I watched them for some minutes
eating the shell and sucking up the raw albumen, heedless of the spectre of
septicaemia with which our cage-birds have of late years been confronted.
It seems a strange thing, when one considers that the Gouldian-fiuch
never touches soft food, to find that even it cannot resist the delight in that
pabulum which we are expected to believe is so serious a menace to bird-
life, that none but an unreasoning ignoramus would dream of using it.
Alas ! I fear the wise are very few in number. A. G. Bul&apos;r.iCR.

WADERS.
Sir, --I should be very glad of any information as to the proper
management of Stilt Plovers, as I am endeavouring to get some of these
interesting birds. I have a small swamp aviary adapted for small Waders,
and in this place I think Stilts might possibly be kept.
I got a pair of young Avocets on 12th July last. One died at once
owing to delay on the journey. The other, which on arrival was little
more than a nestling and very weak on the leg, has prospered well so far.
Eeing warned of the danger of these birds catching cold through
over-bathing (especially when young) I put my bird in a temporary
enclosure for a fortnight, giving food in a shallow pan partly filled with wet
sand and allowing a bath (an old preserving pan did duty) for a few minutes
only about one o'clock each day.
Mr. Bertling kindly gave me information as to the feeding of
the Avocets at the Zoo., where the birds are iu splendid order. I fed
my young bird on fresh-water shrimps (Gaminarus pulex ), mealworms,
hard-boiled egg, and meat and fish shredded small. All these he ate
greedily.
After bathing, however, even on a hot day, he shivered a good deal
and looked like a drowned rat, and I think a week's wet weather would
have killed him.
At the end of a fortnight I put him into the swamp-aviary where his
feathers speedily began to grow, including those on his cut wing. He
soon became bright and active in his movements in striking contrast to his
apathy 011 arrival, and on the 3rd September I noticed him flying for the
first time.
He is exceedingly tame, and nothing pleases him so much as to take
a mealworm from the hand. He is also very fond of wasp grubs. To 1113^
surprise he seldom wanders into the swamp to hunt for natural food, and
iu this respect is a decided contrast to 1113* Black-tailed Godwit who is
constantly prowling about amongst the rushes and water plants.
The Avocet seems quite content with running about the little sand
beach and at intervals mowing the water with his bill iu a most picturesque
manner. C. Barnby Smith.

Sir,-- Last autumn I asked about introducing Silver Pheasants into
my aviaries and, acting on the advice given, I did so and I have been pleased
with the result. I decided, therefore, to place Pheasants in three more of
my large aviaries, and purchased a cock (1905) Amherst and two hens of
the same year, the latter are pinioned, the cock is not. After I had them
about a week the cock bird took a dislike to one of the hens and, but for
there being plenty of shelter in the form of heaps of brushwood, would
have killed her. If ever she comes out into the open he goes for her, so I
have to feed her under the sticks. Now what I wish to ask is, will he take to
her at pairing time ? Will it be best to remove her until spring ? Would it
be best to divide the aviary by wire netting and let him see her all the time
or not, or is there any other way you would advise ? Also how would you
proceed to introduce another hen to this pen ? I have placed a pair
of Gold Pheasants in another aviary but am told I ought to put two hens
with the cock. Is this necessary ? I do not care to do so unless it is
best. I have not yet decided what kind of Pheasant to introduce into my
third large aviary, but I think of Versicolors. Would you say if they are
easily tamed, or are they always very wild, and are they easy to rear ? I
am told Silvers are easiest reared, next Amhersts, and that Golds are
delicate. I have a this year's Gold and Amherst cock bird : will he breed
this coming spring ? My Silver cock being under one year old did not
fertilize the eggs although the hen laid 22 eggs and was the same age. Also
I have two Silver liens that I have reared this season from eggs that I
bought. How would it be to introduce them to the old birds; would the
cock pair with three hens? For your guidance I might say my aviaries
are all about 12 ft. by 12 ft. or larger. I have purchased Tegetmeier's
" Pheasants" and Horner's " Fancy Pheasants," but they do not quite clear
up these points. F. H. Rudkin.
The Jollowing reply has been sent to Mr. Rudkin :--
Amherst and Golden cocks often take dislikes to certain hens : it is
no use to try and get him accustomed to her. I should get rid of the

lieu. You might try another, but he would very likely treat her just the
same.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.869783804878049" page_id="32720840"  page_num="361" year="" vol="">
It is not necessary to put two hens in with a Golden cock Pheasant.
Versicolor Pheasants are not tame, neither are they easily reared, at least
pure bred ones, and they are very shy layers.
Reeves are far tamer ; they are fair layers, but not very easy to rear.
Neither Gold, Amherst, Silver, nor any cock Pheasant which does not
assume full breeding-plumage in its first season will breed in its first year,
although the hens lay freely their first year. There are a few rare
exceptions to this rule.
I should not be inclined to put more than a cock and two hen
Pheasants in a pen such as described. E. G. B. Meade-Wakdo.

I am aware that many and powerful efforts are being made to lessen
this awful destruction, yet, so far, the result would appear to be trifling. Is
there no one, are there no means, moral or legal, to end this crime ?
The Avicultural Society has a scope; it has an influential member-
ship. I appeal to it. Let me add, no bird-skins are exported from Jamaica.
*******
From such blood-guiltiness the A. S. members are doubtless innocent.
Is there, however, something of a mote in someone's eye ?
I read, and not without interest, of the experiments made in the way
of the acclimatization of birds from hotter countries. Sometimes I wonder
if this or vivisection is the greater cruelty. And I shudder again. When I
read just how near freezing to death some bird has managed to exist and,
withal, look ' cheerful,' I feel sorry for the creature, and know that for one
surviving a dozen will succumb.
One might live in an icehouse or a stokehold : a polar bear might eke
out in a bakehouse, but to pretend the change would be beneficial is absurd.
I write as I feel and as I feel the birds feel. If it can be shown I am
mistaken, so much the better; nor do I presume to teach. M\&apos; purpose is
to remind. - Harotd E. ATTEWELT.

ours suffer from exposure to our climate. Even in the tropics the nights
are often very cold. We believe in artificial warmth for delicate species
during our winter months ; but many tropical species are quite hardy.--E d.].
STAR FINCHES.
Sir, --I had two small birds given me by a friend who had bought
them from a dealer who called them " Ruge Conda." They are a lovely
green with bright scarlet bills and spotted chests. Under this name I fail
to identify them in any bird book. Can you kindly help me in the next
number of the Avicultural Magazine as I think this must be a dealer&apos;s
name for them. I am very anxious to know how to treat them.
(Mrs.) BESSIE Mortimer (Original Member).
There can be no doubt that the dealer's name Ruge Conda is a
corruption of the Latin name ruficauda, and that the species is the Rufous-
tailed Grass-finch ; or the Star-fincli as the Australians call it.
White and spray millet with canary seem to suit these birds well.

A TAME HOUSE MARTIN.

a tame Martin during the winter. It was reared by hand, having been thrown
out of its nest by Sparrows when still blind and featherless. At present it

is in good health and plumage and extremely tame. It flies about the
rooms and comes to the hand or shoulder to rest, nestling down and enjoy-
ing caresses and the warmth of the hand. It has always been fed on
preserved eggs and fresh houseflies, which last, however, it will not catch
for itself, requiring to have them killed and put into its tood vessel where
it pecks them out like a regular cage bird. The lady who reared it is
extremely fond of it and looks forward with anxiety to the time when
houseflies will become scarce. We are anxious to know if you can recom-
mend any substitute for flies as it is not likely that the bird will keep in
health without some insect food. It will not touch ants' eggs either dried
or fresh.
Contrary to Dr. Butler's experience* as narrated in the book on
British birds this Martin is not at all sluggish or greedy. The bird sleeps
in a cocoanut shell lined with cotton wool. It is kept in a warm room and
would of course have a fire when colder weather sets in.
Any information as to the best way of keeping this pretty creature
alive will be most gratefully received. Ethee F. Chawner.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Chaiuner :--
If you can get them in the winter gentles would be the most
suitable food : when I was a boy they could be obtained from fishing-
tackle shops: the caterpillars of the small meal-moth, the grain-moth, or
even those of clothes'-moths would perhaps be even more acceptable.
Then again there are those curious little insects (which harbour under
boxes or tins and which creep into one's mealworm-boxes) called silver-fish
{Lepisma saccharina), I think they might prove useful.
Failing all living insects, I should try scalding the so-called " dried
flies" of commerce and mixing them with the egg supplied to the bird.

From the official list of additions to the Zoological Society's
Collection it would appear that a young bird of this species has been reared
at the Gardens. This however is not the case. One young bird lived until
it was nearly fledged, but died long before it could feed itself; so that this
beautiful species has not yet been successfully bred in captivity.

HYBRID LONG-TAILED AND MASKED GRASSFINCH.

<bodyText confidence="0.9993237" page_id="32720843"  page_num="364" year="" vol="">
A hybrid from a male Long-tailed (Poephila acuticauda) and female
Masked Grassfinch (P. personatci) has recently been reared in my aviary.
When first seen it was being fed b)&apos; the Long-tailed Grassfinch, the only one
in the aviary, so I knew it must be a hybrid ; and as there were two hen
Masked F&apos;iuches which had for some time been on very friendly terms with
the Long-tailed, I had little doubt as to which bird was the female parent.
The young bird was just like a young Masked Finch except that it had
more ,of a " bib." Its bill is now changing from black to yellow, and its
movements remind one most of the Long-tailed Grassfinch, but its voice
is the trumpet note of the Masked Finch. D. Seth-Smith.
