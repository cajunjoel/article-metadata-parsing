OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST NORTH
AMERICAN BREEDING OF THE SPOT-WINGED
WOOD QUAIL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9801000625" page_id="58076017"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
(Odontophorus capueira)
By G. Michael Flieg (St. Louis Zoological Park, Missouri, U.S.A.).
The Spot-Winged Wood Quail, also known as the Capueiria Partridge
or Uru, is a small stocky game-bird found on the ground in the dense
tropical forest of eastern Brazil, Paraguay and northeastern Argentina.
It is very beautiful, but not gaudy. The ventral parts are lead grey,
the back is spotted brown and black, and there is red bare skin around
the eyes. It has cinnamon eyebrows and a dark spot behind the eye.
The overall size is just a bit larger than that of the Bob White ( Colinus
virginianus). This species was fed on game bird crumbles and trout chow.
I It was kept in a heated barn when the weather dropped to less than 45 0 F.
These birds are kept in the barn normally from November through March
and have free choice at other times barring very inclement weather.
In April 1965 three Spot-Winged Wood Quail began to build a nest in
their cage at the St. Louis Zoo. They were housed with Cinereus
Tinamou ( Nothoprocta cinereus ) in a pheasant aviary 7x3m. Although
the sexes were undetermined, we have since found out that two males and
ane female were involved in nest building. They gathered nesting material
*by picking it up and throwing it over their shoulders to the next
bird in the line, finally transporting it to the nest site. The unique nest
nf the genus Odontophorus is domed and about 40 x 50 cm. in size and
is similar to the nests of many neotropical passerines. The domed
nest took about three days to complete, and five white, size 40 x 28 mm.
ggs were laid at daily intervals. These were removed and a second
lutch of three eggs was laid about two weeks later. Three eggs hatched
nn 14th May 1965 after an incubation period of 26-27 days, although one
nipped 10th May 1965, four days prior to hatching. The newly hatched
j /oung looked very much like Bob White, ( Colinus virginianus ), but were
i bit larger with blood red beaks and dark legs.
Although they grew very quickly at first, when they reached about
lalf the size of the adult they slowed down and did not reach full size
intil about two months old.

2 C. J. O. HARRISON--HELPERS AT THE NEST IN THE PURPLE GALLINULE
At this age they still had not developed contour feathers on the back and |
rump. At the age of three and a half months they could be detected j
from the adults only by darker colouration and grey cheeks.
This breeding by the St. Louis Zoological Garden was cited as a first
in North America by the American Game Bird Breeders Cooperative
Federation. We would surely like to know if it could be a first captive
world breeding and would appreciate hearing to the contrary.

HELPERS AT THE NEST IN THE PURPLE j
GALLINULE
(Porphyrio porphyrio)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993435290322581" page_id="58076018"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
It is well known that the young of the first brood of the Moorhen,
Gallinula chloropus , in each year will help to feed the young of the second
brood, often taking food from the parents and passing it on to the younger
chicks; but such sociability ceases at the end of the season. Ridpath
(1964) found that the large flightless rail, the Tasmanian Native Hen,
Tribonyx mortierii , might form groups of three or four birds instead of
pairs, and that such groups, which remained together persistently,
consisted of several males with one female. This social behaviour does I
not, however, appear to have been more widely noted in the rail family,
but as in the case of the Purple Gallinule, P. porphyrio , this may be due
to the fact that behaviour which becomes apparent in an open aviary is
very difficult to observe with much more timid birds in the depths of a j
swamp or reedbed.
The Snowdon Aviary of the London Zoo houses, among other species, I
some individuals of the pale-headed Indian race of the Purple Gallinule, I
P. porphyrio polioceplialus (this is the Old World species, not the North I
American Purple Gallinule, Porphyrula martinica). The birds of this I
race are a light purplish blue with a paler, whitish head, and the usual I
white under tail coverts and red bill and legs. They have bred in this I
aviary for several successive seasons. On a visit during July 1968 I
noticed two adults with three half-sized young in blackish down with I
smooth foreheads. A third adult was collecting a bill full of grass and I
leaves which looked like nest material. It walked towards the other two, I
one of which joined it, followed by two of the chicks. The third bird I
dropped the material it was holding and these two adults and young went I
to a food tray where the adults fed the young. Even at this stage one of I
the young tried to emulate adults by holding food up in one foot and I
balancing on the other, although not with complete success. The other |
adult and other young one remained at the nest-site. As far as I was aware
the adults should have been a pair and the young of a previous year.

Next year, at the end of August 1969, I made further observations.
The aviary appeared to have seven apparently adult birds. There was
one group of four which moved around the lower part of it, near the canal.
There were another two which kept together and did not normally approach
to within more than nine or ten feet of the others, but would occasionally
pass more closely when moving from one part to another or to food trays,
and appeared to share some of the area. One odd bird was alone in an
upper comer of the aviary. It was not possible to distinguish any
obviously immature birds among these. From my observations it appeared
that the group of four constituted a social unit, but there was no sign of
any interaction with the other two birds nearby, nor was it possible to
assign any particular role to any one of the four, as the following notes
indicate.
I had previously seen three of the four squatting close together, one
apparently on a nest, near the S.W. corner of the aviary. Two were now T
resting with bodies pressed together on a more central site near the main
pool and among growing plants, no. 1 just resting, no. 2 with a wing held
a little apart from the body, the pale bill and dark head of a chick just
visible under the wing. Xo. 2 broke off small pieces of surrounding
plants and fed them to the chick. Xo. 3 stood near no. 2 and also fed
the chicks at internals. From subsequent brief views at least three chicks
were present. Occasionally no. 3 passed food items to no. 2 who gave them
to the chicks. Xo. 4 appeared carrying a piece of food and broke off
pieces which it passed to no, 3 who fed the chicks directly or passed it to
no. 2 for them. Xo. 4 moved off, returned with more food and this time
stood near no. 3 and passed the food directly to no. 2 who fed the chicks
with it. After a pause, no. 4 thrust its head and neck under no. 2, forced
its way under and pushed no. 2 off the chicks, taking over the brooding.
Xo. 2 now left the nest and walked to where no, 3 was breaking up a
large piece of food held down in its foot. Xo 3 then began passing
small pieces of food to no. 2. Some of these were eaten, but in several
instances a small piece of food was passed backwards and forwards a
number of times before finally being eaten by one or the other. The piece
of food would be held in the bill by one bird, and taken from the bill by
the other bird. Later I noticed that when young were being fed, if a
piece of food proved too large for them to swallow, the adult would
repeatedly take it back from the bill of the young one and then offer it
again; and if two adults were present they might repeatedly take it from
each other&apos;s bill before passing it back to the chick. The repeated taking
of the fragment from another bird's bill appears to result in the food
being broken into successively smaller pieces; and I think that this passing
back and forth, and retrieving from the bill of the chick, is behaviour
which results in portions too large to swallow being broken down to a
convenient size for eating. The passing of small morsels between the
two adults in the instance above probably arose from the fact that their
feeding was associated with the presence of young birds.

K. S. HARRAP--BREEDING OF THE LARK-LIKE BUNTING
After a break in observation I returned later to find one bird brooding
the young while the others were scattered, odd individuals bringing food
at intervals. Towards the end of the afternoon two of the four birds were
seen collecting bills full of leaves and grass, apparently nest material, and
passing this to the bird brooding the chicks who built the material up
around itself as a nest, probably a temporary structure on which to brood
the young.

Lark-like Buntings, Fringillaria impetuani , are a pale edition of the
well-known Cinnamon Rock Bunting, Fringillaria tahapisi , their size
being about that of the European Linnet.

This bird is very nomadic in habit and will invade an area, stay for
several months then completely disappear, especially here in Rhodesia.
A bird of dry country, it seems to favour Matabeleland which is in the
southern part of the country. One of these invasions was in 1962 and
several were trapped by local aviculturists. My pair were two of these
and, as they showed no signs of breeding over the years, were classified
as two of a sex. The birds came into my possession in 1968 and were put
in an aviary 20 ft. x 16 ft. with Rock Buntings, Golden Breasted Buntings,
Finch Larks, Quail Finches, Waxbills of several species, and Doves as
companions.

The two birds completely ignored one another until August of 1969
when one was seen singing lustily from a rock in the aviary, stopping only
to chase the other round the aviary with drooped wings, not unlike the
courtship of the domestic canary. A week or so later I missed the female
and on searching through the aviary I found, her sitting on two brown
speckled eggs in a little nest made at the base of a large clump of bamboo.
The composition of the nest was mainly coarse grass bents and small
broken twigs, the lining consisted mainly of the fine down from Pampas
Grasses and Hessian taken from an old sack which had been placed in the
aviary to attract white ants (termites).
Both eggs hatched after being incubated by the female only for about
twelve days. The chicks were covered in a long white down but un-
fortunately I could not see the skin colour as the hen sat very close. Pin
feathers were observed growing on the young at a week old and both left
the nest at fourteen days, their tails being half grown.

<bodyText confidence="0.999606090909091" page_id="58076021"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
Both birds assisted in feeding the young and became very tame,
waiting for me to put in their daily feed of termites. The male would go
to the nest and feed the brooding female who in turn passed on the ants
to the young. Later as the young grew both adults would fill up with
ants then regurgitate them to the young. I do not think that the parents
fed seed to the chicks until they were about nine days old. As the aviary
is a planted one I should say that the old birds caught a lot of live food for
themselves. Mixed seed and grit was given as the staple diet, also cattle
lick (rock salt) of which all the birds are very fond.
The young birds are now self-supporting and the female is already
incubating two more eggs in a new nest not far from the old one.

(Sturnus nigricollis)
By A. E. Hall (Lower
Haselor, Evesham, Worcestershire, England)
This species is resident throughout Burma generally, across to southern
China and is probably more widespread than this but little seems to have
been published about this bird. A hand-reared pair was sent to Mr.
W. R. Partridge in March 1967 from Hong Kong by Dr. K. C. Searle.
The length of the birds is n inches. The bill is black, iris pale buff-
white and the legs and feet are pale bluish pink. The elliptical shaped
area of bare skin around the eye is yellowish in the adult male and bluish
in the adult female. The head, breast, rump and underparts are white,
the neck and back is black. A narrow band of white runs across the base
of the hind neck and joins up on each side with the white on the breast
giving the bird a completely separate black collar. The wings are black
with a patch of white flecks on the shoulder, the thumb (false wing or
bastard wing) is white with a broken white line running from that point
across the tips of the median wing coverts and the secondaries are also
tipped with white. The tail is black tipped with a narrow band of white.
The white rump is only seen in flight.
For a few weeks after arrival they were housed in a large cage in the
bird-room and settled down quickly even though their diet was changed
slightly. Fruit, in the form of apple and orange with the occasional piece
of banana and a few grapes, was taken readily and mealworms were
relished. Coarse insectile food and raw minced meat soon formed an
equal part of the diet to the fruit as the quantity of mealworms was
reduced. Maggots were left and only eaten when other more desirable
foods were finished. As the birds settled down, fruit was reduced to
just soft, sweet apple.
When all signs of hard frost had gone and spring was set in its ways the &apos;
birds were moved to a planted aviary measuring 22 ft. x 8 ft. with an
adjoining shelter of 10 ft. x 8 ft. Since we knew little about the breeding
habits of these birds they were furnished with a hollow log hung about
7 ft. from the ground as well as there being many possible nest sites in
the bushes. In the summer of 1967 they chose a site on top of the nest-
log and began building a large untidy nest, mostly of dead grasses from
the aviary floor and hay which was supplied to them. Eggs were laid,
incubated, and hatched but the chicks were lost in the early stages of
rearing. The birds remained in the aviary throughout the winter and
in the summer of 1968 began to build once again. This time they chose
a site on a wire platform in the corner of the aviary and everything went j
well until the chicks were about a fortnight old when unfortunately they
were lost once again.

In 1969 they seemed to start in a haphazard manner, carrying nesting
material to many possible sites, then quite suddenly after two weeks of
this undecidedness they chose an entirely new site about 6 ft. from the
ground in an elder bush, and had completed the nest in three days.
On the 23 rd May I noticed during feeding that only the cock was visible
and this continued until 28th May when the lien appeared. The nest
contained five eggs and this was the only time that I saw the hen off the
nest during incubation. The first sign of anything happening came on
10th June when I saw the shell of a hatched egg on the ground. Maggots
were fed ad-lib. and on 12th June another shell appeared plus the sounds
of chicks in the nest. The consumption of maggots began rising and
after the first few days a small quantity of mealworms were supplied also.
The amount of live-food being utilized by the birds reached a peak of
one and a half pints of maggots and a handful of mealworms daily on
22nd June, then remained constant for five days before starting to reduce.
Nest inspection on 28th June revealed only one chick, quite well feathered,
and the remains of a chick which must have died a few days earlier. The
parent birds were living almost entirely on live food themselves because
the amount of minced meat and apple being taken was negligible. On
; 1st July the chick was sitting on the edge of the nest entrance and two
days later it had left the nest completely and was hopping about on the
ground and lower branches of the bushes. After seeing the chick out
in the open I realized that its legs were twisted and splayed as if due to
calcium deficiency. This chick died a few days later and the parents
very quickly began building again but due to the overgrown state of the
bushes I did not know where.
Again the hen was lost from view and on 30th July, after seeing both
birds out in the open, I inspected the old nest to find that it had been
renovated and contained partly incubated eggs. An empty shell appeared
on 4th August and again maggots were fed ad-lib., but this time with
additions to try to overcome the deficiencies of the chick which was lost
earlier. To one pint of maggots I added one teaspoon of " Stress "
calcium and phosphorous powder, one teaspoon of Gevral protein food
and one c.c. of "Abidec " multi-vitamin. The birds took to this quite
readily and an ad-lib. supply continued until consumption reached one
pint daily then they were restricted to this amount. Minced meat was
increased to meet the demand and a few mealworms, pupae and beetles
were given also. On 22nd August a few maggots were left over from the
day before, previous to this everything had been eaten and food-pots were
strewn everywhere in the search for live food. Three days later a chick
was sitting on a branch just outside the nest and over the next few days
it ventured further afield. This youngster appeared quite strong and
showed no signs of any outward deformities, then on 29th August it was
found dead. For the first time I saw two more chicks in the seclusion
of the elder bush so every attempt had to be made to save them.

A. E. HALL--BREEDING THE BLACK-NECKED STARLING
A quick post-mortem revealed that suffocation due to gape worms could
have been the cause of death, everything else appearing to be normal and
the bird in excellent condition bodily. " Thibenzole " powder was
mixed into a solution with water following instructions on the packet and
given at the rate of i c.c. per lb. body weight. The dead chick weighed
4 ozs. and I estimated each parent to be about 6 ozs., then put i J c.c. of
the solution on the maggots, rather than risk possible losses from catching
to give direct dosage to each bird. This treatment was omitted for a day
then given again the following day and once a week thereafter as a
precaution.
The juvenile plumage is greyish fawn and brownish black with rather
indistinct borders between the two colours. Adult plumage is attained
in the first moult.
After the chicks had been out of the nest for three weeks I had to
transfer them to another aviary because the adult hen was driving them
around in an unsociable manner. The youngsters, now on their own,
feed entirely on raw minced meat, leaving the maggots, both with and
without the additives mentioned earlier, untouched. By the end of
October they had completed their first moult and now look exactly like
their parents.
The adult birds made another attempt at breeding after the youngsters
had been removed but gave up after two eggs had been laid. I examined
the nest and found it approximately 18 in. in diameter and of the cross
section shown. The egg measurements were i J in. x  |in. and of a light
turquoise blue colour.
As described above A. E. Hall has bred the Black-necked Starling
Sturnus nigricollis. It is believed that this may be a first success. Any
member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the
Hon. Secretary.

By F. Meaden (Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England)
I have, for many years, been keeping birds of British and European
species, trying to discover the conditions and diet which will keep them
in good health in aviaries and induce them to breed. The birds described
here were kept in a suburban garden at Slough, where the aviaries, at
first at the bottom of the garden, gradually spread over a large part of it.
In order to check what was happening I kept a record of the various
nestings on large cards which could be filed to form a permanent record.
The following account gives details of some of the breeding achieved.
Since it is difficult to discover with certainty which of these species have,
or have not, been bred in aviaries I had not attached very great importance
to these, with the possible exception of the Waxwings; but the Assistant
Editor informs me that there appear to be no adequate published records
of the breeding of these particular species, and has asked me to prepare
these notes on them.

COMMON WHITETHROATS

<bodyText confidence="0.999659739130435" page_id="58076025"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
A pair of Common Whitethroats, Sylvia communis , after spending the
winter of 1953 in an unheated birdroom were, in early April 1954, given
the freedom of an 8 ft. x 3 ft. x 7 ft. outdoor aviary built alongside the
garden fence on what had previously been a flowei bed. The roof,
although of wire, was almost covered by polythene sheet, the rear along
one of the 8 ft. sides was overgrown with hops, and one end was shut off
completely by a dense lilac bush, which also sent up a host of shoots
through the earth of the aviary floor. The end portion where the lilac
branches encroached into the enclosure was packed with gorse to a height
of about two or three feet and this, with a blackberry bush growing in its
midst, the lilac and hops all contributed to provide quite a dense growth.
The remainder of the enclosure was fairly clear except for a turf or two of
grass, a small wood ants' nest and the birds' bathing facilities. On
14th April the birds were seen carrying some small white feathers into
the gorse. After throwing down a few mealworms at the opposite end
of their aviary to keep the birds occupied, we removed a ply-wood sheet
which hid an observation hole into the bush. We found that a nest was
almost completed. When we provided a wad of dog hair they showed
t no further interest in feathers and lined the nest fully with the latter
material. On 17th April the first egg appeared and four more were laid
; on consecutive days. Three young had hatched by 5th May and we
noticed a sudden change in the parent birds' food consumption; little
fruit was now taken but the Farex and maggot intake was doubled, and

mealworms were cleared from the dish directly they were given. Whether
ants were taken I do not know, there were however no eggs at that time.
The hops which covered the side of this aviary were absolutely smothered
with greenfly, the back of each leaf being thick with them. These too
must have formed a large part of the nestlings diet because the parents
were often seen working the vine-like stems. The pear so avidly taken
prior to rearing was left almost untouched but by 25th May the soft pulp
of the fruit was once again taken and only the hollowed-out skin remaining.
Previous to 28th May only two young had been seen moving around the
aviary, but on that day we observed three and the two adults. One
youngster seemed very large but two were far smaller. Even so all were
seen to be taking grated cheese, Farex, pear, grated carrot, maggots,
greenfly and even the soft food and mealworms. The old hen died
suddenly on 7th June. She appeared perfectly fit in the morning but was
dead at 6.30 p.m. The young and the adult male were all in excellent
condition. The young were now also taking soaked household currants,
a favourite with many warblers. With Autumn the four remaining birds
fed almost exclusively on ripe elderberries. The amount of weight which
was now put on was amazing and there was now little if any disparity in
size or weight of any of the birds.

NUTHATCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707391304348" page_id="58076026"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
A pair of Nuthatches, Sitta europaea , were given me by a friend in the
autumn of 1954. They were overwintered in a large aviary with a number
of other species, but made themselves a nuisance by stealing the sunflower
seeds intended for the finches, however great the quantity, and concealing
them in crevices and in the ground at the foot of wooden supports. They
were therefore moved to another aviary, an all-wire structure of irregular
shape, about 9 ft. x 6 ft., which they shared with a pair of Reed Buntings
Emberiza schoeniclus. A major part of the aviary was occupied by a
pond 6 ft. x 3 ft. with a lot of water iris. The aviary was built around the
trunk of an old, 30-foot apple tree, the enclosed part of the trunk being
covered with honeysuckle and having a " V " shaped fork into which a
nest-box was secured. The box was of a horizontal type, made of wood
and covered with bark, and with one side fitted so that it could be removed.
Maggots, mealworms, grated cheese, beetles, earwigs, a marrow bone, suet,
soaked sunflower seed and Avi-vite soft food was the standard diet, and
in addition either the Reed Buntings or Nuthatches were taking tadpoles
and small frogs from the pond, for on a ledge of the aviary were the remains
of dozens of these creatures.
During the season the Reed Buntings tried to nest, building low in a
gorse bush, but the Nuthatches destroyed four nests of eggs, which I took
to be sheer vandalism on their part. Friends had visited us one Sunday
in June 1955, one intending to take some photographs of the birds, the
other merely to see the collection. We were all relaxing in the sun when

one called out, " Do you know your Nuthatches are feeding young? "
My immediate thought was that, as was their customary habit, these birds
were carrying up and hiding food. However, when I investigated the
box to prove that he was wrong I found four strong youngsters with
feathers just breaking through. The parents .continued to rear them on
the diet provided without difficulty.
In the autumn bickering between the birds had commened in earnest
and since space was short we decided that the Nuthatches had to go.
We had at that time a flat near Kensington Gardens and thought that this
would be an ideal spot. We housed the birds separately for the winter,
having sexed them as three definite pairs, and in April 1956 we liberated
the old pair and one of the young pairs. They were released very close
to Bayswater Road, nearly opposite Lancaster Gate Church. An interval
of 25 minutes was allowed between releasing the pairs, and in each case
they remained within a few feet of each other, climbing the trees as though
they had known the place for years. We chose this area mainly for
sentimental reasons, having spent many leisure hours watching the park's
birds. The releasing of these birds had a rather unexpected conclusion.
In the London Evening News there appeared later a report entitled
" Rare birds back in Royal Park after 50 years " and referring to the
nuthatches. We notified organizations which would be interested of the
part we had played in this new sighting. This resulted in correspondence
between the Nature Conservancy and ourselves, clearing up the matter.
However, it is nice to know that the birds did breed at a later date.

WILLOW WARBLERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997741333333333" page_id="58076027"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
An adult pair of Willow Warblers, Phylloscopus trochilus , were given
me in the autumn of 1959 by an old friend, Mr. R. C. Tout. I kept them
over winter in an unheated birdroom and put them out in spring into
one of the aviaries along the side of the garden. This structure was
8 ft. x 7 ^ x 3 ft. The rear was covered by hops and convolvolus, at one
end a wisteria completely hid 2 ft. of the structure, while at the other end
and over a fair amount of the aviary front was a well-grown grape-vine.
Inside the aviary grew Everlasting Pea.
With all this cover observation was not easy, but on 3rd June i960 we
noticed that there were more birds in their enclosure than there should
have been. After watching for the best part of an hour we found that
at least three young were being fed by the old pair. Further examination
of the aviary from the inside revealed a nest low down in an old dead fir
which was overgrown with convolvulus. The adult pair, normally so
tame, were now behaving like mad things, calling frantically and keeping
as far as possible from me. One youngster had joined them and the other
two went to ground. For fear of treading on them I had to retieat from
their enclosure.

The fouled and used nest was composed of grasses, honeysuckle skin
from branches growing in the aviary, what appeared to be old leaves of
iris, and the lining was of hair and feathers. They must have worked
really hard to gather all these items, for I had provided no nest material,
being under the impression that both had sung and that they were two
birds of the same sex. Two young were of the same size as the parents
but the third was a weakling. From the nest I recovered the body of a
fourth chick so dried into the hair and feathers that no age could be
assessed from the remains. From this data it would seem that they must
have nested about the first week in May.
In the enclosure was a nest of wood ants acquired from a nearby
beechwood and a bamboo cane pushed through the wire netting, inserted
into the anthill, and moved from side to side, uncovered many pupae
daily. They were small but were avidly taken. It was noticed that if
an ant got onto a bird's leg the bird would peck at it in fear and fly off.
All the climbing plant growth within the aviary produced much greenfly
and a profusion of mixed insect life. We saw the adults feeding the young
on greenfly, but since the maggot dish was emptied more quickly than
usual I imagine that these too were being taken for them. What had
first caught our notice was the male actually regurgitating a sort of white
liquid. It was probably only Farex but the regurgitation surprised me.
The food prior to the young being observed had been grated cheese,
Avi-vite softfood, wax-moth larvae (normally only given at week-ends
when time permitted), ripe pear, fruit fly which they took on the wing or
from a bucket containing over-ripe fruit, and Farex to which we added
calcium phosphate during the breeding season. Our only addition now
was a handful of mealworms in a dish at their late afternoon feed, together
with increased quantities of the other foods.
According to my record card, on 6th June all the young were thriving
and searching for insects through the aviary vegetation. One male was
rather bare about the head, and the adult male was seen to attack it when
it ventured close to him or the female, whether because it was a male or .
because of its begging for food I do not know. 1 he runt of the three had
now improved, and although still a shade smaller in size was as strong on
the leg and wing as the others. A number of people saw the young, but
none were more surprised than I by the successful rearing of them.
Had I even suspected that they were a true pair at the start, or that some
attempt to nest and breed was being made, I would certainly have gone
to a lot of trouble to assist; but I feel certain that the abundant supply of
greenfly weighed the balance in their favour.

breeding these birds in the magazine (Meaden 1964) but did not give the
actual nesting account. The flock of a dozen or so birds was kept in a
fairly large aviary with overall dimensions about 30 ft. x 14 ft. x 7 ft.
They were sociable birds and even in the breeding season would rest
within inches of each other, the males showing no territorial aggression
even when nesting unless an interloper actually alighted at the nest, when
the reaction was limited to a forward threat with widely gaping mouth.
The flock was not made up of equal pairs. Females predominated in a
ratio of about two to one. The breeding displays have been described
elsewhere (Meaden 1964; Meaden and Harrison 1965).
It was in June that our birds started nesting. As usual dried chickweed
and grasses formed the basis of the nest, some birds using home-made
nest-baskets, others using natural twigs. All the nests were lined with
animal hair or fur, and with vegetable down from seed-heads. There
were at one time seven nests in use, the two closest being about 9 in.
apart at the most, while one of the lowest I have known was about 3 J ft.
off the floor. Most were under some sort of overhead cover. The
enclosure had a small apex roof covering a through path and two nest
were built up under the corrugated plastic roof; while others were under
a felted i-ft. wide sheltered portion around the perimeter of the aviary
roof. Apart from this proximity to overhead cover, the nests themselves
were in relatively open sites.
The hens all went to nest within a few days of each other, the first
seeming to trigger off the impulse in the others; although courtship display
had been witnessed since early spring and the displays had increased in
frequency until one could hardly ever look into the enclosure without
seeing some birds displaying. In addition to being highly sociable among
themselves these birds were very tame, although all these northern species
seem to be highly tractable. I found that if, when a hen was brooding,
I moved a finger towards the tip of hei bill and then quickly drew it back,
she would tend to snap at it. I took advantage of this behaviour and after
concentrating for a few days on the hen which appeared to be the most
co-operative I had her snapping a mealworm, maggot, waxmoth larva,
sowthistle head or even a small blob of Farex from my fingertip. I carried
on with this procedure until she readily took whatever was offered. The
females were normally fed by the male when incubating and in the early
stages when the young were in the nest, and to some extent this taking of
food from my fingers might have been an extension of this behaviour.
This female was one of the earliest to go down, and the chicks hatched
on 14th June after an incubation period of approximately 14 days. I
usually take an annual holiday at this period of the breeding season and
luckily, on the day the young hatched, a good supply of fresh wood ant
pupae had been collected from a nearby locality. Although a few pupae
had been given prior to this, we were now able to offer dishes of them,
and in addition the co-operative hen was continually offered them while

she sat on the nest. I cannot recall ever seeing her off the nest while
with eggs or small young, though she might have left it during my
absences from the aviary. Now, with newly-hatched young, immedi-
ately we fed her with ant pupae, waxmoth larvae, or Farex she would
raise herself up, reach down and feed the chicks. Since on the day this
first happened I had been able to check earlier that only two of the eggs
were hatched some of this food may have provided their first meal. At
this time we had started to use a high protein invalid food, Casilan, of
which a friend had given me a little and which we sprinkled on maggots
and mealworms, and now also on the food offered to the Waxwings. We
continued to feed this bird on the nest frequently and this extra food, in
addition to that brought by the male, was probably critical in that the
young of this brood survived to fledge while others did not.
In other years we had lost the young, apparently because they were
choked by soaked currants given them by the adults. With the hatching
of these young I was anxious to prevent this happening again without
suddenly removing a major part of the food supply and possibly impairing
the fitness of the birds or causing discomfort to those not nesting. We
finally decided to mince the currants so that even if they were fed to the
young they would not choke them. We found, however, that the intake
of currants stopped drastically in any case at this period, and since apple
was still available in quantity and since all the birds were now taking ant
pupae in addition to the usual basic diet there was little harm in stopping
the supply of currants for a short while.
In the nest where the hen had extra food four young hatched but only
three were reared. The young in other nests reached varying stages up
to five days and I feel that the losses were probably due to the impossi-
bility of providing sufficient live food of the ant pupae type for a flock of
12 adults and three or four broods of young all requiring it at once, with
the result that each only received a limited supply. The male was not
seen to feed the young directly until they were seven or eight days old.
The three young fledged at about a fortnight, at the beginning of July.
About two months later they began to moult into adult plumage. In
doing so they went into a very heavy moult. I wondered whether this
was due to the relatively warm weather. Waxwings seem to suffer from
the heat and I had noticed that the incubating females would sit with
open bills, or rise slightly on the nest in apparent discomfort on warm days.
The young ones moulted so heavily that they could not fly up to their
usual roost perches and therefore roosted in a more open part of the aviary.
They became saturated and chilled during a very heavy rainstorm and
two subsequently died, only the one surviving through to full adulthood.
There is a great deal of nonsense written about this species, including
recommending as a staple diet food such as bread and milk, which might
help as an addition but which is otherwise a poor diet item, or the with-
holding of some normal foods such as fruits for fear they might stain the

plumage; while writers without breeding experience solemnly recommend
only one pair to an aviary. Some of our birds had been with us for 13
years when they were stolen and one must have been 15 years old since
it was fully adult when it first came. I am certain from my experience
that this is one of the simpler birds to keep, healthy and in a wonderful
plumage.
As regards the diet, I would still recommend the foods I mentioned in
the previous article--i.e. soaked household currants (strained before use),
grated carrot, greenfood such as brassicas, spinach, watercress, comfrey,
dandelion or similar plants, Farex mixed with milk, softfood, small
quantities of grated Cheddar cheese, together with an occasional pinch
of calcium phosphate and a few drops of multivitamin. This together
with plenty of sweet apple.
A dish of maggots and similar live food is necessary at some times of
year; but in my experience the Waxwings almost completely dispense with
live food in winter, unless the diet is deficient in other respects, in which
case they may take all kinds of exceptional foods. Their intake of live
food rises to a peak in July and August when they would be feeding young.
Berries of Mountain Ash, Elderberry, Blackberry, Berberis and other
berries are very valuable parts of the diet when in season. We give
Sowthistle with seedheads which are pulled off and swallowed whole, the
base going first and the downy end disappearing down the throat last.
This does not seem exceptional since they are said to take similar soft,
ripe seedheads in the wilds. I am doubtful about keeping them with
seedeaters that require hemp in the diet since the Waxwings will remove
and eat these seeds immediately, and I am not sure that the cumulative
effect may not be harmful and overfattening.

1 6 D. HOLYOAK--OBSERVATIONS ON A PAIR OF GREEN BROADBILLS
OBSERVATIONS ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF
A PAIR OF GREEN BROADBILLS
(Calyptomena viridis)
By David Holyoak (London, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.989930921052632" page_id="58076032"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
During April and May 1969 I made brief notes on the behaviour of a
pair of captive Green Broadbills ( Calyptomena viridis) whilst studying
other birds at the London Zoo. Virtually nothing has been published
regarding the calls and behaviour of this species, so it seems worth
recording these observations.
The Green Broadbill is a plump, short-tailed bird, rather larger than
a Starling, from the forests of Borneo. The plumage is emerald green
throughout in the female, with black wing-bars and a black spot behind
the eye in the male bird. The bill is partly hidden by stiff feathers
growing from the base. These observations were made on a male and a
female kept in a cage about 5 ft. x 8 ft. x 12 ft. high with several growing
plants and numerous perches, in a large heated room. Even for captive
birds they were rather lethargic, remaining perched except for infrequent
bursts of fast whirring flight, and visits to food trays on the cage floor.
Both birds have been heard to give a variety of high-pitched piping
calls, sounding variously like kweea varying to kwee-weer\ and a high
tui-tor call. These notes were given in a wide variety of circumstances,
and some of them probably function as contact calls. A distinctive, soft,
but penetrating, kzvoi kwoi kwoi call, repeated about five to ten times,
was often given by both birds; the head of the calling bird being bobbed
in time with each note. This is probably an alarm call, as it was most
often given when I was very close to the wires of the cage, and when the
wires were rattled.
The flight intention movements have two components common in
passerines, a quick upward flick of the wing-tips in which they are lifted .
up to a centimetre or so, and at higher intensity, a quick crouching
movement.
The appearance of these birds can change abruptly as they fluff or sleek
their plumage, but besides the fact that the female often fluffed as a
response to slight aggression from the male, and when soliciting copulation,
it was not possible to investigate this with a single captive pair.
Copulation was seen twice, and the associated behaviour was similar
each time. First the male hopped towards the female and perched on a
branch near to, and facing her. He then gaped widely two or three
times, bending the upper mandible back to a remarkable extent and
exposing the bright orange-pink interior of the bill. Before the gaping
movements and interspersed with them the head was tilted back away
from the female with the neck feathers fluffed. On both occasions the

By S. T. Johnstone (The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge,
Gloucestershire, England)
Although the Wildfowl Trust started in 1946, it was not until 1961
that we obtained our first Flamingos. These were 12 Chilean, followed
by more Chilean the same year, and later by a consignment of Greater and
Lesser Flamingos from Kenya. In the case of the Chileans, these had
been bought from dealers in Holland and had arrived each with the legs
folded in a flour bag. Of course, the journey was very short and the
birds appeared to be in excellent condition. Unfortunately, the con-
signment of. Greaters and Lessers from Kenya had travelled in crates,
in which they were in a standing position. The divisions in which each
bird was put consisted of rather rough sacking. They had rubbed their
hocks on this sacking and, as a result, the abrasions so caused had become
infected. This appeared to effect the Lesser Flamingos more so than the
Greater and we had considerable losses in the former. Infection of the
joints of the legs of Flamingos would seem to be a most difficult condition
to deal with. Of the antibiotics used Chloromycetin was the most success-
ful in effecting a cure, but experience shows that great care must be
exercised in the design of the travelling crates. Caribbean Flamingos
were not obtained until the following year, when Antwerp Zoo very
generously presented us with a pair. Subsequently these were added to
by birds purchased from Florida. In 1965, we obtained our first Andean
and James's Flamingos from Mr. Cordier.
Flamingos are related to wildfowl, but I am afraid our knowledge of
their husbandry and their feeding habits, etc., was not our strong point,
and, having decided that these birds should be added to our collection,
it was imperative that we increased our " know-how " as to keeping them.
So whilst collecting the various forms we were, at the same time, visiting
experts in the Zoos seeking their advice, not only as to how the birds,
should be fed, but also how to retain their colour and how they should be
kept in winter. The information obtained from the principal collections
both in Europe and America varied a great deal but from it we have
developed our own method of keeping the birds, of providing adequate
nesting sites, and of the way in which they should be fed.
The collection now consists of some 225 birds. 37 Rosy, 74 Chilean,
20 Andean, 50 Lessers, 30 Greaters and 14 James's.
In order to facilitate their breeding, we designed and built Flamingo
atolls, this involved a considerable amount of work. The draining of
the ponds and then building up with hard-core and rubble two banana
shape ridges, leaving at the ends an opening between them. The rubble
was covered with concrete smoothed down and at an angle of 30 degrees
to the bottom of the ponds. Between the ridges was then filled with

mud and sea sand, a small entrance at each end left so that water could
flow in and keep the mixture of mud and sand at the right consistency for
the Flamingos to build their mounds. Encouragement was offered them
in the form of concrete replicas of nests, several built close together at
one end of the island.
It was not until 1967 that any nest building activity was apparent. In
this year the Rosy Flamingos built a number of nests. They even planted
a little mud on some of the concrete replicas. There was slight activity
amongst the Chilean Flamingos as well, but no eggs were laid. However,
in May 1968 the activity amongst the Caribbean Flamingos was such that
in a relatively short time some 16 nests were built. In the middle of May,
two eggs were laid on successive days. One must explain that the pen
where the Caribbean Flamingos are kept is overlooked by our Restaurant
and tea terrace, which is separated from the sward of the pen by a low
stone wall. Although a fairly continuous watch was kept to see that
visitors did not enter the pen and disturb the two sitting Flamingos, one
person we had forgotten about, and, one day, when no member of the
Staff was near, the window cleaner arrived to clean the outside of the
restaurant windows. He went over the wall with his ladders and imme-
diately the incubating Flamingos left their nests. Fortunately a visitor
realized something was wrong and came for a member of the Staff. The
window cleaner immediately left the pen and the birds came back to their
island but one of the two birds at once rejected the egg from its nest,
whilst the other one sat down quite comfortably. The rejected egg was
replaced, but the flamingo again rolled it out. It was thought that if we
continued to return the egg we would cause the second bird to do likewise,
therefore one more attempt was made with a wooden egg and the rejected
egg was placed in an incubator. Likewise the wooden egg was rolled out.
On the 14th June, slight tapping and squeaking was heard from the egg
in the incubator. We decided that the possibility of rearing a young
freshly hatched flamingo was beyond us. We could not reproduce the
regurgitated food with which the parents feed the young. The remaining
: egg, that was being incubated by the parent, was therefore examined and
:ound to be infertile. It was exchanged for the live egg and within 24
lours the first flamingo to be hatched in Britain made its appearance.
The hatching was followed by foul weather for about a fortnight and one
saw the chick on occasions almost covered in mud. It did not leave the
 |lest during this time and was first seen out of the nest on the fifteenth
lay. Both birds shared brooding and both birds fed the young one at
requent intervals of about 20 minutes; the male taking the major share
)f this work. After 17 days, the downy young was seen to be attempting to
eed itself although its main sustenance came from its parents. This was
continued until the bird was almost fully grown and it was seen that the
larent birds were gradually loosing their bright pink coloration. The
mung one was removed and put in with our James's Flamingos for a

period of about a month. After this, on account of it seeming not to be
very happy in its new surroundings, we returned it to the main Caribbean
flock. On its return, the parents, or foster parents as they really were,
showed no further interest and junior fended for itself. After a year its
plumage is bright pink and, if it were not for the fact that its legs are grey
and its hocks black, it would be indistinguishable from the other members
of the flock.
Our Andean Flamingos, of which there are 20, live in a small pen
compared with those of the other flamingos at Slimbridge and are very
close to the public. The only place where we could build their atoll was
within some three or four yards of the main pathway. Here, this year,
they built nine nests and seven birds laid eggs. We were highly excited
as this was the first time that this species had produced eggs in captivity
and we had high hopes of hatching the first Andean Flamingo chick.
But as the termination of the incubation period of each egg occurred
there was no sign of hatching. By this time we had just about given up
hope and decided that the reason for the failure to hatch was that the
birds were pinioned and could not balance themselves for proper copula-
tion, but on examination, five of the eggs were found to be fertile. Then
to our great joy the seventh egg hatched on the 29th day of incubation.
The chick behaved quite differently from the Caribbean Flamingo. It
happened to fall out of the nest on the day it hatched and it crawled back
in, but on the second day it left the nest of its own volition and after a
very short time it did not bother to return except at night. It is now
well grown, its legs are black and the bill shows no sign of yellow as yet
although the wings are quite pink.
Whilst this activity was going on with the Andean Flamingos, our flock
of over 70 Chilean started a major nest-building campaign. Some 50 odd
nests were built and at least 30 eggs laid, from which 10 young birds have
hatched. As in the case of the Andean, some chicks left the nest after
the second day and scarcely ever returned, except to be brooded by the
parent.
The Rosy Flamingos showed two separate nest-building activities and
we are sorry to say that on neither of these occasions did the birds lay.
Whether flamingos lay every year one has not been able to ascertain.
One suggestion for the failure to lay this year has been that the young
should be removed from the flock or the birds will not re-nest the following
year. This, one feels, has yet to be proved.
A difficulty we have experienced is the wintering of the flamingos, in
particular, the Lessers and Caribbean. The weather at Slimbridge is far
too bleak to leave these birds out, so we have developed a building where
they can be housed, and at the same time, where they can be seen during
the winter months by the visiting public. These consist of rectangular
wooden sheds some 50-60 ft. long by 20 ft. wide--one side of which
contains a number of windows, not only to give light to the birds, but also

to allow the public to see them. The houses are built over a water course
so that the water is constantly flowing through the buildings and over the
waterway is a large door through which the flamingos can be walked into an
adjoining pen where, if the weather is sufficiently bright and sunny, they
can spend a little time outside. The water runs close to the window side
of the building and represents about a third of the width. The other
part is a gently sloping concrete surface which is trowelled over and then
painted with a rubberized paint to prevent damage to the feet of the birds.
Infra red lamps and strip lighting are provided.
Considerable trouble has been taken regarding the diet of our birds
and various forms have been tried. Finally, the following meal is made
by milling together equal quantities of wheat, dried shrimp, maize,
poultry biscuit and turkey starter crumbs. To this is added minced
lettuce, carrot and beetroot. The whole is then mixed with water con-
taining Canthaxanthin, Rodophyll and Tylan, into a soup-like consistency.
The soup is fed twice a day.

THE AUSTRALIAN PENGUIN
{Eudyptula minor)

Although penguins are associated with ice floes and the barren wastes
of the Antarctic, some species never see a chunk of ice in their lives and
among these the Australian fairy or little penguin, Eudyptula minor, is an
interesting example.
An attractive bird standing about 18 in. tall, it has dark blue dorsal
plumage and silvery white breast. Like all penguins it is totally flightless,
its wings being modified for paddling and swimming. It walks in an
upright posture and its appearance, antics and general demeanour captivate
anyone who has the good fortune to encounter it.
There is no difficulty in finding this penguin. There are thriving
colonies of the species on Phillip Island, just a short distance from
Melbourne, on most Bass Strait Islands and all along the coasts of Tas-
mania. Others are encountered in different parts of coastal southern
Australia with an occasional straggler reaching Moreton Bay, in south
Queensland.
[ Phillip Island, the Bass Strait islands and Tasmania carry the largest
colonies of this species. In Tasmania, the little penguin appears not to
mind humans at all and may live in the suburbs of Hobart undisturbed.
The well-known Tasmanian ornithologist-author Mr. Michael Sharland
has recorded fairy penguins breeding " under boatsheds along the Hobart
waterfront. It is a noisy bird and often disturbs people living close to
the water ".

The Fairy penguin never goes south and although its movements are
not known, its daily routine has been observed frequently. Usually, the
bird (in parties varying in numbers) spends the day swimming and feeding
on aquatic animals and plants with occasional resting spells on rocks or
sand-bars. On many occasions, during my years in Tasmania, we passed
rocks half-awash in the sea each crowded with a multitude of penguins
taking a rest. There is probably no other bird that can be watched more
easily or at closer quarters. In fact, you can have too much of its some-
times.
During my student days in Tasmania, we would often go to spend the
night at the penguin rookery on Bruny Island, off the east coast of the
island State, an experience that is unforgettable. The best time for
observations is during the breeding season which extends between August
and March but appears to reach its climax around October-November,
depending on the year. The penguin rookery is situated on the isthmus
linking north and south Bruny and consists of several high sand dunes
rising a couple of hundred feet partly covered with tussock grass. On
the western side of the rookery there is a road with a notice that reads
" Penguins cross here, drive carefully ". Beyond the road there is
the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and beyond this the coast of Tasmania. On
the eastern side the dunes slope down to a wide desolate beach and to the
Southern Ocean often bleak and stormy-looking.
Life on the rookery during the day is quiet and peaceful, lulled by the
sounds of the surf and the occasional call of a sea biid. Motor traffic
on the road is rare to say the least. There is not a single penguin to be
seen and you wonder if you are really in a rookery of this species at all.
The penguins are there, right enough. They are in the countless burrows
excavated in the sand, some visible to the naked eye, others concealed by
the tussock grass. At this time of the year, the birds are brooding their
eggs, which are spotless white. A hen penguin may lay one or two or
even three eggs, but there is evidence that one or two form the average,
clutch. The burrow varies in depth from about 2 ft. to 3 ft. with the
entrance hole about 6-7 ins. in diameter.
The penguin can be very pugnacious at all times but more so if disturbed
in the burrow during the incubation period. On many occasions, in
order to inspect the bird and the clutch or the parent and the young,
we would thrust an arm into the burrow, an action which caused the adult
bird to emit a series of calls and hammer the hand savagely with its strong
bill. Because of this we had to protect our hands either with gloves or
with socks padded with grass. The fairy penguin is one of the strongest
little wild creatures I have known. As you hold one in your hands you
cannot help wondering at the toughness and compactness of its body.
It is a solid mass of muscle with a thick coat of fat (between the feather
covering and the skin) which forms an insulating layer. The feathers are

so short and compact that they look as though the bird was covered with a
skin rather than with an ordinary plumage coat.
In conversation with some ornithologists I was told that many fairy
penguins at the Bruny rookery--and in others--appear not to make the
burrows but to appropriate burrows excavated and abandoned by the
short-tailed shearwater or mutton-bird. Pujfinus tenuirostris. This is
possible because the mutton-bird, after breeding in Tasmania, departs on
its fantastic long-distance movement to northern Japan, Alaska and back
to Tasmania again the next breeding season. Thus, if the fairy penguins
become in breeding condition while the mutton-birds are travelling, they
can appropriate empty mutton-bird burrows without finding any opposi-
tion. On several occasions, we found the Bruny rookery containing
brooding penguins occupied the lower burrows while the mutton-birds
occupied the ones closer to the top of the dunes.
One of the most interesting scenes to be seen in Australia is the penguin
parade on Phillip Island when, at dusk, parties of penguins swim ashore
and cross the beaches to the delight of tourists. But few people have
seen the penguin parade at Bruny Island. I am lucky to have. After
dusk, during the breeding season, dozens of penguins that had spent the
day at sea, swam ashore in parties of four or five or a dozen with an
occasional solitary bird. On landing each penguin would stand in the
sand and shake itself vigorously. Hundreds of them lined the beach at
the water mark, their bodies glistening in our spotlights.
The noise they made cannot be described in words. Their calls rose
high above the pounding of the surf and the wind and mingled with the
calls of the birds that had stayed in the burrows. The result was such
a terriffic din, such a fantastic pandemonium, such an extraordinary
intensity of vocal sounds that you seemed to be in a mad world. Nobody
could forget that experience. Calling intermittently, the newly-arrived
penguins would make for the burrows, waddling across the beach, scaling
the sand dunes, pushing their way through tussocks of grass. Some
strayed into our tents from where they had to be shooed away in no
uncertain terms. The function of the sounds, however, was clear enough.
They served for communication so that each newly-arrived bird eventually
reunited with its partner that had been left behind to incubate the eggs.
The two birds would stand side by side in front of the burrow in a typical
" nest-relief ceremony ". They would call softly as though whispering
to each other and bow and touch each other before the two would enter
the burrow. Once the pairs had reunited and retired inside the burrow,
a profound silence fell on the rockery. The sounds of the sea and the
wind were all you could hear.
The silence did not last long though, for around dawn the insane cries
would break the stillness. Leaving its partner in the burrow, a penguin
would now head back for the sea, calling stridently, and it was then when
one of the most amusing scenes in penguinland took place. The penguins

that had emerged from burrows high on the dunes would slide down the
sand slopes on their bellies. It was indeed a quick way of getting down the
dunes and there is no doubt that the fairy penguin is an expert at it.
Some slid down distances of 40 yards or more and fetched up at the foot
of the dunes where they became almost buried in the soft sand. Long
before sunrise, the rookery would be silent again, a contingent of penguins
incubating the eggs in the burrows, the rest swimming in the Southern
Ocean in pursuit of food.
So the cycle went on. And to me the memory of those nights in the
penguin rookery has remained as one of the most gratifying experiences
in my career as a naturalist. Although occasional penguins are shot by
fishermen for crayfish bait, they are wholly protected throughout Australia
and the thriving rookeries on Bass Strait and Tasmania ensure that we
shall have Eudyptula minor with us for many years to come.

THE BIRDS AT CLERES IN 1969
By J. Delacour

The summer of 1969 has been one of the best I can remember, as far
as the weather goes, in Western Europe. But it has not been a good
breeding season for birds. The spring was dull and cold and the number
of clear eggs high. Certain species even did not lay at all, particularly
Waterfowl. I suspect that the exceedingly wet and chilly summer of
1968 is partly to blame for it. Just as a number of plants and shrubs
flowered poorly because they had failed to mature their growth properly
the previous season, birds never got into good breeding condition.
A large number of young birds and animals, however, were reared at
Cleres: five Emus, a dozen Rheas, six Black-necked Swans and many
ducks and geese, including Ringed Teal and another brood of five Black -
Brants. But there were only six Emperor Geese, while none of Red-
breasted or Ross laid at all. By luck, the only hybrid produced was from a
male Black Brant and a female Lesser Whitefront (an almost entirely
black bird). A brood of Ruddy Ducks did not survive, the six chicks
having been carried away by the flow of the running water. We now
have two pairs of Trumpeter Swans, sent by the United States Govern-
ment.
The Tasmanian Water Hens raised 18 young, six under a bantam hen.
All the others were reared in the park by two pairs, which never inter-
fered. Five Brush Turkeys came out of a mound, a number of Peafowls,
including five green, grew up. Many pheasants and a pair of Naked-
faced Currasows (Crax fasciolata) were raised, as well as ten Sonnerats
and a few Ceylonese Junglefowl.

A number of new birds were acquired during the last season: pairs of
West African Ostriches, Two-wattled Cassowaries and Wattled Cranes,
several Hornbills, Victoria and Sclater's Crowned Pigeons, Great Argus,
Ijima Copper Pheasants (a gift from Mr. Ed. Fitzsimmons), White-
headed and Ross Touracous, also a number of small tropical birds for the
new accommodations which have been built during the last summer; a
modern bird gallery in what used to be the drawing-room of the chateau
(50 ft. x 25 ft.), destroyed by fire in 1939. There is a dark passage in the
middle of the room, 9 ft. wide, with ten cages on each side, seen through
windows--16 small compartments (3 ft. x 3 ft. x 5 ft.) and four larger ones
which constitute aviaries. They are all properly heated, ventilated,
decorated and planted. The backs slide up and down, and the cages are
serviced from back corridors. There are no signs of doors or food and
water vessels, which are hidden by rocks, logs and plants and all located
at the back. The hidden tops of the cages and the openings into the
gallery are covered with very thin wire netting, which we prefer to glass.
The collection of small birds in the gallery is varied. There are only
one, two or three birds in each of the smaller cages, while the four flights
can accommodate up to 70. They consist of Hummingbirds, Sunbirds,
Sugarbirds (including Dacni lineata and a Iridophanes pulcherrina),
Mexican Golden-browed Tanagers ( Chlorophonia callophrys ), all the species
of American painted Buntings ( Passerina ), Red-breasted Parrot Finches, a
pair of small Red-headed Barbets ( Eubucco bourcieri ), a Cock of the Rock, a
Blue and White Indian Flycatcher and several Toucanets. The two larger
aviaries contain big Tanagers (Scarlet, Black-throated, Mountain, Red-
rumped and White-winged Blue), Blue and White Kingfishers, Pittas
(Irena's and Large-billed), Bellbirds, Amethyst Starlings, Bulbuls and
Leafbirds, Rosita's Buntings, Black-headed Sugarbirds, Roulrouls,
Silver Chinese Quails, Sand Grouse and a few Waxbills. The two
smaller ones are the home of Calliste Tanagers (10 species), Sugarbirds
and Sunbirds.
Larger aviaries in adjoining halls are inhabited by several species of
Toucans, including the Mountain Blue Andigena laminirostris, Barbets,
Troupials, Weavers, Whydahs and Starlings.
Some of those birds come from the collection of the late Mrs. Milton
Erlanger, as are five Knysna Touracous, all reared in her aviaries at Elberon,
New Jersey, during the past few years. They were presented to me by
her family and they constitute a living memorial to a great bird-lover and
a perfect friend.
We hope to build in 1970 a large tropical garden aviary where exotic
plants and chosen birds will be displayed as they used to be in my green-
house before 1940. But it will be planned to allow the visitors to walk
through. It no doubt will prove to be an outstanding addition to the park.

By Paul Farrant (Trimley St. Mary, Suffolk, England)
My pair of Mitchell's Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematod mitchellii were
housed in an aviary io ft. x 6 ft. x 3 ft. I gave them a nest-box 1 ft.
square, facing S.E., in the bottom of which I put a thick layer of sawdust.
I had obtained the cock bird in August 1968 and in January 1969 I
got him a mate. They were in this outside aviary all the winter. I fed
them on condensed milk and sponge cakes, also fruit. I tried other
things but without success.
I do not know when egg-laying occurred. I had decided to exchange
these two birds, and one morning at the beginning of May I went into
the aviary to catch them for this purpose. Quite by chance I looked into
the nest-box and saw there were two eggs in it, so naturally I decided to
keep them. The hen did not appear to sit on the eggs except at night,
unless it was cold in the day. I think the hot summer helped.
About a month later I saw that one egg had hatched, and the other one
hatched the following day. I searched in various books to find out what
to feed the young on, and decided to stick to the usual diet, but added
maggots. I looked into the nest-box every time I fed the parents,
which was twice a day. The young were very noisy when being fed.
They were fed mostly by the cock bird and soon developed into plump
youngsters covered in greyish down.
One point I found very interesting, the excreta in the nest-box was over
to one corner as though it had been moved there, since the nest had
appeared dirtier on an earlier examination, and the young birds remained
on the clean sawdust the other side.
About two months after they were born (this would be about August)
two heads appeared at the hole in the nest-box. This happened frequently
for about another month and then one bird came out and a few days later
the second one. By this time they were fully feathered and more or less
identical with their parents both in colour and size.
They are now four months old and are flying around with their parents
and feeding themselves on the same diet of condensed milk and sponge
cakes.
When the youngsters first emerged their beaks were black, but they
are now nearly the same colour as those of the parents.
I was very surprised to find these birds much less timid than I had
been led to believe.

By Marvin L. Jones (Oakland, California, U.S.A.)
My visit to Australia took place in mid-June 1969, with very little
forewarning, as my R &amp; R tour from Vietman. I spent six days in the
land " down-under " visiting the zoos in Adelaide, Melbourne and
Sydney, plus the Sir Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary in Healesville. This
article devotes itself only to the bird collections in those parks visited.
Unfortunately there was not sufficient time to visit any of the many
private aviaries or even time to notify these people that I was in the
country, much to my great regret. Hopefully on my next visit I can be
more leisurely and see all of the zoos and many of the excellent private
collections as well.
Birds are of course one of the most cared for parts of any animal collec-
tion in Australia due to the total, complete ban on import of all species
that we would call exotic. This ban has been in effect for almost 20 years,
thus those specimens of Touraco, Birds of Paradise, exotic Cranes,
Macaws, and many others not native to Australia and New Zealand that
I saw, were at least 20 years old. Most were far too old to breed. Some
were in very poor condition with broken toes and drooping wings, but
since each was the last to be seen alive for many years, were cared for like
pieces of gold. The Birds of Paradise in Sydney Zoo for instance are in
many cases establishing new world longevity records, and the male
Ribbon-tail was perhaps the finest I have seen. All came from New
Guinea more than 20 years ago to the private collection of Sir Edward
Hallstrom, who in turn donated them to Taronga Park, Sydney. They
are the last Birds of Paradise alive in Australia.
Because of this total ban, zoos and private fanciers are restricted to the
show of species that are native to Australia, or which were introduced
many years ago and have since become resident, and to New Zealand as
well; species that have reproduced well under captive conditions such as
certain pheasants, finches, weavers and psittacines; the occasional wild
migrant; and of course those still alive that were in zoos at the start of
the ban. It has been reported that one zoo in New Zealand recently
imported a pair of Mute Swans from Europe, however this has not been
substantiated and must not be regarded as a normal experience.
All of the zoos that I visited have large programmes under way to breed
as many foreign or exotic species as possible, and also those native to
Australia. Young from the latter can be used in exchange programmes
with zoos outside of Australia and New Zealand not only as credit for
purchase of exhibitable mammals and reptiles, but as a means of preventing
the large scale smuggling of Australian birds for private fanciers. Hundreds
of individuals of rare species, such as the Golden-shouldered Parrot are
killed each year in the attempts to take them out of the country to dealers

in America and Europe. This species is very rare in Australia, and all
efforts are made by zoos and private fanciers to increase the native
population. However, more common forms in Australia, which are still
rare and expensive overseas are those in general bred in large numbers
by the zoos for export. This leaves the native wild population alone, and
of course actually increases one's knowledge of bird breeding. It would
be wonderful if other zoos, in other lands, used this method to send native
species to zoos, instead of resorting to the capture of wild specimens to
fulfill the needs of collectors. It has placed upon the Australian zoo the
burden of doing its best, and I found that in some zoos the bird curator
has been given greater liberty than in past years. For instance, as many
pens as possible have now been converted to more natural exhibits in
Sydney than previously was the case, resulting in improved hatching
successes.
This of course also has brought not only the zoos closer together (there
is now an Association of Australian and New Zealand Zoo Directors,
formed just six years ago) but has even more importantly joined the
private fancier and the zoo curator into partnerships that has been of great
value, especially in preserving blood lines of exotic gallinaceous birds,
doves and pigeons and psittacines. There remains more to be done with
respect to trading between New Zealand and Australian bird fanciers and
zoos, but a start has been made, brought together by a common need to
maintain stocks as long as possible. As regrettable as such a law is
certainly it has had many beneficial results in bird breeding and husbandry,
so that emphasis has been placed on raising as many forms as possible,
and keeping them alive and healthy as long as possible; actions that zoos
in other lands could well imitate, instead of striving to import as many
species as possible, and breed only those that meet the eye of the interested
curator or fancier. How the wild populations would benefit from such a
more enlightened view!
In describing the collections I will take them alphabetically.

ADELAIDE ZOO, SOUTH AUSTRALIA

<bodyText confidence="0.9990265" page_id="58076048"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
I am going to put myself out on a limb so to speak here, by stating
that the Psittacine collection of this zoo impressed me far more than any
other zoo that I have visited in my life. Every feather on almost every
bird was in just the right place, feet were in good condition, and breeding
is taking place among a great many species. In fact all of the birds at
Adelaide look good. There are about 225 species and forms exhibited,
which is about the same number as at Sydney Zoo, so the collection is
large by Australian standards. The emphasis is on psittacines and
gallinaceous birds, about 70 species of the former and 25 of the latter,
many breeding with success. In the attempt to keep macaws as long as
possible a pair has been induced to breed, which has resulted in a series
of hybrids of just about every colour variety possible. Over a half dozen

hybrids have been reared thus far, admittedly many with vivid oranges,
golds and greens predominating (the parents are the Blue and Yellow
Macaw A. ararauna and Scarlet A. macao). There are both the Red
and Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeets, Barrabands (which in
Australia are called Superbs), Regents and several fine Princess Alexandra's
(again the name locally is simply Princess Parrakeet). It was noted that a
great many parrots and parrakeets are named differently in Australia than
in America and Europe, which no doubt is confusing to many working
in this field. The Rosella collection at Adelaide is complete, with all
species and subspecies exhibited, and most raising young. The Red-
capped or Purple-capped Parrots (P. spurius ) were exceptionally well
coloured here. There were also Barnards, Cloncurry, Twenty-eight and
Port Lincolns Parrakeet5 almost all of the species of Neophemci and
Psephotus ; and of course many cockatoos such as Slender-billed, Rose-
breasted or Galah, Pink or Major Mitchell (never called Leadbeater's in
Australia), Great Palm and all of the other species of Black Cockatoo.
The family of Yellow-tailed was very good looking. In the gallinaceous
birds, which are housed in a series of large runs, I noted perhaps the finest

of the large flightless birds--Ostrich, Emu, Rhea and Cassowary; Little
Blue Penguin; and a fine series of waxbills finches and weavers. Unfor-
tunately many of the aviaries are very old, however, replacements are
being constructed as fast as funding will allow. All zoos in Australia are
finding it difficult to secure money for capital improvements, and for
many there is a need for new and more modern exhibits. Zoos are
; popular in all of Australia, and many now have various education pro-
grammes under way involving the school age children and adults. Again
almost all are now directed by men who have been in the job less than six
; years, men with far more vision than their predecessors and more willing
to co-operate with sister institutions. Here at Adelaide the Director is
; Dr. W. E. Lancaster, a veterinarian who formerly lived for many years
in Malaysia, working in fact with a colleague who now runs the Toronto,
j Canada Zoo (Dr. Norman Scollard). Adelaide of course is well known
for its large mammal collection, however this will not be discussed here.
The zoo unfortunately has rarely been visited by Americans or Europeans

in the zoo field, an oversight that I hope will be rectified in the future,
for it is well worth taking the extra effort to visit.
THE SIR COLIN MACKENZIE SANCTUARY, HEALESVILLE, VICTORIA
Another zoo that has been rarely seen by fellow Americans, but known
due to the work some years ago of a former Director, Dr. Fleay, is this
paradise called the Sir Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary. Actually the fauna
park that is open to the public, in a setting of large gum trees and native
shrubbery, is only part of the 448 acres devoted to the sanctuary, located
about 40 miles from the centre of Melbourne. I was very impressed with
the care taken not only of the animal collection but the botanical preserve.
Much like my colleague, Dr. Grzimek of Frankfurt, I could have spent
days here enjoying the wonderful scenery and observing the fauna.
Many species are of course wild within the vast limits of the sanctuary
(which cannot be visited by the public) and free within the park itself are
over 200 White Ibis (Threskiornis molucca ) and about 100 King Parrots
(Aprosmictus scapularis). The latter especially are beautiful, alighting in
several areas of the park, much like pigeons in the zoos of the United
States, and feeding from the hands of visitors. But the prize of Healesville,
and I might add, its proudest possession, are the Superb Lyrebirds.
The Lyrebird (Menura superba) is the only species of bird that cannot
be exported alive under any circumstances. Under complete protection
it has managed to increase in numbers and in fact wild birds may be found
not too many miles from the fauna park. It is however very nervous and
secretive, and wild birds are rarely seen by human observers. Within the
fauna park there is a huge cage, several hundred feet long, replete with
dense vegetation and only a narrow twisting path for visitors (and then
open to the public only for a few hours in the afternoon), for just one
pair of birds. It was my great thrill and pleasure to be allowed by the
Director, Mr. Vernon Mullet, to see the male Lyrebird in his mating
dance. Just a few minutes after I came to the park, about ten in the
morning, he started to call, and what a piercing call it is. The Lyrebird
is a mimic, and a superb one at that, but the range is high and one could
hear it all over the park. We entered the cage, and moving about quietly
and softly came upon him at the start of his dance. Fortunately I was
able to get a few pictures of this, despite the darkness of the cage, and
the denseness of the planting. The dance lasted about 15 minutes and
all the while he would call. Certainly a sight that I will long remember,
and one seen by few Americans. Nothing can quite describe the beauty
and the gracefulness of this performance, the long tail feathers moving
like so much rustling silk, so unlike the feathers of any other bird. The
sanctuary has been able to hatch one bird thus far, and a new aviary is
planned for it. In fact two large new aviaries were under construction
for the expanding Brush Turkey collection, the aim being to breed as
many as possible and to keep them for further study. Most of the
aviaries, except for a few small parrakeets, are set in the landscape and

one comes upon them rather unexpectedly. There is a fine walk-through
aviary for native waterfowl and shorebirds. Nearby is a large man-made
lake, holding many millions of gallons of water, on which many rare
Australian waterfowl will be kept. On my visit I managed to see my
first ever living Musk Duck (Biziura lobata ), and also of note were a dozen
Eyton Tree Duck. Other birds in the collection were several Brolga or
Australian Cranes (which also have been bred here); Fairy Penguins;
seven Wedge-tailed Eagles living in a very large and quite unusual cage
that was rectangular in shape, and merely was netting hung on large
telephone poles, placed at outward angles. The cage was large enough
for the birds to fly about, and in it were many living trees. I also saw
several Satin Bowerbird; 12 Chestnut-breasted Teal; nine Cape Barren
Geese; over a dozen Royal Spoonbill; four Gang Gang Cockatoo; about

mammals here such as Platypus (which also lives wild even within the
great fauna park) and native reptiles. The overall theme of course is
species native to Australia and Tasmania. Like the larger zoos it charges
admission. While in some lands it might not be called a zoo, it is recog-
nized by the federal Australian Government as one of the six class A zoos
in the nation.

MELBOURNE ZOO, VICTORIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999430545454545" page_id="58076051"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
Well known to many American and European zoo men due to the fact
that it carries on a large animal exchange programme, Melbourne is
again an old zoo, struggling to build new quarters and expand its collection,
despite strict import regulations. Unlike some of its sister institutions,
however, it has secured funds necessary for a ten-year programme of
construction, already evident in the largest in-zoo Lion Park anywhere in
the world, a new Reptile House and new exhibits for large mammals.
The zoo has a long series of aviaries which are used exclusively for the
raising of native Australian species for export and for fanciers. I would
say there are about 80 pens, all are relatively new, adequate and successful.
Breeding probably is carried on more than at Adelaide, although there
does not appear to be quite as full a range of species. I would say
about 40 species of psittacines. There are large flight cages, perhaps
larger than any in Europe or North America for terns, gulls, cormorants,
waterfowl, and birds of prey. In addition there are dozens of conventional
cages, and of course some in need of replacement. All are kept clean
and the birds look well. Of course many forms that we would consider
exotic here in America, are common in the areas right outside Melbourne,
such as cockatoos, so one finds all too often cages that are literally crammed
with birds. I counted at least 100 Sulphur-crested Cockatoos and then
gave up. There were several dozen Pennant Parrakeets, which again are
native to this part of Australia. Melbourne is especially successful in the

raising of Cape Barren or Cereopsis Geese, over 20 hatched in 1968 alone,
and I counted no less than 16 birds in various parts of the zoo. I also
noted a new race of Skua for me, S. skua lonnbeygi , the Southern Skua 5
one Australian Pelican (this species is rarer in Australian zoos than in
Europe or America); a pair of Indian Adjutant Storks that have been in
the zoo for 40 years, but which only last year started to make a nest, after
being moved to a new cage--their first next-building attempt in the zoo
(extraordinary!); many Philippine Land Rails; Nankeen Night Herons
(which are also wild in the zoo and raise many young each year); about
17 Eyton Tree Duck; five Semipalmated Geese; a pair of Sarus Crane;
Whistling Eagles ( H. sphenurus)\ Gang Gang Cockatoos, and again both
of the New Zealand Parrakeets. The collection is good, well cared for,
and well worth seeing.
TARONGA PARK ZOO, SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES
This is of course the zoo best known outside of Australia, although its
specific collection may not be. It is the largest overall zoological garden,
both in land area and in terms of size of the animal collection. There
are about the same number of bird species as Adelaide, however, the
variety is somewhat different. It is the last zoo with Birds of Paradise,
all having come from the collection of Sir Edward Hallstrom, who no
longer has a collection at Mona Vale. Unfortunately, as is well known,
Sir Edward has a passion it seems for concrete, and almost all of the
aviaries were floored with tons of concrete and in fact many cages are of
this material alone, save for the wire. In recent years much of this has
been torn up, and an effort made to make the aviaries as natural looking as
possible. Emphasis has been shifted also to hatching and breeding as
many species as possible. The bird keeper here is a gifted man and is
doing a wonderful job. The zoo also is the recipient of many birds that
have been taken from airplanes and ships in the smuggling process, too
many do not survive being placed in tight airless quarters, but of those
that do make it, the zoo does its best to house them properly. It was
here that I saw some of the unique devices used to try and smuggle
Golden-shouldered Parrots out of Australia, really just cages inside
attache cases, with little air, and no room to move. But with fanciers and
zoos in Europe and American willing to pay several thousand dollars a
pair, the traffic goes on. I would like to add here, that collectors should
insist on knowing the origin of all birds of this rare species bought from
exotic animal dealers, and not traffic in illegal birds. For it is the birds
that are suffering.
What of the collection at Taronga Park? Well it is growing in many
areas, in fact in some species hatching has been so successful that birds
are being offered to foreign zoos as well as to collections within the nation.
Many however, are very rare, and care is being taken to keep them alive
and healthy as long as possible. Here are the highlights of the Taronga
collection of birds: six Australian Cassowary (and three other cassowary

Allen Silver died in Llantarnam, on 4th January, 1970, in his 91st year.
Born at Long Melford, Suffolk in 1879, he had the inborn interests of
a countryman. Very early his leanings veered largely in the direction of
British passerine birds and although he specialized in passerines and
picarenes he was, nevertheless, keenly interested in all birds, whether
ornamental pheasants, waterfowl, show or utility poultry or pigeons; in
addition, he took no little interest in mammals, fish and insects. At one
time or another he owned examples of the majority of European cage-birds
and a very large proportion of the imported exotic species, varying from
sunbirds to macaws.
As far back as 1895 he was appointed a judge of cage-birds and from
then until very recent times he officiated at shows throughout the country.
He judged at many Crystal Palace Shows, both before and after the first
World War, and the National was not, of course, complete without his
presence.
In his time he was a very prominent exhibitor, staging as many as sixty
birds at a single show. In the late 1920s he won all the principal
Budgerigar trophies, several outright.
He was elected a Member of the Foreign Bird Club in 1903, and of the
Avicultural Society in 1904, of which he was doyen and Vice-President
since 1958. With several others he founded the Budgerigar Club, of
which he was Chairman for the first three years, also Editor of the
Budgerigar Bulletin for the same period. Long before this he was closely
connected with the National British Bird Club, the London Cage Bird and
London Provincial Ornithological Societies, and in 1911 he resuscitated
the Foreign Bird Exhibitors' League.
Allen Silver contributed only infrequently to the Magazine but his
writings were many and varied. He revised Bradburn's Book of British
Birds; compiled The Birdkeepers ' Guide; wrote British Bird Management ,
The Parrot Book and the bird section of The Wonder Book of Pets. He
was on the staff of Canary and Cage Bird Life during its existence, British
and foreign bird expert to The Feathered World , and, of course, foreign
bird expert to Cage and Aviary Birds.
Despite the incredible hardship of losing a leg in the 1914-1918 War,
Allen Silver was ever cheerful and always so willing and helpful. A
natural gentleman and a great bird-lover his passing leaves another
unfillable gap. A. A. P.

The Royal Zoological Society of South Australia reports that during
the 1968-69 season 134 birds of 37 species and varieties were bred in the
Adelaide Zoological Gardens. The outstanding event was the breeding
of three Banded Landrails Hypotaenidia philippensis , a probable " first "
in the Gardens. For the fifth year running a Blue and Yellow x Scarlet
Macaw hybrid was reared. A Leadbeater's Cockatoo was reared, the
first in 15 years, also six Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets. The Rosellas
did particularly well, six of the ten species in the Collection--Yellow,
Northern, Western, Eastern, Golden-mantled and Pale-headed--reared
16 young between them.
The Brush-Turkeys Alectura lathami again did well, 24 young hatched
from the mound and only three failed to survive.

Hartley King: " We have had a very dry winter here in Western
Australia, and there is little prospect of much rain during the forthcoming
summer. The effect of this is very noticeable in the breeding habits of
our wild birds and wildlife generally.
The marsupials are withholding their young; the waterfowl have had
such a poor season that duck shooting is to be prohibited; our parrots
that would normally have young on the wing have not gone to nest yet,
and so on.
Most of the farmers' dams are dry, and water restriction will be *
inevitable before Christmas.
This trend is reflected in our aviary birds, but not by any means to the
same extent. My pair of Banded Plovers have already raised three
young and are nesting again. (Last year--from June to June--they
raised six lots of chicks.)
My Neophemas have made a good start; Scarlets, Turquoisines and

A world record auction price for a printed book of #90,000 was paid
at Sotheby's on 24th November 1969 for a copy of Audubon's " The
Birds of America Sold anonymously it was bought by Mr. Kenneth
Nebenzahl, a Chicago bookseller. The almost unbelievable price is
accounted for by the fact that this very rare work is a superb copy ' in
the finest possible condition ".
John James Laforest Audubon (1785-1851) was the illegitimate son of a
Creole and a French naval officer, who adopted him and took him to
France, where he studied painting and developed a love for natural history.
North America became his home but due to his passion for bird painting
various business ventures did not thrive and he was forced to support his
family by painting portraits. Returning to Europe in 1821, successful
exhibitions in Liverpool and Edinburgh encouraged him to issue a
prospectus of a work that was to ensure him a place amongst America's
immortals.
" The Birds of America " was issued without text (which followed in
^31-39 under the title "Ornithological Biography") during 1827-38,
in 87 parts of five plates each. It was published at two guineas the part,
or #182 14s. o d. the set ($1,000 in the U.S.A.). The 435 copper-plate
engravings, coloured by hand, contain 1,065 life-size figures of 489
supposedly distinct species. It is believed that fewer than 200 complete
sets, usually four volumes, were bound up.

In a review of " Henry Walter Bates ", by George Woodcock, in
The Geographical Journal , September 1969, 456-7, Dr. Edward Hindle
refers to a plate in The Naturalist on the River Amazons , by H. W. Bates,
showing the author being mobbed by toucans. It may not perhaps be
without interest to recount Bates' account published in 1863, of the
affair with the Curl-crested Toucan Pteroglossus beauharnaisii. He
writes: " I had an amusing adventure one day with these birds. I had
shot one from a rather high tree in a dark glen in the forest, and entered
the thicket where the bird had fallen, to secure my booty. It was only
wounded, and on my attempting to seize it, set up a loud scream. In an
instant, as if by magic, the shady nook seemed alive with these birds,
although there was certainly none visible when I entered the jungle.
They descended towards me, hopping from bough to bough, some of
them swinging on the loops and cables of woody lianas, and all croaking
and fluttering their wings like so many furies. If I had had a long stick
in my hand I could have knocked several of them over. After killing
the wounded one I began to prepare for obtaining more specimens and
punishing the viragos for their boldness; but the screaming of their
companion having ceased they remounted the trees, and before I could
reload, every one of them had disappeared."

THE ADVENTURES OF AN ESCAPED RED-BILLED BLUE MAGPIE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998589266666667" page_id="58076058"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
Last June the cock of a pair of Red-billed Blue Magpies escaped. This I
discovered when it appeared suddenly on a fence, bowled a grey squirrel head-over-
heels, stole a nut it was eating, and disappeared into the blue. Normally I get
innumerable reports when one of my birds escape but strangely enough I heard
nothing of this bird until mid-November when I received a telephone call asking
if I could identify a strange bird which had been resident in a strip of woodland
in Riddlesdown since last June, and which regularly visited four or five gardens
backing onto the wood. Apparently a report had appeared in the local press
two weeks previously, but I had missed it. From the description I was pretty
sure it was my magpie, so on the following Sunday I took the hen, in a large
parrot cage, and a trap cage, up to one of the gardens it was said to visit daily;
arriving at 8 a.m. when it was still only just getting light.
As I was hoisting the cage onto a shed roof I heard the bird " chuckle " some
distance off, and the hen promptly replied. The trap cage, baited with mice, I
put on top of the parrot cage, and retired to a garage with a convenient window
overlooking the garden. Within five minutes the cock was on the shed roof,
rushing round and round the cage, displaying just like a golden pheasant, with
tail spread, wing trailing and body twisted towards the hen. Twice he fell off the
roof in his excitement, once he caught the tip of the hen's tail through the wire
and nearly pulled it out. Then he sat still for about five minutes, apparently to
recover his breath before again circling the cage, and at last jumped up on top,
onto the trap, where he spotted the mice and without hesitation dived in. The
lid came down with a smack but he never even glanced up, just grabbed a mouse
and commenced eating. By 9 a.m. he was back in his aviary, both he and the
hen having eaten five mice between them on my journey home.
The next day he sulked, but the day after was completely rehabilitated and
seemed tamer than he was prior to his escape. He was in perfect condition,
having evidently moulted during his freedom, his bill and legs being now deep
orange (they had faded to dull yellow in the aviary), and strangely, one central
tail feather which had always been slightly faulty was now pure white.

VITAMINS AND FRENCH MOULT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998583722222222" page_id="58076058"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
So much has been written on feather malformation generally, and French Moult
in budgerigars in particular, that I hesitate to take up more space on this subject.
It is, however, an important matter, especially to the afflicted birds, in whose
interest I feel prompted to write.
One of the main factors making birds aware of the advent of the breeding
season is the production in their bodies of vitamin D by the action of the ultra-
violet rays in sunlight on a substance called ergosterol in the body. This oil-
soluble vitamin is popularly called the sunshine vitamin. Most budgerigar breeders
start the season early, in the short winter days when little ultra-violet light penetrates
our atmosphere, and they therefore add vitamin D to the diet, usually in the form
of cod-liver-oil added to the seed. However, Vitamin D is not something of
which it may be said that if a little is good a lot will be better. Too much is harmful
to human beings, causing excess calcium and phosphorus retention and a rough
skin condition. T. here is, of course, no harm done in feeding the small amount
of cod-liver-oil recommended by the makers to bring the birds into condition, but
it must be remembered that what is the correct amount in the short winter days
can be excessive when the birds are producing their own vitamin D in spring and
summer conditions.

I believe that the supply of vitamin D by oil-soaked seed should stop well
before the young are due to hatch, as apart from the vitamin being cumulative in
the body, in the wild state the young of virtually all parrot-type birds do not
emerge from a dark nest-hole until fully feathered, and clearly will receive only the
very small amount of vitamin D provided naturally by the parents during the
feather-forming period.
No theory can be proved without a number of controlled tests (which I
unfortunately do not have the opportunity to carry out), but in support I can
quote from my own experience some years ago when breeding from four or five
pairs of budgerigars. The birds were kept outside and the first early round with
cod-liver-oil and artificial light to lengthen the feeding hours was quite successful.
Cod-liver-oil was continued throughout the season, and all subsequent young
with the exception of two albinos had malformed feathers to a greater or lesser extent,
many being cases of French Moult at its worst.
It would be wrong to suggest that only budgerigars can be fitted into this theory,
but they are the species most prone to French Moult and they do feed their young
on a regurgitated paste derived from the seed provided. I would also, in con
elusion, like to quote from an excellent little book which I read recently " Halfmoon
and Dwarf Parrots " in which the author, William Allan, advises strongly against
keeping a caged bird by a window. Apart from the draught possibilities he writes
(in Dallas, Texas, where the sun is the large de luxe model) that the sunlight
causes the bird to undergo a continuous moult.
I find the connection between excessive vitamin D and feather abnormalities
inescapable, but it would require a lot of feeding trials to prove it.

Like many members, I am sure, the correspondence about foreign birds being
released in the countryside--whether by accident, intention, or " controlled
liberty "--has been of great interest to me. I am certain that the participants in
the debate have all seen the current issue of Ibis, but for members who have not
it may be of interest to make note of a letter from R. O. Vicente in Portugal. The
letter is headed "A new introduced species in Europe: the Red-eared waxbill
The substance of the letter is that Estrilda troglodytes has been observed living
and breeding in the wild in Portugal on several occasions during the past five years.
Flocks of up to 300 have been observed, and both nests and juvenile birds have
been seen on various occasions. The purpose of Mr. Vicente's letter was to ask
for any ornithologists holidaying in Portugal to keep an eye open for the species
and report it.
Having newly arrived in Madrid where I expect to live for the next couple of
years, the letter is of extra interest to me. This is not the point though. The
existence of ringed individuals in the flocks shows that they are almost certainly
from an avicultural source, so the culprits are known though their motives are
not. It remains to be seen how well the Red-earned waxbill establishes itself in
I Portugal; if holidaying bird watchers do oblige Mr. Vicente, and the species can
be shown to have claimed an ecological niche in competition with local avifauna
then the contributors to the debate will surely be nearer a conclusion.

LONGEVITY IN PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9229713" page_id="58076060"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
I am writing in response to your request in the September--October issue of
The Avicultural Magazine for information on cases of longevity in parrots.
On 12th May i960, I obtained from Mrs. Dale Ellenberger of this city the body
of a male Amazona aestiva aestiva (the Brazilian race of the Blue- or Turquoise-
fronted Amazon). This bird had been in the continuous possession of Mrs.
Ellenberger's family, and I was told that it had been purchased in Rio de Janeiro
approximately 70 years before its death; the family did not have the exact year,
but according to family tradition, the bird was about 75 years old at its death.
The bird was in excellent condition, with moderately enlarged gonads, and was
just completing a moult. I made no attempt at autopsy; in view of the known
great age of this bird, I thought its body might conceivably be of interest to some
researcher, so I prepared a study skin (Carnegie Mus. no. 139,369) and preserved
the remainder of the carcass in spirits (C.M. alcoholic collection no. 844).
I hope this information is of interest to you.

Concerning the note in The Avicultural Magazine about longevity in parrots,
I wonder whether the following may be of some interest. A good many years ago,
while I was at the London Zoo, I was called upon to go to the house of a Harley
Street specialist--actually to remove a closed ring from the leg of a canary, which
had become embedded in the flesh and which, incidentally, was successfully
accomplished without any harm resulting. In conversation afterwards, the
gentleman showed me an African Grey Parrot which was in a large cage in a front
room overlooking Harley Street and told me that to his undoubted knowledge,
it had stood there for the last 60 years. As it was in excellent condition, there
could have been no reason to suppose that it might not continue to stand there
for many years afterwards. Judging between this species and the common species
of Amazons usually kept, it does seem in my experience that the former often
excels in longevity, as I, when Overseer of birds, received many queries by phone
and otherwise, concerning Amazons which through weakness apparently due to
age, were unable to perch after reaching an age of from 30 to a maximum of 40
years to their owners knowledge; although, of course, there may be many exceptions.
Cockatoos, as everyone knows, are very long-lived but one does not hear so much
about Macaws, perhaps because they are not so easy to house for the ordinary
person.

The Planning Authorities have approved the use of 10 acres of land for Bird
Gardens, Pleasure Gardens, etc. It is surrounded by woodland and it is adjacent
to a delightful Manor House (occupied by owner). There is adequate space for
parking and its situation is close to four main towns, convenient for the M.i and
A.5. It is believed that this could be developed into a very lucrative " Bird and
Pleasure Gardens ", etc. It is proposed to form a syndicate for the development of
the site. At the present moment someone with the complete " know-how " about
birds, preferably with some capital, is required. In the first place please write to:
F. H. Charnley, Links Cottage, East Common, Harpenden, Hertfordshire.

THE ELEGANT BUNTING
(Emberiza elegans)
By Robin L. Restall (Madrid, Spain)

I
Some years ago I noticed an advertisement by Mr. C. Hill of Pinner in
Middlesex for " Unidentified male Siberian buntings, five only, looks
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9871890625" page_id="58076083"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
like Shore Lark ". Nobody could blame Mr. Hill for not being able to
identify the species, for a friend of mine who is a professional ornithologist
and whom I regard as an expert, was unable to identify it on sight. Sub-
sequent investigation on his part identified it as the Elegant Bunting
Emberiza elegans. I contacted Mr. Hill and discovered that he only had
one bird left, but I was fortunate to be able to obtain it. Mr. Hill was
very helpful and told me all he knew about the bird, including what he
was feeding it on, and we arranged for a mutually convenient transport
date.
Eventually the bird arrived. I was looking forward to seeing it very
much for of all the reference books I have the only one to mention the
species was Aviculture , which said of it: " Said to be a favourite cage-bird
of the Japanese on account of its song and doubtless, also, of its charming
colouring (then followed a description). . . . This pretty bird breeds at
Ichang and Sechuen, is probably resident in Japan, visits Manchuria and
the valley or Amur in summer, and is a common winter visitor of China,
where it frequents the hillsides, bamboo clumps, and rough scrub around
farm clearings; its nesting-habits are probably similar to those of other
species of the genus ".
More recently I have referred to the books by La Touche (1925),
Seebohm (1890) and the Caldwells (1931) to pull together notes on
distribution, local habitat and description of the races. I have not had
the opportunity of examining skins of the species, but have learned of the
areas from which those in the collection at the British Museum (Natural
History) have come, and these have been borne in mind. Yamashina's
book on the birds of Japan only gives the barest reference, so I have not
used it. Mr. Allen Silver very kindly wrote to me on the subject as
follows " . . . the Zoo had it previous to 1929 but have no account of it
since. Taka Tsukasa in Aviculture in Japan (see page 36) mentions it as
being kept among other buntings there. . . . These several buntings are
kept for their song, which like the quails kept in the past for their call, are
repetitious rather than musical to our ears ".

The English names for the species are confusing, but Yellow-browed
and Yellow-throated Bunting are the commonest. I have chosen to call
it the Elegant Bunting, the name used by Mr. Silver, but one which he
thought particularly inappropriate. Personally, I find this bird extremely
attractive and elegant, and, in fact, one of the most appealing of.all
buntings I have kept (Emberiza or Passerina).
As it is virtually unknown in this country I will describe it in some
detail. The adult male is about 6 in. long. Its forehead and crown,
sides of head, chin and a large crescent-shaped patch across the breast
are all black. The superciliary (eyebrow) and sides of the neck, back of
the crown and throat are bright yellow. The nape is black, while the lower
hind neck is grey, marked with black and chestnut. The feathers of the
crown are elongated into a half crest which can be erected at will. When
fully depressed, the yellow crescent immediately behind the crest is
covered by it. In winter the black head feathers are edged with brown
and the feathers of the hind neck are more noticeably streaked.
The back is chestnut, the rump is grey, and the upper tail coverts and
tail are greyish brown. The outer edges of the outer tail feathers are
white. The wings are mainly black, with pale chestnut edges. The tips
of the median and greater wing coverts are very pale buff, nearly white,
forming two broad wing bars. The innermost secondaries are black,
broadly edged with brown, while the secondaries and primaries are dark
brown edged with brown. Below, the bird is white, tinged with rufous
on the flanks which are also streaked with long chestnut stripes.
As the winter proceeds the brownish edges to the feathers of the head
and neck wear away and the bird looks sharply and more strongly
pencilled above.
The adult female is similar to the male, but differs in the following
respects: the black of the head in the male is brown in the female, the yellow
of the head is duller and less extensive, and only a tinge on the throat.
The breast crescent is reduced to vestigial traces, and in some individuals
is missing altogether. In the winter plumage the throat and upper parts
are more infused with brown or buff.
The edges to the feathers being broader the back looks browner. In
both sexes the iris is brown, the legs are flesh, and the bill is black in
summer and brown in winter, with paler lower mandible. Immature
birds resemble adult females but are possibly browner on the throat and
head.
It is a bird of great character, imparted largely by the head charac-
teristics--the strong bandit's mask and the stylish crest which is raised
and depressed at will. The only illustration I have found is a photo-
graph of a male on the nest (Hanzak, 1967), but Mr. Silver's encyclopaedic
knowledge wrote: " . . . there is a figure of it in Jap. Aves, 1850, pi. 55,
by Temminck and Schlegel. The one I possess is that in Birds of Japan,
by Ksisuke Kobavashi, illustrated by Takashi Mivamato on plate 6

Races and Distribution
Professor Sushkin defined three races which are briefly as follows:
</category>
<bodyText confidence="0.979736829268293" page_id="58076086"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
Emberiza elegans elegans (Temm.), which has been referred to elsewhere
as Temminck's Yellow-browed Bunting. It is distinguished by having
strongly streaked flanks, black on chestnut. This is the northern race,
an uncommon resident in Japan and Manchuria, breeding in Amurskaya
(Amur or Amoor in the literature) and probably resident in Korea. It
winters in China wandering as far south as the Yangtse Kiang.
E. e. sibirica (Sushkin), sometimes called Sushkin's Yellow-throated
Bunting is the Chinese race, ranging from Kiangsu southwards to Kwang-
tung (Hong Kong, to assist the reader in his geography). It is the least
strongly marked, being greyer on the nape and having the flanks scantily
marked with narrow streaks. It is the race in my plate.
E. e. elegantula (Swinhoe) is browner and darker above than either of
the others, and the flank stripes are very broad. It is the mountain race
ranging from Manchuria down to N.W. Fukien. It, too, breeds in the
northern parts and winters in the south.
Habitat and Habits
According to Hanzak its favourite haunts are young oak woods, but
the Caldwells are more helpful, saying it is found working on grassy
plots under certain hardwood trees, scratching under the leaves for buried
seeds. They say it is friendly and confiding being found usually in loose
colonies which permit a close approach for observation and study. All
that La Touche has to say on the subject is that it winters in south-eastern
Manchuria in sheltered woods and valleys, and Butler's comments are
mentioned earlier above.
Unfortunately my bird had a broken wing, and so its behaviour could
hardly be termed normal. However, it was in excellent physical con-
dition and certainly seemed full of bounce and energy. It was placed in a
roomy outdoor aviary (house n ft. x 9 ft., flight 11 ft. x 17 ft.) which is *
planted with Cupressus, Finns and various other shrubs, including some
ground St. John's Wort ( Hypericum calycinum ) and a standard privet.
The bunting shared this enclosure with a pair of Rustic Buntings, Cali-
fornia Quail, Mesias and a few other medium-sized birds. It settled in
immediately, and soon established two favourite spots, the first under a
small Lonicera nitida where it was perfectly hidden and from where it
could sally forth on food hunting forays. The second was in the heart of a
Cupressus where it roosted along with a few other birds. Naturally,
I suppose, it spent more time in company with the Rustic Buntings
(E. rustica) than any of the other species present. On many occasions, it
could be seen working over the grass looking for insects and other items,
the three birds forming a loose group. I never saw it doing this alone,
although it foraged through the undergrowth by itself (perhaps I should

explain that the aviary is divided longitudinally, the front half being
" lawn " and the rear being shrubbery).
I put it outside at the end of the autumn, 1967, and there it stayed until
mid-March when it was given to Mr. Yealland at the Zoo. I always
throw a handful of mealworms around the aviary at feeding time, as this
prompts rather more natural behaviour than simply using pots on a shelf.
On several occasions, the bunting would dash out from beneath the
Lonicera and seize one, mumble it in its beak for a minute, and then run
back under cover. It never seemed to show the slightest sign of aggres-
sion, although this could be explained by the fact that its injury must have
kept it below peak condition. It never sang either. The Pekins are said
to prize it as a songster (La Touche), and it is kept as a cage bird for this
reason. What its song is really like I cannot say, but there is no doubt
that Oriental ears like different sounds or qualities to western ones, and
several species that are kept as cage birds for their song could hardly
qualify in the west.
The crest is completely inconspicuous when depressed and runs down
into a black crescent on the nape; mostly, however, it is very slightly
raised giving an impression of slightly elongated feathers. Frequently
it is raised to the extent shown in my picture, and higher. Mr. Hill
made the following comment in a letter to me about them: " . . . have
noticed they raise their crest when aggressive and trill like a waxwing, but
their alarm note is just like a Yellowhammer's It seemed to me that
the crest was raised whenever the bird was excited, be it alarm, curiosity
or what.

Food
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9954759375" page_id="58076087"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
The natural food must be described as various small seeds and insects,
the callow young being fed entirely on insect life, which is predictable
and not very helpful. Most avicultural text books suggest " canary seed,
millets, oats and hemp " for buntings en masse , but the bill of the elegant
is fine and light and seems inadequate to deal with dry hemp and oats.
Mr. Silver kindly gave me a reference for an article in the Avicultural
Magazine (3rd series, Volume XIII, 1922) by Taka Tsukasa which
apparently describes how the Japanese feed their buntings on soft food.
Unfortunately, I do not have this so cannot give details here. My
Elegant Bunting had access to canary mixture, mixed millets, Haith's
English Weed seeds mixture, and Sluis Universal grade Softfood. The
latter was placed in a bowl on the floor and was only taken in small
quantities; of the former it is impossible to say what was taken or what
the preferences were. Mealworms and maggots were both taken eagerly.
Mr. Hill told me that he had kept them on plain canary, mixed millets,
maggots, mealworms and softbill food.

Nesting
Although there are large gaps in my study of the literature, it seems as
though the species has not been bred in captivity, at least in Britain. It is
a ground nester, and so would not require any special pans or receptacles,
but clearly would require suitable cover. The nest is built of soft bents,
fine stems, etc., and is always on the ground beneath an overhanging
stone, fallen log, over-arching root, etc., amongst bracken, brushwood,
or other tangled undergrowth, or Skylark-fashion, beneath a clump of
grass. The clutch is normally four or five and they are dirty white with
pale violet markings and dark brown spots. According to Hanzak they
are double brooded.
Summary
To the contemporary aviculturist, this is an unknown species and there
is virtually no mention of it in the available literature It is a lovely
member of the Emberiza genus and would, no doubt, repay study, although
it would appear to be fairly typical in most respects. It is hoped that
these notes will prompt any other members who have experience of the
species to contribute to the common wealth.

By J. R. Hodges (Pinner, Middlesex, England)
There can be no more satisfying branch of aviculture than that devoted
to the establishment of aviary bred strains of various species. Several
members of the Avicultural Society have succeeded in breeding many
species to several successive generations but unfortunately their experi-
ences (except those of Nicholson with Red Headed Parrot Finches and
Teague with Gouldian Finches) have seldom been documented. The
almost complete ban on the export of native fauna imposed by the
Australian authorities has provided a great incentive to establish aviary
strains of the many attractive Australian species. Fortunately, most
Australian Parrakeets and Finches do well in captivity and can be induced
to breed. Australian parrakeets make ideal aviary inhabitants and to me
the most desirable of them are the Grass Parrakeets. The members of
this genus (Neophema) have every conceivable advantage from the avi-
cultural point of view. They are extremely beautiful, they often become
tame and confiding, they are hardy and they are not difficult to maintain
and breed. Two further advantages which they possess of particular
interest to those of us who are compelled to live in towns and suburbs are
that they require only small aviaries and are not noisy. They are not as
widely kept as they deserve to be and I have often wondered whether their
comparative lack of popularity is due to the pessimistic accounts which
the avicultural writers of the 1930's gave of the ease with which they were
supposed to die from all sorts of diseases with almost meaningless names
like contagious conjunctivitis and septicaemia. Many of these authors
were repeating the gloomy prognostications of the late Duke of Bedford
whose lack of success with the Grass Parrakeets was probably due to the
fact that he kept them in unsuitably large aviaries in which they were
inclined to panic and dash headlong against the wire netting with fatal
results. In any case, he was often inclined to make sweeping generaliza-
tions about a particular species or genus on the basis of a limited experience
with only a few specimens.
Since 1956, I have kept several pairs of six of the seven species of the
genus. Last year I saw for the first time the other (the Orange Bellied)
in one British aviary and in several South Australian aviaries. The
Splendid (TV. splendida) is probably the favourite of most Grass Parrakeet
enthusiasts but, attractive as it is, I do not think it can compare with the
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet ( N . chrysostoma ). My first pair of Blue-
wings were obtained more than 10 years ago. At first they lived up to
their reputation of being difficult to persuade to breed, but gradually
they began to produce a few youngsters and I was able to build up a small
stock. In 1964 I obtained a few imported Australian aviary bred

specimens and although for a while the breeding results continued to be
disappointing, they gradually improved and during 1967, 1968 and 1969
three or four breeding pairs have produced more than 20 youngsters per
year. Breeding pairs have been made up only from the best unrelated
youngsters and, as a result, I have been able to develop a breeding strain
of prolific, large, well-coloured specimens.
The natural habitat of the Blue-wing is Tasmania and coastal areas of
Victoria and South Australia. It is reputed to be the most common
parrot in Tasmania and, for this reason, I was very disappointed at not
seeing any in the wild during a very brief visit to Hobart and its lovely
surrounding countryside in October 1969. However, I was compensated
for the dearth of Blue-wings in the places I visited by the sight of large
numbers of Tasmanian or Green Rosellas (Platycercus caledonicus) many
of which came to feed on the ground within a few yards of where I stood
at Port Arthur. Many Blue-wings migrate from their breeding grounds
in Tasmania to Victoria and South Australia when the weather con-
ditions become less favourable and the food supplies scarce. Melbourne
aviculturists often find large numbers of Blue-wings around their aviaries
at certain times of the year. These are birds on their migratory passage
which are attracted by the calls of the aviary inmates.
Several of the Australian aviculturists I visited lecently keep Blue-
winged Parrakeets which, even in their native habitat, have the reputation
of not being very free breeders in captivity. However, at the Melbourne
Zoo, which possesses one particularly attractive exhibit in the form of an
extremely well designed range of breeding aviaries for rare parrakeets, the
species appears to flourish and one compartment of the range contained
at the time of my visit 30 to 40 Blue-wings, all apparently bred at the
Zoo.
The Blue-winged is one of the largest of the Grass Parrakeets and is
about eight and a half inches long. The adult male is olive green on the
back, pale green on the throat and chest and yellow on the abdomen and
the underside of the tail. The wings are deep royal blue as also is the
frontal band and the dorsal side of the tail. The lores and the areas
around the eyes are bright yellow. The primaries are black, the bill is
almost black and the legs are grey. The female is said to differ from the
male in being duller coloured generally. However, individual specimens
vary considerably in brightness of colour and the only reliable guide to
sex in adults is the jet black of the primaries of the male which contrasts
with the brownish black of the female. One of the most attractive
features of the Blue-wing is the large round button-like eves which give it a
very bright and intelligent look. It is easy to confuse immature specimens
with young Elegant Parrakeets (M. elegans) but in the adults the differences
are very noticeable. Elegants are distinctly more slender, the green
plumage has a more golden yellow hue and the frontal band extends
behind the eye. The Blue-wing is more olive green and the frontal band is

less extensive. However, the greatest differences are in the blue wing
patches which are much more extensive in the Blue-wing and of a deeper
blue. Much of this blue is hidden by the wing coverts when the bird is
in repose but when it is fully exposed, as for example in display, the Blue-
winged Parrakeet is quite incredibly beautiful.
In the wild Blue-wings feed on the seeds of grasses and herbaceous
plants, fruits, berries and small insects. In captivity thev do well on the
usual diet recommended for Grass Parrakeets. Mine are fed on a mixture
containing approximately 50% canary seed, 40% mixed millets, 6% white
sunflower, 3% small striped sunflower and 1% hemp. They are given
fresh green food in the form of spinach beet, groundsel, chickweed or
dandelion, and slices of apple as frequently as possible. They receive
millet sprays dusted with P.Y.M. (Phillips yeast mixture) and Haiths
Budgerigar Tonic seed at least twice a week. They have constant access to
fresh water, mineralized grit and fresh cuttlefish. The watei is supplied
in a bowl about 8 in. in diameter and 1 in. deep in the open flight and the
seed in a similar smaller container in the aviary shelter.
The aviary for a pair of Grass Parrakeets should consist of an enclosed
shelter, a covered flight and an open flight. The shelter should be well
lit and have perches or ledges higher than anywhere else in the aviary to
encourage the birds to roost in it at night rather than in the flight. Grass
Parrakeets appear to fare better in small aviaries than in excessively large
ones. A satisfactory size for a breeding pair is 9 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. x 6 ft. high.
Mine are of these dimensions and are arranged in a series of compart-
ments. Probably the optimum size is larger and a length of about 12 ft. is
desirable. My aviaries are smaller because I live in a London suburb
where garden aviary space is severely limited. In very long aviaries
Grass Parrakeets are inclined to take fright at night and to hit the far
end of the aviary with literally break neck speed. Grass floors are best
in the open flight but they quickly become unsightly mud patches in
small enclosures. The floors of my aviary flights consist of 2 ft. x 2 ft.
frames covered with \ in. mesh wire netting laid on the earth and covered
with sand to a depth of about \ in. The sand beneath the perches is
removed and replenished frequently. In such enclosures with sand floors
it is probably beneficial for the birds to have fresh turves placed on the
ground from time to time. The perches in my aviaries consist usually of
apple tree branches and these are replaced about twice a year.
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets will take to almost any kind of nest box.
I use the vertical type 18 in. x 6 in. x 6 in. with an entrance hole z\ in.
in diameter near the top and a wire netting ladder tacked inside. They
are made from timber J in. thick treated with creosote. About 2 in. of
moist peat pressed well down is placed in the bottoms of the boxes and
they are hung in the aviary flights at the end of March. The birds
almost invariably show an immediate interest in the nest boxes and the
hens usually spend long periods scratching about in the peat preparing the

nest. Laying hardly ever commences much before the end of April. In
this respect Blue-wings are very different from Splendids and Turquoisines
which often start laying a week or so after the nest boxes have been placed
in position. I have very frequently had cases of egg binding with
Splendids and Turquoisines but never with Blue-wings. They usually
lay from four to six eggs on alternate days and commence incubation after
the appearance of the second egg. The chicks hatch after 18 to 20 days
and at first they are covered with grey down. They are brooded very
closely by the hen for the first few days and during this period she leaves
the nest only very infrequently and is fed by the cock in the nest box
entrance hole. When the young are about 10 days old she leaves them
for longer periods and the cock often begins to enter the box to feed the
chicks. Most of my hens brood their chicks at night for at least three
weeks. The chicks can be seen calling for food at the entrance holes
when they are about 30 days old and soon afterwards they leave the
nest boxes. They are a little timid at first but usually settle down and are
flying and perching confidently within a day or so. They are dull
imitations of the parents with horn coloured beaks which change to black
in two or three months. The hens frequently commence to lay a second
clutch of eggs before all the young from the first nest have left the nest
box but the cock will continue to feed the chicks which usually become
independent within a week of leaving the nest. The youngsters can be
left with the parents without coming to any harm but I usually remove
those from the first nest before the chicks from the second are
flying. Young birds are not difficult to sex at first because the males
have brighter blue wing patches than the females but this difference
becomes less apparent in a month or two after which it is no longer possible
to sex them until they have completed their first moult. This usually
takes place when they are about eight months old.
Fully mature specimens are almost invariably double brooded. Early
hatched youngsters usually have one nest during the following year but
those hatched later (second " round ") hardly ever attempt to breed until
their second season. Blue-wings have no special extra requirements when
they are breeding but they should have constant access to supplies of fresh
green food, soaked millet sprays and additional hempseed.
Occasionally a hen is inclined to lay again long before her first brood
has been reared, and deserts it. Hand-rearing of the chicks is very
easy particularly if they are not less than about 10 days old. They should
be placed in a small box with the bottom covered with plenty of peat to
absorb the excreta and kept in a fairly warm place. Many different diets
are suitable. I usually stir four teaspoonfuls of " Farex ", one teaspoonful
of " Ostermilk " and a drop of " Haliborange " with boiling water to
make a sloppy mixture which can be fed to the chicks with an eye dropper.
After a little practice the technique of administering the food straight
into the crop becomes very simple. Birds more than 10 days old need

feeding every four hours cr so and the amount of food given should be
gauged so that the crop is not quite empty when the time comes for the
next feed. When they are about four weeks old the youngsters begin to
exercise their wings and to take short flights when they are waiting for
their turn to be fed. At this stage they should be transferred to an
ordinary box cage with the floor covered with grit, canary seed and millet
sprays. They very quickly learn to shell seed and show their indepen-
dence by refusing further hand feeding. Hand-reared birds make good
specimens and, contrary to popular belief, excellent parents.
In my experience Blue-wings are the most robust of the Grass Parra-
keets. Mine are kept outdoors in unheated aviaries all the year round
and are never locked in their shelters at night. During cold damp
weather I have occasionally found an odd bird looking unwell, producing
green, very liquid excreta, suffering from enteritis. Such patients respond
miraculously to heat. They should be transferred to a hospital cage and
kept on a plain seed diet at a temperature of 85*F. until the excreta becomes
normal. The temperature may then be gradually reduced over a period
of one or two days. They can safely be transferred to the outdoor aviary
again when the weather conditions are favourable. Although I have lost
several Splendid Parrakeets from the same range of aviaries as the Blue-
wings from infestation with Ascandia , I have only once discovered the
presence of round worms in the intestine of a dead Blue-wing. However,
it is dangerous to be complacent about this avicultural scourge and I
believe that all parrakeet breeders should use one of the non-toxic
anthelminthics such as Tetramisole (Nilverm, I.C.I.) prophylactically at
least. But our knowledge of diseases in birds is very limited indeed and
probably the only really effective form of treatment for most bird ailments
is heat. I think it is significant that I have had to use a hospital cage
considerably less frequently for the Blue-wings than for any other species
of parrakeet which I have kept.
Until comparatively recently Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets were rare
and expensive in Europe. Like Splendids, Turquoisines and Elegants
they have almost suddenly become readily available in this country
mainly because of the importation of large numbers of Continental bred
specimens. Many of these are bred in cages and indoor aviaries. They
are not as robust as outdoor bred specimens as many purchasers have
found to their cost. Some of this continental bred stock is giving the
Grass Parrakeets again a reputation quite undeserved, for being delicate.
Outdoor aviary bred stock is certainly not. Keeping and breeding the
members of the genus Neophema , particularly the Blue-winged Grass
Parrakeet, has given me a great deal of interest and pleasure for more than
a decade. Now that aviary bred strains are well established I am sure
they will give as much pleasure to many others.

Bv S. T. Johnstone (The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge,
Gloucestershire, England)
Egg identification in the Anatidae is extremely difficult, not only within
the family and tribes, but also within a species itself where considerable
variation can be found in colour, size and shape.
The Magpie Goose lays a large white egg, the shell of which is thick
and pitted. The Whistling Ducks all have white thick-shelled eggs of
characteristic shape. Among the swans, the Mute and Black lay green
eggs, the rest of the forms large white ones of similar size and shape and
shell texture. The exception is the Coscoroba, which of course is
considerably smaller.
All the Grey geese produce white eggs which apart from the Greylag
vary little in size. Even the Lesser Whitefront lays a comparative large
egg for the bird.
Among the Black geese, in the numerous races of Canada Goose, they
are white and of similar shape, varying in size from maxima to minima.
The Barnacle and Ne-ne eggs are indistinguishable from most of those
of the Canadas. The Brents are smaller, as indeed are Red-breasted
Goose eggs, which are also cream in colour.
The Sheldgeese and duck eggs remain fairly consistent in colour and
size according to the species. They mostly have thin creamy coloured
shells.
In the duck world is the greatest variation. Colour changes from the
deep brown of the White-backed Duck through various shades of stone,
buff, cream and green to the beautiful eau-de-nil eggs of the Barrow's
Goldeneye.
Size differs from the goose sized eggs of the Steamer Ducks and
Eiders to those of the Hottentot Teal. Difference in the size and colour
in a particular species of duck has been most noticeable with the Shoveler,
Gadwall and Wigeon.
The following chart gives details of all forms of waterfowl eggs that
have been available at Slimbridge. In most cases a large number of eggs
has been examined, in a few instances only a single clutch has been
measured.

OBSERVATIONS ON
CAPTIVE TASMANIAN NATIVE HENS &amp; THEIR
INTERACTIONS WITH WILD MOORHENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999265461538462" page_id="58076098"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
By D. T. Holyoak and Deirdre Sager (London, England)
Ridpath (1964 and unpublished) has made extensive behaviour studies
on the Tasmanian Native Hen (Tribonyx mortieri ) in Tasmania. This note
records observations on the interactions of a single captive pair of Native
Hens with several pairs of wild Moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) at the
London Zoo. The Native Hen is a flightless, chicken-sized rail with dull
olive-green plumage relieved only by a white streak on each flank. This
species is restricted to Tasmania; an area from which moorhens of the
genus Gallinula are absent.
At the London Zoo the pair of Native Hens are kept on the " Three
Islands Pond "; they roam freely about the pond area and the surrounding
lawns and flower beds, normally walking, but sometimes swimming
buoyantly or running. They have succeeded in rearing only one chick
so far, although they made several nesting attempts in 1969. Two or
three pairs of wild Moorhens breed on the pond, taking advantage of the
food provided for pinioned ducks and geese. The Moorhens raise several
broods of young each year.
The Native Hens defend land territories from the Moorhens, partly by
chasing them, and partly by giving loud, harsh, two-syllabled aggressive
calls; this call is a duet, the female providing a lower-pitched note than the
male (this " duetting " was first noted by Ridpath 1964). Probably
because of aggression from the Native Hens, the Moorhens defend only
water territories from other Moorhen pairs. The Moorhens regularly
give their turning away territorial display showing off the white under-tail
coverts, both to other Moorhens and to the Native Hens, although the
Native Hens enter the water freely when moving between the islands in
the pond. This division of the pond area into land territories for the
Native Hens, and water territories for the Moorhens is very clearly
marked. Often a Native Hen will run ten yards to chase a Moorhen into
the water, then ignore it even though it is swimming only two or three feet
away with the white under-tail coverts fluffed. Because of this, the
Native Hens are defending three islands and parts of the land surrounding
the pond from Moorhens, but within this area two or three pairs of Moor-
hens are defending water territories between themselves.
In June 1968 three Moorhen chicks a day or two old (smaller than a
chicken's egg) were watched as they were fed first on land by the pair of
Native Hens, then in the water by a pair of Moorhens which we assumed
to be their parents. Both pairs of birds showed considerable interest in
the chicks, although the chicks appeared to be more strongly attracted to

the Moorhens. The chicks seemed to be reluctant to enter the water,
and the Moorhens were unable to visit the chicks freely on land because
of aggression from the Native Hens. During one two-hour period of
watching, the chicks were fed several dozen times by both the Moorhens
and the Native Hens. On land both species fed the chicks on small
pieces bitten from grass leaves; in the water the Moorhens picked tiny
objects (possibly insects) from the water surface.
The Moorhens made frequent attempts to approach the chicks when
they were on land, but they were usually driven back into the water by one
or other of the Native Hens. However, the Moorhens reached the
chicks a number of times, and each time the behaviour of the Native Hens
towards the Moorhens was completely different when the Moorhens were
either feeding the chicks or very close to them. Instead of chasing the
Moorhens away, the Native Hens maintained a passive indifference a few
feet away. Nevertheless, as soon as the Moorhen moved more than a few
feet away from the chicks it would be chased back into the water and
sometimes savagely pecked.
This " cutting off " of the aggression from the Native Hens when the
Moorhens managed to approach the chicks closely was striking. Two
explanations of the behaviour seem reasonable; first aggression near the
chicks may be greatly reduced because of the danger of causing injury to
the chicks in birds which are as aggressive as rails (the danger of injury
might be mainly from redirected aggression; the selective value of
reducing this near to chicks could be greater than that involved in reducing
the risk of accidental injuries), and secondly (as suggested to us by Derek
Goodwin) in natural situations there may be little point in attacking a
strange bird when it has reached chicks, as its ability to eat them would
then seem to be assured; attacking the predator at this stage might be dis-
advantageous because of the risk of injury to the adult birds. Derek
Goodwin has seen analogous behaviour in Song Thrushes, Turdus
philomelos, whose nest was being robbed by a Jay, Garrulus glandarius.
Here, the cutting off of aggression can probably best be explained by the
second of the two alternatives mentioned above.
We are grateful to Peter Olney for help in studying birds at the Regent's
Park Zoo, and to Derek Goodwin for helpful suggestions and encourage-
ment.

NYLON NETTING

By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Cheshire, England)
Visitors to my aviary frequently express interest in the use of nylon
netting. On the other hand the material is occasionally condemned by a
few who may have used it under unfavourable conditions. While nylon
netting is no substitute for wire netting, it has its use in aviculture. Where
quail, partridge and pheasant stock is housed, nylon covered enclosures
minimize head injuries which may occur when birds suddenly rise up in
flight. Young waterfowl and pheasants can be protected from winged
predators by temporarily covering their open pens with netting. Here
it is also used to cover extensive enclosures in which various research
projects are undertaken. Normal practice is to cover an enclosure for
9 months of the year, removing the netting for the winter.
Nylon netting, being so light in weight, can be used to cover very large
areas by the use of a few cross wires. It is not subject to temperature
changes 01 frost, but like all other synthetic netting is liable to damage
from the ultra-violet rays of the sun, and for this reason it is necessary to
treat it every year or so. It is quite a simple process to bundle the netting
in a bale by tying it up with twine, the neater the mass is compacted the
easier the next stage, which is simply dipping it in whatever preparation
is being used. The net-makers recommend black tar or bitumen.
A creosote and bitumen mixture acts very well. This dipping process
can be carried out in a bath, drum or any handy container, the treated
netting being left to become drip dry. The object of such treatment is to
dye the netting a dark colour, this being necessary when it is being used
out of doors.
The breaking strains of the twines from which the nylon netting is
made are very high. The netting is sold in several grades, according to
the number of twines used. Complete nets of any size are made to mea-
sure, where rectangular measurements are given. There is a wide range of
mesh sizes and the netting sets squarely without any stretching. It is an
advantage to have the netting corded on all sides at an extra cost of a
few pence. All twine nettings are subject to abrasion and although nylon
is very strong it will gradually rub through on wires or other supports
if there is any undue movement. It is therefore very necessary to see
that the nets are securely tied down in order to prevent as much move-
ment as possible. This has not always been carried out here and nets
have suffered by the wind creating a continuous rippling wave action,
resulting in netting fatigue, especially at the edges where it was secured.
One system tried out here could be called the suspension method.
Wires were strung across a 60 ft. x 60 ft. unit at about 3 ft. intervals from
north to south and east to west, giving a criss-cross pattern. Ex W.D.
telephone wire was used. The netting was laid on top and secured

around the sides by using 3 ft. long, 1 in. x J in. strips of wood nailed to
the surrounding framework. Wires were strung from the apex of an
adjacent roof running parallel to one side of the unit and across to the
other side (see sketch). Ties from the suspension wires were made to
the criss-cross wires on which the net lay. It was thus possible to suspend
the complete net from above, the absence of ground supports being desir-
able since mechanical cultivators were used to till the soil. While this
method proved satisfactory it took some time to set up and there was
trouble removing the net, there being so many ties to undo. Also there
was some chafing of the netting where the vertical ties made contact.
I The following season one central pole, placed in a few minutes, did away
with the suspension idea. Where one central pole is used it is necessary
to fix the cross wires which come in contact with it underneath all other
wires in order that all other wires are raised when the pole is placed in
position.
Rats occasionally try to establish themselves in the area and can be
very destructive to nylon netting. The pests run up the surrounding
woodwork, bite a hole in the netting and gain access to the aviary. Fre-
quent visits results in the netting being destroyed. To overcome this a
perimeter of wire netting was fixed around all sides of the aviary. The
] perimeter is a 1-3 ft. width of wire netting forming the edge of the aviary
roof and attached to the top edge of the side walls, projecting inwards and
supported below by horizontal or slanting wood supports. The nylon
netting which forms the main part of the roof of the flight is attached to
1 the inner edges of this wire netting, with a small overlap. If the flight is
not built on to another flight or shelter there is some advantage in allowing
the wire netting perimeter to project outwards around the top edge of the
aviary for about 6 in. This acts as a barrier to cats and similar predators.
This proved 100% successful. In addition, with frequent use the edges
&apos; of nets became frayed and by the use of the wire netting perimeter nets
were given a new lease of life. The wire netting surround also prevented
cats from gaining access to enclosures when the nylon netting was removed
for libertv experiments. Some cheap grades of nylon netting can be torn
by Tawny Owls striking at birds in aviaries.

When fixing on a large net it is first taken to a neighbouring field,
pegged out, the corners marked and the net rolled up in one long strip
and then folded up for easy carriage. Taking the wind direction into
account, the netting is unfolded along one side of the aviary and made
secure. It is then unrolled, the wind being a great help. When netting
is removed it is usual practice to mark the corners with some ties and
again make full use of the wind. A soft broom is also used to piod
upwards at the netting in order that it be rolled or folded to one side.
The net-makers do not state how long nets last as this very much
depends on the prevailing local weather conditions during the time that
they are in use. Nylon netting is not intended as a permanent cover for
aviaries but is primarily used during the breeding season. However, in
order to put it to some sort of test a square yard was permanently fixed
over a safety door entrance. The net of f in. mesh made up of the
cheapest quality one strand netting withstood 6 b in. of snow. The
netting sold as aviary quality is several times stronger, in fact it can
support a man grasping with one hand. It is, of course, several times the
price. The cheapest grade of nylon netting costs less than wire netting
of the same mesh, while the top grade of nylon is more expensive.
While we do seem to receive sufficient sunlight to affect nylon nets in
this country, snow presents the biggest problem. Aviaries are flimsy
structures and where nylon is employed this is even more so the case.
Tests were carried out by leaving a 50 ft. x 50 ft. unit cover by nylon all
the winter. Result, total collapse after a 6J in. fall of snow. The
structure withstood 3 in. and 4 in. falls. It was the surrounding framework
and the cross wires which fractured, bringing the netting down over trees
enclosed in the aviary. The netting was extensively torn. The total
weight of snow was calculated at over 3 tons, assuming 1 in. of rain is
equivalent to 1 ft. of fresh snow and one cubic foot of water weighs 62-3- lbs.
Where the perimeter wire netting is fixed it has been found unnecessary
to remove members of the pheasant family when the nylon roof was
removed. While nylon netting has never been fixed here in the vertical
position, reports have been received of birds being caught up under such
conditions.

[Lanius schach)
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
The following most unscientific--not to say sentimental--notes were
prepared for publication before the interesting and informative article by
Herr Reinhard Hoppe appeared in print (Avicultural Magazine 5, 75,
1969, 161-164). Since there is so much that he says with which I agree--
though not all, which is hardly surprising--and the case-history of the
one bird which I have recorded here bears out so well some of the points
which he makes, I have amended slightly what I have written so as to
emphasize points of agreement and disagreement. I feel sure that what
both he and I have written will, at the very least, cause a lifting of the eye-
brows of both the " for and against mealworm " brigades, but this will
be all to the good if future aviculturists benefit from our experiences.
On the question of mealworms, may I say at once that I am very much
on the side of the " ayes ", and that I use them almost exclusively for
hand-rearing. My wife and I have hand-reared, from the small nestling
stage, Hoopoes Upupa epops , Rollers Coracius garrulus , Black-eared
Wheatears Oenanthe hispanica , Rufous Bush-chats Agrobates galactotes ,
Woodchat Shrikes Lanius senator , among many other species, on practically
nothing else, most of the birds living to a ripe old age. The Black-eared
Wheatears bred at seven years old (for the first time, having fought bitterly
until then!) and one of the Rollers is now at Birdland, Bourton-on-the-
Water, hale and hearty in his tenth year. I am sure that it is most
important to remember that all these birds had " a good dietetic start ",
in that they were fed on natural food by their parents until about ten days
old, a quite different matter from being fed only on mealworms from
hatching. May I hasten to add that I know that many outstanding first-
breedings have been achieved on mealworms alone but, however much I
favour them, I think it fair comment to say that it is probable that in such
cases success has been despite the mealworms and not because of them!
It may be of interest to note here that Great Grey Shrikes Lanius
excubitor, though eating mealworms with relish and disgorging pellets
which contain only the skin, heads, and claws, do not eat maggots readily
and seem quite unable to digest them, bringing up a mass of whole
maggots shortly after swallowing them. On the other hand, they eat
blow-fly pupae and the resulting pellets contain the cases only. My pair
killed off two broods of their nestling by giving them nothing but these.
The young could not digest the cases and were not old enough to regurgitate
pellets. As a result, post-mortem examination showed death to be due
to an impacted mass of blow-fly pupal cases. I shall take good care that
the parents do not have access to them again during the breeding season.

M. D. ENGLAND--THE RUFOUS-BACKED SHRIKE
I obtained my Rufous-backed Shrikes by mistake. A year or two
before, the female of my pair of Bay-backed Shrikes Lanius vittatus had
died, and all my efforts to find a replacement had failed. They are such
lovely little shrikes, with most intriguing ways, that I thought I would
make one last attempt by accepting responsibility for a whole consignment
from India of up to a dozen, in the hope that there would be an odd female
among them. Dealers tell me that they do not like shrikes since they are
often difficult to sell. I cannot understand why, because it would be
hard to find a family of birds which is more rewarding in captivity and
with such interesting habits.
In due course a telephone message told me that ten had arrived " but
only seven are alive this morning ". This was not surprising, since all
ten had been put together in a large cage. Few birds are more murderously
territorial, and out of the breeding season those at the lower end of the
pecking order, if they escape death by violence, would meet it by starva-
tion. I was also told that " there didn't seem to be any Bay-backed
among them " ! My unprintable reply to the effect that, whatever species
they were, they must immediately be separated was, I am thankful to say,
acted upon but I was in a quandary because, since I work in a hospital,
I was not going to be able to get home until Friday night at the earliest
and this was only Tuesday. John Yealland very kindly came to the
rescue by offering to look after them all pending sorting out.
Of the original ten birds, four had been Great Grey Shrikes Lanius
excubitor and six Rufous-backed Lamus Schach. There now remained
two grey and five of the others, one of the latter looking very seedy indeed.
On the Friday night I made a start by taking home the two greys, followed
a week later by two of the Rufous-backed. The choice of a " pair " was
by sheer guesswork because sexual plumage differences in the latter
species, if any, require a more discerning eye than mine. They were put
in a divided cage with a wire partition, which was a mistake because next
morning both had their faces covered in blood. Cardboard reinforcement
to the partition lasted only a very short time before they managed to
"get at '' each other, so they were soon moved to adjacent small flights
in a bird-room. These are little more than large cages, with a floor area of
less than three feet square. Although they could, of course, see each other,
fighting stopped and they ignored each other completely.
The normal daily feed for the pair, except when feeding young, consists
of about 25 mealworms, and/or 30 or more maggots, locusts and wasps as
available, and about half an ounce of lean ox-heart chopped up small and
rolled in soft-food, Vionate, powdered cuttle, yeast powder and occasion-
ally powdered baby food.
I had no spare aviaries and, if I thought about it at all, I dismissed all
thoughts of breeding until next year. Indeed, one day I found one of them
sitting on the window ledge looking very sick. I was just turning away to
reach for an infra-red lamp when I saw her do a little " shuffle she

was not sick but " broody A handful of dry grass proved it, for she
immediately flew down and, gathering an immense beakful, started looking
for a site in her very bare quarters. I hastily fixed up a bundle of twigs
and a rolled-up piece of wire netting, and within a couple of hours the
latter had a nest in it. Meanwhile the other bird next door had taken no
notice at all. I thought that at least I might get some indication of its
sex if I put it in with the other, so, prepared for murder, I opened the
communicating door. Within a very short while another nest had been
built in the bundle of twigs. Two hens!
By this time John Yealland's place had been taken by Peter Olney and
I quickly arranged to try the other shrikes one at a time until one gave
signs that it was a male. However, by the following weekend and before
I could do this, one of the first pair was incubating three eggs in the nest
in the wire and was being fed by the other bird. No signs of courtship or
mating were seen and, although by now we were calling the sitting one
" she ", the sex of the other was still in some doubt because, while it
certainly occasionally fed the sitting bird, it continued to add to the other
nest in a desultory way.
A fortnight later doubts were dispelled by the sitting bird, on receipt of
a mealworm from the other, rising and passing it on to something beneath
it, and when I cautiously put my head in the door to feed them I received a
sharp blow on the nose from an enraged dive-bomber. (Although he
never attacked my wife, he always came screaming down at me. When,
later on, I wanted to examine the nest I must have looked pretty silly
climbing in the door with a hat on!)
No parents could have tended their young more carefully, though they
refused to feed them with anything but mealworms, despite the fact that
they themselves were used to a mixed diet. Every possible alternative
was tried, but they starved the young rather than give them any other kind
of food. Even mealworms with the slightest touch of Abidec,
Vionate or yeast powder were not touched, or only eaten by the parents.
At the end of a fortnight it was apparent that all was not well, because
the female was still brooding most of the time and no gaping beaks were
visible when either she or her mate carried food to the nest. When they
began bringing the food away from the nest uneaten, I decided that I
must investigate. The enraged parents were shut away while I miserably
removed two fully-feathered but moribund youngsters. One was very
dead indeed, but the other had a faint spark of life. Its open beak was
crammed with putrefying food, it lay limp in my hand and it had not the
strength even to lift its head. Its eyes were closed, it lay on its side, and
its toes were deformed and in what, had it been human, would have been
described as a " talipes equino varus " position. Every now and then
its whole body was racked by a violent spasm. Poor little mite, the kind
thing would have been to put it out of its misery. But a Rufous-backed
Shrike . . . and what an exercise in hand-rearing!

It is one thing to hand-rear a young bird which is healthy and has had a
natural start from a nutritional point of view; quite another in circum-
stances such as these, where the most optimistic diagnosis was polyneuritis
with paralysis and possibly also rickets, almost certainly resulting from a
dietary deficiency. He (it quickly became " George "--even my violent
dislike of anthropomorphism could not resist this) was wrapped in a cloth,
with a thermometer beside him, and put under a " non-luminous " lamp
set to maintain about ioo*F. The food-stuffed bill was cleaned up and
he was left for an hour. To our great relief he had defaecated, and
thereafter his bed was lined with a frequently-changed piece of toilet
paper. Force-feeding began, with chopped-up mealworms treated with
Cytacon, Abidec or cod-liver oil and dipped in Meritene (a well-balanced
baby and invalid food manufactured in Portugal under licence from the
D. H. Doyle Pharmaceutical Company). Later he was forced to consume
large quantities of Vionate. At first it was difficult to get the food down,
because paralysis had affected swallowing and the little tongue hung out
to one side of the bill. But soon he began feebly to gape, his eyes opened--
though one appeared to be sightless--and as each succeeding morning
found him still alive we began to realise that our belief that he was
improving was not just wishful thinking. He could raise his head when
he gaped, swallowing became less and less of an effort, he even tried to lift
himself on his poor little crippled feet.
At a month old he was trying to grip with the toes of one foot, he looked
around alertly with both eyes, and he called incessantly for food. It
looked as though we were really winning. By now he ruled the whole
household. And then, tragedy! One evening before being closed down
for the night he was enjoying his usual freedom of the room, flying from
shoulder to shoulder, when one of our dogs nosed open the door and,
although it made no aggressive movement, George took fright. He flew
to the only place where he could hurt himself--the slightly-open door of
a cupboard where he caught his head in the crack and fell to the floor
unmoving and apparently dead. With a heavy heart I picked up the
little body. There seemed no doubt this time. And yet there was the
faintest pulse, though he was completely unconscious. Once more the
cloth bed and heat, though this time with no hope at all. At the crack of
dawn I went sadly to look. There he lay, eyes closed, head sagging, bill
slightly open--but alive.
It was not a question of " going back to square one "--we were further
back than when we started. But once more--heat, force-feeding, gross
over-doses of everything we knew; the blindness, the paralysis, the useless
toes, the poor lolling tongue. And once more George slowly came back.
He is now, in early January, nearly six months old. He lives in a cage
though he prefers to be out of it, flying from shoulder to shoulder and
exploring the room. He can, of course, feed himself perfectly well,
though he shouts continually to be fed, or perhaps for a game or a ride on

our hand. He grips a perch with both feet, though one will never be
much good to him. During his freedom of the room, he finds it easier to
hang from the curtains than to perch on slippery furniture.
When we are too busy to do more than put his food in the cage and he
feels neglected, he gets in a rage and, after a period of shouting, he tears
up the newspaper in his cage and fills the water pot with it or pokes it
through the wire so that it floats all over the floor of the room. He also
violently pecks the first outstretched hand.
By 30th October (at nearly fifteen weeks old) adult plumage had been
assumed except for some very faint brown barring of the flanks. This is
much quicker than any record of which I am aware for any other species of
shrike. For some time it was assumed to be female because, whenever I
approached closely or put out a hand to pick her up, she " crouched " in
what looked like an invitatory posture, to me, her supranormal mate.
However, I now know that I was wrong about this, since this posture is
the means whereby the parents resolve a squabble or fight. The dominant
bird, though obviously still " raring to go ", desists when its opponent
crouches, head right down pointing at the floor, in submission. I only
hope they will continue to settle their differences in this way, since I
simply cannot spare separate aviaries for them.
Directly he was able to move about his cage he began trying to impale or
wedge his food. Although various species of shrikes have been hand-reared
before and it seems unlikely that they learned impaling from seeing it done
by their parents, it is probable that this is the first occasion when a
youngster which was blind on removal from its parents has impaled
immediately it was strong enough to do so, thus showing conclusively
that the action is innate. In the same context it is worthy of note that
his warning notes and song are normal although he cannot possibly have
heard any of his own species since he was a fortnight old. It may be of
interest to add that, in addition to food, he impales pieces of newspaper.
He is now no longer as tame as he was, since we have less time to devote
to him, and when his cage is approached in such a way that he cannot see
that the approaching person is one with whom he is familiar, he performs
bill-snapping, similar to that done by owls in like circumstances.
Since I am away from home at least three days and nights each week,
the credit, if any, goes largely to my wife, who devoted herself to yet
another foundling with an unshakable determination that he should live.

Keeping and breeding foreign doves and pigeons is a hobby that poses
many problems and difficulties. Especially true is this when it comes to
the rarer varieties of foreign doves and pigeons, concerning whose living
habits in the wild we know but very little. Take the Key-West Quail
Dove, for example, that handsome, gentle, almost pigeon-sized bird,
which made its debut in this country not many years ago, and which
today is found in limited numbers in a few fanciers' aviaries.
These doves are mainly chestnut-brown above and duller brown on the
wings, with extensive irridescence of green and purple, not only on the
top of the head and neck but also over most of the back. The sides of
the head are dark brown with a conspicuous white streak below the eye;
and the throat is white. The underside is mauvish-grey, browner on the
flanks and whiter on the belly.
I happen to be one of the fortunate owners of several pairs of Key-West
Quail Doves, Geotrygon chrysia , which have been living, and modestly
breeding, in my aviaries now for several years. All of them, without
exception, are descended from the first pair, there having been no fresh
imports of this very interesting, beautiful dove in recent years. In other
words, the offspring produced is the result of in-breeding, of mating
closely related members of one family with one another.
On rare occasions such matings will bring forth surprisingly strange
colour patterns, which in no wise resemble the plumage colour of the
parent bird. Well, I am happy to report such a radical colour variation,
namely a dilute form of Key-West Quail Dove, which is, in all probability,
the only representative of this variant. The breast and under parts are
almost white, the head, neck, back, wings, and tail are an off-white, and
when closely examined are very pale buff and light grey. All the colouring
is considerably reduced and the iridescence disappears. The eyes are a
very bright, sharp red. At this writing the bird is nearly full grown, to all
appearances lively and vigorous. In shape and form, and habit, it is
and acts like a normal Key-West Quail Dove. To date its actions have
not as yet revealed its sex. Depending on it, I plan to mate this unique
dove back to its male or female parent in the hope of getting another
dilute, or near dilute specimen, which together I might utilize to produce
a strain or family of variant Key-West Quail Doves. Needless to say,
I am both surprised and delighted with this happy event, and I hope to
report in the future on the breeding results from this dilute Key-West
Quail Dove.
Some years ago, there was a request from a conseivation group in
Key-West, Florida, hoping to purchase a few doves for restocking. It is

By H. Smyth (Manley, New South Wales, Australia)
I recently returned from Papua-New Guinea after spending almost
I two years there, mainly in the Southern Highlands District, where I
spent most of my leisure time birdwatching, though I did manage to keep
a few birds in cages for short periods, so perhaps a few notes may be of
&apos; interest.
Without doubt the most interesting members of my small collection
were a Blue Bird of Paradise Paradisaea rudolphi and a Lawes' six-plumed
Bird of Paradise Parotia lazvesi , purchased as fledglings at Tari markets.
Market days are held twice weekly at Tari where the natives offer a
wide range of locally produced produce, and occasionally birds, too, are
offered for sale and with the possible exception of parrots, most birds
I have seen for sale at the markets have been quite young and unable to
feed themselves. I was first aware that fledgling Birds of Paradise
could be bought, when a friend asked me to identify a bird offered to
him by a local Tari boy.
It was quite clearly a Blue Bird of Paradise, not long out of the nest
 |and though it looked healthy and gaped readily it made no attempt to fly,
but sat in the boy's open hand in such a relaxed wav that I believed it to
have been hand-reared.
Regulations concerning the keeping of Birds of Paradise within the
territory are quite definite so my friend was reluctant to buy, but after
being assured by his house boy, who was acting as interpreter, that the
blue bird, if not sold, would surely be eaten, he paid the twenty cents
asked.
Unfortunately this bird died after a few days and I suspect that like
birds subsequently bought by me it had been disabled, prior to capture,
by being hit by a stick or stone thrown by the boys, who are surprisingly
accurate.
On 13th July 1968 I bought at the market a young Lawes' six-plumed
Parotia which had an injured leg but otherwise appeared healthy, and it
also gaped readily.
Insects and fruit seemed a reasonable guess as to its food requirements,
and after a worrying first few days the youngster settled down to a diet of
insects, mostly cicadas and moths attracted to the lights at night, and
paw-paw and bananas mashed together with powdered milk. Mashed

<bodyText confidence="0.999116244444444" page_id="58076114"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
paw-paw and powdered milk later proved to be more satisfactory, for if
allowed to stand for an hour or more this mush becomes quite firm, is
enjoyed by the birds, does not soil the feathers to any great extent and
droppings are much firmer than when banana is added, again reducing
the risk of fouled plumage.
On 31st August I acquired, for 20 cents, a beautiful young Blue Bird
of Paradise, similar to the one mentioned previously, though much
brighter in colour but unfortunately more knocked about than the previous
bird.
Again, after a very shaky start, it began to do well but later sloughed
two toes which were broken when I bought it.
Both birds became very tame and when anyone approached crouched
down on the perch, gaped widely and with quivering wings begged for
food.
The Blue Bird made quite a feature of wing quivering and continued to
do so up until the time I disposed of it at about five months old.
I suspect this is a habit of the species, for when visiting Tari at a later
date, February 1969, I was resting in a thick patch of forest when a young
fully grown Blue Bird perched quite close to me. This bird, though not
in full colour, had lost most of its juvenile plumage and had blue in the
lesser wing coverts.
Whilst studying it through my binoculars I was surprised to see a
handsome bird, presumably its mother, alight alongside it. The young
bird went through all the previously described begging motions, though
it was fully as big as its parent and the older bird proceeded to feed it five
small black berries, probably stored in its throat or beak, since it made no
display of regurgitation as would a pigeon.
Both birds sat together for a while and a striking difference was the
size of the adult's beak as compared with the younger bird. The pale
grey colour of the adult beak may have helped give an impression of
greater size and though perhaps no longer, I feel sure its other dimensions
were considerably larger.
The Lawes' six-plumed in juvenile plumage resembles the mature hen,
with black head and brown body, underparts barred with darker brown.
These brown birds, with occasional fully coloured males, could often
be seen feeding in berry-bearing trees near native gardens and in timbered
areas. One peculiarity of the young bird is two tufts of feathers on its
head, probably in the position where the plumes normally grow.
These small tufts stand about a quarter of an inch above the other
head feathers but are only noticeable when the bird erects all its head
feathers, as it occasionally does.
What prompts the young bird to do this I am unable to say for sure,
but suspect it to be an attempt at display, though I have seen the head
feathers raised when a large bird flew past, but fright will not always
bring this reaction.

H. SMYTH--HAND-REARING AND OBSERVING BIRDS OF PARADISE
In October 1968 I returned to Sydney and left my birds with a friend
at Kagua, where they were housed in a mixed collection, including tree
kangaroos, wallabies and cuscus.
It was late in November when we were reunited at Mendi and the
change the separation had brought was surprising, particularly in the
Parotia, which was extremely fit and aggressive and attacked me savagely
whenever I put my arm in the cage.
I was forced to separate the birds since the Blue Bird looked so shabby
as compared to its companion whose feathers, though still coloured like
the female, were quite glossy.
The Blue Bird was still friendly and confiding and as mentioned
previously begged for titbits and with a little extra care was soon back to
normal.
Feeding was something of a problem since Mendi is cooler than other
stations of similar altitude, and many fruits, such as paw-paw are not
available, but both birds proved themselves adaptable and ate, reluctantly
at times, tinned fruit, raisins, tomatoes, minced steak and even fish.
However, the food position was not entirely satisfactory and when at
the end of December 1968 I learned that a friend was going to visit the
Baiyer River sanctuary I asked him to take both birds along to Fred Shaw-
Mayer, who was then in charge.
Birds of Paradise appear hardy and are certainly easier to hand-rear
than many common birds here in Australia.
I think the diet I gave them was not quite adequate since neither bird
flew well. However, I could not detect anything wrong with their wings.
The Lawes' six-plume and the Superb are perhaps the most common
of the Birds of Paradise in the Southern Highlands area.
Though more secretive and less noisy than the Superb, they, the
Lawes' six-plume, are reasonably numerous both in heavily timbered
country and more open areas and do not appear at higher altitudes than
about 6,000 ft. They are often heard and less often seen as one walks
along native tracks in timbered areas and keeping low in dense cover the
birds utter their harsh call and appear at times to follow one for short
distances.
Playgrounds belonging to this species are fairly easy to find in most
areas and at Tari, within half a mile of the council house, in a few acres of
heavy timber, adjacent to native gardens I spent some time observing and
trying to photograph both Lawes' six-plumed and Blue Birds of Paradise.
There were two playgrounds in this area within a few yards of one
another and whenever one approached closely, no matter from what
direction, the Parotids harsh cry would ring out and usually a fully
coloured male would be seen for a moment.
On one occasion, five birds, including the adult male, came on my
approach and stayed close by for a while. Four were of similar colour

to the female, though one had plumes. I had seen this bird on more than
one occasion and believe its head feathers to be more glossy than the others.
Both cleared areas were roughly of the same area (about 40 to 50 square
feet). One roughly oval and the other very irregular, and I saw no
evidence of decoration on either.
Each had a horizontal or near horizontal branch close by and within
5 ft. of the ground. These branches appeared much used and how they
came to be bent over in such a way I am unable to say, obviously too
strong for these birds to bend, I suspect it is the presence of a horizontal
stick which influences the choice of play area. The Blue Birds of Paradise
which often share this patch of timber were usually easy to find, since
their call is so characteristic and loud.
At a distance it reminds me of the clang of hammer on steel, but on
closer approach this resemblance does not hold, however the call is quite
loud and distinctive.
At close quarters and in dense undergrowth one can often be guided to
the Blue Bird by his habit of mumbling (as though talking to itself) during
preening and partial display, and by following this call I have come within
a few yards of a splendid male, displaying upside down, less than 6 ft.
from the ground, but surrounded by heavy undergrowth. Although
obvious of my presence and keeping a watchful eye on me, this bird
continued to display for at least a minute.
Though these Blue Birds eat fruit, I have never seen them feeding with
other species but have often watched them hopping along moss-covered
branches probing about for insects and on one occasion I saw a well-
plumed male bird moving up the trunk of a dead tree in the manner of a
tree creeper.
The accompanying photograph of the playground of Lawes' six-plumed
Bird of Paradise was taken at Karoba about 25 miles from Tari. Despite
its rather untidy appearance I think this one was still in use since it was
the warning calls of the bird which caused me to investigate the area.
Most playgrounds, though generally similar to the one pictured, are kept&apos;
very clean and free from fallen leaves, etc. Because of the much heavier
timber growth and consequent poor light, the other playgrounds mentioned
could not satisfactorily be photographed.

Once again I had the pleasure of visiting Brazil in November 1969,
spending a couple of weeks with my friend Dr. E. P. Beraut near Rio de
Janeiro. His collection of tropical birds and plants looked better than
ever. Gardening and bird-keeping in a warm country are particularly
rewarding--there is very little trouble caused by the climate, although the
most delicate species should be well sheltered from winds during the cooler
season, and you can enjoy your collections outdoors every month of the
year. Dr. Beraut's garden is large and hilly, situated at the foot of a
rocky mountain, close to two others (Gavea and Tijuca) and also to the
ocean.
It looks like a huge conservatory, as the plants are those seen in the
hot-houses of botanical gardens, but, of course, grown on a much
bigger scale. The trees are overloaded with orchids, bromeliads and other
epiphytes. There is a rushing torrent over rocks and several pools. A
few Trumpeters, Demoiselles, Crowned Cranes, Scarlet Ibises, Roseate
Spoonbills and Egrets have the run of the grounds, and wild birds are
numerous on the trees and bushes, the commonest of which are the
Tricolored Tanager and several species of Hummingbirds. Dozens of
them are always buzzing around the verandah where bottles of nectar are
kept ready for them. The most numerous are the Dusky Jacobine
(Melanotrochilus fuscus ) and the Blue-headed Wood-Nymph ( Thalurania
glaucopis), but Swallowtails ( Eupetomena macroura ), Mangos
(Anthracothorax nigricollis ) and Brazilian Violet-ears ( Colibri serrirostris)
also come to drink. A female Pigmy Hermit had a nest in a nearby bush,
but she never sought the bottles.
Although there are 25 aviaries, large and small, and more in the making,
none can be seen when you walk through the grounds. All are built
along the outer fences, sheltered by walls and hidden by shrubbery.
With the exception of those occupied by parrots, all are heavily planted.
Three of the flights are of large size and full of trees and plants. They
are close together, but irregular in shape. A corridor divides two of them
and gives access to a bird kitchen and to shelters where caged birds and
hand-fed fledglings are kept. Nine compartments run along the back of
the third aviary, and plans are made for making another dozen of those
breeding accommodations, where pairs of birds are secluded. At present,
they consist of several pairs of Eclectus Parrots, most of them reared there,
some Toucanets, Motmots, Taccazze Sunbirds, Garnet-throated Hum-
mingbirds, Blue and Golden-breasted Sugarbirds, Fairy Bluebirds, the
latter with young. When pairs of birds are showing signs of nesting in
the larger aviaries, they are quickly removed to the privacy of these
breeding pens. The corridor is the home of a few pets--a Razorbill
Curassow, a Sun Bittern and a Purple-capped Lory.

The three large flights contain remarkable species of soft-billed Passerine
birds, exotic as well as South American, of which it no doubt is the best
collection existing today.
The first one is inhabited by a pair of Umbrella Birds ( Cephalopterus
penduliger ), and three male and two female Guianan Cock of the Rock
(Rupicola rupicola). They are all tame, agree perfectly well, the male
Cocks of the Rock displaying together. A Lesser Bird of Paradise has
been there for eight years and is in superb plumage. A pair of Blue-
winged Pittas and a Brazilian Ant-Pitta ( Grallaria varia) also live in peace
as well as a few smaller birds: Golden-winged Sunbirds, a Waterton's
Wood-Nymph, and a few small Formicariidae , including the lovely Pithys
albifrons, a small black and chestnut ant-catcher, with a crested white face
of the most unusual appearance. I have seen long ago these curious
birds following army ants in French Guiana whence Charles Cordier
brought some to Cleres later on.
Another large flight is the home of Central American and Golden-
headed Quetzals, Scarlet Cocks of the Rock, a number of Cotingas: a lovely
and tame Swallow-tailed [Phibalura flaviventris), a Bare-necked Fruitcrow
(Gymnoderus foetidus ) and a Black-necked Tityra ( 7 . cay ana)&apos;, a Swallow-
winged Puff bird [Chelidoptera tenebrosa), various Tanagers, Scarlet-
chested Sunbirds; several small Hummingbirds ( Sericotes hclosericeus,
Augastes lumachellus, Stephanoxis lalandei)&apos;, White-capped Redstarts
(Chimarrhornis), Royal, Splendid, Amethyst Starlings, American Jacanas
(nesting), different Plovers, etc.
The largest aviary (about 35 ft. x 25 ft.), heavily planted, has a little
winding river where Cotton Teal can swim; there are also Roulrouls and
small Rails [Lateralius leucopyrrhus ); but it is otherwise dedicated to small
species. There are Sunbirds [N. pulchella), Hummingbirds of several
sorts, Paradise Tanagers, different Sugarbirds, Flowerpeckers ( Dicaeum ),
African Paradise Flycatchers, a few Old World Robins, and Blue Cotingas.
But most remarkable is the collection of Manakins, which live there in
perfect condition and never quarrel: Pipra fascicauda, P. erythrocephala
P. rubrocapilla, P. pipra, P. serena, Manacus manacus, Chiroxiphia linearis ,
C. caudata, C. pareola, Elicura militaris, Machaeropterus pyrocephalus, and
the magnificent Antilophiagaleata, a fairly large Manakin from the interior
of Brazil (I found it common in Goias), black, with scarlet helmeted head
and back.
There are other groups of aviaries. Two good-sized ones contain pairs
of African Pigmy Kingfishers, Irena's Pittas, Jamaican Long-tailed
Hummingbirds, Blue-and-White Indian Flycatchers and a few others.
Five more are inhabited by Ross and White-headed Touracous, Short-
tailed Antthrushes ( Chamaeza ), Gnateaters ( Conopophaga ), several species
of small Rails, Roulrouls, etc. There are pairs of Leadbeater's Cockatoos
and Queen of Bavaria's Conures in a large flight. The conures were laying
in a log, but it is interesting to note that the Cockatoos, although in perfect

condition, have never nested, probably due to the lack of a cold enough
winter and of too much humidity. Elsewhere live several Toucanets
(Aulacorhynchus sulcatus, Pteroglossus beauharnaiesi, P. bitorquatus) a
number of Hummingbirds, Sunbirds, and various small insect and fruit
eaters.
At the time of my visit, many nestlings collected very young
in Dr. Beraut's extensive land holdings at Tapirapuan, Mato Grosso, were
being hand-raised. The most interesting ones were 16 Trogons of four
species ( T . strigilatus, melanurus , curucui , collaris)\ Cotingas, Puff birds,
&apos; Swallow Tanagers ( Tersina ) and 17 Jacamars ( Galbula ruficauda). These
were in broods of three or four. Very small when I arrived, they grew up
rapidly and were flying and perching within 10 or 12 days. Absurdly
tame, they were fed every hour on small, soft pellets composed of one-
third ground beef heart, one-third grated carrots, one-third maize cake
(cooked). These highly insectivorous birds are perfectly raised on that
diet, which they continue to eat when grown up. They live so well on it
jl that they have attempted to nest, digging in an artificial bank. But they
are quarrelsome birds, and the female injured the male. Adult-caught
Jacamars always refuse any food but live mealworms and never lived
long; Dr. Beraut hardly gives any to his Jacamars, mealworms being
scarce in Brazil. There was also an excellent young Squirrel Cuckoo
(Piaya cayana) and a Nightjar, fed the same way as were the young
Trogons.
Because of various difficulties in procuring certain foods, all birds in
Dr. Beraut's aviaries receive that same meat-carrot-maize bread mixture,
with diced cheese and for fruit, cut-up tomato and papaya, and occasionally
grapes; practically nothing else. They all remain in perfect health as
well as in excellent plumage and colour; all the red tones are perfectly
preserved by the carotenes contained in tomatoes and carrots.
Because of lack of time, I never could visit all the different collections
in the Rio area, nor pay a visit to Dr. Ruschi at Santa Teresa, in the State
of Espfrito Santo. But I saw those of Mr. Mario Ventura and Dr.
Augusto Nim Ferreira, in Rio, as well as the aviaries of Mr. Nelson
Kawall, Mr. Jorge Arnhold, and of the Zoological Park in Sao Paulo,
all of great interest.
Air. Ventura and Dr. Ferreira live in town and have very little outdoor
space. They, however, keep remarkably large and fine collections of
birds, both native and exotic, either in rather small aviaries or in cages.
Mr. Ventura has a number of outdoor flights, not very big, but cleverly
designed to save space, in which are housed many Hummingbirds,
Manakins, Tanagers, Sugarbirds and other small softbills, all in perfect
J condition. He also keeps, isolated in cages in his house, a number of
hard-bills, mostly hybrids and colour mutations of Seedeaters ( Sporophila )
and Rice-Grosbeaks ( Oryzoborus ), many of them marvellous songsters.

It appears that there is in nature a large proportion of unmated female
Oryzoborus because so many males are captured and kept as singing cage
birds. The result is the occurrence of hybrids between them and males of
various Sporophila. These natural hybrids are eagerly sought for.
Dr. Ferreira has even less outdoor room than Mr. Ventura and most of
his birds are kept in cages. His collection is large and varied, including,
besides small birds, Woodpeckers and Parrots. They also are beautifully
kept and in admirable condition.
Mr. N. Kawall, in Sao Paulo, possesses an extensive garden, where
he has built a long double row of aviaries. He also disposes of many
cages in a hall. He specializes in plumage aberrations of native birds,
which he propagates. He owns variants of many species. I particularly
noticed a beautiful Troupial, whose normally black parts are of a light
vinaceous brown, Blue Tanagers with white underparts and a series of
freak Saffron Finches, some pure lutinos.
Mr. J. Arnhold, also in Sao Paulo, has quite a different collection.
He keeps and rears on a large scale, both in extensive outdoor aviaries
which fill up a large walled garden, and in breeding box cages inside
galleries, very complete collections of Finches and Parakeets, mostly
Australian. It is all done according to the most modern techniques and
very well kept.
My visit to the Sao Paulo Zoological Park was a very pleasant surprise--
I had not been in that city for 14 years, and at that time, there was
no zoo of any importance. I knew that a new one had been built since,
but I had no idea that it was either so large or so good. True to say, it
has not been entirely finished and certain accommodations, mostly for the
larger animals, have not yet been built permanently. But all that have
been completed are particularly excellent and attractive; and it happens
that many of them are dedicated to birds.
This new zoo is situated outside of the huge city, among parks and
wooded hills, and extends over a considerable area. There is a large
and beautiful lake, with perhaps a hundred swans (Mute, Black and
Black-necked) and many other birds. There are so many Swans that
pairs do not try to establish a sizeable territory, nor to fight badly. But
broods with their parents are removed as soon as they hatch into breeding
pens, where they are reared. It seems to work perfectly. I also noticed
big broods of Orinoco Geese, and other waterfowl. There are two big
buildings, with partly open roofs. Groups of Cracids occupy one, water
birds the other. Several species of Curassows and Guans are there,
including a pair of the very rare Penelope ochrogaster. It is all roomy, well
designed and decorated.
Several very large flights, some still under construction, are situated
in a wooded ravine, scattered along a winding path and surrounded by
beautiful tropical plants and shrubbery. The aviaries themselves are
artistically planted and adorned with rocks and logs. Many gamebirds,

including four forms of Whistling Guans, Tinamous and other big birds
live and breed in them, and it all looks very pretty. There are other
houses and aviaries for smaller birds, of which a very good collection has
been assembled, but I particularly want to mention the Hummingbird
exhibit. It consists of a very large, walk-in aviary ioo ft. x 50 ft. x 30 ft.,
very well and lightly built of steel. As you enter it, you walk across a
beautifully laid out garden, with rocks, streams, trees and tender plants.
Some 400 Hummingbirds live in it and can be seen here and there as you
progress. The flight is so roomy that they can escape each other's attacks.
It is a wonderful sight.
All these accommodations are a great credit to Dr. and Mrs. M. P.
Autuori, the Director and his wife. Mrs. Autuori has the particular
charge of the birds and is responsible for the excellent design of the
aviaries. They both should be highly congratulated, and also praised for
the excellent laboratories which have been organized for research of
various sorts. The Sao Paulo Zoological Park certainly counts as one of
the progressive institutions in the world, unique in South America.

Having heard that Snowy Owls do not reproduce until they reach the
age of three, it seems to me right to notify what happened to a pair of
such birds I had bought at the Zoo of Basilea.
Towards the end of the summer 1967, I obtained a pair of Snowy Owls
born in the spring of the same year. They were so healthy and strong
that in the spring of 1968, they laid seven eggs. One of them got broken,
five were sterile, and one gave birth to a chick which, once grown, proved
to be a female.
This year, 1969, when they reached the age of two, they laid six eggs,
all fertile. One chick could not be found any more a few days after
hatching. Probably its brothers ate it. The other five Snowy Owls
have grown normally.

picked up some eggs on this farm at South Creake because the nest was
amongst sugar beet which was being hand-hoed. These eggs were
already partly incubated and I had them in an incubator for about 14 days
before two hatched. One lived until the winter of 1965. I have not got
any proper wintering quarters and these appear essential. My interest is
really restricted to water fowl, and I have about 80 varieties, kept in
approximately five acres of pens. The Stone Curlews proved a very

Last year I gave prominence to the fact that Dr. Alan Lendon had bred
a Slender-billed Cockatoo, in the belief that possibly it had not been bred
previously. In this I was, of course, very wrong. I am painfully sur-
prised at this lapse. I am also surprised that only one member, Thomas
Brosset, Gothenburg, pointed out that not only had there been a breeding
account by Kenton C. Lint, with a photograph of a young one reared in
the San Diego Zoo, in 1959 (1959, 107), but that I had referred to this
and another success in my notes (1967, 21). On this occasion Homer
nodded with a vengeance!

September and by the 3rd had three eggs, both birds incubated. On the
14th I heard young calling. They fed the young well but I did not hear
any more calling until the 28th. On 8th and 9th October a young one
was sitting in the nest hole and it fledged next day. It is now at the Rode
Tropical Bird Gardens. The adults have now moulted and are full-
winged. They appear to be very hardy but still sleep in the nest-box."

In the Los Angeles Times , 10th November, 1969, an article on attempts
to save the Whooping Crane by breeding it in captivity at the Patuxent
Wildlife Research Center stated that the Center's Assistant Director for
Endangered Wildlife Research, Dr. Ray Erickson, was insulted that the
Audubon Society should have referred to him as an aviculturalist (sic).
He is quoted as saying: " I am not an aviculturalist. An aviculturalist is
a zoo keeper. I'm a scientist, a biologist." This is a little narrow in
view of Colin Harrison's definition of aviculture which was published in
L the Magazine (1967, 178). We feel that Dr. Erickson should remember
; that it was the efforts of men in many walks of life who were not zoo
keepers, but were proud to call themselves " aviculturists ", that created
both the background of knowledge and the climate of favourable opinion
that made his present conservation work possible.

It is pleasing to learn that John Wilson has a Pesquet's Parrot
Psittrichas fulgidus. Since Lesson described and named this parrot
Psittacus pecquetii in 1831, there have been only about a dozen living
specimens in this country.
It has often been said that the first known living bird was in the Earl
of Derby's collection at Knowsley Hall. This assertion is probably
based on Lear's colour plate in the parrot volume of Jardine's Naturalist&apos;s
Library (1836). Like many present-day artists, Lear preferred to paint
from living birds, and so it is presumably assumed that the bird depicted
was living. But it is more likely that the model was, in fact, a specimen
in Lord Derby's museum.
There can really be little doubt that the first live Pesquet's Parrot, a
female, was owned by the Marquess of Tavistock in 1918. After being
in his possession for a couple of years it passed to Mrs. M. Dalton-Burgess.
It died in 1924, in which year Mrs. Dalton-Burgess acquired a pair.
Wilfrid Frost imported one in August 1921; after a short stay at the &apos;
London Zoo it continued its journey to America. In October, 1926,
W alter Goodfellow brought two for J. Spedan Lewis--one of which he
presented to the London Zoo. Then in August, 1927, Walter Goodfellow
brought a pair for Herbert Whitley. One died before Christmas: the
other was his National Show winner that died in February, 1928. And
there was a female living in the London Zoo in 1936. I believe I saw all
of these, with the exception of Lord Tavistock's original bird. The
majority seem to have been rather short-lived. It is to be hoped that
John Wfilson's bird will fare better.
Incidentally, who was the Pesquet later to have this parrot named in
his honour? In old specific names authors have variously named him

BIRDS OF PARADISE AND BOWER BIRDS. By E. Thomas
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999192829268293" page_id="58076125"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
Gilliard. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1969. Price 6 gns.
Unfortunately very few aviculturists have the opportunity of obtaining
live specimens of these gorgeous birds; the appropriately named Birds of
Paradise, unsurpassed in their beauty and bizarre ceremonial dances, and
the Bower Birds with their extraordinary display grounds, one of the
strangest and least understood phenomenon in nature. These birds are
now very strictly protected in their native New Guinea and a few adjoining
islands, yet the annual killing of more than 80,000 males--mostly of only
three species--did not threaten any of the birds of paradise and the author
advocates that small numbers of the live birds might be collected each
year and exported to zoos and similar institutions, to be used for educational
purposes.
The author, accompanied by his wife, an ardent naturalist, made five
expeditions to some of the wildest parts of New Guinea and brought back
a wealth of information regarding the habits of these little known birds.
He advances the theory that the paradise and bower bird groups are derived
from a single colonization of New Guinea, first arboreal monogamous
birds which subsequently became polygymous and then diverged into
birds of paradise and bower birds and reverted to monogamy.
The evolution of bower building is so remarkable that one naturalist
has suggested that birds should be split into two categories, bower
birds and all other birds. The males of some species build elaborate
walled bowers of sticks and decorate them with bright objects and even
with paint. Others construct towers up to nine feet high, some with
tepee-like roofs and internal chambers situated on circular lawns that
they tend carefully and embellish with golden resins, garishly coloured
berries, irridescent insect skeletons and fresh flowers replaced as they
 |wither. These bowers are stages on which the males perform intricate
routines of sexual display and mate with the females of their species.
There are only 18 species called bowerbirds, all confined to New Guinea
and adjoining territory but there are in all some 85 species described as
arena birds with a worldwide distribution. The bower birds are con-
sidered to be at the pinnacle of area evolution and have gone a step beyond
the most richly ornamented arena birds, substituting fancy houses and
jewellery for colourful plumage.
The birds of paradise on the other hand have developed most spectacular
varieties of plumage, both in colour and form, combined with characteristic
display performances. These are described in detail, when known,
; together with the breeding behaviour and other observations on the
[ various species, including their distribution. Most of the species are
illustrated by photographs or sketches the majority by the author. There

is also a useful list of ornithological explorations in the New Guinea and
Moluccan Regions and a bibliography.
There are three appendices, one giving a list of ornithological explora-
tions in the New Guinea and Moluccan Regions and another the account
of a visit to Little Tobago in 1958 where Sir William Ingram, founder of
the Illustrated London News, succeeded in placing 44 Greater Birds of
Paradise in 1909. It was estimated that by 1958 there were probably
less than 35 birds of paradise on the island but some were third generation
birds. Recently (1964) a hurricane is reported to have driven some of
these birds of paradise on to Tobago Island.
It is sad to have to record that the author died of a heart attack in New
York in 1965 while the manuscript of this volume was in the editor's
hands. E. H.
AUSTRALIAN PARROTS. By Joseph M. Forshaw. Melbourne:
Lansdowne Press (distributed in the U.K. by Witherby: London)
1969. Price #13 10s.
With the enormous interest in the Australian parrot species and with
the lack of an adequate recent work covering the whole group, this present
book comes as a welcome and much-needed work consolidating the
increasing but scattered information on the subject. Solid would seem
to be an appropriate term since it measures 12 x 10x2 in. and registers
6 f lb. on the kitchen scales. The book covers all the Australian parrot
species, including the Red-fronted Parrot and Kaka by virtue of their
occurrence, now or in the past, on Norfolk Island. Mr. Forshaw has
adopted a classification which recognizes three parrot familes in Australia.
This seems to be an upgrading of taxonomic subdivisions, of a type to
which specialists are particularly prone since they are more conscious of
the diversity of the group which they are studying, and may not recognize
its relative unity when compared with other groups. There are some
interesting regroupings. The Cockatiel is recognized as a cockatoo, the
Galah (Roseate Cockatoo to non-Australians) separated in the monotypic
genus Eolophus, and Bourke's Parrot (they are called Parrots in this book,
which might help us to do away with that unfortunate term " parrot-like ")
is regarded as a dry-country Neophema species that has lost its green
colour, and it is placed in that genus.
The introduction discusses the habitat and has six pages of habitat
photographs. It also discusses distribution in general, but Spencer's
classic concept of three zoogeographical sub-regions, shown on a map,
is probably obsolete since Keast has shown the situation to be much more
complex. 1 here is also an introduction to the text layout, and a short
introductory section on keeping parrots in aviaries.

The main bulk of the text is devoted to individual species. These are
arranged in a systematic sequence. Each family, subfamily and genus
is introduced by a brief indication of their special features. Each species
has about three pages of text devoted to it, accompanied by a small map
of distribution and one, or in some cases two, full-page colour plates.
These plates are mostly close-up photographs of single birds, or more
rarely of pairs. These are fine detailed studio-type portraits, but I must
admit that I appreciated the occasional photograph from the natural
habitat, especially one of a Galah drinking, and I felt that some of the
size might have been sacrificed to include a picture of the plumage of the
young, or in some cases of the female which was not always included.
A few of the plates show evidence of poor colour values. Apart from the
transposed pictures of the two lorikeets, mentioned by the publishers,
there is another eiror in that the picture of the Twenty-eight Parrot is
not in fact that of the race sernitorquatus , but a bird in mixed plumage,
probably from one of the areas in South-west Australia where the two
forms are interbreeding. The five paintings of J. C. Yrizarry illustrate
those species for which photographs are not available.
The great value of the text lies in the incorporation of up-to-date
information. A description of the adults of both species is given, but
the immatures are dismissed rather summarily. The distribution is
summarized in the text in addition to being shown on a map. The
various subspecies, where these exist, are described, and the ranges given.
The type of country occupied in various parts of the species range is
summarized under habitats, and a paragraph is devoted to its status, in
terms of abundance, within its range. The section on habits contains
information on the general behaviour, and in the more adequately studied
species summarizes the normal daily routine. In a few instances it
indicates the paucity of the data available. A section on movements is
particularly necessary on a continent where variable drought conditions
may cause many species to show seasonal or periodic movements within
their range, and allowance must be made for such movements when
evaluating a map of the overall distribution of a species.
The description of flight characters and voice are given, although these
are probably of greater value to the field observer than to the aviculturist.
The sections on feeding give information, mostly qualitative, on the food
taken; identifying many of the foodplants and indicating the variety of
the diet; combining both field observations and the examination of
stomach contents. In discussing breeding the displays are briefly
described and data on the nest, eggs, and behaviour during the breeding
period, and development of the young is given for each species. There
is a final short section on the keeping and breeding of the species under
aviary conditions, and the known hybrids are listed.
There is a useful bibliography at the end of the book, but there is no
indication of the fact that it is limited to the publications referred to in

the text. It might have been made more useful to the user if it had
included a fuller list of at least the major publications on the Australian
parrots. The inclusion of a gazetteer is another helpful feature.
This is a very useful work and one that most aviculturists will want to
possess. In the circumstances the very high price is unfortunate. The
reviewer was interested to see a recent review in an Australian ornitholo-
gical journal of Immelmann's book on Australian parakeets. This costs
#2 and the reviewer commented that at this price only the most enthusiastic
parrot-lover would want to buy it. One wonders what he would have
said about the present work! Another cause for complaint is that the
large colour plates are stuck in individually on the back of pages of text,
being stuck along the top edge only. Users will find that as the book is
opened and closed the lower inner corners of the plates become bent in
and will have to be glued down if the book is not to acquire a dog-eared
appearance. Also the book is far thicker at the middle than at the edges
and is therefore difficult to handle, and if used frequently the binding at
the spine begins to show signs of strain. The layout of the text is lavish,
with plenty of spaces, and the section headings and maps considerably
reduce the amount of text on a page. One wonders whether with some
economies, and with something less of a coffee-table book as the ideal,
the publishers might not have produced a more reasonably-priced work
which would have reached more readers; and the last point is the crucial
one, for in the long run the value of a book must be judged to a large
extent by its availability to a large number of readers. In spite of such
criticisms it is still a work to be recommended, not only to aviculturists
but also to ornithologists in general and to the non-specialist bird-lover.

Birds). By H. Dost. Published by Verlag Eugen Ulmer of
Stuttgart, Germany, 1969. Price D.M.q-So.
Th is excellent little book is one of series on animals (Ulmers Tier-
buchreihe). It deals with a very large number of birds, including
representatives from different families, that are commonly, or not-so-
commonly, kept in captivity. Many species of starlings, babblers, finches,
buntings, cardinals, flycatchers, thrushes, weavers, whydahs, tanagers,
etc., are dealt with and 72 of them are illustrated in colour.
The illustrations are adequate rather than superlative in quality but it
is nice to have so many of them. Some of the species chosen, such as the
Corsican Nuthatch Sitta whiteheadi , are hardly likely to flood the bird
markets in the foreseeable future (at least, I hope not). They have,
presumably, been chosen because there was much useful information
available on their behaviour and needs in captivity and this seems to me a
justifiable reason for including them.

Each species is dealt with concisely but in some detail. General
information likely to be of use to the aviculturist is followed by dis-
tribution; description, with age and sex differences; voice; care needed in
captivity; food; and breeding. A really good feature is that full references
are given (cited in text and details at back of book) to accounts of successful
breeding, studies on the species in captivity and so on.
I assume that the waxbills and other estrildines are likely to be dealt
with in a separate volume in this series. Otherwise their complete
omission, except where some of them are named as hosts of the parasitic
Whydahs, would be unaccountable.
A minor defect of the book is that the index is not in alphabetical order,
the birds being listed in the same order as in the book, which rather
negates its purpose. All the same this is an interesting and useful book
that can be recommended to all who read German. D. G.

This is another volume in the same series as the book reviewed above.
In my opinion it is a better one, perhaps I should say an even better one.
It differs by including much information about the ecology and habits of
parrots in a wild state. I hasten to add that I use the word " parrots ",
as does the author, to include all psittacines--lories, lorikeets, lovebirds,
typical parrots, parrakeets, cockatoos, the lot! (It is to be hoped,
incidently, that parrot-keepers will sooner or later come to their senses
and use the word " parrot " as one uses " finch ", " pigeon ", " bunting "
and so on, and drop the misleading and cumbrous " parrot-like " at
present in vogue.)
To get back to my job of reviewing this useful and attractive little book.
Like its companion volume it contains concise but quite comprehensive
information about each species and how to keep and breed it, where such
information is known. Unlike the first book, however, it does have an
easy alphabetical index to both common and scientific names.
It is illustrated with many photographs of living birds, ten of them in
colour. There is a colour plate showing the identifying head and forepart
colour patterns of 18 species of Amazon parrots. The publisher's
blurb on the back cover is painfully " twee " but it is most emphatically
not a sample of what is between the covers, which can be heartily recom-
mended to all who read German and are interested in parrots (psittacines).

MEAT AND PROTEIN FOOD FOR PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954562016949153" page_id="58076130"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
In view of some of the points raised in Mr. Smith's letter below, we have asked
one or two other aviculturists for their experiences and will be glad to hear ifiom
others regarding the use of meat and insects as food for parrots. My own experi-
ence with a Little Corella was that it liked roots and root vegetables best; and if not
carefully watched would climb up at meal times and gaily throw the meat off a
plate to get at the vegetables; but once its vegetable wants were satisfied it would
spend a little time delicately picking scraps of cooked meat from bones. The
recently published book on Australian Parrots by J. M. Forshaw gives some
references which relate to some of the points raised. The eating of wood-boring
grubs by Black Cockatoos is described, and reference is made to masses of pollen
in the stomach of a Purple-crowned Lorikeet, and to the eating of entire flowers
by Barrabands' Parakeet (which Forshaw calls the Superb Parrot), and by the
Red-capped Parrot.
14 Dawlish Avenue, C. J. O. Harrison.
Perivale, Middlesex.
I often get for postmortem various parrots that sometimes between their demise
and my receipt have obviously been eaten by something or other. Even budgeri-
gars, from well-inhabited flights, almost always have the exposed limbs " chewed
down to the bone " and possibly the head and some of the chest nibbled. I keep
Cyanoramphine parrakeets, and to me they are the most tractable of any psittacine
species. They may bicker; but a threat is as good as a fight and it is seldom if
ever that even a feather is lost when a hint to move away from a claimed nest-box
isn't taken. The humorous quote originating from Canon Dutton, concerning
three New Zealand hen parrakeets who, to avoid spoiling a good friendship through
jealousy, combined together and killed and ate the single cock provided, has
always had me puzzled. Birds do differ such that no one can generalize about any
species; but a Cyanoramphus male's beak would have been twice as large as a
female's and, like birds of prey, this parrot genus has the hens one-third as small
again as their spouses. One often hears of murder and cannibalism in other sorts
of parrots, and I have always thought that Canon Dutton's New Zealand hens
were grossly maligned.
New Zealand parakeets or, to be more specific, those two that inhabit the near-
Antarctic Antipodes and used to inhabit Macquarie Island are always stated to
eat a considerable quantity of dead penguin and seal-flesh. Keas, some at least,
seem to have taken to eating mutton live as well as dead. In captivity most parrots
and parrakeets will eat mealworms or maggots. The Keston Bird Farm used to
give boiled cod to their larger breeding parrots, and Black Cockatoos of the
Calyptorhynchus genus are reputed to eat the larvae of wood-boring beetles, while
doubtless there are other carnivorous tendencies in Psittacines.
What I have found most interesting in these early Avicultural Society magazines
are the references to meat-eating in this family of birds. In volume 2 of the first
series, in a letter, Mr. C. P. Arthur notes that Pennants, Crimson-wings, Kings,
Rosellas and Mealies all avidly took chopped fresh meat intended for a Jay that
shared their aviary. Most interestedly he then goes on to say that Grand Eclectus
Parrots are very fond of mice. Each of his specimens consuming two a day, when
he could procure them! In volume 8, again of the first series, Mr. T. B. Whytehead
writes to tell of a cockatiel, that least malevolent of parrots, which ate the head
off a mouse that it had, presumably, caught in its cage.
The diets of wild parrots are not well understood. I know that crop analysis
has been undertaken; but seeds are shelled and other, softer, matter is well masti-
cated. Do Lories for example eat the insects that must be as attracted to the
honey-bearing trees as the birds are? Nectar is not a sufficient complete diet--
it is, after all only a solution of sucrose, glucose and/or fructose. Or do Lories
digest the pollen as well--like bees (Bees feed the larvae on pollen, honey is only
used to supply energy to the adult bees)? And what do Lorikeets eat when the
trees aren't blooming? I have seen Platycercines, in an aviary, chewing away on
an earthworm like a child with a " liquorice bootlace "; is this normal or abnormal
behaviour? Sidney Porter writing somewhere in the magazine said that with a
large collection of diverse, extremely rare, Amazons when these were fed on a

" natural diet " of fruit, vegetable and seed they started dying one by one. Yet
when put, partly out of boredom with the birds, into small cages and fed on seed
they stopped dying off. My own assumption would be that perhaps by then
he had " naturally selected " &apos;and that what he had really shown was " survival
of the fittest ". In these early magazines, and for some later, should a bird die
or start feather-plucking, the food is immediately blamed be it sunflower, safflower
or hemp. And this blame becomes a correct diagnosis and woe betide anyone
who feeds birds differently from the author of the article. I wish that I had such
self-assurance in any of my diagnoses as to aetiology.
158 Broadway, G. A. Smith.

There have been many discussions concerning the allegedly harmful effects of
feeding meat to parrots. Over the past ten years or so I have given my African
Grey Parrots a meaty bone for their supper, with no harmful effects, but on the
contrary they have yearly produced fine healthy youngsters.
I obtain from my butcher lamb neck-bones, that have been boned from the
upper shoulder. There is not a lot of meat on them but the birds pick them clean.
I obtain these from my butcher once a week, when the boning is done, and chop
them into small pieces which the birds can handle comfortably. These are cooked
slowly for two hours in the oven in order to extract all the fat. I am quite convinced
that any harm that birds suffer from meat eating is because of the fat in the meat.
I keep the cooked bones in the refrigerator and each day those that are used are
warmed in the oven, since the birds much prefer a warm bone to a cold one.
When there are babies in the nest, and they smell the appetizing warm bones,
there is great excitement, the babies demanding to have their share quickly. If
only one pet bird is to be fed, it can be given a lamb chop or cutlet bone left from
the table, but again, no fat! I have seen people give parrots fatty bacon rinds and
other fatty meats, and I am quite convinced that it is for this reason they sometimes
experience trouble. A pet bird may also be given a chicken bone and will crack
the drumstick and relish the marrow. No pork bones should be given as these
are too rich and fatty.
Finally, I cannot stress too often, NO fat !

I understand that Mr. G. Smith has written enquiring about meat and proteins
in the diet of parrots, and perhaps the following notes based on my experiences
mav be of interest to him.
With regard to Lories and Lorikeets I feel that there is no doubt at all that
live food is taken in considerable quantities, and in captivity mealworms are always
sucked dry, and never eaten whole. I do not think live food is essential to these
birds, but it certainly seems beneficial, and having found a satisfactory regimen of
feeding I am unwilling to change.
These are the only birds I keep on a strict diet consisting of Hastings Nectar
diluted with the juice from stewed dates and sultanas, mealworms, and a few grains
of soaked sunflower. I have had a pair of Yellow-backed Lories that have kept in
perfect condition for 11 years. This length of time is not unusual for these birds
which often seem to live to a great age, but I put them on this diet when I found
that they suffered from fits when kept on a more mixed fare. Friends who have
given these birds a wider variety of food seemed to lose their birds, so there was
not much point in trying further. I think that live food is most essential.
With regard to the ordinary parrots, Amazons, etc., there seems such a wide
variety of foods that must be eaten in the wild, and live food of a sort is probably
eaten. The one thing that is certain about wild parrots is that their natural diet
can bear little relationship to the food we give them in captivity. Some parrots
will take mealworms, and others are not interested at all. I always give my birds
nectar and soft food as well as seed, and many, particularly the Blue-headed, prefer
soft food every time. ,
The Australian Parakeets including the Budgerigar are definite live feeders when
given the chance, particularly when rearing, and they will eat a lot of mealworms
then. Budgerigars certainly need to see other birds feeding on them to encourage

them to start, but once they acquire the habit they feed freely on live food. This
habit of the Australian Parakeets taking live food was, I think, confirmed on the
recent collecting expeditions undertaken by the Natural History Museum, South
Kensington.
The habit of the Kea Parrot of New Zealand in reputedly killing sheep for their
kidney fat is frequently quoted, and perhaps I may be pardoned for the following
notes, which, while not strictly speaking of avicultural interest, may warrant some
thought.
As a preamble may I mention that for over 40 years I have been connected with
the Australian and New Zealand wool trade, and in the course of this time I have
met many sheep farmers. Speaking generally this group of people once they get
beyond birds that are harmful to sheep or other forms of agriculture, take little
interest in birds.
A few years ago I was connected with a group of farmers who ran sheep in the
high country where Keas are found, and I never met one who had himself lost
sheep through these birds, or had actually seen a Kea attack one. All knew the
story and it was always " Old Jim " or " Old Harry " who had supposedly lost
sheep by this means. Eye-witnesses were, to me, non-existant. This does not
necessarily prove that the stories are unfounded, but I think that they may well
prove to be widely exaggerated.
It may be of interest if I give the results of my enquiries.
Until the introduction of pigs by Captain Cook in New Zealand, there were no
mammals there apart I believe from a few mice, and the Maoris who did not
settle in Kea country in any numbers. Prior to the arrival of the Maoris there
were a race of people there called Moa Hunters, but nobody seems to know
anything much about them. At any rate it seems more or less certain that there
were no mammals in New Zealand until comparatively recent times. The native
bush was therefore almost exclusively spread by means of birds, wind and insects.
It was the solid pathless masses of bush that made the first settlers fear it so, and
burn it off wherever possible. The Kea country was probably first put under
sheep about 120 years ago.
Keas are highly intelligent birds, physically very tough, and equipped with a
powerful beak. They also have a great sense of fun. One friend of mine used to
go and visit a relative who was working on the marvellous fiord road near Milford
Sound. The men were housed in wooden huts with corrugated iron roofs and
snow fell frequently. At dawn the camp was awakened by the Keas who flew down
to the ridge of the roof, and then slid down the slope for all the world like otters
or children.
The late Sydney Porter, who had a pair of these birds in an aviary with a running
stream spanned by a bridge found that the Keas dropped a tin in upstream, and
then ran across the bridge to see it come out the other side. That Keas are highly
mischievous is also true. If the hotels now opening in that area leave the windows
open and unguarded, Keas will get in and rip the place to pieces. The above
notes on the Keas' mental make-up are important. I have always thought that
parrots, dogs and small children have a lot in common in what they find of interest.
That much of this is concerned with minor destruction is also a fact. I do not
know if we will ever see a parrot " Demo "--probably the activities of University
Students are a little beyond them!
I understand that the high country where Keas are found was first stocked with
Merino sheep from Australia, and the snow experience of these sheep would be
slight or non-existent. This is another point that gives a clue to the whole puzzling
business. The most likely explanation I heard was from a farmer who in the slump
of the 1930s was forced to work as a shepherd in very high rough country--too
rough to muster the sheep on horseback. All the work had to be done on foot.
Incidentally he earned 30 shillings a week for this gruelling work, which does not
seem much by present-day standards for this lonely and hazardous work. Many
sheep became bogged down in snow drifts, and unless the shepherd or his dogs
found them, which was not very likely, they died. This farmer suggested, and he
had no great natural history knowledge, that it was probably the struggling and
bleating of these sheep that brought the Keas down. Anyone who has kept mixed
collections of birds has seen how something unusual, a frog or a mouse will bring
all the birds down to look at it and the same thing applies if a bird catches itself
up anywhere in an aviary. Parrots particularly are very prone to attack anything
in difficulties.

We therefore corne to a situation where an alert active bird sees something of
which it has no race experience at all, struggling and crying in a snowdrift. ^ What
is more natural than that the Keas should come down, and, if they found that the
strange object was harmless, should give it a hefty bite? The long powerful beak
of a Kea would rip a sheepskin easily enough. I do not know if the bit about the
kidnev fat is factual, or is just a trimming. Thereds another theory that the birds
were first brought down to the drying frames where the skins of slaughtered sheep
were hung before shipment, but if this was the case I should think that it must
have been flies that they were after. The country lived in by the Keas is heavily
stocked with deer, but I have never heard of an attack on these animals. I suggest
that deer being more accustomed to snow do not often get bogged in snowdrifts.
I managed to get a friend of mine interested in the problem, and he arranged
a trip to try to get some facts. As he knew most of the station owners personally
it would have been a good test but unfortunately he died before he could undertake
the journey. Surely we have members in New Zealand who could track down this
fascinating story, and there must have been some research done on what has
become one of the main legends of ornithology. I may be wrong but I have a
feeling that this is a classic case of where an incident has been buil t up into a legend.
I mav be wrong and the Keas may live on sheeps' kidney fat, but if 1 know
anything of New Zealand sheep farmers, if there had been very much truth in
the story the Kea would have followed so many other New Zealand birds into
extinction before the turn of the century. ,
This story apparently started about the i860--70s and it is as well to look at the
background of the whole thing. The South Island of New Zealand, or at any rate
the southern part of it, was colonized by Scots, men who in their native land had
had to cope with the attacks of eagles and foxes on their flocks. New Zealand
possessed neither of these, so any further predation was unduly obvious, it is
hard these days to realize the absolute isolation of these mountain sheep stations
in the early days. They are hard enough to travel in now but before the country
was widely settled the loneliness must have been frightening. I he absence of
any wild animal or other human for many miles must have led to much family
talk over firesides and ideas must have become a matter of folklore, much as it was
in the Scottish Highlands. The general opinion nowadays of the Victorian woman
is of a frail fainting creature. This may have been the case with those in England,
but anyone who thinks that the women who opened up the country m Australia
and New Zealand, South Africa or South America were of that type would be well
advised to think again. One of the greatest hardships was lack of news or indeed
anything to think of but their daily hard round. The men always had things to
do away from the Station, but the women were literally tied down. Any story,
true or&apos;false was passed on, and in the absence of any firm news such stories as
that of the Kea w r ere passed into folklore. If anybody can add to the foregoing,
I shall be pleased to hear. . , , , . . ^ , __
While on the subject of New Zealand birds, I would mention that a colleague
of mine made a detailed tour of New Zealand Sheep Stations recently and in the
course of this journey stayed at a Station in the South-East of the North Island
named Huiarau. This is an old established station, and is named after the Huia
bird The name is pronounced hoo-yah. The Huia is, I believe, extinct or
nearly so, but its main claim to fame is that the birds possessed long ivory coloured
beaks that of the cock being shorter and heavier for chopping open old logs, and
the hen having a longer probing bill. The bird is about 19 in. long.
The bird was apparently shot out as no Maori considered himself well dressed
without a Huia beak hanging on his watch chain. There is a rather curious
parallel here with the Ivory Billed Woodpecker of Florida wmch was driven to
near extinction for the same reason. Man has wiped out numerous species of
animals and birds for one reason or another, but these are the only two cases I
know of where birds were driven to extinction by male adornment.

THE NATAL PYGMY KINGFISHER

(Ispidina picta)
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
There are two species of tiny kingfishers in Southern Africa which can be
confused in a casual examination. They are the Malachite kingfisher,
Corythornis cristata (Pallas) and the Pygmy kingfisher, Ispidina picta
(Boddaert).
It is with this latter that we are now concerned, and particularly with
the race natalensis. Briefly the main difference is in a matter of habitat.
The Malachite kingfisher is a bird of the rivers and the environs of open
stretches of water, whilst the Pygmy kingfisher is predominantly a dry-
country bird feeding mostly on grasshoppers, tiny lizards, caterpillars,
beetles and the like, often very far from any water.
Its nest is in the typical hole in some earthy bank, and is in every respect
similar to that of almost any other member of the family, but the site
chosen is more often the side of a termite mound into which the bird
excavates the tunnel, rather than the softer, sandier site of a river bank.
The extra work involved in digging a hole through a hard sun-baked
surface finds its effect in the greater wearing down of the bill, for it is very
noticeable how short the beak of this bird is compared to that of a
Malachite kingfisher In captivity when the bird is relieved of all this
hard work, the beak quickly becomes overgrown and out of character,
despite the lesser work involved in smacking its bill against a perch in order
to stun its food, which kingfishers always do!
There is not much of a white patch on the lower cheek where the
Malachite carries a considerable flash, and the back of the neck is chestnut
where the Malachite is blue-violet. However, there is only an iridiscent
small blue patch below the ear-coverts, whereas the whole of the side of
the Malachite's head above the eye is blue-mauve or violet.
It is on the crown that the main obvious difference is to be seen; for the
Malachite kingfisher erects an extraordinary barred and tipped black
shaped tiara of long emerald green crest-feathers, in moments of excite-
ment. The Pygmy kingfisher wears no such adornment but instead its
crown centre from bill to nape is rich ultramarine blue barred with black.
They are both most beautiful little birds.
The Pygmy kingfisher is much addicted to migrating at night and
frequently is attracted towards lighted windows, where it often either
enters houses, if the windows are open, or breaks its neck against the glass.

D. M. REID-HENRY--THE NATAL PYGMY KINGFISHER
In one case I was told about the bird that flew into an African's house and
was promptly skinned and eaten as part of the man's supper!
In another case the bird was taken alive and unharmed to school by
a small boy who wanted to give it to his nature-study teacher. This lady
brought it along to me in a shoe-box and I agreed to have some decent
accommodation made and look after it.
I would like to describe the cage I had made for this bird in some detail
because it has served me well for several purposes. It was made strongly
so as to serve as a packing case as well as for other purposes. The top,
when it is used as a cage is a fine mosquito mesh of copper wire, whilst
the front is a sliding sheet of plate-glass, going into position from the top.
The door is the side which opens as two wings and which can be screwed
in solidly, or left as a door as required. The rest of the construction is
of oil-bound hardboard on a stout wooden frame. It serves equally
well as a cage for birds or insects, whilst the overall size is enough to give
a lot of room.
The floor I covered with dead leaves and sand and I placed a water
container and the daily ration of live insects, geckoes, etc., inside by
simply lifting the glass front a few inches. Perches were natural branches
which were laid on the floor so that the twigs could stand up in interesting
positions to show off the bird.
In this cage I kept the kingfisher for about six months until it was time
to return to England, when I took him out into the bush and let him go.
Feeding involved a daily stint with a butterfly net in the vlei to catch
grasshoppers. Another stint with the net indoors after sundown brought
me a ready harvest of moths and beetles. I found it astonishing to see
how large an insect this tiny bird could swallow: large moths of the
common sort would be divested of their wings and then swallowed
without difficulty, but there was a danger from large and powerful grass-
hoppers whose enormous kicking power had to be curtailed for fear of the
little bird's losing an eye.
Whilst this bird is as I have said a species of the dry country in the -
main, he was very keen to take several baths a day and was always ready
to retrieve any food from under water, and I believe its dry-country
habitat is a comparatively recent adaptation. There are other kingfishers
in Africa and Asia which behave in exactly the same way.
It is evident that as a family kingfishers are very adaptable to change
in dietary habits, but they have little stamina to withstand cold or the
effects of prolonged fasting.
In general they are peaceable birds and may be kept in company with
other species without danger. I look forward to a time when it will be
possible for me to keep some of the other African species and compare
my notes.
Certainly I have found kingfishers always rewarding in every way and
look back on this particular bird with great pleasure, counting myself

singularly fortunate in having had the opportunity to study such an
interesting bird so closely for so long.
He could stand up and look as thin as the proverbial rake, or he could
sit down and look almost spherical in shape. I never saw him sit on one
foot, and because of their shape and structure-it would not seem possible
to maintain the position for long. Their feet are short and set widely
apart so that it would seem hard to balance the centre of gravity over one
foot. I have kept several kingfishers as opportunity came, and I have
never to my recollection ever observed them to sit other than on both feet,
except to scratch their heads, or to stretch. Another reason why such a
posture would be difficult lies with the structure of the toes. Like all
members of the order Coraciiformes the proximal half of their outer toes
are stuck together with the middle toes in a common sheath and so cannot
be spread out to distribute weight. Hoopoes, by the way, do not have
the same degree of restriction as most other members of the order.
It is a matter of wonder to me that birds with such beautiful plumage
as kingfishers can bring up their young in the squalid conditions of the
nest-hole. All the kingfishers, hoopoes, bee-eaters, rollers and hombills
whose domestic arrangements I have studied are united in their
indifference to filth of the most offensive kind. One would imagine, if in
ignorance of the provision of nature against it, that tiny growing feathers
would become ruined by ordure long before the time came for their
owners to leave the nest, but the truth of the matter is that these birds
retain the spiny sheath in which the feather is encased during growth until
almost the time when they are fully grown. Thus they are wonderfully
preserved from contamination, and the plumage breaks out of the sheath
only when the young birds are nearly ready to leave. They emerge from
the tunnel all with unspoiled feathers and thereafter sit around on perches
near to the tunnel entrance whilst awaiting food from their very industrious
parents.
Unlike the passeiine birds which bring at one visit enough food to
supply morsels to each of their offspring, kingfishers usually can feed
only one youngster at each visit. On the other hand, there is usually much
more substance in one feed to a kingfisher than in one mouthful to a
thrush. Nonetheless, the comings and goings of parents of these birds are
very busy affairs and the industry prodigious, for the number of young in a
brood is high. In the case of the Pygmy kingfisher the brood is, according
to Roberts four to six, but in some other species the number is frequently
eight or even more. As is so often the case there are casualties in the nest,
and not all eggs laid actually hatch. Of those that do, some young get
neglected and die, but the quantity of insects, particularly grasshoppers
consumed by the survivors must be great.
One is disturbed to learn that the use of DDT is on the increase in
various parts of Africa in an attempt to clear areas of harmful insects,
but the damage to beneficial birds may well be a far greater evil in the end.

(Psittacula krameri rnanillensis)
By Dr. L. A. Swaenepoel (Lembeek, Belgium)
Indian Ringnecked Parrakeets, and indeed all the allied species, have
always been great favourites of ours. Most of all, however, our hearts
are sold to the beautiful mutations of Psittacula krameri rnanillensis.
We used to be the very proud owners of a pair of blue Ringnecks, who
gave us three lovely youngsters in 1967 and again in 1968. Last year,
however, the hen went down very early--as she usually did--but only
one egg of the clutch of four was fertile. This hatched on 10th April,
when it was bitterly cold after a deceiving spell of sunny Spring weather.
This youngster died at the age of 10 days. It did not thrive well during
the last two or three days, and I had no opportunity to put it under another
hen. On the other hand, I was loathe to bring the baby in into the trust-
worthy hands of my wife, as I did not wish to wear her out so early in the
year. As a matter of fact, she was put to very good use some months
later, to try her hand at rearing Kings from the egg.
As it was, the old blue Ringneck hen went down a second time. All four
eggs of this most unusual second clutch were fertile, and expectations were
high. On 8th June, the hen was found dead in the nest. The eggs,
due to hatch on 10th June, were tried out under Cockatiels, but unhappily
all were dead in shell.
Post-mortem of the hen showed a huge haemorrhage in the lungs, in
the abdominal cavity and in the crop. Apparently, the right atrium
of the heart had burst. This hen died as the perfect symbol of the
excellent mother: she had been covering the eggs even while her body grew
cold and was discovered in the attitude of brooding.
Bearing in mind that one pair of a certain species--or of a mutation
thereof--is a very poor and hazardous way to success and to build up a
breeding strain, we had paired up several other birds. Two acquired
split blue cocks 1967 were paired up to two of our own bred hens of that
same year. The blue hens seemed a certainty: anyone could easily tell
the more slender bills, the differences in the size and shape of the heads,
the more elegant feet and also a decidedly different hue of the iris. The
behaviour, too (many times observed), pointed the same way: the hens
always sat close to the cocks, and we were delighted to possess such well
behaved and loving young pairs.
Being of a rather impatient nature, I had, on several occasions, plucked
some small feathers in the nape of each one of these four birds, so as to see
if new feathering would show a trace of the black collar of the male.

The green split blue cocks showed some of this male colouring in the
autumn of 1968, but the two blue hens, true to my expectations, grew
back the blue female feathers, even when I plucked their napes in March
1969. I must confess, that I was gradually becoming prouder in my
abilities for sexing immature Ringnecks. The two young pairs did not
visit the provided nests, as we had hoped; still, one must not be too severe
with two-year-old Ringnecks.
However, in the moult of 1969, the two blue hens grew themselves a
lovely black collar; those two simulators have, since then, been two lovely,
lively cocks.
In the meantime, we had built up another pair of blue Ringnecks;
unrelated 1968 birds of our own breeding. The supposed hen of this
young pair eventually suffered from a very bad moult, for which I have
found no explanation; in fact, she went nearly bald in a few months time.
No sign of plucking nor of new growing feathers, in spite of a varied diet
and a supply of vitamins. I found her dead, nearly-naked body hanging
on the wire netting on a cold August morning. Indeed, post-mortem
showed that she was a hen. The remaining 1968 bird that had been
living in the same aviary, looks like a cock though no ring is as yet visible.
Still, I'd not take a bet on him!
Our last pair of this mutation consists of a blue hen with a broken and
partly overgrown lower mandible, probably due to an accident when she
was quite young. Occasionally, we have to catch her in order to clip the
broken part of this lower mandible. She can feed all right and is in good
condition, but apparently she is unable to feed a baby: on two occasions,
she had newly hatched youngsters that died with an empty crop. Her
mate is a green cock split for blue and for lutino; he was loaned to us by a
friend. In 1966 and 1967 this pair were living at our friend's establish-
ment; both years they had fertile eggs which never hatched. On taking
them over to our aviaries, we decided to foster her eggs out with a reliable
pair of normal green Ringnecks, excellent parents, while the blue hen was
able to brood the green's eggs, with no results.
In 1968 we reared from this pair two blue youngsers, the third egg being
infertile. This made it easy to divide the clutch, sticking to the breeding-
terms.
In 1969 this pair had again three eggs, one of which was clear. Upon
hatching under the normal green hen, on 26th April 1969 we noted a
black-eyed and a red-eyed baby. Then the suspense started! Would
the red-eyed baby turn out to be an albino? I wonder if any nest has
ever been so closely surveyed. We had to wait about three weeks,
wondering if the first pin-feathers were going to be white or yellow and,
in the end, hardly believing that they were white, indeed! This albino
baby, a hen of course, grew in a most lovely way; indeed, she has always,
from hatching, been taller and heavier than her green brother (?). Having
heard of the mishap of Mr. Rudkin, when he bred his first specimen of

albino Ringneck in California some years ago, and unwilling to risk its
being killed by the foster-parents, the albino and the green were taken out
of the nest at the age of four weeks, the albino showing a very slight sign
of feather-plucking on the back. My wife hand-reared them nicely.
They are very easy and gentle birds, and hand-rearing was no trouble at
all. It is perhaps interesting to note that the albino when feeding had
the crouching attitude of a female, while her green brother (?) stretched
head and neck to be fed. Weights were respectively 165 gm. (for the
albino) and 140 gm, on 25th May 1969, the day after the babies were taken
into the house. They learned gradually to feed, first in a big cage and
later in an inside aviary, they were then put into an outside aviary where
the lovely tame youngsters turned into rather mistrusting birds.
The albino hen and her green split blue brother (?)--he might be split
for lutino, too--are now out of the country in our friend's collection.
The albino is, of course, not a common bird and, to our knowledge, the
fourth ever bred. Mr. Rudkin had one killed in the nest some years ago
but managed to breed a new one in 1968, I believe. Another one was
previously reared at Keston Bird Farm but was lost after some months.
We hope to breed more of this lovely mutation and eventually to be able
to build up a strain of them. The hen is pure white with red eyes, rosy
beak without any trace of black and chalk-white feet. The cock should
show a black collar, presumably with a rosy lining.
In the meantime we are much in trouble with our blue and split blue
cocks, for which blue partners do not seem available nowadays. We have
written many letters, but to no avail up till now. We are really feeling
rather " blue " about it!

BREEDING THE FIRE-FRONTED BISHOP

For the last three years I have been the happy owner of these small,
beautiful weavers, the Fire-fronted Bishops, Euplectes diademata. The
male in breeding plumage has a reddish-orange forehead, the rest of the
head, neck and underside black, wings blackish with feathers edged with
yellow or buff, the tail ashy and the under-tail coverts golden-yellow.
The bill is black. The female has the typical streaky plumage of a weaver,
streaked buff and black above; throat, upper breast and flanks buff with
some darker buff streaking, and lower breast and belly white. The
primaries show yellow edges. The bill is horn-coloured. The non-
breeding plumage of the male resembles that of the female. In the wilds
this species occurs in a limited area of eastern Kenva and Tanzania.

According to Mackworth-Praed and Grant (Birds of Eastern and North-
eastern Africa, vol. 2 (1955)), the eggs, nest and habits of this species are
undescribed.
In 1968 I discovered a nest containing a single egg in the outdoor
aviary, but I never found out which bird had made it. This outside
aviary measures 4x5x2*510., and the ground inside is covered with
grass except for a third which is covered with a Juniperus chinensis. There
are several branches of elm in it. There is an inside aviary, 2 x 2 x 2-5 m.,
and in addition the birds also have access to a greenhouse, 3 x 1*5 x 2*5 m.
The greenhouse is planted with vines and wildflowers. During the
winter the birds are housed in the inside aviary.
At the end of May 1969 there was another nest, this time containing
two eggs, plain turquoise blue, and I later discovered that the bishops
were the owners. The nest was made of coconut-fibre. The only other
material available to them was the grass and they used a little of this.
At first it was possible to see the eggs easily through the nest, but gradually
more fibres were added, until it was difficult to spot them. During
incubation the male would eagerly follow the female when she was out
of the nest, apparently trying to drive her back again, but she would not
go to the nest in my presence.
At last one young one left the nest. It was similar to the female in
appearance, only a little paler, and with an almost white bill. I estimated
that the incubation took about 14 days and the young left the nest when
about three weeks old. The food consisted of a mixture of seeds and
mealworms. The food available in the aviary was a seed mixture of
many kinds of millets, canary seed, and grass-seed. As they share the
aviary with different fruit-eating species they also had access to fruit and
nectar, but I do not think they used much of this; nor did they appear to
touch the green plants much, but with other birds present it was difficult
to observe the feeding habits. By November it was apparent that the
young one was a male and it was beginning to weave nests, but was still
in juvenile plumage, and at present (January 1970) has not yet moulted
into breeding plumage.

ROSEMARY LOW--THE RED-CAPPED PARROT
THE RED-CAPPED PARROT
(Pionopsitta pileata )
By Rosemary Low (Sidcup, Kent, England)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993712" page_id="58076158"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
At the end of May 1969 I was offered three little parrots, of whose
identity I was at first uncertain, until I remembered a plate in the
Avicultural Magazine for October 1905. On reference to H. Good-
child's beautifully drawn and coloured illustration, I was able to identify
them as Red-capped Parrots Pionopsitta pileata --two males and a female,
I believed. The " female " unfortunately moulted out into a male.
In appearance these parrots are not unlike a large Abyssinian Lovebird,
the male being green, darker above, with the forehead and part of the
crown scarlet, with a little scarlet surrounding the eye. The ear coverts
are very faintly tinged with red. The outer edge of the wing, the pri-
maries, and the tail are tinged with blue. The immature cock has no red
on the head, except the faint tinge on the ear coverts. The adult hen also
lacks the red forehead but may be distinguished from immature birds by a
small area of blue on the forehead, which is not very pronounced. The
total length is only 8 in., the body being rather plump, the tail short and
square.
The London Zoo exhibited this species as long ago as 1877 and sub-
sequently in 1883, and 1894 or 1895. I can trace records of only two
other importations into Britain. In 1904 F. C. Thorpe of Hull imported
several, one of which was exhibited at the Crystal Palace show that year,
gaining a fourth prize. In 1905 there were a pair at London Zoo and a
single male in the possession of Hubert Astley, presumably from this con-
signment of Thorpe's. In 1923 Astley received two pairs and com-
mented (Avicult. Mag., September 1923, page 217) that he believed that
none had been imported since 1905.
I was therefore congratulating myself on having acquired these little
rarities when, two or three weeks later, about 20 more turned up.
Unfortunately, several fanciers who had pairs of these birds lost them
almost at once. I did acquire an adult hen from this consignment, a very
nervous bird unlike the three cocks who are exceedingly steady, but she
died after three months.
A veterinary surgeon and fellow member of the Avicultural Society
kindly carried out a post-mortem on the bird for me and concluded that
death was due to lack of vitamin A, associated with a secondaiy yeast
infection.
It therefore follows that a varied and nutritious diet with added vitamins
is essential. All my birds have " nectar " which is made from half a pint
of hot water to which has been added three teaspoonfuls of honey, two of
rose-hip syrup, one of Cytacon (vitamin B 12 ) and a few drops of ABIDEC

(multivitamin solution). The nectar is eagerly taken by the Red-caps,
also grapes and apple, and any wild or cultivated greenfood in season,
as well as most other fruits which are offered.
They are very fond of spray millet, also peanuts, sunflower and canary
seed but they ignore white millet and hemp. .
They are very sociable little birds, rather like Budgerigars in their
behaviour in that they constantly preen each other and warble in their
soft, inoffensive voices; but, unlike Budgerigars, they are gentle, sweet-
tempered and peaceable. They are therefore quite perfect birds for
keeping as pets. A single young one would undoubtedly quickly become
tame, for they appear to have little fear of people.
I put the three cocks in an outdoor aviary in June, where they seemed
quite happy in all kinds of weather. In November I transferred them
to an eight-foot flight in an outdoor birdroom so that they should have the
benefit of electric light and longer feeding hours. Later in November,
one of them begun to show the same disease symptoms as the hen which
had died--tail pumping and a slight discharge from the nostrils. The
temperature was around 38*F at the time so I brought the bird indoors to a
living-room temperature. It soon recovered and appeared quite normal
but when I returned it to the outdoor birdroom, the tail pumping started
almost immediately.
It would appear that this species is not really hardy so I caught up all
three birds. They have spent the winter indoors and appear very fit
and healthy. A pair in the possession of another fancier also showed
signs of discomfort in cold weather and were brought indoors for the
winter. It therefore seems that these little parrots should not be subjected
to the vagaries and variations of an English winter outdoors.
This species is a native of the forest regions of south-east Brazil and
Paraguay. It is to be hoped that all those fortunate enough to have pairs
in their possession will do their utmost to breed from them, although
I doubt that a single pair would go to nest. Sociable birds such as these
normally need the stimulus of the presence of at least one other pair. It
would be a great shame if last year's consignment proved to be an
isolated one.

(Porphyrio porphyrio)
By D. T. Holyoak (London, England)
The Purple Gallinule is a bird of extensive reed swamps and other dense
vegetation of waterside habitats, and the difficulties of observation of
this species in the wild have prevented studies of its behaviour. A popu-
lation of from seven to nine individual Gallinules is kept with many other
birds in the huge Snowdon Aviary at the London Zoo. These captive
birds live in an open grassy area so that prolonged observations on their
behaviour are readily made. This article summarizes information
obtained by watching them at intervals from January 1969 to February
1970. Most of the observations were made on the grey-headed sub-
species (P. p. poliocephalus), but less detailed observations were made on
the blue-headed, green-backed subspecies (P. p. madagascariensis) kept
in a smaller enclosure. The behaviour of the two subspecies appeared
to be identical.
Purple Gallinules are long-legged, chicken-sized rails, with bluish
plumage, heavy red bill, red frontal shield and reddish legs. The various
subspecies are distributed from Spain, Africa and Asia to Australia and
New Zealand, occurring mainly in extensive reed swamps and other semi-
aquatic habitats, but sometimes in drier areas. Gallinules walk and run
strongly, although their flight is rather weak with trailing legs. They
swim strongly, but apparently only do so when pressed to escape (Falla
et al. 1966, Ali and Ripley 1969).
From the literature they would appear to be social birds, usually seen
in parties or flocks, and Harrison (1970) has given evidence from the same
captive birds as I studied showing that more than two birds are often
involved in single nesting attempts. The captive birds studied appear to *
call less often and less noisily than this species is reported to do in the wild
(Oliver 1955, Mackworth-Praed and Grant 1957, Falla et al. 1966, Ali
and Ripley 1969), probably because social contact is possible in their
open, grassy enclosure with less frequent vocalisations than are needed in
their natural habitats. But for this difference, and certain differences in
their feeding behaviour (see below), there is little reason to suspect that
the behaviour of these birds differs much from that of wild Gallinules.
Maintenance Behaviour
Gallinules use similar behaviour patterns in caring for their plumage
and soft parts to many other water and marsh birds, but they do show
some noteworthy peculiarities. They bathe standing in shallow water,
by making ducking movements of the head in bursts alternating with

bursts of flapping the part-opened wings. Coots ( Fulica atra) and
Moorhens ( Gallinula chloropus ) also bathe when standing with their feet
on the bottom of breast-deep water, resembling the less aquatic Water
Rail ( Rallus aquaticus ), African Black Crake (Limnocorax fiavirostris) and
Tasmanian Native Hen ( Tribonyx mortieri ) in this, but differing from
ducks, grebes and other water birds.
After bathing they leave the water to preen and oil the plumage.
Shaking movements are usually made first, then the bird nibbles its oil
gland, often making rapid drinking movements in short series; then it
systematically applies preen oil to the scapulars, mantle and body feathers,
as it rearranges them. The tips of the part-opened wings are usually
rubbed over the preen gland, apparently to oil these inaccessible parts of
the body (Fig. A). The head is preened by scratching with the foot
(lifted under the closed wing), only the claw of the middle toe being used.
The feet are cleaned by nibbling with the bill, and the bill is wiped (some-
times rubbed) against projections, occasionally scratched with the foot as
in head scratching.
Sun-bathing is commonly performed whenever the weather is at all
bright, especially after bathing and the subsequent bout of oiling and
preening. Sun-bathing Gallinules stand in a peculiar position with the
wings extended, part-closed, on each side of the tail, or twisted downwards,
or in positions intermediate between these (Fig. B). Ali and Ripley
( loc . cit.) note that in India this species often clambers up reeds to sun-
bathe in groups on misty mornings. Sun-bathing is often followed by
preening and oiling of the plumage, even when bathing in water has not
been carried out. Peculiar sun-bathing postures similar to those of
Gallinules are also used by other rails, including Water Rail, Moorhen,
Wood Rail Aramides cajanea and Tasmanian Native Hen (pers. obs. on
captive individuals).

Occasionally I have seen Gallinules sun-bathing while sitting on the
ground, with their legs projecting forwards under the body, all four toes
held apart and pointing forwards, and the wings closed.

Feeding Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99884045" page_id="58076162"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
The literature shows that Purple Gallinules are virtually omnivorous,
eating leaves, stems, seeds, grain, flowers, insects, molluscs, leeches, fish,
carrion, water snakes and a wide variety of other foods (Oliver 1955,
Mountfort 1958, Ali and Ripley 1969, Falla et al. 1966, Dement'ev et al.
1969). Captive birds were seen to take vegetable matter by nibbling
low plants, pulling trailing branches down with the bill, clambering in
bushes, grubbing amongst soil and ground litter, and by lifting submerged
water weed in the bill. After food has been picked up in the bill it is
very often transferred to the feet and manipulated with them. Food is
held in the feet by apposition of the hind toe with the three closed fore-toes
(Fig. C), weed is combed with the fore-toes as it is held dangling from the
bill, and the feet are sometimes used to hold down large food objects
while they are pecked (e.g. fish and carrion meat).
Strijbos (1955) records a Gallinule eating the eggs in two egret nests
in an African heronry, and I watched this species stealing the eggs from
the nest of a pair of medium-sized captive babblers. The Gallinules
clambered through the outer branches of a thick laurel bush to reach this
nest, ignoring attacks and noisy threats from the parent babblers;
eventually one Gallinule forced its way through the branches to reach the
nest, and ate both of the two eggs which were in it.

Captive Gallinules persistently use the feet to hold food when they
are nibbling it, often " wasting time " transferring food from the bill
to the feet which could have been swallowed directly. Rowley (1968)
records the use of the feet when feeding on small figs picked from the
ground, but suggests that this is a special adaptation to fig eating.
However, use of the feet in feeding is probably of great importance to
Gallinules feeding in their natural reed-swamp habitats, both in enabling
them to feed from weed held above the surface of shallow water, and to
feed on stems and seed heads pulled down with the bill. The behaviour
has probably been retained in captivity only because it is an inherent
part of their feeding behaviour, not because it is useful in these highly
modified conditions. Young Gallinules attempt to hold food in their
feet from when they are about two or three weeks old, and do so success-
fully when they are half to two-thirds grown.
These captive birds obtained flies and other small, winged insects by
picking them from the surface of shallow water, and earthworms and
snails by shovelling aside gravel with the closed bill, pushing stones aside
using the frontal shield. Food of many kinds was often carried in the
bill to water, and washed before it was swallowed.
Tail-Flicking
Purple Gallinules, like many other rails, have white under tail coverts
which contrast strikingly with the darker plumage surrounding them.
The patch formed in this way is used as a signal marking to warn other

birds of the appearance of a potential predator, and it is emphasized by
tail-flicking movements (Fig. D). Tail-flicking and other behaviour also
functions in territorial (aggressive) display (as in the Moorhen, Howard
1940), and probably in providing a following signal for the young when
the birds are moving through thick cover. Tail-flicking seems to be

performed as a response to anything which frightens the bird. It is
performed indiscriminately whether it happens to be preening, incubating,
bathing, sun-bathing, feeding or resting at the time. Tail-flicking was
also seen from birds which were apparently giving self-assertive display
to drive other birds away. The Moorhen spreads the (larger) white
patch on its under tail coverts in territorial threat, but does not flick its
tail. In this display of the Gallinule the tail-flicking seems likely to have
been derived from the alarm tail-flicking, as fear, excitement, or anger,
could produce this response in both situations.
Calls
As mentioned above, the captive Gallinules studied seemed to be
unusually quiet by comparison with the information given in standard
books, probably because of the lack of cover in this artificial environment.
Falla et al. (1966) list an ear-piercing screech-- kwee-ow ; a draw out,
almost booming poo-koo-koo-koo call; a sighing kwee-nk\ an anxious
pee-ewk ; a bleating kwairk , and an agitated a-yik or k-yik call. The first
of these notes is given as the bird flicks its tail in the territorial calling
posture, and various ga-ga-ga or te-te-te-te calls are given in threat
behaviour (and apparently during sexual display, C. J. O. Harrison pers.
comm.). The vocabulary of this species seems to be highly variable,
and many of the different-sounding calls merge into each other, vary
considerably, or are ambivalent. Thus a detailed study will be needed
to work out their functions more precisely. This variability of the calls
may have an important function in promoting individual recognition in
this social species, where individuals are often out of each others' sight
for long periods amongst vegetation.
From the evidence of sex-identity given by mating behaviour it is
apparent that the calls of female Purple Gallinules are softer and less
harsh than those of males. There is a similar sex difference in the voice of
other rails including the Moorhen (Howard 1940), Tasmanian Native
Hen (Ridpath 1964), Coot (Riippell 1933, Grimeyer 1943) and American .
Coot ( Fulica americana\ Gullion 1952).
Threat and Aggressive Behaviour
As with calls, some of the behaviour postures of Gallinules are ambi-
valent, making it difficult to define their functions. However, unlike the
calls, most of the behavioural postures show little tendency to merge into
one another, so that they would appear to be worthy of record as a basis
for future work. I have been able to distinguish three different postures
used by Gallinules in agonistic encounters. The hunch-backed posture
shown in Fig. E is commonly used in all kinds of aggressive encounters,
especially when two birds meet while feeding. The posture is often only
slightly indicated, but nonetheless sufficient to be noticed by the other
bird and to cause it to respond. At higher intensities the neck is arched

and the head thrust towards the opponent. If the opponent does not
retreat then, it is usually pecked sharply on the neck or the back of the
head, often in short bursts as the victim retreats and its aggressor makes
short (two or three feet) runs after it. Several times I have seen an
attacked bird twist its head away as if to appease when it was attacked in
this way, but its aggressor pecked it regardless, causing the unfortunate
bird to run away. More often when this appeasing behaviour was shown
the threatened bird would be allopreened by the other, and sexual
behaviour frequently followed this.
Another slightly different posture is also used in threat, apparently most
often when the bird concerned is not feeding, but standing close to its
young, mate, or some bird which it considers itself temporarily paired to.
Here the threatening bird reaches forwards without arching the neck,
and makes a more or less prolonged gaping movement at its adversary
(Fig. F). The aggressor's plumage is usually sleeked when this action is
used, and it is frequently aimed at birds of different species and frequently
followed or accompanied by bouts of chasing, again often in bursts of a

few feet each time. I have watched captive birds persistently harrying a
Crowned Crane (Balearica pavonina) in this way, as well as ducks, and
smaller terrestrial birds.
A completely dilferent agonistic posture appears to function mainly
in territory defence. The bird stands upright and flicks its tail to
emphasise the white under tail coverts, while giving loud kree or kree-ik
calls (Fig. G). From their subsequent behaviour it was apparent that
the birds giving this display were males on four occasions. When dis-
playing in this way they will chase off any bird that closely approaches them
on the ground, and this kind of behaviour seemed to cause periodic division
of the Snowdon Aviary population into subgroups with scattered birds,
those birds with the brightest plumage and reddest bills (? males) tending
to be driven furthest.
A display corresponding to, and probably homologous with, the
" swanning " described for the American Coot by Gullion (1952) is
used in response to disturbances near the nest or chicks, or when another
bird intrudes into the nest area. In this display the bird fluffs its plumage
and raises the partly spread wings over the rump (Fig. H).
After aggressive behaviour, and sometimes interspersed with it, violent
pecking at food objects (? redirected aggression), and bill-wiping
(? an " irrelevant activity ") are frequently performed.

Courtship and Sexual Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99817975" page_id="58076166"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
Aggressive behaviour often merges into sexual behaviour. Slight
threat posturing and slight appeasement movements probably occur
whenever two Gallinules approach each other closely away from a nest,
and it is the subsequent behaviour of both birds which determines whether
or not sexual behaviour follows. If courtship behaviour is to follow
when two birds approach each other in this way, they usually either
allopreen (male preens female) or less often pass a small food item between
their bills.

Allopreening is of importance in the preliminary sexual displays, and
probably in maintaining a pair bond when it has formed. In the displays
preceding mating it is always (in my experience) the male bird which
preens the head and neck of the female. The female often appears to
solicit allopreening by turning her head away and fluffing the neck feathers,
and in these circumstances there can be little doubt that the allopreening
is a ritualised activity having little to do with plumage care. Harrison
(1965) discusses the functions of allopreening in birds, and shows that it
has considerable importance in sublimating aggression between birds
when they approach each other closely.
In contrast, allopreening at the nest in the Purple Gallinule is most
often mutual, and other parts of the plumage are usually preened in
addition to the head and neck (except in the " nest changing ceremony ",
see below). It was not at all infrequent to see two captive Gallinules
sitting head to tail on a clutch of eggs, each bird preening the back and
rump feathers of the other. Allopreening of this kind often alternated
with normal preening, and sometimes the oil gland of the other bird was
preened, and preen oil wiped on the feathers of both birds (four separate
series of observations, including more than three different birds). It was
apparent that allopreening of this kind had a significant and definite
function in the care of the plumage, as the movements used appeared
identical (from ranges down to three feet) to those used in normal
preening, and pieces of feather scale were frequently swallowed by the
preening bird.
The passing of small food objects between the bills of birds which
walked towards each other was seen on four different days, and each time
the actions used were very similar to those of a Gallinule feeding a chick.
I have seen this " courtship-feeding " in the pre-breeding period and
during incubation, and C. J. O. Harrison (pers. comm.) has seen it
performed by birds with well grown young. The infrequency of this
behaviour and the small size of the food items suggests that they are only
likely to be of ritual significance, and it is possible that the movements
might be derived from nest building rather than true courtship feeding,
as nest material is often passed from bird to bird at the nest site.
A typical behaviour pattern preceding copulation is that the two birds
approach each other giving slight threat display, then the female " solicits "
allopreening, and is preened on her head and neck by the male. At this
stage either or both birds may start " walking time ", a peculiar action
where the bird walks on the spot, raising its feet without closing the toes
as they usually do when the foot is lifted in walking (Fig. I). The allo-
preening " solicitation " posture of the female may then be exaggerated
into the sexual solicitation posture (Fig. K), and the male may step or
jump on to her back and copulate. The male remains on the hunched
back of the female by clinging with its feet and balancing with flapping
wings (Fig. J), and mating usually lasts for two or three seconds, though

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9818836875" page_id="58076168"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
the male often remains on the female's back for ten seconds or more,
and may attempt to mate several times while standing there. The posture
used by the female Gallinule when soliciting copulation is similar in many
ways to those of the Tasmanian Native Hen (pers. obs.), Moorhen
(Howard 1940), and American Coot (Gullion 1952).
While the female bird is being allopreened other Gallinules (presumed
to be males) may join in and preen on the opposite side, or from near to
the other preening bird. These other birds usually continue with their
preening while the first bird actually copulates, and I have not seen them
make mating attempts of their own. No call is given during copulation,
and the male steps off the female's back and walks away from her, some-
times it then preens, but not always; the female bird usually preens after a
mating attempt.
Breeding
Purple Gallinules build bulky nests of vegetation in the wild, resembling
large nests of the Coot. The nests are generally built in thick cover, and

usually just above shallow water, or up to a few feet above the water
surface (Mountfort 1958, Falla et al. 1966, Ali and Ripley 1969). Both
male and female birds share in bringing material to the nest site, but
much of the material seems to be incorporated into the nest by a female
bird, who receives it from the bill of a male, and perhaps other females.
The captive Gallinules at the London Zoo built nests of grass under or
near such ground vegetation as was available to them, and nest building
activities continue right through the incubation period. Harrison (1970)
has commented on the social nesting of these Gallinules and mentions a
group of four birds which co-operated in the raising of a single brood.
The birds of this group all carried nest material to the sites which were
used for successive breeding attempts, but only one (possibly sometimes
two) of the birds actually incorporated material into the growing nest
structure; the others collected material, then passed it to the bird which
was on or near the nest. During incubation the bird which was sitting
spent considerable amounts of time plucking material from within bill
reach of the nest and incorporating this into the nest walls; it seems
likely that other birds incorporated material into the nest structure in this
way, besides the usual one.
In addition to the group of four birds mentioned by Harrison (1970)
there was also another group of three in the aviary which acted as a social
unit for several months during a nesting attempt, but which was less
cohesive than the other group. At least three birds from the group of
four, and two birds from the group of three helped with incubation, but
I have the impression that the male bird which I most commonly saw
mating did little if any sitting (observations on individually marked birds
are needed to confirm this). All members of both groups took part in
both feeding and brooding their respective groups of young (so far as I
could tell), although the shares of different individuals differed con-
siderably. From the rate at which eggs appeared in three different nests
(one each day for total of six days) it would seem almost certain that each
clutch " was the product of a single female, as other rails lay one egg
per day (Gullion 1954). Incubation periods of approximately 23 and
24 days (plus or minus one day with each clutch) were recorded for
clutches of five and seven eggs from these birds. With each clutch all
j e gg s which were going to hatch probably hatched within about a day of
the first egg, despite the fact that incubation of both clutches probably
started before laying was completed.
Two or sometimes three Gallinules from these groups would sometimes
incubate simultaneously, although most often only a single bird would be
in contact with the eggs at any one time. Changeovers at the nest often
involved little or no ceremony, and they were usually gradual--often one
bird would join the other on the nest, then after a while the first would
walk away. Most often a bird approaching the nest would bring a piece
of grass or other nest material and pass it to the sitting bird, then allopreen

the sitting bird in a very rough and stereotyped-looking way, before
sitting down beside it and trying to move on to the eggs.
With several birds on the nest at once it was not surprising that eggs
were sometimes pushed beyond the confines of the nest rim. When this
happened the eggs were pulled back by deft-looking egg recovery move-
ments. The bill would be hooked over the egg, often slightly shivered,
and the egg would be drawn back towards the sitting bird (Fig. L). At
one nest a single egg rolled down a slope away from the nest and was not
recovered, and the same must frequently happen in nests built in reed
beds.
Fig. L. Egg recovery movement.
These captive Gallinules did not build substantial nest-like structures
in addition to the nest which they used, but separate platforms are built
in reed swamp habitats (Ali and Ripley 1969, Mountfort 1958). These
platforms are used for feeding (Mountfort), and probably for roosting
(as in the Moorhen, Howard 1940). Desultory platform-building
attempts such as the one noted by Harrison (1970) carried out by these
captive Gallinules probably represent expressions of the platform building
behaviour which may be an important part of their activities in reed
swamps. The captive birds were walking on firm terrain for much of
the time, so that there was probably no need to build platforms.
For the first day or so after hatching the young Gallinule chick remains
in the nest and receives little if any food, although it is brooded almost
continually. After this the chicks wander away from the nest and are
brooded and fed by other birds of their particular group. At first the
food was almost invariably pieces of grass bitten off and passed to them in
the bills of the old birds. Sometimes adults were seen to pass food from
bill to bill among themselves (see above) before feeding the young, and
often food would be successively given to and taken from the young.
When the chicks grew larger they were often fed on the food which was
provided in food trays for the adults, including pieces of meat and fruit.
Harrison (1970) suggests that the passing to and fro of food between adult
and chick may serve to break it up for the benefit of the chick. When
young birds are accidentally separated from the adults which are tending

them they give a loud, high-pitched peep-peep-peep call which is inces-
santly repeated until they are given attention. Chicks two weeks old
were beginning to take food for themselves, but young half the size of an
adult were still being fed at times, a month or so later.

By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Cheshire, England)
Growing vegetation is a desirable addition to any compound housing
livestock. In addition to greatly enhancing the surroundings, natural
nesting sites contribute to breeding success. Many plants and suitable
shrubs are recommended in articles on the subject. However, with
aviaries being frequently overpopulated, young plants frequently fail to
become established. Very few bird keepers could tolerate aviaries kept
empty while plants were allowed to make the necessary growth.
It was by chance that the use of Lombardy Poplar trees proved to be
very satisfactory in furnishing planted aviaries. When aviaries were
constructed after the end of the war, poplar trees provided posts to help
overcome the shortage of timber. Four large poplars provided 7 ft.
posts up to 5 in. in diameter. The branches were trimmed from the
posts of poplar, but two or three were left on near the top to act as perches.
The posts were inserted about 18 in. in the soil and supported the wooden
battens on which the roof netting was fixed. A lengthy nail driven
through the batten and into the post top held it in position. It was a
pleasant surprise to find that the poplar posts burst into buds and leaf.
Not only did the poplars act as uprights supporting the roof; they
developed into a dense mass of growth. This required clipping back at
least twice a season, depending on how near the roof netting the plants
were pruned back to. It is most desirable to prevent any shoots from
growing through the netting. After a few seasons with the plants well
established, the task of clipping back the growth near the roof was greatly
alleviated by ring-barking the poplars about 9 in. from the top. Ring-
barking is the removal of a J in. strip of bark round the circumference
of the plant trunk down to the cambium layer. This results in the dying
off of all the plant above the ring, the sap being cut off. In later years
when new stumps of poplar were prepared for planting it was found much
easier to remove all the bark from the top 9 in. thus preventing any
growth. In addition most of the branches were left on, a bush being
formed in the first season. The leaves are smaller in the first year being
normal in size in the second season.
Even in aviaries housing bud-eating Bullfinches, 10 to 12 recently
planted stumps of poplar became established. Where only one or two
were planted they frequently failed to develop, the buds being constantly
pecked by the birds. Roof spans up to 30 ft. were supported entirely by
poplar cuttings. After a period of four to five years a few became
ineffective as roof supports, the top 9 in. having deteriorated as a result
of the barking action. Generally the greater the top circumference of a
cutting the longer it acts as a roof support. Anything under 2 in. in
circumference was not to be relied upon but 4 in. upwards frequently

lasted over 15 years. It is, of course, quite a simple matter to replace
or supplement any plants which deteriorate.
Visitors have inquired about the cut off poplar posts pushing upwards
as they grow. While there is an increase in the circumference, no
upward growth of the trunk takes place. The top 9 in. of barked area
does not develop in any way. Little harm, if any, is done by a few young
shoots growing up through the roof netting. Usually the state of the
nests in the shrubs dictates when they may be clipped back. On some
occasions clipping takes place when birds are sitting without upsetting
the breeding cycle. Where Bullfinches are kept the spring growth of
foliage is retarded by up to a month, while the effect from Greenfinches
is about a fortnight, the birds eating the earlier buds. The Poplar is so
strong in growth that the buds taken by the birds are soon replaced. The
only disadvantage of the retarding of the initial coming into leaf is the
lateness of the provision of natural nesting sites, for the plants do not suffer
any permanent damage. To offset this a few prefabricated nesting sites
are provided in the shelter part of the aviaries, it being considered it is in
the bird s interest to have the early nests under cover. A few evergreen
cuttings, usually laurel because of its availability, are wired into the

leafless Poplar plants to provide cover for early nests. While laurel leaves
hang for over a year in the dead state and provide cover, care must be taken
to prevent leaves falling across a nest. I have records of losses resulting
from a laurel leaf falling on eggs.
Poplar post cuttings inserted 3 ft. apart form a hedge. In one aviary
a pair of Waterhens nested on the top and kept the growth partly under
control by their continuous pecking of the leaves. The same effect
was experienced when the same species nested on top of a privet hedge,
the leaves being removed on top of the hedge several feet from the nest,
resulting in it being unnecessary to clip the hedge all season. Privet
leaves are also taken by members of the pheasant family without any
apparent ill effect. However, any species which chew bark should not
be enclosed in aviaries with privet.
Poplars can be trimmed to provide nesting sites from near ground
level. Sometimes long grasses flourish at the base and being protected
they grow into the poplar foliage thus providing ideal nesting sites for low
nesters such as Yellowhammers.
When the Poplar cuttings have become established the trimming back
results in a dense mass of foliage. When nesting is in progress it is some-
times necessary to view through the growth with the sun on the other side,
in order to detect nests. While a twice a season clipping, plus an early
Spring pruning, keeps the Poplars in good shape, it may be desirable to
resort to more drastic action every 10 years or so. Branches with brush-
like tops can be cut back. The oldest Poplars are over 20 years and
present no trouble to keep them within bounds. Probably restricting the
growth of the foliage effects the root action on the same principle as the
Japanese dwarf culture of trees.
While a Poplar tree may only provide a few trunk-size cuttings suitable
for the dual purpose of roof supports and aviary shrubs, all Poplars offer
cuttings for striking. However, it takes several years for one to two-inch
diameter cuttings to develop heads suitable for natural nesting sites.
The smallest flights here with growing Poplars are only 9 ft. x 3 ft. v
Several flights 12 ft. x 6 ft. have a single plant at one end. Probably
many would not advocate any use of live plants in such small units. It is
a question of the stocking density. Here only one pair of finches occupy
such aviaries. In large units the Poplars planted 3 ft. apart in rows 9 ft.
distant, form continuous hedges with lanes between. It is always
desirable to provide the maximum flying space in aviaries and considera-
tion should be given to the siting of the plants. While a long narrow
aviary gives the inmates a fly-way back and forth the birds must stop
at each end. An aviary which provides unlimited continuous flight would
be of a circular shape, not very practical to construct. Here units
20 ft. x 20 ft. provide finches with continuous flight and units 40 ft. x 40 ft.
serve large parrakeets. Such desirable conditions are most frequently
used by the birds in the early Spring.

It is quite a simple matter to provide live perches from the poplars by
leaving individual branches unpruned. Not only is there no fixing
problem, there is no need to be constantly replacing perches of the con-
ventional type, a task the average bird keeper frequently fails to carry out
properly. In addition fixing perches in aviaries results in the deterioration
of the structure. How often does one observe perches supported by the
ends pushed through the wire netting? The constant action of the birds
alighting wears off the galvanized coating, rust sets in and the wire
fractures.
Where pheasants and other heavy types are kept, perches trained from
poplars are most successful. Being free to yield they do not give sufficient
support and the large birds are discouraged from using them. Branches
cut for perches tend to become damp in wet weather and bone dry in dry
weather, neither condition being normally desirable.

As stated earlier, most aviaries are generally over-stocked and a planted
unit can act as a test. If plants fail to flourish the answer could be too
many birds. In one large unit here there is an annual " battle " between
the gardener and the bird keeper. The aviary in question contains
matured standard fruit trees, mostly apples. It is used as a breeding unit,
being rested during the winter. If the birds, mostly finches, are admitted
before the blossom bursts there is a loss of a ton of fruit. On the other
hand, keeping the birds out of this orchard aviary greatly affects the
season's breeding results. While the actual time of commencing nesting
is not really involved, the birds being accommodated in an adjacent
ioo ft. x 30 ft. planted unit, the best results are obtained when the first
round of young are fed on the fruit buds. The crops of the young finches
are as green and fat as ripe peas in a pod. Fruit trees have two types of
bud, fruit and growth. The fruit buds are plump and develop earlier.
The fruit trees require an annual pruning mainly to prevent shoots from
growing up through the roof netting, 14 ft. high. Poplar cuttings of the
conventional type were inserted 18 in. apart to form a barrier hedge against
visitors wandering through this orchard aviary, keeping them to the walk-
around pathway.
Planted aviaries here are much dryer than unplanted ones, probably
due to root action keeping the soil open. On the other hand planted
aviaries encourage vermin. I will comment on this in a later article
While plants encourage insect life, it is considered a minimal fringe
benefit in average-sized aviaries. Even in large units, rested in Winter,
very little natural insect life is available. In one enclosure a full range of
vegetables is grown, plus soft fruit. It has been found necessary to
introduce blackfly on broad beans, the plants so treated being covered
until the aphis had gained a hold. Three 60 ft. rows of broad and 120 ft.
of runner beans are grown annually, and when infected by black and
green fly give automatic success in breeding species such as Siskins.

In some seasons over ioo birds have been kept in this vegetable garden
aviary, the results and effects providing interesting data.
Non-gardening aviculturists may be deterred from attempting to root
post-sized poplars. The gardening experts advice on rooting poplar
cuttings is somewhat contrary to the procedure which has been repeatedly
proved successful here. The cuttings whether large stumps or small
shoots are inserted in early Spring, not in October or November, although
this latter period is recommended by the experts. The Lombardy
Poplar used here is known as Populus nigra italica } there being 35 different
species of Poplar listed in the Royal Horticultural Society's Dictionary of

Despite the usual frustrations and near-successes last year proved to be a
fairly successful one at the Winged World, as we succeeded in breeding
Southern Tree Pies, Brown-throated Barbets, Yellow-breasted Fruit
Doves, Green Wood-hoopoes, Red-billed Hornbills, Fairy Bluebirds and
Roulrouls. Many others got to the egg or fledgling stage only to be
thwarted, usually by the attentions or close proximity of other birds.
A pair of Little Bee-eaters tunnelled and were later seen taking live food in,
but their tunnel collapsed and was then deserted. Spotted Morning
Warblers made mud nests in several places, couldn't decide which to use
and laid their pale blue eggs all over the place. Hoopoes, Mrs. Wilson's
Tanagers, Andaman Grackles, Abyssinian Ground-Thrushes and
Bleeding-heart Pigeons all got so very near to success also.
Many interesting acquisitions were made during the year. A group
of five Carmine Bee-eaters imported early in June from West Africa are
still thriving at the time of writing, and have been housed in the large
landscaped compartment specially arranged for tunnellers, in which the
Little Bee-eaters made their effort.

Groups of Ferruginous Wood Partridges, Van Den Bock's Pittas,

By D. T. Spilsbury (Malvern Links, Worcestershire, England)
Because Rothschild's Mynah has a limited distribution, being confined
to certain habitat near the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Bali,
the council of the Avicultural Society decided that an annual census and
breeders report should be published in the Avicultural Magazine in
the hope that this would stimulate interest in a captive conservation
programme for the species.
It should be noted that an annual census both for young bred and
numbers held, was, and is conducted by the International Zoo Yearbook
but this is in respect of L. rothschildi held in zoos throughout the world
and does not include the numbers held or bred by private aviculturists.
In 1968 the first census was conducted amongst our members, both
private aviculturists and representatives of zoos, by the late Mr. W. R.
Partridge, and the resulting information together with data assembled by
the International Zoo Yearbook was published in the Avicultural
Magazine, 75 , 3, which was for May-June, 1969. i t i s to be regretted
that Reg Partridge was not able to continue for many years the task he
had set himself and for which his knowledge of this species made him
eminently suitable.
The 1968 census revealed a total captive population for L. rothschildi
of 171 specimens held in 55 separate collections.
In 1969 it was decided to write to all known owners informing them
about the Avicultural Society's census and asking them to complete and
return a census form which in addition to the essential numerical data
sought information about the species in captivity and which when con-
cluded may suggest the best means of persuading L. rothschildi to
reproduce sufficiently to represent a self perpetuating captive population.
This year owners were requested to send information about the age and
origin of their birds, causes of death for both adult and young stock,
longevity, dispersal of surplus stock and also if willing to co-operate in a
ringing scheme. Breeders of L. rothschildi were also asked to answer
questions concerning the housing of breeding pairs, the type of nest box
and nesting material, the number of young reared in 1969 and the prior
years, the success of each pair in terms of nests, eggs per nest and young
hatched per nest, and were the young removed when independent.
W ithin the register will be found the full details of this survey but perhaps
a summary and some further thoughts and conclusions will be more
acceptable to some readers.
There can be little doubt that L. rothschildi is an excellent choice for
the aviculturist to attempt a captive breeding programme with for it is

apparent that adult wild caught stock and more important aviary-bred
specimens, once independent, can and do live for a reasonably long time
which, of course, does mean that breeding pairs can produce young for
several years, T. he longevity record for the species possibly rests with
the birds which Mr. Ezra obtained before the last war and which con-
tinued to live for four or five years after his death in 1956. The

numerous examples within the register for both wild caught and captive-
bred stock of specimens still living with seven, eight and nine years to
their credit.
It is interesting to find that of the 178 specimens held in captivity
71 are captive-bred, 64 wild caught and the remainder are of uncertain
origin. Of the breeding pairs only one pair that was bred in captivity
have so far reproduced and reared their young to independence, and
two other owners having pairs, of which the female is captive-bred,
have produced young. Within the birds of uncertain origin is the
Indonesian total of 21 specimens at Jogjakarta.
It would be impertinent of me, having no specialized veterinary
knowledge, to draw any firm conclusions from the causes of death for
both adult and immature Rothschild's Mynahs but one or two points I
must make. It is clear that not sufficient owners do bother to have their
dead birds examined by skilled avian pathologists, which is a great pity,
particularly in the case of young for here we have the greatest mortality.
The incidence of avian endoparasites is not surprising and deaths directly
attributed to Ascaridia are noted in the register. It would perhaps be wise
for owners to examine faecal samples regularly and take the necessary
steps should ascarids be present. I imagine that in aviaries having a
natural earth floor and particularly on new sites, the gapeworm could be a
problem but so far no repoits indicate that these parasites have caused
death.
There are several instances of mortality due to fighting both amongst
the species itself and from other birds. Incompatability between a pair
either seasonably or permanently must be watched for and if L. rothschildi
is to be kept within a community no risk should be taken with this rare
species by having more aggressive birds as companions.
The production of young that leave the nest or die within it having leg
and other deformities is well known in both this and other insect rearing
species and they are probably due to a calcium deficiency or to a functional
disorder which prevents the absorption of calcium. The large number
of captive-bred specimens that fail to breed and the number of infertile
eggs might also be attributed to the incorrect balance between calcium
and other essentials of the diet. Readers wishing to gain fuller apprecia-
tion of the problem would do well to consult the papers, " Cramps and fits
in carnivorous birds " by J. D. Wallach and G. M. Flieg within Vol. 10,
International Zoo Yearbook.

D. T. SPILSBURY--ROTHSCHILD'S MYNAH, REPORT ON CENSUS 117
All owners were asked if they would be willing to co-operate in a ringing
scheme which would make the permanent identification of all captive
held stock possible. Such a system would be essential if a stud book for
the species is started as indeed it is for any livestock that is to be per-
petuated along prescribed lines over an extended period. In Great
Britain, of the 34 specimens of L. rothschildi at least 12 were bred by
Mrs. Scamell, mostly by one pair, and it would probably not be sensible
to lose the opportunity of identifying these birds permanently before
the knowledge of their origin is lost and unwitting inbreeding to a
dangerous degree occurs. It was proposed that birds should be rung
with split rings and young should be rung when independent of their
parents.
Of the 50 owners who returned their census forms, 32 were in favour
of ringing (Zurich, New York, Philadelphia and San Diego operate their
own schemes), Harewood and Mrs. Scamell would ring young but not
their breeding pairs, two owners would not ring and 14 owners did not
complete the question.
In order to make the census as complete as the available information
allows the following owners either have or recently had L. rothschildi
in their collections and whilst most of them have been contacted none
[1 has made a return. I would be grateful if anyone can give details about
these.

The dispersal of specimens occurred mostly as the result of selling
young but it is good to find that owners having odd birds are attempting
to place them with owners having odd specimens of the opposite sex on
breeding terms, which, of course, is the only intelligent thing to do.
During 1969 Mrs. Scamell, Basle, Zurich, Milwaukee, have been able to
hatch and rear to independence young Rothschild's Mynahs and seven
other owners report egg laying by their pairs. Of these successes Zurich
is surely the highlight for the second generation Rothschild's Mynah this

will wish me to convey to Mr. C. R. Schmidt and the staff responsible our
congratulations on this fine achievement.

11 8 D. T. SPILSBURY--ROTHSCHILD'S MYNAH, REPORT ON CENSUS
Breeding seems to have been achieved under two separate housing
systems, in small flights solely occupied by the breeding pair and in very
large community aviaries where a breeding pair has been able to establish
sufficient breeding territory and monopolize enough of the available live
food to rear young. There seems to be a trend particularly in the U.S.A.
towards the single pair to each aviary method, and I agree that greater
control of the nesting and rearing requirements can be achieved this way.
However, the breeding of insectivorous birds from pairs housed in this
way, with no need to defend the nest and an unlimited supply of food
easily gathered, might account to some extent to the eviction of young
that is so prevalent. Whichever way of breeding is selected it does seem
that the species resents interference when rearing--or at least needs to
feel secure within the nesting area, and I would assume that a planted
flight, perhaps with climbing plants masking the nest, would help to
create the best environment.
It would seem that the species is reasonably catholic in its choice of
nesting site and will utilize twigs, grasses, leaves and many other materials
to line the nest cavity.
The clutch of eggs can number from two to five but three and four seems
to be quite normal. Instances of nesting and egg-laying cycles occurring
six times in a year have been noted, but it is doubtful if more than three
separate successful broods of young could be regularly attained each year
without resorting to fostering out eggs.
It is difficult to ascertain the percentage of hatching in fertile eggs but
one breeder in 1969 found 90% did hatch and I should expect the average
to be better than 50%.
I think on balance it is best to remove the young when independent,
certainly from small breeding units it is essential and probably even in
the large community flights breeding results would have been better had
not young been present.
This year, as occurred in 1968, enthusiastic breeders and owners
suggested that the Avicultural Society should establish an official stud -
book for L. rothschildi. Official in that the studbook would be endorsed
by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources, and the International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens
through the IUCN's Liaison Committee. It has always been my hope
that this will be possible but I do not think that the time has yet come to
embark on an official studbook for two reasons. There are still owners of
L. rothschildi , particularly in Indonesia, who are not yet prepared to
co-operate with us and it is essential that all owners do so, and it is by no
means clear that the species is capable of becoming self-perpetuating
under captive conditions. I must remind you that only four of the 50
owners that returned census forms managed to rear young. The council
of the Avicultural Society will no doubt apply to the Secretary of the Zoo
Liaison Committee to propose the establishment of an official studbook

tained. Meanwhile the Avicultural Society will continue to conduct its
own census and breeders report. In 1970 we shall attempt to establish
the diet for the successful rearing of young and general feeding for the
species, try to determine the best way of sexing Rothschild's Mynah and
continue to seek information concerning mortality for the species.
I would like to express my gratitude to all who completed and returned
their census forms; in this day of bureaucratic spying through form filling,
it must come as a severe blow to find the practice has extended to one's
pastime!
In extending the publicity for the census I wrote a number of articles
and would like to thank the Editor of Cage and Aviary Birds , Mr W S
Page; the Editor of Die Gefiederte Welt , Dr. J. Steinbacher; the Editor of
Foreign Birds , Mr. H. B. Wragg; the Editory of Oryx , Mrs. M. Fitter;
and Dr. and Mrs. L. A. Swaenepoel who edit Le Mond des Oiseaux and
De Vogelwereld , for kindly publishing them.
Mr. Joseph Lucas has again kindly given permission for material
published within the International Zoo Yearbook to be used for this year's
census.

H. Christiansen, 4953 Vistuborg. (A.S.C.)
This breeding pair are father and daughter. ihe
original pair was purchased before 1965 and was wild
caught. Young were hatched in 19651 1966 and 1967*
but were killed by the adult male between 6-13 days.
In 1968 the male was removed from the flight after eggs
were laid and kept out of sight and hearing of the female.
The female reared one youngster to independence (two
hatched but one died at ten days) and this was removed.
The male was returned and the pair bred again out
though young were hatched the female would not feed
them. In the spring of 1969 the male killed the female
and the young hen was placed in an adjoining flight.
Later the young female was allowed to join the adult
male. Two eggs were laid that contained young. The
breeding flight was planted and had dimensions of 2 m.
long, 1*20 m. wide and 2 m. high, the shelter was the
same size. The nest box was 30 cm. wide, 18 cm. high,
at the back, 15 cm. at the front and 15 cm. in depth.
The diameter of the entrance placed at the end of the
front was 10 cm. .

and each pair was housed separately in planted flights
20 x 8 ft. plus shelter io x 8 ft. Nest boxes 15 x 12 x 7^
in. with a square entrance hole z\ x 2^in. and an outside
landing ledge. Nesting material mostly fine twigs and
roots with some grass and feathers. Fresh green
leaves were also found in the nesting cavity. The cause
of death for young is the usual rejection by the parents.
Within 24 hours of hatching the young would be
thrown out the nest. From previous years it has
been found this procedure would continue until late
summer and the last nest of eggs would be hatched and
the young more usually reared. Mr. Hall suggests that
the success comes after the peak in breeding condition is
over. Pair 1 nested three times and pair 2 three times,
the clutch for each pair being usually four eggs but
sometimes three or five. In 1969, whilst the two pairs
were still with Mr. Partridge, an interesting experiment
in the use of foster parents was tried. Three pairs of
common Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris , were housed in a
large flight and allowed to nest at the same time as the
Rothschild's mynahs. Eggs were transferred from the
mynahs to the starlings but rejection of the hatched
young, of both species, took place from the starlings
nests. A second attempt was made and eggs were again
transferred. Just before hatching a panel in the aviary
roof wire netting was removed to allow the starlings to
forage for their own food but two pairs and one male
promptly decamped. The remaining female hatched
two young mynahs and reared them on her own but
never leaving the aviary to do so. One youngster died
just before it left the nest and the other died about a
week after leaving the nest, dietary deficiencies probably
accounting for these losses. In 1969 approximately 90%
of the eggs hatched.
I am grateful to Mrs. A. B. Partridge and to Mr. A. E.
Hall (Mr. Partridge's assistant) for most of this informa-
tion.

the last two years this pair went to nest six times each
year and the clutch was always of three eggs. The nest
box Mr. Marlow describes as being of a small parrot type
20x12x10 in. and small twigs comprised the main
nesting material. It was usual for the male to eat the
eggs at about twelve days but he was removed prior to
this period of incubation on the last occasion, the female
did sit but no young hatched. The male later " went
light " and died.

This breeding pair has reared three in 1965, two in 1966,
three in 1967 and no less than eight in 1968. In 1969 this
pair nested n times laying a total of 12 eggs in four of

This breeding pair nested five times and hatched all five
eggs in two nests 3 and 2. One youngster was thrown
out but four left the nests and two survived. The
breeding pairs are housed in identical flights 8 ft. x
3 ft. 6 in. x 7 ft. high leading from a bird room heated
in winter to 40*F. Within the bird room is a shelter
4 x 4 x 6 ft. high, the flight and shelter being joined by a
pop-hole. The nest box is described as a Cockatiel nest
with an enlarged entry hole. Twigs are used to form the
bulk of the nest but it is finished off with a cup of fine
fibres or grasses. Mrs. Scamell attaches great import-
ance to there being no disturbances whilst the female is
incubating and whilst the pair are rearing and she
advocates the prompt removal of young once they are

Mr. C. R. Schmidt sends very complete details about the
Rothschild's Mynahs at Zurich. Pair 1 were wild
caught, the male arrived in November 1963, and the
female in May 1964. Prior to 1969 this pair reared 13
young. In 1969 pair 1 nested three times. Nest 1,
number of eggs not given but two young hatched and
reared. Nest 2, four eggs laid, three young hatched
and two raised. Nest 3, three eggs laid and two young
hatched and reared. This pair was housed in an open-
fronted avairy 12x10x3m. high, which is planted on
natural ground. Some 60 other birds of 20 species
share this flight. The nest box was of wood measuring
inside 15x15x15 cm. with an opening 5 cm. Nesting
material used; feathers and fine branches. The young
were removed when independent. This pair have
reared 19 young but the female died in July, 1969.
Pair 2 were captive bred at Zurich, from it is assumed,
pair 1. The male hatched in July 1966, the female in
September the same year. This pair was housed
during the summer in a planted aviary 4x3x3m. high.
This pair nested five times laying in each as follows:
Nest 1, three eggs laid, 1 young hatched but not reared.
Nest 2, number of eggs not given, two young were
hatched but not reared. Nest 3, four eggs laid, two young
were hatched and one fully reared. (This is second
generation captive bred and is almost certainly a stage
beyond any other owner outside Indonesia.) Nest 4,
three eggs were laid and two young were hatched but
not reared. Nest 5, three eggs were laid but the two
hatched young again were not reared. The youngster
was removed when independent. Recorded deaths for
adults at Zurich list visceral gout, general septicaemia
and parasitic worms as known causes. For young the
main cause of death was their eviction from the nest by
the parents between one and 10 days.

io in. deep and 5--6 in. inside diameter. The entrance
is 3 in. in diameter. No nesting material was used but in
enlarging the cavity the pair broke into a lower hole
through the base of their own nest and the eggs were lost.

regulated 70-75*F. and humidity increased by the
presence of a large recirculating double pool.
Chicago Zoological Park, Illinois. (A.S.C.)
These birds are believed to be wild caught and arrived at
Brookfield between 1963-1966.
Columbus Zoological Gardens, Ohio. (A.S.C.)
These birds are believed to have been captive bred in
California; both were received as immature, one in
May 1966, and the other in July 1968.
Conservatory-Aviary, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (A.S.C.)
This pair were obtained from Mr. Alex Isenberg of
Portola Valley, California, in April, 1969, and are adult.
Mr. Roland W. Hawkins, aviculturist to the Con-
servatory-Aviary, has written with the information that
L. rothschildi has been bred in the past but the adults
have been lost. The present pair have been placed in a
small planted " habitat " which is shared with com-
patible species.
Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, Illinois. (A.S.C.)
This single bird was purchased in July 1964, and is
thought to be wild caught.
Los Angeles Zoo, California. (A.S.C.)
These two birds were received from an aviculturist as
adults in June 1966. It is not known if they are wild
caught. They are housed in a large planted cage.
Milwaukee County Zoo, Wisconsin. (A.S.C.)
Mr. Joseph M. Iding, curator of birds, has sent these
details about Milwaukee's success with this species.
The group consisting of two breeding pairs, a non-
breeding pair and four immature are housed in a
50 X 100 ft. planted, heated and air-conditioned com-
munity flight with some 200 other birds of mixed species.
The two breeding pairs remain of six original birds
purchased from Holland in April 1965. The non-
breeding pair now about 2 and 2.\ years old and were
bred, one each, from the breeding pairs. The immature
were bred from both pairs. In such a vast aviary close
inspection is scarcely feasible but in 1969 several nestings
by both pairs took place and pair 1 hatched three young,
pair 2 hatched two young and four from both pairs were
reared. Apart from 1968 when pair 1 laid four eggs in
one nest no other details about clutch sizes are available.
The nest boxes are described as Cockatiel type about
12x12x15 in. high. Recorded nesting material in-
cludes leaves from plants, small twigs, bamboo, and
palm. Mr. Iding obviously feels he can better these

National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D.C. (A.S.C.) 1 1
The male was received from Cleres, France in 1969 and
its origin is unknown and the female's origin and date of
arrival is unknown. The pair is housed in a large
planted community aviary, and in 1969 several nests
of eggs have been laid but no young have been reared to
independence. The nest, 8 x 6 x 6 in. with a hole 2 in. in
diameter, was in a rock wall. Causes of death recorded
for adult stock are: One adult after eight years in the
collection with pneumonia and one adult male died of
trauma as a result of fighting.
New York Zoological Society, Bronx Zoo, New York
City. (A.S.C.) 3 2
All five specimens were wild caught. Two males and
one female were received in November 1967, one male
in October 1961, and one female in December 1961.
There has been no breeding success at the Bronx due to
housing problems. Mr. Joseph Bell, Associate Curator
of Birds, hopes that the building programme now under
way (new planted aviaries and a really large building for
Passeriformes are referred to) will improve matters.
Philadelphia Zoological Garden, Philadelphia. (A.S.C.) 1 1
This pair has bred for the last two years and four eggs
are laid in each clutch (in 1969 two nestings) these so far
have always been infertile. The pair is housed in a
community flight with natural planting and dirt flooring.
A hot air heating system in winter keeps the temperature
between 60--7o*F. This flight is 50 x 30 x 20 ft. high.
The nest box is similar to a large parrakeet box and is
located high in a ficus tree. Mr. John A. Griswold,
curator of birds, writes that the female was purchased
from an English dealer in February 1962, and the male
exchanged for a female of the same species from the
National Zoo in June 1967. The female is doubtless
wild caught.
San Antonio Zoological Gardens, Texas. (A.S.C.) 1
The female is the survivor of a breeding pair which in
1968 reared to independence four young. Three of
these were killed by aggressive starlings and the other
was accidentally killed by a keeper closing a door. The
male died in a fight with a common starling. The female
was captive bred in Los Angeles and was purchased 1967.
The unsexed birds of unknown origin was purchased in
November 1968. The successful breeding of 1968
took place in a community aviary containing 40 birds
of 20 species. The aviary is described as being a planted
diorama of 20 x 20 x 10 ft. with a glass front. The floor
is sand covered which is kept moist with a sprinkler
system. Systems of controlled heating and air cooling
keep the desired temperature range. The next box had
dimensions of 12X12X18 in. and nesting material
included peat moss and dry leaves. The young when
independent were allowed to remain in the aviary.

These two specimens were purchased from a dealer
approximately 4--5 years ago and they were then imma-

5 x 6 x 9 ft. with a sand covered floor. They have been
given a plywood parrot-size nest box, and for nesting

San Diego Zoological Garden, California. (A.S.C.) 4 3
There are three pairs of Rothschild's Mynah and one odd
male at San Diego (the latter, the survivor of the pair,
presumed wild caught, donated to San Diego by Dr.
K. C. Searle in October 1969, and which previously
were with Mr. W. R. Partridge). There have been no
young reared at San Diego since June 1967, and all 11
have been reared by a wild caught pair imported from
Surabaya in September 1961. In 1962 one reared, 1963
three reared, 1964 one reared, 1965 two reared, 1966 two
reared, 1967 two reared. It is interesting to note that all
these successes, except for July 1965 took place in June.
In 1962 when this pair first reared, Mr. Kenton C. Lint,
curator of birds, described the nesting behaviour in some
detail, and from February to June the pair nested five
times (twice eggs were laid but disappeared, twice young
hatched but were deserted, and finally came the success
of what is believed to be the first captive rearing of
L. rothschildi in the U.S.A.). Mr. Lint believes that
three eggs were laid each time but as the nest was
located behind a rock crevice this is conjecture based on
behavioural study. The nesting material used included
grasses, wool, pieces of yarn and leaves. The young
were not removed when independent and apart from the
Searle bird the Rothschild's Mynahs at San Diego consist
of original parents and their young. All breeding took
place in the Rain Forest-Walk-Through Aviary. This
vast structure contains some 200 species of birds and is
167x80x110ft. high. San Diego plans to construct
a special aviary for this species in 197* as P ar * a special
conservation programme. Deaths of adults at San
Diego are attributed to Trauma (no information as to
the nature of this but probably injury from other birds).
The death of young is attributed to desertion by the
parents and pulmonary congestion.

By Philip Wayre, Director (Great Witchingham, Norfolk, England)
The 1969 breeding season in the Norfolk Wildlife Park was reasonably
successful with a total of 158 birds of 35 species reared to maturity.
The most important event of the season was undoubtedly the successful
breeding of three young Stone Curlews Burhinus 0. oedicnemus apparently
for the first time in captivity in this country and possibly in the world.
An adult pair, one of which was originally presented by the R.S.P.C.A.
having a damaged wing, are kept in the Wader enclosure. Last year
(1968) they laid two eggs from which one chick was hatched but failed
to survive the winter. The first egg this year was laid on 14th May and
the second two days later; within a week both eggs were removed and
incubated under a broody bantam. Two chicks hatched on 30th June
and were reared without difficulty on a diet of maggots and mealworms.
The adult laid again on 26th June, apparently only one egg, though a
second egg could have been taken by Jackdaws. The egg was once
again removed and incubated by a bantam. It hatched successfully and
the chick was reared without trouble. All three young birds are alive
and in good health at the time of writing.
A pair of Skylarks Alauda arvensis kept in a small planted aviary built
a nest and laid two eggs on 25th May, but both eggs were subsequently
eaten by field mice. The latter having been dealt with, the birds built a
new nest which was found to contain two eggs on 20th June. Both eggs
hatched on 30th June and one chick was reared to maturity the other
dying when five days old. It is the first time this species has bred in the
collection.
Other passerines to be bred include Wheatear Oenanthe 0. oenanthe
with one chick reared to maturity, Blackbird Turdus m. vierula two,

infertile. The Choughs hatched five young but one died at 14 days old.
The remainder of the brood were then removed and an attempt was made
to hand-rear them but this proved unsuccessful. The Azure-winged
Magpie, which escaped at Easter 1968, managed to survive the winter at
liberty and during the summer built a nest in a thorn bush a few yards
from the aviary containing one of the captive pairs. This bird is still
seen about the park from time to time.
Four young Red-breasted Geese Branta ruficollis were the first to be
bred in the collection. Other waterfowl reared include Swan Goose
Anser cygnoides , European White-fronted Goose Anser a. albifrons ,
Emperor Goose Anser canagicus, Greater Snow Goose Anser coerulescens
atlanticus , Taverner's Canada Goose Branta canadensis taverneri, Barnacle
Goose Branta leucopsis , Common Shelduck Tadorna tadorna , Ashy-

Common Shoveler Anas clypeata , European Eider Somateria mollissima

Mandarin Duck Aix galericulata.
A young Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, sole survivor from a brood of three,
was the first to be reared to maturity in the collection. This species is
very rarely bred in captivity although a brood was successfully reared in
1969 at the Falconry Centre in Gloucestershire. Previous records
include two definite and one doubtful breeding in captivity (Prestwich

Owls did well with five Barn Owls Tyto a. alba, nine European Eagle-
Owls Bubo b. bubo , seven Little Owls Athene noctua vidalii, and four
Tawny Owls Strix a. aluco, reared to maturity. Once again a young pair
of Eagle-Owls was presented to the German Nature Protection Authorities
for release in the Eifel area in an attempt to reintroduce the species there,
while a further two pairs are awaiting shipment to the Conservation
Authorities in Sweden for release in their forests. They will bring the
total of young Eagle-Owls bred in the Wildlife Park and sent to Sweden
for release to 18 since 1964.
Four of the young Barn Owls were released as soon as they were fully
fledged, their parents being kept inside the aviary and the young fed
every night outside on top of it. At the time of writing at least two of the
youngsters are known to be living in the vicinity and are still returning
nightly for their food six months after their release. Similarly five
Little Owls were released and at least one is known to come back every
night for the food left on top of its aviary.

One of the most interesting rearings at Chester Zoo last year was two
Red-masked Conures Aratinga rubrolarvata. The only previous successful
breeder seems to have been W. Shore-Baily who was awarded the Society s
Medal for rearing two young ones in 1925* He was a S a i n successful in
the following year, number reared not recorded. Other birds reared
include one Sclater's Curassow, one Louisiade Lorikeet, three Great
Eagle-Owls, three Crimson-winged Parrakeets, three Derbyan Parrakeets,
one Glossy Starling, and three Barnard's--Pennant's x Port Lincoln
Parrakeets. The Kookaburras hatched two young but failed to rear them.

News from the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode. Donald Risdon writes,
23rd March, 1970: " We already have two couples of Peacock Pheasant
chicks hatched and the full-winged Carolinas have full clutches which
they are just starting to incubate. I think this is the earliest I have ever
known for them. The full-winged Mandarins are not far behind.
I am glad to say that our two baby Scarlet Ibis have survived the winter
and are now showing a few pink feathers.
The Eagle-Owls are calling and have made a scrape, but so far no eggs.
The young pair of Cassowaries we bought last autumn have grown
fantastically during the winter. The smaller of the two, which I hope is a
male, is already turning black ".

Paul Schneider, Riverside, California: " Avicultural-wise 1969 was a
fair year. My wife hand-reared three Leadbeater's Cockatoos; one Alba
Cockatoo, the egg of which was placed under a bantam for 25 days, and
for the remainder of the incubation period in an incubator. Two Grand
Eclectus (males), the eggs of which were incubated by the female for two
weeks, and the remainder in an incubator. The raising of two males
from the same clutch has proved to me that nest mates are not necessarily . j
true pairs. This also applies to doves and pigeons.
Two Indian Ring-necks and three African Greys were also hand-reared.
Successes were obtained with the albino and pied Cockatiels, Many-
coloured, Rock Peplars, lutino Ring-necks, Yellow-fronted Kakarikis
(20 reared), Green Jungle Fowl and Satyr Tragopans. A Hawk-headed
chick and a Port Lincoln chick were both lost at about seven days of age.
I lost my old Satyr Tragopan female on 25th November. I had her in
my possession for some 12 years. The party from whom I purchased her
had had her for some two or three years and she was an imported adult
when he obtained her. She produced every year.
On 8th June while attending the Avicultural Society Meeting at the Los
Angeles Zoo, thieves stole seven lutino, one blue and one split male Ring-
necks. On 27th June the State served us with condemnation papers on

our home for highway construction. We are currently in an expensive
litigation with the bureaucracy over their confiscating ridiculous offer.
In the interim we have had to purchase another place and I spent eight
weeks of my vacation and accumulated time constructing 79 flights
(86 ft. x 112 ft.), and they are a long way from completion. I hope that
by the end of 1970 we will be living a normal life once more ".

Ralph C. Small, Brookfield, Illinois: After nine years as parrot keeper
at the Chicago Zoological Park I have been transferred to the mammal

department. During this time the following birds were raised to maturity
in the parrot house--6 Crimson-winged Parrakeets, 64 Nyasa Lovebirds,
1 lutino Nyasa, 19 Swainson's Lorikeets, 2 Eastern Rosellas, 11 Red and
Yellow x Blue and Yellow Macaws, 13 Hawk-headed Caiques, 2 Cockatiels,
5 Roseate Cockatoos, 5 Plum-headed Parrakeets, 1 Jendaya x Golden-
headed Conure, and 3 Bourke Parrakeets.
My biggest thrill was in 1969 when the Hyacinthine Macaws hatched an
tmt the chick lived for only about z\ days. I do not think the parents
fed it. I was looking forward to the opportunity to try again this year.
The remarkable thing about all these breedings is that they took place in
the parrot house in cages 5 ft. x 5 ft. x 7 ft. high, except for the Macaws--
they were in cages 5 ft. x 8 ft. x 9 ft. high. Even more remarkable the
public could reach over the guard rail and feed the birds. This tends
to make some very nervous and they would refuse to go to nest. Some
would lay and hatch their eggs, and then either kill or throw out the babies
refuse to feed them. The abandoned babies were, with permission,
hand-reared by my wife and myself. It was a very satisfying experience
to watch the tiny babies grow into beautiful adult birds.
The temperature during the winter was kept between 65 0 --75 0 F., but
in the summer it went up as high as no* F. I always kept a night light
on in the building to prevent injury in the dark. During the years other
birds w ere brought into the building to be reared. To name a few, five
Emus, one Darwins Rhea, 18 Wild Turkeys, some pheasants, ducks,
 |geese, swans, quail and peafowl. The past nine years have been quite
rewarding for it is an experience too few are able to have. It is my hope
that some time in the future I will again be able to care for a large collection

PATTERNS OF REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR. By Desmond
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991190384615385" page_id="58076198"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
Morris. London: Jonathan Cape, 197*- Price 84s.
This is a collection of 14 articles which have appeared in various
scientific journals, some out of print. Nine deal exclusively with repro-
ductive patterns and the other five, although covering a wider field, are
included because they have an important bearing on this subject.
Aviculturists will be specially interested in those chapters dealing with
birds. The very complex reproductive behaviour of the Zebra Finch is
described in detail based on the study of 23 individuals, nine of which
were bred in the laboratory. In addition the occurrence of the same or
similar markings in other Australian grass-finches is illustrated diagram-
matically by a comparison of 22 related species. Whilst many of the
component markings are shared between several species, each possesses a
unique combination of markings.
The function and causation of courtship ceremonies contains a number
of examples among birds as well as other groups of vertebrates. The
feather postures of birds and the problem of the origin of social signals
is of especial interest in the interpietation of the social behaviour of birds.
" Typical intensity " and its relation to the problem of ritualization is
followed by a long chapter on the reproductive behaviour of the Bronze
Mannikin. Other chapters confined to the study of birds include one on
the courtship of pheasants and a long account of the comparative ethology
of grass-finches and mannikins. But most of the other chapters also
contain references to birds in the discussions on the reproductive behaviour
of vertebrate species. The response of animals to a restricted environ-
ment will be of especial interest to those concerned in the care of wild
animals, many in laboratories and zoological gardens. E. H.

ON THE LITTLE BEE-EATER
By Derek Goodwin (London, England)

My qualifications for writing about the Little or Least Bee-eater (Merops
pusillus ), are (as I have fully explained to our fair Editor, so blame her
not me!) based on nostalgia rather than knowledge. I have seen the
species only once, and long ago, but my memory of it is vivid.
In May 1941, as a young soldier, I spent a fortnight at Clairewood
Camp, near Durban, South Africa. As Army life went it was a brief period
of almost unimaginable luxury sandwiched between the rigours of six
weeks on a troopship from England and the war in the Middle East. For
]me a very large fly in the otherwise temporarily soothing ointment was
that I had no field glasses. As my readers are, no doubt, also bird-
addicts, I need not enlarge on this misfortune for it to be appreciated by
them!
At the first opportunity I was, of course, away into the surrounding
countryside looking for birds and other creatures. Most of the birds
kept at what was, for me in my binocular-less state, a tantalizing distance.
Then, as I was wandering over some grassland dotted with scrubby
bushes, a flash of bronze and green caught my eye. I saw the bird settle
and, to my delight, it and its four companions stayed settled and allowed
.me to approach to within about 8 ft. and feast my eyes on them.
I can recall even now that I was trembling with excitement and, no
doubt, with fear lest they should fly away before I had noted down their
appearance. I had never in my life seen birds like them before, and
although I realized that they were bee-eaters of some species I had no idea
which, except for realizing that they were certainly not the Bee-eater
[Merops apiaster) of my British bird books. Having hastily made rough
sketches and " colour maps " of them I settled down to a pleasurable
:ew minutes (till they flew further off) watching them. Later I saw
3 reen, Blue-cheeked and European Bee-eaters (M. viridis , M. super-
y&apos;iliosus and M. apiaster ) in Egypt but, beautiful as they were, none of
! hem made so clear and lasting an impression on me as those five Little
Bee-eaters in Natal. The Little Bee-eater is not, perhaps, quite so
striking as some of its relatives but, as the accompanying plate shows, it is
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.667574" page_id="58076213"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
1 lovely bird and, of course, quite different from any species I had seen
3 efore.

The Little Bee-eater has a wide range in Africa, being found from just j
south of the Sahara in West Africa east to Ethiopia and Somaliland south I
to Natal. It is an inhabitant of savanna woodland and scrubby arid I
country. In South Africa it is fond of the vicinity of water (Roberts). |l
Like other bee-eaters the nest is in a burrow of a bank, often quite a low i
one, and sometimes in the roof of an ant-bear hole. Bees, wasps and other jl
insects, mostly caught on the wing are its food, as with most other bee-II
eaters.
A bee-eater that has captured a venomous bee or wasp takes it to a|
perch and prepares it by beating its head against the perch, then gripping |j
it by the tip of the abdomen and rubbing it against the perch to express ]
the venom from the sting. The bird then beats the bee's head one or I
more times again and then swallows it. Fry (1969a), from whose paper I j
these feeding details are abstracted, found that the movements are innate j
but improve with practice. Non-venomous insects are given much less
elaborate treatment. Fry's detailed experiments were made on the!
Red-throated Bee-eater ( M . bullocki) but he mentions having seen the]
same behaviour from wild bee-eaters of several other species, includingij
M. pusillus. There is, however, evidence that some of the larger bee-i
eaters sometimes take bees in continuous flight but it is not known howl
they then prepare them for swallowing (Fry, 1969a).
It has been claimed that the European Bee-eater is immune to bee
and wasp stings, but Fry suggests that, at least in the Red-throated Bee-
eater, this immunity is only partial, as a young bird that was, apparently,
stung by the first few bees it ate, showed signs of distress.
At one time the bee-eaters were divided into several genera mainly on I
the differing shapes of their tails and the present species was put in the
genus Melittophagus. Fry (1969 b), however, puts the Little Bee-eater,|
along with most of the others, in the genus Merops. I conclude withj
references to papers which are recommended to those wishing to learn
further about birds of this interesting and colourful genus.

As so often happens these days, due to building delays, the very short
period between the completion of an animal building and its opening to the
public seldom allows time to provide the most suitable environment for the
inmates. This was the case at the Winged World foui years ago, and only
after the building was open were we able to concentrate on providing more
,suitable quarters for birds with exacting requirements. One of the first
jobs to be tackled was the construction of an artificial wall for tunnel-nesting
birds, bee-eaters in particular, although few shared our optimism that these
birds could be induced to breed in indoor community cages. This
seemingly simple task of providing nesting sites for tunnellers involved the
use of three tons of rock and seven tons of soil. This was carried piece by
piece and sackful by sackful along a tortuous route at least one hundred
yards from the nearest access point, up a slope, two flights of steps and
through two narrow doorways. Some of the rocks weighed almost two
hundredweight.
It was built into a wall in which gaps, approximately one foot square,
were left. These were later covered with a wire-mesh screen in which
small holes were left, and a weak plaster mixture, dyed the colour of the
rocks, was trowelled over the screen. A retaining wall was then built about
six feet behind this rock face, and the gap between filled with soil and
planted. Vines were also planted in crevices left between the rocks. The
soil soon became quite impacted and birds perching on the lip of the two-
inch diameter entrance holes were confronted with a solid mass of soil into
which they could tunnel.
Four Little Bee-eaters were housed in this exhibit, but far from being
accasionally gregarious, as they apparently sometimes are in the wild state,
die first pair to come into breeding condition would not tolerate the
 |presence of the others. Their first nesting attempt, in the spring of 1969,
was unsuccessful as they chose one of the holes nearest the top of the wall.
The depth of soil over their tunnel was therefore no more than a few
inches, and as we feared, the front part of their tunnel collapsed soon after
:hey started feeding their young. Shortly afterwards a group of five
Carmine Bee-eaters were obtained from West Africa and placed in this
exhibit, but in the spring of this year the Little Bee-eaters became so
iggressive that it was necessary to remove the several times larger Carmine
Bee-eaters for their own safety. Both Little Bee-eaters were observed
excavating a new tunnel, once again near the top of the wall, in the middle
)f March. Towards the end of the month it became apparent that egg-
aying and possibly incubation had commenced, because of the long period

of absence of one of the birds. As far as we could tell incubation started on j
4th April, and on the 25th of the month the first of the many visits to the |
tunnel with food commenced. Both parents fed the nestlings with meal-;
worms, mealworm pupae and blowflies. Crickets and locusts were also
offered but were ignored. From entering the nest-hole with food to
reappearing again no more than four seconds elapsed, and often only three,
so we naturally assumed that the tunnel was short, possibly about eighteen
inches long, but we never took the risk of inspecting the entrance hole or
tunnel during incubation and rearing for fear of upsetting the birds.
The other species in their compartment--breeding pairs of Fairy Blue
Birds and Yellow-breasted Fruit Pigeons--plus pairs of Van den Bocks
Pittas and Scimitar Babblers, were never aggressive towards the Bee-eaters.
The Babblers, however, were a nuisance because of their continual
investigation of the tunnel entrance, no doubt out of curiosity as they had
never molested the more vulnerable Pigeon and Blue Bird nestlings. On
many occasions the Bee-eaters had to wait until the Babblers had moved
away before they could enter the hole, so the latter were removed.
During the early days of rearing two dozen trips with food, on several
occasions daily were observed, yet towards the latter part of the rearing
period the food-carrying visits became less frequent, and we were concerned
that some of the nestlings may have been lost. Even a few days before the
young eventually emerged we witnessed no more than a handful of visits 1
with food daily.
Obviously the bulk of the feeding was done in the many hours of
daylight before and after our normal working hours. After a rearing period
of exactly 28 days three nestlings appeared. One was a poor flier, another
could manage reasonably well, although it could not perch, and both
consequently spent most of the time on the floor. The third nestling was
poorly feathered and replaced in the tunnel. The nestlings at this stage
were green above, had a black eye streak, brownish white throat, and pale
green underparts streaked with green on the breast. They were the same
size as the adults, but their bills were short and straight. Two days later
the most backward of the two still out of the tunnel disappeared, and we
assumed it had returned to the nest. This proved to be correct, for the |
following day saw the reappearance of this and the third nestling. Neither j
could fly properly, and as it soon became obvious that the parents were
ignoring them they were removed. One died within the hour, but the
poorly feathered one was successfully hand reared. This breeding
attempt therefore reached a successful conclusion as the other youngster ?
was reared to independence by the parents.
As described above the Little Bee-eater (Merops pusillus ) has been bred I
at the Winged World. It is believed this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once*
with the Hon. Secretary.

(Pyrrhura melanura)
By Mrs. Brenda Rhodes (Sowerby, Yorkshire, England)
The size of these birds is about 10 in. They are a lovely dark green
with a large white eye ring, beaks and feet are grey, a wide collar of creamy
vhite tipped feathers, some maroon feathers on the abdomen, long flight
eathers are dark bluish, underwings are scarlet, and the tail is dark
naroon.
There is no apparent difference in the sexes; when I bought mine I
*exed them by the pelvic bone method. Possibly the hen's head is very
slightly flatter than the cock's, and my hen has more maroon feathers on
ler abdomen. There is no difference in the behaviour of my pair when
lot breeding.
They live in a flight in the bird hut next to a pair of Moustached
3 arrakeets. It is only a small flight about 3 ft. x 3 ft. 3 in. x 6 ft. high.
\lso in the hut there are cages of Lovebirds, Budgerigars, one pair of
\ymara Parrakeets, one pair of Tovi Parrakeets and one pair of Plumhead
parrakeets in a flight at the other end of the hut. There are also Waxbills
md Finches flying free in the work space of the hut.
The hut is heated and the temperature is about 58*F. They are nice
juiet birds. Their normal diet is sunflower seed with apple, grated carrot
md millet sprays.They were always given budgie seed but never touched
t until they started to breed. As they like to chew wood they always
lave a supply of willow twigs to save their perches, etc.
I bought these birds in July 1968. They were given a nest box on
&apos;[St December 1968, size about 9 in. square, 18 in. deep with 2 in. peat
n the bottom, but did not go near it for about three months when they
tarted to sleep in it at night. At the end of October 1969 the hen started
o go into the box during the day. They were seen mating on more than
me occasion during January 1970. On 1st February I think she laid her
irst egg and started to sit. There was no chance of looking into the
lest box unless I looked while she was sitting, so I did not take that risk
md did not see her again until the babies were about 10 days old.
On 26th February I first heard faint squeakings coming from the nest
&amp;gt;ox. Also at that time the cock started to be plucked till at the end of
me week he was bald.
L
As soon as I heard the first squeaking I gave them extras, soaked
afflower seed, soaked millet sprays, and they started to eat a little
rndgie seed. I gave them soft food made of canary rearing food, P. Sluis
i .1.0., grated carrot, grated cuttlefish bone (as the parents never touch
he cuttlefish bone), all mixed with water, also extra apple. I always

put Cytacon and Abidec drops in the water of all my birds that are
feeding young.
I heard the babies being fed at some time every day and at six weeks
old could hear them trying their wings in the nest. Then at seven weeks
old the first baby was out in the flight when I went into the hut. The
hen stays in the nest box with the young most of the time.
The baby is just a bit smaller than the parents, with a shorter tail but
like them in plumage except there is not as much scaly marking round the
throat and this is much fainter. The beak is just a bit paler and has a
small lump on each side of the top beak (I expect its just not hardened
up yet). I am very pleased to say that they are not plucked at all and
look perfect, the red in the wings and the rest of the colouring seems just
as bright as that of the parents.
The babies went back into the nest often at first and they all sleep in the
nest at night. Seeing just one baby for a few days and thinking it the
only one, I looked into the nest box to find another baby and one egg, so
with the egg found in the flight about two weeks before, it would seem
she laid four eggs and hatched and reared two babies.
At eight weeks old, on the first day the youngest was out of the nest for a
while, the parents were seen mating again. The babies continued to
thrive for a few more days, but as I thought the parents wanted to go to
nest again and the young ones seemed to be feeding themselves, I took
them away and brought them into the house in a cage to keep my eye on
them for a while. They have now been on their own and eating for
themselves for four days and are still keeping fit and well They are both
inquisitive and lively, and I am very thrilled with them.
Mr. Clifford Smith of Denholm came to see my birds while the young
were being reared in the nest, then he came again to see them when they ;
had fledged and saw both babies in the flight with their parents. He is in
agreement with me that they are beautiful youngsters.
j
As described above, Mrs. Brenda Rhodes has bred the Black-tailed
Conure (Pyrrhura melanura). It is believed this may be a first success:

These handome Rufous Laughing-thrushes (Garrulax caerulatus) come
rom Formosa. The head, back, wings and tail are a uniform brown,
he throat paler and more beige, the belly greyish, and the under tail
! ! :overts white. The birds have blue skin around and behind the eye, and
1 black or very dark blue streak under the eye. The bill is yellow with a
lark base. There are white tips on the two outermost tail feathers which
;an be revealed when the tail is flicked and partly expanded. Although
:he sexes are alike they can easily be sexed by separating the birds and
istening to their call-notes. The female starts with one note and then
ive to seven higher notes which the male will usually answer immediately
with varied musical notes.
I have had this pair for nearly five years and in the last three six young
)nes were reared, nine having been hatched. One I hand-reared and it
was the most charming pet and loved having its feathers scratched; but
infortunately it succumbed to gapes at the age of 14 months. It twice
&apos;ecovered pretty well after I had swabbed its throat and trachea with
Listerine and Vick's formula 44, but the third attack was fatal. The other
ive young were well-grown and had become independent when I found
:wo drowned in their shallow pond, another hung itself, and the last one
vent through a hole in the wire-netting into the next aviary and was killed
3y a magpie.
The birds built on the first occasion a deep cup-shaped nest in a bamboo
:hicket at about five feet from the ground, using sticks, bamboo leaves,
*rass and horse-hair. Four blue eggs were laid each time, and the same
nest was used for three sittings between April and July. A new nest
j was built in almost the same spot in the second year. Last year only one
fitting occurred with three eggs and all hatched but none lived beyond
fight days. The nest was built in their shelter in a thick Ficus vine.
Live crickets and mealworms were given; and also meat and hard-boiled
^gg with toasted wheat-germ, some fruit, and peanuts.
At the time of writing I have only the parents and can only hope they
will nest again this year. I believe this to be a first breeding of these
I birds and would like to hear if anyone else has been this fortunate.

By Clive Roots (Heysham, Lancs., England)
We imported a pair of this attractive species from Bombay three years
ago, but on several occasions were tempted to dispose of them due to
their destructive habits. With the exception of the oropendolas and
aracaris they are possibly the most destructive of all the many species of
softbills that we have attempted to house in our exotically-planted aviaries.
Eventually it became necessary to move them to a plantless aviary
designated specifically for plant wreckers. The Southern Tree Pie
( De?idrocitta leucogaster ) is a splendid black, white and coffee coloured
species with a tail almost 12 in. long. They are seldom available to
aviculture even though they are apparently fairly common in the Southern j
part of India. I have never found them to be aggressive towards other
birds, even species much smaller than themselves, and for once the
frustrations experienced, before we eventually succeeded in breeding these
birds in the summer of 1969, were not due to the close proximity of other
birds. A small wire mesh basket was provided, into which twigs and
other nest materials had been interwoven. All but the sturdiest outer
twigs were removed by the birds and they were completely disinterested
in the wide variety of other nesting materials which were offered. Eggs
were eventually laid on the bare mesh and of course were soon cracked.
A sod of turf solved the problem, as it withstood removal attempts and
provided a relatively soft base for the eggs which were off-white and
heavily streaked with black and brown.
Two chicks hatched after an incubation period of 19 days. Maggots,
mealworms and crickets were provided, but the most acceptable form of
food, from the day they hatched, were young mice, which the parents
dismembered and gave to the chicks in minute pieces. Eighteen days were
spent in the nest, and the youngsters at this stage resembled the adult
birds minus their long tails. The over-zealous hen commenced plucking&amp;quot;
them soon afterwards, and it became a race against time whether they
would be plucked bare before they were completely independent. Four-
teen days after leaving the nest they were left with only their primary
feathers and we had no alternative but to move them. By this time they
had commenced to feed independently, however, and it was not necessary
to hand feed them. After rearing these youngsters the parents became
dissatisfied with their nesting facilities and on one occasion removed all
nesting material when they had young in the nest. Once on the aviary
floor these nestlings were regarded as a source of food and were soon
killed by the &amp;quot;Free Pies themselves. Fortunately, the nesting problem
has been solved once more by wiring hessian into the bottom of their
basket and they have bred again.

In any mixed collection of birds the tree-hole nesting species obviously
i stand a far better chance of successfully incubating their eggs and rearing
their young than those which build exposed nests. This is particularly
so where the smaller hole drillers are concerned, as the entrance hole to
their nest cavity is small enough to provide a safe retreat from prospective
egg stealers. The successful breeding of the small Brown-throated Barbet
(Tncholaema melanocephalum stigmatothorax ) provides ample proof of this
fact, whereas the nesting attempts of the other birds in their planted
compartment at the " Winged World " have been foiled by the continual
jockeying for the choicest sites and nesting material. These Barbets, and
the other arboreal nesting species prefer to drill their own holes into the
semi-rotten tree trunks provided for this purpose, and only when these are
unavailable do they resort to using nest boxes. Due to the nature of the
nest-hole, which had an entrance no more than one inch in diameter and
then appeared to drop vertically into the trunk, we were unable to ascertain
how many eggs were laid, or exactly how long the incubation period was,
although we consider it to have been about 12 days. Both sexes shared
the incubation duties, and mealworms, maggots and house crickets were
taken into the nest cavity. After eight days our prepared insectile and
minced beef mixture was taken in, and a little fruit, too. Only a single
nestling resulted from this breeding, and from a subsequent one also.
Both adult birds fed the nestling, which appeared at the entrance of the
nest hole approximately two weeks after hatching. They continued to
feed it for several weeks, but would not tolerate its presence when they
went to nest again.

A pair of Yellow-breasted Fruit Pigeons (Ptilinopus occipitalis) have been
housed in the " Winged World " since we stocked the aviaries, three years
ago. They attempted to nest on several occasions when we kept them in
the free flight area, but were thwarted by the many Toucans, Jays and other
omnivorous species there. I hey were eventually settled into a large
planted compartment in company with numerous Bee-eaters, Pittas, Fairy
Bluebirds and other non-aggressive species and soon made use of the
flat-based plastic wire nest-basket which had been positioned at the
highest point on the rear wall. Fine hay was placed in this and was used
for nesting without the addition of any other material. Late in 1969 two
eggs, typically pigeon shape and colour, were laid in the nest, and were
incubated undisturbed by both birds for about 17 days, although the exact
incubation period was difficult to ascertain as they both sat tightly, and
changed over very quickly. When a chick was first seen in the nest it
appeared to be two or three days old. Neither were the parent birds seen
feeding the single chick which resulted from this first successful breeding,
although this has been observed during the further two successful
breedings which have occurred this year.
The other birds in the compartment were ignored by the adult pigeons
however close they ventured to the nest. On one occasion several
Carmine Bee-eaters were allowed to perch on the side of the nest con-
taining the chick. When it eventually left the nest after 14 days and
moved to nearby branches, it was about half the size of the parents, and
had the same basic green colouration, but lacked their bright markings.
Six months later, these markings, particularly the deep yellow patch on
the breast, are beginning to show. The two subsequent breedings this .
year have also produced one youngster each.
At the " Winged World " Fruit Pigeons are treated as omnivorous
birds, but we so often hear of instances of these birds receiving a diet of
fruit alone. A check on the content of the cultivated fruits that are
available to aviculturists will reveal that they are little more than expensive
water. Their protein content is practically nil, and most are either
devoid of, or very low in, vitamins and minerals. Our Fruit Pigeons
receive a typical omnivorous softbill diet, comprising diced fruit liberally
laced with vitamins and minerals and a good quality insectile mixture
with which is mixed equal parts of raw minced beef. Maggots and meal-
worms are eaten with relish.

By J. J. Walsh (Drouin, Victoria, Australia)
In 1968 I was offered a pair of African Song Sparrows (Passer luted ),
both young birds; and as I was told that they were hardy enough to
withstand the cold winter weather to which we are subjected in this
district, I was all too eager to try them. Both birds were still in their
juvenile plumage but moulted into adult plumage during the first winter.
The female stayed grey-brown with horn-coloured bill and legs, but the
male became quite different. Body, head and face became a pretty
lemon yellow, wings and tail brown, bill black, and legs horn-coloured.
During the month of September I noticed that the birds were objecting
to my presence in the aviary. The two chattered and complained every
time I approached to feed. This caused me to wonder what was wrong,
and on making a closer inspection of the sheltered section I found a large
untidy nest erected in some Tea-tree hung in the shelter. The huge nest
structure appeared to be camouflage for the small nest cavity in the centre
reserved for the eggs. After about three weeks two chicks fledged from
the nest, after loud chirping from the nest during the week which had
preceded their flight. Both proved to be females. In the 1969 season a
further five chicks fledged and are doing well.
African Green Singing Finches (Serinus mozambicus) also nested in the
last season, but the first two nests proved failures, the parents sitting for
ten days and then deserting the eggs. When the third clutch of three
white eggs were laid I placed them under a canary which kindly agreed
to take charge of them. All three chicks hatched and were reared by the
canaries and are now fully coloured and beautiful birds. The Green
Singers laid again and this time reared two chicks which fledged from the
nest but only lived one week owing to a cold snap. The aviary is
40 ft. x 18 ft. x 9 ft. high with S in. mouse-proof wire. It has permanent
water in the form of a pond, but this is only shallow. The aviary is fully
planted with mainly evergreen shrubs, affording great protection for all
the inhabitants.

On nth July 1967 a young Swallow (Hirundo rustica), about ten days
old, was handed to me. I put it into a canary nest pan lined with cotton
wool, and put this into a budgerigar nest-box. Feeding it presented no
problem. It accepted bread and milk, hard-boiled egg and minced heart.
Four mealworms were given with each feed. The first feed was given
at 7 a.m. and then every three hours until dusk.
On 20th July it started sitting on the perch just below the hole of the
nest-box, frequently exercising its wings. If anything frightened it, it
flew back into the nest. By 22nd July it had learned to fly around the
kitchen, and would come and sit on my finger to be fed. During the
next two days I took it outside many times, but once it went off over the
buildings, out of sight. I called and in less than a minute it was back on
my finger. I gave it a few mealworms and it was off again and back on
my finger in a very short time.
This went on for two days; the flights gradually lengthening, and it
started to fly into the kitchen through a small open window only 9 in.
square. For about two weeks it flew in and out of the window during the
day. I hung a sack over the window each evening so that it was in for its
first feed in the morning. When on the wing it caught insects and also
went to one of the lakes for water, but still expected its mealworms when it
returned. On 26th August at 9.30 a.m. it went off and was not seen again.
Another young swallow was handed to me during the second week of
September 1968. This one had flown into a moving car and injured its
wing. It was fed the same diet as the first but I had to force feed it.
Because it was unable to fly I kept it in a box-type canary cage
18 in. x 12 in. x 15 in. with two natural perches and a dish of water. I also
put in a dish of mealworms. After a few days it was feeding itself on meal-
worms so I put some Sluis Universal Food in with the mealworms and
stopped force feeding it. I offered it bread and milk in a separate con-
tainer but this was not touched. It did eat some of the Sluis mixture.
When the injured wing was stronger it started to fly from perch to perch.
I decided to leave the cage door open and to fix some twiggy branches
around the room. Very soon the bird came out and flew around the
room using the perches to rest on. It did not find any difficulty getting
back to its cage for food. From then on the cage door was never shut.
The injured wing always stuck out slightly. I did not notice any
migratory urge in my swallow, but perhaps the injured wing accounted
for this. Since the wing was not strong enough for flight until late
November it was not possible to release it in the autumn. By 1st January
it was able to catch a few flies that it managed to find. The wild swallows

By Alan Booth --(M.V. Trecarrell , at sea)
During the present voyage I have tried to keep a record of birds which
came on board the ship, particularly after strong winds from the coast.
On the crossing from England to the Gulf States of America, we did
encounter such winds from the Bahamas. On the following morning
the following birds were on the ship: a small blackbird with white under-
parts and orange-red wing and tail patches, this was later identified from
R. Tory-Peterson s book, A Field Guide to Birds ", as the American
Redstart. It was also accompanied by a female, both birds were very
tame as they even entered the accommodation in search of food. The
others, of which at least four were counted, were small, wren-sized,
olive green above, white abdomen, bright yellow breast, black mask
bordered posteriorly white, these were again identified from the above
book as Yellow-throated Warblers.
The two species were new to me and I had an opportunity to watch
them for at least four days before they left us at the Providence Channel,
in the early morning, as they were not seen again. During these four
days they were all seen looking for insects, and were seen to take very
small cues, which must have been blown out on the same winds, as well
as those already on the ship.
On entering the Gulf of Mexico we again had strong winds from the
north so we had more warblers and some herons. These were white,
small sized with yellow bill and black legs, which were identified as
American Egrets. Six were seen flying around the ship on the first day,
four flew off but two remained and stayed until the following day. They
were joined by a small, very dark heron with white abdomen, dark
greenish upper parts and purplish breast. This was identified as the
Louisiana Heron. They were all gone next day as we approached
Galveston. The other bird was an adult Mangrove Cuckoo which was
so tame we were able to approach within 2 ft. of it, before it moved away
down the wire hanging from the ship's derrick, which were horizontal at
the time. He, too, had disappeared on approach to land.
The river, from Galveston to Houston, was the most profitable as the
following birds were seen with the aid of binoculars: Laughing Gulls,
White Pelicans, Roseate Spoonbill, Large White Heron, Large Blue
Heron, and Black-Crowned Night Heron. The Spoonbill, large blue,

and Night Heron were all seen at the same colony. A few Skimmers
were seen to take fish from the river where they were feeding. In
Houston the Common Nighthawks were seen flying both at night and day;
as they were at all ports in this area we visited. The Boat-tailed Grackle
was seen in great numbers at the mouth of the Mississippi.
The birds seen on the way down from New York to New Orleans were
as follows: Cape May Warbler (male), Brown Thrasher, Cat Bird (male),
and a female Towhee. These were all identified with the help of the
Peterson book. Each only stayed for about a day since we were only just
off the coast.
Since this was only the beginning of the voyage, I am hoping more birds
will make their appearance on the ship during the remainder of it.

"ESCAPES"
By Derrick England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
At some time or other most aviculturists have inadvertently allowed a
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.988818" page_id="58076226"  page_num="150" year="" vol="">
bird to escape. Quite often it does not go very far and shows clearly
that it wants to re-enter the aviary, especially if it has a mate there.
Sometimes it may remain tantalizingly in the neighbourhood, every now
and then flying over the house, but never coming close enough to be
recaptured. For weeks and even months, neighbours telephone to say
that it is in their garden and " do come and catch it ", though more often
than not it has gone before the owner can arrive.
Some of these birds manage to find a living in the wild and to survive
for considerable periods; many, one suspects, meet a comparatively quick
death either because their period of captivity has blunted their awareness
of the danger from predators or because they cannot find sufficient food.
Even if suitable food exists, a bird which for years has fed from a dish or a
hopper may not be able to find enough to keep it alive when free.
Escape may occur in a number of ways, from the all-too-easy family .
pet through the sitting-room window " to the accidently open door of a
large aviary at a zoo. A very frequent source of curious birds in the
wild is the bird-keeper who, although he knows that his birds are not all
permanently pinioned, puts off the clipping of the wings of those which
are not until it is too late.
Most " escapes " are sufficiently unlike native British birds for it to be
obvious even to a casual observer that the bird which is visiting their
bird-table is something unusual, leading to a telephone call to a more
kn owledgeable friend. Others attract less attention even from ornitho-
logists--either because they are natural " skulkers " or keep high in dense
foliage, or because, immediately they escape, they fly far away to the
nearest they can find to their natural habitat, woodland, broad open fields,
marsh-land or estuaries.

It is unfortunately true to say that not all aviculturists are also field
ornithologists and, however much they deplore it when they do accidently
lose a bird, many are unaware of the confusion--and indeed sheer hard
work--which escapes may cause among those people who are responsible
for recording wild birds, and especially among those who are concerned
with the rare or unlikely visitors to this country.
A small body of ornithologists called the " Rarities Committee " was
set up some years ago by the Editors of the monthly journal British Birds
to consider each occurrence of a bird which is so rare that it has pre-
viously been acceptably recorded only a very few times. One of the
chief objects was to achieve a uniformity of assessment of the evidence
submitted in each case, in a way which was not possible when records
were scrutinized only by local ornithologists. In the case of a bird
which would be completely new to the British list, this committee does not
publish the record until it has been considered and confirmed by a similar
committee of the British Ornithologists Union.
The writer of these notes has the task of scrutinizing all records sub-
mitted and attending meetings of the Rarities Committee in order to
advise on the likelihood or otherwise of a recorded rarity having escaped
from captivity (ducks and geese excluded). Each year this becomes more
difficult as an ever-widening variety of species becomes available to
aviculturists; indeed, the stage is rapidly being reached where, given
the knowledge and the money, it will be possible to obtain in Britain all
but the remotest and little-known species. As an example of this, a
Snow Finch spent the best part of 12 months in and around an airfield in
East Anglia. Those who heard about it were so certain that it could not
possibly be a wild bird that no-one troubled to report it formally to the
Rarities Committee--the date of its arrival was wrong; its habitat was
wrong; it was ridiculous to suppose that it had not escaped from captivity.
It was not until the writer pointed out that he knew of no Snow Finches
in captivity in this country and that they were most infrequently imported
that it was taken seriously.
A Scops Owl recently reported in the west country gives an example of
a different kind. The writer was aware that a very few are in captivity
in this country--chiefly in zoological gardens--and that, therefore, one
or two are occasionally imported. He admits that he would very much
like a pair of those beautiful little owls in his own collection and, even more,
a pair of Pygmy Owls. It is putting it very mildly, however, to say that
he was horrified to find, on enquiring about their availability (and thus
the corresponding likelihood of their escape) that one dealer alone was
importing Scops Owls (of various species) in crates of 20 and that, the
supply having temporarily run out, " a hundred more are arriving next
Wednesday ".
It is not within the terms of reference of this brief article to discuss
either the ethical or the conservation aspects of this state of affairs, and the

writer would be the last to oppose the acquisition, by those people who
know how to look after them, of a very few Scops Owls each year. It is,
however, difficult to refrain from the comment that neither aviculturists
nor field ornithologists will have the pleasure of seeing Scops Owls at all
if this sort of thing is allowed to continue. Nor is it any consolation
to reflect that many die before loading on the plane in their country of
origin and that, of those which survive to reach a pet-shop , the
majority die a miserable death as a child's pet, fed on bread and milk.
Quite certainly serious aviculturists in this country do not provide a
market for numbers such as these.
The main object of this brief paper, having drawn attention to the
increasing difficulties of deciding whether some birds are wild or have
escaped, is to enlist the help of all readers, whether they be curators of
zoological gardens or owners of a few pet birds. If they accidently lose
a bird which might be reported as being wild--ducks and geese excluded--
will they please immediately notify the writer at the address below. If
this address has been forgotten or mislaid the information would be
forwarded if addressed to the Editor of this journal or to the secretary of
the Avicultural Society, but the appropriate address should be used if
possible.
Members should be selective in their reporting, because a high pro-
portion of birds kept in captivity can be ruled out. Thus parrots and
humming birds may obviously be excluded and a little imagination will
suggest a great many more. Care should, however, be exercised in the
case of birds which, although their country of origin is too far away for
them to have arrived " unassisted ", could be mistaken in the field for
birds on the British list. For example, Indian Rollers, many of which
are imported, could be confused with the European Roller and Bay-
backed Shrikes might at a brief glance be thought to be Lesser Grey
Shrikes. All thrush-like birds and " little brown jobs " should be
reported, the latter including female and out-of-colour weavers and
whydahs, and certainly all north American birds. Despite the fact that
few species of storks, cranes or flamingoes are likely to occur wild in
Britain, it would be helpful if all of them--and all pelicans--were reported
too, and, of course, all birds of prey from falconets to vultures. If there
is the slightest chance that an " escapee " could be thought to be a wild
bird, it is better to report than to be reticent--quite certainly no informa-
tion will be ridiculed and all will be gratefully received.
It is perhaps relevant to conclude by saying that this " information
bureau " can work both ways--a number of escaped birds have been
retrieved by their owners as a result of information given to and received
from the Rarities Committee.

By Rosemary Low (Sidcup, Kent, England)
I he Massena's Parrot, or White-capped Parrot (Pionus seniloides ) from
the central and eastern Andes of Colombia and the Andes of Ecuador, is
little known to aviculturists. I can only find one reference to this species
in confinement. Contained in the Avicultural Magazine for September
I 933&amp;gt; Walter Goodfellow described how, while collecting in Quito,
Ecuador, he had in his possession two Massena's or Grey-headed Parrots,
as he called them. They had the freedom of two or three rooms together
with a number of Bronze-wing, Blue-headed and Coral-billed Parrots,
caiques, Amazons and conures. The Massena's had been hand-reared
from the nest and used to sleep in a basket with a pair of Black-headed
Caiques. Goodfellow had a high regard for the members of the genus
Pionus as pets.
Unfortunately, the Duke of Bedford's description of the Massena's
Parrot would not inspire enthusiasm in anyone. He described it as
untidy looking with " the appearance of a bird making a half-hearted
effort at albinism or suffering from weak feather growth." The scientific
name seniloides " meaning " resembling the aged " is equally uncompli-
mentary and unjustified.
I was fortunate enough to obtain a young bird of this species in
December; it is, in my opinion, a most attractive little parrot and its
pretty markings are invariably commented on.
It has no bright colours except for the pinkish-red of the under tail
coverts and the area surrounding the vent. In common with most
members of the genus, the head colouring is rather complicated and
difficult to describe. The head feathers are a mixture of dark grey, pink
and pinkish or bufhsh-white, the centres of the feathers being a light
colour, edged usually with dark grey. The feathers of the ear coverts are
dark grey with pink centres, the small feathers at the side of the beak
having white centres. The forehead and crown feathers are a lighter
^rey with pinkish centres and white bases and the large feathers of the
nape are pinkish white. The beak is pale yellow and the area of bare skin
surrounding the eye is white. The iris is brown. The upper breast is
dark vinous coloured with some of the feathers below the throat showing
salmon-coloured centres. The lower breast is a more pinkish vinous
colour. The wings, back, rump and the upper surface of the tail are a
iniform dark green. There is a pinkish-vinous patch at the base of the tail.
The length is io in.
On examination of a number of skins of this species, I found that the
narkings were very variable; the underparts, for example, varied from
lark green with a vinous tinge to the upper breast only, to the whole of the

breast vinous-coloured. The depth of colour on the breast is probably
an indication of age, the immature birds being greener in this area.
Certainly, my own bird has developed more colour on the breast in the
five months it has been in my possession.
Soon after I bought it, it began to take grapes from my fingers and to
nibble playfully at my hand. After about two months, I opened the cage
door, but the open doorway was ignored until I placed a twig across it.
This was immediately investigated and the Massena's was soon outside,
climbing around the top of the cage. Some time was spent sitting there
before it suddenly took wing and circled the room two or three times,
flying with much confidence. After landing on the picture rail several
times, it dropped almost vertically on to the cage and was soon back
inside. The flight of this species is strong and direct; it is also able to
hover.
This little parrot is absolutely ideal as a pet--it is intelligent, inquisitive
and full of mischief. It delights in exploring different parts of the room
and has never done any damage. This is just one aspect of the superiority,
in my opinion, of this genus as pets, over Amazon Parrots. They are
nowhere near as noisy as Amazons and except for a five minute session of
shrieking every day, inspired by my Amazon and carried out in com-
petition, the Massena's is not noisy. The greatest disadvantage of
Amazons as pets is seldom mentioned: when adult and really fit their
tempers can seldom be trusted; when in breeding condition they are,
unfortunately, often dangerous and certainly not suitable as pets for
children or for anyone who is nervous of a parrot's beak. Pionus are very
gentle--they may nip playfully but seldom cause real harm. I doubt
whether they would learn to speak more than a few words and have not
the ability to whistle like Amazons but talking parrots have little attraction
for me.
My Massena's is very fond of fruit and greenfood and, apart from spray
millet, which is consumed with relish, shows little interest in sunflower,
loose millet or canary seed. Any fruit or greenfood is eaten including
grapes, apple, orange, tangerine, cabbage, spinach, dandelion leaves,'
seeding grasses and chickweed. When soft fruit is in season, especially
cherries, I have no doubt that it will be eagerly eaten.
I feel sure that the bird will become very tame--it has flown on to my
shoulder several times and comes to me to have its head rubbed as soon
as it sees the twig which I use to scratch its head.

Australian parrots present a fascinating challenge to the conserva-
tionist and the scientist.
With 53 species listed for continental Australia and some neighbouring
islands, they form one of the most varied and numerous groups of the
order Psittaciformes in the world. Aesthetically, they are amongst the
most beautiful birds anywhere on earth; some of them have evolved a
coloration which is so exquisite as to defy description.
While some species appear to have decreased partly as a result of
European settlement, othes have benefited and their numbers and their
range extended greatly. Parrots are as much a part of the Australian bush
scene as the gum trees and the kangaroos. One can hardly travel any-
where in this continent and in some islands, without encountering parrots
of some species. And in certain areas, one may actually see clouds of
these birds aloft. Recently, a Western Australian naturalist watched
flocks of Budgerigars which he estimated to number some 20,000 birds.
And I have often seen the sun-parched trees covered with little corellas,
completely white birds so that it looked as though a snowfall had just
blanketed the trees.
But the parrot situation in Australia has many facets. As I write this,
one of the most common of our parrots, the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, is
protected in some states, but not protected in others. It is not protected,
for instance, in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and in my
Queensland country town an adult bird of this species sells for $Aio,
a young one for $A20. This explains the popularity of these birds even
in their homeland. The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo or White Cockatoo
is one of our finest " talkers " and hence a much coveted pet.
Budgerigars sell for $Ai a pair, but other rarer species such as the
turquoise parrot sells for $Aio a pair. Exportation of parrots is forbidden
but there is a lively--and quite legal--trade in these birds throughout
Australia. Many Australians living in bush towns make considerable
sums of money from trapping and selling parrots. A friend of mine who
is a full-time fireman supplements his income with parrot trapping and
receives regular orders for consignments of 100 or 200 birds at a time,
I rapping involves little expense but much patience and bush work.
Usually, box traps are set in areas where parrots feed. " Callers " (aviary
birds) are placed in the traps and these decoy the wild parrot to the traps.
In a good day a trapper can catch 30 or 40 parrots.
The popularity of some species is, however, badly offset by the unpopu-
larity of others. For instance, the galah, one of the better known
Australian parrots, was declared a pest in certain Western Australian

districts after flocks of this bird played havoc in wheat fields causing
serious losses to the growers. Similar stories come from other parts of
Australia.
Certain rosellas, among which are some of the most beautiful species in j
this country, are also most unpopular. A farmer friend of mine and his
two sons shot 235 Pale-headed Rosellas over a week as the birds pounced
on the milo fields. Naturally, this species is not protected in Queensland.
By their status of abundance, Australian parrots fall into these cate-
gories: abundant, common, rare and very rare. Among the most j
abundant throughout a large section of eastern Australia, are some 1
lorikeets such as the Rainbow Lorikeet, the Musk Lorikeet, the Scaley- j
breasted and the Little Lorikeet.
The Rainbow Lorikeet is one of the most colourful species and, like j
the other lorikeets, a vociferous bird which makes its presence felt by |
strident calls. Lorikeets feed largely on blossoms or on the nectar therein j
and the rainbow is no exception. A nomadic bird that travels in small ,
flocks, it follows the blossoming gums and tea-tree (Melaleuca) and dozens |
of these birds can be heard and seen feeding on the blossom of these trees j
in many bush areas.
The feeding habits of our parrots are variable; most cockatoos feed on j
grain, seeds, and some take insects and their larvae. One of these, the 1
glossy Black Cockatoo has rather specialized feeding habits. A glossy |
black bird with a rather funereal appearance, it occurs sparsely in mountain
forests of eastern Australia usually in areas where Sheoaks or Casuarina
trees are plentiful. Much of its food derives from these trees. It will I
eat mainly the seeds contained in the cones. I have often watched some
eating; an interesting sight.
The bird bites the woody cone off the tree limb, then transfers the cone
to one claw. Grasping the cone firmly, it proceeds to tear off the husk to
expose the seeds which it then eats. While doing so, this cockatoo shows
the efficacy of the foot structure as a hand " for the manipulation oi
objects.
The Black Cockatoo is also another specialized feeder. In addition
to eating seeds, blossoms, nectar, fruits, nuts and berries, this large
beautiful species will also seek and eat the larvae of certain insects that are
tree borers.
Landing on a tree, it proceeds to bite off pieces of bark until it reaches
the tunnel underneath in which is the insect grub or larva. The bird seems
to seek particularly the large grubs of some wood moths, Cossidae, and
of some large longicorn beetles, Cerambycidae, known among Australians
as " wichetty grubs However, many of us would like to know how the
black cockatoo manages to track down the trees where the larvae are, or
perhaps it happens on to the right tree by accident.
History tells us that the first Australian parrot described by Europeans
was probably the Little Corella which was mentioned by the English

adventurer, William Dampier, in his journals dating back to 22nd August
1699. He saw these white birds on islands of now the Dampier Archi-
pelago in north-western Australia.
The Little Corella is one of the most abundant species. Recently, an
observer in north-western Australia watched .flocks which he estimated
to number between 60 to 70,000 birds. An interesting point about this
species is that it often mates with the Galah. Galah-Corella hybrids are
trapped in the wild from time to time and they are also known to be
produced in aviaries. The genetic combinations of these two species
produce a bird that is usually like the Galah, complete with the Galah's
grey, pink-rose plumage, but it has the characteristic bluish-purplish eye
ring of the Corella.
Most Australian parrots breed in hollow trees or similar spots and the
hens produce white eggs. There is one parrot, however, that appears to
make a nest in the tree hollow, a habit that is not known for other Australian
species. This is the turquoise parrot, a splendid bird that is no longer
&apos;j abundant, and which occurs in eastern Australia. One bird was seen
recently stripping green leaves from a tree, placing them under the rump
feathers and carrying them to the nesting site.
Another specialized nester is the Rock Parrot of the coastal regions of
southern and western Australia which is known to lay the eggs in rock
! crevices; and the Ground Parrot, a relatively rare species which occurs in
grasslands of Tasmania and eastern Australia, which makes a shallow
scrape in the ground under grass cover and there lays her eggs.
The two rarest parrots in Australia are the Paradise Parrot and the Night
Parrot. The Paradise Parrot occurred near my home in the Burnett-
Mary river valleys of Queensland and in north-east New South Wales.
The last and only photograph of this bird was taken in 1922 by naturalist
C. H. Jerrard only a few miles from my home and shows the parrot
standing at the foot of a termite mound.
The bird's association with termite mounds concerns nesting sites.
That is, the Paradise Parrot breeds in hollows excavated into termite
mounds where the eggs are laid. The bird was recorded in areas of
savannah or scrubby grasslands with plenty of termite mounds. Although
many expeditions in search of this bird have been carried out, none has
met with success. The last record of this species dates back to 1926
when a party of five was seen near Casino, N.S.W.
But for all that many of my colleagues and I don't believe that the
Paradise Parrot is extinct. This country is too big and too little known
to come to rash conclusions on " extinct species."
A similar rare species is the Night Parrot which has only been recorded
in the inland regions. It is a nocturnal bird, probably chiefly or entirely
a ground feeder and ground dweller. The only specimen positively
identified in this century was obtained in 1937 in the inland. All expedi-
tions in search of this bird have failed but perhaps being a noctural bird
and of highly cryptic habits, it is hard to discover.

But the future of most of our parrots seems to be bright enough. Most
species are protected in some parts of their range, others are protected
throughout the country. Many or all species are bred in aviaries so
ensuring a steady supply of new individuals for, fortunately, most species
breed well in captivity providing that the right quarters and food are
supplied.
And the famous " budgie " which is now acclimatized as a cage pet in
many countries, is still as plentiful as it ever was and still clouds of these
beautiful little birds soar aloft in the bush sky proclaiming the hardiness
of this species, which has become adapted to live and survive in some
of the toughest environments on earth.

BREEDING ROBINS

<bodyText confidence="0.992015392857143" page_id="58076236"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
By Frank Meaden (Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England)
In the Magazine last year C. J. O. Harrison (Harrison, 1969 a , b)
described an attempt to breed robins Erithacus rubecula, which was
thwarted by the aggressiveness of the male parent which killed the young.
When the opportunity arose this year it seemed worthwhile to try it again
under different circumstances, and to compare the results.
The parents in this instance were hand-reared birds from separate nests
which had come to grief in the wild the previous year. They were
presumably unrelated, and were housed in adjoining aviaries in the garden
from the time in 1969 when they became self-supporting to the 1970 breed-
ing season. Each of the aviaries measured some 12 x 6 x 6J ft. high, and
were partly sheltered and covered at the back. They contained a natural
growth of rhododendron, redcurrant, reeds, iris, sedge, blackberry and
honeysuckle, which rather gives the impression of densely overgrown
aviaries; but this was not so for the vegetation was fairly low and confined
to the perimeter of the aviary. The front of the aviaries was partly
sheltered by an apple tree; and at the front, which butts on the garden
path, a hollow log was fixed about four feet up in the female's aviary.
This was placed horizontally with the entrance hole facing east.
The normal daily food consisted of Avi-vite softbill food and finely
grated cheddar cheese, and a ration of maggots powdered with Casilan,
together with whatever else they could find in their enclosures.
Towards the end of March the hen was seen to be frequenting the nest-
log on numerous occasions throughout the day, but only remaining
inside for a few moments during each visit. At this period a pair of wild
robins were seen in the garden. These were believed to be nesting
somewhere in the near vicinity. Constant fighting took place between
the two males, our own bird challenging the wild bird upon each visit.

The challenge would be readily accepted and they would attack each
other while hovering and fluttering vertically up and down the full height
of the enclosure with just the wire between them.
Believing the ist of April to be as good a day as any, the male was, on
this day, placed in the female's enclosure. They were watched, but no
squabbling was observed between them, merely the usual tail-flicking
and an occasional chase with the male stopping a few inches short of the
hen with a little bow and tail flip. By the 5th April a nest had been
commenced, intervals between entering the nest-hole v/ere now far
shorter, and each time a billfull of nesting material, such as dead leaves
or fine grass, was taken into the log. All nest building appeared to be
by the hen at this stage, the male going no further than a quick settling
on the threshold, a peep into the log, and back to his favourite singing
perch.
The hen was sitting tight on five eggs by the 10th April, with the male
singing almost from dawn to dusk in the farthest corner of their enclosure,
only visiting the feeding shelf sited near the nest-log on rare occasions,
and even then taking hardly any food. On 26th April when ASPEBA
held a meeting at our house members were able to observe the newly
deposited broken eggshells which were dropped in a further corner of the
aviary. It was at this time that the male commenced taking food to the
hen. He was in the log for so short a time, hardly disappearing before
re-emerging with the bill empty, that he had too little time to feed the
young.
European Flour-moth larvae in varying stages of growth were now
included in the food, and a bucket of rotting fruit in their enclosure also
attracted a certain amount of insect life, and since part of the enclosure
covered a portion of the garden goldfish pond there may well have been
other insect life taken but not recorded. With the knowledge that young
now existed, we added Calcium Lactate as well to the maggots in an effort
to obviate any deficiency and possible rickets, adding about five drops of
Abidec to the maggots first, so giving them a slight film of the concentrated
vitamin before adding this powder and the Casilan.
Once the crucial five-day stage was passed a daily ration of 20 or so
mealworms were included in the diet. Unlike many other softbills the
robins took most of these to the nest and did not eat them themselves,
although they may have taken just a few. On the 10th May, when four
other aviculturists were present, we slid aside the plastic flap which
covered an observation hole in the log, and found the presence of four
; almost fully feathered nestlings. The wild robin was still visiting the
\ aviary.
The young emerged from the nest on 12th May, leaving one unhatched
! egg. On 15th May one fully feathered but partly decomposed youngster
was removed from the pond. On 17th May the hen was observed to be
nesting again in the same site, the unhatched egg having disappeared and

an almost new nest was completed. No further checks were made on
the new nest but the hen seemed reluctant to begin laying again, and
since the three young were present I wondered if their presence in the
nest area had inhibited the production of a second clutch.
The male wild robin which had continued to visit the garden ceased to
do so after the 18th May The male of the aviary pair appeared to ignore
his offspring once they were feeding themselves and the hen showed
increasing interest in the nest. On the 29th May, when by subsequent
calculation the clutch must have been laid and incubation begun, and
when the young were 17 days out of the nest, the male suddenly turned
on the young ones. Within half an hour of an earlier check he had killed
one young bird, stripping the top of the head and pecking out the eyes,
and a second young one was being attacked. The remaining young were
caught up and removed. The second young one had been pecked about
the head and eyes, but no serious damage was visible and after it had
been treated with an eyewash, and force-fed with five mealworms, it was
back to normal behaviour within minutes, apparently sustaining no shock.
The 10th June saw eggshells once again carried from the nest and on
14th June E. Easter investigated the nest and found that three or four
young had hatched. At the time of writing they are doing well and will
be left with the parents in the enclosure to see if any set pattern is shown
by the male in his reaction to the young.
This method of breeding this species has had greater success than that
described by C. J. O. Elarrison. Factors which might have assisted success
are the introduction of the male to the female's aviary, which might reduce
his initial dominance; and, more important still, the fact that for the
greater part of the nesting cycle a wild male was present and enabled the
aviary male to direct the greater part of his aggressive reaction towards
this outside individual.
Man creates many problems when confining birds and animals in
confined spaces. These should all breed under suitable conditions but
the many barriers that we ourselves erect have to be overcome. When,
one listens to some bird breeders one could be excused for believing that
they might have brooded and reared the clutch themselves; but in actual
fact we do very little apart from reducing the difficulties that we have
created for ourselves in the first place.

By G. Michael Flieg (Brookfield, Illinois, U.S.A.)
Megapodes are a family of game birds restricted to Malaysia, the South-
west Pacific, the Philippines, New Guinea and Australia. The family is
unique in that it constitutes a group of birds which leave the incubation
of their eggs to a natural heat source--solar heat, volcanic heat or the heat
produced by decaying vegetation. Megapod means " big foot " and is
quite appropriate for the io species which rely on their feet for excavation.
Although many have been kept periodically, only the Yellow Wattled
Talegallus or Brush Turkey (Alectura lathami) of Eastern Australia has
bred freely in Europe but until this year none were bred in the Western
Hemisphere. In 1969 the first breeding was accomplished at St. Louis
followed later by San Diego.
In late July 1968, the St. Louis Zoo obtained two pairs of 1967 hatch
birds captive bred in Frankfurt, Germany. They were placed in a large
outdoor exhibit approximately 30 ft. x 20 ft. The birds had access to a
barn and they were always fed inside--their diet consisted of Purina
Game Bird F &amp; M in the fall. In winter, 50% of the above, 25% Trout
Chow No. 4, and 25% small seed. As a breeder ration in the spring and
summer 50% Trout Chow and 50% Game Bird F &amp; M.
Although they had free choice access to the barn--they entered only
to feed or to escape the badgering of the dominant male, although the
outside temperature reached extremes of io* F. Peat moss was supplied
to the birds from the beginning. It was piled into a corner of the enclo-
sure, but w r as immediately moved away from these obstacles by the male
and a mound took form. No further material was supplied until breeding
behaviour was noted in the summer. It was at this period when the sub-
dominant male had to be removed as the colour of the head and wattles of
the dominant bird intensified as he came into breeding condition. He
simply would not let the other male alone and pursued him constantly.
The male alone took care of the mound and he would not tolerate the
presence of the hens on the mound, except for brief intervals. It was also
at this time that all loose material went into the pile. Although we added
more peat moss--feathers, droppings, debris from the yard and shavings
from the barn were incorporated into the mound. The mound finally
grew to 15 ft. in diameter and 3J ft. high. It was at this time that we
decided that the mound wasn't decomposing quickly enough to produce
heat and three bushels of Bison dung were added to the core. Heat was
produced almost immediately and the decomposition of the other organic
material began. I he male must keep a relatively constant temperature in
the mound. His thermometer is his wattles or tongue, therefore, he must
open the mound in the morning to let it cool off; as the sun warms the
mound it is covered over to prevent excess heat from entering, but if it is a

cool day it is left open. At evening it is shovelled back together again to
seal the heat in. This process also allows for any new collected materials
to be fully incorporated into the mound. 1 o the casual observer it
appears as if he is tearing it apart and putting it back together. Although
the Brush Turkey is considered monogamous, the presence of two hens
had no effect and the trio lived in harmony, but I suspect from the total
number of eggs that only one hen laid.
The hens' feathers were broken and frazzled indicating that the male
either persecuted or copulated with them. Copulation was not witnessed,
but I rather believe that it occurred in the early morning as the male
worked all day on the mound. Although we searched religiously for
eggs, we did not find any until 15th August when a clutch of 14 were
found buried about 2 ft. below the surface, standing vertically on end and
were spaced roughly 6 in. apart Some eggs were found in a layer beneath
the others. The earliest eggs were closest to the centre as ascertained
by candling. They were laid in roughly a 30* wedge of the circum-
ference of the mound. The interval between eggs in the species is
approximately 5--7 days (Lack 1968) indicating the first egg may have
been laid in late June. The incubation period is variable depending upon
the heat of the mound, but is recorded at normally 47-52 days (Baltin and
Faust 1965). This, of course, depends upon the actual heat of the mound.
The eggs are very large in relation to other birds eggs, the egg weight being
approximately 12% that of the hen. Of course, the birds hatch at a
highly advanced stage in comparison to other birds. Upon candling the
eggs, five were removed and placed into a still air incubator at 93 F.
This temperature was selected after reading an account published by the
Frankfurt Zoo (Baltin and Faust 1965).
The eggs were placed upright and covered with damp peat moss. The
eggs are never turned in the mound when tended by the male and the
unique egg, about the size of that of a Canada Goose, contains a moveable
air bubble. The first egg was a heartbreak as the chick broke the paper
thin shell, but couldn't break the damp membrane and died. The second .
hatched on 17th August and was placed into a game bird hatcher to dry
I believe the 99U F. was too hot for it and it died after six hours. I believe
that this is the first megapode to be hatched in a mechanical incubator
although Frankfurt hatched birds in an aquarium with decaying leaves.
It was interesting to note that the position of the chick within the egg as
they have no egg tooth and simply use their feet to kick out of the egg,
therefore, they are upside down in relation to other birds. After hatching
in the mound the chick must dig his way to the surface which takes
24-30 hours. Artificially hatched chicks at Frankfurt as well as the St.
Louis chicks were unable to right themselves until about 24 hours old,
probably because they lie on their backs and kick to excavate out.
The first chick hatched from the mound appeared in the yard on 21st
August. It was removed immediately and placed in a wire commercial

megapode chick, the latter became quite passive and did not appear
comfortable. This was received as an indication that the chick did not
feel at ease with a companion as he normally would take care of himself
after hatching and lead a rather solitary existence. We removed the
junglefowl and the Brush Turkey became very active, feeding on  |Game
Purina Bird F &amp; M and J Purina Trout Chow with LIV sprinkled on
top. Twice daily some crickets were offered and received with relish.
W hen hatched megapode chicks have fully developed remiges and
are capable of flight; they are covered with grey coloured down with an
orange tint on the head and neck. They are larger than peafowl at
hatching. After the young hatch, the parents have no further contact
with them although they apparently do not harm them. A statement that
the cock digs the chicks into the pile for a few nights is unconfirmed, but
chicks can dig themselves out again after leaving the pile if they are
reburied. According to Frankfurt data, after hatching, chicks lose
35% of their egg weight, and 40% when they reach the top of the pile.
After 3-4 weeks the other feathers grow and the weight triples--after
four months the birds reach 60 *q of their weight and are full grown within
a year.
By December 1969 the St. Louis bird was about 3^ months old and was
about 85% grown. This breeding was accomplished while I was Curator
of Birds, St. Louis Zoological Gardens.

Pesquet or Pecquet. Lesson in 1831 named this parrot Psittacus
Pecquetii, the account stating that he had received the specimen from
M. Pecquet. Later in the same year he spelled the name Psittacus
Pesquetii. We are, therefore, left wondering which is really the correct
spelling. Pesquet is now generally accepted, although Pecquet, possibly
incorrect, does, of course, have priority.

Why Quelea? C. J. Skead, Bokmakierie, March, 1970, 3 , asks this very
pertinent question.
In 1758 Carl Linnaeus named the Red-billed Weaver Emberiza quelea.
It is generally supposed that quelea has its origin in some African language.
But when would, or could, Linnaeus have got the name? Perhaps one of
our more erudite members can elucidate.

Phillip Glasier, The Falconry Centre, writes (18th May): " We have
had 10 clutches from nine different species so far this year. At the moment
on eggs we have Lanners, Red-tailed Buzzards, Common Buzzards,
Kestrels (we reared six last year), American Kestrels, Tawny Owls, Bay
Owls and Merlins. Our Caracaras laid eggs but though fertile they failed
to hatch."

Dr. L. A. Swaenepoel, Lembeek, Belgium (5th May): " The second
nest of the Bronze-winged Parrots (Pionus chalcopterus) was also infertile.
We were very unlucky with the three eggs of Ringnecks, by the parents
of the albino. They were entrusted to a normal hen who left them while-
hatching. None of the chicks was red-eyed.
" We have a few Mulgas and Blue Bonnets, and we hope to raise a
few Green Rosellas, as well as dilute Golden-mantled."

An item from Peterborough's column, Daily Telegraph , 19th May
1970: " Thrush a la carte. How Italian ideas on sport differ from ours
was apparent yesterday at a show of products from Pisa and Lucca at
the Italian Trade Centre in Mayfair. On show was a clockwork gadget
(a battery-operated version also is available) that imitates the calls ol
blackbirds and thrushes. One of a number of bird-ensnaring devices,
it is said to work like magic, pulling in the victims as fast as they can be
shot and skewered for roasting."

Down the years exhibitors have done very well with Choughs. The
same cannot be said of aviculturists. The difficulty being, I imagine,
that aviculturists have only very occasionally been able to obtain pairs
I am reminded of this by the fact that Choughs at the Riber Castle Fauna
Reserve and Wildlife Park have recently produced five eggs. I do not
think anyone has been completely successful in rearing this species,
although Claude Payne came near to success in 1967, when one young
one lived a fortnight or so.

Arthur and Catherine Pyler, Oakland, New Jersey, state that experience
has shown them that Jendaya Conures will, if allowed, breed approxi-
mately every four months. They write: "We let them have three
clutches, three eggs on each occasion. The first produced two young,
the second three and the third but one, although all the eggs were fertile.
The last was hand-fed from a few weeks old and so we have a very tame,
sweet pet bird. Jendayas do, however, have a very lusty voice which
some people might find unbearable."

George and Bessie Bray, San Francisco: " Last year we had two unusual
breedings. An African Silverbill crossed with a female Bengalese
(Society) Finch. There was only one young one, a male that looks like an
overgrown African Silverbill, but with a darker beak and darker facial area.
He in turn mated with an African Silverbill, but as far as we can tell
, without result. Maybe he is a mule! We also had a Green Singing
Finch cross with a Yellow-rumped Grey Singing Finch hen. Two
beautiful young ones which turned out quite rufous in colour."

It is reported in Oryx, May, 1970, 243, that Dr. Rodolfo E. Gonzales
is of the opinion that the total population of the Monkey-eating Eagle of
Mindanao Island, Philippines (the Eagles only home) is now only about
36 birds, certainly less than 50.
It is perhaps worth recalling that this Eagle (.Pithecophaga jefferi) was
named for a near relative of a former Vice-President of the Society,
! the late Edward Boosey. The type-specimen was obtained by John
Whitehead during his successful expedition to the Philippines, 1894-97.
At the collector's request it was named after his father, Jeffery Whitehead,
grandfather to Edward Boosey.

Dr. Maurice Burton, Daily Telegraph, 7th March 1970, says it is very

Before electrification, the steam train on Ryde pier, belching smoke,
always had its attendant flock of gulls that accompanied it the length of

1969 was a very good year for Gentoo Penguins at the Edinburgh Zoo;
18 young were reared from 24 eggs hatched; on the other hand only one
King was successfully reared
One of the most interesting events was the rearing to maturity of three
young from four eggs hatched by the pair of American Kestrels Falco
sparverius).
The Cassowaries have laid eggs annually since 1965; on four occasions
eggs have been hatched. Last year three eggs were laid; one proved
infertile but the other two produced healthy chicks. One young one
unaccountably disappeared, so only one was reared. This makes a total
of five reared during the last three years.

Mrs. K. M. Scamell (28th May): "Our Quaker Babblers Alcippe
horocephala have hatched two young, probably two days ago. I cannot
trace that this species has been bred before. The late spring has resulted
in late nesting everywhere, except the hen Cock-of-the-Rock Rupicola
peruviana sanguinolenta , which started building last February and laid an
egg about a week ago. She incubated about a week and then either she
or the male knocked it out of the nest.
" Lemon-rumped Tanagers Ramphocelus icteronotus and Rothschild's
Mynas are incubating two and three eggs respectively, and the Indian
Blue Chats have one egg. Other softbills are building, so it is rather early
to say whether it is going to be a good season or not."
# # *
Mrs. Leila Leitch: " This year I have been very successful with Pygmy
Cardinals Lophospingus pusillus and have reared five, one by hand. The
Zosterops are incubating eggs for the fifth time. On the first three
occasions the cock destroyed the eggs after a few days. At the fourth
sitting five young ones were hatched and both parents fed the chicks at
frequent intervals with fruit flies, bread and milk, honey-sponge and
finally chopped mealworms. This parental care and enthusiasm con-
tinued for four days, but on the fifth morning I found all the young had
been tossed from the nest. The hen appeared somewhat distressed for a
short while that day but soon recovered, and within a week was relining
the same nest and is at present (nth May) incubating four eggs which
are due to hatch this weekend. Both are taking turns in incubating the
eggs. We shall keep the birds under close observation and may remove
the male when the eggs are hatched."

G. A. Smith writes: " Two or three years ago a small consignment of
Malayan Long-tailed Parrakeets Psittacula longicauda were imported,
and a few more last year. As with all the ' Psittaculines 5 cock birds
seem to have preponderated. My own ' hen ' moulted out to become such
another. This young bird I exchanged for the only hen--despite my
; advertisements I could muster. And then she, on receipt, seemed
strongly to favour one foot--always standing on the other. Needless to
add this resolved itself to be severe frost bite. They seem to be just as
; hardy as other members of their genus: Bedford found them otherwise.
When frightened, and they are most suspiciously nervous birds, they sleek
L ^eir feathers very close to the body. Consequently, the otherwise
unnoticed (because such movements take place under cover of the
feathers) abdominal respiratory movements become most pronounced.
And if particularly scared the increased respiratory rate then becomes
audible and may, to the uninitiated, seem ' pneumonic '. I had hoped
to try to get them to breed. Unfortunately, they are supposed to nest in
January or February in the wild. At present the cock is in a profound
moult.
At the moment (28th April) I have New Zealands on eggs, and three
other pairs, I hope, thinking about it. My Many-colours have only laid
three eggs, one of which is infertile. So Fve fostered them off with
. Redrumps and hope that they will have a more ' generous * forced second
round. Lutino Cockatiels, all four pairs, have eggs. If only, in bird
breeding, one could count chicks before they hatch! "

pheasants in the world is being maintained. The so-called progress of
civilization resulting in the destruction of tropical and sub-tropical forest

to be in danger of disappearing from the world. Fortunately the Pheasant

NOTES ON PARAKEETS AND SEEDEATERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998733219512195" page_id="58076246"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
Last autumn, owing to the impossibility of obtaining labour to help with the
glasshouses I had to cut down considerably on my collection of birds. In parakeets
my interest in the main has now been concentrated on my favourites, the Kings, and
Princess of Wales. Both species have confounded all my expectations, because of
the spartan diet to which I was forced to subject them during last winter and
spring, by producing large broods. In the past I have been able to practice what
I consider good animal husbandry by giving all sorts of foods, and supplements,
to bring them into breeding condition. This year they had a bare dry seed diet
from November to April. Nest-boxes were only put in the flight in the second
week of May, at which time I also put in large quantities of chickweed. I he
breeding results were the best ever.
The seedeaters in my planted aviaries have brought pleasure and sorrow. I he
Red-faced Crimson-wing Cryptospiza reichenowi, of which I wintered two males
and a female in an unheated aviary, early in May (to my great surprise as I had
no idea young were in the nest) had three young fly when A. V. Griffiths, who was
down on holiday, put his finger in the nest. One young one, a male, is still very
much alive but the other two died. Also, I am sorry to say, the only hen, the
mother, was also lost. She and one of her young were picked up from the aviary
floor badly mutilated about the head, by, I suspect, a Magpie which later took
all of a brood of Blackbirds which had nested in the honeysuckle which covers
these aviaries. These Crimson-wings must be very hardy.
Members of the African Serins, of which I have several species, have nested.
The St. Helena Seedeater, Serinus flaviventris, produced one young after three
nests, all of which collapsed. White-bellied Seedeaters, S. f. dorsostriatus , have
two young flying. Also, at the moment, two races of Yellow-rumped Serins,
S. atrogularis xanthopygius from Eritrea, and S. a. reichenowi from East Africa
are both nesting. Two races of the more typical type of S. atrogularis from
South Africa have made no attempt at nesting as yet. Only one of the four race S
has the black throat. The Eritrean bird is placed with atrogularis in the books
but I feel that this must be a mistake. Song and behaviour is so different. All
these are delightful little birds, no trouble, and industrious charming songsters,
among which great confusion is caused by the various dealers names.
While some live food might have been obtained in the aviaries I was in no position
to find the time to give them the attention as to feeding that the various experts
expound. I found the Cryptospiza need, like the Twinspot with which they have
a great affinity, lots of live food to get them going when newly imported; so it is
surprising that my birds brought off a normal nest of three young with the only
greenfly and the chickweed supplied by A. V. Griffiths during the short time that
he was here. .
I am aware that the St. Helena Seedeaters have been bred on several occasions
but have come across no reports of breeding of the Red-faced Crimson-wing,

RARE AND VANISHING AMAZONA PARROTS

To the November-December, 1969, number of the Avicultural Magazine
I contributed a short note with the above title. Unfortunately though, I omitted
an important sentence, which made for ambiguity. . The figure of half a million
birds referred to all species of Amazon basin parrots, not only to the genus Amazona
Despite this lapse I was more than a little surprised that anyone should interpret
it to mean that half a million birds of all species were imported into this country
annually. I he figure was intended to apply to the U.S.A. only, and not to this
country. A widely-read weekly publication suggested that the estimate was a
fantastic exaggeration , and asked " Can anyone honestly think that 500000
Amazons were taken? An answer is half a million Amazona Parrots, No*
halt a million bouth American parrots and parrakeets, YES.
I cannot claim any great knowledge of the bird trade as operated at present
but I have vivid recollections of several large consignments of parrots, mainly
'Roseate Cockatoos, Lovebirds and Ring-necked Parrakeets arriving in a deplorable
state, many of the birds being either dead or dying shortly after arrival in England.
Perhaps I am prejudiced but I, for one, can well-believe that for every live South
American parrot sold in an American pet shop 50 have died, for one reason or

another.
j Christopher W eathersbee, after a close study of what he describes as the " Amazon
Parrot Raid, has made known some of his findings in Science News, 4th January
11969, and Peruvian Times, 21st November 1969. The following are extracts,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.85610696969697" page_id="58076247"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
pince the lifting of the Parrot Ban in the U.S.A. in 1967 it has been quite a fad
:o own a parrot of some kind. Pet shops have been selling them as a " novelty "
As fast as they can obtain them. A buyer for F. W. Woolworth, a chain that does a
teignificant portion of the nation's pet selling, says the demand is such that birds
v-annot be captured fast enough to satisfy it. The prices range up to $50.00 each
ind average between $30.00 and $20.00 Weathersbee says: " The South American
parrots are collected in the forests by Indians, who bring them to the nearest
iverbank. There they are purchased for a few cents by buyers who cruise up
md down the river until they have a boatload. The survivors of the boatload
ire sold to the Bogota centre or abroad."
One of the things that has conservationists upset about the parrot trade is that
here may be very few such survivors. It has been estimated that for every live
oird sold in an American pet shop, 50 have died. Many are killed during collec-
ton, either by rough handling or in order to reach the coveted young Many
nore die in cages waiting for the buyer at the river, and the toll continues after the
entrepreneur as acquired his charges. Thus to satisfy a demand for 10,000 pet
&amp;gt;arrots (in the neighborhood of the number imported in the past year) as many as
ialt a million birds may have been destroyed."
Dr. Maria Buchinger, Head of the Latin America Desk of the Nature Con-
servancy, says a side effect of the animal trade is the subversion of the backwoods
ndians economy. What happens, she says, is that the buyers will patronize a
particular section of the river while the parrots are plentiful there. For a few
aonthL or a couple of years some of the Indians will earn a tiny amount which
9 ey nevertheless consider good, easy money. In the meanwhile they will neglect
3 maintain their farms and other traditional means of living, so marginal as a rule
aat they can stand little neglect. Then the birds become scarce from the over-
unting and the buyers move on, leaving the Indians with neither crop, cash
1&lt; T? r ^. e ' savin S s nor any long-term benefit from their collecting.
&apos; Robert Neeley, a former hunting guide in Colombia who now refuses to take
i nything but photographic parties, says such disruption of tribal affairs, plus the
! 3n sciousness that foreigners are hunting out vital native game supplies, has made
! &amp;gt;any Indian chieftains ardent conservationists. There are still enough Indians

<bodyText confidence="0.99956815" page_id="58076248"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
I was interested in the correspondence in the Avicultural Magazine about
feeding parrots. As you may know I have kept a small collection of cockatoos for
about 20 years and have bred a few most years. One citron-crest hen has reared
almost every year for about 15 years and roseates have performed similarly. My
birds receive adequate attention but not as much as I could sometimes wish..
As your correspondents indicate very little if any controlled experimentation
has been carried out on the diets of cage-birds--such work is extremely expensive
apart from anything else--but one can assume a few general principles, e.g. that
a bird can't produce protein from carbohydrate without nitrogen, and as a con-
sequence a diet of low-protein grain is not likely to be sufficient for breeding
birds--and there is, of course a very great amount of information about the diet
of domestic poultry. Pheasant breeders have cashed in directly on this information
and, as many appreciate, turkey starter crumbs supply an excellent supplementary
diet for many species of birds.
I have always supplied my cockatoos with supplements to a basic grain diet
and these include hard-boiled egg, bread and milk and a variety of household
scraps including cooked meat scraps and bones including ham bones. It is fairly
certain that a breeding pair feels the need for meat and I believe that many years
ago I reported in the Magazine how a citron-crest hen used to catch and eat
sparrows. Feather plucking is a terrible thing and it is quite certain that nobody
knows how to cure it. Of the four species I have kept, Leadbeaters and roseates
have never plucked, citrons occasionally and the Timor race of the Lesser sulphur-
crest, badly. It must be appreciated that like most others I am speaking of what
in a statistical sense is a very small number of birds. Plucking seems to be ot
two kinds, the mild (particularly breast) plucking which I am inclined to associate
with some sort of frustration in the breeding cycle and I have had a breeding pair
suddenly and for no apparent reason wreck themselves in a day, subsequently
recover and never do it again and the chronic type which I am inclined to believe
starts in a caged bird from boredom but subsequently fails to respond to anything
including liberty or freedom in an aviary with a breeding partner.
There may be cases where plucking is associated with ecto-parasites or with
diet but I believe the major cause is psychological. By analogy some of the worst
of this type of behaviour is seen in the intensive poultry and pig units (tail biting)
and it is extremely difficult to believe that diet is involved here.
I was delighted to see the notes about feeding lories and lorikeets. My
experience is limited to Swainson's which is reputed to be the easiest, but with
them I certainly have had no trouble at all. I have two breeding pairs that produce
one or two young with unfailing regularity and I have a colony (eight birds) which
has its first baby ready to fledge. Essentially they get a basic diet of a pint of
full-cream milk between them with a home made nectar addition of equal parts of
Farex, runny honey and sweetened condensed milk with a liberal addition of
ordinarv white sugar. Sunflower seed is supplied ad lib. and the milk-nectar
mixture has a large piece of bread put in it which the birds eat or waste. They
get very little fruit except in the apple season. Grapes are by repute such an
indifferent food that it seems hardly worthwhile. During the winter I occasionally
give cod-liver oil or some of the household orange concentrate with a reputed
vitamin A and C content. I give them bits of meat and bones at times and would
think it a good idea: I have given egg on occasion. Presumably they get most ol
their protein from the milk. The historical difficulty of keeping the group alive is
interesting because it seemed to apply to Swainson's as well as the other species
that I would fully accept as being much more difficult. I have never seen the
condition described as " fits " but Tom Spence told me he had been called in tc
attend to a Swainson's Lorikeet so suffering and that it had responded miraculously
to an injection with vitamin B--12 (if I am misquoting him he will, I'm sure, le
us know). The bird may, of course, have reacted to having a needle stuck in it
Having had some association with Tom's big collection of lories in Scotland
which included such exotic things as the Black Lory I developed a mistrust of thei
capacity for survival which is only now mildly fading with my experience of nr
Swainson's. Mr. Murray's experiences with the Yellow-backs is encouraging ant

TOOL-USING BY BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9438096875" page_id="58076249"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
I don't know as to whether tool-using has been described in birds other than
the Galapagos Woodpecker Finch ( Camarhynchos pallidus ) which many of us may
have seen on a Television film. The bird uses a beak-held twig to give an
extension of its bill to probe insects from cracks and crannies. And certain
Bower-birds, for example the Satin Bower-bird ( Ptilonorhynchus violaced), use
deeply-staining, burst berries as paint brushes to decorate their bowers. Recently
I have seen a Bare-eyed Cockatoo ( Cacatua sanguined) which when offered a dead
matchstick would hold it in the claw and quite deliberately, though admittedly
with little facility, use it to scratch (poke might be the more descriptive word) the
throat area immediately under and posterior to the base of the lower mandible.
It did this in a dreamy sort of ecstatic way as would be expected if it gave the bird
the same sort of physical satisfaction as stroking or mutual preening would. Not
every proference of a matchstick was so treated for if the bird was lively or excited
it would chew them up. I suppose that Mr. Sidney Porter's account of his Keas
[ which would, if given a tin, use it to bale out any container of water, is an even
better illustration of the use of a tool by a parrot.

On page 77 of the section, " News and Views " of Volume 76 of your Avicultural
Magazine, is an excerpt from the Los Angeles Times implying that I was insulted
at being classed as an aviculturist and that I said "An aviculturist is a zoo keeper ''.
The paragraph also contained an admonition to me to bear in mind the past
contributions of aviculturists.
For the record, I should like to categorically deny having made the remarks
attributed to me, or any other comments that might be even remotely construed
to imply disparagement of aviculture or zoo keeping. During the interview on
. which this article was based, I was somewhat concerned that the reporter took
very few written notes and persistently asked leading questions obviously intended
to evoke controversy. The same technique apparently was followed in inter-
. viewing another individual mentioned in the article, resulting in a tart letter from
him denying several assertions contained in the story. I, too, prepared a letter
intended to correct the record, but was asked by higher authority not to send it
because (1) my objections were likely to be considered trivial by the editor of the
publication in which the story first appeared, (2) the corrections would not reach
the several other newspapers in which it was reprinted, and (3) the story, on the
' whole, was favorable to our program.
The zoo personnel and private aviculturists with whom we work, many of whom
are close friends, know my high respect for their contributions to the art of animal-
keeping and breeding. We have borrowed extensively from their literature, as
well as from their undocumented stores of knowledge. Our veterinarian was a
member of the Lincoln Park Zoo before joining our program, and two of our
technicians formerly were with the National Zoological Park. We have utilized
the counsel of aviculturists in propagation building design and the services of
others in the breeding of certain species for which we have no facilities. My

staff and I are in frequent contact with them for mutually valuable exchanges of
other information, and we have provided stock of rare and endangered species
to a number of them on indefinite loan. As active participants, we attend several
meetings each year that are devoted exclusively or in part to the care of wildlife
species in captivity, and our Station is visited annually by dozens of avicultunsts,
zoo administrators, and technicians from this and other countries, including
England.
Happily, the great preponderance of newspaper and magazine story coverage
of our project has been objectively, understandably, and quite accurately written,
and since staff and facility limitations do not allow us to encourage public visitation
we appreciate this means of informing the many interested individuals and
organizations of our activities. However, working as we do with a most interesting
and emotionally charged subject, our disappearing wildlife species, we will predict
with reasonable certainty that additional misinterpretations of our objectives and
remarks will take place in the coming months and years. Whenever events of that
nature again raise questions or doubts regarding this program or the reported
utterances of its staff, we would welcome the opportunity to reply to the situation
before a judgment is reported in your magazine.
Unfortunately, quotations in the press sometimes are used extremely loosely
or even erroneously by some writers, and anyone who has had even infrequent
exposure to interviewing is chagrined at liberties that are taken in reproducing
the spoken word. A very good friend who also is a zoo director, when I called to
comment upon the article mentioned above, may have summed up the situation
best by saying the following (or words to that effect): " Your friends know the
remarks were inaccurate, but count your blessings. At least they spelled your

THE BLACK-HEADED BUSH SHRIKE

Shrikes consist of three sub-families of the family Laniidae. To the
average European or North American interested in birds, the true shrikes
of the genus Lanius are the best known. They extend in range over Europe,
Asia, Indonesia, Africa and North America and are familiar to many in
the wild state. They look like miniature birds of prey, although true
passerine birds. Few aviculturists keep them in captivity as they cannot
f be associated with other birds on account of their murderous instincts.
! They are, however, handsome and interesting, and some have a pretty
song. They are fed mostly on meat and do not present special problems.
The other two families inhabit Africa only. The Helmeted Shrikes
(Prionopinae) are completely insectivorous, and harmless to other birds.
Some beautiful species have been kept successfully in aviaries. The
 |Bush Shrikes (Malaconotinae) are represented throughout Africa by
; numerous species of several genera. A number of them are very beautiful
i and fairly often kept in zoos and private aviaries, particularly the brightly
coloured ones, such as certain species of Laniarius with much crimson in
their plumage. Several genera are composed of insectivorous birds which
are not too dangerous to other birds. Such is the case of the Black-
headed Bush Shrike depicted on the accompanying plate. It is not gaudily
j coloured, but its sombre pattern is elegant. This species is the only one
of the whole sub-family represented in Mediterranean Africa, as one
sub-species ( culcullata ) is found locally in thick bush in the coastal districts
of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Numerous others are found throughout
Africa. It is a shy bird, difficult to detect in the thickets, except when,
in the spring, if comes out in a nuptial flight. It feeds almost entirely on
beetles.
This Bush Shrike sings very well. It has, however, seldom been kept
in captivity.

My pair of imported Pigmy Cardinals was purchased from a friend
who is a dealer, and introduced into a small planted aviary with heated
shelter, where they settled happily with a collection of mixed small foreign
seed-eaters.
At the time, midsummer 1968, I was inexperienced in aviculture and
did not know of the difficulties experienced by some breeders in success-
fully rearing the young of this species. Consequently I was gravely
concerned that only one from each of the first two broods in 1969 survived,
and became independent. Having followed all available information to the
letter, I was particularly strict in the rationing of mealworms, but only in
this season have I had true success having six healthy and hardy youngsters
in the aviary.
The breeding notes which I have made are as follows:

The pair chose a site well screened, where there was a hand-made
basket of finch-basket size but with two entrances. The site was in the
inside flight where light, heat and a reasonable humidity prevailed. In
the basket the hen constructed a very small fragile nest of hemp and sheeps'
wool. Here she laid her two eggs, grey/green and brownish spotted, and
these she incubated for exactly twelve days while the cock sang sweetly.
After the first nesting a replica of the first nest was built in the same basket
beside the other; these have been used alternately throughout the season
and are still in a spotless condition.

The hen did all the incubating but the cock was ever attentive, bringing
her morsels from time to time and conducting her to and from the feeding
station in the short periods she spent off the nest. Only when the hen
was off the nest did he show aggression towards other birds, apart from
normal defence of the site.

became active and noisy in their demands for food.

due to strict rationing of high-protein mealworms. A more generous
supply produced healthy vital growth.

For the first day the hen took to her brood crumbled hard-boiled egg
and soft cheese mixed with Abidec. Thereafter both parents brought
food to the nest. The diet offered was as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989501333333333" page_id="58076267"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
(1) Mealworms: The parents fed the contents of two mealworms per
nestling every hour on days two, three, four and five. The quantity was
then increased and the chicks were given the entire worm. By the time
they were fledged and left the nest on the twelfth day, they were fed ten
. mealworms each several times a day. This assessment is accurate as both

rather than collect the food from the feeding station.
I hesitated and doubted the prudence of my generosity, but I can only
comment that when mealworms were rationed the young died, the
parents giving all available food to one chick only.

<listItem confidence="0.936388416666667" page_id="58076267"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
(ii) Gentles: These were always available as alternative live food,
but the parents gave them sparingly, although once independent the young
took them readily.
(iii) Proprietary soft foods, insectivorous mixtures etc.: The parents
used these but rarely although they were observed to feed upon them
themselves while saving the live food for the young.
(iv) Fruit flies: A culture of fruit flies was maintained but these were
not taken to the nestlings. When independent the young birds enjoyed
the fruit flies.
(v) Sponge, mixed with honey, beef extract, rose-hip syrup, Cytacon,
md water: This has proved an excellent food factor in the healthy develop-
ment of all my young birds, not least the Pigmy Cardinals. The parents

j took the mixture to the nestlings at regular intervals, it was the first food
 |fledglings took for themselves, and I hand reared one ailing baby Pigmy
cardinal with this mixture and other diet mentioned here.
This chick learned to feed from forceps and grew to be quite vigorous,
)ut it had a poor sense of balance and unhappily drowned in the aviary
)ath after five months of independent living.
(vi) Soft cheese " salad ": This was used by the parents, and in the
;iand rearing. It comprises cottage cheese, finely-chopped egg, grated
Pple, Bemax, and finely-chopped lettuce or water-cress. I may add that
his is popular with other parent birds, and with all birds in the aviary.

almost exclusively at first, he also taught them to eat the sponge mixture,
and trained them to eat softened millet spray and to pick up grit.
Incidentally, as I had read, he showed a preference for one chick each
time and was grudging in his maintenance of the other. In a brood of
three he killed the strongest of the chicks before I could come to the
rescue. I understand that he is supposed to favour the young cocks;
certainly one chick in each pair tends to sit beside mother while she
incubates her eggs, the other goes exploring with the cock. Once indepen-
dent the young develop at an equal rate and it is impossible to determine
whether " father's favourite " was the young cock.

5. General Observation.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998481052631579" page_id="58076268"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Only once have I seen evidence of the young being plucked in readiness
for a new nest to be lined. On this occasion a plentiful supply of sheep's
wool distracted parental attention from the downy breast feathers of the
young.
When the newest nestlings became more demanding the cock drove the
independent youngsters out into the flight. He was never over-aggressive,
but the youngsters were disturbed by the behaviour and were removed from
the flight to the independent existence of a separate flight. This rejection
is at four to five weeks after they leave the nest.
The young birds I have in my collection live together quite happily and
although they show true Pigmy Cardinal self assertion in establishing
themselves high in the pecking order, they only evolve their order among
themselves according to age. This process has yet to be observed when
they come into breeding condition. This I believe is at about nine to
twelve months.
Unfortunately my aviary conditions are so limited that I will be unable
to keep all my young Pigmy Cardinals, although I shall make every effort
to develop a strain of aviary bred birds, by retaining some of my own young
birds and introducing new stock from time to time.

By R. Unwin Lambert (Reigate, Surrey, England)
In March of this year I purchased a pair of three-week-old Japanese
Quail, Coturnix japonica , and placed them in a small aviary having a
ground measurement of 6 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft., in company with a pair of Chinese
; Painted Quail, Excalfactoria chinensis. The aviary has an earth floor and
although it was planted with a selection of herbaceous plants the majority
of these were stripped as soon as they started to grow. Although the
aviary has a small hut in which the birds can shelter they have not yet used
ft preferring to sit-out in the rain. As the aviary is, however, well
jjdrained the birds have not come to any harm; but no doubt other arrange-
ments will have to be made later in the year.
The quail (both species) are fed on a mixture of high protein turkey
starter crumbs, pannicun and white millet. At first this mixture was
given in a ratio of 50% starter crumbs, 30% pannicum and 20% white
millet. This mixture has now, however, been changed, for reasons given
later, to a ratio of 30% starter crumbs, 40% pannicum and 30% white
millet. In addition a plentiful supply of grit and greenfoods are given;
the Japanese Quail preferring greenfoods more than the Chinese Painted
Quail, and in both species the hen has a higher preference for it than the
cock bird.
When they were approximately seven weeks old the Japanese Quail
laid their first egg in a small scrape in one corner of the aviary, the scrape
being about six inches in diameter and an inch deep in the centre. Subse-
quent eggs being laid at a rate of one per day. At no time, however, have
the cock or hen showed any inclination to incubate the eggs; on the contrary
the eggs were often rolled out of the scrape to a distance of a few feet away
 |aR d then abandoned. At this stage I decided to purchase a small incubator
1 which were placed eight eggs. At the same time two eggs were placed
under a Barbary Dove, Streptopelia roseogrisea " risoria ", her own eggs
being removed. Although my pair of Barbary Doves, which are kept in
mother aviary, lay and incubate their own eggs regularly no eggs have
yet been hatched.
The incubator proved unreliable from the start as it was very difficult
.0 maintain the correct temperature and it was not surprising therefore
hat after the incubation period (approx. 18 days) no eggs were hatched.
)n inspection fifty per cent of the eggs showed some development of the
embryo. However the two eggs being incubated by the Barbary Doves
W latched successfully; the first egg after 19 days, the second a day later.
The chicks were immediately removed and placed in a small box which

was heated by a 60 watt electric light bulb placed inside an earthenware
flower pot. At nights the top of the box was covered with a piece of
underfelt.
As soon as they had dried out the chicks began to feed on finely ground
turkey starter crumbs and by the end of the first week their size had more
than trebled. Over the following two weeks I gradually reduced the
amount of heat given until I judged that the chicks were big and fit enough
to go into the outside quail aviary. A certain amount of bullying was
shown towards them by the adults, but after a few days they were ignored
except for the occasional chasing.
I now depend solely on the Barbary Doves for hatching the quails eggs
and at the time of writing these notes in July two more Japanese Quails
and one Chinese Painted Quail have been hatched (the C.P.Q. having the
same tendency to abandon their eggs), and are at present being reared
before being placed outside.
Obviously there are drawbacks to hatching quail's eggs in this way, the
main one being that the doves cannot or will not incubate more than two
Japanese and two Chinese Painted Quails eggs at the same time. Also of
course the doves may lose interest and abandon the eggs before they are
hatched.
In order to help reduce the number of eggs being laid, which were
beginning to show signs of being thin-shelled, I changed the food mixture
as outlined earlier in these notes, hoping that the reduction of the high
protein starter crumbs would help reduce the number of eggs being laid,
but this has not yet proved successful. Apart from this food mixture I have
found that the Japanese Quails have a passion for mealworms, and I am
now able to hand feed the original pair of birds purchased. I have found
however that the female eats a larger proportion of the mealworms than
Fig. 1
the male. When the male is given a worm he holds it, with lowered head,
in his beak uttering soft "croaking" noises (see Fig. 1). The female
then immediately dashes up and accepts or takes the mealworm from the
male, who then copulates or attempts to copulate with the female. Copula- !
tion takes place by the male jumping onto the female's back, his legs on the |
rear of the back and holding, with his beak onto the nape of the female's

neck, and pulling hard (see Fig. 2). Mating usually lasts for two or three
seconds. If however, there are still some mealworms left uneaten the
female will attempt to reach them with the male clinging to her. This
usually results in the loss of a few feathers from the female's neck, and
the courtship-feeding again taking place.
Courtship-feeding happens every time the male is given a mealworm,
and it follows therefore that if the male is given for example five mealworms
(not of course all at the same time) he will " courtship-feed " the female
and mate or attempt to mate five times. The same applies to a lesser
extent with the Chinese Painted Quails, although in their case copulation
is less frequent--the male merely " giving " the mealworms to the female.

NOTES ON A PAIR OF LONGTAILED
PARRAKEETS

By G. A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
The Longtailed Parrakeet is generally held to be the anomalous member
of its genus. For whereas the others usually prove good aviary birds Long-
tails are supposed to be unduly sensitive to cold. The Marquis of
Tavistock (1927), for example, wrote that " they feel the cold more than
any other parrakeet. Requiring a temperature of not less than 70* F.
and are likely to die should it fall below 6o* F.: for which reason we
cannot hope to keep and rear them ". More recently Rutgers (1969)
voices the same opinion.
Last summer my attention was caught by an advertisement in " Cage
and Aviary Birds " for an acclimatised pair of Malayan Longtailed
Parrakeets. These had been kept in a small outside aviary for the previous
eighteen months. The unheated shed, to which the flight was attached
also served as a bird-room--having cages around the walls--and in one

of these the Longtails roosted for the night, gaining entry through a
permanently open bob-hole. They were being disposed of because they
proved too noisy, in the early morning, for the tolerance of the surrounding
householders. As they had been sold I eventually acquired them, third
hand, from a dealer.
By now it was autumn and the cock was a rather dishevelled individual
with the long centre rectrices, from which the species gets its name,
broken off short. The hen, was an equally ragged, dowdy, almost
uniformly khaki-coloured bird. In late October/early November I
noticed that the supposed hen was moulting out into a cock bird. However
my fear about " changing sex " was mistaken. She gained orange cheek
patches and assumed a greener cap but otherwise remained her normal
drab self. She soon proved to be no exception to the Psittacula rule of hen
birds being aggressive towards the males out of the breeding season. For
although extremely timid her antipathy towards her mate was so strong
that she would pursue and snap at him even when I stood but a few feet
off, her aggression towards him being far stronger than her fear of
myself. Therefore the cock was removed and brought inside for the winter
which he spent in a metal box-cage standing close to the window of an
extremely cold, disused bedroom; so cold that the water pot often froze
solid during the night. The belligerent hen was left with my dealer friend,
housed in a wooden shed roofed over, for illumination, with transparent
plastic sheeting; giving an internal environment, except for wind and rain,
almost identical to that out of doors. I assume that it was because she
had to clamber down the netting of her inside flight to get her food,
which was placed on the floor, that she suffered from frost-bitten feet,
for, after the winter, she had lost the terminal phalanges of all save three
of her toes. It was definitely not caused by having snow or hoar-frost
gathering on the perches--often stated to be the cause of this injury. The
cock remained unaffected.
Over the winter both partly moulted: mostly those feathers used in
sex-recognition and display, the hen moulting her head and some central
tail feathers, the cock regained his glorious filamentous tail, a few primaries
and all of his head feathering. In February I collected the hen and put her
in the cage with the cock. Up till now all that they seemed to eat was
sunflower and apple. Only seldom would they take a little canary seed.
What was most pronounced was the extraordinary large amount of both
food and water consumed, resulting in the most copious quantities
of moist faeces. As moulds will grow even at very low air temperatures
they required cleaning out at very frequent intervals to avoid the risk of
contracting Aspergillosis. When offered fresh unshelled peanuts they
immediately stopped eating the sunflower and lived solely on these for
almost a fortnight. Then, appetite sated, restricted themselves to just a
few peanuts a day. It was as if the previous monotonous diet had
deprived them of some essential dietary need which, once satisfied, could

be taken at a less liberal rate. Now they would eat grapes and orange.
They proved themselves to be exceptions to the general rule with parrots
in that they would not eat the exposed pips in a slice of apple before
the fruit. Indeed they left these delicacies entirely alone.
On the fifteenth of March they were put into a small outside aviary,
which they had to themselves; ten ft. long, six ft. high and three ft. wide,
with a small shelter for roosting in. Flying Longtailed Parrakeets remind
me much of Starlings. They whirr heavily weighted on short wings.
The thrust backwards given to the spar as they launch themselves into the
fir, and the momentum of each landing impact, caused all the perches to
vork loose, or to fall, within a few days of having them outside. Only
moderate woodchewers, their destructive attention was directed to
&apos;emoving bark from branches, leaving the shelter alone. The short toe-
mails are hooked in shape and once they flew, or blundered, onto the
j vire they could clamber up and down but remained ensnared and fastened
irm when they tried to fly off--caught by their own nails. Like Starlings,
vhich also give the impression of awkwardness when flving in a confined
! pace, they are said when in the wild to perform mass aerial displays
)efore finally roosting for the night.

182 G. A. SMITH--NOTES ON A PAIR OF LONGTAILED PARRAKEETS
Both sexes are rather stolid-looking characters, and the beauty that they
undoubtedly possess is to a large degree over-ruled by their stern and
forbidding-looking heads. When conscious of being watched both remain
perfectly still and unmoving. The cock, in contrast to the hen, and
irrespective of whichever direction his body faces, twists his head away
from the observer, such that he looks back, literally out of the corner of
his eye. For all the world as if he were frightfully shy and couldn't bear
to face one head on (Fig. i). The head is also bunched onto the shoulders
and the adoption of this backwards facing posture of the head keeps the
red beak and much of the lovely Victoria-Plum-coloured cheeks hidden.
The only break in the green of the body and head is the dull mauve nape
of the neck. However, should an alarming movement be made by the
onlooker, to see the better the bird brings his head completely round and
then, if satisfied that no offence is intended, swivels it back to its almost
totally hidden viewpoint. While this may be characteristic of the cock
bird the hen (her head is less strikingly tinted and has a blackish beak)
will gaze full face or laterally with none of his " coyness The voice
has the most mechanical of tones. The call-note made to starlings flying
over the aviary sounds identical to the peeping of a child's cheap toy
trumpet. However, unlike the neighbours of the original owners, I have
not found them noisy birds. And despite the tinnyness of all their
utterances they are not loud and certainly not irritating or unnecessarily
prolonged. They are most vociferous after, or before, heavy rain which
falls to interrupt an otherwise dry spell. The more usual incessant English
rain does not seem to have this power to " lubricate their vocal
chords ". They do not sunbathe; though the hen would sometimes spend
the hotter part of the day roosting in full sun--whereas she could have,
and mostly did, seek shade in the shelter along with her mate. Likewise
they made no attempt to bathe in the bath provided or in the rain.
However, after summer showers they were often seen rubbing themselves
on the damp netting of the flight in an attempt to foliage bathe. Food
items larger than a seed and small enough to lift are raised in the foot
to the head. Seeding heads of sow-thistle and dandelion may be bitten
off and then lifted up in the foot instead of being eaten directly off the
plant as would most parrakeets. Out of the breeding season this pair are
rather timid; though less so than my aviary-bred Ringnecks. Too close
observation of them makes them sleek the plumage and shiver the body
with nervous tension. Coupled with this shivering the respiratory
movements become exaggerated and quite audible and to the uninitiated
might seem as if they were suffering from pneunomia.
Breeding Behaviour
In the wild they are said to lay in February or March (Ali and Ripley
1969) and I therefore held out no real hope of getting them to breed, the
cock still continued a desultory moult and I gave them no box. In early

May the Longtails became unusually energetic. (Or probably, more
correctly, less prone to " freeze " when they saw me.) The cock
vigorously flapped his wings and called whenever birds larger than a
sparrow flew over. A week of spare time was wasted trying to saw a
length of hollow Ash log into a nesting chamber and then, thoroughly
exhausted by the effort, they were given a rather hastily-built box
fabricated from inch thick chip-board and with a plywood lid. Suspicious
as the birds were to anything new I was pleasantly surprised, two days
later, to see the cock peering into the nest hole. All courtship took place
on the top of the box, or in its very close proximity. They would start
very early at sunrise till perhaps 9 a.m., recommencing again in the late
afternoon--following the usual parrot siesta--for a further hour or so.
Almost all observations were taken from a twenty yard distant window and
because of this and also the hours they kept (they always roost full two
hours before any other birds in my small collection) my notes are a little
sporadic. Nevertheless though I was not fortunate enough to have them
breed they may prove of some slight interest.
In the breeding season the hen's attitude towards the cock entirely
changed. She would sit inert for much of the time, as if entirely oblivious
of him and his antics. However--although she looked as if she was just
about to doze off--any slight movement or sound proceeding from a
source other than the male would immediately alert her into her normal

f wide-awake self. Many of the early days were spent by both sexes
pushing the culmen, like a child with a sledge, along the top of the box
(Fig. 2). This method of progression is especially interesting for I have
noticed that very young parrots similarly trundle their beaks along the
ground when they push themselves under the feathers of a brooding parent
I bird. As soon as the male became more dominant he gave up this
subservient method of progression; but the hen used this as her normal
means of moving about the surface of the box until a few days before she
started to enter the nest. She would raise her head slightly with the back
horizontal and squeakily cawing, like a fledgling Rook, plead to be trod.
This I never saw him do. My impression was that he still remained
uncertain of himself when in too close contact with her. She first entered
the box in the last week of June and from then on spent much of each day

mysteriously inside. The male had entered the box several times during
the first two weeks, long before the hen, and was never seen to do so
subsequently.
Once courtship had started the cock became an entirely different
animal. He " walked tall ". In the winter months she seemed to be
larger than he. Now the position was reversed. His head was extended
well off the shoulders and seemed bulkier. His early display took place in
the absence of the hen and consisted of marching (the steps more
pronounced than in normal walking) to and fro on the top of the box.
After every two or three steps he would give a jump in the air. So far as I
could see this was a silent display. When doing this promenading alone
he would break off and excitedly call to Starlings flying over as if he wished
to draw attention to himself and his nest box. When the hen ultimately
joined him (she was a few weeks more retarded reproductive wise than he)
he became oblivious of other birds. He fed the hen not by regurgitating
in the usual parrot-pumping head up and down manner, but instead the
head was swung round and round three or four times as if relying on
centrifugal force to get the bolus up. She would sit quite unmoved by these
gyrations and take the proferred food without any discernible movement on
her part. Both indulged, in the early part of courtship, in much displace-
ment preening. Whereas she would attend to almost any part of her
person he mostly preened his upper chest which coincidently showed off
his broad cheek-stripes. This was distinct from the swaying part of later
stage courtship when he would sway the body slowly from side to side
turning the head to give her a broad lateral view of his cheeks and of the
contracting pupil of the eye. As well as this lateral swaying of the body
he also had a bowing display which usually terminated in him feeding
the hen. In this the head was bowed very low. The beak was then
raised off the ground, lifted quite high and then placed on the ground on
her opposite side.
Another pattern of courtship was for him to advance, swaying the body,
towards the hen--and as usual jumping every few steps--then when six or
seven inches away sidle round to take the next few steps crabwise and
finally to completely reverse and " back-in " next to the hen with the
last few steps. So that he stood slightly in front of and yet to one side of
her. Her beak lying on his back and her field of vision almost entirely
obstructed by his wonderful collar. They looked not unlike a couple
riding a tandem bicycle with him, unchivalrously, sitting in front. If she
moved away from him, and this slightly ludicrous coupling, he would
waddle after her, forgetfully omitting to jump and then back-in again.
He--and until I saw this I wondered at what use he had for his whip-long
tail--swished the tail from side to side, in wide arcs each time he changed
his direction and backed-in.
Although the hen spent long periods in the box until the end of July
she never laid.

G. A. SMITH NOTES ON A PAIR OF LONGTAILED PARRAKEETS 185
Longtailed Parrakeets are far from rare in the wild. Yet, rather oddly
(for Singapore a major bird market--lies practically at the centre of their
distribution) they are seldom imported. The few that do get brought in
seem, as is usual with Ringnecks and other " Psittaculas " to have a very
large disproportion of male birds. The pair that I have cannot be very
aberrant examples of hardiness for often acclimatised single cocks are
advertised for sale. So something other than a suspected intolerance
towards cold may be to blame for the recorded losses.
My impression would be that: (a) they require large amounts of
food- and will not eat if watched. Newly imported parrots, in my
opinion, often die of sheer starvation, even when in the midst of plenty.
(b) Psychological stress, they certainly shiver continually with fear when
they are kept close to disturbing factors--which is the usual lot of newly
captured birds, (c) Diet: whatever they do eat in the wild it almost
certainly is not fed to them in captivity. As they may partake of very few
forms of food once they do settle down this may predispose towards
deficiency disease, (d) Parasitism. Most wild birds--parrots included,
harbour various " worms ", The stresses of captivity may tend to upset
the normal balance " between host and parasite in favour of the latter.
The cock of my pair has, or had, microfilaria (larval bloodborne worms).
And popular belief has it that these birds die from a " worm in the heart *\
The worm probably lives in the peritoneal cavity or air sacs of the bird
&amp;quot; pushing " its infective larvae--microfilaria--into the blood. Thromboses
or " clots " of microfilaria may feasibly cause death through, say, Coronary
thrombosis; but the adult worm is not involved.

BEE-EATER THE CARMINE BEE-EATER, AND
OF A HYRBID BETWEEN THE TWO

By E. Callegari (Ravenna, Italy)
Some years ago, during a safari in East Africa, near Mombasa, I caught
an adult Carmine Bee-eater, Merops nubicus. This species is a lovely
carmine-red with blue-green on head, rump and upper tail-coverts. I took
it with me while on a visit to some national parks, and it arrived in Italy
all skin and bones, yet healthy enough to recover within a few days. It
proved to adapt itself to captivity so well that it displayed to a female of the
European Bee-eater, Merops apiaster , with which it shared an aviary.
Since then I have always been trying to obtain Carmine Bee-eaters, but
I had never been able to get any. After an unsuccessful journey to
Timbuctoo I went to the Uebi Scebeli, having been told of the existence
of a colony of these birds there. When I arrived at the banks of the river,
at the foot of the slope where the birds nested, four monitor lizards were
present; and I was told by the guide that when he first arrived at the spot
one of the monitors was clinging to the slope with a nestling in its mouth.
I returned home with eight of these nestlings. They grew healthy and
strong, and as early as the month of January the males began to display to
the females. I hoped to breed them but was faced with the old problem of
how to provide a suitable artificial nest. Taking the advice of Mr. Peter
Scott, I went to Professor Otto Koenig in Vienna to copy the artificial nest
he used. By the time that both the aviary and the nest were ready the
birds had already laid their eggs from the perches. In that year only one
pair of European Bee-eaters succeeded in rearing two nestlings.
Things went better the following year. When Spring came the birds
began to display, make nests and lay eggs. There were fights, and several
of the eggs as well as a few day-old nestlings were thrown out of the nests,
but two pairs of Carmine Bee-eaters were able to hatch four nestlings in all.
What surprised me most was the nest of one pair of European Bee-eaters.
They were feeding two young in the nest but once these emerged I realised
that they were, in fact, two hybrids from a Carmine Bee-eater and a
European Bee-eater. They look beautiful, and what is strange is that they
have a pink chin and throat and a thin blue-grey collar between throat and
breast.
When I sent the above information to the Avicultural Magazine 1
was asked if I would give further details of the feeding of the birds and the
making of the nest. I willingly describe all this and I hope it will be clear.
First of all you must bear in mind that Bee-eaters do not drink. For
this reason the birds must retain the water from the food which they eat,
and therefore the insects which you give them must not be dehydrated.

Another point of great importance is that they need frequent changes
in the kind of insects given. To make this point clearer I want to quote
what I wrote several years ago with reference to the feeding of three
White-fronted Bee-eaters kept in captivity. " They seemed to prefer
every new insect which I gave them." If my &apos;statement is not absolutely
accurate it does, however, indicate the birds' preference for variety in the
matter of food. They readily accept a vast range of the harder chitinous
insects in varying quantities; but refuse the softer insects such as cater-
pillars, wasp-larvae and larvae of lamellicorn and longicorn beetles.
A Tifi. ing t0 thC lnsects availa ble, I feed my group of European, Caimine
and White-fronted Bee-eaters on a mixture of 60% mealworms, 20% bees
and the remaining 20% of wasps, hornets, cockchafers, rose-beetles, flies,'
cockroaches, fresh-water shrimps, grasshoppers, dragonflies, butterflies'
big ants, cicadas, etc.
Of course it was much easier to find more varied and numerous insects
some fifteen years ago, when I made the first mixtures for three European
Bee-eaters. Today I have a wider experience in collecting these insects
but it is more difficult to find them; for a lot of these species have almost
disappeared. While once I could collect these insects in the neighbourhood
of Ravenna, I now must go many kilometers from the town to be able to
find some. I keep the insects in cold store and feed the refrigerated insects
to the birds, with the exception of the meal worms, which I supply alive.
This is fed to the species already mentioned, but another group consisting
of Little Bee-eaters and Cinnamon-chested Bee-eaters get only a 0 / of
bees, with no fresh-water shrimps at all.
This was the most satisfactory way I could find of feeding these birds
and keeping them alive and healthy without giving them an excess of anv
particular kind of insect. I am sure, however, that they would eat meaf-
worms in greater quantities and for longer periods; but fear they might
ultimately get tired of them. They enjoy spiders, scorpions, scolopenders
and small lizards too. They eat small quantities of cut lettuce as well,
and during the moult they even swallow a few feathers. They can tell their
prey by sight as well as taste. Thus they catch all the flying insects which
happen to get into the aviary, crying out with excitement for the insects
they mainly enjoy and discarding rather disgustedly those they do not
like---Arctndae, Tenthredinidae, Chrysomelidae, Coccinellidae, Can-
tharidae, Lampyridae, Metoecus , etc. I am surprised to observe that they
will accept a very small percentage of both Zygaenidae and Lytta
vescicatoria.
The artificial nest is made of a wooden box filled with a mixture of earth
md sand until compact. You must place it in the sunniest spot you can
ind. Remove one or two boards on the side you deem more suitable for
he digging of the nests (see plate). In doing this the soil will be left
pxposed, and in this the birds may dig their holes without any danger of
andslips.

If you provide the birds with adequate heating during the winter months,
and feed them as described above, the birds will survive well with only a
slight death-rate. But even here you may come across the disappointments
well known to all avicultunsts. Last year, in fact, I lost the mother and
one daughter of the Carmine Bee-eaters, and two specimens of the young
European Bee-eaters, one of which had nearly developed a ruby-red iris.
I believe that this is the first time that the Carmine Bee-eater has been
kept in captivity, the first time that it has been bred, and the first time that
hybrids have been obtained in this family.

A pair of Blue-crowned Motmots, belonging to Bill Ranson, a member of
our staff, has been housed at the Winged World since 1966. On several
occasions they tunnelled into the earth floor of the aviaries we have
exhibited them in. Normally these tunnels have been used for roosting in,
although on at least two occasions last year we optimistically hoped for
youngsters as the adults were observed taking food into the tunnel.
On each occasion however they stopped after a few days. Eventually
they were housed in one of our largest glass-fronted compartments
together with many Thrushes, Starlings, Wood Hoopoes, Bulbuls, Orioles,
Barbets, a Cock of the Rock and a Ground Cuckoo. The competition
for live food can be imagined and it is a wonder they managed to co-
mandeer sufficient to rear their young when they finally bred sucessfully.
Their earlier breeding attempts were no doubt thwarted by the collapse
of their tunnels, as they burrowed diagonally into almost level soil, and
then levelled out into their nest cavity. Consequently there was a not
great deal of soil over their tunnels, and it was loose, due to being hoed
daily. I am certain that they were finally successful because they tun-
nelled beneath a large concrete pool, which incidentally later broke its
back as a consequence. No cave-ins were experienced as the bottom of
the pool obviously acted as a roof for their tunnel and nest cavity, and the
surrounding damp soil no doubt aided egg incubation also.
We have no idea how long the incubation period was, as the adults were
extremely secretive in their movements. There was no doubt however
about their many visits to the tunnel with live food, which commenced
of April 13th. Maggots were left in the aviary ad lib , to the delight of
the other birds. Competition was also keen for the mealworms, crickets,
locusts, young mice and earthworms which were thrown to the Motmots
repeatedly throughout the day. Ten days later the calls of the youngsters
could be quite clearly heard some yards away. Strips of meat supple-

We were amazed at the size of the young Motmots, which were as
large as the adults. They had short tails of course, but resembled the
adults in colour also, although they lacked the breast spot.

(JJpupa epops longirostris )
By Clive Roots (Heysham, Lancs., England)
Our pair of Ihailand Hoopoes, purchased in 1966, produced infertile
eggs on many occasions, so we eagerly took the opportunity last year to
acquire four hand-reared youngsters. The original hen mated with one
of these birds and fertile eggs were laid early this year. Before this
happened however her behaviour was peculiar to say the least. For many
weeks she spent practically all day in the nest box and it was a rare
occurence to see her at all. The nest-box was suspended from the highest
point of their indoor aviary, which was shared with a group of Carmine
Bee-eaters, a breeding pair of Brown-throated Barbets, Minivets, Sunbirds
and several other species. The male Hoopoe fed her untiringly and we
occasionally checked to see if eggs had been laid. After two months,
and no eggs, we were naturally concerned that such a steady, established
bird should hide away for so long. The nest inspections became less
frequent, and we eventually decided to fill the box with rotten wood to
keep the hen out for a while and provide her with much-needed exercise
if she really did intend to lay. A last minute check however revealed that
i she had a nestful of healthy fledglings, apparently about two days old.
laying and incubation had occurred since our last check, just over
I three weeks previously, so we cannot provide any information on the
incubation period of these birds. The male Hoopoe continued to feed
-he hen and nestlings for several days before she emerged to assist him.

Maggots and earthworms were preferred, which eased the live food
situation as there was a great deal of competition from the Bee-eaters
for mealworms.
Two fledglings were seen at the entrance of the box twenty days after
we assumed they had hatched, but not until five days later did the first
one venture out, followed after two days by the other. The next day
two more youngsters appeared. They were exact replicas of the adults,
except for their shorter bills. Within three weeks however these were
equally as long as their parents' beaks and had it not been for the latter's leg
rings it would have been difficult to indentify them. These young Hoopoes
were splendid birds. Their feathering was perfect, their bills strong and
their legs and feet well developed. They were by far the finest youngsters
of any species reared at the Winged World. The adults were seen
mating while their young were still in the box, and they have nested again.
Our success with insectivorous birds is naturally attributed primarily
to the provision of a suitable high protein diet. The Thailand Hoopoes,
like all the other insect eaters, receive the standard softbill fare comprising
our own insectile mixture with raw minced beef. A fresh mixture with
finely diced apple replacing the meat is given late in the afternoon and
is left in overnight. A few maggots daily, and mealworms occasionally,
complete their basic diet. This is supplemented however by the earth-
worms, crickets and the not-so-welcome cockroaches which are now
thriving in their aviary, and they are continually probing the earth floor
and crevices for these and other invertebrates.

SUBSPECIES AND AVICULTURE: SOME NOTES
ON RECENT DIFFICULTIES
</sectionHeader>

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
There is usually little reason for aviculturists to bother about subspecies,
or races as they are sometimes called, of the different species of birds!
1 hey are likely to pay little attention to them unless two forms that were
regarded as species are combined as two subspecies within a single species.
In some cases, particularly where populations of a single species are
separated on islands the populations may be very different in appearance.
In such instances there has been a feeling that separate awards should be
made for first breedings of birds from these distinct populations. This
has been done in the past by the Avicultural Society for subspecies of
some parrots, but since this has recently led to doubts being expressed
concerning the subspecific indentity of such birds, it seems necessary to
try to explain the difficulties involved where named subspecies are con-
cerned.
The naming of subspecies began mainly at the beginning of this century.
It was intended for the use of museum systematists and many of the
differences involved between subspecies are so slight that they are only
useful if the user has a series of skins of birds from both populations in
front of him when he is considering them. Many of the differences are
those of populations, not of all individuals. Names were given not only
to separate populations such as those on islands, but also to various local
parts of continuous populations of widely distributed species. Names
were often given after an examination of only one or two individuals
from widely separated localities and further collecting may often have
revealed that such subspecies intergrade with no definite division between
them.
In addition it has been the practice to assign names to populations
when 75% of one sample differ in a particular character from all of the
other sample; but this also means that one in four of a named subspecies
might be indistinguishable from the next subspecies. The characters
.hat separate subspecies may be very fine distinctions in colour, shape,
)r size sometimes only distinguishable in certain plumages and one sex.
Since overall measurements cannot be taken from a stuffed skin, parts
;uch as the bill, tarsus, wings, and tail are measured. Variation in the
;ize of such parts may not mirror overall changes in size. In some
nstances the critical size differences separating the range of measurements
dentifying different subspecies may be as little as a millimeter.
These named subspecies were intended for use in discussing the
ariations apparent in samples of populations available as museum
pecimens. In 1949 Bernard Tucker pointed out that in the majority of
ases subspecies were not relevant to field studies of live birds, and
liscontinued the general use of subspecific names in the journal " British

C. J. O. HARRISON--SUBSPECIES AND AVICULTURE
Birds We should recognise that such subdivisions are not usually
relevant in aviculture either; and that an individual bird, or pair, for which
the precise locality of origin is unknown cannot be confidently assigned
to a subspecies unless the latter is one in which all individuals are strikingly
different from all other individuals in other subspecies of the species
concerned.
The attempt to apply these subdivisions to live birds in aviaries has
led to some difficulties. A Swedish member of the society, Mr. T. R. M.
Brosset, who is very interested in Parrots, visited the aviaries of a number
of British aviculturists and in doing so formed the opinion that a number
of birds had been wrongly attributed to particular subspecies. He sent
me some excellent colour transparencies of the birds concerned, together
with tentative identifications, and encouraged me to take a further look
at the matter. The two principal species involved are the Eclectus
Parrot, Eclectus roratus , and the Lorikeet, Trichoglossus haematodus.
The Eclectus Parrot illustrates the problem very well. There are
eleven named geographical subspecies. Only about five of these can
normally be identified by the amateur, and two of these intergrade.
The males of all are very similar. In E. r. pectoralis , the female is red,
maroon above, and dark blue on the breast. The male usually shows a
little yellow on the tail tip. Individuals of the subspecies biaki, aruensis ,
macgillwrayi, goodsoni , solomonensis , and majorensis cannot be distinguished
from pectoralis for ordinary avicultural purposes. This group inhabits j
the area from New Guinea to the Solomons and Northern Australia.
The birds originally described as Ceram eclectus , the breeding of which
was described in an earlier number of the Avicultural Magazine, i
appear, in fact, to have belonged to this group.
E. r. vosmaeri of the Northern Moluccas, and E. r. roratus of the Southern
Moluccas have violet on the upper mantle, neck and underside of the
females. On the former the underside of the female tail and under-tail
coverts may be yellow, while on the latter only the tail tip is normally
yellow, but this character is variable and the two intergrade. E. r. Cornelia
of Sumba and E. r. riedeli of Tenimber both lack blue on the neck, breast
and belly of the female, and the second has about an inch of yellow on
the underside of the tail while the first has virtually none.
The picture is more complex in the case of the Lorikeet. It was
analysed by Cain (1955). The New Guinea region is inhabited by a&amp;gt;
group of subspecies centred around Trichoglossus h. haematodus. These
birds have a red breast barred with black, a tendency towards black on
the belly, a greenish-yellow collar, blue on the head and brown on the
nape. These characters may vary independently within the population
formed by this group. Birds tend to be more heavily barred in the west, ]
bluer-headed and blacker below in the south, and so on. \ arious parts
of this population showing various combinations of these characters have
been given the names berauensis , intermedius , flavicans , massena , micropteryx ,

nesophilus, deplanchii, caeruleiceps , and nigrogularis. The variations are
not absolutely clear-cut and unless a bird can be compared with an
extensive range of museum skins it would seem inadvisable or impossible
to assign one of these names to it, and even then the identification would
not be certain, and I would suggest that for-avicultural purposes these
forms are best regarded as a single population.
A form with a plain red breast occurs on Bah, Lombok, Sumbawa and
Djampea, and has the names forsteni, mitchellii and djampeanus. A
greenish or yellow-breasted form occurs on the Lesser Sundas and has
the names capistr atus, fort is, flavotectus and weberi&apos;, and between the two
siresemanni on Kalao tua is intermediate in its characters.
The Australian group have bluer heads and unbarred breasts with
more orange and yellow mixed with the red; the other plain-breasted
forms having dark heads. T. h. moluccanus and septentrionalis have
greenish collars, rubitorquis has a reddish collar.
In addition to the above there is one individual form. T. h. rosenbergii
of Biak is like the first group but has very heavy blue-black breast bars,
more extensive red on flanks and wings and a very large yellow collar,
r The general picture within this group is therefore like that of the Eclectus
I Parrot &amp;gt; tmt in this case only six groups can be recognised with 22 names.
Some idea ol the difficulties that might be involved in identifying odd
buds of the first group can be gained from the following comments.
When Mr. Brosset sent his colour transparencies, D. T. Holyoak and I
I examined them independently in comparison with material in the collection
of the British Museum (Natural History). A pair of Lorikeets at Chester
f Zoo had been described as the Louisade Lorikeet, T. h. aberrans. Brosset
pointed out that aberrans was now a synonym of flavicans and since the
bird was not yellowish suggested that it might be T. h. micropteryx, or
massena or intermedius. Holyoak agreed they might be any of these, or
possibly caeruleiceps or deplanchii, and I was not sure that nigrofularis
could be ruled out. The birds which bred at Kelling Pines had been
. described as the Blue-headed Lorikeet, T. h. caeruleicaps. Brosset
thought that they were haematodus but was not wholly sure. Holyoak
suggested caeruleiceps or nigrogularis, but felt certain that many of the
other forms listed above could not be completely ruled out. My own
I view was that haematodus was a possibility but that caeruleiceps could not
be entirely dismissed.
In view of this I would repeat my opinion that as far as records and
aw ards for breeding are concerned it w r ould be better to recognise the
larger and more distinct natural groups and not to assume that every name
: must separate a distinct and identifiable population of individuals which
f are recognisable even when the precise locality of origin is not known.
I think too that zoological gardens and public collections should display
more caution in using subspecific names, and also that we should
recognise that dealers often have access only to rather limited sources

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England).
While reading an account of the breeding of one of these species by
A. H. Isenberg I had occasion to examine some museum skins and came
to the conclusion that most, perhaps all, the birds which have in recent
years appeared in collections of live birds as the Kansu Babbler, Garrulax
sukatschewi , are in fact individuals of the Grey-headed Babbler, G.
cineraceus.
The last has a resemblance to the Rufous-chinned Babbler, G. rufogularis ,
to which it is closely related, but lacks the elaborate pattern. It is mainly
a warm slightly rufous buff, with a vinous tint on breast and throat,
and orange-buff on tail coverts and hind-flanks. The crown of the head
is dark grey-black, there is a white spot on the lores between eye and bill
and the white continues under the eye to another small patch just below
and behind the eye. The ear-coverts are rufous. The lower edge of the
ear-coveits has an irregular blackish stripe breaking down into spots.
The bill is fairly stout. The edges of primary wing feathers are ash-grey,
greater primary coverts are black, and tertials and secondaries on the
closed wing are warm buff with a broad black band at the end and a
narrow white bar across the squarish tip. The central tail feathers are
similar with a broad black band, narrow white terminal bar and square
tips.
The Kansu Babbler has very subdued colouring and lacks black on-
wings and tail. It is soft vinous pink below and mainly pinkish grey on
mantle and head. The lores are dark with a dull blackish line through
the eye, another bordering the lower edge of the ear-coverts, and the
entire ear-coverts are white. The bill is more slender, tapering and very
slightly decurved. Primary feather edges are ash-grey, and tertials
and secondaries olive, the tertials having rounded terminal white spots,
the secondaries tiny triangular white tips. The central tail feathers are
olive brown with faint greyish fringes and tip. The tail is relatively long
and the tips of feathers taper a little. Tail coverts and flanks are light
orange-buff. This would appear to be a rare species of limited distribu-
tion. The Grey-headed Babbler has a wider distribution from Assam,
through northern Burma to adjacent parts of China.

AN EXPEDITION TO ALASKA IN SEARCH OF
GROUSE AND PTARMIGAN
AND ON THE WAY BACK A VISIT TO THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF AMERICA
</sectionHeader>

By Yukio Nakata (Osaka, Japan)
The grouse and ptarmigan occur as 11 different species on the Eurasian
Continent, and seven in North America. They are almost circumpolar,
but their total number is gradually decreasing.
I he dispatch of a group to Alaska for the purpose of taking some of
them for breeding in captivity was proposed by an American named
Mr. Ray Carr of the Western Game Breeder's Society, U.S.A. The
present writer had the pleasure of joining the group.
I he American members participating were unanimous in welcoming
the opportunity as a rare chance probably never to be enjoyed again in
their lifetime. This feeling was shared equally by me, and I found the
visit to Alaska to be the most rewarding and memorable experience.
Alaska is the most beautiful region in the entire North America. Its
southern part, when the group visited it, was in the midst of autumn, and
the long lines of birches with their leaves turned yellow, were seen literally
forming an endless vista. Actually, they extended over a distance of
1,000 km., dotted at places by glacier ice falls, beautiful placid lakes and
rivulets, each suggesting the most attractive spots for camping or angling.
Moreover, volcanoes Iliamna and Redoubt, and Mt. Spurr, all 3,000 m.
high, were snow-capped, towering high and majestic in the sky; while
Mt. McKinley, towering over 6,000 m. high, is said to be the highest
uountain in North America. It is now a National Park.
During the present expedition, I drove by car over a distance of about
3,000 km. To me, the visit to Alaska seemed to have been a visit to a
^iant natural zoo. On both sides of the road on which I drove along, a
variety of such wild animals, big and small, as moose, caribous, brown
bears, foxes, coyotes, porcupines, marmots, squirrels, grouse and ptarmigan
 |:ame out to greet me. At times, they were seen crossing the road in
:ront of my car. Almost at 10 min. intervals, as the car sped along, the
carcases of porcupines were found left lying on the ground, suggesting
Tat they had had the misfortune of being collided with or run over by
:ars because of the very slow speed at which they could run.
In the shoals of the limpid rivulets, groups of crimson salmon were
seen swimming up against the stream.
On the mid-slopes of the mountains sloping steeply high up into the
i sky abruptly from the roadside were seen dots of white, which, on the
doser examination through a telescope, were found to be the mountain
sheep. r I heir existence so high up struck the writer as something
extremely mystic.
In the sky, I saw many V-shaped formations of wild geese in flight.

The brief descriptions above will suffice to give a rough idea of Alaska's
natural scenery.
Once you step into such modern cities as Anchorage or Fairbanks a
totally different picture is presented, for here the fruits of human civiliza-
tion glitter. The hotels are brilliant, both inside and outside, and to
dine in the dining-room of a gorgeous hotel leaves an impression of great
luxury. But as a matter of fact our accommodation during travel through
Alaska consisted entirely of bivouacs, using eiderdowns and sleeping bags.
When I reached Alaska it was just September. In the southern part of
Alaska, the temperature then was 7*C at the lowest, and i8*C at the highest,
while, in the central part, it dropped to -4 *C at the lowest and it rose
just to 5-6 *C even at the highest.
The biting polar cold had not yet set in, but the present writer was
told that, on a certain day, Fairbanks recorded as low a temperature as
54*C below zero!
In the central part of Alaska, the visitor will see more snow-capped and
sharp-tapered peaks, and more spruces than birches. The number of
tall trees will decrease; in the Eagle Creek Ptarmigan Research Area, a
whole expanse of Tundra will greet him. There will now be no tall tree
to be seen there. The whole view is nothing but a vast expanse of
Tundra or wildly sloping hills with bushes, dotted with left over snow.
The grouse and ptarmigan are captured when they are on the ground
by means of a hand net, a mist net or a copper wire loop; while, when they
are perched on twigs, the use of a loop formed into a noose, made of a
thick vinyl thread, fixed at the tip of a telescopic and long angling rod
(over 5 m. in length), placed over the neck and shoulder of a grouse or
ptarmigan, was found highly effective.
At times, the cry of a baby grouse or ptarmigan may be mimicked to
attract its parents; when they come sufficiently near they may be caught
with a hand net.
On the Kenai Peninsula in the south, the grouse were captured under
the guidance of Dr. Larry Ellison, who has for several years been engaged,
in the research of the spruce grouse, living in a cabin erected especially
for the purpose deep in the forests of Sterling H.W. But for his guidance,
indeed, it would have been utterly out of question to capture grouse in
these forests, which are so thick and dense that in winter it would be
impossible to get out of them without help.
Dr. Ellison is an official researcher attached to the Alaskan Department
of Fish and Game who obtained his degree for his study of grouse, and
he was good enough to present me with a copy of his four-part treatise,
which was of tremendous interest.
I had the pleasure of staying at his cabin over two nights. It was not
supplied with electricity. Cooking was by propane gas and lighting was
provided from the same source. Water had to be drawn from East
Finger Lake, 100 m. distant, and the mountain wood had to be cut by

Normally Dr. Ellison would be engrossed in study, all alone in the
forests, but accompanied by two dogs, white and black.
In the central part of Fairbanks I had an opportunity of calling at
Alaska University, where I was taken to its research laboratory, and at the
breeding area outside the campus I inspected the reindeer, brown bears,
foxes, willow ptarmigan, etc. Many willow ptarmigan had already grown
to the size of adult birds. The rearing room was divided into two, the
one virtually being an ultra-red ray lamp-lighted warm room while the
other was a wire-floored pen with no shelter. Thy were fed with Purina
pellets. Apparently, no complicated feeds were given.
In connection with this visit the present writer feels himself much
indebted to another authority on the study of ptarmigan--Dr. Robert
Weeden, for his thoroughgoing encouragement and assistance; and also
to Dr. Ellison and Mr. and Mrs. J. Kubek for generous assistance and
advice.
After travelling through Alaska for ten days I boarded a plane from
Anchorage to San Francisco, then flew to Utah in order to attend the
annual convention of the American Game-Bird breeders Cooperative
Federation, which was to be held at Salt Lake City.
At San Francisco I was welcomed very kindly by Mr. Ronald Reuther,
the Director, and had the pleasure of making a round trip of the spacious
zoo ground with Mr. C. Rawlins of the London Zoo, who was also on a
i visit.
I was greatly impressed by the beautiful sight of the zoo, which had
lovely plantations and green lawns, dotted with yellow and red flowers.
It was far more beautiful than its counterparts in Japan.
The San Diego zoo, which I had visited last fall, was extremely spacious,
where natural environments with gorges, etc., especially designed and
well suited for wild animals to live in, were most impressive, and I was
struck, in particular, at the sight of numberless galapagos tortoises,
iguanas, humming birds, and the large collection of reptiles kept there.
On the occasion of my visit to this zoo, I was a grateful recipient of the
kindest hospitality provided by Kenton Lint, the Curator of Birds.
Among other game-bird breeders, I met Fitzsimmons-Denton who has
the most elaborate and scientific facilities for breeding of birds, and
appeared to be especially proud of such rare birds as Peacock Pheasants,
fungle-fowls, etc., which he owned. In particular, I noted with much
interest such Japanese species as Ijima Copper Pheasants and long-tailed
fowls kept there in quite a large number.

By A. A. Prestwick (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
Since 1600, the date accepted by the Survival Service Commission,
International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources,
as the reckoning date for modem extinction, 167 species of birds have
certainly become extinct, and at least 340 are considered to be endangered
species. Needless to say, a number of parrot species are included in
both groups.
Some species have vanished, or are vanishing, through natural causes,
but man is responsible for the status of the great majority--destruction of
habitat by cultivation, felling of forests, draining of swamps, shooting and
trapping, and persecution by introduced predators.
An attempt has been made to list all the parrot species that are now
certainly extinct. Just a few " probables " are included. It is not known
for certain that they are extinct but it is feared so. It is to be hoped that
they have vanished only temporarily.

In the Library of Utrecht there is a manuscript journal kept during
the voyage to Mauritius of Wolphart Harmanszoon, 1601-1602, in which
there is a sketch of this parrot. Sir Thomas Herbert sketched this large,
probably flightless, blue-grey parrot, with its enormous bill and distinct

Ara tricolor Bechstein, 1811. Cuba and Isle of Pines, West Indies.
This was a comparatively small macaw, length about 18 in., pre-

living until about 1885, but the last-recorded specimen was one shot at
La Vega, near Cienaga de Zapata, on the south coast, in 1864. There

Ara autochthones Wetmore, 1937. St. Croix, Virgin Islands, West
Indies.
Known only from osseous remains. Nothing appears to have been
recorded concerning this rather primitive macaw.
Mauge's Conure.
Aratinga chloroptera maugei (Souance), 1856. Puerto Rico and Mona
Island, West Indies.
1 his conure differs from all allied principally in having the whole of
the under wing-coverts red. The last specimen was taken on Mona
Island, by W. W. Brown, a collector, in 1892. Only three specimens are
known to exist, in Paris, Leyden and Chicago.

Carolina Parrakeet.
Conuropsis carolinensis carolinensis (Linnaeus), 1758. South-eastern
United States of America, from southern Virginia to Florida.
Phis parrakeet was bred in captivity on several occasions: first by Dr.
Karl Russ in Germany, in 1879. The greatest success was obtained in
the Cincinnati Zoological Garden, where the last known example died in
September, 1914. There are specimens in most of the principal
museums.

Differed from the preceding by being somewhat paler generally. The
late of extinction is doubtful. Three of a flock of 11 were shot in
Louisiana, in 1881; one was reported shot in Kansas, 1904; and one is

<bodyText confidence="0.947392321428572" page_id="58076298"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
Amazona vittata graciliceps Ridgway, 1915* Culebra Island, West
Indies.
Described as smaller than the Red-fronted or Puerto Rico Amazona
Parrot Amazona vittata vittata. None has been found since 1899. Only
three specimens are preserved: they are in the United States National
Museum.
Reunion or Mascarene Parrot.
Mascarinus mascannus (Linnaeus), I 77 1, Island of Reunion, Indian
Ocean.
Pere du Bois described this parrot very accurately in 1674. In 1834
Carl Hahn figured an example then living in the Menagerie of the King
of Bavaria. Unfortunately all trace of this bird, probably the last of its
kind, was lost. Only two specimens have been preserved, in the
Museums of Paris and Vienna.
Rodriguez Parrot.
Ne crop sit tacus rodericanus (Milne-Edwards), 1867. Rodriguez, Indian
Ocean.
Known from bones and the description of an anonymous, contemporary
observer. Last seen about 1760. It was apparently approximately the
size of a large cockatoo, completely uniform green, with a huge bill.
The bones are at Cambridge.
Seychelles Alexandrine Parrakeet.
Psittacula eupatria wardi (E. Newton), 1867. Seychelles, Indian
Ocean.
Still present in 1870, when a few skins were collected for Cambridge
University, but there is no later record. This race differs from the
Ceylon P. e. eupatria and allies in wanting the rose collar. There are
skins in only five museums--Cambridge, England; Cambridge, Mass.;

London; Paris; and New York.
Mauritian Ring-necked Parrakeet.
Psittacula krameri echo (A. and E. Newton), 1876. Mauritius, Indian
Ocean.
Now very scarce, even if not actually extinct. Last sighted in April,
1911, when Colonel R. Meinertzhagen saw an adult pair. Differs from
the Ring-necked of Africa and India in being larger, darker green in colour,
and in having broader tail-feathers.

Reunion Ring-necked Parrakeet.
Psittacula krameri eques (Boddaert), 1783. Island of Reunion, Indian
Ocean.
Known only from Daubenton's plate, 1783, and from a statement by
Pere Dubois that he saw them, about 1670. * How it may have differed
from echo of Mauritius is not known.
Exiled or Rodriguez Ring-necked Parrakeet.
Psittacula exsul (A. Newton), 1872. Rodriguez, Indian Ocean.
No information has been forthcoming since 1875, when an immature
male was killed by Vandorous, on 14th August. It must be considered
extinct. It was a medium-sized parrakeet, total length 16 in., of a pale
greyish-glaucous colour. Only two specimens are known, both in
Cambridge.
Cebu or Golden-backed Hanging Parrot.
Loriculus philippensis chrysonotus Sclater, 1872. Cebu, Philippine
Islands.
This hanging parrot was gradually exterminated by the destruction of

Paradise or Gould's Beautiful Parrakeet.
Psephotus pulchernmus (Gould), 1845. South-eastern Queensland to
northern New South Wales, Australia.
At one time believed to be extinct it was rediscovered by C. H. Jerrard,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.971970695652174" page_id="58076299"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
in 1921. The following year he photographed a pair at the nest. The
last authentic sighting appears to be that of Jerrard on 14th November
1927. There is little evidence to suggest that it still exists.
Lord Howe Island Green Parrakeet.
C \ anorhaniphus novaezelandiae subflavescens Salvadori, 1891. Lord
Howe Island, South-west Pacific.
The last pair was seen by a Mr. Hall, in 1869. This subspecies was
about the size of the Norfolk Island Parrakeet C. n. cookii , and rather
like it in colour, but of a more yellowish tinge. There are specimens in
London, but no others have been recorded. There are fortunately still
seven races of C. novaezelandiae living, although several are very reduced
in number.
Macquarie Island Red-fronted Parrakeet.
Cyanorhaniphus novaezelandiae erythrotis (Wagler), 1832. Macquarie
Island, south-east of Tasmania.
The last examples were seen about 1913. This subspecies was larger
and paler than the New Zealand Red-fronted C. n. novaezelandiae . There
are specimens in London. As there are no trees on Macquarie Island
this parrakeet nested amongst tussocks on the ground, and so was an easy
victim to abandoned house cats, etc.
Tahiti Parrakeet.
Cyanoraniphus zealandicus (Latham), 179** Tahiti, French Oceania.

century. The last authentic specimen was taken in 1844 by Lieutenant
Marolles, and is now in Paris. Other specimens are in London and
Liverpool. The species differed mainly in that it had a brown-black
frontal band (crown green).
New Zealand Orange-fronted Parrakeet.
Cyanorhamphus malherbi Souance, 1857. Hen Island, Little Barrier
Island, South Island, New Zealand.
There have been only five reports during the past 80 years, most of
them unconfirmed. If not actually extinct it must be extremely rare.
Ulietea (now Raiatea) Island or Society Islands Parrakeet.
Cyanorhamphus ulietanus (Gmelin), 1788. Raiatea Island, Society
Islands, French Oceania.
This very distinct species, olive-brown with brown-red rump, is known
only from two specimens collected by G. R. Forster in 1773 or I 774 &amp;gt;
during Captain Cook's second voyage. There are skins in London and
Vienna.
Night Parrot.
Geopsittacus occidentalis Gould, 1861. South and Western Australia.
Only one specimen has been collected this century but there have been
unconfirmed sightings as recent as i960. It must be considered a vanished
species. There are specimens in eight museums. Dr. Karl Russ is
credited with breeding this parrot in Germany, in 1877: but Dr. Russ
never made any claim to have done so. There must surely have been a
confusion of common names.
HYPOTHETICAL
The parrots listed as hypothetical are birds known only from the
descriptions of travellers and explorers of long ago. It must be remem-
bered that the majority had little or no training as naturalists, con-
sequently their descriptions leave much to be desired. They are some-
times of the sketchiest and it is perhaps remarkable that since 1900
authors should have seen fit to bestow scientific names on about a dozen,
supposed species or races, including seven macaws. It is, however, only
fair to say that they are listed merely as " hearsay species ".
Guadeloupe Violet Macaw.
Anodorhynchus (? Ara) purpurascens Rothschild, 1905. Guadeloupe,
French West Indies.
Don de Navaret, 1640, described a macaw of entirely deep violet.
Probably the description should not be taken too seriously.
Yellow-headed or Jamaican Red Macaw.
Ara gossei Rothschild, 1905. Jamaica, British West Indies.
Based on a macaw described by a Dr. Robinson who saw an incomplete,
stuffed specimen. It was said to have been shot, probably about 1765* by
Mr. Odell, about 10 miles east of Lucea. The specimen appears to
have been lost.

Jamaican Green and Yellow Macaw.
Ara erythrocephala Rothschild, 1905. Jamaica, British West Indies.
Based on poor hearsay evidence. It must have been extinct by earlv
in the nineteenth century.
Guadeloupe Red Macaw.
Ara guadeloupensis Clark, 1905. Guadeloupe, French West Indies.
Extinct since early eighteenth century (? 1722). Based on a good*
description, but no specimen. It appears to have resembled the Red and
Yellow Macaw A. macao , but was smaller and the tail was all red.
Dominican Green and Yellow Macaw.
Ara atwoodi Clark, 1908. Dominica, British West Indies.
Based on a rather doubtful description by Thomas Atwood, published
in 1791.
Yellow and Blue or Martinique Macaw.
Ara martinica Rothschild, 1905. Martinique, West Indies.
Based solely on the unconfirmed description of Pere Bouton, published
in 1640.
Mysterious Macaw.
Ara erythrura Rothschild, 1907. " One of the West Indian Islands
Based on a description by De Rochefort, published in 1658.
Guadeloupe Conure.
Conurus labati Rothschild, 1905. Guadeloupe, French West Indies.
Based on the writings of J. B. Labat, 1722. It is said to have been
about the size of a Blackbird, entirely green except a few, small red
Feathers on the head. No specimens exist.
Guadeloupe Parrot.
Psittacus violacea Gmelin, 1788. Guadeloupe, French West Indies.
Known by descriptions of naturalists and travellers--Du Tertre, 1667,
Labat, 1722. Probably extinct since early eighteenth century. No
specimens exist.
Martinique Parrot.
Amazona martinica Clark, 1905. Martinique, West Indies.
The only description is that of Labat, 1722. No later report. The
&amp;gt;arrots of Guadeloupe and Martinique may possibly have been races of
he same species, or even the same species, as there is no indication of how
hey differed.
Bourbon Parrot.
Necropsittacus borbonicus Rothschild, 1905. Island of Reunion,
ndian Ocean.
Known only from the short description of Pere Dubois, 1669: " Body
size of a large pigeon, green; head, tail and upper part of wings the
olour of fire

In 1966, we obtained a pair of Black-headed Ibises ( Threskiornis
melanocephala) which successfully bred and raised two young in 196/
and three in 1968. At that time we put a pair of Straw-necked Ibises
(Threskiornis spinicollis ) into the same aviary with the result that very soon
the male Black-headed and the female Straw-necked Ibis formed a pair.
They have bred in 1969, and a hybrid was reared. In 1970, their first
two eggs were put into an incubator. After 28 days, the young hatched
and were raised artificially. At first they were fed with a mixture of
predigested fresh water fish, meat and chicken meal. Later on they got
small pieces of fish and meat, salad, cooked rice, and in addition calcium
and vitamins. This diet proved to be satisfactory because the young
developed very well and as rapidly as the two others which a little later
were raised by their parents.
All five hybrids are similar in coloration: they look very much like
Black-headed Ibises although their neck is covered with white feathers
and there is more black on the wings and back than in Threskiornis
melanocephala. Due to the good breeding results, our aviary has become
so overcrowded that we were forced to pinion all our young ibises. They
now live among geese and ducks on one of our lakes where they make a
beautiful exhibit.

Since the last London Zoo Notes we have had a particularly active
period compounded of the usual hopes and frustrations, rearrangements,
exchanges and purchases.
Some of the more interesting adult arrivals have been Hooded
Mergansers, Scarlet Ibises, Bateleur Eagles, Mikado Pheasants, Allen's
Gallinule, Pygmy Kingfishers, Wood Hoopoes, Striated Thrushes and
Thick-billed Weavers. A small collection of southeast Asian Pigeons
and Doves was presented and included four species or subspecies not
seen in the Gardens before; the Mountain Imperial Pigeon Ducula badia
badia and Ducula badia griseicapilla , the Little Cuckoo Dove Macropygia
ruficeps and the Little Green Pigeon Treron olax.
There have been a number of notable deaths including a male Ne-ne,
female Golden Eagle, our adult male Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise,
and the Naked-throated Bell Bird. The latter's strident call will be
missed, especially as the bird had been in the collection for 18 years.
Fortunately we have managed to replace the Ne-ne and Golden Eagle,
though in both cases as yet there has been no obvious permanent pair
bonding.
Pursuing the policy of providing where possible mates for our birds,
we have obtained a number of prospective husbands or wives. These
have included a Chough, Little Owl, and a number of ducks and geese.
It is too early to say how successful this year has been for breeding,
though it is satisfying to record another Spectacled Owl and 3 Black-
footed Penguins, including twins.
The building of the new Ape and Monkey houses has resulted in the
loss of the Great Aviary and the consequent rehousing of a number of
birds. The opportunity was taken to rearrange a number of exhibits.
For example, the Scarlet Ibis are now housed outside alongside the
Cariamas and Kookaburras.

I have ample opportunity of studying the behaviour of several pairs of
Moorhens. But a point puzzles me, as it has many reputable ornithologists
in the past. When disturbed on land a Moorhen runs for cover, but
when suddenly disturbed on open water it sometimes dives and swims
under water. The point is mentioned by Witherby (v. 198, 305): " Birds
which have dived when startled frequently remain almost submerged,
preferably under cover of bank or amongst plants or surface debris, often
exposing first beak only, and sometimes little more, or gradually showing
head or head and surface of back, and remaining thus till danger appears
to have passed." A footnote deals with this problem and in fact says:
" The means by which this is effected has been disputed. Some have
maintained that it is incredible that the buoyant bird--whatever may be
the case where submergence is only partial--could maintain itself almost
completely under water without artificial aid, and it has been emphatically
asserted that it does in fact hold on to the stems of water-plants with
its feet. . . It seems clear, however, that the bird is capable of submerging
at least the whole trunk without such assistance, and Dr. C. B. Ticehurst
has pronounced himself satisfied that a bird which showed no more than
the beak and fore-head above water did not hold on to anything with its
feet. * # #
G. A. Smith, 20th July, 1970: " This year's breeding has been marred
(is there such an event as a good season?) by infertility. Carelessness
coupled with a heavy, and most unexpected fall of late snow, lost me my
mature lutino (albino) Cockatiels--the roof of a holding aviary collapsed
with the weight. Therefore I had to rely on their progeny. Unfortunately
young male Cockatiels are often infertile. Usually, I feel sure because
they lack a sense of " physiological direction "--when the hen is trod they,
as like as not, try to copulate with the head of the hen rather than the tail.
Or, and just as uselessly, sit like an avian jockey on the hen's back.
Sometimes they may slowly spin around as if through moving they might
" remember " what to do next; but even this is beyond many and once-
mounted they do little but admire the view from the higher advantage
point. My New Zealands are most disappointing. The Yellow-fronted
first pair had eleven eggs, none of which hatched--though all were fertile--
the chicks dying a few days before each should have hatched, despite the
excellent mothering of the hen. Next time she laid thirteen. After seven
had hatched the cock--the most charming and suave of birds--died after an
illness of less than a night's duration. Acute congestion of the lungs, the
heart muscle literally ruptured trying to force blood through the useless
respiratory system. This was my twelfth post-mortem on a New Zealand,
and apart from five with psittacosis, all the rest have died from totally
disconnected illness, as if they wished to sample all known diseases during
their short life on this earth. The hen is masterfully rearing--the seven
chicks are now three weeks old. The other eggs I gave to a hybrid pair.

And the cock bird, I think it was him, decapitated the lot after a week or so.
T he other pair of Yellow-fronted had seven eggs, three of which were
fertile and hatched. 1 wo young died in the nest of aspergillosis (I have
decided never to use rotten wood for nest furniture, replacing this now
with inverted sods). The sole survivor is a hen. The next round of
seven eggs had only two fertile. The hen has never hatched more than
three, and I've given these to a pair of Red-fronted. I was hoping that
she'd nest again. Instead of which she is only brooding the " memory ".
New Zealands are most odd birds--they will moult and breed pell-mell
all at the same time. 1 hey do not stand a chance when disease strikes to
" test " them.
After much searching I managed to get a fine pair of Red-fronted from
our member David Castle. She has laid twice but unfortunately on both
occasions seven totally infertile eggs. The cock is too afraid of his spouse
to more than feed her. So apart from a few Norwich canaries, some few
Cockatiels and some, I hope, New Zealands success is bad. I did hold out
hope of getting the Longtails to nest, and though she sits inside the nest
most days, even now, I feel that it will have to be " next year ". I know
that it is a sign of desperation but I am positively looking forward to next
year. It would be impossible for it to duplicate this year's literally
dozens of eggs and barely a chick."

Tailpiece. During recent months several pairs of Red-rumped Farra-
keets have been sighted in the heart of Adelaide. L. R. Comport, Bird
Keeping in Australia , April 1970, reports that an unexpected sighting
from his office window prompted him to interrupt a telephone call to a
business friend with the comment " Good heavens--Red-rumps." The
friend's rejoinder was somewhat confused but was to the effect that mini
skirts must be particularly short in that part of Adelaide!

S. Vere Benson. International Council for Bird Preservation, 1970
London and New York: distributed by F. Warne and Co. bos.
Nowadays most regional bird books are the work of a group of authors,
and Miss Benson is to be commended for producing this admirable
work as a one-woman effort, both text and illustrations being her own.
We have become so used to the well-illustrated field-guides to birds,
available for Europe and North America, that when we find ourselves in
regions for which no such work is available, most of us are at a loss to
identify what we see. The Middle East has always represented a gap of
this kind in the regional coverage of field-guides, and the present work
provides just what is needed for the Western part of this area.
In the introduction the author sets the scene with her comments on
the varied habitats and the birds to be found there, and on the impressive
autumn raptor migration. She also makes a strong plea for conservation
in this region. A checklist of species with indication of status is included.
For each species notes are given on range, identification in the field,
voice, and habitat. Each is illustrated, 94 in colours and 258 in black and
white. The colour plates illustrate in particular those species occurring in
these regions and not found in the European field-guides, which most
people are likely to use in conjunction with the present volume. Species
only occasionally recorded are listed at the end of the main text. Many
of these are illustrated, and where this is not done a brief indication of
the salient points of recognition is given. An appendix illustrates
and comments on the recognition of difficult birds of prey in flight and
describes plumage variations of the Pied Wheatear and Persian Robin.
A second appendix gives brief descriptions and some illustrations of
the additional species likely to be encountered in Jordan.
A primary aim of the authoress in writing this book has been to make
the people of the Lebanon aware of their heritage of bird-life and to try
and awaken a desire to conserve it before it is to late. The International
Council for Bird Preservation has lent its support by publishing the book
and by planning for the production of an Arabic edition. The book is to be
recommended as a valuable addition to anyone's books on bird identifi-
cation; all profits from its sale will be given to the work of the I.C.B.P.

Raethel. Stuttgart: W. Keller &amp; Co., 1966. Price DM. 5.80.
1 his excellent little book on bird illnesses can be recommended to all
who read German. It deals with bird diseases of all kinds, both those
due to infection and those due to malnutrition; accidental injuries;
, and infestation by parasites. I here are interesting discussions of various
: aspects of bird behaviour and bird-keeping where these are relevant to the
main theme.
I fear that in Britain, where the private citizen is sometimes considered
1 unfit to have free access to modern medicines, some of the recommended
remedies may not be readily available to the rank and file of bird keepers.
The author points out that very many differently-caused illnesses may
give rise to the same or similar symtoms. Like most who have written on
this subject he recommends the use of small, heated cages for sick birds.
Another very experienced German aviculturist, Dr. Jurgen Nicolai, has,
\0x25A0 however, argued cogently that it is much better to put the sick bird in a
large cage heated at one end only so that it can choose what degrees of
warmth it feels in need of.
I he book is illustrated with a large number of very good drawings.
It is to be hoped it will be translated into English. D. G.

Dover Publications. London: Constable and Company Ltd. 1970.
Price 47s. 6 d.
A
A strong and handsome reprint of an important textbook (formerly
titled Birds of Oregon) including one- to two-page descriptions and
biographies of each species and race recorded in the area, a short description
of the local life-zones and the progress of ornithological exploration there,
and a 29-page bibliography.
It seems debatable whether attempts should be made to bring this
type of textbook up to date as it seems pointless without a very thorough
revision, yet if this is attempted it is no longer the same book and arguable
that it were better to write a new one.
Meanwhile everyone seriously interested in the birds and the develop-
ment of knowledge about them in an important area like this remains
anxious to have the original version on their shelves and must welcome
good reprints such as this. We should have more of them in the United
Kingdom as well. W.R.P.B.

COCKATIELS--THEIR VERSATILITY AS FOSTER PARENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991670592592593" page_id="58076310"  page_num="212" year="" vol="">
During 1969, a pair of Lutino Cockatiels produced a fourth clutch of eggs, and
as they had reared three rounds I did not want them to suffer the strain of a fourth.
Having no normal cockatiels laying at the time, I decided to experiment w T ith a pair
consisting of an old cock and a very immature hen. They had spent some weeks
in the box without laying, and I put in a single egg. This was accepted promptly,
and the following day the remainder of the clutch was added. In due course,
four chicks hatched and fledged--without the foster hen ever having laid!
This year, another pair of Lutinos deserted their three eggs, which I offered to a
similar foster pair (1967 cock, late 1969 hen). Again these were accepted, and
two duly hatched. After they had been close ringed, three more close-ringed
chicks were added from a pair (split Lutino cock/normal hen) which had hatched
eight of their 10 eggs, thus levelling off both pairs with five chicks each. These have
all fledged, and are independent.
Obviously one cannot draw definite conclusions from only two examples, but I
think it can be taken as indicative of possibilities. I shall certainly retain two or
three third round hens this year for similar use next season.
Finally, the first night that one of my hen Bourke's stopped brooding, there was a
sharp frost, and the following morning one chick was dead, one nearly so (it died
24 hours later) and the third was revived. After being warmed and hand fed, this
was put into a nest of newly hatched and hatching normal cockatiels. I was quite
astonished at the way it thrived, and duly fledged. The sight of a comparatively
huge cockatiel pumping partly digested food into a tiny Bourke s, nearly beheading
it and knocking it off the perch in the process, is the most comic I have beheld.
Incidentally, I wonder if this is unique? Unfortunately the photographs I took
of this have not come out well enough for reproduction, although the prints are
quite reasonable.

Dr. Swaenepoel has written to point out that in his article on Indian Ringnecked
Parrots (May-June issue, pp. 92-94), he had made a momentary error and written
that an albino male might be expected to have a red and black collar. He points
out that since the blue form lacks the red of the collar, and the lutino lacks the black,
he would, of course, expect the albino to show no collar at all.

AN OBITUARY

By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
When I was very small, about three years old I think, I found myself
spending a holiday on a tea-estate known as " Woodside " in the hills
of Ceylon. The planter was my grandfather, and a large percentage of
his largish family were, if I remember well, also there. Certainly there
were three aunts present and an uncle or two in addition to my own
parents.
Life was very good in the eyes of a small boy and I particularly
appreciated the attentions of the youngest of my aunts because she was
clever at making birds' nests out of plasticine with eggs to go in them and
a separate mother-bird to sit on top. She was also good at chasing
butterflies for me to examine and admire, and was not repelled by frogs.
However, one day a new interest came into the adult conversation
which was led by my father, and it concerned the fact that a gentleman
by the name of Barnes-Wingdove was in the neighbourhood, and that my
father had in fact seen him. Apparently he was a very splendid person,
and altogether of great interest. Secretly I wanted to see him, but dared
to confide this desire only to my favoured aunt. Time, of course, has
removed all the details of how the meeting was to be arranged, but
everyone decided upon an evening walk with that end in view. I remem-
ber the walk not so much on account of Mr. Barnes-Wingdove, but
\0x25A0 because in that part of the island the jungle harboured a plentiful leech
population, and I was initiated into the ready methods of getting rid of
them when they had collected for a feast upon my person. (Happily I
&apos;was unaware of the presence of these parasites until after the party
returned home and I was being prepared for the tub!)
During the walk, quite suddenly I heard someone say in a hoarse
whisper, " there he is! Quick!! There!, Going through the trees! "
My aunt had grabbed my arm and was urgently pointing into the gloomy
forest nave. " There; did you see him? " Alas, I had not; and I won-
dered about the strange ability of adults to see someone " there " when
he was obviously not there!
1 Fortunately for children, disappointments can be short-lived and I
soon ceased to worry about Mr. Barnes-Wingdove because a troop of

Grey Wanderoo monkeys paid us a visit; and there were plenty of dancing
dragon-flies over the hill stream to interest me. A large blue-black;
Carpenter-bee had a nest in one of the verandah beams and I daily was
able to watch her come and go. My brother had found an elegant
web-spider who had netted the passage between the trellis on the wall
and a hibiscus bush, and she was busy executing capital punishment on
insect trespassers who essayed to pass on their varying occupations.
Once the Carpenter-bee was indiscreet enough to get herself tied up in
the spider's web, and I well remember her annoyance. The change in
her drone from a dignified bass to the strident " eeeeee . . . e . . . z " ol
extreme petulance, was enough to frighten me! and the spider too was
hesitant when she came out from her rest-room beneath a hibiscus leal!
to investigate her victim. She decided not to press her toll-charge ancj
retired, no doubt complaining to herself, about vandalism and askim
herself "who is to repair the depredations? " This question was purel)
rhetorical, because as a matter of course she consumed her web even
night and spun a new one by breakfast time! The bee disentangled
herself and flew away to get rid of the sticky strands and clean up.
So Mr. Barnes-Wingdove passed out of my interest for two years, bu
he was never forgotten. His death came somewhat suddenly when
discovered that he had an alias which quite altered my imagined impressioi
of him. For some time previous to my better understanding I hat
entertained misgivings about his character because in answer to m;
questions about him I had been told that he had green wings, a scarle
beak and flew very fast! This information I had filed away in my mint
labelled, " for future comprehension ", because I was not brought up t
doubt the words of my seniors, and to solicit too much information wa
not in my make-up.
But one day I was bothering the taxidermist at the Colombo Museur
whilst he was in the process of setting up a specimen of a very attractiv
bird. I was told in answer to my query that the bird was a Bronze-winge I
Dove!! The penny dropped at last and the ghost that had hovere j
periodically over my head for what had seemed a long time was exorcise
and finally laid. The mysterious and puzzling gentleman was dead; an
with him I buried the childish notion that people say what they meai
and say it clearly to be understood aright. Another lesson that sma
boys should not eavesdrop on adult conversation--I only learned when
myself became adult!
Chalcophaps indica , or Bronze-winged Dove, is perhaps better known t
aviculturists as the Emerald Dove. I will not enlarge on the suitabilit
of this English name because a whole essay could be written about tf
patent absurdity of many vernacular names given to birds and animal
It is in this case enough to identify the species which is a well-known bir
anyway, although not as commonly kept as many other, less attractiv
subjects.

}/
I will not bore the reader with a description because I hope and trust the
accompanying colour plate will serve adequately to convey a fair idea of
the cock bird s appearance. 1 he hen is duller, and lacks most of the
grey and white top to her head, but it must be pointed out to those who
do not know this dove, that the green of the wings and back is all metallic,
and in a different light it can appear just like burnished bronze. Hence
the name. It bears no resemblance to an emerald whatever.
In its jungle home, this bird is rather to be heard more than seen, but
it has the habit of alighting on jungle tracks and cart roads to pick about
for scraps of food. As one walks down such a path a pair of these doves
may be flushed when they are engaged upon the elevating job of examining
buffalo or other manure for any edible matter. They will fly further
along and alight again not very far away, but if persistently disturbed they
make off into the forest with rapid flight whither it is useless to try and
follow.
They are not rare birds and are not very particular about altitude up
i to about 8,000 ft. but they are not to be found in very dry places or
where the forest is too thin, for they seem to have a distinct preference for
cover.
The only one I ever possessed myself I bought from a Calcutta dealer
out of humanitarian motive. The bird was very timid and wild and
would not settle down in my mixed aviary at all, so I sent him with a
friend who was going up to the Burma front to be released en route.
Wild doves in sudden confinement are not an edifying sight: they batter
themselves in distressing fashion and are better off released unless one
has the time to devote to taming. But this dove can do very well in a
 |suitable enclosure and they have been successfully bred on quite a number
of occasions. A friend of mine in Ceylon regularly kept pairs in an aviary
* with suitable companions. He fed them all on a mixed diet of bird-seeds,
berries and a daily dish of succulent termites. A small natural stream
ran through the enclosure and all things were ideally arranged with the
l least trouble and inconvenience to the owner. In English conditions
matters are not quite so simple; but a few of the Society's members have
succeeded well in their treatment of Bronze-winged Doves and it is to
be hoped that a good strain of aviary-bred birds will be established.
However, I would hate to see them " improved " by line-breeding and
other means which have produced such disasters as " Pouters ".
The nest is said to be a more substantial structure than that of most
pigeons; but although I spent some time in areas where these doves were
* not rare, both in India and Ceylon, I was never able to find a nest myself.
All accounts of the Bronze-wing pay some tribute to the bird's very
rapid flight, and I can endorse these reports from my knowledge of the
i bird in the wild. It is however tragic that this attribute of speedy move-
; ment is frequently the cause of death. As it flies low generally, and
dodges through the trees it often mistakes the wall of a native house for
a space and dashes itself to death.

<bodyText confidence="0.985385634146342" page_id="58076328"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
[Ramphocelus icteronotus)
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
The Lemon-rumped Tanager is one of the eight species of velvet
Tanagers found in South America and Mexico. Its range is Panama,
West Colombia, Western Ecuador and N.W. Peru. It is said to inter-
breed with the Flame-rumped Tanager (.Ramphocelus flammigerus) on the
western slopes of the Andes in Colombia where males with orange rumps
and females with the chest tinged orange-scarlet are found.
The adult male Lemon-rumped Tanager is a deep glossy velvety-black
with the lower back, rump and upper tail coverts brilliant lemon-yellow.
The female is greyish-brown above, tinged olive; the lower back, rump,
upper tail coverts and underparts are a lighter lemon yellow and the
throat and sides of the head whitish.
We obtained a pair of Lemon-rumped Tanagers in the winter of 1965/6
in exchange for other Tanagers. The previous owner stated that the
pair had attempted to breed in a mixed aviary, but were unsuccessful due
to the competition for the limited live food supplied. After caging for
a while we turned the pair out into a lightly planted aviary measuring
6 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft. 3 in. high. This flight led into a small compartment
within a birdroom. The compartment measured 2 ft. x 2 ft. x 6 ft. 3 in.
high. The birdioom has an electric heater thermostatically controlled
to give a minimum temperature of about 40/45^. On the 26th April
1966 a broken egg was found in the flight. Various half-open nest-boxes
had been placed in the flight and also a small nest-basket near the roof
of the flight. It was in this basket the hen built a cup of grasses. It
was poorly constructed and seemed too small for the bird. Here she
laid one egg and incubated it from the 29th April until the 23rd May
when it was removed. It was fertile but " dead in shell ". She again
laid and commenced incubation on the 28th June, one chick was seen on
the 15th July but this disappeared the next day. No further breeding
attempt was made that year. The hen appeared to be an old bird so
that when an opportunity came in September to acquire another but
younger pair, we did so. The new cock died that night and the old cock
some months later, so we were left with two " hens ". However, during
the summer of 1967 the new " hen " developed male plumage and on
19th September 1967 we saw the old hen once again building a flimsy nest
in her nest-basket. Nothing came of the breeding attempt.
On 22nd April 1968 the old hen started carrying grasses to the basket
she had used before. This continued until 12th May when a soft shelled
egg was found in the shelter. Nest building continued and on the 22nd
May when she was in the shelter feeding, I checked the nest to find one

egg only. It was light blue with black flecks at the large end. Incubation
continued until 4th June when she abandoned the nest. The one egg
was found to have a hole in it. A search in the flight revealed some
eggshells so it looked as if three eggs had been laid in total. I replaced
the small basket with a slightly larger one, but she did not take to it and no
further breeding attempts were made in 1968. In 1969 no breeding was
attempted even though the new basket was replaced by the original one.
Both biids came through the following winter very well, outside in all
weathers except frosts, so about the middle of April 1970 when both
birds were in breeding condition they were moved to another and much
larger aviary. The flight measured 15 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft. high and also
led into a compartment within a birdroom. The compartment measures
4 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft. high. The adjacent aviary houses a pair of Rothchild's
I Mynahs. This time three nest-baskets were placed about 5 ft. 3 in. high
on the north wall of the shelter, and no baskets were placed in the flight.
By the 8th May the floor of the shelter was littered with nesting material
|j (hay and twigs) which had fallen from two of the baskets, her old original
one and the slightly larger one which she had ignored the previous two
years. 1 he third basket was larger still but she showed no interest in it.
1 Finally she chose the smallest basket and by the evening of the 21st IVIay
the nest was complete but this time the nesting material was higher and
the cup much deeper than evei before; one egg had been laid that day
and a second one was laid on the 23 rd May and she was seen to be incuba-
ting. We did not see the male bird take any part in the nesting activities
but the pair are very nervous, so much so that the door of the birdroom
had to be kept closed. Once it was opened the hen came off the nest.
However, on 1st and 2nd June she stayed on her nest whilst the food pot
was being changed. Two chicks hatched on the 3rd June, 14 days after
the first egg was laid. The weather was very hot and the temperature
in the birdroom was in the 8o*sF during this part of June. The next
two weeks were uneventful, the chicks feathered up and large quantities
of mealworms and maggots were supplied together with the normal diced
I fruit mixed with insectivorous food. The heads of both young birds
j muld be seen above the nest on the 14th June and at 6.45 a.m. next
morning one bird had left the nest and was on the floor and the other was
I oerched on the edge of the nest. They were quite small compared with
heir parents and coloured like the hen but paler. The compartment
Jide was shut with the parents inside and we thus made sure that no
, )ird could get into the flight. We just could not risk the young birds
[getting drowned in the first thunderstorm. This so often happens w T ith
} lviar y bred birds during the first few days out of the nest. The second
mung bird finally left the nest 3^ hours later. The weather was much
ooler, around 60 F in the daytime with the night temperature down to
|48 F but we were back to 80 F by the 18th June. The smaller of the
wo young birds which measured about 3 in. in length, was perching well

but the larger was always on the floor or on a log which had been placed
there. A closer look from a few feet away showed one leg dangling as if
broken. Whenever one approached the compartment both parents
uttered loud warning calls but the young birds themselves were very
placid. The adult birds seem to have no song at any time, only a loud
chirping when alarmed.
By the 22nd June the smaller of the two birds was making short flights
and perching high up and two days later the one with the broken leg had
followed, so we opened the slide and let all four birds enter the flight at
will, but shut them inside at night. By the 29th June it was difficult to
tell at a glance the young birds from their mother--they were so alike in
colouration and size. The next day the hen was seen to repair her nest
and spar with one of the young birds so we felt the time had come to
separate them from their parents. We caught them up and caged them
well away from their aviary. It was some hours before droppings showed
they were feeding themselves but at dusk both birds were at the feeding
pot. The fractured leg of the first bird out of the nest seemed to have
healed but it had been a bad break just above the joint and the bird had
difficulty in perching. On the 21st July we took it to a local veterinary
surgeon who successfully amputated the leg above the break. The bird
was soon perching and feeding well and seemed to have made a complete
recovery. However, on 16th August when in an aviary and after a heavy
rainstorm, it was found wet through on the grass and unable to fly. It
was picked up and placed on the floor of its shelter but when we returned
within the hour it was dead. It had apparently injured the stump
remaining from the amputation and died from loss of blood--a sad
ending.
In the meantime the parents had been supplied with more nesting
material and the nest was rebuilt by the hen, anyway we never saw the
male carrying any nesting material. The first egg of a clutch of two
was laid on 6th July and one day later she was incubating with the
temperature at 88*F. Two chicks hatched on the 19th July--again on
the 14th day since the first egg was laid. Both young birds left the nest
on the 1st August, the 14th day since they were hatched. This time no
legs were broken. I measured them next day, just 3 in. from the tip of
the beak to their Jin. long tails! The parents measure approximately
8 in. Again the parents were shut in the compartment and successfully
reared the two birds until we separated them on the 20th August, 20 days
after leaving the nest. They could feed themselves and after a few days
in a cage we put them in an aviary with the one survivor of the first clutch.
Very little live food is taken and this makes me wonder how much live
food was fed by the parents who are very insectivorous, particularly when
they are offered mealworms. However, on reflection I can recall occasions
during the nestling stage when a whole pot of mealworms and gentles
would be consumed in a few hours and as gentles have never been

particularly relished by the adult birds, I am sure these have been fed to
the youngsters. The three young birds are almost indistinguishable
from each other (ist September 1970) either in colouring or in size, being
almost fully grown. There are patches of lemon amongst the whitish
underparts, but we can see no sexual differences. The parents show no
signs of nesting again though as yet they have not commenced to moult.

BEHAVIOUR NOTES ON THE
BARRED AND ANDALUSIAN HEMIPODES
(Turnix suscitalor and Turnix sylvatica )
T
By Jeffrey Trollope (Hounslow, Middlesex, England)
Introduction
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99697394117647" page_id="58076331"  page_num="219" year="" vol="">
The reproductive behaviour of the genus Turnix is accepted as being
polyandrous. Ali (1964) writes of the larger and more brightly-coloured
hens of T. suscitator fighting rival females for possession of a cock, laying
a clutch of eggs and leaving the cock to incubate and rear the chicks after
hatching. Whistler (1963) selects T. sylvatica as representative of the
genus with the same reproductive behaviour.
Sutter (1964) in an article on the genus, states that, although the cock
incubates and rears the chicks, the hen may occasionally assist during a
few days after hatching. He suggests that there is evidence from field
observations that the hen lays several sets of eggs to be attended by
different cocks.
This paper is based on two seasons observations on captive T. suscitator
the Barred Hemipode or Bustard Quail. Some preliminary notes have
also been made on T. sylvatica , the Andalusian Hemipode, also known as
the Little Buttonquail or Striped Buttonquail. From the examination
of skins, it would appear that the birds are of the sub-species T. suscitator
taigoor and T. sylvatica dussumier.

The information on T. suscitator consisted of notes on three adults and
four broods of chicks, some of which were watched at the adult stage. All
observations were made from a shed which acted as an efficient " hide
The birds were housed in a planted aviary 12 ft. x 8 ft. x 8 ft.
The notes on T. sylvatica were limited, as these birds did not breed,
although eggs were laid at random. Two pairs were observed for one
season, one pair housed in the aviary mentioned above, the other in a
smaller planted aviary 7 ft. x 5 ft. X 6 ft. The shed acting as a hide for the
birds in the large aviary only. Their behaviour was recorded during
observation and later, transcribed into a log-book.
Behaviour and Reproduction
As previously described in Trollope (1967), when T. suscitator were
first bred, I removed the hen when the chicks were seven days old, as
the hen showed no signs of interacting with the chicks or cock. The pair
bond had been strong between the adult birds until the chicks hatched.
After the chicks were fully grown and removed from the cock, I replaced
hen "A" with hen " B ". As stated I was perhaps too hasty in removing
the original hen, but the literature available indicated the possibility of the
dominant hen causing trouble.
On breeding Turnix tanki, the Yellow-legged Buttonquail, Seth-Smith
(1903) observed that the hen did not help with the rearing of the chicks.
However, he separated the hen, as she was eating the food meant for the
chicks. The date of separation was not given, but one chick died at three
days, presumably after removal of the hen.
In his paper on Turnix varia , the " Painted Quail " (1905) the hen was
also removed after the chicks hatched, no date was given. However, it is
interesting to note that courtship feeding, or " tit-bitting " was observed,
the hen feeding the cock, or rather offering food, as I have noted with
T. suscitator.
As shown in the table after the first brood was reared, with the three
succeeding broods, the hen was left with the cock and chicks.
Contrary to my impressions, gained from the brief time that the hen
was left with the first brood, and limited reference to the literature, the
hen fed the chicks and retained a strong pair bond with the cock. At
night they would roost together in the clumped position, the chicks
covered by cock and hen up to the age of about 14 days. From this age
a lateral-to-lateral clumping position was usually adopted, but sometimes
the hen would still try to cover one or two chicks, the cock struggling to
cover the remaining chick or chicks.
During daylight, the hen would feed all the chicks, but as they grew
older a pattern of the hen " adopting " one or two chicks seemed to
develop.

222 J. TROLLOPE--BEHAVIOUR OF BARRED AND ANDALUSIAN HEMIPODES
The whole family would dust-bathe and sun-bathe together, allo-
preening occurred between the adult pair, both adults preening the chicks.
Dharmakumarsinji (1945) reports that the hen fed the young and clumped
with the chicks and cock in captivity. He also saw hen, cock and young
together in the wild. The birds concerned were Turnix suscitator taigoor.
Introduction of Hen to Two Cocks ( T . suscitator )
Although the value of an attempt to establish a " polyandrous group "
in a small aviary 12 ft. x 8 ft. x 8 ft. was in doubt, I thought the observa-
tions might prove interesting. 1 wo cocks were therefore released into
the aviary on the 25th June, 1968. During the day they showed a good
deal of social interaction clumping together and allo-preening. The next
day hen " B " was released, she followed each cock alternately, with the
normal locomotion, a rapid " pigeon-like " walk; the she would break
into a run, chasing a cock with her dorsal and lateral feathers erect. She
pecked at their tails, sometimes holding the tail in her bill and pulling
the cock up short. When he pulled free the chase would be resumed.
During the chasing the pursued cock would give a sharp tuk-tuk
but the hen was silent. That evening, the hen roosted in the clumped
position with one cock, the other cock roosting on the other side of the
aviary. The cocks were fighting the following morning and although no
damage was visible, I removed the cock that she had roosted with the
previous evening.
Introduction of a Second Cock ( T . sylvatica)
With this species, I decided to try to introduce a cock in the same
aviary as an established pair. T he pair concerned were released in the
aviary mentioned above on 3 IS ^ March 1969 anc ^ a second cock was
released on the 31st May 1969. He w r as immediately attacked by the
hen, who rushed at him, giving jabs at his head and nape. He laid flat
on the ground, the posture like that of the alarm crouch described by
Harrison (1965) for Excalfactoria chinensis . This posture apparently
acted as an efficient "cut-off" or inhibitor for aggression, as the hen
walked away. The cock laid perfectly still for about one minute but when
he began to walk he w^as attacked by the mated cock, and again by the hen.
Both these attacks had the same pattern as the first, a rush, followed by
jabs at the head and nape. I then removed the introduced cock to prevent
injury.
Voice
Turnix suscitator
The major vocalization for this species (or perhaps the most significant
vocal signal) is the " purring " call, written as Krrrrrrirr by Henry
(1955). Both adult hens observed would give this call at frequent
intervals. When walking they would suddenly freeze in an upright

Posture, stretch the neck, then slowly lower the head, the bill nearly
touching the ground, and as the head is lowered the " purring " call is
given. Ali (1964) gives the function of this call as a challenge to other
hens and to announce herself to a cock.
During the first breeding hen A developed a pendulous swelling
from the throat, which I thought might be due to the inflatable bulb of
the oesophagus and tracheal enlargement mentioned by Sutter (1964).
However, this swelling proved to be an enlargement of the crop.

Tiirnix suscitator
A harsh chook-chook " was given by the cocks during fighting, or
when I entered the aviary after the chicks had hatched. The cock would
always threaten and rush in my direction, sometimes pecking at my feet.
Other vocalizations lor T. suscitator are given in Trollope (1967).

and swelling with each note, the bill pointing towards the ground, but
neck and head are not lowered as with T. suscitator.
The function of this call is said to attract the cock (Whistler, 1963).
W ith the two pairs of T. sylvatica I watched, the hen would give this call
; facing the direction of the cock's position in the aviary. The cock would
[ ans wer with a sharp " tuc-tuc-tuc ", walk rapidly towards the hen, and
a lateral-lateral clumping position would be adopted, and often allo-
preening would take place. The hens would also respond to the cock's
call with the " hoo-hoo " note, the cocks walking towards the hens.

<bodyText confidence="0.977111888888889" page_id="58076336"  page_num="224" year="" vol="">
Although in adjoining aviaries when a hen gave a call, this was not taken
up by the neighbouring hen, or at least only after such a time lag that
would suggest there was no " challenge " response. Other calls are a
kestrel-like high-pitched " kee-kee-kee-kee " given only by the cocks,
the situations in which this call has occurred suggesting it is an alarm note.
A low-pitched " cree-cree-cree " is given by both birds when in cover
and often in the lateral-lateral clumped position.
To summarize these notes on vocalizations, the most obvious point is
the great difference between the " purring note " of the hen T. suscitator
and the " booming " note of the hen T. sylvatica , together with the differ-
ence in posture. The hen's call note in T. tanki is similar to that of
T. suscitator (Ali, 1964). It would be interesting to see if they also have
the same posture, as sexual dimorphism in the female plumage of T.
suscitator and T. tanki , is more marked than in T. sylvatica.
Nesting
T. suscitator
Nests are usually a fairly well-made cup of whatever material was
available. Bits of dead weed, dried grass, green stems, dead convolvulus,
fine twigs, green and dead bits of irises and pine needles were all used at
times. On two occasions a canopy of stems were pulled out from a weed
pile, almost obscuring the sitting cock.
Both sexes took part in nest-building which was rapidly completed.
Material was pulled to the site with sharp jerks over the " shoulder , the
partner in the nest pulling stems around with this same sharp jerk. The
cock spending more time in the nest than the hen. The pair would also
make stem-jerking movements without stems, this always happened when
one partner was in the nest pulling with real stems.

E&amp;gt;ust- and Sun-Bathing
T. suscitator and T. sylvatica
Dust-bathing was a " social " affair for both species, a hurried scuffling
with the feathers fluffed out, alternate sides of the head and body being
rubbed on the ground. Somteimes a back kick with one leg would turn
the body round in a " fixed pivot ".
Sun-bathing was also social, usually a lateral-lateral clumping position
would be adopted, and then one bird would move a few inches away fully
opening both wings simultaneously, so that the dorsal surfaces' were
exposed to the sun. One-wing exposure was also seen, the bird lying on
its side. b

Only once has a form of display been observed and this was brief. The
hen ran to the cock who was facing her and she then made a few rapid
steps to one side, then to the other, whilst the cock squatted. These
brief " rushes " were interspersed with the " pivot turn " also seen in

This is a curious movement, the bird will be walking in a " normal "
manner, and suddenly stop, with the legs " frozen " in a stride. The body
is then swayed forwards and back, about three or four times, then loco-
motion proceeds.

I have only seen hens make this movement. Dharmakumarsinji (1945)
mentions it and thinks it may be a leaf movement simulation, acting as
camouflage for the bird.

The difficulties involved in carrying out field studies of birds such as
Hemipodes must be formidable. Studies in captivity also have the
problems of providing a suitable environment and sufficient space for
"natural" reproductive behaviour to occur. However, the fact that
three broods of T. suscitator were reared with the hen retaining a strong
pair bond with the cock, and tending the chicks, suggests that this may
happen in the wild.
The habitats of the genus are varied, Sutter (1964) lists arid or marshy
grass and brush country, savannas, and more open woodland. Whistler
(1963) records the habitat of T. sylvatica dussumier as cornfields and
stretches of grassy plain; although it can be found in any type of low
herbage and open scrub jungle.
T. sylvatica has a range extending from South-Western Europe, Africa
and Asia. T. suscitator has an extensive range in India and Eastern Asia.
With such varied habitats, it is possible that in some species of Titrmx
the evolution of polyandry is such that the hen will fulfil a further role in
the reproductive pattern other than establishing a territory and lading the
eggs. This would occur if environmental pressures demand her addi-
tional care for the chicks, to ensure their survival in "borderline"
conditions. Instead of following the " normal " pattern of a brief
association with a number of cocks, which terminates after a clutch oi
eggs are laid, under " optimum conditions.
In support of this theory of continued association by the hen with the
cock and chicks, we have the observations of Dharmakumarsinhji (1945).
It is interesting to note that when I described the first breeding and early
removal of the hen, as she had no interaction with the chicks, he was kind
enough to show interest, and wrote to me, remarking that the contrast
in the behaviour of T. suscitator in the wild and as then observed by me
in captivity was noteworthy.
Summary
The reproductive behaviour of captive T. suscitator is described, also
some preliminary observations on the behaviour of captive T. sylvatica.
The behaviour of T. suscitator in captivity suggests the possibility that
the female in the wild may help to rear chicks and retain a pair bond
with the male.

By J. Doughty (Cannock, Staffordshire, England)
(This data was sent to ASPEBA by a member but in view of ,ts detail was felt
to be of interest to a wider range of aviculturists.) &apos; X
A pair of Stonechats, Saxicola torquata , was overwintered in an aviarv
24 ft. x 7 ft. and 6 ft. 6 in. high. The birds were fed on maggots and
pupae and adult blowflies, and a mixture of Haith's insectile food and
1 ard-boiled egg to which was added Vit-min mineral powder As spring
wore on the diet was supplemented by insects which entered the aviarv
By February the cock began to display to the hen, which at times was
decidedly aggressive. The display consisted of sudden dashes at the hen
 |out-stretched head, open beak, quivering wings and a displav of
the white secondaries. The hen tended to dodge these onslaughts/ but
on many occasions she stood her ground, whereupon the cock seemed to
ance around her uttering a series of squeaky notes. In all of this
courtship display the hen played a passive role, and only responded in a
high-spirited manner with jerking tail and flipping wings so typical of the
species. In between these ardent displays the cock sang from a high

completed the cock entered and inspected at least four potential nesting
sites. Before entering he held his wings high in a quivering fashion
! uttering an " eurring " noise very similar to that of the cock Bullfinch
when encouraging the hen to nest. When inside the hollow the cock
made a high-pitched warble. The hen often followed him down and
entered the sites chosen. It was noticed that in the nesting area the
j roles were ^versed and it was the hen who became dominant; the cock
always giving way to her in this area of their territory.

22 8 J. DOUGHTY--BREEDING THE STONECHAT, 197 *
The hen eventually chose one of the sites inspected by the cock, which
was at the base of the slope and under a particular heavy clod. She
enlarged the chosen position and on the nth April she began the founda-
tions of the nest; mainly using dead leaves, together with grass bents,
both fine and coarse rootlets, hair and other soft fibrous material. She
completed the nest on the 15th April.
During the nest-building operations the cock sang from his favourite
high perch above the nest; but if the hen stayed in the nest for some time
he invariably flew down to investigate. Sometimes he would follow the
hen to the nest and seemed to stand watch on a bramble slightly above
the nest. It was also noticed that if the hen accidently dropped a piece
of material near to the site the cock removed it to the extremities of the
aviary. This tidying up operation on the part of the cock would seem
to be a protection measure against enemies, who might use such clues to
locate the nest. At times he also encouraged the hen to continue building
by flying by her in quick direct flight, carrying a piece of material, usually
dctid bracken.
Throughout this period the birds showed no fear or resentment at my
presence; the hen often picking up nesting material from near my feet.
On my inspecting the nest no alarm was shown by either bird.
On the 17th April she began laying, and then on consecutive days until
April 22nd when a clutch of six was completed. However, she did not
begin incubation, and it was subsequently discovered that a cat had been
seen on top of the aviary, which may account for her desertion. Six days
later, when it was obvious that she had deserted the eggs, these and the
nest were removed.
On the 30th April she began building a second nest, but this time in a
depression near the top of the slope and by the 10th May she had completed
a clutch of five eggs. She began incubation on laying the fifth egg. The
only problem to arise during incubation was that of cats. On noticing a
cat, no matter the distance, the cock invariably called the hen off the nest
by using a high-pitched "whibbing " note and flying across the nest-site
in fast direct flight. On 23rd May, between 2.00 and 6.00 p.m. four eggs
hatched and the fifth some time later.
For the first two days the cock fed the hen on the nest, who transferred
the food to the young; she at no time for these days took food to the nest,
although when she came off to feed the cock would feed the young directly.
His favourite food at that time was the newly-emerged greenbottle fly,
which being soft and small seemed ideal. He also fed hard-boiled egg
to the hen and young, but for the most part rejected the fully developed
greenbottle and bluebottle, which he appeared to test for softness before
rejecting them. However, it was noticed that if more suitable foods were
not available he would then break up a bluebottle and feed the dismem-
bered parts to the young.
On the third day the hen would often leave the nest after receiving

food from the cock, fly around the aviary, kill the offering and often add
to it herself and then return to the nest to feed the nestlings. This went
on until the eighth day although by now the hen was feeding the young
without any encouragement from the cock. The main food taken to the
nest from the fourth day consisted of bluebottles, but only those newly
emerged which were soft; maggots which they seemed to prefer rolled
which softened their structure; hard-boiled egg, and pieces of grit and
cuttlefish bone. Both birds, but more especially the cock, would often
take a mixture of these foods to the chicks. By the 6th day large quantities
ot these foods were being fed and the nestlings were encouraged to gape
by the adult birds making a " clucking " sound. They seemed to know
1 when . the y* un g birds had had enough, since on making this noise and
[ receiving n o response the birds would eat the food themselves. I had
found that placing little piles of egg around the aviary and scattering
# ^*r ed maggots about the aviary encouraged the birds to feed since
8 t0 bnd food the y had to be more peripatetic and this was more akin to
conditions in the wild. However, by the eighth day large quantities of
the fu ly developed bluebottle were being fed, which was fortunate since
1 had large numbers of these which were only allowed to escape from the
; tin, one or two at a time, through a small aperture I had made_sur-
prisingly, however, they still refused the fully-grown greenbottle.
On the i 4 th day the young birds began to stand outside the nest and on
the 16th day they left the nest and became dispersed in the vegetation.
It was now found there were four cocks and a hen; three of which were
large and vigorous, and two small and stunted, which died two days later
despite constant attention by both parents. When the birds were
twenty-three days old, although still being fed by the adults, they were
[taken from the aviary, because by that time the hen had completed her
 |:hlrd nest and had laid two e gg s of the clutch and it was felt that the cock
;youM soon decide his offspring were ready for independence, and his
ittempts to demonstrate this to the young might have resulted in death
&amp;gt;r injury to the young in the confines of an aviary. The young birds
 |vere placed in a four-foot box-cage and were soon eating the soft food
md maggots which I had placed in one container.
By the 19th June the hen had laid her sixth egg (seventeenth in all) and
lad begun incubation the day before. This third nest had been built
within nine inches of a bellow Wagtail's nest containing five eggs, and
his later presented an unlooked-for problem.
! Two days before his own young hatched the cock Stonechat had become
rustrated by the delay in hatching of his own young, and had transferred
is affections to the yellow wagtails, whose large gapes poking out of the
egetation he could not resist. Thus by the time his six young hatched
n the 2nd July he was spending all his time feeding the Yellow Wagtails,
nd it was rather an amusing sight to see both wagtails and a Stonechat
ceding the young of the former; the hen Wagtail and Stonechat often

being at the nest at the same time. Because of this strange turn of events
it was decided to transfer the young Wagtails (io days old) and their
parents to a cage. Unfortunately in the confines of a cage the adults
fought viciously; they had even tended to be quarrelsome in the aviary.
The hen bird was removed, since it had been noticed in the aviary that
the cock Wagtail was more willing to feed soft food, and thus the cock
finished the task of rearing. Five beautiful young Wagtails left the nest
bowl on 7th July and began to feed themselves between ioth and i ith July.
Meanwhile the cock Stonechat, now the distraction had been removed,
returned to his paternal duties. However, on the 5th July the six young
Stonechats died. This may have been due to the cock's earlier confusion
but I believe the main reason was due to the absence of soft-bodied flies,
which had been available at the time of the successful rearing. This was
bad management on my part in not having a hatch of flies prepared
for this third nest. The Wagtails had been reared basically on the last
" hatch " of greenbottles I had prepared.
At the time of writing this report the cock Stonechat is still displaying
to the hen and encouraging her to nest. However, I hope that she resists,
as I believe she has done more than enough for one year.

Two pairs of Alpine Chough were purchased from a Continental dealer
in 1965. Both pairs were subsequently released in the larger of the two
walk-through aviaries in the Park. In the spring of 1968 one pair
constructed a substantial nest of sticks on top of a nest-box which had
been placed inside a large cavity in an artificial rock-work cliff. Unfor-
tunately the eggs were stolen by some Azure-winged Magpies Cyanop&amp;a
cyanus cooki (Bonaparte) kept in the same aviary. Early in 1969 the
Magpies were removed and the two pairs of Choughs divided one pan
remaining in the walk-through aviary and one pair being removed to a
large planted pheasant pen measuring 54 ft. in length and 27 ft. in width.
This pen has a wooden hut in it measuring 9 ft. x 6 ft. in floor area, and
the Choughs could enter it through a small hole at the top giving access
to an inside ledge. An open nest-box 12 in. square was placed in one
corner of the hut 6 ft. above the ground. The birds nested in the box
and hatched five chicks, one of which died after 14 days. The other four

chicks were removed and an attempt was made to hand-rear them, but
this failed. The pair remaining in the walk-through aviary did not
attempt to breed in 1969.
This year (1970) the pair in the pheasant aviary again built a nest of
twigs in the open nest-box and on 15th April it contained four eggs
which hatched on 1st May. Three young Choughs fledged on 23 rd May,
but a month later one of them succumbed to gapes. The remaining two
are, at the time of writing (August), quite independent and their bills have
changed from dull greyish-brown to bright yellow. Their legs are also
beginning to acquire the reddish colour of the adult.
It was noticed that the parent birds became extremely selective in
their feeding when rearing young, and would take virtually nothing but
mealworms. These were fed ad lib. and at one stage were being consumed
at the rate of nearly half a pound daily. A high protein supplement in
the form of Casilan (Glaxo) was sprinkled over the mealworms every day.
The pair in the walk-through aviary nested twice during the spring of
1970; on the first occasion the eggs appeared to be infertile, but the
birds laid again and had four eggs on 15th June from which three young
hatched on 29th June. Two of the young died, possibly because the
adults were constantly disturbed by people passing through the aviary.
One young survived to fledge and has since become independent despite
the fact that it has one deformed toe.
As described above, the Alpine Chough, Pyrrhocorax g. graculus , has
been bred at the Norfolk Wildlife Park. It is believed this may be a
first success.

By Grenville Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
Alternatively known as " Go-Away Birds ", Grey Touracos inhabit the
dry thornbush country of Angola, stretching eastwards to Tanzania and
south to Cape Province. The birds in our collection came from the
vicinity of Luanda in Angola, being presented to the Zoo in May 1967.
Large grey birds with delicate hair-like crests, black bill and legs, our
Touracos are fed upon a mixed diet of all available fruits, offered chopped
and whole, and our basic bread, milk, multivitamin mixture together with
minced boiled egg, minced meat and meal worms. Fresh green branches
of Hawthorn are always available and the birds quickly strip these of
young leaves and buds. Convolvulus and Hebe ( Scrophulariaceae )
foliage are also readily taken.
The first signs of courtship activity took place in August 1969 after
the birds had been moved from their flight in the Tropical Bird House
to a very large outside aviary. Two pairs of birds were seen feeding each
other at this time and twigs were carried, though it seems with no definite
purpose. By the 9th August one of the pairs had become very aggressive,
chasing the other birds continuously. The chased birds were quickly
removed but beyond further twig-carrying no other breeding behaviour
was observed.
In the autumn all the birds were reunited in the Birdroom without
any aggression being shown. All were ringed at this time with differently
coloured celluloid rings.
On the 29th March this year one of the birds was seen tugging at small
twigs which had been left attached to their perches. A large quantity of
fine (thornless) Hawthorn and Oak twigs were scattered about over the
flight floor and a close watch maintained. Very quickly the female (as it
turned out to be) flew down to investigate and selected a Hawthorn twig,
which she carried up to a wire nesting platform about 7 ft. high, resting
upon the fork of a branch, and almost entirely hidden from view by a
conifer branch. The nest which she and her mate proceeded to build
was made entirely out of Hawthorn twigs, the Oak and various other bits
and pieces lying about were completely ignored.
The pair again became aggressive and started to chase the other
Touracos, which necessitated the latters' removal from the aviary.
At 11.30 on the 9th April mating was observed for the first time and
again on the 18th and 28th April. Though the brooding pattern was
started on the 27th April, the female usually brooding overnight, with

ver y irregular change-overs in the day. The first egg was not laid
until the 1st May, the second and third following on alternate days.
A changeover ritual was frequently observed during the incubation
period of 28 days. The non-brooding bird on approaching the nest,
would shake its head vigorously, the brooding bird responding immedi-
ately by shaking its head briefly and leaving the nest. Feeding of the
brooding bird by its mate sometimes took place at this time, the visitor
quickly taking the place of its mate upon the nest.
On the 29th May two chicks were observed in the nest, the third egg
hatching two days later on 3 ist May. The last chick was removed from
the nest and examined. Its pink flesh was well covered with charcoal
grey down, the bill pink with a dark grey tip and the legs were greyish-pink
j, with grey feet. The inside of the mouth was bright pink, eyes were
opaque blue-grey with a white egg tooth and tiny white claws on the alula
were also seen. The chicks weight was 14J gms., its overall length 3 in.
For the first few days it appeared that the only food given to the young
was regurgitated greenfood, but when the smallest chick was 10 days old,
it was again removed and re-examined at which time it regurgitated three
: large pellets (2 in. long weighing 4-6 gms.), which upon examination
jl revealed that the birds were being fed on greenfood, boiled egg and
raisins. At this time the chick weighed yi gms. (before regurgitating
the pellets), had a tail about 1 in. long and was pretty well covered by
sprouting pin feathers.
I At eighteen days old regurgitated banana was being fed to the young
and at 21 days old they left the nest (19th June) though they had been
climbing around the branches next to it for four days.
O n 3 rc i July the chicks were seen eating Hawthorn leaves and two days
later were seen pecking at a whole (skinned) orange.
On 17th July the chicks were seen eating from the feed dishes and were
then considered to be self-supporting; though they continued to beg food
from their parents until 27th July when they were moved to another aviary.
At the time of writing the adults are again incubating a clutch of three,
j the first egg being laid two days after the young were removed, 29th July.

BREEDING THE DOUBLE YELLOW-HEADED

(.Amazona ochrocephala oratrix )
By Clifford Smith (Denholme, Nr. Bradford, Yorkshire, England)
These two birds were purchased in 1966, newly imported and obviously
young birds as they had only a small amount of yellow on the front of the
head. Each year the amount of yellow on the head has increased so
that by 1970 the whole of the head and nape is completely yellow and they
are very handsome birds, the most colourful of the Amazons, in my
opinion. There is no difference in the colouring of the male and female,
each having red and yellow feathers on the wing butts. The difference
in head size has become more pronounced over the years and there is now
no difficulty in recognizing the cock by his broader beak and wider and j
flatter head. . ,
As it was summer when these birds arrived they were kept in the
birdroom for about a fortnight and then released into a 12 ft. long x 6 ft.
wide x 7 ft. high flight with a 6 ft. x 4 ft. shelter in the birdroom.
For the first winter they were encouraged to sleep in the shelter but
after that they prefered to roost outside, only using the shelter for feeding
and the afternoon siesta.
The flight is wooden framed and wired with i in. x i in. x 16 gauge
Twihveld but they have made no attempt to chew the woodwork or the
wire
They are no more noisy than the Yellow Fronts and the Blue Fronts,
their outbursts being confined to probably 15 minutes morning and
The nest-box was introduced in 1969 and as a grandfather clock
nest box had proved successful with the Yellow Fronted Amazons in
1967 (Avicultural Magazine, November 1969), a similar type box
seemed to be the best approach. , , ,
Early in June the hen began to show interest in the box and soon a
small pile of excavated filling was seen on the floor of the flight below the
entrance hole. The hen then disappeared into the box and was only
occasionally seen for a short period in the evenings. She sat two eggs
very conscientiously for five weeks, when they were removed and proven
to be clear. Reference to previous breeding reports of my lellow
Fronted Amazons and African Greys showed exactly the same results,
a trial run before the successful year.
So when the Double Yellows began preparing their nest in early May,
hopes were high that 1970 would confirm my observations.
The first egg was laid on 7th May, followed by another three within
the week. Incubation commenced with the first egg and after two weeks

a quick inspection, while the hen was in the shelter feeding, showed that
the eggs appeared fertile although they were not handled at that stage.
The sound of the young being fed was first heard on the 5th June but
no opportunity to inspect presented itself until the 14th June, when two
chicks and two eggs were seen.
The young were covered with grey down. Very little was heard from
the log after the first week. The birds were inspected each week as
conditions allowed; and each time saw quick growth and the appearance
of feathers, the yellow on the forehead soon becoming visible. They left
the nest on the 5th August within an hour of each other and are now
feeding on their own.
The young are perfectly feathered and strong on the wing.
Their colouring is all green with a patch of yellow about the size of a
shilling on the forehead; no colouring to the wing butts or wings; a white
beak and white feet, and dark brown eyes.
They were fed the same diet as the Yellow Fronts, normal dry seed
of sunflower, safflower, hemp, wheat and oats in the shelter, but soaked
seed as above thrown on the floor of the flight. A shortage of chickweed
due to dry conditions was balanced by extra dandelion, groundsel and
later by persicaria and sow-thistle.
Apple, grapes and peanuts were offered; but only taken after the
soaked seed and green food had been cleared. All the Amazons love a
slice of orange but this is fed very sparingly.
Each end of the flight is covered for a distance of 3 ft. and the adults
and young all roost together at one end; and as the young Yellow Fronts
have slept out through the winters in previous years, unless they show any
signs of discomfort the Double Yellows will be allowed to do the same.
The above dates would suggest an incubation period of 21 to 24 days with
approximately 70 days in the nest-box after hatching and three to four
weeks to independence. The longer the period the young are left with
the parents the greater seems to be the advantage, as they appear to make
quicker pi ogress.
As described above, Mr. Clifford Smith has bred the Double Yellow-
headed Amazon, Amazona ochrocephala oratrix. It is believed that this
may be a first success.

COCKATOO)

(Cacatua ( Licmetis) tenuirostris)
By Alan Lendon (Adelaide, Australia)
The true Corella is a cockatoo with a moderately restricted habitat
which may well be contracting in the face of pastoral development. Its
present stronghold is the western district of the State of Victoria, from
the vicinity of Port Phillip Bay (on rare occasions nowadays) to the South
Australian border, which it transgresses for a short distance, especially in
the vicinity of Naracoorte and Penola. The range in New South Wales
has never been precisely defined but it is known to occur, somewhat
sparsely, in the Riverina district and along the course of the Lachlan and
Murrumbidgee Rivers. In my youth, the Sydney birdshops invariably
had nestling Corellas for sale at the appropriate season, presumably
obtained within the State, but the source was never reliably disclosed.
The Corella, with its elongated upper mandible which is an adaptation
for digging up bulbs, is obviously closely related to the much commoner
and more widespread Little Corella or Bare-eyed Cockatoo (C. sanguined)
but, as far as I have been able to ascertain, the two species do not make
contact. In Western Australia, the form known as pastinator , which
lacks the red crescent on the throat, was originally considered a valid
species and was later regarded as a subspecies of tenuirostris and has more
recently still been treated as a subspecies of sanguinea. This bird is
sparsely distributed nowadays in the south-west corner of the State and
is more plentiful north of Perth along the coastal strip, coming in contact
with sanguinea at the northern extremity of its range, in the vicinity of
Geraldton, and reputedly interbreeding.
I had always been attracted to this somewhat grotesque looking species
but had never possessed a specimen, although it is not uncommon as a
cagebird and reputedly an excellent talker. In December 1967, my elder
son arrived home with a pair of these birds which he had obtained from
a mixed collection of parrots and cockatoos exhibited at a service station,
with the story that they had attempted to breed and had actually laid
eggs during the previous season. A less likely breeding pair at first
acquaintance could hardly be imagined; the cock being very timid and
unable to fly on account of a damaged wing and the hen being obviously
hand-reared, tame and with a strong tendency to human fixation and a
repertoire consisting of a monotonously repeated " Hello Cocky
However, they appeared to be well-mated and frequently indulged in
mutual preening.

measuring 5  |ft. x 31 ft. x 8 ft.; the cock being provided with a perch
which enabled him to clamber into the shelter.
In August 1968, they were supplied with a hollow log about five feet
long with an internal diameter of about six inches and an inspection hole
near the lower end. This was suspended obliquely in the shelter and in
close proximity to a perch to enable easy access on the part of the cock.
An immediate interest was evinced and the hen spent a considerable
amount of time in it from the start. From this time onward, mating was
frequently observed and the first egg was seen on 22nd September and
the second on the following day; it was not until four days later that a
further opportunity to inspect the nest occurred and revealed a third egg *
it is to be presumed that they were laid with either two or three day inter-
vals between each. Incubation appeared to commence with the second
egg and as is the case with most cockatoos (excluding the " blacks ") the
cock carried out the task for most of the day and the hen in the early
morning, late afternoon and at night. Two of the eggs were fertile and
the first hatched on 16th October and the second the following day, after
an incubation period of approximately 24 days. One of the chicks,
presumably the younger, died after about a week but the other flourished
and ultimately left the nest on 10th December, approximately seven weeks
after hatching. It flew well from the start but was appreciably smaller
than the parents, with a considerably shorter upper mandible and a
slightly less obvious red crescent on the upper chest. Although both
parents fed the young bird whilst it was in the nest, after it emerged the
hen rarely did so but the cock continued to do so on demand for several
weeks, although the youngster fed itself and was deemed independent
after about three weeks. Soon after this the cock developed an aversion
to the hen and pursued her relentlessly around the aviary; fortunately
for her he was unable to catch up with her on account of his flightlessness.
The food supplied consisted of a seed mixture of sunflower seed,
hulled oats and canary seed. In addition, a plentiful supply of nutweed
(Romulea rosea) was given, together with thistle and seeding grasses.
An occasional peanut was relished.
The young bird soon became quite tame and would take a peanut from
the fingers, as the hen had always done. At about the same stage it
became very noisy and the parents, who had always indulged in a pre-
roosting screeching session, somewhat increased their vocal propensities,
so I presented them to the Adelaide Zoo, where they were satisfactorily
housed and it is to be hoped that they will continue to breed and add to
that institution's already long list of psittacine successes. However,
although eggs were laid in 1969, no results were obtained.
At about the same time, I borrowed a tame bird, of unknown sex, as
a companion for the young bird but it proved ill at ease in an aviary and
unwilling to fly, in addition to appearing terrified of the youngster. This
condition lessened somewhat after a time but they never really became

friendly and after several weeks, the young bird still being very noisy,
I sent them both to the owner of the tame bird, and they now occupy an
aviary with several others of the species.
I was quite unable to sex the young bird with any certainty in the early
stages although I had a feeling that it was probably a hen; later I was not
so sure but looking at it again when it was about a year old I felt that the
original opinion was correct. This species is one of the cockatoos which
does not exhibit any difference in the colour of the iris and although the
sexes can be picked in a mated pair, I think it is pure guesswork in the case
of a single bird.
I had not been able to find any convincing record of the previous
breeding of this species in captivity other than those in the San Diego Zoo
in 1959'and i960 and I had suspected that the young might have been
partly hand-reared, as is often the case there; however, Mr. K. C. Lint
informs me that this was not so. Following publication of a brief account
of my success in Bird Keeping in Australia a correspondent reported the
outstanding achievement of Mrs. C. Pullan of Wellington, New Zealand,
whose birds successively reared one, two, two and three young in t e
years 1965 to 1968.

BREEDING THE LESSER SULPHUR-CRESTED
COCKATOO
By Clifford Smith (Denholme, Yorkshire, England).
My Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, Cacatua sulphured sulphured ,

were purchased in 1962, the cock having been a pet bird which had
become too playful with its beak, hence the reason for selling. A few
months elapsed after I bought him before a hen was obtained, for cockatoos
were not too plentiful at this time. The male has jet black eyes and the
hen's are reddish-brown. Apart from the eye colour there is no other-
obvious difference either in colour or size.
Over the years the birds were kept in the same aviary, 12 x 5 x 7 ft. high,
and various nest-boxes were introduced, but although they visited the
boxes occasionally they never made any attempt to breed. However, in
1969 after the young Citron-crested Cockatoos which were in the next
flight to the Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos left the nest, there appearet
to be more than the usual amount of bickering and so it was decided to
give them a move.
A 20 x4 ft. flight was made available and early in 1970 a natural log
2 feet in diameter and only 2 ft. 6 ins. high, resting on a concrete paving slab
supported on a 4 foot post was fixed in the flight with no overhead coven
The log was an open cylinder resting on the concrete slab, with a layer or

peat and rotted wood in the bottom, a slab of wood on the top, and a
square entrance hole near the top with a projecting perch just below it.
Owing to various factors such as fixing the log, and its shape, there was
no alternative but to have it with the entrance facing east.
The birds soon settled down in the new aviary but it was not until
1st June that the hen disappeared into the box; although she had been
making numerous visits for a month before that. She was not seen for
a week, so it was assumed that she was incubating. The cock visited the
nest-box to feed her, and although she was seen out for short periods
during the second week, no chance was given to make an inspection.
As the walls of the log were nearly 6 inches thick it had been impossible
to make an inspection door, so that when the absence of the hen allowed
a quick look to be taken, it had to be through the entrance hole. This
revealed eggs, but only a quick glance was possible since the cock was
attacking fiercely, and any further disturbance seemed pointless.
At the end of June, although no sound of feeding had been heard, the
cock was continually in and out of the log and his breast feathers were
matted and wet after each visit, which is usually a sign that young are
being fed. As well as the usual supply of dry seed in the shelter, large
quantities of soaked sunflower, safflower, wheat and oats were thrown
onto the floor of the flight. In addition what chickweed was available,
together with dandelion roots, leaves and seeding heads were fed twice
each day. The birds showed no interest in fruit or nuts but took some
stale bread soaked in honey.
A youngster left the nest on 30th August but it was another week
before the second one appeared. They were exact replicas of their
parents and only slightly smaller, and were able to fly the full length of
the aviary within minutes. They are now completely independent but
will remain with their parents as long as possible.
Five pairs of cockatoos have reared young this year, along with two
pairs of Amazons and two pairs of Grey Parrots, making it a very satis-
factory season. There appear to have been only two things different from
in previous years; firstly a very hot dry summer which does not seem to
have favoured parakeet breeding up and down the country, and secondly
my introduction of natural logs as nest-boxes, standing on concrete
slabs and raised well above the ground. As concrete does retain moisture
has this helped to keep the interiors at the right humidity to help with
the hatching? I he cockatoos have had a choice of various nest-boxes,
but all have chosen the natural logs.
f ;
As described, Mr. C. Smith has bred the Lesser Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea sulphured. It is believed this may be a
first success. Any member or reader knowing of a precious breeding of
this species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretarv.

part of an exchange agreement in 1966. Some difficulty was experienced
in determining the sexes of the birds, but an attempt was made to divide
them into three pairs. This was successful in at least one case, since one
pair kept in a large planted pheasant aviary built a nest and laid eggs,
which proved to. be infertile, in 1968. The second pair built a nest but
no eggs were laid. What was believed to be a male of the third pair
escaped at Easter of that year and has remained at liberty in the Park ever
since. It seems to have a comparatively small territory and during the
winter it is often seen feeding from the wild boars feeding-trough in
their enclosure not far away and it has also been observed to feed its mate
with grubs through the wire-netting of the aviary. Various attempts have
been made to re-capture this bird but so far none has proved successful,
as it is not only intelligent, but extremely suspicious of any form of trap.
In 1969 both pairs nested again, the same pair producing eggs which
once again proved to be infertile. I he second pair did not la^.
Early in 1970 it was decided to split the birds and the hen which had
laid was mated with the larger of the two birds in the other pair. T his
re-shuffle was successful in that the pair built a nest amongst the fir
boughs attached to a support post 7 ft. above the ground in the aviary.
The nest contained four eggs on 24th May and they hatched on 8th June.
The four young fledged and were seen flying around the aviary on 2nd
July. Unfortunately one was subsequently killed by a weasel, but the
remaining three have survived and are now quite independent of their
parents.
These birds are normally fed a mixture of pheasant starter crumbs and
insectivorous food with a liberal supply of maggots and mealworms.
When rearing young they appeared to feed them exclusively on mealworms
which were sprinkled daily with Casilan (Glaxo) to supply additional
protein.

(Trichoglossus ornatus)
By John Bunker (Ettington, Warwickshire, England)
In July 1969 I obtained a pair of Ornate Lorikeets which had been
imported some twelve months previously, the birds were very active
although one of them had only stumps of flight feathers in one wing and,
as they were in an aviary and were very wild, this bird had damaged the
extremity of the clipped wing through heavy landings. The plumage of
both birds was not in the best condition, but they looked a pair and so
they found their way into my collection.
They were released in a flight 8 ft. x 2 ft. x 6 ft. where they spent the
summer and autumn. A parrakeet-type nest-box was installed and the
birds took immediate possession, the hen roosting inside the box with the
cock at the entrance hole; however, nothing of any note happened except
that, with the assistance of a varied diet and constant bathing facilities,
the birds' plumage improved tremendously and by October both birds
were in splendid condition and could fly normally.
At the end of November they were transferred to winter quarters and
were housed in an all-wire flight-cage 4 ft. long x 2 ft. wide x 3 ft. high.
In bebruary of this year a nest-box was placed on the floor of the cage
with a view to getting the birds accustomed to it prior to their transference
to an outdoor aviary, its dimensions were 15 in. high x 9 in. x 9 in. with
a in. diameter entrance hole and a perch. The base was covered to a
depth of 3 in. with a mixture of peat, soil and wood chippings, dampened
and rammed down tightly. The box was investigated almost immediately
and from then on both birds roosted in it.
Some three weeks later the birds were seen mating and the cock was
feeding the hen regularly, the box was examined about a week later, but
the only sign of any nesting activity was a minor excavation in one corner.
During the third week of April the hen was conspicuous by her absence
and as soon as anyone approached the cage the cock dived into the box.
This was examined much to the birds' consternation and was found to
contain two white eggs, roughly the size and shape of those of the Eastern
Rosella. They had assumed the chalky-white appearance of fertile eggs
and hopes were hign for a successful hatching. As the atmosphere was
very dry the floor of the cage was moistened daily.
The hen was observed out of the box more regularly during early May,
but as the birds were still highly nervous and suspicious of any interference
in their domestic routine the box was not examined again until young
were heard clamouring for food. Upon examining the box on the 28th
May two young were found and were estimated to be about two weeks old,
at this stage thev had only a sparse covering of white down. They were

not examined closely but, perhaps surprisingly, the nest-box was quite
drv and sweet and still contained the egg shells.
Increasing amounts of food were being consumed, the staple diet being
a mixture of sugar, Farlene, Complan, honey, condensed milk, Bovnl and
Abidec, this being diluted with boiling water. It was supplemented with
sweet apple, ripe banana, stale sponge cake green ears of wheat and
gentles, all of these were taken with equal avidity. The birds had
continued through this period to make full use of the bathing facilities,
sometimes bathing several times daily. Both birds spent long periods
in the nest-box and both took all of the above-mentioned foods. The
cock was not seen to feed the hen after the young had hatched
The box was subsequently examined on the 6th June when the young
were seen to have grown considerably and were clothed in dense white
down On the 14th June they were still down-covered but pin feathers
were &apos;very noticeable on their heads and backs. The young clamoured
regularly for food at this period, even late at night, and the parents were
naturally consuming large quantities of food
The young were again examined on the 26th June and their grow w- s
very noticeable, their plumage had also developed considerably. Due to
my being absent from the 27th June to the 10th July the young were
not examined again until the latter date when they were found to be fu y
feathered, with tails as long as those of the adults and with only minimal
vestiges of down. ,,11.
The only really noticeable difference between the young and the adult
birds was that the plumage of the young was slightly duller, 1 eir lrlse *
were black instead of the orange of the adults, and their bills were almost
black as against the orange-yellow bills of their parents. I was quite
surprised to find the young still in the nest-box at this late date.
The elder of the young left the box for the first time on the 18th July
being followed by the younger on the 21st July. Even after t ey a
left the box both the young and the adults spent a lot of time in 1 an
would retreat to it with the minimal provocation.
The young were seen to be feeding themselves on the 30th July, an
were independent of the parents by the 2nd August.
As described above, Mr. John Bunker has bred the Ornate Lorikeet
(Trichoglossus ornatus). It is believed this may be a first success.

I have bred the Fawn-naped Tanager, Taugara ruficervix leucotis, this
summer, and the young birds are now moulting into adult plumage.
These birds, which were imported from Equador last year, are mainly
blue in colour with a fawn patch at the back of the head. They are
roughly the size of a sparrow.
As usual with Tanagers, they became extremely belligerent when
pairing, and as there is no sexual difference in colour it is very difficult
to see which bird is paired to which, and the first definite sign that one
usually has, unless you happen to be there at the crucial moment, is a
badly battered bird if there are more than a pair of the same tanager in
the aviary. This fighting does not seem to extend much beyond their
own variety, but should a battle take place it is short and deadly. The
trouble is that Tanagers are so quick in their movements. Out of the
breeding season they are reasonably peaceful.
The nest, built in an angle of a wood frame was about the flimsiest I
have known, and the usual Tanager clutch--two eggs--was laid. Like
most birds that have had little contact with man in the wild, they are
fearless sitters, but as the weather was warm at the time the hen left the
nest for so long that I was very surprised that the eggs hatched. I
cannot give much information on length of incubation, but it was about
14 days. The young were in the nest for nearly three weeks.
I have always been interested to try to find out if these small tanagers
feed by regurgitation or not, and I feel reasonably sure that these birds
did so in part. Certainly such flies as were caught were fed whole, but I
think that some food was fed by regurgitation--fruit and sucked-out
mealworms.
The plumage of the young birds was dull blue, dark on the head, lighter
on the back, with a greyish-blue breast. No trace of the fawn nape was
apparent.
As described above Mr. H. Murray has bred the Fawn-naped Tanager
{Tang (ii cl 1 uficervix leucotis ). It is believed this may be a first success.

Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with

Two hundred and eighty-four birds of 41 species have been bred in
the Park this season. Apart from the commoner European forms,
waterfowl bred include 17 Emperor, seven Red-breasted, four Ashy-
headed, four Ruddy-headed and six Cereopsis Geese. Ducks include
seven Baikal Teal, seven Canvasback and five European Eider reared.
The Baikal Teal were hatched from eggs laid by a pair bred in the Park
in 1966. They are kept on the largest pool which has an area of more than
three-quarters of an acre of water.
The following is a list of birds, other than waterfowl, bred and surviving
to independence.

The five young Kestrels were produced by the pair which reared one
youngster last year. .
The Stone Curlews, all of which are pinioned and kept in the wader
pool produced no less than 11 eggs. Of these, four proved to be infertile,
two contained dead-in-shell chicks, and five hatched. One youngster
died from an unhealed navel and the remaining four were successfully
reared
It is not possible to leave the eggs under the parent Stone Curlews since
they are nearly always stolen by Jackdaws, lhe procedure has been to
remove the eggs after they have been incubated for seven or eight days
and hatch them under broody bantams. Immediately after hatching the
young chicks are placed without the bantam in an electrically-heated coop
and for the first two or three days they are force-fed with maggots and
meal worms every two hours. After this period they learn to pick up
food for themselves, though they will still take it from the hand whenever
it is offered to them. , _ , ,
The nine young Eagle Owls brings the total to be bred in the Park to

presented to the German Conservation Authorities who are responsible
for a similar reintroduction project in the Eifel area of Germany.
The one Snowy Owl to be bred was the sole survivor of four chicks
hatched by a female Eagle Owl. This bird has no mate but is a prolific
egg-producer and since our female Snowy Owl refuses to rear her own
chicks, it was decided to substitute the Eagle Owl's eggs with those of the
1 Snowy Owl. The Eagle Owl is a much earlier breeder, but by removing
j her eggs this particular bird was induced to go on laying until she produced
a clutch at the same time as the Snowy Owl. Two of the four chicks
survived for more than a fortnight, then the smaller was discovered
v headless, and as a safety measure the remaining chick was removed and
- reared by hand. It is now fully fledged and very tame.
Both the Alpine Chough and the Azure-winged Magpie may be the
 |firs* of their species bred in captivity in Britain, and separate accounts of
their breeding occur elsewhere.

bourcierii , raised my hopes and may yet add to my " firsts " this season.
Last year they drilled a perfect nesting hole in a rotten tree-stump and
the hen became rather ' puffy ' and obviously on the point of laying.
Then they suddenly deserted the tree-stump and I found that mice had
j taken over. Later they returned to the nesting-hole and worked on it
with such enthusiasm that they went straight through the bottom, having
excavated to a depth of over two feet. Incidentally they did not leave a
single wood-chip in the vicinity of the stump. They took it in turns to
excavate, each working for between five to ten minutes and then emerging
j with a beak and throat full of chips which they carried to the far end of
the house and there dumped it from a high perch.
This spring I supplied them with a partly rotten tree-trunk about eight
[ inches in diameter and four feet high, which I stood upright in the centre
of a small pool where I hope mice will not reach it. Recently they have
taken to this new stump and starting at a point where a branch had
broken off, drilled inwards and then downwards in the exact centre.
They have worked on this continuously for nearly a week (it is still hard
&apos; wood in the centre) and have reached a depth of about eighteen inches;
at which depth they have enlarged the shaft, which is little more than an
inch in diameter, into a circular chamber about three inches in diameter.
The hen again looks to be on the point of laying and the cock is constantly
fussing round her and feeding her with mealworms and apple; " tuk,
j -uk, tuk ", tuking to her just like a bantam hen calling chicks to food
she has found for them. I am keeping my fingers crossed,

Black-spotted Barbets, Capita niger , also gave promising signs. They
have a partly hollow tree-trunk which they have used as a roosting place
for the past two years and this summer the cock became very attentive
until the hen was obviously about to lay, which she eventually did from
a Derch ^ ^
A pair of Orange-headed Ground Thrushes, Geokichla citrina , which
reared three nice youngsters, two cocks and a hen, last year, have hatched
five successive nests of three each this season but went to nest so soon
after rearing the first three that the second and third rounds were hatched
before the first were independent. I am certain that the oldest youngsters
were responsible for picking their younger brothers and sisters out of the
nest when they were still quite small, and while the hen had left the nest
to feed, for I found them scattered about the aviary one by one, all very
dead. The same nest was used for each brood and by the time that the
fourth clutch was laid had become very delapidated, tipped partly on
its side and so much flattened that it was little more than a platform with
a slight depression in the centre. The fourth set of chicks were reared
until they began to move about in the nest, whereupon one after another
went overboard. I then tried to prop up the nest with a wad of grass
pushed under it, but I could not remould it or make the depression any
deeper. The hen actually laid the first egg of her fifth clutch whilst I
was collecting more material for tempoiary repairs; so I had to leave the
job unfinished. However, what work I had managed to do seemed to be
effective, and the fifth brood were progressing well and had reached the
stage where they could stand on the edge of the nest and I really thought
they would be fully reared. Came a heavy rain-storm during the night
and the nest finally collapsed, I found three miserable and saturated little
corpses on the ground next morning.
As if the old birds had deliberately held back their moult and could
now wait no longer, they literally fell to bits--to such an extent that for
some time they were completely unable to fly, having dropped all their
primaries at once. They are recovering equally fast, but it is sad to think
of so much wasted effort--only three reared out of a possible fifteen.
Incidentally this pair have been in my possession since 1965 and I had never
heard the cock sing until this spring, when he had competition from the
two young cocks reared last year, which were in a nearby aviary. During
the early spring the chorus of these three birds was so magnificent that I

My young Rufous-bellied Bulbul, Hypsipetes mcclellandii , is
now assuming full adult plumage and although he takes his fill at the food
table each morning he is still ready to accept the odd tit-bit offered by the
parents occasionally. These birds also laid a second clutch very soon
after the first youngster left the nest, and incubated long beyond the
normal period of fourteen days, but the eggs were infertile. During the

whole of this long period the first-nest youngster was allowed to sit on the
edge of the nest, the old cock bringing food to it and the sitting hen at
the same time. The results of the 1970 breedings are not very impressive,
but it has its points of interest--and there is still the possibility that the
barbets may lay. They are in my small tropical house, so they will not
suffer from the deteriorating weather conditions at this late time of year.

The Committee of the Avicultural Society of South Australia has
compiled a Bird Price List. The prices quoted are to be regarded as a
guide only and refer to true, adult pairs, aviary-bred and of good quality.
Amongst the parrots listed are Crimson-winged at (roughly) #8 15s. od.
Rock Pebblers, #6 05. od., and Kings, #8 05. od. Export and import
prohibitions taken into consideration, the #500 recently asked in England
for a pair of the last named would seem to offer a great temptation for the
breaking of such.

David Spilsbury says of the 1970 Census for Rothschild's Mynah:
All owners known to keep this species have been sent a census form and
it is hoped that these will be returned promptly. The recent influx of
wild-caught specimens through the trade will have resulted in some new
owners and I would be glad if these aviculturists would contact me at
Withersfield, 5 Lambourne Avenue, Malvern Link, Worcs.
The census form this year seeks information on the feeding of breeding
and non-breeding stock, the sexing for the species and causes of death.
Also we seek to find out how many have been exported from Bali and,
of course, maintain our interest in the breeding of this fine mynah ".

Gerald Durrell, Hon. Director, Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust:
I his year we have bred 11 more White Eared Pheasants (which are still
too young to sex) from the original pair: and the six pairs from last year
continue to flourish. They laid a number of eggs this year but, naturally,
all of them were infertile, but we hope next year to have a sort of Ford
production belt in operation.
We were nearly successful in breeding the Thick-billed Parrots I
brought back from the Mexican expedition two years ago. Unfortunately,
one young one was crushed by its parents at the age of ten days, and the
other one died shortly afterwards. We have not yet received a post-
mortem report on it, but since our three pairs of birds are rather young
specimens, it was rather surprising that they bred at all."

<bodyText confidence="0.989402764705882" page_id="58076370"  page_num="252" year="" vol="">
When editing an article in the July-August number of the Magazine by
Miss Rosemary Low I found that the name " Massena's Parrot " was not
used in books on South American birds, and therefore inserted the addi-
tional name " White-capped Parrot ", which is the name given to Pionus
seneloides by de Schauensee in his several recent books on the birds of the
South Aunerican region, and is the name by which it is now likely to be
recognised. Miss Low has since pointed out that the name White-
capped Parrot " is also used for P. senilis , and is more appropriate for the
latter species since it does have a white crown and forehead. This does
not, however, alter the fact that P. seneloides has also been given this name
and has appeared, and is likely to appear, as the White-capped Parrot in
books and articles on South American birds. Once such names are used
in standard regional avifaunas it is extremely difficult to change them;
and we can probably only remain aware that in present day writings on
birds we may encounter both a Central American White-capped Parrot,
P. senilis , and a South American White-capped Parrot, P. seniloides.

(Lanius excubitor)
By Derrick England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
I imported my pair of Great Grey Shrikes from India at the beginning
&amp;gt;f 1969. On arrival they were placed in separate cages--approximately
5 ft. x 1 ft. x 1 ft. 8 in.--to settle down and to learn to eat substitute foods.
The room was controlled at 6o*F, later reduced to 5o*F. Although
he birds differed slightly in plumage--one had faint traces of brown among
he breast and flank feathers--I was not over-optimistic about their being
1 pair since the brown one might have been in immature plumage, as
ndeed it turned out to be, because within a few months the two were
ndistinguishable so far as colouration was concerned.
One was steady and ate well; the other--in immature plumage--was
tesperately wild while in a cage and was a difficult feeder. They were
tarted on mealworms, maggots and small pieces of ox-heart. When
hey were taking the heart well, it was rolled in a mixture of soft-food,
donate, baby-food, powdered egg-yolk and yeast. They were not fond
f the last three and these were discontinued, although the yeast has
ecently been acceptably re-introduced. From early April through the
breeding season finely powdered cuttle was added. Surprisingly, they
oth seem quite unable to assimilate maggots, bringing them up shortly
fter swallowing in a large undigested mass. Also surprisingly, although
i 11 my other soft-bills from nuthatches to rollers prefer locusts in various
 |zes to almost all other food, these Great Grey Shrikes were until recently
ot enthusiastic and would only take adults, even these being allowed to
m around their aviary unless the shrikes were really hungry; the only
I ire way of getting them to eat them was to impale them on their favourite
10m. They have, however, recently acquired a taste for them. Live
narrows were ignored when released into the aviary as food, although
heat Grey Shrikes reputedly include many birds in their diet. (Witherby
d. 1938). I was interested to note that some items of food, for
cample full-grown locusts, are frequently carried considerable distances
t one foot as is the habit of most large birds of prey. This is especially
) in the case of the oldest surviving youngster, which is a particularly
rong, active bird.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995807666666667" page_id="58076402"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
In April, with much misgiving because of their murderous reputation,
they were put out together in an aviary 45 ft. long x 4 ft. wide and 8 ft.
high, with heated shelter approximately 5 ft. x 3 ft. x 8 ft. high. Initially
the thermostat was set at 5o*F, but throughout the quite cold winter of
1 969/70 ^ was set to do no more than prevent actual freezing. I have
no doubt at all from this and other evidence that, difficult though they
may be to keep in health from some other points of view, they are hardy
in the extreme as far as cold is concerned.
The expected fighting did not materialize, although they immediately
divided the long narrow aviary into two territories, the bird which subse-
quently proved to be a female occupying the part remote from the shelter.
She therefore has to pass through the male's territory to reach the food,
with the result that I suspect that he usually gets the tit-bits. Although
he has never been seen to attack her when in his territory, she obviously
goes in some fear of him out of the breeding season and this part of her
approach to the shelter is achieved in a hasty dash. The shelter itself
seems to be regarded as neutral ground. This holding of territory was
not entirely abandoned during nesting (the only nesting site was in the
female's section), the birds continuing to use their chosen individual
perches, though this may have been mainly a matter of habit.
Shortly after being put out of doors one bird was seen carrying nesting
material. An " artificial bush " was put high up in one cover, consisting
of suitably forked branches surrounded by screening evergreens, and a
very good deep nest was immediately built of twigs and dried grasses,
lined with finer grasses, feathers, small pieces of paper and glass wool, the
material used for roof insulation. I supplied this as a substitute for the
wool often used in the wild, as being less likely to become tangled round
the birds' toes and because the weather was very cold. No courtship
was seen and, although the female continually begged for food and solicited
copulation, the other bird appeared to take no interest whatsoever. He
must, however, have had something to do with things since four of the
five eggs were fertile. Later he once or twice unbent so far as to feed the
female when she left the nest. Subsequent experience with these and
Rufous-backed Shrikes gives me the impression that sexual activity, both
in and out of the breeding season, is most often initiated by the female.
I did my best to leave well alone and so did not at first know the number
of eggs in the nest, although it was fairly obvious when incubation, even
if only intermittent, began, since the female had by now lost most of her
nervousness and would allow one to watch her on the nest from a short
distance away. The male's apparent lack of interest had not led me to
expect much and I was therefore not altogether surprised when there
were still eggs on the seventeenth day. (Incubation period 15 days--
Witherby, H. F., et al. 1938.) Expectations had in fact been lowered still
further by the female staying off the nest for long periods during the first
few days of incubation. (Experience with these and other shrikes has

since shown that this is normal--if rather alarming--behaviour, because
this year five nests of two different species have appeared to be deserted
soon after incubation began, but have hatched satisfactorily.) However,
 |on the eighteenth day the male was seen to carry food to the female on
the nest and she in turn to pass it to something beneath her.
All seemed to go well for about four days*, after which the dreaded
corpses began to be delivered to a spot just inside the aviary door. (It is
interesting how many birds in captivity not only place empty egg-shells
in a chosen spot but also use it as a last resting-place for the bodies of their
, offspring.)
Dr. Ian Keymer happened to be staying with us at the time and so an
expert post-mortem examination was possible immediately. Each
contained an impacted mass of the cases of blowfly pupae. It is one of
the shrikes' less-endearing habits that, unless absolutely desperate efforts
are made to prevent it, they will persist in feeding their young on one
item of food only--usually the least suitable--however many alternatives
are provided. So four nice youngsters perished, together with my hopes.
Several inactive weeks went by and then they began again. The old
jf nest was relined, eggs were laid and incubated. They were fertile but
did not hatch--she probably carried the business of " temporary
desertion " in the early stages too far, in very mixed weather.
During the winter they had to be driven into the shelter each night_
my wife valiantly carrying on this rather exacting exercise when I was
absent--until it was discovered that they do not normally go to roost until
it is nearly dark: when left alone they always put themselves to bed long
after we have abandoned hope and in fact after we could see properly.
We had a lot of snow and frosts in Norfolk last winter and so I was not
 |prepared for nest-building to commence on 5th January. I felt that it
really was asking for disaster to allow them to continue at that time of year
and so took down the nest-site and re-erected it in the shelter, where it
was ignored. From then on, every time there was the slightest hint of
spring in the weather, the birds made desperate attempts to build a nest
in the spot in the air where the bush had been. This year the male was
 |taking a bigger share, even if only by encouraging his mate, and the
efforts of the two to beat impossible circumstances were quite heart-
rending. Week after week I was tempted to give way against my better
judgement, but I hardened my heart until 16th March, when the male was
seen feeding his mate, and I erected an improved version of the previous
year's bush in the same spot. But frustration had killed desire--I had
put them off too long. Nothing at all happened until 22nd March, when
a nest was very hastily built in which six eggs were laid.
This of course was the signal for the weather to turn really nasty, and
on several nights--and even days--during incubation their water was
frozen. Apart from the early exasperating " messing about ", the female
sat solidly through some really shocking weather, to hatch two of her six

eggs on the nineteenth day, and two more on the twentieth. Even
allowing for the very cold weather, this period--and my previous
experience in captivity of 18 days--appear to make it desirable to recon-
sider the 16 days quoted by the Handbook. The incubating female
habitually left the nest each evening at dusk for food and for an ex-
tensive preen, sometimes for as long as half an hour.
I have had a fair amount of experience of the breeding of this species
in Norway, Spain and Portugal, and am familiar with its wary and
secretive approach to a nest containing young, but never have I known
a pair of birds to rear young while hardly appearing to feed them at all, as
these did. Nor have I known birds which were more trying in their
refusal to feed their young on a suitably varied diet.
I have previously recorded the fact (England, 1970) that in 1969 a pair
of Rufous-backed Shrikes Lanins schach , by feeding only mealworms,
nearly brought complete disaster to their young in the nest. The Great
Greys in 1970 did their utmost to repeat this performance with their
successive broods and only an almost round-the-clock vigilance in order
to proffer alternative food at appropriate moments prevented them from
doing so. Small locusts--one of the most suitable and natural foods--
they ignored for the first two broods, adult ones being rather reluctantly
accepted if we impaled them on one of their two favourite thorns in the
aviary. Ox heart was similarly left alone, as were maggots. (In view
of previous experience blowfly pupae were withdrawn.)
Fortunately we had managed to coincide the birth of two litters of ten
and twelve white mice with the hatch of the young shrikes, and I have
little doubt that they were largely responsible for the small measure of
eventual success. One at a time they were placed alive in a food dish,
and the male seized and impaled them and he and his mate tore off small
pieces of flesh to take to the nest. The heads he usually swallowed whole
himself. This worked well while the young mice were pink, but when
they began to grow white hair the birds would not take them, and only
half-heartedly did so when we impaled them. Apart from these, the only
food seen to be taken to the nest was mealworms. These were given
rolled in a mixture of Vionate and finely-powdered cuttle, sometimes with
baby-food added. Most of the food was taken to the nest by the male
for the first seven days, then by the female as well, while from nine days
onwards the male did little but keep guard. The female preferred to
take food to the young from the ground or from one of two favourite
spikes on which the male had impaled it. Although she frequently took
food from the spikes she seldom impaled it herself, but she was seen to do
so occasionally, thus confirming my note (England, 1969) correcting what
had been previously written on this point (Beven and England, 1969).
On leaving the nest she would go immediately to one of these spikes to
see whether food was there, leaving one in little doubt that it is usual for
the male to " keep the larder stocked ". (Remains on these spikes

showed that he found some food for himself in the aviary--a small vole,
a frog and a bumble-bee.) Both sexes were very bold in defence of
either eggs or young in the nest, not hesitating actually to attack us when
we went near the nest, sometimes quite painfully.
Two of the young survived to fledging, and at this stage one of them
was taken for hand-finishing " in order to ensure that at least one
survived. However, the remaining one also survived and must of course
have been fed by the parents, although they were rarely seen to do this.
He sat about on various perches in the aviary, sometimes on the floor, and
eventually had to be removed because he adopted as a roosting place the
foundations of the new nest which his mother was by then building a foot
above the previous one.
It is interesting that the vocabulary of this young bird which was
reared by the parents was quite dissimilar from that of the one reared by
us, even though the latter had been with the parents until after fledging.
The former made only one noise--a monosyllabic " quirk " which served
as a location call and discontinued this within a short time.
Unlike most other species of shrike, the fledglings' plumage is very
similar to that of the adults, the main differences being that the black is
less intense, the grey is more silvery, there is some brown on the
" shoulders " and secondaries and the white of the breast and flanks has
faint brown markings. At five months old adult plumage had been
assumed.
So much for the first brood in 197** Two young were successfully
reared, one by the parents and one partly by us.
The greater part of the incubation and rearing of the second brood
took place while I w 7 as away in Spain. We are very fortunate in having an
enthusiastic and helpful neighbour wTo, although he had no previous
experience with softbills, was prepared to tackle our somewhat exacting
ones and in fact does so most conscientiously and remarkably well. My
wife returned from Spain, some time before me, to find a further brood
of five well-feathered young Great Grey Shrikes almost ready to leave
the nest. Once again the parents appeared to feed them remarkably
seldom and she quite rightly removed one youngster for hand-rearing.
However, although perfect in every other respect and beautifully feathered
and alert, its legs were deformed. To cut a miserable story short, all five
were imperfect, having deformed legs (in three the legs were actually
broken while still in the nest) and some degree of polyneuritis. Despite
this, she succeeded in keeping them alive until I returned, although
unfortunately to no purpose. Three were taken to Dr. Ian Keymer for
post-mortem examination.
Within a few 7 days this remarkable female was re-lining the second nest
and by 24th June she was incubating her third clutch of eggs--this time
only three, but since the male was by now in a heavy moult there seemed
little chance of them being fertile. A more than usually careful watch

was kept on her now-familiar intermittent periods on the nest in an attempt
to discover exactly how long the incubation period was. It was easy to
determine when hatching took place because she always carried the empty
e gg_ s hells into the shelter (the previous years she had deposited them in a
corner of the flight) but it is extremely difficult to be sure when " serious "
incubation begins because of her sporadic sitting during, and for the first
few days after, egg-laying. It is not possible to be more precise than to
say that on this occasion incubation took not less than 20 days and possibly
as long as 22.
The bedraggled male did not feed the female on the nest and took no
part whatever in feeding the young. In fact he hindered their develop-
ment by eating all the choicest items of food, Since incubating female
shrikes are usually very dependent on their mates for food there was no
great hope of rearing this third brood. The female " did good by
stealth " even more unobtrusively than usual, and by the ninth day was
sitting listlessly most of the time on a perch near the male. However,
she continued to brood on the nest at night and for short periods during
the day showing that something in it was alive. On the eleventh day,
26th July, the nest seemed quite deserted so it was decided to investigate.
Both parents became wildly alarmed at my approach and I was amazed
when, as I reached up to the nest, a lively youngster left it. At least one
more was alive in the nest. Since it was raining heavily and the youngster
which had flown was obviously too advanced to remain in the nest if
replaced, it was taken to my wife, who once more became a successful
foster parent. It was subsequently found that there was one more chick
and an infertile egg in the nest. One of the parents--almost certainly
the female--eventually removed the chick, which was greatly retarded
and had a deformed upper mandible, and impaled it on a thorn and ate
part of it! The lively one is now seven months old and the female spends
much of her time showing that she is anxious to start a fourth nest, by
begging for food and soliciting the attentions of the unmoved male. This
is especially noteworthy because the first brood was successful; shrikes
are considered to be usually single-brooded except that they will replace
lost eggs or young, sometimes several times.
The voung commenced to sing when quite young; one--thought at that
time to be a female because it was carrying nesting material at five months
old--was singing strongly at 11 weeks. The "song ' is remarkably like the
chattering warble of a Budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus , interspersed
with raucous notes which are used by the parents as alarm calls, and some-
times continues almost unbroken for long periods. When first put into an
aviary by themselves one of the youngsters begged for food from a Rufous-
backed Shrike in the next compartment every time that bird approached
the dividing wire. One is tempted to wonder whether the broad dark
eye-stripe common to both species was what made the young bird think
its parent was near.

Both the above species of shrikes relish wasps and seem quite immune
to the sting, since they unhesitatingly swallow them whole. But also--
indeed clamator and vittatus as well--suffer much from " sore feet " in
captivity, probably further evidence of a dietary deficiency. No actual
lesions have ever been seen and one would be inclined to ascribe the
trouble to cramp were it not for the immediate withdrawal when the
affected foot touches a perch. Neither parents nor young have ever been
seen to bathe nor even to drink.
Summary and Discussion
In 19^9 and 197* Great Grey Shrikes Lanius excubitor, bred in an
aviary at Neatishead, Norfolk. Nest-building was by the female, some-
times encouraged and accompanied by the male.
In 1970 fourteen eggs were laid in clutches of six, five and three, of
which eleven hatched (four, five and two). The four in the first nest
were physically perfect and two were reared, one by the parents and one
with hand-feeding assistance. Five in the second nest were reared to
fledging, though none survived to maturity. Of the two eggs which
hatched in the third nest, one produced a perfect youngster which was
successfully reared, the other a deformed one which died or was killed by
the parents. Thus six of eleven chicks were deformed or diseased, and
the result of all this effort by the parent birds--and incidentally by my
wife--was only three reared to healthy independence. It is not, of course,
known whether the defects arose solely as a result of deficiency in the food
received by the young after hatching or was inherent in the embryo,
perhaps because the female was deprived of some essential food.
The advice of a number of experts was sought during this frustrating
period but it has to be admitted that, although some most interesting
suggestions were made, no satisfactory solution has been found to the
problem presented by three successive broods from the same parents
producing the paradox of (ignoring infertile eggs) 100% healthy, 100%
abnormal, and 50% healthy/5o% abnormal young respectively. The food
given to the parents--and by them to the young--was consistent throughout,
with one small exception: on the suggestion of Dr. Ian Keymer the meal-
worms given to the third brood were fed on white bread rather than bran
to increase the chance of calcium being available. This brood also
possibly had more small locusts because the parents had started taking
them in greater quantity.
An intriguing theory advanced by two dietary experts was that success
was related to temperature. The three broods were in the nest during very
cold, very hot and moderate weather respectively and there might appear
to be a superficial relationship. It is said that calcium metabolism is
interfered with in hot conditions, and there seems little doubt that one
of the principal troubles of the second--100% afflicted--brood was a

failure to assimilate and utilise calcium. However, this theory seems
untenable in the light of the fact that this particular pair of shrikes came
from India where the temperature during the breeding season is almost
certainly higher than even the hottest days of an English summer. (It
must be admitted that it is just possible that they were only winter visitors
to India, having migrated from their breeding quarters further north,
in which case their calcium metabolism might be adapted to lower
temperatures in the breeding season.)
Vitamin or mineral deficiency are obvious possible culprits, especially
in the context of previous experience with shrikes of other species.
However, all mealworms supplied were liberally sprinkled with Vionate
powder and if anything vitamin overdose seems more likely than deficiency,
though this idea is not really tenable because on a previous occasion a
grossly afflicted Rufous-backed Shrike Lanius schach recovered almost
completely when given large quantities of Vionate (England, 1970).
Apart from the calcium available in the food, finely powdered cuttle was
also sprinkled on the mealworms, except for the second brood when I
was absent.
It is apparent that there is much to be learnt about the keeping of
shrikes in captivity and especially about the rearing of healthy young.
I have had five species --Lanius excubitor, L. Schach , L. vittatus , L. collurio
and L. clamator , the first three of which have produced young. Hand-
rearing wild youngsters which have had a satisfactory diet since hatching,
(or whose parents have had such a diet), is comparatively easy and our
only failure in this respect was thirty years ago with a family of young
Red-backed Shrikes, which had rickets because we then knew even less
about suitable food for them than we do now.
Shrikes are unusual in that, when breeding in captivity, they do not fail
to rear their young for the same reasons as other softbills. Many species 1
either desert their young on hatching, or throw them out of the nest, or
brood them but refuse to feed them (apparently because the food offered
is unsuitable), or desert them because of a too-urgent desire to start a new
nest. Not infrequently the male is an obvious murderer. Olive-backed
Thrushes will only feed their young on food scattered on the ground and
will not do so from dishes, though they still eat from these themselves
(Everett, 1959 and personal experience). Shrikes, on the other hand,
cannot be accused of not trying. Their failure, when it occurs, is almost
certainly the result of our ignorance and not because they have the bad
habits of so many other species.

BREEDING OF A HYBRID OF THE INDIAN
ZOSTEROPS AND JAPANESE ZOSTEROPS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951925545454545" page_id="58076411"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">

il
Earlv in 197* I purchased two Zosterops of different species from a
gentleman who was selling-up. He did not know the sexes of the birds,
which differed in colour. I knew one to be an Indian Zosterops, Zosterops
palpebrosa, but the other was unknown and I subsequently identified it as a
Japanese Zosterops, Z. japonica, which occurs from Japan to Thailand
and the Philippines. The latter lacked any yellow on breast and belly
and was darker green above.
When I received them I placed them in a large planted aviary some
20 ft. square.
This aviary was also occupied by some 60 small seed-eaters, various
Waxbills, Twinspots, Manakins, Black-eared Finch-larks, Quail, Pytilia's,
etc.
Within a month of having these birds, they built a nest made of hair,
string, grasses, etc., in a dark green privet bush. Two eggs were laid
and incubated for eight days. Both these eggs then disappeared and
were never found. A fortnight then went by and they again laid two
eggs in the nest. These were sat upon for nine days then to my dismay
both the eggs and the nest disappeared completely. I should like to add
that both Zosterops took their turns in sitting on the eggs. I did wonder
whether I had two hens.

However, on the Sunday, July 12th, I had visitors in the afternoon and
being a nice sunny day we all sat in the garden looking at the birds. Both
Zosterops started to carry nesting material in their beaks and started to
build another nest; this was almost complete that evening, and it was, in
fact, finished by Monday mid-day. The birds again started to sit, and on
looking in Monday evening I discovered the first egg, pale-blueish in
colour. On discovering this I was again very pleased but was worried a little
by the other inmates flying about, as they did in fact go into this bush,
also at this time it started to drizzle with rain. As the nest made was this
time a very flimsily-built affair I decided to put a sheet of plastic over the
branches which held the nest. I held this in place with elastic bands.
This would keep the rain off but would the birds take to being shut in
like this? I had noticed that the Zosterops had a habit of always going
to the bottom branches of the bushes and climbing from them to the top
ones, and then sitting in the nest. However, within the hour both birds
came back to the bush and being very inquisitive birds they did to my
relief climb up to the nest and take possession again.
As the days went by I did notice the other birds in the aviary kept well
clear of the bush. I think the plastic sheet, approximately 2 ft. square,
frightened them from it.
However, on the 27th July I noticed both birds coming off the nest in
turn and taking small flies back to the nest. I went into the aviary and
looked inside the nest to discover one chick. I then left the aviary. As
the days went by the parents were very busy feeding maggots, flies, etc. to
the chick
The parents both took it in turns to sit on the chick and as the days went
by, the parent birds gradually were showing more of themselves above the
top of the nest and therefore I knew the chick was getting bigger every
day.
On the 7th August the chick left the nest and the parents made a great
fuss, chasing all other inmates away from it.
The chick was, when fully feathered, a light version of the colouring of
the parent, minus the white eye rings.

BREEDING MRS. WILSON'S TANAGERS AND
PURPLE-THROATED EUPHONIAS

By Johan Ingels (Destelbergen, Belgium)
Since 1968 I have had a fine pair of Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers Tangara
nigrocincta fanny living in a mixed collection of tanagers, which is housed
in a greenhouse 20 ft. x 10 ft. x 8 ft. high, planted with tropical vegetation.
This greenhouse is connected with an outdoor flight 20 ft. x 20 ft. x 10 ft.
high, densely overgrown with shrubs and small trees. During summer
the birds have access to both parts of the aviary, and during winter they
are confined to the greenhouse, which is heated electrically to about 55*F.
During August 1969, the Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers failed to rear one
young from a clutch of two eggs. The nest was built in an open nest-box,
and made entirely of dried grass, roots and dead leaves. The young bird
was six days old when it died from an intestinal inflammation.
This spring, at the end of April, the Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers were shut
in the outdoor aviary together with a pair of Purple-throated Euphonias
Euphonia chlorotica. The remaining part of the bird collection was kept
in the greenhouse.
On 10th May, they started to make a nest in a large bush of Taxus.
The flimsy nest was built with dried vegetable material by the female
bird, although the male helped her by bringing material to the nesting
; site. Two eggs were laid on 13th and 14th May, the ground colour being
greyish-white with brown-grey spots. The eggs were incubated by the
female bird only, and the male only fed a mealworm to his sitting mate
a few times a day. Normally the female left her eggs about once an hour
for a short feeding. During these takings of food, the male bird always
accompanied her. He kept all the time in touch with his mate by calling,
until she was back on the nest again. The brooding bird was rather shy,
and left the nest at very little provocation.
After an incubation period of 14 days, the eggs hatched on 28th May.
The two young, covered with long dark down, were fed by both parents,
though mainly by the female bird. During the first ten days only live
food such as mealworms, mealworm pupae, ant pupae and a large amount
of insects, caught by the parent birds in the shrubbery, were fed to the
young. Only newly-sloughed (white) mealworms and mealworm pupae,
sometimes moistened with vitamins or terramycin to prevent any internal
inflammation, were supplied at intervals. The parents gathered billfulls
of insectivorous food and passed it to the young while sitting on the rim
of the nest. After feeding, the parents cleaned the nest by swallowing the
youngsters' droppings.
At the age of five days the youngsters' feathers started to grow and
after 10 days the young were about fully feathered and the female did no
longer cover them during night. After 13 days the two young were able

to sit on the rim of the nest, and the next day they left it. At that moment
the first feathers of both fledglings were fully developed, except for their
short tail, and they could fly quite well. They usually sat in the shrubs
and were fed by the parent birds with live food, some fruit, and soaked
bread sweetened with honey; although the male took part only to a small
extent in feeding the young birds. The fledglings were found on sight
by the parents, and once the adult birds were nearby the young faintly
called in plaintive voices to beg for food. A few days after the young birds
left the nest their tails started to grow, and when about four weeks old
they were fully feathered and about the same size as the adult birds. The
fledglings never returned to their nest after leaving it, and they slept at
well-screened sites in the shrubs. Both did well, although they had to
withstand some cold nights (5o*F).
At the age of four weeks the juveniles became independent, eating
mainly fruit, especially bananas, cherries, mealworms and soft food.
Nectar was also appreciated. The juvenile feathering of the young has
a dull dark colour with a green tinge and the brighter parts of the adult
birds are replaced by bluish-green ones.
When the fledglings of the first brood were five days out of the nest I
observed the parent birds mating early in the morning. During the
courtship display both birds were sitting next to each other on the same
perch, and with their head and tail stretched slightly upward they made
deep bows forward, alternating with loud calls emitted in upright position.
After a few minutes mating occurred.
The female bird immediately started to repair the old nest, and on 17th
June I found two eggs in it. Incubation at once started but the female
left the nest at regular times to feed the young from the first brood. Both
eggs were fertile and the chicks hatched on 30th June. The young of
this second brood were fed regularly by both parents, and after a nestling
period of two weeks the young birds left the nest and were independent
about two weeks later. During the rearing of the second brood, no
squabbling occurred between the parent birds and the juveniles of the
first nest. The adult birds also tolerated the presence of the pair ot
Purple-throated Euphonias.
A third mating occured before the young of the second nest were fully
independent, and a clutch of two eggs was laid in the relined nest on
17th and 18th July. After a fortnight (on 1st August), eggshells were
found in the aviary. The two chicks of the third brood were properly
fed until the female bird started to moult on the fifth day after hatching.
She lost interest in feeding the young, and as the male no longer helped
her both youngsters died within two days.
After three clutches which resulted in four young Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers,
I removed the nest to prevent any more nesting attempts. At the time
of writing, the young of both nests are moulting and the brighter adult
markings slowly appear through the juvenile feathering.

i ogether with the pair of Tanagers, I confined a pair of Purple-
throated Euphonias, Euphonia chlorotica, to the outdoor aviary. In i960
these birds had a first clutch of four eggs, which were infertile, and they
failed to rear two young, from a second clutch of three eggs. These
two young died from digestive troubles, after they weakened for lack of
food because nine days after hatching the parent birds gradually stopped
feeding their young.
This year, the pair of Euphonias came into breeding condition early in
May, at the same time as the Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers, and the male bird
paid much attention to the female bird, starting to feed her frequently.
; A few da y s later the maIe was seen frequenting a nest-box with a half-open
front. On 5th A lay he started to carry billfulls of nesting material, such
as dried grass, dead leaves and small pieces of plant roots, into the nest-
box, which was completely filled up after a few days. He never used
feathers or hair although these materials were available. After finishing
the rough construction of the nest he lined the small nest cavity reserved
for the eggs with fine dried hay. The female bird rarely helped her mate
with the nesting activities. During the building of the nest, short wild
rPursuits occurred between the male and the female. Suddenly, and
without apparent reason, the male flew rather excited towards the female,
who fled, persecuted by the male, into the dense undergrowth where
copulation took place.
After mating, the male always flew back to a bare perch, where he
slowly calmed down, with his wings hanging down, showing their white
patches, and his tail pointing down, his tail feathers being spread at
intervals, to show the white patches on the outer feathers, which are
invisible when the tail is folded. On 16th May the nest was readv, and
between 28th May and 1st June, three eggs were laid. These eggs also
bad a greyish-white ground colour with red-brown and grey spots. The
female started incubation immediately, and was sitting very persistently.
She only left the nest for very short feeding periods three or four times a
1 day. But when she was oft&apos; the nest, the male always became excited and
usually inspected the nest content before recovering his calm. During
incubation, the male bird was often seen hanging on the aviary wire
tvhile singing his soft pretty song. On 16th June after a normal breeding
Period of about 15 days I found three young in the nest. From the first
lay the chicks were properly fed with regurgitated food. During the
jirst days after hatching both parents gathered large amounts of food
or their young. First the male would go back to the nest, feeding the
youngsters while hanging at the front of the nest-box, and his visit was al-

maggots and mealworm pupae to the young. The last-born young was
very weak and it disappeared out of the nest within a week after hatching.
When the young were eight and 11 days old, I gave a drop of polyvita-
min mixture and a drop of terramycin directly in the gaping beaks, to
obviate any vitamin deficiency and to prevent any intestinal troubles.
On 30th June, after a fortnight, both young were well-feathered, .and
on 7th July, after a nestling period of 21 days, a first young left the nest;
and two days later the second one followed. Both young were poor fliers,
because their tail and flight feathers were not yet fully developed, and
most of the time they were hidden in the dense vegetation.
After leaving the nest the young never returned to it. The fledglings
were now fed by the male only. The female bird no longer took care of
the young, and on 22nd July I found a new clutch of three eggs in the
relined nest, and two young hatched on 7th August after a breeding period
of 16 days; but as the male bird was still busy feeding the young of the
first brood who were clamouring for food nearly all day, and as the female
had lost interest in rearing her young, both chicks starved.
In the meantime the flight and tail feathers of the young birds slowly
developed and they learned to fly properly. They followed the male bird
through the shrubbery and begged for food with loud chirping calls and
shivering wings.
A month after leaving the nest, the young were self-supporting; taking
mainly bananas, pears, grapes, soaked bread and ant pupae. I assume
that one of the young is a female since it has the same colouring as the
adult female, and the other, a male, has much the same colours except for
a dark tail and black flights. This young male is in immaculate condition
and is moulting now, the yellow colour on the head already appearing
through the juvenile feathering. On sunny days, he is studying the male's
song, hidden in the shrubs, and I have already heard his typical call of a
male Purple-throated Euphonia.
At the time of writing, I have given all the young and the adult birds,
together with the other part of my tanager collection, the run of the out-
door flight and the greenhouse. They all live together amicably although,
sometimes I have seen short quarrels about food or roosting sites between
the young birds and adult tanagers of other species.

The following notes are an attempt to record an interesting nesting
that took place in our aviary during 1969.
A Kirk's hen (Chalcomitra amethystina kirkii) that is one of a trio of
two hens and a cock we received from Portuguese East Africa in 1961, was
put in a 3 ft. cube flight to attempt breeding. This hen however is rather
a bully, and although she agrees perfectly well in a show cage with her
mate, she will knock him about badly in a flight. (The other hen is
frightened to death of the cock.)
However, after again trying several times in 1969 to get them to agree
and being unsuccessful, we transferred her to another flight on the 1st
June 1969. She built a nest, but again would have nothing to do with her
own cock. We soon noticed she was calling to the cock of our mating
pair of Scarlet Chested Sunbirds (C. senegalensis ) in the next flight from
which we bred two youngsters. (See Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 75,
No. 7, 1969.)
He was introduced to her on the 29th June 1969, and she immediately
invited him to copulate, which he did twice. Within the space of ten
minutes however, we had to remove him as she began knocking him about.
I believe she laid on the 2nd July 1969? an( i she sat tightly until 21st
July, when she broke the infertile egg up in disgust. (Colour of egg buff,
slate blotches at larger end, estimated size 18 mm x 12 mm.)
This year 197* we have not had much time due to business pressures,
so have not attempted to breed any Sunbirds, although several were
ready. However, who knows perhaps 1971 may see a Hybrid Sunbird.

Apart from Bruning's (1969) article on rearing ruff Philomachus pugnax ,
there has been rather little published on techniques for rearing waders in
captivity. This article summarises our combined experience of rearing a
number of redshanks Tringa totanus , curlew Numenius arquata and lapwing
Vanellus vanellus. The small number of curlew and lapwing eggs was
taken from nests threatened with destruction. The much larger number
of redshank eggs were collected to provide tame birds for experiments
on feeding behaviour (Goss-Custard, 1970).
Incubation
Whenever possible, eggs were collected during the initial stages of
incubation since it was thought that they would then be most able to
survive being moved. Hatchability was high as long as the eggs were
incubated at a temperature of ioi-io2*F : all the 50 redshank, six curlew
and six lapwing eggs hatched. As with hens eggs, the eggs are extremely
sensitive to high temperatures and sustained exposure to io5*F, for
example, kills them.

Within 24 hours of hatching all but four (brood A) of the redshank
chicks were put into individual plastic cages measuring 16 ins. x 10 ins. by
q ins. high. These were lined with expanded polystyrene sheets for
warmth. A 100 watt infra-red heater was suspended 14 ins. above the
floor at one end and a small amount of cotton wool was placed beneath, . j
again for additional warmth. Brood A and all the curlew and lapwing
were reared for the first two weeks in a large cage which had two suspended
heating lamps and two cloth-wrapped hot-water bottles spread about.
Providing only one heating source proved inadvisable in a large cage
because the young chicks would sometimes wander away from the lamp,
become cold and die.
The chicks quickly discovered for themselves what could be eaten and
often swallowed novel food items within an hour of first being presented
with them. They were fed during the first few days on minced eel and
small pieces of boiled maggots, boiled egg, mealworm, meat and fish put
in a petri-dish filled with water. Giving greasy meat was avoided since
single birds would preen the oil into their feathers and birds in groups

splashed each other with the greasy water. This led to a loss of insulation
and eventually to death. The chicks readily took live food: water fleas,
greenflies* (especially for lapwings), moths, caterpillars, flies, larval locusts,
woodhce and small chopped earthworms were all popular. Duckweed
floating on water and turkey starter scattered over the floor were both
taken readily. Clean water was provided for drinking.
The individually reared redshank chicks were removed from their
boxes after about six days and transferred to a large cage measuring 9 ft. x
7 ft. x 8 ft. high where they were kept thereafter. The floor was covered
with peat and/or sand and no foot disorders developed although after
several months the redshanks' toe-nails needed cutting. The curlew,
lapwing and redshank brood A were transferred from their initial cage at
two weeks to a small room measuring 7 ft. x 7 ft. The floor was covered
with newspaper which was added to daily: again no foot troubles developed.
All the birds were provided with large dishes of water in which they
could bathe. Heating lamps were also provided for several weeks but by
the age of about four w eeks the birds rarely used them except for drying
themselves after bathing.
The curlew, lapwing and brood A of the redshank were fed mainly on
turkey starter and minced eel which had Bemax scattered over it. The
food was changed twice daily. The remaining redshank were also given
turkey starter along w r ith small pieces of liver, heart or fish in w r ater, boiled
ma SS*ts sod live mealworms. Some live food was given when it was
Available. A commercial vitamin additive for cage birds (" Trace ") was
also scattered on the food from time to time.
W e found that if the precautions we have noted were taken it was
r are to lose birds except through accident. A small number of redshank
ieveloped slight irregularities of the bill after a few months but these did
tot appear to impede their feeding. Up to ten redshank have now been
&lt;ept together in a large cage for up to tw r o years and seem to be in generally
excellent condition. The plumage is good although the legs are very pale,
^anthazanthin added to the food improves the leg colour somewhat but

rom social stress since isolation leads to a gradual and complete recovery.
Redshank become quite tame if exposed frequently to people: some

ant if tame birds are required to expose the young chicks to people as
arly and as much as possible. Desultory attempts to imprint two-day-old

redshank on a person failed when the chicks refused to follow the experi-
menter; the chicks may not even follow their parents in the wild. Curlew
seem similarly difficult to " imprint .
Age of Fledging and Growth Rates
Detailed records of fledging dates and growth rates were kept for a brood
of four redshanks and all the curlew and lapwing. The first redshank flew
at 20 days, the first lapwing at 29 days and the first curlew at 32 days.
The birds were weighed at weekly intervals for the first five weeks only:
thereafter weighing was stopped because the birds became very nervous
when handled.

Table I shows both the actual weights up to five weeks of age and the
relative increases obtained after adjusting all the hatching weights to
1-oo. These relative weight indices are also plotted in Fig. 1. Initially,
the rate of increase in all these waders was similar, but by two weeks of age
they were diverging, the lapwings showing a steeper climb than the curlews
and redshanks. After very early fledging, the redshank's growth curve
flattened somewhat. At five weeks, the lapwings had increased their
weight nearly tenfold, the curlew nearly ninefold and the redshank over
sevenfold.
Figure 1 also shows the growth curve of three ruff and one reeve reared
at the New York Zoo (Bruning 1969). The weight of these birds was
taken from two days of age, so the hatching weight has had to be calculated.
A figure of 15 g matches both the sort of gains expected of lapwing and
redshank in the first two days and the relative egg size--reeves laying
slightly smaller eggs than redshanks which in turn produce smaller eggs
than lapwings (Witherby et al. 1940). The ruffs and reeve have been
treated separately because, unlike the other three waders, there is a marked
sexual dimorphism in size in Philomachus pugnax. The growth curves of
both are markedly steeper than those of the other wader species. At only
four weeks, the ruffs had increased their weight over 11-fold to 169 g and,
the reeve nearly tenfold to 149 g. Of course, these differences between

species may merely be due to the small sizes of the samples or to a differing
reaction to captivity. On the other hand, the results may point to real
species differences in growth potential which reflect differences in the
average abundnnce of the food supply available to the species in the wild.

Ranging South from Texas to Peru, Green Jays are quite commonly
found in suitable areas in the wild. These small Jays are just under io in.
long and beautifully coloured with grass-green upperparts, lighter under-
neath, black bib, bill and legs, skyblue crown, nape and facial stripe and
pale yellow outer tail feathers. Our female Jay is of a lighter shade of
green altogether than the male and has a smaller bib.
Our original pair were brought from Mexico in March 1968, the female
dying just over a year later. At no time did they try to go to nest, though
they displayed frequently and appeared to be quite amicable.
A replacement female arrived in September 1969 and after initial
quarantining was placed with the male. On her release into the flight the
female immediately launched into display, bobbing up and down on a
branch with her feathers fluffed out, producing a dry rattling sound. She
broke off, beat the perch with her bill and gave the typical scolding alarm
call. She has since gone through the entire performance whenever she
sees someone she recognises, the male just gives a quiet chirrup and carries
on.
All went well and on the 16th November the male was observed courting
the female. With head and upper breast feathers sleeked and lower
breast and belly feathers fluffed out to form a " skirt ", he swayed up and
down a couple of inches from the unmoving female, whistling, chirping
and mimicking his neighbours in a very quiet love song.
On occasions one bird would appear to invite preening by sidling to
within an inch of the other, then freezing and slowly erecting the head and
crest feathers, the nape feathers rising first, then layer by layer all the
head feathers would stand on end. Frequently the birds would assume j
this posture simultaneously and would wait half a minute or so before
" coming to ".
At other times both birds would bob up and down with " skirts
spread, giving vent to a weird variety of loud, rattling, bubbling sounds.
On 1 st April 1970, the birds were transferred from their flight in the
Tropical Bird House to a large outside aviary containing four Golden
Pheasants (Crysolophus pictus). The Jays quickly settled down and were
soon seen to be going through their display rituals. On the 7th May a
large oval wire basket stuffed with hay was fixed up under shelter in the
flight. The Jays, overcoming their initial wariness, made a thorough
inspection and then appeared to ignore it. However, eight days later on
the 15th May two eggs were felt in the nest, a third following on the

16th and a fourth egg after that. The eggs were of very similar appearance
to those of a Blackbird (Turdus merula) and were brooded by the female
only for 17 days, the first egg hatching on 1st June 1970, the remainder
hatching the day after on 2nd June.
I The parents became increasingly aggressive and bounced off my head
pecking hard in passing during the daily servicing of their aviary, and they
had no hesitation about attacking the pheasants, should they try to roost
in the vicinity of the nest.
Being omnivorous birds, the Jays have received daily a little of all
available food, favouring insects and berries. When the chicks hatched
they received in addition to their usual mixture, a constant supply of
gentles and mealworms drenched in multivitamin solution, and ten new-
born mice four times a day--the size of the mice increasing with the size
af the chicks.
On hatching the chicks were very dark skinned and quite naked. They
were brooded very closely by the female, and both male and female took
part in the rearing. The male behaved very well, actually pushing the
female up off the chicks with his head, in order to feed them. All food
for the chicks was held in the foot, then pulled to pieces and held in the
aouch until it was passed on. The male was also seen to feed the female
)n the nest, both before and after the chicks hatched.
The chicks grew very rapidly and at twelve days old their pin feathers
were starting to open.
At nineteen days old the chicks left the nest, prematurely it seemed, as
lot one could fly, but all hopped very strongly over the ground and from
iranch to branch. The colouring of the chicks was more blue than that of
:he parents making them quite dull. If the chicks were worried by the
ipproaeh of a pheasant (which ignored them) they had only to squawk
or the parents to come and dive bomb the pheasant into retreat.
All went smoothly until June 22nd when the smallest chick was removed
rom the aviary, as it had suffered a slipped claw and had difficulty in
noving about. Unfortunately three days later the chick died. On the
&apos;9th June and 4th July we lost two other chicks. These were sent for a
&amp;gt;ost mortem examination but due to partial decomposition no conclusive
esults could be obtained.
This left us with one chick which, I am happy to say, has survived.
This was the first hatched specimen and has always been a little bit bigger
nd stronger than its nest mates. On the 4th July it was seen eating by
tself and on 13th July it was removed from its parents' aviary, as they
lad been observed to mate and displayed frequently. No more eggs
vere laid however and at the end of July the female started to moult.
The chick started to moult at the end of August and is now in fine adult
rather.

SUNBIRDS

By Bryan E. Reed (Wednesbury, Staffs., England)
This article relates to two near misses that my partner Albert Holmes
and myself had in attempting to breed van Hasselts Sunbirds (Nectarinia
sperata) in 1968 and 1969.
Our stock book records that the cock was purchased on 18th June 1966
and after a long search we obtained a hen on 28th October 1967.
They v/ere placed together to attempt breeding on 13th April 1968.
A month later on the evening of 15th May 1968 after playing with the
nesting material for a few days, the hen commenced to build in a finch
nest-basket. (The cock did not help, but only played with the material.)
The nest was finished on 20th May and she was seen tidying up the loose
strands on the 23 rd. She was first noticed sitting on 24th May. She
would leave the nest to feed immediately fresh nectar was put on the flight,
but after taking her fill she would go back at once. Two eggs were laid,
possibly on 22nd and 24th.
The hen became very aggressive on 30th May and began chasing the
cock about. We were forced to remove him to an adjoining flight on
1st June as the hen was attempting to kill him.
On 7th June at about 3 p.m. we heard a slight cheeping and the two
halfs of the egg were found on the floor about 5.45 p.m. She was given
a few small spiders and she fed the youngster by hanging on the outside
of the nest in the typical sunbird fashion.
The two halfs of the remaining egg were found on the floor on 8th June
at 9.30 a.m. The food taken was small spiders and fruit flies.
At about 7.30 p.m. on 20th June the hen seemed very restless and one
youngster was found dead well away from the nest on the 1 ith at 7-3* a * m -&amp;gt;
the other youngster was found dead in the nest on the 12th at 5 - 1 5 P* m *
(It was calling for food all day but she would not feed it, she only wanted
to sit on it and keep it warm.) The hen deserted the nest at about 3 p.m.,
12th June.
An infertile egg was found on the floor at 9 a.m. on 22nd June and the
cock was introduced to her again on 23rd. Another infertile egg was
found at 12 noon on the 23rd. She repaired the nest, but there were no
further developments and they commenced moulting about a month later.

They were placed in the flight to attempt breeding again in late April
1969. (The same flight as in 1968, i.e. a 3 ft. cube.) The nest was
started on 22nd May 1969 and finished on 27th May. As previously she
only built when the sun was shining. Eggs believed laid on 29th and
31st May. (Colour of two eggs: brownish fawn with a zone at the large
end of greyish brown. Slight fleckings of brown and grey. The two
areas are separated by a darkish brown band about ^ in. wide, size:
14 mm. x 10 mm. The other eggs are as follows: pinkish fawn with a
zone at the larger end of darkish brown fleckings which merge together.
Small grey and brown flecks over the rest of the egg. Size, 13 mm. x
9 mm. All eggs including remains of shells slightly different in colour.)
The hen then completely dashed our hopes by dying at 7.30 p.m. on
31st May 1969. I went down the aviary at about 6 p.m. and she looked
very fit and was jumping about. At 7 p.m. when I again visited the aviary
she was breathing very heavily with her eyes closed. She got steadily
worse (despite hospital cage treatment) and died in my hand at 7.30 p.m.
(A post mortem report revealed nothing.)
Since the above date we have been trying unsuccessfully to obtain
another hen, but up to now we have not been successful. If any
member could supply us with one, we would be very grateful.

Mr. Fitzsimmons has gathered a magnificent collection of Pheasants at
Livermore in Northern California. It is supervised by Mr. Vern Denton,
who owns the ranch on which the numerous and very well built avaries
stand.
Rare species only are kept there, with exception of pure, recently
imported stock of Golden and Amherst's Pheasants. Many Ocellated
Turkeys, different Junglefowls, Mikados and Ijima's have been reared,
for example. There are several pairs of many desirable birds, including
Malay, Bornean Argus, arrived lately, and a most remarkable collection
of Peacock-Pheasants: all the species are represented, including a pair of
Rothschild's (P. inopmatum ) and 1-3 Bornean (P. m. schleiermacheri ),
both extremely rare, and never before seen in captivity. The Rothschild's
have reared one young bird this year. All the tropical Pheasants, including
 |Green Java Junglefowls do exceedingly well at Livermore, which, being
inland, has a dry, hot summer, but Tragopans are not much inclined to
breed in such a climate and would no doubt be under better conditions
along the coast, where the climate is cooler and moister.

DIFFICULTIES IN VERIFYING
AVIARY-BREEDINGS OF NATIVE SPECIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998723170731708" page_id="58076428"  page_num="24" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
I would begin by defining an aviary-breeding as one in which two birds,
being kept under captive conditions, pair, build, lay, incubate, hatch
their own young, and successfully rear them.
The verification of a claim to have bred birds of a particular species under
aviary conditions raises a number of problems. The question of verifica-
tion does not normally arise where foreign bird breedings are concerned,
but in the case of native birds it might be possible to practise some decep-
tion when eggs and young of the species concerned are available in the
wilds within the same region.
It may be asked why one should assume that deception might occur.
I can only reply that it has been done in the past for relatively trivial
reasons, and that at present and for the next few years, there could be a
fairly strong incentive for doing this. Proposals have been made, and
are still under consideration, for a possible agreement on a limitation on
the range of native species entered for shows to those which are regularly
bred in captivity. Showing involves both monetary gain and status-
seeking of a kind, and there may be strong incentives to producing a long
list of species which are claimed to have been bred regularly, in order to
use them for this purpose. Deception has occurred in the past and there
is no reason to suppose it will not occur again. One of the most objec-
tionable features is that honest men can be, and have been, unwittingly used
for verifying some deceptions as true breedings, because they are unaware
of how these may be contrived. It therefore seems an appropriate time
to review the way in which apparent aviary-breedings can be so contrived,
in order that such people are aware of the problems involved.
Opportunity seems to present itself least with the seed-eating birds.
If a hen is seen sitting on a clutch of eggs of her own species, and later
seen feeding a nest of young, the only possible interference would be that
where a clutch of fertile eggs from elsewhere might be substituted for
infertile ones, or young birds switched for some reason. In the past
additional close-ringed young of such species were obtained by hand-
rearing wild young or by close-ringing young in a wild nest and taking
them when they were older. The fact that nests of young so ringed are
occasionally encountered by those ringing wild birds for migration studies
indicates that the latter method still persists to some extent.
This problem of verification is much greater in the case of insectivorous
species, including all small softbills, and similar types of birds, and also
such non-passerine species as woodpeckers. Once the young are hatched
and growing the parents of these species seem to build up a very strong
feeding drive. This fact was known and used by old-time bird keepers.

/
If the nestful of young are taken and one or both parents trapped, and
if these are then placed in an aviary and well-supplied with food', the
parents will continue to feed the young and rear them.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.99851" genericHeader="method" page_id="58076429" page_num="25" year="" vol="">
THIS MEANS THAT THE SIGHT OF ADULTS OF THESE
SPECIES FEEDING YOUNG IN OR OUT OF THE NEST IN AN
AVIARY IS NOT PROOF OF AN AVIARY BREEDING.

<bodyText confidence="0.999618026315789" page_id="58076429"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">
Such nestings are therefore very difficult to verify. Theoretically it
should be enough to see first the pair, then later the eggs, and then the
adults feeding young; but this is not so. The necessary steps would
appear to be firstly to have a pair recognisably marked in a way that is not
easily transferred to another bird, next to verify that the hen of that pair
is incubating eggs, and then to witness the hatching and first feeding stage
in the rearing of the young; since as far as we know the taking of young
and adults of these species from the wild is not successful for this method
in the first day or two after hatching. This would probably limit any
deception to switching of eggs or young in an actual breeding as in the case
of seed-eaters.
I understand from those interested in birds of prey that things are even
more complex with these. The females of such species will at times go
broody and accept a substitute nest and eggs, and incubate and rear.
There are records of such birds incubating and hatching domestic hens'
eggs, and one good record of a female Common Buzzard that hatched and
reared a cockerel! 1 o verify that a full and authentic breeding has
occurred is again extremely difficult.
When breeding is attested to by someone it is obviously preferable that
it should be someone with a knowledge of the ornithological background,
but not in a position to be influenced by ties of friendship, hope of gain,
or a belief in the need for a long list of breedings.
I am well aware that interference at critical periods may affect the
success of nesting, and that because of this some people are not prepared
to allow too much inspection of nesting birds; and that some may have
difficult) in arranging independent verification. I can only suggest
that such people may have to be content with the satisfaction of their own
knowledge of achievement, and the pleasure and information gained from
it; and that such breedings should be omitted from data on the range
and total of species bred.
In concluding I would repeat a comment which I appended to a list
of published accounts of aviary-breedings of European birds in Britain;
namely that in view of the deceptions which have been practised at times
the ultimate criterion in accepting a claim is the integrity of the breeder
concerned. Cynics may like to know that since publishing that comment
I have found that there is reason to believe that one breeding which I
wholly accepted at the time may have been a deception; but that doesn't
affect the validity of the comment.

(Uraeginthus bengalus and U. cyanocephalus)
By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
It has long been known that birds of many species, if reared by other
species, often , usually, or in some species, always , show their later sexual
responses partly , mainly or, in many cases, entirely towards the species
that stood in loco parentis to them. This often in spite of indifference or
even hostility from the creatures they eagerly court and sexual advances
from potential mates of their own species which they ignore.
It was assumed that such imprinting implied that there was no innate
recognition of the bird's own species (as there obviously was in such
species as cuckoos and whydahs) but Schutz s very detailed and compre-
hensive studies of imprinting in the Mallard and some other birds have
shown that there almost certainly is some innate species recognition, since
ducklings hatched and reared in complete isolation respond to their own
species on first seeing them in a choice situation , but that it can be
overlaid or obliterated by imprinting on foster parents of another
species. Schutz's experiments also showed that, at least in the Mallard
and some other species, there were individual differences in the degree
to which different individuals became imprinted and that, whereas male
Mallards imprint on their foster mother's kind (provided she is not too
unlike a duck!) female Mallards have an entirely innate response to the
male and " choose right " no matter what they have been reared by. In
ducks in which the sexes are alike, however, both sexes imprint.
Immelmann's (1969, 1970) experiments have shown that three com-
monly kept estrildines, the Zebra Finch, Bengalese Finch and African
Silverbill, when cross-fostered, also imprint firmly on the foster parent's
species and will ignore their own in choice situations.
Here I propose to describe the results of cross-fostering between
Red-cheeked Blue Waxbills or Cordon-bleus, Uraeginthus bengalus and
Blue-headed Waxbills or Blue-capped Cordon-bleus, Uraeginthus
cyanocephalus . As some of my readers will (I hope) remember, I have
for the past several years been keeping these and some other w axbills in
a small indoor room. The conditions are not ideal and the room usually
rather crowded but the birds nest freely and rear more young than is
convenient in most years, if not as many as they would if they were less
numerous. I have not made any deliberate cross-fostering experiments,
but have sometimes transferred eggs of Blueheads to Cordon-bleus when
insect food was in short supply and I had pairs of Cordon-bleus that I
knew would give egg food and milksop to the young which the particular

Bluehead pairs involved would not at that time do. Other cross-fosterings
have come about through pairs of one species laying in or (more often)
taking possession of the nest and eggs of another species.
For reasons which I hope to discuss in a future article, adoption of
young by other birds often occurs after they have left the nest, so that
flying broods are sometimes being fed by as many as five different indi-
viduals of three different species.
Case Histories
(1) Bluehead male " Double Orange " (all birds are named from their
colour rings), and his sister " Orange Left " fledged on 1st September
1969 together with one young Cordon-bleu, from a nest in which a pair
of Cordon-bleus had incubated. I must confess that it came as a complete
surprise to me when I caught the first fledgling to ring it and found it was
cyanocephalus not bengalus.
After they had fledged, Double Orange and his sister were adopted by
a male and female of their own species and regularly fed by them as well
as by their Cordon-bleu foster parents.
Double Orange was first seen to show sexual behaviour on 28th Decem-
ber 1969, when he responded with sexual approach and tail twist to a
displaying male Cordon-bleu. Within a few weeks it was evident that
he was sexually attracted to both sexes of Cordon-bleus. I was not able
to make more than intermittent observations, so that I may well have
missed interesting items of behaviour. It is, however, likely that what I
saw was a " fair sample ".
So far as I observed Double Orange had no preference as to the sex
of his prospective partners. He was seen actively to court female Cordon-
bleus, deliberately flying to or after them, nesting symbol in bill, and
displaying at them much more often than to males; conversely he was
more often seen to approach a male displaying with the symbol and greet
it sexually. He was also twice seen to attempt to rape a hen Cordon-bleu
but was not seen to make such an attempt on a male. These differences
were, I think, due to the differing behaviour of the sexes in the Cordon-
bleus (males perform the " straw-display " much more frequently than
females and tend to be more aggressive and quicker to repulse unwanted
sexual attentions) rather than to any difference in Double Orange's
feelings or reactions.
By June 1970 he was paired to a male Cordon-bleu " Orange Left ".
Probably to a Cordon-bleu a Blue-head of either sex does not appear to be
a male, as it has no red cheek patches.
(2) Bluehead female " Orange Left ". Nest sister of Double Orange,
see above for early experiences. Like her brother this bird showed no
sexual interest in conspecifics of either sex. She was, however, unlike

her brother, never seen to show interest in female Cordon-bleus but only
in males. She responded repeatedly and vainly, to the stem-display of
males of bengalus but never showed any interest at all when a male Blue-
head displayed near or (as happened on at least one occasion) at her. She
died, possibly through injuring herself in a night panic, during a period
when I was away from home in May 1970.
(3) Bluehead female " Mauve Left ". Hatched and reared by Cordon-
bleus to whom I had given a clutch of Bluehead eggs. Fledged together
with her two sisters " Green Right " and " Green Left " on 18 August
1967. After fledging these young Blueheads were all regularly fed by a
male Bluehead as well as by the Cordon-bleu pair that had hatched them.
Reacted sexually only to male Cordon-bleus. By June 1968 she was
clearly deeply attached to a particular male Cordon-bleu (" Double Red "),
whose attitude towards her varied from indifference to hostility. She
showed intense interest in all his nesting activities, in spite of opposition
from him and his mate, and fed all their broods of young as soon as they
left the nest. I think she would have fed them in the nest as well had
their parents been less hostile towards her. She died in November 1970.

(4) Female "Green Left"; sister of "Mauve Left" (&lt; q.v .) and
" Green Right ". This hen was also completely imprinted on Cordon-

bleus and showed sexual reactions only to males of this species. For a
short period in May 1968 she was actively courted by a male of her own
species but she was indifferent to him although at the same time herself
actively but vainly making advances to males of bengalus. She died in
December 1969.
(5) Female " Green Right"; sister (same brood as " Green Left"
and " Mauve Left ". This bird, unlike her sisters and the other female
Bluehead, " Orange Left ", similarly reared by Cordon-bleus, showed no
sexual reactions to Cordon-bleus but paired with a male of her own species.
She is still alive and paired to him. This pair have, however, been very
unsuccessful at breeding and, perhaps because of this, " Green Right "
has adopted several broods, of both Cordon-bleus and Blueheads, after
they have fledged and fed them as regularly as, and sometimes for an even
longer period than their own parents have done.
(6) Two female Cordon-bleus, hatched and reared by Blueheads.
Fledged on 22nd August 1967. Neither of these showed any sexual
reactions to Blueheads but responded and paired in a normal manner to
males of their own species. During part of the period that these two
young Cordon-bleus were out of the nest but still dependent, they were
in company with a brood of Blueheads that had been reared by Cordon-
bleus. Although their foster father (and a hen Bluehead not paired to
him) fed both lots of young, I never saw the Cordon-bleus, that were
rearing the young Blueheads, feed these two young of their own species,
although I kept a sharp watch for it as I more than half expected them to.

Although the numbers of birds involved are not " statistically signifi-
cant some comment and speculation seems justified, partly because when
one is dealing with living things the behaviour of individuals, however
few, is in itself of interest and partly because, the behaviour of even a few
individuals in particular circumstances is usually a fair sample of what the
reaction of much larger, even " statistically significant ", numbers of the
same species would be in comparable circumstances.
One cock and three hen Blueheads, that were hatched and reared by
Cordon-bleus, became completely imprinted on that species even though
they were fed as well by both sexes of their own species after fledging, one
lien Bluehead that was so reared proved not to be imprinted. Two
explanations, perhaps not mutually exclusive, seem possible. There
may (as Schutz found with Male Mallards) be individual differences in
the tendency to imprint, or perhaps it might be more correct to say in the
tendency of (presumed) innate recognition of its own species to be
obliterated by imprinting. On the other hand it is possible that the male
Bluehead that fed this brood after fledging may (although I did not see it)
perhaps have gone into the nest, or put his head in the entrance and fed
this young bird (only) before the stage at which she had got fully imprinted
on her foster father bengalus. I have recently seen a male Bluehead
sneak into a Cordon-bleus' nest to feed young only a week old. I watched
a good deal and saw him try to do so at other times but be chased off by
the male Cordon-bleu. It is then, not certain that " Green Right " was
so clear an exception to the " general rule " as she appeared to be.
In view of the complete and apparently irrevocable imprinting on the
foster species in three out of four female Blueheads (and the one male),
it is at first surprising that the two female Cordon-bleus fostered by Blue-
heads showed sexual responses only to their own species. Assuming,
which I think is much more likely than not, that they were a fair sample
albeit such a small one, the answer may, perhaps, be found in the different
types of sexual dichromatism of the males of these two related species.
Although his entirely bright blue head and richer brown upperparts (see
Goodwin 1962, 1965) make the cock Bluehead very different in appearance
from the hen, this difference is one of relative brightness or depth of
colours and relative extent of blue on the head. In the Cordon-bleu,
however, the crimson cheek patches of the male provide him with a
conspicuous badge of his sex, no least nuance of which is possessed by the
female. Extrapolating from what is known to be the case with ducks
r (Schutz 1965), it seems reasonable to suppose that the female Cordon-bleu
} could more easily have evolved an innate recognition of her mate's
appearance or, alternatively, that such innate recognition would be less
I liabIe t0 obliteration by imprinting than would be the case with the
f Bluehead. The difference between the two species would thus be

<bodyText confidence="0.973362261904762" page_id="58076434"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
comparable to that existing between the female Mallard and the female
Chilean Teal. Although I have had no experience with male Cordon-
bleus reared by Blueheads, or any other species, I think it is highly likely
that, like male Mallards, they would imprint. I think this not only from
analogy with the findings on ducks but also from the fact that they
discriminate very well between females of their own species and the \ery
similarly-coloured female Blueheads. An intriguing piece of behaviour
was that on four occasions when I saw a female Bluehead (one of the
imprinted ones) deliberately and intensely solicit a male Cordon-bleu
(three different Cordon-bleus involved) with the invitation to coition,
which is identical in both species, she was fiercely attacked by him. These
attacks were violent and the Cordon-bleus showed no signs of sexual
arousal, they did not make the " triangular head " as waxbills do in sexual
contexts.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to account for the fury of the attacks other
than by some frustration and I suspect that, possibly at what would in
humans be called a subconscious level, the male Cordon-bleus were
sexually stimulated by the invitation display and their being inhibited
from responding sexually because of the female's " wrong " specific
characters caused them to become angry and attack.
Recognition of Young
It seems worth making a few comments on this subject here as it has
been claimed for some estrildines that they will not rear young of other
species, that have not the same mouth markings as their own, or, in some
cases, will not rear them unless they have no young of their own.
The mouth markings of young bengalus and cyanocephalus are the same
or very closely similar (Goodwin 1965). They differ, however, in
cyanocephalus lacking the dark blue tubercles at the gape and they have,
(even to my ears whose relative lack of acuity is a standing joke to some of
my friends who go in for sound-recording) very different-sounding begging
calls, especially after leaving the nest. Yet, as has been shown, both
bengalus and cyanocephalus will rear young of the other species, a pair of
Cordon-bleus reared a mixed brood, showing no preferences; Cordon-
bleus reared a brood of Blueheads and, after they had fledged, discrimina-
ted in their favour between them and Cordon-bleus of similar age. It
might be added that all the fosterers involved either had or did rear young
of their own species in former or subsequent broods.
Summary
A male Blue-headed Waxbill, Uraeginthus cyanocephalus , reared by
Red-cheeked Cordon-bleus and fed after fledging both by its foster
parents and by a male and a female of its own species reacted sexually in
later life to both sexes of U. bengalus and not to birds of its own species.

Three females similarly reared responded only to males of bengalus. A

interesting cases.
Considering that Cleres is now mostly a show place, overrun by numer-
ous visitors, and also the large variety of the species of birds we keep,
not to speak of the mammals, the above results can be considered quite
satisfactory.
The collections and installations have been considerably improved
during 1970. The galleries for delicate small birds, installed in the halls
of the chateau, are a great attraction, as well as the well-landscaped
outdoor aviaries, now 50 years old. All are perfectly kept thanks to the skill
and care of Dr. Ciarpaglini, and Jacques Dupre, the Head keeper.
Among the interesting novelties acquired in 1970, are a member of
African Sunbirds, some Hummingbirds and small insectivorous birds.
A pair of African Trogons ( Apaloderma narina) are doing well, eating
fruit and vegetables as well as insectile food, cake, meat and mealworms.
I had never before seen them in captivity. Kori Bustards have proved a
problem, as they will eat any egg or small bird they come across, and they
cannot be kept free in the park as I had hoped.
We were disappointed with the Crowned Pigeons, of which we had a
number belonging to the three species. Only one pair (Crested) have
laid, outside the nest! An old pair in an indoor aviary of the old Jardin des
Plantes, in Paris, never ceased rearing young there . . . Luck plays a great
part in bird breeding successes. One cannot make a poor pair nest; but
of course, it is easy to stop a good one from doing so.

FRUIT DOVE

(Ptilinopus leclancheri)
By Donald G. Hanover (Tarzana, California, U.S.A.)
Some three or four years ago, I purchased a pair of Black-Chinned
Fruit Doves. They remained quite inactive until the Spring of 1969,
at which time they mated and built a typical flimsy dove nest in a
large shrub. No egg was laid. The male died suddenly a few weeks
later.
These doves are a little biggei than the Barbary Dove, with bold, if
subdued colouring. On the male the back, wings and tail are rich green
and there are yellow fringes and edges on flight feathers; while head, neck
and breast are silver-grey, with a small black throat patch. The duller
green underside is separated from the grey breast by a broad blackish-
chestnut band, and the under tail coverts are warm buff. The irides
are red, and the bill yellow with a purplish base. The female has grey-
green on head, neck and breast; a duller, browner throat patch, and a
smaller breast-band.
Early in 1970, I was able to obtain another male, which immediately
became very active and attentive to the hen. In April and May the doves
nested on the ground without success. In June, again nesting on the
ground, their single egg appeared. Twenty days later, on 28th June,
the white, pigeon-sized, but elongated egg hatched. The youngster's
colour was light-pink, with sparse white down and also elongated shaped,
for the first two days.
These doves are highly arboreal. Just why they nested on the ground
I do not presume to know. The only explanation I can offer is their
being in captivity, their lives are no longer natuial or normal.
The egg hatched during the day while the cock was brooding. When
the hen took over in late afternoon, she failed to cover the youngster,
sitting about 8-10 inches away. I was reluctantly getting ready to take
the youngster and try to hand-feed it when I noticed the large section
of the hatched egg-shell lying nearby. I gently slipped it over the rear
of the youngster, then left the area. In a few minutes the hen moved in
and covered the youngster. The same procedure had to be repeated the
second evening, but the following evening the hen fully accepted the
youngster without benefit of the half-shell cover. I don't believe the
egg-shell would have fitted the youngster on the third evening.
On 7th July, the youngster walked about three feet away from the
nesting site, then flew to a low limb the next day, even though he was
quite naked except for some wing-feathers and a short tail. He stayed
off the ground during the day, but for three nights returned to it near the

nesting site, where he was covered by the hen. Both parents were very
attentive and protective until the youngster was fully on his own, which
was approximately the first week in August. On August 19th, the doves
nested again, but this time off the ground in a shrub, with the egg hatch-
ing on 7th Sept. This youngster left the nest when it was two weeks
old. To the best of my observations it has never touched the floor of
the pen.
I have had some of my various fruit doves for about six years, always
feeding them boiled brown rice and, either fresh or canned fruit, but am
convinced that this is not the correct diet. I lost a few fruit doves.
Though they were always in good flesh, they died suddenly. In
January 1970, I changed their feed to Mynah Bird pellets, and every
other day to grated sharp cheese, and a small amount of fresh fruit once
or twice a week. Now my fruit doves look better as well as fly better,
and one pair has nested.

THE BREEDING OF WEBER'S LORIKEET
(Trichoglossus haematodus weben)

<bodyText confidence="0.932962238095238" page_id="58076438"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
By R. T. Kyme (Kirton, Lincolnshire, England)
Comparatively little has been written about Weber s Lorikeet either
in freedom or captivity. I searched through a copy of Mivart's Lories
at London Zoo Library but found very little information and no coloured
plates. However, I did find a coloured plate in Dr. Max Wilhelm Carl
Weber's Zoologische Ergebnisse einer Reise in Niederlandisch Ost-Indien ,
Band III, page 290, plate XVII, 1894.
According to Peter's Check List of Birds of the World , volume III, |
Weber's Lorikeets come from the Island of Flores.
The sexes look very much alike, my cock bird having a little bolder
head. The general body colouring is a rich deep green, with breast and
collar of a contrasting light green with a yellowish tint. (Some museum
skins show a very little light blue on the extreme front of the forehead
--Eds.) The beak is orange and the feet greyish. It is a small bird
with a total length of about 275 mm. They are most attractive aviary
birds with never a dull moment. They are in my opinion exceptionally
fascinating. Their mating display is elaborate with amusing poses.
I purchased four Weber's Lorikeets from John Wilson of Old Catton
after seeing them in his birdroom on several occasions over a period of
two years. He delivered them on 1st July 1969 not knowing their sexes.
They soon settled down in a small aviary 6 ft. high x 3 ft. wide x 8 ft. j

long, the shelter being 2 ft. and made of flat asbestos. A nest-box
6 |in. x 6f in. x 14 in. high with 2.\ in. entrance hole was placed in the
open flight and it was not long before the Weber's were busy inspecting
it.
The nest-box contained about 4 in. of a mixture of peat and sawdust.
I had intended also to place pebbles and peiforated zinc at the bottom
but I'm afraid this never got done. They all slept in the nest-box at
night and one could hear their calls at various times of the night. Some
time later one of them appeared to be odd man out so I removed him from
the aviary and placed him in the birdroom.
The cold and frosty weather did not appear to affect them. However
their nectar kept getting frozen up so I decided to take them into my
birdroom. I hey did not stay there long as it was obvious they preferred
the open flight. I decided to place the fourth one back with the others
and although they appeared to get on well together I came home one day
to find him dead.
Some time later my wife called me and said that the Weber's weie
mating. I was thrilled, for to my knowledge I know of no record of
Weber's being bred and at least this was a step towards my
goal. In late January I noticed two of the remaining three were spending
most of theii time in the nest-box and on approaching their aviary the
cock would immediately fly to the perch on the nest-box and call the
hens out, so I decided when they came out of their nest-box I would
close them in the shelter and have a peep. I was thrilled when I saw
three white eggs which measured 28 mm. x 22 mm.
Both hens sat well but as we all know it was very cold and frosty so
I thought I had little hopes of the eggs hatching. I inspected the eggs
occasionally and my hopes ran high for the eggs were dark and on the
25th February I found two baby Lorikeets had hatched. Unfortunately
they only lived for three days. They had blackish beaks and were
covered with white down. I took the dead Lorikeets along to our local
chemist who preserved them for me in formalin. I must say he is a
most helpful man with my bird problems.
As I could now sex my Weber's at a glance I decided now was the time
to remove one of the hens. Elaborate displaying and mating was observed
3n several occasions and it was not long before they were nesting again.
They made two further attempts before they got down to serious
aesting.
The first egg was laid on 20th May and the second on the 22nd. The
len sat well but she soon poked her head out of the box whenever one
ipproached their aviary. On the 15th June the first chick hatched,
he second on the 17th June. They were covered with white down
vhich later turned greyish. Their beaks were blackish.
I As soon as the chicks hatched I offered the Weber's maggots and
nealworms but they were not interested. Their nectar was made up

as follows: 6 oz. water, i heaped teaspoonful of Horlicks, 3 teaspoons of
Baby Rice, 1 teaspoon of Nestle's Full Cream Condensed Milk and
1 teaspoon Gale's Honey. The Weber's relished apple before the young-
sters were hatched but left it alone once they were hatched and in fact
did not take it again until they left their nest.
I decided I would like a pictorial record of the breeding of Weber's
so I took coloured slides of the youngsters at regular intervals from the
age of 14 days. One morning I went to feed the Weber's and I found
one inch solid of black ants in their nectar bowl so I had to act quickly.
I borrowed one of my wife's Pyiex dishes and formed a moat around the
nectar. I'm very pleased to say this did the trick and stopped any
further invasions. They were noisy feeders and unfortunately they
plucked the youngsters on the breast and back.
The first day I noticed a youngster peeping out of the nest-box was
on 7th August. The youngsters had grown well but were slow at
feathering. They ate a lot of flowering and seeding sowthistle, also
seeding spinach beet which they lelished.
The youngster left the nest on 13th August but returned again at
night. F01 this I was very pleased owing to the fact they were plucked
and I did not want it to catch a chill. The second youngster left the
nest on the 14th August. The youngsters were smaller editions of
their parents except for their beaks, one had a reddish brown beak,
the other a blackish red beak. Could this be a sex distinction? After
leaving the nest they soon started to drink nectar and eat spinach beet.
They always returned to their nest-box at night.
Sweet apples were relished after the youngsters left the nest. They
continued to develop and feather up on the breast and back. They
were strong flyers from the start. On Friday, 25th September, it was
noticed that the young Weber's were becoming very aggressive towards
their parents so they were moved to another flight.
The young Weber's were seen by K. Russell on 15th August, John
Wilson on 9th September and H. Jordan on nth October.
As described above, R. T. Kyme has bred Weber's Lorikeet
Trichoglossus haematodus weberi , the green-breasted subspecies of the
species. It is believed this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this sub-
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate
at once with the Hon. Secretary.

With a major new bird building, titled THE WORLD OF BIRDS, on
the horizon, the first ten months of 1970 has been one of the most active
periods in the long avicultural history of the Bronx Zoo. For some years
the small bird collection here has been allowed to decline through natural
attrition without replacement. Now with new displays, tailored basically
for tropical perching birds, this section of the bird collection is being
carefully rebuilt with a special eye toward the educational themes to be
put forth in these new displays, emphasizing ecology, behaviour and
zoogeography. Among the more interesting specimens received recently
and also new to our collection were:

Breeding results for the 197* season were disappointing in the number
of species breeding and the number of birds reared but several of the
successes are worthy of special mention :
Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber, reproduced for the third season. A
single chick was reared.
Red-cheeked Ibis Comatibus eremita , reared a chick for the first time
here. The parent birds were progeny of the Basel Zoo colony in
Switzerland.
Puna Plover Charadrius alticola, a single chick reared. Probably a
first captive breeding; the nest and eggs of this species were first
described in 1965.

Tufted Puffin Lunda cirrhata , an egg noted in a nesting burrow on
June 19th 1970 hatched on July 26th. The young puffin emerged from
the burrow on September 15th. We can find no record for a captive
breeding for this species or for any member of the Alcidae.
One of the more interesting research problems taken on by the depart- |
ment involved captive rearing of a very specialized waterfowl species from
the high Andes Mountains of South America, the Torrent Duck Merga-
netta armata. Mr. Marvin Cecil, a Florida based aviculturist, studied |
these birds on the wild mountain streams of Argentina during 1968 and
1969. He imported fertile eggs to Florida in 1968 but failed to rear the
ducklings hatched there. On 12th December 1969, Mr. Cecil, on
pre-arrangement with the bird staff here, arrived in New York with thirteen
torrent duck eggs, in a portable incubator and three ducklings that had
hatched, en route from South America. In all, three pairs of these unusual
water birds were reared here and now resemble adults in all aspects but
the bright carmine coloration of bills and feet seen on wild specimens.
The ducklings were started with live food items that included: bloodworms
(Chironomus), brine shrimp (Artemia) and newly-hatched mealworms
(Tenebrio). This small flock now thrives on Turkey growing pellets
(a commercially pelleted ration) dog meal and finely chopped kale.

the same year. We put the birds into a large flight cage of our pheasantry
where they lived together with several Spoonbills, a pair of Woolly-necked
Storks, a Northern Black-headed Gull, a Mew Gull, Anhingas and another
Silver Gull that we had imported from Australia several years ago. In
1970, we observed for the first time breeding activity. The first clutch, j
laid at the end of June, got lost. On August 9th, two other eggs were
laid and incubated until September 2nd.
When the young hatched we feared at first that they would be injured
by the storks and the other gulls, but just the contrary happened. The
more the young gulls grew up, the more their parents cared for them and
defended them. As the chicks changed their juvenile plumage, the adults
became so aggressive that they continuously attacked all other inhabitants
of the aviary. In order to protect them we took them out and brought
them into another cage. At the moment, the large cage is occupied only
by the parent Silver Gulls and their offspring.

Such is the number of Seagulls using a highway along the North
Carolina coast to crack clam shells that considerable damage has been
done to motorists' tyres by the sharp pieces of broken shell.
The State Highway Commission has now constructed three ioo-foot
long asphalt crash-pads in the hope the Gulls will use them instead
of the road. Being closer to the water and, of course, free of traffic, many
Gulls are indeed showing a preference.

The idea of trying to establish the Great Bustard Otis tarda in Great
Britain seems to have captured the imagination of the national press and
radio broadcasting alike--both, ever on the look-out for novelties--have
given the project very considerable publicity.
Six birds, two male and four female, have already been imported from
Portugal. I he present idea is to release them in the spring on a ten-acre
i site, surrounded by an eight-foot wire fence, on Salisbury Plain.
A Great Bustard Trust has been formed. It is greatly hoped that the
present venture, unlike several previous, small abortive attempts, will
prove an unqualified success, and that the expected expenditure of about
#10,000 will be fully justified.

apple from my hand. Besides the two Weber's Lorikeets I have bred
and reared six Stanley's, four Mealy Rosella, four yellow Red-rumped,
six Red-rumped, and io Turquoisine. I also had four lovely young
Pennant's Parrakeets but my Green-naped Lories attacked their feet the
day they came out of the nest, and unfortunately I had to destroy them.
I always enjoy Dr. Maurice Burton's weekly " Nature Notes " in The
Daily Telegraph. My regret is that the limited space at his disposal
necessitates their being very brief. But here, fortunately, there is virtually
no limitation. In a recent issue he dealt with "Winter Canaries",
meaning Siskins. Siskin is the substantive name of several Carduehs
(or Spinus) species, but in Great Britain its use is confined to Carduelis
spinus. The derivation is probably from the Danish Sidsken , or Swedish
Siska, a " chirper ". It has long been known in England as a cage-bird--
Turner mentioned it as such under that name in 1544.
An obsolete bird-catcher's name is Abadavine or Aberduvine (there are
several variants). It was first used by Albin in 1735* ^ ut lts of igi n seems
to be unknown.
The Siskin has several nicknames. At one time it was known in
Sussex as the Barlev-bird, on account of its appearing at the time barley
was ripe; Black-headed Thistle Finch, Golden Wren, and Tea-leaves.

An item of special interest is recorded in the 92 nd Annual Report ,
of The Royal Zoological Society of South Australia . In Septem-
ber, 1969, we were again fortunate enough to obtain nine young Ostrich
chicks from the centre of the State. As they were not more than two days
old when they arrived it was almost inevitable that some losses would occur
during the hand-rearing process. We were able, however, to raise six,
two of which were sent to Taronga Zoo and one to Perth Zoo. South
Australia is the only State where ostriches were " farmed " many years
ago and only a few feral birds, remnants of the farms, now exist. Because
of the ban on importing birds from overseas it is important to try to
perpetuate this species in Australian zoos from the small stock that now
remains ". .
The breeding situation with birds was quite satisfactory, with 42 species
bred and 149 young reared. These included 20 psittacine, nine dove and
five pheasant species. Notables were two Rheas, eight Brush Turkeys
and three Grey Teal.

seen the number of different kinds dwindle from a possible thirty to about
a dozen (including varieties). These include a yellow-banded Golden
(a strain developed from one having some trace of Amherst, in a male, ten
or more generations back). For your interest I will list those now left,
from a census I did six years ago for the members of the Ornamental
Pheasant Society (now disbanded). This is still virtually unchanged, but
some ring-necked varieties are being bred for commercial purposes in
larger numbers: Common Pheasant (including English ring-necked,
Mongolian ring-necked, black-necked and melanistic), Silver, Golden,
Amherst, Reeves, Nepalese, Swinhoe's, Edwards' and Cheer Pheasant are
those now left.
Recently a gift of a Green Peahen to Taronga Zoo saved them from
extinction here; although there are plenty of Blue Peafowl, with a few of

Helmeted Guineafowl from a strain of Silver Guineafowl which I imagine
are common elsewhere in the world ".

Dr. William S. Hawkins, Sunland, California, writes: " This year the
breeding season in Southern California was disappointing for almost all
aviculturists. We had one of the hottest and driest seasons on record which
is no doubt a major contributing factor. A number of my rarer birds
mated, including Meyer's Parrots, Queen of Bavaria's Conures, and
Aymara Parrakeets to name three--all with fertile eggs which failed to
hatch or with young which were not raised. Does one ever become
completely inured to these frustrations? I raised one beautiful Derbyan
Parrakeet with help in hand-feeding from my very good friend Mrs. Paul
Schneider who is truly an expert in this field. Various Rosellas tried and
- failed, with the exception of the Stanley's who had a number of fine young.
I was able to foster successfully Splendid Parrakeets under Bourke parents
which seemed a questionable project but worked out very well and, I
might add, the Bourke parents seemed particularly solicitous of their
- " unusual offspring ". Of five varieties of cockatoos, only the Rose-
breasted were successful and they produced only one round as opposed to
the two that they usually produce. Leadbeater's, of which I have raised
many in the past, did not even lay.
The Schneiders have now moved safely into their beautiful new home
and their birds were transferred safely: a trip of some sixty miles and
accomplished in the height of our summer heat ".

ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF AVICULTURE. Edited by A. Rutgers and

K. A. Norris. London: Blandford Press, 197*- Vol. I. Price # 8 .
This is an English edition of a work published in Dutch in 1864-1968,
and is the first of three volumes. While it is valuable to try and bring
together all the information on a particular subject, it is a little dangerous
to attempt a uniform encyclopaedic coverage of all aspects. In the present
instance the work seems to suffer from some uncertainty of purpose, and
after a series of rather short introductory essays on various topics it
becomes a systematic encyclopaedia of birds, treating a selection of them
species by species.
These are arranged in a systematic scientific sequence, and the present
volume deals with the earlier non-passerines, starting with the ostriches,
and passing through the larger seabirds, herons, waterfowl, birds of prey,
cranes, rails and waders, to pigeons. At least one species of each family
is included; and in those popular with aviculturists a large range of species
is described. The information for each consists of names in four languages,
a note on distribution, a brief description and indication of size, and
general information on the species covering habits, nesting and food.
Finally there are comments on it as an aviary bird. These last vary
considerably in content, at times being a sentence or two, often based on
early accounts, while at others a detailed breeding account may be quoted
at length. In general however they have a tendency to be a little vague
and generalized where one would like them to be more specific, particularly
as regards the species' precise requirements.
In the case of the more popular groups--such as waterfowl, pheasants
and pigeons--there is an introductory section of several pages for each,
giving general information on care and housing requirements, and
including instruction and diagrams on suitable aviary structures.
Some of the introductory essays might with advantage have been longei.
Bird structure, eggs and nesting are all covered briefly in a brief review
of the Class Aves ", but many aviculturists would like more information,
on such topics. " Notes on bird ecology as applied to planted aviaries
by Hawkins would appear to be the only serious discussion on the beha-
vioural background to the problem of keeping birds in aviaries. I would
not agree with his suggestion that small greenhouses are most useful for
tropical birds, for in our English climate at any rate the problems ol
excessive heat in summer and loss of heat in winter render them some of
the less useful structures. There is a valuable and up-to-date section on
treatment and diagnosis of diseases, but again I feel it merits more space
and greater comprehensiveness.
The work is a little unfortunate in its illustrations. &apos;1 here is a number
of passable colour plates that tend to fail in the final details of accuracy
and observation; and some plates of pigeons that appear to have originated

from an early nineteenth-century work. Black and white plates show
reduced versions of pictures that appear to originate as large colour plates
from Gould and his contemporaries. There are usually about five to a
page, oddly interspersed with modern photographs of other species,
reproduced at the same size. A large proportion of the species described
are also illustrated with small drawings in the text. These vary from the
passable to the inaccurate, those of the waders and pigeons being particu-
larly bad; and some of the pheasants appear to be poor adaptations of the
Gould plates that are also included.
In general this may be regarded as an encyclopaedia of birds which will
be useful to those who do not have access to a range of books on birds
of the world, containing a great deal of information on aviculture and
forming a useful introduction to it. I consider, however, that it lacks
the detail that an aviculturist, turning to some unfamiliar group of birds,
might hope to find; and that as an encyclopaedia it tends to be ornitho-
logical rather than avicultural. I here are also various errors, ranging
from mis-statements such as that Philip Wayre re-introduced Elliot's
Pheasant (and not Swinhoe's) to Taiwan, to editorial mishaps such as the
un-captioned diagram on page 40, which tend to shake one's confidence
in the work. This first volume is disappointing; one hopes that the
others may be a little better.

SOFTBILLED BIRDS. By Clive Roots. London: J. Gifford Ltd.,
1970. Price #2.
The term " softbill " is an unfortunate legacy to aviculture from an era
of semi-literate bird-keepers and usually meant a bird which does not
eat seed. This could cover an enormous range of avian species, and would
in fact include the vast majority of them. In the present work the author
has attempted to limit his field by redefining his terms of reference to
cover birds " with relatively soft bills (sic), which feed upon insects and
larger prey animals and soft plant material, and whose young are helpless
at birth ". The author was until recently in charge of " The Winged
World " at Morecambe, which has produced an impressive list of first
breedings of such birds and this is certainly one of the best books of this
type that I have recently encountered; but I could not help feeling that
he might have limited the work to those species of which he has had special
experience and which might have been discussed in greater detail; and
that an attempt to cover a wide range of family in a book of 143 pages
had inevitably led to much generalisation and trivial comment.
The first 71 pages are concerned with the acquisition and care of soft-
bills and the author's experience is evident throughout. Establishment
and acclimatization are dealt with. The section on housing seems to me
too brief and as one who has tried keeping birds in a converted greenhouse

I feel that the difficulties involved are glossed over much too easily. The
emphasis throughout is on the keeping of mixed groups of species in
enclosures. Nutrition and food is allotted some 30 pages and is probably
the most valuable section of the book. It is supplemented by an additional
appendix on proven diets for the various kinds of birds. There is a
brief chapter on ailments with a good section on deficiency diseases, to
which birds of this type are particularly prone.
The second part deals with the various groups of softbills, which are
subdivided into nectivorous, omnivorous, insectivorous and carnivorous.
It is here that I feel the book's defect lies in that it can allow at times only
two or three brief paragraphs for a whole family, and it is impossible to
do the birds justice, and brief, and at times a little misleading, generalisa-
tions become necessary.
There are 24 colour plates showing 36 species by colour photograph.
They show a range of the more unusual species and are often striking, but
of variable quality and somewhat uneven coverage on the diversity of
species involved. There are a few text illustrations of aviaries, nest-sites,
and some poor ones of birds.
Criticisms apart, this is a useful addition to literature on practical bird
keenine and one to be recommended to all aviculturists.

THE FOLKLORE OF BIRDS. By Edward Armstrong. New York:
Dover Publications Inc., 197*- Pnc e 3 ' 5 * d*U ars -
All those interested in the subject will welcome the appearance of a
second edition of this account of an enquiry into the origin and distribution
of some magico-religious traditions first published in 195^- The reader
is presented with more than a collection of beliefs and customs concerning
birds, and is invited to seek not only the historical origin but the psycho-
logical and sociological significance of bird folklore. The author starts
with an account of the prehistoric background to bird folklore and
especially the remarkable discoveries of certain cave paintings such as
those at Lascaux which show that people of the early Stone Age were
not only skilled craftsmen but also had magico-religious conceptions.
Some of the paintings in the cave of Lascaux indicate that bird cults
probably flourished in Upper Palaeolithic times.
The succeeding chapters, in the main, approach the subject in the reverse
way and starting from modern customs and beliefs trace them back as far
as possible into the past. The Michaelmas goose is the first to be con
sidered with its gastronomic and ritual importance. Bird-maidens includes
many variants of the swan-maiden legend extending from Ireland to
Siberia and back to prehistoric times. The rain-disaster is said to follow
ill-treatment of the robin. Both the robin and the wren are supposed-to
be fire-fetchers but on the continent in western Europe it is the wren rather

than the robin. In eastern Europe and Asia fire is fetched by the swallow
and these birds were used medicinally in China and England. The
chapter " Songbirds and Toads " comprises traditions concerning the
nightingale, yellowhammer, lark, stonechat and wheatear, and the toad
is associated with some of these birds in various legends. The harbinger
of spring is generally considered to be the cuckoo though it shares with
the swallow this prestige. Cuckoo folklore moreover, is found over a wide
area, ranging from Europe to Asia and there are various rhymes in which
it figures. W inged souls and bird fish comprise the last two chapters of
this interesting compilation of the folklore of birds with its wealth of
illustrations. There is also a bibliography and a comprehensive index.
Very appropriately the volume is dedicated to Professor W. H. Thorpe.

FURTHER EXAMPLES OF "TOOL-USING" PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998994552631579" page_id="58076453"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
Through the kindness of Miss Rosemary Low I have received four more accounts,
from separate sources, of parrots using a foot-held object to scratch themselves.
Two of the birds were Cockatoos ( Cacatua sulphured) and two African Grey Parrots
(Psittacula erithacusY One of the Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoos used "A piece
of stick, sometimes of some size, to scratch the sides and base of his head (he
is one of those unfortunate birds that has lost its plumage through the strange
affliction that seems so common to the small white cockatoos) and though he has
not much to scratch in the way of feathers the stick seems to have the right feeling
for him and he obviously enjoys his loofah."
The second Lesser Sulphur Crested " When given a piece of wood will bite it
for a few minutes then will always scratch under its wings and on its head. It will
do this for up to thirty minutes. It also likes to get a cigarette packet, or a monkey
nut in the shell, and do the same thing."
The African Grey extracts run as follows: " I heard him utter little ' clucks '
and ' aahs ' of pleasure. He hung to the vertical bars of his cage with one foot.
In the other he held half a cotton-bobbin which he was using as a back-scratcher."
The second of these Grey Parrots " Often uses a piece of twig to scratch his head
and neck. I give him twigs daily off my apple tree and after he has stripped the
bark he then goes through some antics which includes his scratching with the twig."
The question occurs as to whether this ability to " Chinese back-scratch " is an
innate, unlearned, behaviour or whether each of these birds has been self-taught?
Because so few cases have come to light I have assumed it to be learnt.
These are very sociable birds in which allopreening is particularly well-developed.
Such caressing of the feathers is obviously extremely pleasing to the bird. All five
of my reported cases (including the Bare-eyed Cockatoo in the July/August Avi-
CULtural Magazine) were kept as individually caged birds. And it may not be
unreasonable to suggest that such isolated birds might be " Psychologically
deprived " of the stimulus of another bird " going through its feathers ". Such
that a foot-held object accidentally brushing against the head might make such a
" deprived " parrot persist in this pleasant tickling of the feathers. The learning
of this trick would be encouraged by the very strong reward of such a pleasurable
feeling.
Just as interesting Miss Low's correspondents furnish two cases of parrots using
a receptacle with which they baled water from their drinking bowls. A three-year-
old Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoo was " First noticed using an Almond shell
for drinking water. She also regularly drinks from half a peanut-shell. The next
line shows the limit of the bird's reasoning for the letter goes on " if she has a
teaspoon held in her foot the right way up she can drink from it."

The \frican Grey that used half a cotton-bobbin to scratch itself was " bought
toys for his amusement. One of these was a brand-new briar pipe. . . . He

the bowl in the pot. Our parrot made this discovery whilst indulging in his
favourite habit of ' dunking hard objects.

Further to Mr. Clifford Smith's successful breeding this year of the Lesser
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, I have to report that this bird has been bred in Luton
by Mr Roy Wilson, a member of the Parrot Society and Luton Cage Bird Society
in 1968 and 1969. The events have been witnessed by several members, among
them Mr. D. Burgess of 442 Hitchin Road, Luton and myself.
Mr. Wilson of 71 Manton Drive, Luton, purchased the birds as babies imported
from Hong Kong in March 1964. They were put into an open aviary 15 ft. long,
6 ft. wide and 6 ft. high with a grass floor in which they have lived until this year
when the cock died. One end is roofed over. . .
The birds first went to nest in July 1968 and laid two eggs in a box approximately
2 ft. x 1 ft. placed about 3 ft. off the ground. One egg was dead in shell but the
other hatched in approximately 28 days. The birds were disturbed some two weeks
later and the chick was abandoned and died.
In July 1969, they nested again in the same box, laid two eggs, hatched them both
and successfully reared both/ One bit a hole through the roof netting this summer
and escaped but the other bird is still in Mr. Wilson s possession. Both birds
were considerably larger than their parents when one year old, possibly because
their development was uninterrupted and their parents fed and looked after them.
During the time when the youngsters were in the nest, the parents had access to
seed on the ground and therefore damped or sprouting, apples and home-made
bread. Photographs are available.

validity. ^ T Alkn ^ of Northwood&amp;gt; Middlesex, had two young ones hatched,
but they died after a couple of days. In 1924 three eggs were laid; one was clear
but the other two hatched in the beginning of June. The two young ones left
the nest in the first week in September and were capable of flight from the start
Both parents fed them for another month, when quite unexpectedly the male parent
attacked them, tearing one of them literally to pieces. The other was rescued only
slightly injured. It was apparently a female, as Allen advertised it as such tor sale
The several breeding notes are reasonably full and informative and one woulc
have thought this event merited the award of the Society's Medal .Such an aware
does not seem to have been made, but too much importance must not be attachec
to this as Allen was not a member of the Society at the time of his success--he wa
not elected until March 1925.

This Encylopaedia provides a major work of reference which incorporates articles by
leading aviculturists of the world. It is based on the original Dutch publication Encyclopedia
voor de Vogelliefhebber, compiled by A. Rutgers, an experienced avicuUurist, judge and
exhibitor of exotic birds. He considers that the successful maintenance of a
collection of birds in captivity depends very largely on a thorough knowledge of
their natural habitat and of their feeding and breeding habits in the wild. Leading
ornithologists and aviculturists from all parts of the world were invited to write on the
groups of birds on which they are the recognized authorities. His distinguished team of
writers includes Jean Delacour, Carl Naether, Robert L. Busenbark, Henry J. Bates
from U.S.A., Dr. E. Nieboer, Netherlands, Joseph Forshaw, Australia, and many
others.
Mr. K. A. Norris, Chairman of the British Aviculturists' Club and past President of the
Foreign Bird League of Great Britain, was one of the over-all editors of the original Dutch
publication. The appearance in three volumes of the English edition is the result of extensive
research and revision on his part, and he has contributed additional descriptions and details.
Mr. Norris, who has made a life-long study of exotic birds, has an extensive range of aviaries
and is the editor of two previous books, The Handbook of Foreign Birds in Colour I and II.
With certain exceptions, the classification followed throughout the work is that adopted
by Peters in his Check List of Birds of the World, and for orders and families not covered
by the volumes of the Check List so far published, A Classification of Recent Birds by Mayr
and Amadon has been used.
This first volume contains introductory articles including one specially commissioned by
Christine Startup, M.R.C.V.S., on Diseases. It covers 17 Orders from Struthioniformes to
Columbiformes. Over 70 species are illustrated in colour, and there are 209 black and
white photographs, with 330 line drawings.
Volume II, to be published in 1971, largely consists of the Psitticiformes (Parrot Family);
and Volume III, in preparation, contains the Passeriformes (small seed-eating birds) and
several other Orders.

Fhe breeding of the Golden Tanager is undoubtedly the most excep-
ional of the breeding results described in this article, and therefore we
eel it would be useful to give a more detailed account of this.
Golden Tanager ( Tangara arthus aurulenta)
r hree Clutches--one young reared
During 1970 our pair of Golden Tanagers, acquired from a dealer in
969, nested three times, but only the second brood was successful.
lousing
The pair was placed on arrival in an indoor aviary which is part of a
umber recently constructed in what was once the drawing-room of the
hateau. 1 his aviary is 2 m. long, 1 *8o m. wide and 3 m. high and is made
f plywood panels, but the top, and an area measuring 1*20 m. x o*8o m.
nd 0-95 m. above the ground and facing the gallery where the public
r alks, are covered with thin wire-netting. The main lighting is artificial
luorescent tubes suspended from the ceiling), but there is also a certain
mount of daylight through the frosted glass constituting the upper third
f the back which is opposite a large window of the chateau. The floor
covered with fine sand and a bare tree planted in a bed in the centre of
le aviary serves as a perching place. Some large rocks, a dead log, and
vo plants Cissus ( Vitis) antarctica about 1-30 m. high growing in pots
iaced in diametrically opposite corners make the aviary more attractive.
The Golden Tanagers share the aviary with a pair of Chinese Painted
uail (Excalfactoria ch. chinensis ), a Blue-tailed Pitta (Pitta guajana irena ),
male Rosita's Bunting (Passerina rositae), a male Purple Sugarbird
&apos;lyanerpes caeruleus), and several other Tanagers--a pair of Golden-
iped (T. r. ruficervix ), one Blue-necked (T. cyanicollis caeruleocephala ),
- le Golden-eared (T. chrysotis ), one Paradise (T. ch. chilensis), and one
. ellow-bellied (T. x. xanthogastra ).
)od
Our Tanagers are given the following diet: fruit: white sultanas
aked in water for several hours then dried and cut slightly so that birds
th a weak bill can eat them more easily; ripe apple, peeled and cut up

into very small pieces; sliced orange; a very little banana cut up very finely
and mixed with two or three times as much sponge-cake; other fruit
according to season: cherries, grapes and very ripe pear (cut up in the
same way as apple). Lean beef very finely minced and well mixed with
Purina feed for young pheasants 1 , mashed carrot, and sponge-cake.
A little hard-boiled egg and a few mealworms (we take care to crush the
head) are sprinkled over this mixture which is given in smaller quantities
than the fruit. Finely shredded lettuce is also given. In addition the
birds are always provided with feeding bottles of " nectar,' a preparation
for Humming&amp;quot; Birds and Sunbirds, which is renewed twice a day.

The Golden Tanagers first showed signs of nesting in mid-January;
they continually carried about twigs or leaves plucked from the plants in
the aviary, and the male, while displaying, often offered them to the female.
17th January. Various materials (dry grasses, moss, rootlets, small
dry leaves, feathers) were placed on the floor of the aviary, and the base
of a wooden nest-box, without a lid, and with a crude nest was firmly fixed
1 m. from the ground in the Cissus in one of the corners of the aviary nearer
the public gallery. The nesting site we chose was immediately accepted
by the female, who alone built the nest, mostly using rather coarse dry
grass and small leaves (dead or green) for the main structure. The
situation of the nest and the great tameness of both birds, particularly the
female, made it possible for us to observe the different phases of reproduc -
tion without too much difficulty.

We noted that the young are fed once only before being brooded again

February. One chick found dead outside the nest on a large stone;
it had the mark of a blow on its abdomen and its liver had burst.
9th February. The second chick appeared vigorous but an unforeseen
cut in electric power, lasting all day, caused the female to abandon it in
spite of gas-light being provided as quickly as possible.
Second Clutch (replacement clutch)
Already by 12th February the female began rebuilding her nest in
which she laid two eggs on 16th and 17th February.
4th March. After 15 days of incubation only one egg hatched, the
other egg being infertile. Again the female only cared for the chick,
the male appearing entirely uninterested.

7th and 8th March. The youngster's squawks are completely audible
when it calls for its ration of mealworms and its growth seems more rapid
than that of the first brood. The female, which at first regularly swallowed
the excreta of the young, began to throw this out at some distance from the
i nest although occasionally returning to her former practice.
9th March. We often saw her feed the chick twice before brooding it

until the next meal, though up to now she had only fed it once at a time.
10th March. In addition to mealworms she also gives a few beakfuls
of meat (prepared as already described), pear cut up and mixed with
sponge-cake, or small earthworms which she finds in the mulch of the
aviary. These, which later were added to the daily ration, are much
appreciated not only by the parent but also by all the other Tanagers.
nth March. The female now gives her young from three to six beak-
fuls at a feed and does not brood it regularly during the day, though she
continues to do this at night.
14th March. The rectrices are now clearly visible on the back of the
young bird. On average of 15 beakfuls given to it, 10 consist of meal-
worms, three earthworms, one of fruit (pear and apple), and one meat.
For the first time the male seems to show some interest in his youngster.
We saw him collect a beakful of food but he offered it to the female who
refused it. Further he often intervenes if the female has a quarrel with
another inmate of the aviary. He also helps her to chase away any birds
which come too close to the nest, and frequently perches on a plant above
it, and less often below.
15th March. Several times we saw the male with a beakful of meal-
worms and he even took them to the nest but the young bird did not open
! its beak and he went off and swallowed the food he had collected.

16th March. Only once did he succeed in feeding the young, but very
clumsily. We never saw him try again although we quite often see him
with a beakful of food.
19th March. The male was inciting the female to nest again by con-
tinuously offering her twigs.
20th March. All day long the female was carrying materials to the riest,
even placing them on top of the chick, which nevertheless she continued
to feed normally. But, for the first time she did not brood it at all during
the day. In the evening she tried to brood it, but was evidently disturbed
by its size and gave up and settled for the night on a small branch beside
the nest. The male sleeps each night about 20 centimetres above and
slightly behind the female.
21st March. The young aged 17 days, left the nest. It was well
feathered, the rectrices measuring 15 to 20 mm. long, but the ear-coverts
(blackish) were hardly marked round the ear-hole which is surrounded by
an area of bare skin. The female, still courted by the male and very
excited, devoted herself to the active rebuilding of the nest to such an
extent that we decided to put her with her youngster in a smaller cage
where we could ensure that she continued her duty in feeding it. We
noticed that she took more and more pear for the food she gave the young.
1st April. The young bird is now four weeks old; its plumage only
differs from that of the adults by the slightly duller and lighter colouring.
The dark grey of the bill and light grey of the legs are also paler.
20th April. We only decided to put the female back with the male
today. Up till now she never ceased to feed her young (though recently
she had been inclined to chase it and peck it), but at the age of seven weeks
it is perfectly able to feed itself though we cannot determine exactly since
when. It moulted in July and proved to be a female. 1

Third Clutch

<bodyText confidence="0.979228769230769" page_id="58076472"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
From the beginning of May the female began building a new nest in
the same place. This took a week till 8th May when she laid the only
egg of this third clutch. Incubation followed normally for about 10 days,
but on 19th May we several times saw the male violently pursuing the
female who was quite upset and desperately tried to hide among the plants
and rocks m the aviary. I o avoid accidents we decided to take the
aggressive male out of the aviary, but this unfortunately did not stop the
female from abandoning her egg. On examination it was found to
contain a well-developed embryo. This sudden aggressiveness of the
male towards the female has remained quite inexplicable.
1 As in most Tanagers the differentiation of sexes is not easy in this species;
the female can only be distinguished from the male by its slightly paler and duller
plumage.

Our pair of Blue Tanagers (the brightly toned white-winged sub-
species of the YV estern Amazonian region) was purchased from the same
dealer in 1969 an d was first housed in an indoor aviary of the same type
as that of the Golden Tanagers already described. In early spring 1970,
these birds, although very wild, showed signs of wishing to nest, carrying
about leaves which they plucked from the trees in the aviary. On being
moved to a large outdoor aviary, planted mostly with privet, they soon
built a nest in one of these shrubs about i'8o m. above the ground using
rather coarse dry grass. The aviary also contained several pairs of
Diamond Doves, a pair of Bar-tailed Doves ( Macropygia nuchallf three
Victoria Crowned Pigeons, a pair of Jackson's YVhydahs and an Indigo
Bunting.
On 20th May the female was incubating two eggs (very light blue with
rather large brownish blotches all over the surface) which hatched on
4th June (incubation period 15 days). The young left the nest on 21st
and 22nd June at the age ot 17 and 18 days. Their plumage resembles
that of the adults but with duller and greyer tones and without the white
bar on the wing.
Another clutch was laid very quickly on 1st and 2nd July, in the same
nest which had previously been strengthened. Two young hatched on
16th July (incubation 14 days), and left the nest 18 days later. During
the whole period of rearing the second brood the parents tolerated the
presence of the young of the first brood.
The food given was the same as that provided for the Golden Tanagers
(without nectai), but the audition of a supplement of mealworms four or
five times a day is necessary. It was observed that during the period of
rearing the young the adults hunted for insects with more eagerness than
usual.

it slope down towards the back opposite the entrance-hole. The clutch
of three eggs was deposited at the bottom of the log without any nesting
material. One chick hatched on 17th July. Its growth, and particularly
the development of feathers, was very slow and it only left the log on
20th August, at the age of 34 days.
The food provided for these birds was much the same as that given to
the Tanagers but with more meat and yolk of egg, and during the rearing
period more supplies of mealworms each day.
Superb Spreo (Spreo superbus)
Three Clutches--three young reared
In 1968 and 1969 we had several broods of Spreos in a large outdoor
aviary which was shared with a dozen of these birds and others, such as
Glossy Starlings, with the result that no young were reared. The nest,
either built in a Thuya 1-50 m. above the ground, or on the ledge of
a small window in a wall situated 2-50 m. above the ground, was a
coarse ball of dried grass, rather voluminous with a large opening at the
side giving access to the nest-cavity which was well lined with feathers.
In the spring of 1970 three Spreos were placed in a smaller but quite
spacious outdoor aviary already occupied by a trio of Ceylon Junglefowl
and a pair of Indian Tigrine Doves. A pair was promptly formed and a
nest was built in a rectangular box (40 x 25 x 25 cm.) hung horizontally
under the roof of the shelter, with a large semi-circular opening on one
of the smallest sides where the base protruded to form a platform. (We
usually give this type of nest-box to certain doves.)
Three clutches of four eggs (turquoise-blue and somewhat elongated)
successfully hatched during the summer.

One Clutch--two young reared
Our pair of Pagoda Starlings remain outside all the year round in a
large aviary occupied, especially during the summer, by many other birds.
A. pair of Scarlet Ibis, a pair of Palawan Peacock Pheasants, a Crowned
Pigeon, 20 doves of a dozen different species, two Giant and one Blue-
throated Barbet, a pair of Rosy Starlings, a Black-winged Starling, and a
dozen Glossy Starlings (Green and Purple-headed).
Early in June 1970 the Pagoda Starlings made a nest in a rectangular
nest-box (50 x 25 x 25 cm.) placed vertically under the roof of the shelter
and with a round entrance hole 6 to 7 cm. in diameter 35 cm. from the
base. The female began incubating on 8th June and four young hatched
an the 21st and 22nd (length of incubation 13-14 days). Unfortunately,
&apos;two days later two young were found dead outside the nest, undoubtedly
as a result of lack of food due to the large population of the aviary. The
two survivors left the nest at the age of 20-21 days. The food provided
for these birds was identical with that given to the Superb Spreos.
About three weeks after leaving the nest however, the two young
Starlings showed great difficulty in breathing accompanied by fits of
coughing and repeated yawning. These symptoms immediately made us
think of syngamosis, which is endemic in our pens, the occurrence in
the Starlings being explained by the fact that these birds like to forage
for food in the grass lawn in the aviary. This condition was proved by the
examination of one of the birds which had rapidly died. Several pairs of
gape-worms ( Syngamus trachea) were found in the trachea and also
pneumonic lesions, certainly caused by the migrations of their larvae.
By adding an anthelminthic (Thiabendazole) to the food, particularly to
the mealworms, whose skin had been scratched in order to increase the
adherence of the medicinal powder, a cure was effected within a fortnight.
It was noted that in the meantime the female, who was more exhausted
by her various reproductive duties than the male, also showed the same
symptoms but fortunately responded to the same treatment.

branch of a Thuya placed in the corner of the flight. A nest was quickly
built and two eggs laid, the relatively glossy shell being greyish olive-
green. But this clutch was clear and the same was the case in a second
clutch laid in November. One young hatched from a third clutch laid in
December, but unfortunately died when io days old. Examination
showed that it had advanced rickets and it was noted that its crop was full
of water. In the second half of January 1968 a fourth clutch was laid and
two young hatched on 6th February. On 12th February their larger
feathers, remiges and rectrices, were already sprouting and we decided to
take them away from their parents and try to hand-rear them. This was
achieved successfully by giving them a paste composed as follows: seeds
(millet, canary seed, hemp and shelled sunflower) soaked in tepid water;
sponge-cake; grated lettuce and carrot; banana and sultanas soaked in
water; meat, hard-boiled egg and mealworms cut up small; some poly-
vitaminated minerals; and the whole mixture finely mashed till a suffi-
ciently liquid paste is formed to be able to be given to the birds by means
of a pipette with an enlarged hole.
Unfortunately various construction works from spring 1968 to summer
1969 disturbed the life of the breeding pair, and it was necessary to place
them elsewhere. It was not till the spring of 1970 that a further clutch
was laid in a nest-box; one young hatched and this time was entirely
reared by the parents. A further later clutch was destroyed by the Blue-
headed Tanagers who tried to nest in the same box.
It appears that success in rearing is connected with the composition
of the food supplied to the breeding pair. These birds, which are given
the traditional diet for doves of a mixture of seeds, are very fond of and
benefit from the fruit, and even more the animal food (meat, egg-yolk and
mealworms), provided for the other inhabitants of the aviary.
Bare-faced Doves (Metriopelia cecilae)
Twelve Bare-faced Doves are housed all the year round in our largest
outdoor aviary, which is well planted, mostly with evergreens. They
breed mostly from the end of summer till autumn. They like to nest in
holes sometimes very deep, such as parrakeet nest-boxes, dove nest-boxes
or wooden compartments specially built for this purpose, and they prefer
those attached to a wall or under a shelter to those placed in trees.
On 12th November we were surprised to see a young bird just out of
the nest, with very light-coloured plumage. Unfortunately it was found
dead on 15th November, undoubtedly as a result of the bad weather
with violent and cold rain-storms. Its characteristics were as follows:
plumage entirely white lightly washed with rusty-buff, particularly on
the underparts, the red eye of albinos, and the bare skin round the eye
bright light yellow instead of orange yellow; bill and feet very pale pinkish-
yellow.

Fairy Blue Bird (Irena p. puella)
Partial success with the help of a pair of wild Blackbirds
During the last few years our pair of Fairy Blue Birds, which during the
summer are placed in an outdoor aviary, have laid several clutches but
I have not succeeded in rearing them.
On 7th May 1970, the female was again brooding two eggs in a nest
built in a pigeon nest-basket fixed below the roof of the shelter.
Having found a Blackbird's nest in a creeper on a wall in which the
hen bird had just begun to incubate five eggs, on 10th May we decided to
replace two of these (which we put in the nest of another pair) with the
eggs of the Fairy Blue Birds. Compared with the Blackbird's eggs those
of the Fairy Blue birds are larger, less elongated and with larger and
browner blotches, the light green almost white ground colour being hardly
visible.
We visited the nest on 25th May and found a young Fairy Blue Bird
and three young Blackbirds (the second egg was infertile). It appeared
to be three or four days old and the pin feathers already looked darker
than those of the Blackbirds which were obviously younger. We saw
it open its beak and it appeared to have a black line bordering the gape
around the mandibles. We visited the nest again on 30th May and found
the Fairy Blue Bird very lively, with large dark eyes and plumage beginning
to sprout, darker than that of the Blackbirds. We decided that the next
day it should be removed from its foster-parents to try to hand-rear it.
But alas a tragedy had occurred during the night as the whole brood had
fallen victims to a Lerot ( Eliomys quercinus ). These small rodents, a
species of Dormouse the size of a small rat, are very common in Normandy
f and destroy many nests. After searching we found the Fairy Blue Bird
half-eaten and minus the head.

By W. M. H. Williams (Harpenden, Herts., England)
Nest Boxes
Saw a 3 ft. pine log down the centre and then hollow out the inside to
an internal diameter of 6J in. to 7J in., except in the nest area where you
should increase the internal diameter to say 9 in. to allow more space for
eggs.
For Bufflehead the entry hole should be 3 in. in diameter and for Hooded
Mergansers 3J in. These figures are on the assumption that there are no
other competitors for the nest, such as Carolina ducks. If there are
competitors, then reduce the size so the Bufflehead has a hole of 2S in. in
diameter and the Hooded Merganser 3 J in. The distance between the
bottom of the entry hole (lip) and the bottom of the nest area is 15 in.
Place some 3 in. of sawdust at the bottom of the nest area. This will leave
you 12 in. to the lip of the hole. The hole should be between 18 in. and
24 in. above the level of the water. It is very desirable that the log be
placed in the water to prevent the birds injuring themselves if they fall off
the wooden ladder. To avoid water seeping up into the nest area, you can
place polythene around the base and up the log above the water level.
The birds are territorial and so space the nest boxes as much as possible
in the pond.
A ladder is required for the birds to enter the nest box. Use a plank
some 8 in. in width. Then ^ in. battens can be used for the steps which
should be about 2I in. apart. The ladder should be secured at an angle
of 45 degrees to the log using a large hinge. Obviously the ladder must be
secure and rest on either the bottom of the pond or some plank placed
across in a corner position to which the ladder can be nailed.
The sawdust to be placed in the nest box should preferably be fairly fine
sawdust and not thick wood shavings.
It is usual to have an inspection hole at the rear of the log. All that is
involved is the cutting out of a section as shown in the drawing. An
alternative to this is to have a roof for the nest box which is fixed by screws
so the lid can be easily removed.
It is desirable for the nest boxes to be placed in position by 1st March in
each year.
Eggs
It is better to let the duck lay all her eggs without disturbance. If you
are going to use an incubator, then allow the duck to sit on the eggs for,
say, 21 days. This will give an opportunity for the eggs to become settled

and there is far less risk if they are then being removed for the final eight
days in the incubator.
It should be noted that Bufflehead eggs normally take 29 days to hatch
and Hooded Mergansers 31 days.
If you are going to remove one egg a day and replace with a dummy or
bantam egg, then the storage is important. About 6o c F is a good tempera-
ture--some wheat in a box makes a good storage place as the wheat has its
own natural dampness. The egg should be marked on each side. Cover
just over half the egg in the wheat. The egg should be turned twice a day
through 180 0 . When the time comes to take all the eggs from the nest it is
advisable to remove also all the down. The duck should not be allowed
to sit more than 48 hours if you hope to get a second clutch.

The construction and dimensions of the box are shown in the diagram.
It is very important for the duckling to remain under the bantam not only
whilst it is hatching but for about 24 hours after hatching. The reason is
that the duckling must establish a "mother image" for the bantam.u
If the box is too big then the ducklings will not be close enough to the
bantam to feel her feathers, and they may try to hide in the corner of the
box. There are two possibilities for the nest in the coop, namely:
(a) Using sawdust and broken straw build a nest about 4 in. high inside
the box. It will be necessary to add more material from time to time.
It is very important to check that there are no gaps between the nest
and the sides of the box as a duckling might slip down and die from
cold, or
(b) dig out a small circle of turf--about 4 in. deep. Remove all stones
and then make a smooth nest in the hole from broken straw. Make
sure the hole is not dug in an area where water could drain into the
hole. If this type of nest is used then the nest box must be made
without a bottom--also rather than have the front opening it is
better to have a roof which will lift off.
Broody
Choose a small and reliable bantam. Spray her a week or so before
sitting with an aerosol to kill any fleas or bugs. Some dummy or bantam
eggs should be placed under the broody to make sure that she is settled.
When you are ready to place the duck eggs under the broody the first
thing is to take her off for a feed. Then let her return to the dummy
eggs--after an hour or so when sure that the broody has settled you can
then remove the dummy eggs and replace with the duck eggs.
Except when let out for feeding and exercise the broody must be left
shut up in the coop--in the dark.
Take care, when lifting the broody off the nest to put her in the run for
feeding etc. that there are no eggs caught up under her wings--avoid the

; isaster of an egg dropping onto the others from a great height. If you do
rack an egg then stick a piece of elastoplast over the crack, and put the
gg in an incubator. Initially the broody can be off the eggs for io minutes
r so--the periods can be increased as the incubation progresses to up to
o minutes during the last week. A woollen cloth should be placed over
le eggs whilst the broody is off the nest and feeding.
It is advisable to wet occasionally the nest material. During the last
o days squeeze a little warm water over the eggs from a sponge--otherwise
le shells may be so hard that the ducklings cannot get out.
Eggs which are soiled should be carefully washed in warm water before
utting under the bantam.
There is no need to turn the eggs over in the nest; the bantam will do

Hatching
Do not allow the broody out of the coop once the eggs are actually

. small can containing grain and a can of water can be placed in the coop--
t is not essential)--the cans must, however, be removed after the bantam
: as eaten and had a drink. Once the ducklings have dried the bantam can
len be let out in a run for food and exercise. Then the broody must
iturn to the nest box.
Until the ducklings are all hatched and dried it is advisable to keep some
 |ggs under the bantam. The eggs will keep her in the nest and stop her
tting too tightly on the ducklings. Two warmed up bantam eggs could
e used.
Broken shells should be removed. Do not discard unhatched eggs
[ ntil three to four days have passed and they show no sign of life--transfer
i) an incubator or another bantam.
Brooder
The bantam and ducklings are best kept inside a building for the first
w weeks. A suggested cage has a length of 3 ft., a width of 2 ft. and
height of i\ ft. The bottom should be made of \ in. wire mesh (for
le first seven days or so have a newspaper over the wire; thereafter the
} et of the duckling should have hardened). A 40 watt bulb in the corner
; desirable for heating--a bar in front of the shelf will stop the bantam
t uching the light. Have a small shelf over the bulb, as this prevents the
l icklings being burnt by it. The bantam and ducklings should be placed
[1 the brooder 24 hours after hatching out. They should stay in the
i r ooder for about 30 days. The diagram shows the partition wire--the
icklings' food should be kept in the left hand partition as the bantam
! lould not be allowed to eat the ducklings' food. The bantam should be
[ d with corn in the other half--the corn should not be left in the cage as it

replaced by a 150 watt bulb after the ducklings are a week old or if the

after the ducks have hatched. With an incubator feed them immediately
after removal from the incubator which should also be in the region of 24
to 36 hours from hatching. (The ducks are too delicate to survive the
48 hours in the incubator which many manufacturers recommend,
particularly in hot weather when the incubator temperatures may get too
high).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.763710333333333" page_id="58076483"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
(b) The ducklings should be fed four times a day at 3 to 4 hour intervals
until they can eat by themselves. This will work out at about 3 to 4 meals
per day. As a rule, it is more difficult to get Hooded Mergansers to eat
than Bufflehead.
(ii) Equipment
Shallow water dish: a small water container; a flat feeding tin; and
pipette (3 millilitres).
(iii) Food
(a) Mix some strained beef heart (as sold for infants) with water until it

has a paste-like consistency. Fill the pipette about 1 full for Bufflehead
and \ full for Hooded Mergansers. If two people are feeding the duck it
makes life easier. One of them should hold the duck in the palm of the
hand and assist the other (who is holding the pipette) to open the beak--
usually it is a combination of the end of the pipette and finger-nail. Then
squeeze the contents of the pipette down the throat--but not all at once.
The pipette need not be used once the ducks start eating the food. To
use the pipette you should hold the duckling in the palm of the hand. The
feeding with the eye pipette should continue for 14 days or until the duck-
lings eat by themselves, which is normally within a few days.
(b) The Hooded Mergansers and Bufflehead should have a half and half
mixture of Purina Dog Meal and Chick Starter Crumbs.
The Purina Dog Meal and the Chick Starter Crumbs must be ground
and then passed through a fine sieve--this is most important. Also add
some egg (yolk only for the first three days) and then a little water to make
it crumbly. Chick mash and crumbs have a lot of small husks which must
be sieved out--crumbs after they have been ground have far fewer husks
than the mash and are, therefore, better. Some ducks have no problem
eating Mash--however, experience has shown that many Hooded

Merganser and Bufflehead Chicks have died because their gizzards and
throats are blocked by the husks.
Place the mixture in a shallow pan--add a few meal worms as this will
encourage them to eat.
Once the ducklings start eating the mixture of Purina/Chick Crumbs
the meal worms should be discontinued for a day to avoid the birds
becoming too dependent on meal worms and eating nothing else. As soon
as the birds are settled down to the mixture a few meal worms should be
given every day.

chopped lettuce. A waterdrip will encourage the ducklings to eat the
weed.

washed through a fine sieve.

too wet.
N 0 ^_On 6th June 1970 I had five Bufflehead eggs in my incubator.
During the day it was obvious that three ducklings, although the eggs
were well pipped and cracked, would be unable to get out. I therefore
broke away the egg shell in several stages. Three were finally out of their
shells by the late evening. On the morning of 7th June I had to help the
fourth duckling from its shell. (The fifth duckling died in its shell.)
The 7th June was very hot and the ducklings by the evening were
unhappy. I therefore removed them from the incubator and put them in
the brooder. They then had their first forced feed of strained beef heart.
On the 8th June I gave the four ducklings forced feeds in the early
morning and then three hours later. I had some meal worms in the water
pan which they started to eat in the afternoon. In the evening I put some
wet mealworms in the Purina/Crumbs. The mealworms were eaten and a
little of the mixture. A forced feed was given late at night.
On the morning of 9th June I gave them another forced feed. The next :
meal was a mixture of sieved egg yolk and the Purina/Crumbs. I noticed ,
that they did not eat from the dish but ate the mixture which spilled on the |
newspaper on the floor of the brooder. In the evening they had their last
forced feed. They then settled down to eating the mixture.
I force fed my Hooded Mergansers for two days.

Normally the ducklings can be removed from the brooder after four
weeks--it depends on the weather. It is most essential to ensure that the
ducklings do not get soaked. The run should be covered overhead so the
rain does not wet them.
For the first few days the ducklings are in the run they should only be
allowed a very shallow pan for a minute or so. It must be easy for the
ducklings to get out of the pan--the ducklings will be waterlogged and
must be kept under observation. More ducks are lost through getting
soaked and cold than any other reason.
Each day the ducklings will get more oil from their preen glands--but
until they are about 2 months old it is essential for the ducks to get
properly dried out. Even at a month old they are not sufficiently oiled to
withstand getting soaked by rain.
A coop with an infra red light in the roof should be attached to the run so
that the ducklings keep warm at night and can be dried out if they get too
wet.

I should like to pay tribute to Chuck Pilling. He is one of the greatest
waterfowl men--it was Pilling who first bred in captivity the Bufflehead
and Hooded Mergansers whose descendants I have in England. Chuck
Pilling is also one of the kindest and most helpful of people, particularly
to the beginner. I have spent many hours with him jotting down his
words of wisdom. I thought it might be helpful for others to have the
benefit of Pilling's great experience and knowledge.
Finally my thanks to Donald Price of Kimpton whose skilled employees
built the nest boxes and coops at very short notice.

By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
As those readers who devour our magazine from cover to cover will he
aware, I have been keeping various waxbills of the genera Uraegirithus ,
Lagonosticta, Atnandava and Estvilda, since August 195^ (this written
December 1970). My early attempts to get my waxbills to eat egg food
and milk sop failed completely. In the early 1960s I had a hand-reared
Blue Tit which had been given me. This bird would eat little but sponge
cake (that is, in bulk, but it would eat minute quantities of various foods)
which I made fresh daily for it by adding two eggs to a commercial sponge
mix. This resulted in much spare spongecake, which, for a time, I
added, crumbled, to the waxbills' seed dish daily.
This was soon readily taken by some Black-capped Waxbills, Estvilda
nonnula , that I then had and, eventually, some of the other birds began
to take it also. However, as the Black-capped Waxbills did not breed
successfully and were mostly very fat when, one by one over a period,
they died, I feared there might be too much sugar in the spongecake and
ceased to use it.
I made no further serious attempts to get the waxbills to eat soft food
(although they were sometimes offered it) until early in 1966. The
main reasons then was the growing difficulty of getting supplies of meadow
ants ( Lasius spp.) that, (I hope not entirely as a result of my predation),
seem to have greatly decreased in south-eastern England and, so I gather,
elsewhere as well. Also I thought that eggs and milk would be a desirable
addition to the diet, if the birds could be induced to eat it.
I, therefore, started putting a dish of milksop and one of egg food into
the bird room each day. As many birds show suspicion and, in some cases
actual fear of any new (and some old) foods when presented in large masses, j
I also sprinkled some egg food each day over their tray of panicum millet.
I may here digress to explain that, apart from such insects as they may be
given, the waxbills get a long zinc tray (about ten inches by 30 inches) on
which panicum millet, treated with halibut oil about once a week in
summer and twice a week in winter, is spread each day on a clean folded
sheet of paper. In addition to this, Japanese millet and canary seed are
scattered on clean parts of the floor and mineralised grit, cuttlefish, both
crushed and in lumps, and crushed dried eggshell given ad lib.
After a few weeks of this regime, during which little if any of the soft
food had been consumed, I tried mild coercion. Each week and some-
times more often, after cleaning out the room, I left the birds without
food for about 30 to 45 minutes. They had, in each instance, had at least
an hour of light to feed after waking before this was done. When I put
back the water containers I put in the egg food and bread and milk,

scattered morsels of former in the (empty) millet tray and of the latter on
the clean newspaper around the dish.
The birds always flew down, expecting food. The first few times only
one or two half-heartedly pecked at egg or milksop. Within a few weeks,
however, several of the birds were eating it, although without much
enthusiasm. In all cases I only kept them without seed for half an hour
or less (usually less) after the soft foods had been put in. I should add
that when similar experiments had been tried but without first making
eggfood a milksop available daily for some weeks previously, none of the
oirds had eaten any.
Once a few of the birds started to eat soft food, the others " learnt "
. relatively soon to do so. This was not, however, a matter of sudden
earning. Often a bird would show definite interest when it saw another
vaxbill, especially one of the same species, eating egg or sop, but although
his usually led to its investigating the food, I did not see an instance in
vhich such an apparent " first try " led to immediate acceptance, as it
;ometimes does with pigeons.
For example, in early December 1969 (at which time all of my waxbills
.except the old Jameson's Firefinch were eating egg and milksop readily)
p- bought two pairs of wild-caught Blueheads and put them into the room.
3 n December 21st, I kept all the birds half an hour without food and then
&amp;gt;ut in egg and milksop as described above. The two new male Blue-
&apos; leads had evidently learned to eat egg as they did so without hesitation
&amp;gt;ut the females did not. One of the new females watched her mate
hating egg very intently, then pecked at some egg herself but at once
viped her bill as if disgusted with it. Later, however, both these females
te soft foods readily.
With Cordon-bleus, Uraeginthus bengalus, Blue-headed Waxbills,
7 . cyanocephalus and Golden-breasted Waxbills, Amandava subflava, all
he individuals seen to be among the first to start eating milksop or egg
ood were captive bred birds, although the wild-caught individuals sooner
r later followed suit. Two wild-caught hen Red-eared Waxbills (do
;iales of this species ever get imported?) are, however, by far the most
nthusiastic egg-food eaters of the lot, especially when they are laying
r about to lay. The Jameson's Firefinch was the last to be seen to eat
ach foods, holding out for over three years after the rest of his fellow-
(aptives were readily taking them. For the past seven months or so he has,
owever, taken a little egg and, rather more rarely I think, a little milksop!
Some of the Blueheads and Cordon-bleus will feed milksop and egg-food
) their young and rear them quite well on this together with whiteworms
id what few wild insects are available. I am not, of course, suggesting
Fiat this is better than giving fresh pupae and grubs of meadow ants adlib.
at it does solve problems when they are not available. Especially now
; tat even maggots cannot easily be got at all times and are, in any case,
f dually too big and tough to be suitable when the young are small.

I do not mix any biscuit or bread with the egg as its purpose is to add
some animal food to the diet of (partly) seed-eating birds. They are,
obviously, getting quite enough cereal food from their seed. I prepare it
by putting an egg in cold water, bringing it to the boil, then turning down
the gas and letting it simmer for about ten minutes. As soon as it is
cold enough to handle (but while it is still quite warm) I shell and peel it,
then force rather more than half the white and all the yolk through a clean
gauze strainer and mix it up with a fork, then loosen it to a crumbly
consistency. This is given in a round flower pot saucer (where it tends
to dry up rather than go sour as it would in a small, angled container)
placed on the ground and some is sprinkled over the millet in the tray
to encourage all the birds to eat it. The milksop is made of white bread.
Since, for convenience, I used Carnation tinned milk myself I also use
this, diluted with about the same amount of water, for the milksop. I
make it " crumbly wet " rather than the usually recommended " crumbly
moist " (a state that more easily becomes the sort of " crumbly-STICKY "
of some proprietary foods and than which nothing seems more distasteful
to most birds) and give it in a small plastic dish, rather heaped up in the
middle so that broken moats of milk form around it. I find that many of
the waxbills, probably all of them on some occasions, will often drink
this milk even though water is always available.
While on the subject of food for waxbills here is a simple and relatively
trouble-free way to breed whiteworms that entails none of the messing
about with complicated mixtures of loam and soil and leafmould and the
sheets of glass and other paraphernalia that some books recommend.
Buy one or more large plastic washing-up basins. Buy also some sphag-
num peat or one of the peat-like types of bulb fibre but the peat itself,
which can be bought from Woolworths among other places, is cheaper.
Mix it with water until it is wet but crumbly and not sopping. Fill the
basin or basins. Buy some whiteworm culture from your local tropical
fish shop.
With a large spoon, which is best kept handy on top of the peat in the
basin, scoop out one or (preferably) more hollows in the peat. Put in
each a spoonful or so of whiteworm culture (which consists of some clay
or earth with, if you are lucky, a lot of very hungry but not yet moribund
whiteworms mixed with it) and a dollop of rather wet milksop. Cover up
both whiteworms and sop with peat. If this last is not done mould will
grow on top of the milksop. Place the plastic basins under the bed in
the spare room, as I do, or in any equivalent place in a fairly cool but not
freezingly cold room.
Keep the substrate moist. After a week or more have a look and if the
milksop has largely gone, add some more. Within a month or less you
should have large numbers of whiteworms. They can be fed to the birds
by putting spoonfuls or better handfulls of peat and worms and spreading
it on a clean part of the floor. When waxbills have young and if you have

to leave them most or all of the day, you can also put in one or two low
heaps of peat and worms which will not dry out so quickly and will keep
them busy digging about in it.
Unlike mealworm cultures these whiteworm cultures seldom go wrong
and, if they do, can easily be thrown out and a new start made. Besides
the whiteworms, wild fruit flies will sometimes find these cultures and
breed in them, although tending to die out or disappear after a time.
They, or rather their grubs are, of course, a welcome addition to the
waxbills' diet. I have even once had a House Fly lay its eggs in one and
provide me with some really usefully-sized maggots. This useful
creature is not, alas, any longer a " common object " of either town or
country so there is little likelihood of being able to breed its maggots by
design. I suspect that the Bluebottle only holds its own so well
by virtue of its larvae's use, by and probable frequent escape from
the sessile predators that infest our waterways.

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
Cuckoo Doves derive their name from the fact that their plumage
suggests to some degree that of the cuckoo, with its bars and stripes.
However, they are called also Brown Doves, since their overall colouring
is in various shades of brown, usually an unobtrusive brown which serves
them well as protection against easy discovery by enemies. This brown
blends perfectly with other, more or less dark colours of their native
habitat, where Cuckoo Doves live largely in trees. Being short-legged,
they indulge in but little walking on the ground, where now and then they
seek food and drink. This fact holds true also in the aviary, where these
lovely doves perch high most of the time.
I was much interested in one observer's comments that Cuckoo Doves
are allopatric, that species and subspecies, though resident in different
countries, are yet fairly closely related, as evidenced largely by their brown
coloration and their usually long tails. These Wood Doves are found in
Australian and Oriental lands, from the Himalayan mountain regions to
Indo-China, Hainan and the Philippines, south to Australia. Among the
better known species are the Bar-tailed Cuckoo Dove, the Pink-breasted
Cuckoo Dove, the Red-headed Cuckoo Dove, the Pheasant-tailed Cuckoo
Dove, and many others, their popularity in captivity rising and falling
&apos; with the frequency and numbers of their importations, which in recent
years have been quite limited.

Doves are nevertheless handsome aviary birds: their long, slender bodies
made still longer by means of their " far-reaching " tails--the whole
lending a grace and a charm which combine to delight the appreciative
lover of this rare bit of wild life. This writer has had the pleasure oi
seeing Cuckoo Doves in his aviary on repeated occasions, the last occasion
being 5 now. In point of fact, one of his pairs has a husky youngster just
off the nest. He has been perching away from the nest now for several
days, always near his parents. At night he returns to his next-box in
the half-dark of the shelter, where one of his parents will still warm him
during the long, cold nights which we have been not enjoying now for
nearly a week. Being arboreal like his elders, the youngster has not
touched ground since his sojourn away from the nest. He is not as
slender as his parents, but rather plump, and his tail is short, only about
half the size of that of his father or mother. His overall colour is black-
brown, with but little evidence of barring.
Cuckoo Doves make very suitable aviary birds. Above all else, they
are gentle in their behaviour--no wild fluttering or flying about when I
enter their abode, only an interested look in my direction, measuring the
likelihood of a closer approach on my part. The behaviour of the sitting,
brooding bird when I came near the nest never varied: always he or she
would lift the small, pretty head up high facing me, and settle down on
egg (they lay but one) or youngster only after I was gone. The pair did
not build much of a nest, only a fragile platform of a few sticks in a very
shallow, open box, 5 ft. off the ground in the half-dark of the pen.
male and female took their turns regularly at incubating and then brooding
the youngster. These slim, long-tailed doves are graceful, swift flyers.
They are quiet bodies. I do not think they would thrive if kept with
other, perhaps aggressive species in the same enclosure. I keep mine
separately, thus avoiding all possible conflict and trouble.
Even though some authorities assert that Cuckoo Doves eat, besides
seeds, berries and other kinds of fruit, mine prefer hard grains, such as
popcorn and milo, and some large millet. At this time especially when W
have frosty davs and nights (it is early January as I type these lines), t ev
consume popcorn in generous quantities. I have offered them liv.
mealworms now and then, also diced cheese, but neither protein-ricl
food did they touch. In other words, these Cuckoo Doves are very eas;
to care for and to keep in good health. I can recommend their keepin;
to any man or woman who loves simple beauty and natural grace in bird
of this kind. And while, perhaps, they are not so-called fast breeders
they are steady, dependable breeders and reliable feeders of their offspring
What more can a foreign-dove fancier ask?

I was given this feral domestic pigeon when it was about two weeks old
and had fallen out of its nest. She (I discovered her sex later) was put
in a box on soft hay and fed on soaked maple peas twice daily until she
was weaned on to plain canary seed and wheat. At about five weeks old
she first ventured out of the box and started to fly about the shed where
she was kept. She would fly to me whenever she wished to be fed. She
began to remind me of one of the pigeons around Nelson's Column and
so I named her Trafalgar. She was a fine blue, resembling a racing
pigeon.
I left her completely free and she would always come when I whistled.
After moulting her nest feathers she started to treat me as though I was
her mate. One day I took her to work, expecting her to fly back home,
approximately half a mile as the crow flies. Instead she flew on to the
I flat roof of a malthouse chimney nearby and started to preen herself.
Twenty minutes later she was still there, so I whistled and she immediately
flew down to me and then on to the ground, where she followed me into
the house. She continued to follow everywhere I went until I left to
go home, leaving Trafalgar by the front door. About an hour later she
arrived home.
The following morning when I left for work she was on the shed roof,
but when I arrived at work she was waiting for me at the front door.
She spent the whole day following me, arriving home about an hour after
me. On Sunday when I stayed at home she stayed also. My employer
kept racing pigeons so I introduced her to them. She reacted as any
normal pigeon hen to a displaying male, and they mated.
At home I fixed up a nest-box for her and gave her some sticks and twigs.
She started to build a nest in the box and also displayed to me, taking any
twigs that I gave her to her nest. Eventually she laid her two eggs and
incubated for 19 days. During this period she did not pay her visits to
St. Clements where I worked. One egg was infertile, but the other hatched
and she reared it until it was about 10 days old, and then appeared to
expect me to carry on. Two or three days later the visits to St. Clements
 |were resumed and resulted in a second nest from which two young were
hatched which I was expected to finish rearing.
Trafalgar ignored her first chick which I gave to a friend, and I also
? ave away the other two. She had a third nest with one fertile egg, but
h his time she reared it to independence with my help and then went into
he moult. She did not nest after the moult and discontinued her visits

In io=i we imported n Apostlebirds (Struthidea cinerea). We at
that time, liked to tell our visitors that we did not want to buy the twelfth
Apostle (Judas). After a short quarantine period we put them in one
of our side-aviaries in our bird house, The Louise Hall The aviary was
provided with heavy trees and had a grass floor. They did not share
their aviary with other birds.
It took ih years before we saw some nesting activities, this was duiing
our European spring. Before and during this period the birds a
many serious fights which may have been caused by the unequal proportion
of the sexes. Within a year we had to separate six birds out of the group.
All the six birds we had to keep separate. We never managed to tell the
sexes of live Apostlebirds. .
It is now about 15 years since I started keeping notes on their breeding
and nesting activities. My observations were not always thorough and
only taken*at intervals. I was interested to find out whether more than
two birds would help one another in nesting and breeding, as they are
mown to do in the wild. . ,
Although we often use coloured bird-rings, our Apostlebirds were not
ringed. At the time of my observations we had five birds together and I
managed to recognize each one by small differences.
Although (as we later found out) we had two males and three females,
at that time only one cup-like nest was made by the birds, with mud and
clay, which we supplied them in their aviary. They used grass-blades
in the clay to strengthen it. The inside part of the nest was lined with
grass which prevented the birds' feathers and eggs from sticking to the
clay (after it had been damped by the artificial daily rain-showers which
we provide in the Louise Hall).
We noticed that they make new nests every year. We also noti
that they sometimes repair the top edges when necessary especially
before their second clutch. We observed three Apostlebirds building
one nest and we also observed four birds feeding just-hatched young ones.
We only saw two different birds brooding the four black-spotted creamy-
white eggs. Our young Apostlebirds never lived longer than four days,
although they had enough live " grass and tree plankton .

D. G. OSBORNE--BREEDING THE BLUE-WINGED SIVA 73
I&apos;
After the death of one of our female Apostlebirds we had to separate
the two remaining pairs, because they started fighting with each other.
Both pairs are still living in separate aviaries and have been in our zoo for
17 years now. They both breed every spring, although we still have not
had any success. We are now planning to give them a quiet outside
aviary which is situated outside the zoo. We&apos;have never read any article
on Apostlebirds kept in captivity, although some Australian aviculturists
must have had some experiences. We would be glad to have any informa-
tion from others concerning these birds.

Blue-winged Siva's are small babblers from the Himalaya's, and are
similai in size to a Pekin Robin, but are much slimmer with a much
longer tail, which gives them the appearance of being larger birds. The
cock and hen are alike in both appealance and colour; breast and belly
being light cream, back and upper wing light creamy brown, the main
wing feather being cobalt blue with black and white streaks running down
! the length, this also applies to the tail which also has a white edge at the
end. 1 he crown is also streaked with cobalt blue and light cream. The
bill and legs are grey, with a few whiskery hairs at the base of the bill.
The Siva s are very active birds, perpetually on the move, and become
; very friendly, learning to take meal-worms from the hand. Their diet
is similar to that of Pekin Robin, but with plenty of live food. They have
a good insectile mixture, fruit, such as sweet apple and pear, maggots and
a little mealworm. 1 it-bits offered once or twice a week include cheese,
brown bread soaked in honey water, berries, soaked dates and various fats!
! My birds have never taken seed as far as I have noticed.
j |* ^ rst purchased a single bird in December 1968, and asked the dealer,
Mr. Clark of White Hart Bird Farm, to let me know immediately any
 |others arrived. It was not long after that I collected another from him.
Because of the difficulty in sexing these birds, as they are so identical to
each other m all respects, I thought that only by observing their behaviour
I would I be able to tell. I kept the birds separate but adjacent to each
j ot ^ er - I felt I must have two of the same sex as no reaction was shown
, until I put them together, when fighting immediately commenced, and
was very serious, which meant I had to part them.
Mr. Clark had said he would change them if they were the same sex,
I and this he did. This time, when separated but within sight of each

other, one of the birds let out a deep-throated short song, similar in tone
to a Pekin Robin, but quite distinguishable. This did not last long so I
put them together, and for the first five minutes or so they kept their
distance, with occasional short spells of fighting, but nothing very serious;
then suddenly they sidled up to each other and sat very close together.
After that they were completely compatible. I thought this must be a
pair, which later proved correct.
In 1970 I put the pair in a planted outside aviary with access to a small
indoor birdroom. The outside flight is 8 ft. 6 in. x 8 ft. o in. x 6 ft. 6 in.
high and is planted with various shrubs, i.e. bamboo, forsythia, black-
currant, and variegated grass. There is a brick wall at the back on which
I hang branches giving a thick cover. I have a length of P.V.C. sheeting
over this to provide a shelter for the birds. The inside birdroom is only
6 ft. o in. x 2 ft. bin. x 4 ft. o in. high, standing on legs to allow for
storage under. This birdroom is then incorporated inside a brick and
cedarwood outbuilding.
I noticed at various times through the summer one bird carrying dried
grass in its bill and displaying and calling to the other, which I now
assumed was the hen. When displaying, they get very close together
with their heads only moving away from each other as if they are too close
to see each other. They then move up and down doing a throaty chatter.
I soon noticed them building a neat cup-shaped nest in a large wicker
basket placed in the birdroom; put there originally for the smaller fincnes.
The nest was made of dried grasses and string fibres. *1 nese I had made
by cutting up the string into short lengths and looked similar to horsehair.
The first egg was laid on the floor inside the birdroom, then later
another two eggs were laid in the nest, but the birds showed no sign of
sitting on them and I removed the eggs from the nest. Not long after
that another three eggs were laid, this time in the nest, but, unfortunately, I
after ten days of sitting by the hen she deserted the nest for no apparent
reason. All three eggs were fertile. At this stage, I thought any chance
to breed had now gone, but the hen had other ideas and again laid three
eggs in the same nest. The eggs are about the same size as a linnet or
bullfinch egg; pale blue in colour and mottled with reddish-brown
blotches.
This time the hen sat the full fourteen days from 12th August to 25th
August, when three young hatched out. The hen immediately started
feeding the youngsters with soft mealworms that were changing their skins,
flies and blowfly pupae. The cock took no part whatsoever and in fact
was more of a nuisance by trying each evening to encourage the hen off
the chicks and to roost outside with him. On a couple of occasions he
succeeded, but I managed to chase the hen back into the birdroom and
close the hatch for the evening. Luckily, she would then settle down
with the chicks, keeping them warm, and it was not until I saw that the .
chicks were feathered, after about twelve days, that I allowed her to stay

out with the cock, fortunately, she was a good hen and continued her
duties each day, feeding the ever-growing over-hungry youngsters.
After about a week, one of the young just disappeared. I assumed it
had died and had been removed from the nest, probably due to the fact
that the hen couldn t keep up the enormous effort needed to sustain
three very hungry babies with mainly live food.
The remaining two youngsters quickly feathered up and left the nest
on the 9th Septembei, sixteen days after hatching. I tried to provide as
much extra live food as possible in addition to the normal supply of
soft mealworms, blowfly maggots and pupae. Although most of these
were always available, together with bread soaked in milk, the hen seemed
to &apos;vary the diet herself by taking a little of each at various times. I was
also able to supply between two and four medium-sized stick insects per
day. These I had previously bred from eggs for my summer season.
The hen was also supplied with a fairly large quantity of flies each day,
together with earwigs which I caught. The flies I caught with a net!
The earwigs I obtained at night when they were feeding on fruit on the
aviary wire netting.
Although for the first few days the hen only fed pupae and live food,
including earwigs, she later started to feed to the young the bread soaked
 |m ilk. I observed that the hen removed all wings of flying insects,
and also the legs off stick insects and the pincers out of earwigs.
All in all, I consider it was a combined effort between myself and the
hen to rear her brood; as the cock bird took no part whatsoever, except to
steal the extra food provided for his family.
The hen continued to feed the two young birds for approximately two
weeks after leaving the nest. This may be a longer period than in the
&apos; wild, but I wouldn't risk parting them until I was absolutely sure the
chicks would feed themselves properly.
The cock was aggressive to the young birds after approximately a
week of leaving the nest, so to avoid any tragedies I separated the cock
parent bird from them and left the hen to feed the young.
When first coming out of the nest, the young were identical in colour
to their parents, the only difference being that they had a short stubby tail
which seems to grow rapidly. With birds in which the sexes are similar
; I always put a split plastic ring with a different colour on each bird, so
i that I can be sure which is the cock and which is the hen.
P These youngsters are now thriving in an unheated birdroom after
taking rather a long time to get through their first moult. The parents
! are ke pt separate from the young in an outside flight. The only time I
fhave used heat for these birds was when I first purchased them (the
i parents) to acclimatize them through the first winter, since then both the
parents and young have been kept with no heat whatsoever, in fact, I find
i these birds, once acclimatized are very hardy and the parent birds have
[ keen outside constantly throughout this winter.

The Berlin Zoo has a long tradition in keeping bustards. For this
reason this bird family always was well represented here. At the moment
our collection consists of Great Bustards (Otis t. tarda ), a species which
still occurs in the surroundings of Berlin and which was bred for the
first time in captivity in 1964* Kori Bustards (Ardeotis kori ), Black
Korhaan (Afrotis afra afroides) and Senegal Bustards (Eupedotis
senegalensis). The pair of Senegal Bustards was purchased from East
Africa in 1967. In 1970 the hen laid eggs which were put into the
incubator. After an incubation period of 22 days three young hatched:
on 19th July, 10th August and 30th September. Mrs. Elisabeth Johst,
head keeper of our bird house, hand-reared them with patience and skill.
Whereas one of the young bustards died, the two others grew up very
well. We do not know whether this species has been bred before
elsewhere, but we suppose this to be the first successful breeding result.
Another satisfactory event was in 1970, the breeding of an Andean
Condor ( Vultur gryphus ) which has reached by now the size of its parents.
The young bird remained only a few days in parental care and was then
taken away to be hand-reared. We were forced to do this because in
1967 and 1968 we had lost two young Condors because the adults overfed
them with stones and feathers and other indigestible things. A third
one, which hatched in 1969, strangled itself when it was six months
old by the cable of an infra-red lamp. The sex ratio was two males : two
females, the incubation period 60 to 61 days.

The Kansas City Zoological Gardens has recently recorded a remarkable
breeding success, the White-tailed Sea Eagle Haliaetus albicilla. An j
egg was laid on yth--8th March, 1969, and another on 11th--12th Alarch.
The female commenced incubating after laying the first egg. On 28th
March it was discovered that one of the eggs had disappeared. The other,
however, hatched on 5 th April. The young one flourished and left the
nest on 30th June. It was fully capable of flight by 20th July, by which
time it was approximately the size of the female.

also of the Parson Finch--White-rumped and Black-rumped. Having 1
reached the third generation he thinks he has solved the problem. He is 1
also experimenting in crossing Yellow-rumped and Chestnut-breasted j
Mannikins. Nine hybrids have been bred, also two hybrids inter se.
The intention is to mate the F--1 hybrid cocks back to Yellow-rumped
hens. There is some variation in the colour of the F-i hybrids, but the \
Chestnut-breasted colour appears to be in some degree dominant, so
there is little reason for back-crossing to the Chestnut-breasted. The I
birds are moulting rather slowly, especially the hybrids.

A FIELD GUIDE TO THE BIRDS OF SOUTHERN AFRICA.
By O. P. M. Prozesky. Illustrated by Dick Findley. Collins:
London. #12*50.
South Africa has had a good coverage with books on bird identification.
^ ^&amp;quot;he most complete is IVIackworth-Praed and Grant's two thick volumes
of the Handbook to the Birds of the Southern Third of Africa , giving a
concise text for not only each species but also the subspecies, and fully
illustrated, although the birds are small at times. Maclaren and Liver-
sidge s revision of Robert s Birds of South Africa gives a single volume of
more manageable size in which all species are illustrated in colour. It
; has, however, the disadvantage that the appearance of the birds is not
I described in the text and that the plates were prepared by a draughtsman
using skins and mounted birds and relatively unfamiliar with them in the
field. Collins have now produced a field guide of the larger pocket size,
intended as a handy work for the field, smaller and cheaper than the other
books.
Of the 900 or so species involved 411 are illustrated, 327 of these in
l colour. Species entries are in three categories. The commoner birds

<bodyText confidence="0.9501035" page_id="58076503"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
! species, with a briefer text discussing only identification with reference
! 0 those already depicted. Finally a number of rarer species are merely
isted by common and Latin names with no details. Since the relevant
I &amp;gt;pecies numbers of Robert's book are given, one is presumably expected
o consult this for rarer birds. It is useful to know what other species
night be present, but users may find it annoying to have no indication
)f how they might be recognized.
\0x25A0 Ihe plates do give an indication of the colour and appearance of the
)irds, but the artist has a number of consistent faults. Eyes are too large,
kulls too narrow and bills too large; and a number of birds, such as
-loopoe and plovers, follow too closely the inaccuracy of the Robert's
"lates, while others are worse.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997358921052631" page_id="58076504"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
Schauensee. Wynnewood Pa., U.S.A.: Livingston Publishing
Company, 1970. Price $20.
For most aviculturists and ornithologists alike, South America has been
a dark continent with an avifauna that was tantalisingly and incompletely
described in works that dealt with some peripheral part of it; the entire
picture never fully being revealed. Recent books had begun to deal with
larger areas but it was not until de Schauensee published his Species of
Birds of South America in 1966 that we finally had a distributional list
that gave an overall and up-to-date picture of the number and variety of
species present on that continent. He has followed this up with the
present work, and we now have in a single volume a complete, if somewhat
abbreviated, guide to South American birds which enables us to review&apos;
all the species; and not to be left wondering whether perhaps there was
one that wasn't included in the work which we consulted. T here are
2,926 species involved and the fact that 15 new species have been described
in the last decade is an indication of how little has been known of this part
of the world.
To cope w r ith this number of species in some 430 pages requires careful
use of space, and the w T ork is a masterpiece of compression. The intro-
duction lists the typical habitats and discusses the major types of distribu-
tion. Each family is introduced by a paragraph of general characters, and
a brief key to aid identification. Species are dealt with in double columns,
with common and latin names, the latter with asterisks to indicate where
subspecies occur. A statement of overall length is followed by a very
abbreviated plumage description, confining itself to main diagnostic j]
characters and often comparative, but at times contriving to indicate ij
well-marked subspecific variation. Distribution is given, and for most .1
species a brief indication of habitat. Four endpaper maps help the usen|
to understand the distributional information.
Compressed as it may be, I feel that the usefulness of the single volume |
outweighs the brevity of the text. I wish, however, that I could feel more
enthusiastic about the plates; 50 of them, with 31 in colour. Admittedly, :;
as the author points out, 676 species are shown, including at least oneij
member of every family, and representatives of 680 genera. This has been
achieved by reusing the 20 plates by E. L. Poole from the Birds of Columbia , &lt;
and adding a further 30 by J. R. Quinn. Both artists have trouble at
times with head and bill shape and expression, and Quinn has a habit of
painting his birds with partly-closed eyes; and in spite of the limit on

numbers, apparent lack of liaison has resulted in some species being illus-
trated twice. Quinn s attempts to use perspective to cope with size
differences are relatively unsuccessful. The 22 text drawings by G. M.
Sutton are rather more natural in appearance. However, in spite of
faults and inadequacies this probably represents the biggest assemblage of
South American birds to be found in illustrations of this kind.
I feel sure that this is a book which a growing number of aviculturists
interested in South American birds have been waiting for; and one which is
likely to remain a standard work of reference for some years to come.
Even where it does not provide a final answer it does provide the initial
solid basis from which the further search for information can proceed.

FANCY PIGEONS. By W. Watmough. London: Cassell, 1070.
Price 1 os. or 5op.
Some fancy pigeons, such as Archangels and Clean-legged Ices, are
creatures, (or ought one to say human artifacts?) of great beauty; others,
j such as Fantails, Carriers, Chinese Owls and Russian Trumpeters, are
distorted and hideous monsters. So far as I am aware, no pigeon
fanciers, anywhere, have ever thought it worthwhile to perpetuate the
original type in a domestic state.
Whether one is attracted or repelled by fancy pigeons, this very well-
illustrated booklet, which gives excellent photographs of (unless I have
miscounted) 23 different breeds, is well worth its trifling price. A useful
introduction to the subject for the aspiring fancy pigeon breeder and
shower; good ammunition for those who are opposed to the fancier and
all his arts and crafts. Among these, when preparing his productions
for their debut in the show pen, are " removing certain feathers which
form the marking pattern ", improving (sic) " the wattle of most breeds
by the use of fine sandpaper to make it smooth " or cutting off the end of
overgrown upper mandibles " to allow the mandibles to fit close together."
Throughout, the emphasis, quite justifiably in view of the title, is on
breeding fancy pigeons for show. There is a short final chapter on keeping
pigeons in garden dovecotes. Here the remarks on settling pigeons to a
new home are so brief as to be of little help to a complete novice. He is
told to keep his pigeons in for four or five days and then allow them out
for only a few hours at a time for several days " as " this method prevents
\ t * iem living home ". He is not, however, told how to get them back
ifter the few hours leave or how, given luck, he can prevent them leaving
nome during their outing.

NEWCASTLE DISEASE IN FRESHLY IMPORTED LARGE PARROTS

The following is an abstract of a paper by W. Liithgen and G. Wachendorfe
which appeared in the Deutsche tierarztliche Wochenschrift, August 1970.
Disease occurred this summer in three West German quarantine stations tor
parrots. In the first instance 250 out of 285 Amazon parrots died within a few
days of arrival; in the second, all of 137 birds of three separate shipments (Macaws
and Amazon and Gray parrots) died within a fortnight. In the third instance
co per cent of a mixed batch of Amazons and a few Macaws died within a week.
Tests for ornithosis and for the presence of specific bacterial pathogens proved
negative but the virus of Newcastle disease was identified. The clinical symptoms
observed were related to disturbances in the central nervous system which resulted
in head contortions, tremors in the head and body and paralysis. The pupil was
sometimes enlarged and breathing was difficult. Birds sent for po&amp;gt;st-mortem
examination were in average to good bodily condition. Typical findings were
cerebral and liver haemorrhages and enlargement of the spleen. It is clear that, j
to obtain a proper diagnosis, isolation of the virus is essential.
A member comments: " It has been known for a long time that parrots can be
affected by the virus of Newcastle disease (better known for its effect on domestic
poultry) and there have been several cases in Britain during past years. The
particular interest of the present report lies in the extreme virulence of the strain
involved--the speed with which the birds died and the very heavy rate of mortality.
Strains vary considerably in virulence." . . ^ , ,
" The authors comment on the dangers to the poultry industry in the federal
Republic, which has in general been free from Newcastle disease for some years.
The report is an interim one and there is no information on whether the disease
was likely to have been contracted from contact with poultry while the birds were
being assembled prior to shipment or whether latent infection was activated by
stresses to which the birds were subjected at this time.
"Unlike ornithosis, Newcastle disease, while it may be contracted by them,!
is not regarded as dangerous in humans, but it is of course extremely serious in
domestic poultry. There might well be repercussions if such an active virus
were shown to have been introduced into Britain in such a way. Complete
avoidance of danger presumably would depend on radical changes in the conditions!
under which birds are collected and imported. Aviculturists can limit the
possibility of damage resulting from the purchase of freshly imported infected
birds by careful quarantine and by scrupulous hygiene, particularly of course i
with regard to the disposal of waste food and cage sweepings.

In the November-December 1970 issue of Avicultural Magazine C. J. 01
Harrison explains his insertion of the name " White-capped Parrot for Pionvi 1
seneloides of South America, because that name is used by R. M. de Schauensee]
in his various books on distribution and identification of the birds of that continent
As Mr. Harrison points out, the names adopted by de Schauensee, the first: rea
effort to standardize bird species names for South America, have been widely I
followed in other works. He mentions that there is a Central American parrot]
P. senilis , which has also borne that name. However, in the numerous curreni
ornithological works published in America, from and including Ridgway s 1910
parrot volume down to the recent 1970 work by H. Land, " Birds of Guatemala
P. senilis is always designated " White-crowned Parrot " Hence there should b(
no confusion--unless aviculturists persist in calling them both by the same name

" Red-rumped Parrakeet " become the "Red-backed Parrot" is descriptively
wrong. It has a green back and red rump. Likewise Massena s Parrot has a grey
head, which is its alternative and perhaps better name, and certainly not a white one.
It is perplexing to me as to why " Caique ", " Conure and Amazon ? have
not been retained by de Schauensee, and the other authors, yet Parrotlet and
" Macaw 5 ' are kept. Some of the fresh names, in my opinion, seem to be conjured
up by a poet in " Basic-English " " Red-fan Parrot " instead of the very long-
standing Hawk-headed Parrot--which is after all its Latin name in translation.
" Blue-bellied Parrot " replaces " Purple-bellied "--republican tendencies? Some-
times, by way of change, the simple becomes inflated to the gradiloquent as when
the humble " Blue-fronted Amazon " becomes the " Turquoise-fronted Parrot .
The " old " names, though often taken directly from the original taxonomic ones,
keep stability. Amazon Parrots spent many years as Chrysotis until Peters restored
them to Amazona. Eclectus has remained the common name for that bizarrely
sexually dimorphic parrot. Laterly Eclectus has been restored as the generic name.
Perhaps the previously used Lorius can now be " given back to the Lories or the
genus Domicella ? r . , . ,
Sometimes I am left wondering just how well people know some of the birds
that are described in their books. Mr. A. A. Prestwich has lately published a list
of accepted English names of the parrots, it would seem a terrible waste of his
undoubted erudition if his list of well-tried names is to be lapsed in favour ol fresh,
original ones.

This Encylopaedia provides a major work of reference which incorporates articles by
leading aviculturists of the world. It is based on the original Dutch publication Encyclopedic
voor de Vogelliefhebber, compiled by A. Rutgers, an experienced aviculturist, |udge and
exhibitor of exotic birds. He considers that the successful maintenance of a
collection of birds in captivity depends very largely on a thorough knowledge of
their natural habitat and of their feeding and breeding habits in the wild. Leading
ornithologists and aviculturists from all parts of the world were invited to write on the
groups of birds on which they are the recognized authorities. His distinguished team of
writers includes Jean Delacour, Carl Naether, Robert L. Busenbark, Henry J. Bates
from U.S.A., Dr. E. Nieboer, Netherlands, Joseph Forshaw, Australia, and many
others.
Mr. K. A. Norris, Chairman of the British Aviculturists* Club and past President of the
Foreign Bird League of Great Britain, was one of the over-all editors of the original Dutch
publication. The appearance in three volumes of the English edition is the result of extensive
research and revision on his part, and he has contributed additional descriptions and details.
Mr. Norris, who has made a life-long study of exotic birds, has an extensive range of aviaries
and is the editor of two previous books, The Handbook of Foreign Birds in Colour I and II.
With certain exceptions, the classification followed throughout the work is that adopted
by Peters in his Check List of Birds of the World, and for orders and families not covered
by the volumes of the Check List so far published, A Classification of Recent Birds by Mayr
and Amadon has been used.
This first volume contains introductory articles including one specially commissioned by
Christine Startup, M.R.C.V.S., on Diseases. It covers 17 Orders from Struthioniformes to
Columbiformes. Over 70 species are illustrated in colour, and there are 209 black and
white photographs, with 330 line drawings.
Volume II, to be published in 1971, largely consists of the Psitticiformes (Parrot Family);
and Volume III, in preparation, contains the Passeriformes (small seed-eating birds) and
several other Orders.

Jueer little animals which are reminiscent of both ape and squirrel have
livestigated the camp area and probably the sleepers too; but now they

|s plaintive call, " Tu-ee-chi, tu-ee-chi, tu-ee-chi ".
One voice is however awaited with some expectancy by anyone who

It nay appreciation of music depends to a great extent upon the associa-

of an apparent urgency as they build up towards the full-voiced
culmination. , r , .
He sings at any time of day and is heard in almost any place, for he is
a common garden bird as well as a dweller in the remote bush country
far from any human habitation. He is equally at home in the coo
highlands and in the hot, dusty country at lower altitudes.
The nest is a structure of roots, grass, dead leaves and other natural
debris placed rather untidily in a cavity amongst the stems of creepers
or in a hole in an ivy-covered bank, or on top of a dead stump amongst
the natural mosses and ferns that grow in such a place. The eggs art
usually said to be two or three in number, but I have found four youn^
in two nests that I knew. The eggs are bluish with such a heavy spattering
of brown markings that the ground colour is not very evident.
As far as I am aware the food of this bird is that of a typical insectivorous
and fruit-eating small thrush. All sorts of spiders except the big hairj
ones which everyone (other than baboons) avoids, caterpillars, grass-
hoppers, flies and termites are taken along with quantities of berries, hg:
and other fruit. Most of this is collected down amongst the lowe
foliage or on the ground. It is a bird which prefers good cover am
seldom comes far into the open; nor have I seen it in the higher canop;
of a tree. For this reason its presence is more often known from its song
than from its being actually seen by a casual eye.
It is like most thrushes an easy bird to rear if taken from the nest
and like most birds hand-reared becomes beautifully tame. The youn;
are typical of the thrush family with predominantly brown plumag
spotted with buff and lighter brown. &amp;gt;
I have never known an example of this species in any Buropea
aviculturist's collection although I cannot doubt they have from time t
time been imported. But many a schoolboy in Africa has reared an
kept a nestful, later to release them into the garden when the holiday
come to an end. It must be a popular bird in an aviary collectioi
provided a watch is kept to forestall any fighting; for like most thrus e
this bird can be very quarrelsome with other birds, particularly otm
members of its family the Turdidae. J
Ideally the aviary should be planted with bushes and this can t
tiresome to some who dislike the destruction of growing plants inaviaru
by the acidity of birds' droppings. My own way out of this difhcu
is to have my bushes of whatever sort in large pots which can be move
in and out when necessary and so renewed. I like a good carpet &lt;
leaf-mould, peat and sand which encourages the birds to turn it ov&lt;
constantly in their search for insect life and so keep themselves occupies
A bare aviary seems to me to house bored birds, and my feeling is *
as they are my guests rather than my prisoners I do well to make the
accommodation as natural to them as I can.
There is a cult in aviculture today which preaches that comprehensr

foods, by which I mean foods that contain all the vitamins, trace elements
etc., must be the right food to give our birds. It is in my submission a
mistaken view. Prisoners in gaol are treated like that and I suppose they
stay, or are kept healthy, but our birds have not done dreadful things to
deserve a like incarceration, and the one thing they seriously are deprived
of in these comprehensive foods is the fun andwork in finding or pulling
the food to pieces. Where it is natural for birds to scratch around and
turn things over in their search for food we do them no good service in
providing stuff they only have to pick up and swallow.

BREEDING THE RED-BILLED WEAVER
{Quelea quelea lathami )

Such a well-known bird needs no description, suffice to say that our
sub-species in Rhodesia, Quelea quelea lathami, is a little larger and paler
than its West African counterpart.
The Red-billed Weavers come to civilization to feed during the months
of April to November, when they all depart for their breeding grounds in
the Lowveldt. It was during this period that my birds were trapped and
placed in an aviary 21 ft. x 18 ft. x 6 ft. with various other Weavers and
Widows for companions. Two pairs only of the Red-bills were in this
collection.
About August 1970 one male was seen weaving a nest in a bush in the
covered shelter. Strips of palm leaf were used, this having been placed
in the aviary for the Village Weavers to use for building. A covering
porch over the entrance made from pampas grass was added on com-
pletion of the nest, the adult birds entering from beneath this.
Mating was obseived with much wing vibrating from both male and
female. Three pale blue unspotted eggs were laid. When the female
left the nest during incubation, the male would mount guard and woe
betide any bird that ventured too near as it was speedily driven off.
From observation they are not polygamous and there is a very definite pair
Dond. The incubation period was 12 days, two chicks hatching, one
disappearing after five days. The survivor was reared mainly on white ants
&apos;egurgitated by both parents, but as the youngster grew, seed was also fed.
The young Red-bill left the nest at approximately 14 days and, although
/er y small, was a strong flier; it resembled the female but had a horn-
floured bill. Females of this species have three bill colour changes;
10m when young, wine when adult, changing to yellow when in breeding
f ndition, and back again to wine in the off season.
Food provided was the usual mixed millets with the addition of the
\hite ants given daily, and the youngster is now completely self-reliant.

D. GOODWIN--ANTING BY CORDON-BLEUS
In conclusion, I would like to add that I have had many Red-bills over
the last 40 years, both in Britain and Rhodesia, but have never even had
eggs before this, although as fanciers who have kept this bird know, they
are industrious nest builders.

The " anting " of many passerine birds is, I imagine, familiar to
almost all aviculturists and to most people interested in birds. By the
term is understood the bird's application of ants to the underside of the
wing quills, and sometimes to other parts of the plumage. In some cases
other pungent objects, such as acid fruits, cigarette ends and hot soapsuds,
may be used, at least by some individuals. Some time ago (Goodwin
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.874672" page_id="58076526"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
I 955 ) I wrote an article on anting in our magazine, and Simmons (see

<bodyText confidence="0.997527565217391" page_id="58076526"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
References) has more recently written very comprehensively on it.
Although the waxbills of the genus Amandava regularly ant when
given the opportunity (Goodwin i960), there do not appear to be any
records of the cordon-bleus or blue waxbills anting. My own blue
waxbills do not ant, with ants, although they eat ant pupae, and the
winged male and female ants eagerly and repeatedly see the Avadavats
and Golden-breasted Waxbills, kept with them, anting. I have, however,
seen blue waxbills of two species, the Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu,
Uraeginthus bengalus *, and the Blue-headed Waxbill or Blue-headed
Cordon-blue, U. cyanocephalus , show anting movements in response to
centipedes and millipedes, and also, one bird only, in another situation.
I give the observed instances in chronological order from my notebooks.
There were, I regret to confess, a few early instances, involving millipedes&apos;, I
Cylindroiulus spp., which got lost before the rough notes jotted down were
transferred to the species' notebooks.
24 th April 1967
I had put into the room some " top spit " earth from the garden in
which there were a few very thin, slender, bright brownish-yellow
centipedes ( Geophilus spp.). These are taken by Blue Waxbills, especially
when they are feeding young. They are seized, thrown down, picked up
again, beaten on the ground or perch and so on for some moments before

<bodyText confidence="0.974865868421053" page_id="58076528"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
A millipede was put in. A Bluehead male, White Left (a wild-caught
bird that had been purchased the previous January and had shown no
signs of anting before on being presented with millipedes), came down,
looked at it from about 3 ft. or less away and performed anting movements.
He did not touch or go nearer to it and gave no further reaction. However,
on 15th June, when ants and pupae were put in, I saw what appeared tc
be very brief and low intensity anting movements from this Bluehead and
also from a male Cordon-bleu whose ring I could not see.
13 th August 1970
Bluehead female, Green Right, approached two young Cordon-bleus
that had fledged the previous day. She brought up food into the uppei
part of the gullet as she came near to them, made as if to feed one of tht
young bengalus , which were now begging to her, but, apparently at th(
very moment that their mouths made contact, she drew sharply back and
all in one movement, anted under her left wing. She repeated this thre&lt;
times and then flew off without having given any food to the young.
One of these young Cordon-bleus died. This female Bluehead wa:
not seen to show further interest in the survivor. The latter was
however, adopted by two male Blueheads and kept so well supplied b;
them that it was not very demonstrative, and even its own parents seeme(
disenchanted with it (" Thinks more of these odd people who've takei
him up, and after all we've done for him! ") and seldom fed it.
3 rd September 1970
Two of three young Blueheads, that had fledged on 28th, seemed ver
hungry. I saw them beg several times to their mother but she did no
feed them.
Then the female Green Right came to them. They begged intense!
to her. She kept bringing up food into the upper part of her gullet as i
she wished to feed them but seemed afraid of coming too close. The:
she came closer to them. Again and again, at least ten times withi
half as many minutes, she made regurgitating movements to bring food int
the upper part of the gullet, then put her bill down to a begging youn
bird's mouth, only to flinch back as if stung and make an anting movemer
under her left wing, as she had before with the young Cordon-bleus
The same evening, however, I saw her feed one of these youngsters in
perfectly typical manner and she had, I think, previously fed the other
as they were obviously sated and did not beg to her. They may, howevei
have been fed by their father who was still caring for them.

I watched for some time. The three young Blueheads were now being
cared for by their father and a male Avadavat also. They had also begun
to eat both seeds and insects for themselves though still begging and
accepting food readily. Green Right fed them several times normally,
but at other times she repeated her " flinching and anting at the last
minute instead ", as described above. Sometimes this seemed to be
caused by the male Avadavat interposing himself between her and the
young one she wished to feed, so that she appeared to be unable quite to
reach it over him, but at other times nothing overtly prevented her and
she would flinch back as or just before she made mouth-to-mouth contact.
In all these cases only a single anting movement was made and always
under the left wing.

Although anting movements were (sometimes) elicited by centipedes
or millipedes, the blue waxbills did not actually hold them in their bills
when anting. Whether this is because they were anting only at low|
intensity (which is very likely in view of the few occasions on which this
behaviour w r as seen) or because these species do not normally ant with
anything in the bill remains to be discovered. Avadavats and Golden-
breasted Waxbills, Amandava amandava and A. subflava, which ant
regularly and enthusiastically (Goodwin i960), do not, so far as I have
seen, ever hold an ant in the bill when so doing. On the other hand the
only estrildine that, so far as I know, has been recorded anting with
millipedes, the Red-headed Blue-bill, Spermophaga ruficapilla , always
seized the millipede by or near the head and held it while anting (Kunkel
J9 6 7)-
Like my blue waxbills, Dr. Peter Kunkel's Blue-bills never anted with
ants. The blue-bills were, however, always induced to ant when
presented with a millipede. Possibly this difference was because the
blue-bills, which were in captivity in their native land, were presented
with the " right " species of millipede, which was almost certainly not
the case with my birds.
The use of the typical anting movement, always under the same wing,
by the female Bluehead, Green Right, under the circumstances described
above is puzzling. It may represent nothing moie than the anting
movement, which is also essentially a preening movement, being used as
a " displacement movement ", but the most impressive thing to the
watcher was the appearance of a sudden uncontrollable flinching away
by the bird just as she was about to make mouth contact. It is difficult
to think why the gaping mouths of the young should elicit a response
otherwise elicited by pungent invertebrates. More especially as she later
fed them in a normal manner and, indeed, sometimes both fed them and
" flinched away and anted " within a short space of time.

By G. A. Smith (Peterborough, Northants, England)
The majority of land-vertebrates, excepting birds and those that graze
use the forelimbs to assist them when feeding. To take two examples: a
toad when it eats a worm stuffs the wriggling ends into its mouth with its.
hands; and a tortoise tackling a crust of bread gets hold with its jaws and
pulls off a mouthful by breaking away the remainder with a thrust of its
arms. . Birds--because the forelegs have become wings--are handicapped
when it comes to dealing with bulky-sized foods. A Blackbird with a
worm, or a Sparrow with bread, is a far more laborious feeder than the
toad or tortoise. Animals are especially vulnerable to predation when
reeding because their attention is distracted and the increased movement
involved makes them conspicuous. Anything that will reduce time so
'Pent must be of benefit. The gape and gullet can be enlarged--by
latural selection--to enable large, smoothly stream-lined foods such as
ish and thick-skinned fruits to be engulfed whole. Yet meat other than
ish irregularly shaped food that requires breaking into smaller-sized
fiible portions for swallowing, or vegetable matter that is not firmly
ttached require to be fixed in position so that the beak might work on
hem the more easily.
Nuthatches and some woodpeckers get stability of the food mass by
/edging nuts and such cumbersome items into the crevices of tree-bark.
[ ^ birds have taken &amp;gt; what would seem to us, the obvious step and
 |ibstituted legs and feet for the " missing " arms and hands.

manner has been separately evolved for each of these families. Thrushes
and Shrikes--both of which feed on large items--have perhaps yet to
develop this practise. Shrikes impale food to stop it moving and Song-
Thrushes ( Turdus philomelos) hammer snails on stones. Apart from this
exception the other thrushes rely on the trauma of rubbing the food harshly
along the ground, and the inertia of the food mass to break off portions as
the bird shakes its head. Neither seem to be as efficient, as perhaps- they
otherwise might be, if they used the foot for purchase. Shrikes must find
beetles and small mammals tough to thrust a thorn through and many trees
are thornless or lack sharp spurs. Likewise Song-Thrushes may not always
have a stone to hand and the ground may be too soft and yielding for
rubbing and mutilating worms against.
Two species of pigeons are exceptional in that they can fix food with
the foot (Goodwin) the remainder of the Columbidae peck away, when
tackling something bulky, at a continuously deflected target. Not
surprisingly one of these foot-holding pigeons--the Tooth-billed Pigeon
(Didunculus strigirostris) --has developed a thicker, tougher bill to in-
crease its efficiency (by rasping?). The other bird--the Marquessa
Ground Dove ( Gallicolumba rubescens) has a beak that seems to be no
stouter than other members of the same genus (Bleeding-heart-Pigeons,
say).
Eating in this way--food clasped to the perch or pressed on the ground
--retains the disadvantage that a bird so eating will have to continuously
break off from its meal to raise the head and look out for danger. The
" logical " step is to take the food up to the mouth clasped in a foot.
Whereas this is almost universal in small, predator-prone mammals--
such as rodents--it occurs in, as far as I can determine, very few families
of birds: Rails (Rallidae), hawks (Accipitridae), falcons (Falconidae),
mousebirds (Coliidae) and parrots (Psittacidae).
Anatomically the foot of a bird does have certain structural disadvantag-
es in being used as a hand. Ankylosis of bones forming the leg-skeleton
makes rotatory movements of the " ankle " impossible. Similarh
flexion of the leg simultaneously bends both stifle and " heel the)
do not move very independantly one of another. Once the leg is lifted
most movement comes from the hip joint and it is the outside of the
foot that is uppermost--not the " thumb-side " as would be a mammals
foot. In the same way that a bird walking straight ahead, especially on #
thin branch, is exaggeratedly " pigeon toed "--the outside edge of the fool
leading.
For the purpose of this article I shall refer to those birds that clamp
the food with the foot as being tether-footed , and those that use the foo
as a hand as prehensile-footed.
Except for vultures--which have short-toed, stocky legs most diurna
birds of prey show great dexterity in the use that they make of their feet
they use them to strike at, to grasp, to kill, to carry and, in Honey-Buzzards

(Pernis), to dig with. The feet of these raptors may be facile enough
to enable them to feed in a prehensile-footed manner but the dismember-
ing of a carcass, requiring as it does the very maximum of leverage, can
only be satisfactorily achieved by standing upon it with the full weight of
the body and tearing with the beak. It would be a pointless feeding
development to eat in any other than a tether-footed way. Plowever
those falcons that feed on aerial insects and the nocturnal bat-falcon
(Machaerhamphus) --which eats bats, swallowed whole--catch and kill
their prey with the feet, then, while still in flight, eat by holding the
food prehensile-footed up to the bill. Snail kites ( Rostramus spp .)
likewise feed from a raised foot but the bird settles on a perch before
holding the fresh-water winkles which they eat up to the head.
Parrots form a very natural Order of birds. The anatomical character-
istics that distinguish them from other birds--the short neck, hinged
hooked bill enclosing a thick muscular tongue, and the short legs with
zygodactyled feet--have developed as a consequence of being arboreal.
Parrots not only use the foot as a hand but can use the bill as a foot. The
usual progression when climbing is tripodal. The beak bites onto the
branch ahead and by flexing of the neck takes its stride in co-ordination
with the feet. (Hoatzin chicks are said to clamber in similiar manner
using the beak for purchase as well as their " fingered " wings). Instead
of clasping, the beak may be rested firmly down on its tip stabilising the
stride like a walking stick. Thirdly the tip of the hooked upper mandible
can be looped over a twig, the lower mandible passively closed, and
progression is then akin to a mountaineer climbing with an ice-pick.
Exceptionally few parrots seem not to climb. Strigops , the New
Zealand Kakapo, Pezoporus the Ground-parrakeet and perhaps
Geopsittacus the extinct Night-parrot. These are terrestrial and are said
in captivity to avoid branches unless wide and sloping. Cyanoramphus --
New Zealand parrakeets--can "tripode" yet, even when scaling vertical
wire netting, do not often use the beak. The head is held high, like a
climbing woodpecker, and they proceed thus much faster than a parrot
climbing in the orthodox manner. Incidently Tavistock (1931) mentions
that an Antipodes parrakeet (C. unicolor) he possessed could not scale
netting. These four genera of parrots have longer tarsi than other
parrots. Contrariwise those parrots that have very short legs, such as
Amazona parrots, often use the beak as a " walking stick " even when
&apos; moving on the ground or on horizontal, thick branches.
The way parrots use the beak, when feeding or destructively biting, is
ilso exceptional in birds. Birds as a rule peck--their bill is analagous to a
vair of forceps--albeit forceps of varying shapes. Parrots gnaw or chew
nto food exactly as do ruminant mammals. These both have the sharp
:utting edge of the lower jaw working against the blunt surface of the
ipper jaw. Ruminants have no upper incisor teeth and parrots have no
edge " to the upper mandible. In a parrot the item to be dealt with is

96 G. A. SMITH--USING THE FOOT IN FEEDING WITH REFERENCE TO PARROTS
steadied by the stubby tongue against the rather broad, flattened and
ridged base of the hooked beak tip: whilst the C-shaped edge of the lower
bill is driven forward to pare into the item just like a carpenter's gouge
working on a piece of wood held in a vice. When the tongue (which is
used as, and looks not unlike, a human thumb even to the extent in some
parrots of having a " nail ") is insufficient to give stability to whatever is
held in the beak then extra purchase is given by the foot. Unlike birds
of prey and Colies the item is not generally lifted up directly by the foot.
It is almost invariably taken by the beak first. The only exceptions to
this rule that I know of is an African Grey Parrot owned by Mr. Clifford
Smith (1970) that is said always to feed by grabbing a fistful of seeds
which are then transfered to the beak, and Yellow-fronted New Zealand
Parrakeets may pull distant bud-bearing twigs towards the head with a
" hand ". It is also very rare for a parrot to carry something in the foot,
which is something that Shrikes can do. It has been seen however in a
Stanley Parrakeet disturbed while feeding (Marriot); the landing of the
bird was said to be remarkably awkward.
As the majority of parrots are prehensile-footed the selective pressures
originating and maintaining this behaviour must be very strong. Few
parrots cannot use the feet when feeding and those that do not are all
similar in that they are ( a ) usually sexually dimorphic, ( b ) are small for
parrots, weighing less than 90 grams (three ounces), (c) and feed either
on the ground on grass seed and other small seeds, or eat seeds of figs and
other fruits rather than the fruit substance.
Though small in number of species they are important aviculturally as
they form the larger proportion of parrots that are regularly bred and
kept in captivity.
Parrots may, for all purposes, be conveniently divided into three

have considered them in that placing.
(1) New-world parrots are characterised by the sexes being identical in
colouring. Ignoring the 12 species of parrotlets ( Touit and Forpus) then
only six species from a total of the other 125 American parrots are
sexually dimorphic--Red-capped parrot ( Pionopsitta pileata), Massenas'
parrot ( Pionus seniloides), Purple-bellied parrot ( Triclaria malachitacea)

and the northern form of the Mountain parrakeet (Bolborhynchus a
aurtfrons)-- the southern race has both sexes uniformly green--and
two Amazon parrots (that may well be judged nonspecific for they are
allopatric and differ one from another only by the colour of the Ioreal
feathers) the Spectacled and the Yellow-lored (A. albifrons and A
xantholora).
J, Forpus parrotlets are not, to my observation, prehensile nor tether-
footed. All five (or six) species are sexually dimorphic. Unfortunately
the second genus of parrotlets-TWt-never seem to be kept in captivity
\ery few published accounts of any parrot species, and Touit parrotlets
jare not exceptional in this, make remark on the use played by the feet
in feeding. The related Brotogeris parrakeets are definitely prehensile-
footed. This is no guide (c.v. Australian Broad-tail Parrakeets in (3)) as
to how Touit parrotlets may behave. Five of the seven Touit parrotlet
species are sexually dimorphic. To my knowledge all the American
parrots, save Forpus (and possibly Touit) are prehensile-footed. Or one
renus (or two) from a total of twenty-two genera. And these exceptions
ire the smallest of the parrots found in this geographical area.
(2) Afro-Asian parrots are in strong contrast to (i) mostly sexually
iimorphic (33 of the 47 species). To be more accurate all but two of the
ii Asian parrots are dimorphic and five of the 16 African ones. Three
&amp;gt;t the five sexually dimorphic African parrots are lovebirds (Agabornis)
"nd one-the Ringneck Parrakeet ( Psittacula k. krameri)-i s a fairly
ecent invader " from Asia.
Lovebirds are the only Afro-Asian parrots that are not prehensile-
ooted, and as stated above, three of the six species are sexually dimorphic,

98 G. A. SMITH--USING THE FOOT IN FEEDING WITH REFERENCE TO PARROTS
Loriinae The Brush-tongued parrots
From 56 species of which only eight are sexually dimorphic--the genera
Charmosyna and Oreopsittacus , nothing of relevance seems to be written
as to the habits of either genus. However, all of the commonly kept
brush-tongues ( Trichoglossus , Domtcella and Eos&apos;) are prehensile-footed.
As with hanging parrots the foot is never held poised as high as would,
say, a conure or an Eclectus parrot. Often it may be held so low that
the&apos;food may actually hang below the level of the perch. Again, like
hanging parrots, the foot holding the piece of fruit is often lowered to rest
the tarsus or food directly on the perch. What is most noticeable is
that all Loriinae seem to be just as strongly tether as prehensile-footed and
some individuals never seem to involve the feet at all when feeding. (It
should be noticed that a large, unwieldy portion of fruit be offered if
observation of this habit is to be made.) The individuals that cannot be
coerced into using the feet one way or another feed clumsily on large
free objects by simultaneously holding them on the perch with the beak
and at the same time gnawing into them. Perhaps the Loriinae scrambling
as they do about flowering and fruiting trees have little need to hold food
with the foot in the wild. If this is the case then the facility may be in
abeyance in this " sub-family through lack of selective pressures.
Nestoriinae , Keas and Kaka s
These large birds, that seem in so many ways to fill the ecological niche
in New Zealand that is occupied by crows in other parts of the world,
are probably related to the Loriinae. The tongue is papillated, they have
similar vivid underwing coverts and they progress by a series of skips
and hops--rather than walking as do other parrots. They seem to prefer
vegetable and animal food to seeds. Seeds taken with fruits are voided
in the faeces intact (Porter 1934). Large items are said by Yealland to
be " impaled on the upper and grated with the lower beak They are
tether-footed seldom feeding prehensile-footed--though Kakas at least
can hold food in this way.
Kakatoeinae , Cockatoos
Fourteen of the 15 species are strongly prehensile-footed. The
exception--the Cockatiel ( Nymphicus hollandicus) is by far the smallest
in size and is one of two that are extremely dimorphic. Cockatiels make
no feeding use of the feet.
Micropsittinae , Pigmy parrots
The six species are all sexually dimorphic. Little seems to be known
concerning the feeding habits of pigmy parrots. If they, as seems likely,
live on fungal mycaelia growing on the bark of trees (Bergman i960)
then it may not be unreasonable to suggest that they may not need to
involve the feet in feeding.
Strigopiinae, the Owl-parrot or Kakapo
Nothing recorded.

Psittacmae, the parrots "proper "
Members of this subfamily " are the most commonly kept in captivity
and consequently the most written about yet there is a dearth of informa-
tion on any behaviour, least of all use of the feet, other than breeding
activities.
Fifty-eight Psittacine parrots inhabit the Australasian area. Fourteen
species make no use of the feet whatsoever. These birds are all ground
feeders and are--with two exceptions--sexually dimorphic. They are
the Grass-parrakeets (Neophema), the Redrump family (. Psephotus ) and
the Budgerigar. It is a strong assumption that the Ground Parrakeet
and the Night Parrakeet, feeding as they do on similar foods and being
even more markedly terrestrial, also do not use the feet.
Rosellas ( Platycercus ), Australian Ringneck Parrakeets ( Barnardius ),
Pileated ( Purpureocephalus ), Kakarikis ( Cyanoramphus ), Horned parrakeet
( Eunymphicus) and the Swift parrakeet {Lathamus)--2L total of 18 species--
f are a11 prehensile-footed and the sexes are alike, or but slightly different-
iated. These birds obtain their food both from trees and off the ground,
ij The three Polyteline Parrakeets are all dimorphic, use the feet, and feed
off the ground. When fruit is thrown on the ground aviary-housed
Princess of Wales' tend to eat it where it falls rather then picking it up in
a beak and flying to a perch to feed from the feet.
The final group of Australian parrots are arboreal. In aviaries they
tend, unless the room given is very large, to be wary of settling on
the floor and therefore make dull exhibits. Most are extremely
sexually dimorphic and in their food preference show similarity to the
Asian sexually dimorphic parrots. Aprosmictus , Alisterus , Prosopeia ,
Eclectus, Geoffroyus and Psittnchas (Kings, Crimson-wings, Shining,
Geoffroy's and Pesquet's parrots) are all prehensile-footed. The Ground
parrots of New Guinea (Psittacella) I infer use the feet. (Rand and
Gilhard say the diet includes seeds from coniferous trees. All the birds
that I know of that live on a similar diet--Crossbills, Nutcrackers and
two American parrots Enicognathus and Rhynchopsitta --Slender-billed
[&apos; an&lt; ^ Thick-billed Parrakeets--steady the cone with a foot when extracting
I the nuts).
j Unfortunately I have not seen, nor do I know of anyone who has kept--
that I might ask--the fig parrots Opopsitta and Psittacularostris. My
suggestion is that they probably are no different from the other arboreal,
fruit-eating parrots in making use of their feet when feeding.

(Tanagra laniirostris)
By D. G. Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
Birds of dry forest and open woodland, Thick-billed Euphonias are
found in the tropical and sub-tropical zones of Northern South America.
The male is attractively coloured with brilliant golden-yellow underparts,
crown and forehead and glossy purple-blue upperparts. The female is a
uniform sage-green, lighter beneath.
r Our pair arrived in August 1969, but it was not until March 1970 that
any sign of courtship was observed, when it was noticed that when the
birds perched within a few inches of each other, usually the cock slightly
higher, the birds would face each other, all body feathers erect and "cheep"
loudly and continuously for 3 or 4 seconds. Apart from these short
outbursts the cock was rarely heard to make a sound, but the female_
when moving about the flight--called loudly and regularly.
On the 25th March the female was seen carrying small pieces of dry
grass into a dense clump of gnarled ivy, about 3 feet from the ground.
For about three days no real progress was made as the grasses kept falling
out, so a small hand-made cup of soft, dead grass was placed in the site
chosen by the birds and a close watch kept.
Both birds soon flew down to investigate, the female quickly entering
to rearrange the nest to her liking. Additional material, moss and root-
lets, were added by the birds, the female doing most of the work, the male
merely passing suitable pieces on, and by the 1st May the domed nest
appeared complete. On that day the female spent quite some time in the
nest, and it was now, for the first time, that the cock was heard to sing a
surprisingly long and varied song, liquid and sweet.
On the 2nd of May it appeared that an egg had been laid as the female
left the nest only to feed and drink. Throughout the incubation period
t was the female only who brooded the eggs, though the male frequently
nspected the nest while his mate was away.
On the morning of the 19th May an egg-shell was found lying about a
oot away from the nest. The shell had a pinkish-white ground colour
leavily spotted at the broad end with light brown, lightly spotted else-
vhere.
That evening both birds were seen to regurgitate food to a chick in the
j ies t the male usually fed from just outside the nest, or perched upon
he nest entrance, the female at this time usually entered to feed the
I *ung.
We now had a very difficult job in finding sufficient suitable livefood,
 |s the only food the adults would take was spiders, which were placed one
t a time upon the wire mesh of the flight; the bird upon seeing it would

zoom down, hover for a second or two then dart and grab it, taking it to a
favourite perch to rub off the legs before swallowing it.
Before feeding the spiders to their young the adults would usually
take a few pieces of grape (which were doused in a multivitamin mixture)
just swallowing the pulp and leaving the skin.
On the 31st May three bright pink gapes could be seen at the nest
entrance, the chicks squeaking loudly at the adults approach. Should
the chicks be unaware of the adults approach the adult would give a
quiet mewling " cheep " which immediately resulted in the chicks
begging vociferously.
On the 3rd June one chick was found on the floor beneath the nest,
chilled and unmoving. Despite attempts to revive it the chick died.
Weighing 2.5 gms. the dark-skinned chick was quite well covered with
sprouting pinfeathers which showed sage green on the back and yellowish
green beneath. ,
On the 8th June the parents were seen to feed plain fruit, i.e. banana
and grape to their young and on the 13th June a chick left the nest, 26
days after the first egg hatched. _ . . ;
The parents were not seen to visit the nest again and on investigation
the third chick was found dead.
The surviving chick, a miniature of its drab mother, moved about
quite well though its flight was peculiarly weak. The chick was caught
up and it could be seen that the flight feathers were imperfectly formed,
the vanes being fibrous, partially disintegrated and whitish. All other
feathers including the tail were normal.
However the chick got about well enough and on the 28th June it was
seen feeding itself upon banana, though at this time it still continued to
beg food from its parents.
Now almost 1 year old the chick has the same drab plumage as its
mother, but it has been heard to sing on two occasions.
Euphonias sometimes take more than a year to gam their adult plumage
and are believed to sometimes breed in transitional plumage.
When a flight feather was removed a perfectly formed grey feather grew
to replace it. The abnormality of these feathers has been attributed to
the insufficient supply of spiders, they being the only livefood that the
birds would feed to their young.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON AUSTRALIAN
AVICULTURE AND A REVIEW OF THE
BIRD COLLECTION AT TARONGA ZOO
SYDNEY, FOR 1970

By Kerry A. Muller
(Curator of Birds, Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
The woild s aviculturists and ornithologists have maintained a keen
interest in Australian birds ever since their discovery. It is an unfortunate
fact, however, that news on events of Australian aviculture seldom
become available to other aviculturists. Occasionally a visiting dignitary,
such as Dr. Jean Delacour, publishes impressions of the collections he
dewed while passing through Australia but, in general, many achievements
n Australian aviculture remain unknown and unpublished.
Communication among aviculturists within Australia is not much
setter. There are several reputable avicultural societies in Australia,
ind a lot of work is done to promote articles, lectures and tours among
nembers often without a lot of co-operation from the members. One
iroblem seems to he in the unfortunate fact that bird theft and smuggling
0 foreign countries is a highly profitable and well organized business in
Australia. I wonder how many European and American aviculturists
lave seriously questioned where all the cockatoos, Rosellas and other
Australian parrots come from? None were exported legally. Because
&amp;gt;f this situation many Australians have learned the hard way that to invite
^stranger (or even acquaintances) to view their collection may result in
he eventual theft of their most prized birds. Because of this, many
vicultunsts are suspicious of strangers and do not advertise their breeding
uccesses, particularly with psittacines.
A second problem in communication among Australian aviculturists
eems to lie with the complex laws, both Federal and State, governing the
ght t0 keep Australian birds in captivity. Many aviculturists keep and
ropagate a wide variety of native species but, because of uncertainty as
) their legal status in doing so, do not advertise their successes.
The major zoos in Australia are leading the way to productive inter-
lange of ideas and techniques in aviculture and the management of birds
1 captivity. The association of Zoo Directors of Australia and New
ealand, inaugurated in 1967, is opening new vistas of professional
^operation and combined research into shared problems. This pool
intellectual resources and experience of some very talented and forward
anking zoo directors and their respective staffs, has resulted in a very
ialthy environment for the growth of these major zoos in Australia and
ew Zealand, and is reflected in their expanding and improved exhibits,
id in the increased scope of their inventories and propagation results..

K. A. MULLER--OBSERVATIONS ON AUSTRALIAN AVICULTURE
In their degree of involvement in public education the major Australian
zoos occupy a leading position in the world.
In Australia the Taronga Zoological Park has traditionally held pre-
eminence, both in size and the variety of the collection. The bird inven-
tory is among the world's largest in a zoo, the count as of 30th June 1970 j
being 3,082 specimens. The number of species, however, has remained
relatively small, and, at that time, was 234. _ . ..
The greatest obstacle to expansion of a bird collection in Australia is
the absolute ban on importation of any birds under any circumstances from
any country except New Zealand. This restriction has been in effect in
Australia for twenty-two years, and it is quite a tribute to Australian
aviculturists that there are still quite a few species of foreign birds in
aviaries. These are either very old or have been propagated in the country
over a period of at least 22 years. _ . . ^
Several species of foreign finches are common in aviaries here, bor
instance the Cuban Finch, which has been scarce in the United States for
several years (for obvious reasons) is a common aviary bird here. Other
species often seen are Senegal Fire-finches, Cordon-bleu, Orange-breasted
and Common Waxbills, Aurora, Melba, Cut-throat, Spice, Pale-headed
and other species of Munias, Java Sparrows, Red-crested Cardina,
Jacarina Finches and several others. A few species of Asiatic parrots can
be seen, including Lutino, Blue and Common Indian Ring-neck, Blossom-
headed Parakeets, Moustache Parakeets, Long-tailed Parakeets, Slaty-
headed Parakeets and Derbyan Parakeets. Peach-faced, Masked
Nyassa and Fischers Lovebirds can still be found. Several species ot
pheasants are also common, including Golden, Silver, Amherst, Reeves,
Nepal kalij, Swinhoes; the Chinese ringnecks, Mongolian rmgnecks,
Black-necks and Melanestic mutant forms of the Common Pheasant;
Siamese Firebacks, and a few Edwards and Cheers, as well as Blue and
Green Peafowl. .
Foreign waterfowl are scarce but some Mandarins, Mute Swans, Rudd\
and Paradise Shelducks can be found, and lots of Mallards. Rheas anc
Ostriches still are progagated in zoos.
A second difficulty in the expansion of a zoo bird collection lies in t u
difficulty of obtaining native species. There are over seven hundrec
species of birds in this country, and many are unique to the Australasia!
regions, but a very small percentage of these are to be found in zoos
Although most of the parrots and finches can be obtained from reputabl.
dealers, very few other species are available, and the permits necessary tc
trap them in the wild often prove difficult to obtain. Even when permit;
are obtained, a trapping expedition can prove both costly and time
consuming.
The breeding season from 1st July 1969 to 30th June 1970 at larong
Zoo was moderately successful. 329 birds of 40 species were hatched
Noteworthy examples were 1 North Island Brown Kiwi, 2 Musk Lonkeel

i Glossy Black Cockatoo, i Sacred Kingfisher, i Blue-winged Kookaburra
i Regent Bower-bird, and 4 Red Wattlebird. The remainder were a
variety of waterfowl, game-birds, pigeons, parrots and finches.
The current breeding season, beginning 1st July 1970, is going well.
To date we have hatched 2 Regent Bower-birds, 2 Blue-winged Kooka-
burras (female now on second clutch of eggs), 3 Owlet-nightjars (first
breeding record), 3 Musk Lorikeets, 3 Swift Parrots, 7 Yellow-crowned
Kakariki, 3 Hooded Parrots, 4 Blossom-headed Parakeets, 1 Victoria
Crowned Pigeon, 4 Paradise Shelduck and lots of other species.
In an effort to expand the collection in variety from the traditional
Parrots and Finches, several species representing new families and rarer
varieties ha\ e been added. Included in these are Green Pygmy Geese
Crimson-chats, seveial species of Honeyeaters, Dollar birds, Bee-eaters'
Olive-backed Orioles and Southern Figbirds, Variegated Wrens, Eastern
Shriketits, Golden and Rufous Whistlers, and several species of Flycatchers
and related insectivorous birds. A marine bird display has been com-
pleted with running sea water in which we are successfully keeping
Wandering Albatross, Giant Petrels, Gannets, Cormorants, Fairy
Penguins, Gulls and Terns.
Under construction at present is a large outdoor walkthrough flight
cage of unique design, in which it is planned to provide a rainforest for
those species adapted to the various ecosystems within this type of habitat.
A series of new waterfowl ponds are also under construction, in the hope
of eventually keeping and propagating the rarer species of Australian
waterfowl.
I regard one of my responsibilities as curator of birds (a post I assumed
here on 1st August 1970), to keep informed of events in aviculture from
other parts of the world, and also to inform other aviculturists of what is
occurring here. To that end I shall endeavour to submit periodical
reports, via the Avicultural Magazine, on what is being achieved here
ind on my observations of other Australian avicultural events.

(Nestor notabilis and Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha)
By G. Michael Elieg (Curator of Birds, Brookfield Zoo, Chicago, U.S.A.)
In the fall of 1970 at Brookfield Zoo (Chicago), I had a chance to
experiment wintering two species of parrots outdoors the Kea and !
Thick Billed Parrot. These species were decided upon because of the |
frigid natural habitats they occupy. The Kea is found above the timber
line in New Zealand whereas the Thick Bill lives in the high mountain
forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.
Three Keas were housed in an aviary 5x3x4 metres and three large ^
barrels were provided for shelter. The Thick Bill was in a nearb} 1
aviary 3x3x4 metres. Both roofed aviaries were open only on the
northern exposure and took the full brunt of the winter.
Meteorological data from November through March is shown in
Table 1 to give an idea of the Chicago winter. There were seven days M
below o*F. in January. Wind gusts of up to 58 miles per hour were
evident all winter long. There was generally an absence of sunshine as
shown in Table 1 and precipitation in the form of rain or snow was
normal for the season.

The Keas never used their barrels and were out climbing the aviary
wire a great deal of the time. The only problem attributed to cold was
that of a Kea touching his foot to the cold wire after stepping into the
water dish. This caused the integument to adhere to the wire. When
the bird pulled his foot away there was a sore which healed quickly wit!
no adverse effects.
The Thick Bill used the box constantly, coming out only to feed or tc
soak in the occasional sunshine. We can conclude that these two specie,
are extremely cold hardy and can possibly be worked into year-rounc

Under the Commonwealth of Australia's List in the New Year's
Honours, Mr. Fred Shaw Mayer was made a Member of the Most
Honourable Order of the British Empire for " services to aviculture ".
Mr. Shaw Mayer s work for aviculture has long been highly regarded in
avicultural circles and this unique honour will be warmly welcomed all
over the world, not only as a tribute to Mr. Shaw Mayer but also as the
first ever official recognition of the value of aviculture.

properly be applied to colonies of gannets and penguins. A " rookery
of penguins " sounds inappropriate in the extreme.

When, in 1929, the Marquess of Tavistock published his " Parrots
and Parrot-like Birds in Aviculture " he wrote fully and informatively on
:he species that he had kept, but many others rated little more than a
iescription. Lord Tavistock did, however, include a few asides. When,
or instance, a Mexican trapper was asked why he did not catch Thick-
ailled Parrakeets, he replied: " Sehor, they are no good. Bite like hell.
3 erhaps catch three, four pair; no can use hands for weeks. Lady no
)u y; gentleman no buy; and dam bird no good to eat. What de hell

Mrs. Brenda Rhodes (in lift. 17th March, 1971): "My Black-tailed
Conures Pyrrhura melanura that gained the Society's Medal for me last
year have again been successful. Four lovely young ones have left the
nest and are starting to feed themselves. The parents were not so shy
this time and so I was able to look into the nest early on and I counted
five eggs. When the oldest young one was four weeks I looked in again j
and there were four chicks. All were covered in dark grey down with a
few quills showing. The one I took to be the oldest had a flash of red
on the shoulder."

In the Magazine, 1964, 15-18, Charles Everitt gave a breeding account
of the Natal Kingfishers Ispidina picta in the Edward Marshall Boehm
aviaries. Now a success has been obtained in Europe, at the Zoo in
Frankfurt am Main. In 1969 the first hatching consisted of two young
ones that left the nest after 20 days; in the second one young left after
19 days. The third nest produced three young that were found dead
in front of the nest-hole 13 days after hatching. A fourth consisted of
two young; one was thrown out of the nest after five days, the other left
the nest but had a deformed foot.

Included in the recent Sotheby sale of Natural History specimens was
a semi-fossilised egg of the long extinct " Elephant Bird " Aepyornis
maximus , of Madagascar, for which Quaritch gave #1,000. This was a
very tall (nine to ten feet) Ratite bird of particularly massive build, with
very stout legs. It is said to have weighed up to half a ton. The present
shell, of an off-white colour, measures: longest circumference 33-25 in.,
girth 28 in., length 15 in. Eggs weighed about 20 lb. and it is estimated
that the liquid content of average specimens was as much as two gallons--
148 hens' eggs. Between 1893 and 1919 about ten similar eggs were
sold at Stevens Auction Rooms for prices up to 70 guineas.

During the course of a year I receive many requests for information
on birds. The great majority are of a serious nature but just a few may 1
be classed as facetious. A recent query concerning " The Liver Birds ", !
a current television series on the amorous adventures of two Liverpool
batchelor girls, certainly falls into the latter category.
There have been many theories on the origin of the City's name, but
none is very convincing. In the early 17th century a bird was depicted
on the Common Seal of the town. It was lost during the siege of 1644
and the copy then made was so unskilful that the bird resembled a
Cormorant rather than the original eagle of St. John the Evangelist. For
want of a better name, and by back-formation, antiquarians have called
it the Liver. A Liver appears twice in the Coat of Arms of the City
and also as the Crest.

A mounted specimen of the Great Auk or Garefowl Pinguinus (Alca)
impennis realised #9,000 at Southeby's on 4th March 1971, an auction
record for a natural history specimen. It was sent by Baron Raben-
Levetzau, Aalholm Castle, Denmark, and is believed to have been collected
by Count F. C. Raben, in Iceland in 1821. The purchaser was Dr.
Finnur Gudmundsson, Director, Museum of Natural History, Reykjavik,
with funds raised by the Rotary Kiwanis Lion Clubs. There are 79
or 81 skins in 39 museums, but none apparently in Iceland until now.
It is believed there are 68 or yo eggs in existance; 45 of which are, or
were at one time, in the British Isles. This large, flightless, North
Atlantic seabird was exterminated by the wholesale slaughter at the
breeding places by French sailors who visited Newfoundland to fish and
who depended greatly upon the " Penguin " for a supply of food. The
last pair was killed between 2nd and 5th June 1844* cm Eldey, a skerry off
the south-east coast of Iceland, and was sold for about #9.

Some years ago I tried to obtain eggs of the Onagadori--the long-tailed
.owl of the island of Shikoku, south-west Japan. I was quite unsuccessful
and, I believe, others have had as little success. But last year Dr. Frank
K. Ogasawara, an avian physiologist at the University of California,
Davis, returned to the U.S.A. from a visit to Japan, sponsored by the
National Geographic Society. The doctor took with him 30 eggs, ic of
vhich hatched.
The Onagadori is the fowl that has been known to grow tail plumage
hat may exceed 30 ft. in length. Both the male and female are able to
)ass on the special genes to their progeny, but only the males grow the
ong feathers. They are not moulted and do not reach their full, magnifi-
cent length until the bird is perhaps nine or ten years old. A matter
uch as this may be considered as rather outside aviculture as understood
&amp;gt;y the majority of our members. It is not included on account of shortage
&amp;gt;f material, due in the main to the postal dispute, but it is considered of
uflicient general interest to warrant inclusion in this column. Some
esearch has already been done at the Nagoya University, but the field is
vide open to Dr. Ogasawara for studies of the abnormal cell growth that
*roduces the long feathers. A. A. P.

ston Publishing Company, 1970. $10.
This book, published for the Pan-American Section of the International 1
Council for Bird Preservation, is a small field guide which helps to fill one :&lt;
of the remaining gaps in the world coverage of bird identification--that |j
of the Central American mainland. The text, and half of the plates, were 1
prepared by the author, but regrettably he died at the age of 39, before 1
the book was in its final stages. The remaining half of the plates are by i
H. Wayne Trimm.
There is a valuable introduction on the country and its bird distribution, I
with maps of relief, vegetation and habitat zones. In the main text
distribution maps are given for species, with relative commonness
indicated to some extent by intensity of shading. The text for each
species is a brief statement of range, status, elevation (in a rather rugged
country), habitat, description, and brief comments on voice and behaviour
where appropriate. Within Central America species with wide range but !
distinct subspeciation may occur, and the relevant subspecies are indicated. U
There are 667 species recorded for Guatemala.
The plates are in colour, with the grouping of related species for
comparison to which we have become accustomed in these field guides.
There are 45 plates and 294 species are shown; mostly resident birds
rather than migrants that might appear in other works. Dr. Land's
birds are adequately illustrated, but somewhat stiff and wooden in posture,
and the type of colour that he has used reproduces poorly; rather dark
and heavily coloured. Mr. Trimm's plates are more life-like and of
better colour, occasionally erring towards the other extreme of fussiness
in background and arrangement.
The book ends with a brief section on bird-watching in Guatemala,
and a selected bibliography. This is a very sound and useful guide to
the birds of this country; and the first one to cover this region.

ENGLISH NAMES OF PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96543084" page_id="58076549"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
The use of personal common names for birds is now generally condemned; and
in some quarters names suggesting a characteristic in regard to appearance are
preferred to those of geographical association. Having regard to the many forms
that during the past few years have been renamed, it is perhaps only natural that
in some cases the results may seem quite extraordinary. It must be agreed that
some original names were inappropriate or unimaginative and that some changes
would eventually have to be made.
Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, in his latest work "A Guide to the Birds of
South America " (1970), Curator of Birds, The Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, describes 2,926 species inhabiting South America. Of these in
belong to the great Order Psittaciformes. No less than 64 have had new names
bestowed on them, some are merely variations but some are completely new.
Gone are various old familiars: Lear's Macaw is now the Indigo; the Half-moon
Parrakeet becomes the Peach-fronted; Patagonian Conures are now Burrowing
Parrots; the Celestial Parrotlet, the Pacific; the All-green Parrakeet, the Plain;
the Hawk-headed Parrot, known as such since 1751, becomes the Red-fan Parrot.
And even our old favourite the Blue-fronted Amazon is not sacrosanct--it becomes
the Turquoise-fronted Parrot. This is surely just change for the sake of change.
Mention has only been made of some of the parrots and parrakeets, but presum-
ably there have been changes in all sections. The List gives 233 species of
Humming Birds. Here surely standardization is badly needed. All too many
members of this group have never had consistent names--they have been
coined " by writers to suit their own fancy. Now, at long last, some order may
come out of confusion--at least in this group.

We regret that it has proved impossible to publish a current
List of Members in this issue. The seven-week long postal strike
in this country resulted in serious delays in the receipt of sub-
scription renewals, resignations and new Members, and the
backlog from overseas is still reaching us so that any list published
now would be very incomplete. We hope to issue the List in the
September/October issue.
Also by reason of the postal strike, distribution of the March/
April issue of the Magazine was very late, and overseas Members
have had to wait a long time for replies to their letters and
membership queries. We apologise for these delays and hope
that all Members will by now have received their magazines and
correspondence.
May we take this opportunity of reminding those who have not
yet renewed their Membership, that their subscriptions were due
on ist January of this year. The new rate is #2.50 ($7.00).

By Dr. C. Robert Eddinger (University of Hawaii, Honolulu)
 |The Hawaiian Honeycreepers ( Drepanididae ) constitute a family of
birds found only in the Hawaiian Islands. The family is composed of
Umall birds. The largest living species, the Kauai Akaialoa ( Hemignathus
\Drocerus), is only 775 inches (194 mm) in total length; the Anianiau
\ Loxops pmvci), one of the smallest, is 4-25 inches (106 mm) in total length.
Ot the 22 full species of drepanids, eight are already extinct and eight
ithers are currently considered to be in danger of extinction (Fisher
Mmon and Vincent, 1969). The six remaining species have at least one
/alid race each in danger of extinction.
Before any of the drepanids became extinct, two species were confined
0 Nihoa and Laysan, four were distributed over some or all of the main
slands without racial distinction, and five ranged over some or all of the
nain islands with a different race on most of the islands.
I collected nestlings and hand-raised successfully: Anianiau (. Loxops
&apos;arva), Apapane (Himatione sanguined ), the Kauai race of Creeper (Loxops
iaculata bairdi), and the Kauai race of Amakihi (Loxops virens stejnegeri).
n addition, I hand-raised the Hawaii race of Amakihi (Loxops virens
irens), collected by Dr. Andrew J. Berger. To the best of my knowledge,
tus is the first time that any species of drepanid has been hand-raised,
ted the nestlings Gerber's high protein cereal for baby, Deca Vi Sol
abies vitamin drops, egg yolks, and papayas. As the birds became
idependent, to the above diet I added wheat germ, honey-water mixture,
ranges, grapefruit, apples, fly larvae, fly pupae, and autolyzed brewer's
east fraction. Techniques for hand-raising passerine birds are given by
erger (1966) and Eddinger (1969).
The Anianiau is one of the smallest Hawaiian honeycreepers. The
iult male has bright yellowish-green upper parts with bright yellow
dow, shading to white on the abdomen. The female and immatures are
filer in colour, being more grey-green to olive-green. The bill is short
id only slightly curved.
The Apapane, a deep crimson bird with black wings and tail, white
ider tail coverts, and black legs and bill, is the commonest surviving
awaiian honeycreeper. The immatures are grey to grey-brown and
&apos; through several intermediate stages before reaching full adult plumage.

114 dr. c. r. eddinger--Hawaii's endemic honeycreepers
The sexes are alike. Adults are 5*25 inches (131 mm) in total length.
The bill is slender, sharp and slightly down-curved--well adapted for
nectar--and insect-feeding.
The Kauai race of Creeper (length about 4*5 inches or 112 mm) is
brownish-grey above and creamy-white to white below. The sexes are
alike. The bill is pointed and only slightly decurved.
The Amakihi is the second most common living honeycreeper. The
Amakihi is a small (4*5 inches or 112 mm) drepanid, mainly olive-green
above, yellowish, or creamy-grey below. A dark loral mark joins the eye
and the curved dark bill. The Kauai race has a bill longer, heavier, and
more curved than races from the other islands.
The birds adjusted well to aviary conditions and enabled me to observe
at close hand, some behavioral characteristics that were more difficult to
observe in the field, such as sunbathing, water bathing, and maintenance
activities. The Hawaii Amakihi have been in our aviaries for 3! years
now. Our indoor aviaries were inadequate to induce breeding activity.
Naether (1969) very adequately explains the importance of understand-
ing the needs of birds held in captivity. While he is concerned largely
with adult birds captured in the field, his recommendations may bq
equally applied to hand-raised birds. The advantage of hand-raised
birds is, of course, that they are very tame throughout their period of
captivity and do not undergo the traumatic shock that often results when
adult birds are captured and held in aviaries.

(Trichoglossus euteles)
By Kenneth Russell (Wisbech, Cambs., England)
Some six years ago, whilst visiting the pet shop owned by Mr. Trevor
Flatt of King's Lynn, I saw two Lorikeets that were quite unknown to me
vhich I purchased. From the description given in Bates &amp; Busenbark's
'Parrots and related birds " I identified them as Perfect Lorikeets,
xmfirmed by the colour plate which I later saw in Mivart's " Monograph
)f the Lories . Though not as brilliantly coloured as many of the family,
hey are nevertheless quite attractive in my opinion, and the two I purchased
[uickly settled down in an outdoor aviary and became very tame, coming
0 the wire for a piece of fruit from my fingers as soon as they'saw me
pproach.
Ten and a half inches in length, the sexes are very much alike, the
ipper parts being a uniform grass-green. The head is a yellowish-olive,
rid in the case of my pair the hen's is smaller and more brightly coloured.'
he breast and abdomen is yellowish green. I notice that in Mivart's
escription he adds that the breast feathers have green margins which form
lore or less distinct transverse bands but in the case of my birds this is
ot so, the overall colouring being quite even. The underside of the wing
1 yellowish, edged with black, with the typical deeper yellow bar seen in
lany of the Trichoglossus species. The bills are orange and the feet grey.
They were given a box-type parakeet nest hung inside a shelter shed
ath a partially open front, into which they retired to roost each night,
he box was filled with a six inch layer of decayed wood and sawdust--
ither more than I would normally use for parakeets, in order to absorb
ie copious droppings associated with lorikeets.
After four years I was still uncertain of their sex, but last year I was
mvinced I had two hens as both birds appeared to be in a laying condition
id ultimately eggs were laid--I believe by both birds. I recalled that
; y friend, Mr. R. Kyme, of Kirton, had purchased some Perfects imported
I John Wilson of Norwich and on telephoning him was told that he
ought his two were cocks. An exchange was arranged, and the newcomer
as obviously a larger-headed bird than the hen which remained with me.
nfortunately the latter would not tolerate her potential mate and attacked
m so persistently that I had to confine her within a cage in the flight.
ltimately however they called a truce and after a few days were flvinp
 |*ether.
1 Both birds indulge in a display of rolling the body, neck and head in a
i cular motion, whilst the long tongue is projected from the mouth
wOmpanied by hissing sounds. The cock's display before the hen is
[ ara cterized by stretching his body in an upright position with bill

pressed into the throat feathers, whilst beating his wings rapidly in th
manner of a covert pheasant. It is then that the yellow underwing bar i
seen. The cock began feeding the hen but I never saw them mate
I often wonder if the lories and lorikeets copulate in the nesting bo:
as one can regularly hear strange cries and thumping sounds coming from
the nest long after dark, though of course this is pure speculation, an&lt;
although these nocturnal sounds are also heard in the nests of Masseni
Lorikeets and Red Lories in my collection I have seen the last-name* [
mating in the flight.
Both cock and hen Perfects now made frequent visits to the box in th &apos;j
daylight and by 31st March the first egg was laid. After this I made n&lt;
further inspection as the hen would leave the nest on close approach. Thi
cock perched mostly in the vicinity of the box and sometimes entered t&lt;
feed his mate.
On 23rd April young were heard being fed. The diet given was
nectar feed made from one pint of boiled water, to which one dessert
spoon of honey, one dessertspoon of Nestles Milk, a few drops of Vitave
Syrup and Farex were added. Apple was given, but not used much whilsl
feeding the young. Some sunflower seed, and bread soaked in sweetener
milk was also taken.
On 27th May I noticed that the nest-box appeared very damp in on
corner, so fearing that it was becoming badly soiled with droppings
opened the inspection door and to my great surprise saw three well-growi
young. I had hitherto believed that the clutch of all lorikeets neve
exceeded two eggs. They were all badly plucked and in a wet condition s*
I added a further layer of dry sawdust to the nest. I also removed one 0
the youngsters to give it a chance to feather more quickly, and in 24 hour
it was taking the nectar-feed on its own.
The other two young continued to develop well and on leaving the nes
were strong fliers though devoid of feathers on back and breast. Now, oi
27th June they are independent of their parents and almost fully feathered
They are duller in plumage than the adults with a dark-coloured bill. Th
only reference I have about the species in Aviculture is in Avicultura
Magazine, New Series, Volume 2, November 1903, where Mrs. Johnston
refers to a specimen in her collection that had a Weber's Lorikeet for
companion.
As described above the Perfect or Plain Parikeet Trichoglossus eutelt
has been bred by Kenneth Russell. It is believed that this may be a firs
success and any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of thi
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicat
at once with the Hon. Secretary.

Introduction
Until this last decade the breeding in captivity of this handsome
ledium-sized owl was a comparatively rare event. Prestwich (1955)
.cords a number of breedings, the first in 1867 sod the most recent
nor to the publication of his book, in 1954, at Paignton Zoological
rardens. Since then it has been bred fairly frequently. However,
ublished records giving details of breeding seem to be very few.
This paper consists of breeding information, with observations on the
ehaviour of adults and the behaviour and development of the young.
irds Studied and Methods
A pair of Barn Owls hatched in 1969, were purchased from the Zoologi-
d Society of London in November of that year. These birds were
leased in a planted aviary, 12 ft. x 8ft. x 8 ft. high, which was built to
ouse small passerines, quail, etc. and made of 2 in. x 1 in. wooden
attens and ^ in. galvanized wire mesh. Observations were made on
'is P^ir of owls and their six young from two broods, which were studied
atil separated from the parents. Two of the young birds were observed
hen transferred to another aviary.
Watches were carried out from a nearby shed, periods of observation
eluded daylight, dusk and after dark. Living in an urban area sur-
*unded by houses and street lighting, I found the night watches were
issible and sometimes surprisingly easy. The white ventral plumage
the birds is an advantage, leg rings helped with the identification of
dividuals. The study of the adults and one pair of " young " is being
*ntinued in 1971. 6
reeding
During the first two months after reception the female was sluggish,
en after dark. The male was very active, at dusk he would fly from the
p of a small apex roof, the roosting site and drop from a perch to a
itten near the aviary floor. This would be repeated some 20 to 25 times,
what appeared to be " killing practice ". The exact spot in the batten
is struck with the feet every time, with a return to the same area on the
rch. This routine preceded any other activity, such as flying from
rch to perch, or walking and running on the ground.
In early bebruary the " wild shriek " call was heard every night. The
Hale became active and diurnal activity was increased, the male walking
d running on the floor and taking food to the roost.

The female began to spend most of the day on a board under the ape?
roof. I tacked up some hardboard around this, making a crude bo?;
measuring 17 in. x 14 in. x 15 in, open at one end. Sometimes the male
roosted with her in this box, which became covered with disgorgec
pellets. The first egg was laid on the 14th March.

Incubation with both clutches commenced when the first egg was laid
Except for a brief exercise flight the female was not seen to leave the bo:
from the 14th March until the 25th August. In most cases I had to lif
her out of the box to ring, examine or photograph the chicks. Sh&lt;
returned as soon as I had left the aviary. When the aviary was entered
she would hiss and bill-snap, striking at my hand when lifted from th&lt;
box. Whether in the box or on the apex roof, the male would fly to&apos;;
perch before the aviary was entered, he would then give a threat display
with hisses and bill-snaps.
Three broken eggs were found on the aviary floor from the first clutcl
of seven eggs, no trace could be found of the fourth. With the seconi
clutch of eight, four eggs were broken and one was found on the floo
showing a slight dent. This egg contained a developed chick nea
hatching.
I suspected broken eggs were removed by the parents, as a 2 in. rin
at the open end of the box, made an accidental " kick out " unlikely
This theory was supported on one occasion when during a night watch
the male flew from the box with a piece of broken egg shell in his bill

Chicks seen to feed themselves. Allo-preening with adult male. Still
returning to nest-box, but not every day.
The preceding list shows what would appear to be the more important
stages in growth and development. One of the most interesting aspects
was the activity shown and strong vocalization at day 1. This was
confirmed with four chicks, one in the first brood, and each of the second
brood of three.
I thought the " drive " and ability to return to the nest box during the
48-54 day period was noteworthy. The box was 5 ft. 6 in. from the
aviary floor, with 18 in. between the box entrance and the side of the
aviary. The young birds, unable to fly and without a convenient perch,
accomplished this difficult manoeuvre by " walking " up the wire with
wings flapping, until opposite the entrance, then jumping from the wire
: into the box. When they failed and dropped to the floor, another attempt

would be made almost immediately. The largest number of unsuccess-
ful consecutive attempts recorded was five. The pattern for leaving the
nest-box, in order of age and at dusk, or soon after nightfall, was the same
in both broods. One or two days before leaving the wings of the eldest
chick could often be seen hanging over the edge of the box entrance.
Before leaving the box, the chicks would look out, making complex
lateral-lateral and circular " focusing " or " orientation " movements of
the head. After this " observation " period, the chick would drop to
the aviary floor and carry out an apparently exploratory walk around the
aviary, looking in the direction of any movement or noise, or the adult
male if he were out of the box.
On the night of leaving and sometimes the following night, they would
return to the box, or try to, within half an hour. After this no return
was seen during the night, although they did go back during the morning
and all three would be in the box about 8.0 a.m.
When fully fledged they would often run rapidly around the aviary,
stopping suddenly for wing-flapping exercises, with jumps into the air.
" Killing practice " would be carried out on roots, stumps and food,
striking with one or both feet.

During this period of development an activity was observed in both
broods, which may be described as play. The actor would run across the
aviary and push with its head, or facial disc region, into the facial disc of
another chick, who would then push back, sometimes one or both losing
balance. The actor would then run across the aviary, followed by the reactor.
During the chase the third chick would often become involved, with the
roles of actor and reactor changing rapidly. On one occasion the pushing
developed into " bill fencing ", the actor gripping with its bill, the bill of
the reactor. The actor would then turn its head to the side and down and
so twisting down the head of the other chick.

Food and Feeding

<bodyText confidence="0.998124272727273" page_id="58076568"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
Since acquiring these birds, I have generally overfed them. Their diet
has been rats and mice. Large rats are cut up before feeding. The
average daily amount for the adult pair is about 10 mice or young rats, or
2-3 adult rats, without a " fast day ". When the young hatched, the
" ration " was increased to 20-25 mice or 5-6 large rats. Usually food
items had been kept in a deep freeze and thawed for 24 hours before
feeding.
Beginning in early January, there was evidence of " food storage ".
Mice and portions of rat were found wedged in the forks of branches, the
position suggesting they had not been dropped in by accident. Once an
albino mouse was found fixed in the ^ in. wire mesh.

After the nest-box was made, uneaten mice and rat portions were found
inside it every day. The male took food to the box at any time during
the day or night. Omce incubation commenced, the male would fly
down and pick up a food item soon after the food was placed in the
aviary; this would usually be between 7.30 p.m. and 9.0 p.m. The male
would continue to take food to the box until the feeding site was cleared.
Uneaten food from the previous days feeding was removed by the male.
This was ascertained by giving white mice and rats or coloured mice on
alternate days as often as possible. The time spent in the box by the
male on these feeding visits varied from 2-17 minutes. Factors such as
whether the young had hatched, or their age, seemed to have no effect on
the length of the visit. Occasionally the male would fly to the box
without food, during this sometimes prolonged feeding period.
The method for carrying food to the nest was for the food item to be
picked up in the bill, then gripped in one foot and usually mandibulated,
before being carried to the box. When the adults and independent young
fed, the food was gripped in one foot on the floor of the aviary, or stood
on with both feet and pulled to pieces in the manner of some diurnal
birds of prey. Even very small mice which could easily have been
swallowed whole, were dealt with in this fashion. Only twice so far
have I seen prey swallowed. Both instances concerned young birds, the
amount swallowed was about a third of an adult mouse, after the rest of
the body had been dismembered and eaten.
When the first brood were out of the nest, but not independent, the
male took little notice of their food soliciting. Often he would have food
in his bill and when a chick approached him, he would ignore it and fly in
the box with the food. The soliciting method was for the chick to walk
rapidly along a perch to the male, giving a vocalization. When near the
male, a crouching position would be adopted, the head slightly raised
and the bill opened. Sometimes the male would jump over the chick's
head, landing on its other side, flying back to the box before it could turn
and resume soliciting.

Drinking has been seen six times so far. The bird perches on the rim

head is then raised to the same level as in the " normal " perched posture.
Bathing was observed once, and that was during daylight. The bird

Voice
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9935205" page_id="58076572"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
The most noticeable vocalisation is the " whistling-hiss " call, which is
widely described in the literature as a "wild shriek", "scream",
" screech ", etc. To me it sounds a combination of the hiss that accom-
panies threat displays and a whistle. The call lasts some 2-3 seconds
and is usually a single call. An " extended " form of this call has been
heard, which appears to be three calls " run together."
During observations, only the male has given this call and it does not
seem to evoke any response from the female, or a pair of independent
young housed in a nearby aviary. Although lacking confirmation at this
stage of the study, I am inclined to think that it is only the male birds who
give this call. Sometimes the male would give a very loud " gek-gek-gek ",
the female would respond with the same note. Other adult vocalizations
are a loud " swee-hoo, swee-hoo " and snoring notes which cannot be
distinguished from the snoring notes of the young.
Curious " finch-like " twittering notes have often been heard when both
adults and young are in the nest box. The "whistling-hiss " call is not
given by the young males until they are about 14 weeks old.
Bill-snapping has only been recorded during threat displays, or when
the birds are disturbed in any way. Six days after the first brood was
separated from the parents, I entered their enclosure to change the water
bowl. All three owls dropped to the floor, giving the head-lowered threat
and hissing. After a few seconds, the birds gave a very rapid bill
snapping which had a " grating " sound, very different from the " normal "
bill snap. This peculiar form of bill-snapping has not been recorded
before or since the incident described.
It has been noted that the threat hiss gets progressively louder and
alters in " tone ", according to the amount of pressure to which the birds
are subjected. The time spent in the aviary and distance between the
observer and birds, or bird/man contact are three factors involved. For
example, when I inspected the chicks, the female hissing would increase
in volume and alter in " tone " until it became a hissing-scream, rather
than a hiss.
Displays
Threat displays are given whenever the aviary is entered, unless the
visit is of brief duration, e.g. less than one minute. Two forms of threat
display can be described. In the first form, the head forward threat, the
gaze is directed at the source of disturbance. The wings are fully exten-
ded and lowered, this posture is accompanied by hisses and bill snaps and
is given soon after the aviary is entered. In the second form, the head is
lowered so that the top of the head and nape are exposed to the observer,
the head is swung from side to side, the wings are extended, but they are
not " lowered " or " drooped ". Hisses and bill snaps are also given.

approached by observer. As can be seen in Plate 3, with the wings
extended and lowered, the dark spots on the primaries and secondaries
are exposed to the observer. It is possible that these dark spots may have
an "intimidation" signal value, within the context of the full head
forward threat display.
An incomplete " food presentation " display was seen on one occasion.
The male had a mouse in his bill and moved the head and body in a
lateral-lateral sway. The head/body movement was alternate, head left,
body right, and so on. These movements were interspersed with circular
movements of the head. His gaze was directed at the female, who was
facing him, but no presentation was made and he dropped the mouse.
Allo-Preening
y _
This occurs frequently in young and adult birds, whether perched or
on the ground. The actor will walk towards the reactor, who often raises
the head, presenting the facial disc. Then the actor usually preens the
feathers of the facial disc, nape and head, also around the bill, the reactor
turning the head to facilitate the preening.

There are some aspects of the behaviour observed which require
further comment. The " orientation " or " focusing " movements
made by the young birds before leaving the nest box are also made
regularly by adults in the early morning, before roosting and at dusk after
leaving the roost. During these orientation periods a third movement is
made; this is the lateral-lateral head lowered motion, which is also seen
in the head lowered threat display. The circular and lateral-lateral
movements were present in the food presentation display differing only
in that the head is " swung " in a larger circle during the " orientation "
movements, than in the display (see Figs. 1 and 2 ). To summarize, it
would appear that similar and sometimes apparently identical movements,
are made in widely different situations.
In the play behaviour of the young birds there appears to be two notable
points. Firstly, the behaviour gives the impression of " inefficient
aggression " and once included an overt aggression act?--bill fencing.
Secondly, some of the preliminary movements are suggestive of a very

Addendum
At the time of writing (March 18th, 1971) the female of the original
pair is incubating 6 eggs. The female of the pair hatched in 1970 is
covering 4 eggs and one chick. The first egg of this clutch was laid on
9th February, when the male bird was 9 months of age and the female 6
months. As with last year's clutches, the eggs were laid every second
day.

Captive breeding of these beautiful birds does not occur very often.
The first recorded breeding seems to be that of Loriculus philippinensis
chrysonotus, a race of the Philippine Hanging Parakeet, at the London
Zoo in 1871 . The Vernal Hanging Parakeet, L. vernalis , was bred in
Germany in 1907 , and in 1908 the Blue-crowned Hanging Parakeet,
L. galgulus , was also bred there. Subsequent to these I can find no
records of breedings until 1960 , when L. vernalis was bred in Denmark,
and in the same year Chester Zoo bred a hybrid of L. galgulus (male) x
L. beryllinus. In 1964 and 1965 L. philippinensis was bred at Tampa,
U.S.A. In 1966 L. vernalis was bred in Calcutta and Denmark, and
L. galgulus in Los Angeles. In 1967 L. p. philippinensis was bred in Bern,
Switzerland; and again in 1968 , when L. pusillus was bred at Wassenaar,
Holland, and L. galgulus in Denmark.
In 1966 some L. philippinensis were imported to Denmark, and I
succeeded in obtaining ten of them. Unfortunately five of these died
during the first month, the post-mortem showing death from pneumonia
caused by a fungus; a disease often found in fruit and nectar eating birds.
A further bird, a female, died in 1969 , and I was left with a pair of L. p.
philippinensis and a pair of what I consider to be L. p. hournsi. The male
of this latter pair died in the autunm of 1970 .
In 1970 both of these pairs showed interest in the nest-boxes, and by
June there were 6 eggs from L. p. philippinensis and 3 from L. p. bournsi.
Most of these were unfortunately clear, but one young one left the nest on
the 2 nd August at an age of 37 days. Like the young of L. vernalis and
L. galgulus it was green in colour except for the rump, which was dark
red, but it showed the characteristic long upper mandible of the species.
Two months later the chin and cheeks had become light blue, and the
front red, like that of the hen.
A pair of L. galgulus , consisting of the old cock and a young one bred in
1968 , nested in 1969 , but I was unable to discover the nest. I was sure
that they had young but these never left the nest. This year ( 1970 ) I
found the nest on the ground in the outdoor flight, just inside the netting
and concealed in the 30 cm. high grass. Some years ago a pair of L.
vernalis had made a nest on the floor of the indoor aviary although there
were several nest-boxes available. The nest of L. galgulus in the grass
contained three eggs, one of which hatched; but the young one only
survived a few days.
I was fortunate enough to see the cock of this pair feed the hen in the
nest, and subsequently the hen feeding the young. During the nesting

period the cock feeds the hen by regurgitating a &apos;whitish, wormlike mass;
and the young are fed in the same way. Another characteristic of these
birds is that the female, at least, carries pieces of leaf, about half a centi-
meter in diameter, to the nest by holding them in the feathers of the back,
just as do some of the lovebirds, Agapcnnis species.
In addition to the above I bred two L. vernalis from one nest an 1970 , and
another Danish aviculturist also bred two young ones.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England).
One of the pleasures of aviculture is the insight which it gives us into i
the behaviour of some birds during their more relaxed moments, which
may be difficult to observe in the wild.
It has recently been possible to watch the Roadrunner, Geococcyx j
californianus, at the London Zoo. This large, terrestrial cuckoo of |
western North America has long strong legs, a long slender tail, and a i
rather heavy head and bill. Its feathers are brown, glossed with green 1
and bordered with creamy-white, and there is bare blue skin around the I
eyes. In repose the bird fluffs up like a football, with the tail drooping, [
and the large head, looking hammer-shaped with the heavy bill and the
backward pointing sleeked blunt crest, resting low on the shoulders.
When active it becomes sleeked and lively, with head and neck extended
forwards and tail straight out behind. It runs with long deliberate
strides and tends to stop abruptly, the tail and crest being simultaneously
cocked up at a sharp angle at the moment it pauses, as though both were
controlled by a single hidden string. At other times the tail tends to
swing a little as though it were only loosely attached.
The Roadrunner's most striking posture is that adopted when it is |
sunbathing. A bird of hot arid regions, it may feel a greater need for
the sun than some other species and seems to respond very quickly to
such sunshine as we get. The posture is shown well in the accompany-
ing plate, taken by David Holyoak.
The feathers of mantle and wings, which usually cover the body like a
smooth rounded shield, open up. The wings are opened away from the
body on the upper side, apparently by a movement of the humeral joint.
The lower mantle feathers are erected up and possibly a little forwards,
beyond the vertical position, pushing up the other mantle feathers above
them. The effect is as though the back of the bird had opened up like a j
box; and revealed within is an unexpectedly small and slender body,&amp;quot;
covered in thin, hairy-looking feathering which may be fluffed a little,
while the raised mantle feathers reveal the feather bases and bare skin at
the upper edge. The general effect would be rather pathetic were it
not for the birds' evident satisfaction in the sunlight, and the sudden j
change to a more substantial roundness as it relaxes to normal posture I
again makes one wonder what other species may be are concealing
beneath shapely mass of plumage.

By Johan Ingels (Destelbergen, Belgium)
In the family of Thraupidae, hybrids between species of the genus
Tangara are rather rare.
The first possible Tangara hybrid was described in 1886 by Sclater
as the Gould's Tanager ( Tangara gouldi ) from a single skin, a so-called
" Rio-preparation " which the British Museum of Natural History
received from South Brazil. It is accepted that this species can be a
hybrid between a Blue-breasted Tanager (T. cyanoventris ) and an Orange-
breasted Tanager ( T. desmaresti ). But the Gould's Tanager may also be a
local form of the Orange-breasted Tanager.
The second possible Tangara hybrid was described in 1927 by Berlioz
as the Arnault's Tanager {Tangara arnaulti). At first, this hybrid was
only known from a single bird, which lived in the aviaries of Dr. Arnault
(France). This bird arrived in France with a shipment of living birds
from South America, and the skin is still conserved in the " Musee
Nationale d'Histoire Naturelle " in Paris (France). However, a second
male specimen was discovered among some Southern Yellow Tanagers
(T. cay ana chloroptera ), collected in the province of Corrientes (Argentina),
by Partridge in 1962 while he worked there for the Museo Argentino de
Ciencias Naturales. It is accepted that both birds are hybrids between
the Chestnut-backed Tanager {T. preciosa) and the Southern Yellow
Tanager (T. cay ana chloroptera).
In recent avicultural literature there is only one report of the breeding
in captivity of Tangara hybrids. In 1967 Mr. T. Zucca, from Rivoli
(Torino, Italy), bred two hybrids from a male Blue-throated Tanager
[T. cyanicollis) and a female Golden-masked Tanager (T. nigrocincta).
This present article is a record of the breeding of two other hybrids
which were bred in 1969 and 1970 by Mrs. Y. Claessens-Claes at Heusden
(Limburg, Belgium). These hybrids, between a male Superb Tanager
[T.fastuosa) and a female Yellow-browed Tanager (T. guttata chrysophrys ),
are still alive and at present both birds are in my aviaries and are in a fine
general condition.
After the winter of 1968-69, the parent birds (at that time still of un-
known sex) were put together in a roomy cage of about 4 ft x 2 ft. x 3 ft-
high, which was placed in a sunny verandah. After some preliminary
 |quarrelling both birds settled down and became very tame. During the
r first half of July, the birds built a nest with dried grass in an iron nest-
basket. On 23rd and 24th July, two eggs were laid by the Yellow-
browed Tanager which proved to be a female, and after an incubation
period of 15 days, two young hatched on successive days.

I 30 JOHAN INGELS--NOTES ON THE BREEDING OF TANGARA HYBRIDS
The young were fed by both parents, mainly with spiders, ant pupae, 1
mealworm pupae, gooseberries and red currants. As the parent birds j
were very tame, they fed their young even in presence of men. The I
young were ringed on the fifth day and after a period of 14 days they both I
left the nest. But one of the young birds died a few days later when it I
was startled and struck the cage wiring and was mortally wounded. When j
19 days old, the remaining young started to eat from an apple and at the I
age of 30 days, it was independent.
That year a second clutch of two eggs was lost when the parent birds I
threw the eggs out of the nest after 10 days of incubation. Both eggs were j
fertilized.
During the breeding season of 1970, the parent birds had a new clutch
of two eggs. One egg was broken during incubation, but another hybrid
was reared from the second egg. When this second young one was
independent the female died without apparent reason.
The colour patterns of both hybrids are alike; they have a coarsely
spotted turquoise-blue look. However, there is a slight difference
between both hybrids; the younger one is more yellowish, while the older
one has a more bluish appearance. This different colouring can be
caused by a difference in sex, as we believe that the hybrids are of
opposite sex. The older hybrid has a more bold " male-like attitude
and was seen feeding the younger one on several occasions. The older
one could be a male, showing the influence of the bluish colour pattern ol
a Superb Tanager, while the younger one could be a female, with the
influence of the yellowish-green colour of a Yellow-browed Tanager in
its colour pattern. The older hybrid is the same size as the parent birds,
the younger one is slightly smaller. The oljd birds are of equal size, as
the male T. fastuosa is a small bird, whereas normally Yellow-browed
Tanagers are a little smaller than Superb Tanagers.
The forehead and chin of the hybrids are black, as in the case of s
T. fastuosa , but the black lores of a T. guttata are lacking. The rest 0!
the head is shining light turquoise-blue. The head feathers have a blacl
centre and a very broad light turquoise-blue edge, which gives the head &lt;
slightly scaled appearance. The feathers of the mantle are black with*
small edge of yellowish-green, which gives the mantle a nice spottec
look. The rump and upper tail-coverts are yellowish-green. The tai
feathers are black, edged with greenish-blue. The primary fhgh
feathers are edged with greenish-blue, but the inner secondary high
feathers are edged with turquoise-blue, so that the edges of the fligh
feathers slowly change from greenish-blue to turquoise-blue. The oute
secondary flight feathers, which are edged with orange in the case of "
T. fastuosa , are now edged with light turquoise-blue with a tinge 0
orange. The greater and middle wing-coverts are black edged witf
greenish-turquoise blue. The small wing-coverts are light turquoise
blue, like those of a T. fastuosa. The flanks are greyish-green and blue

The breast has a coarsely spotted appearance, as the small feathers are
)lack edged with pale violet-blue. 1 he abdomen is greyish-green,
&amp;gt;ecoming greyish-white at the vent. The under tail-coverts are yellowish-
;reen with lighter edges. The legs are bluish-grey, and the upper
nandible is black, while the lower mandible has a grey patch at both
ides of the base, like the bill of a T. guttata chrysophrys.
The whole look of these delicately coloured hybrids shows very clearly
he influence of the spotted pattern of the female T. guttata chrysophrys.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
One of the questions that arises after a successful aviary breeding is the
aevitable query " has this species been bred in captivity before?" This
5 not as easy to establish as it might seem at first. Reasonable records
dth any details seem only to have been available since about 1884 when
tie publication of the Aviculture Magazine began. Publication on the
abject tends to be rather sporodic, and often lacking in adequate data,
&amp;quot;he following list was originally prepared as a publication for A.S.P.E.B.A.
ut since it is of interest to aviculturists in general it has been suggested
bat it should be included here.
In compiling the following list I have rejected all bald statements that
such-and-such a species has been bred " and the list consists mainly of
hose species for which some sort of permanent account of the breeding
xists. This does not absolutely prove that breeding has occurred, but
lerely lists those instances in which it is reasonable to accept that it is pro-
i ably a true account of what happened.
The abbreviation " A.M" refers to the Aviculture Magazine. The
bbreviation " B.N. " refers to Bird Notes, not the publication of the
i loyal Society for the Protection of Birds which later used this title, but
\0x25A0 ie publication of the Foreign Bird Club between 1906 and 1925.
I have not included the waterfowl in this list since they are adequately
ocumented elsewhere, and the list may also be incomplete where informa-
on on breedings in Zoological Gardens is concerned.

By J. J. Yealland (Binstead, Isle of Wight)
The state of Gujarat in north-western India is situated between the
Gulf of Cambay and the Gulf of Kutch. The ornithology of the- area
is perhaps best known through the work (The Birds of Saurashtra) of
Raol Shri Dharmakumarsinhji; also through Dr Salim Ali's paper " The
Birds of Gujarat " published in the Journal of the Bombay Natural
History Society.
Early in January, 1971, I went at the kind invitation of H. H. the
Maharaja Jamsaheb of Nawanagar to stay at Jamnagar, the city formerly
known as Nawanagar. Here a very extensive collection of mammals,
birds and reptiles is kept. It is composed mainly of indigenous species,
but there is also a large collection of exotic birds, mostly Psittacidae. The
park surrounding the Maharaja's palace is very much an oasis in a
comparatively treeless area and consequently many birds are attracted
to it; it happens also to be a sanctuary for the Cobra and some of the
smaller native mammals. Just outside the walled park a part of the
collection is kept and this is open, free of charge, to the public every
day. Plans have been made for the building of very large aviaries and
other bird and mammal accommodation where native species now seriously
endangered can be propagated and the park itself will be made proof
against such predators as Jackals, the local roving domestic dogs and the
wild cats, so that many more species can be kept free; also there will be a
continuing programme of tree and shrub planting so as to ensure that
as the surrounding country becomes more and more built on and the
few remaining trees destroyed, this reserve will remain in perpetuity.
The palace where I stayed is a vast building started in 1907 and com-
pleted in 1915 during the reign of the famous Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji,
familiarly known as " Ranji " and, of course, renowned as one of the
world's greatest cricketers, but also venerated in Jamnagar as a far-sighted
planner and for his part in bringing prosperity to the area by the building
of docks, a railway, the making of water reservoirs for irrigation and of
roads and many fine buildings within the city. He entertained on a
lavish scale and the palace was built for the accommodation of guests,
being still used for that purpose. The Maharaja's palace stands about
J mile distant within the willed park. The birds most in evidence
around both palaces are the Ring-necked Parrakeets which nest wherever
they can gain access under the eaves. The Rock Pigeon, Columha livia
intermedia, a dark-rumped race, is also common and so is the House Crow,
Corvus splendens, with the Jungle Crow in smaller numbers. The House
Sparrows and pigeons often came inside through the open windows, the
sparrows sometimes coming at meal times to pick up crumbs around the

chairs and the pigeons prospecting for a nesting ledge. In the park the
Black Kites were nearly always about and one pair had its nest in a tree
near the other palace with a nest of the Black Ibis (. Pseudibis papillosa)
some thirty feet above it in the same tree. Koels ( Eudynamys scolopacea)
were always about in the low trees, behaving, as it seemed, in secretive
and conspiratorial ways, as well they might, for they are clever enough to
outwit the House Crows and are brood parasitic mainly on them, their
young being blackish like the crows' own offspring. The Indian Coucal
(Centropus sinensis) was often to be seen; so was the Wandering Tree Pie
(Dendrocitta vagabundci ), and there were always the Common Babblers
in parties of ten or so, searching for food among the fallen leaves. There
were two Pied Hornbills in the park, but these had been released there
some two years previously and were more often heard than seen. The
metallic and monotonous call of the Coppersmith or Crimson-breasted
Barbet was often to be heard and I once saw a Yellow-fronted Pied Wood-
pecker (j Pico ides mahrattensis).
Another of the birds nesting in February was the Purple Sunbird
(Cinnyris asiatica ), the males of which are not purple, but a steely
Prussian blue in the breeding plumage, much like the female (grey above
and creamy-white below) in the eclipse. It sometimes chooses to build
near to human habitation and I found an old nest attached to a hanging
wire inside an open-fronted building near the palace and watched a
female making her nest quite in the open within an open-topped pen
built to house Ratels, attaching it to a dead stalk of a plant at about five
feet from the ground. Another had her nest attached to a plant that was
growing up through some scrap metal lying against the wall of a pavilion
and no more than four feet from the ground; also quite near to where
some men were working each day. The nest being built was worked on
by its owner even while I stood close by and all were, of course, of the
typical pattern which gives them the appearance of being merely some
plant debris tangled with cobwebs and caught up on a twig. In the
evenings large numbers of Common Mynas and Rosy Pastors come in to
roost close by the palace, a large tree within the quadrangle being a
favourite place, but whether the two species roost together in the same
tree I did not find out and perhaps the mynas rested on ledges of the
building. Small parties of Cattle Egrets pass over on their way to roost
and at one place in the park the Fork-tailed Drongos gather on some
overhead wires where for a time they are active in the pursuit of insects
and then, when it is almost dark they go into the trees. One evening
there were twenty-three of them, most going into one group of trees and
a few into another, but whether it is usual for these drongos to roost more
or less communally or whether they do so here became there are few
suitable roosting places outside the park is not known. This species
(Dicrurus macrocercus) is also called King Crow, not because it is black but
because it is a match for crows in spite of its smaller size. It is said to

mimic the calls of other birds and those of some mammals, and so fearless
is it in defence of its nest that other birds such as doves build their nests
close by, thus benefitting from this protection. Out in the country this
drongo was often to be seen perched on the backs of goats and it is a very
agile and acrobatic flier in pursuit of insects.
Common Peafowl, the Indian Roller, Hoopoe, Green Bee-eater, White-
breasted Kingfisher, Red-vented Bulbul, Silverbill, Brown-backed Robin
and Pied Wagtail were all among the birds to be seen about the park. The
Silver-bills, also known as White-throated Munias, were sometimes in parties
of up to ten. Twice I saw the Kashmir Redstart ( Phoenicuros ochrurus
phoenicuroides) and sometimes saw Collared Doves, Palm or Little Brown
doves (Streptopelia senegalensis cambayensis) and the Dwarf Turtle Dove
( S . tranquebarica ). There were, of course, others not definitely identified
including a Tailor-bird, which is quite likely for it is common in suitable
habitat. One night on the road just outside the park a Stone Curlew was
seen in the lights of the car and once a Nightjar on a road. Sometimes
Demoiselle Cranes could be heard flying over at night and sometimes the
cries of Athene brama , the Spotted Owlet, which, like the Little Owl which
it rather resembles, is sometimes active by day. One that I saw near
the palace may have been of a family that had been hand-reared and still
came sometimes for food, though in the main fending for themselves.
Pellets that I saw near a grove of trees in the park may have been from
this owl, though they seemed large for it. The Mottled Wood Owl
(Strix ocellata ) is in this part of India, but whether ever known to be in
the park I could not say. Vultures were often circling overhead, among
them the White Scavenging Vulture ( Neophron percnopterus ginginianus)
the species being also known as the Egyptian Vulture. Of the kites and
vultures the pigeons and parrakeets took no notice, but sometimes there
came what looked to be a species of small eagle and then there was panic.
One day we went to a farm some miles off and as we drew near we saw at
least a hundred vultures around a dead ox. The birds were all Gyps
bengalensis, the White-backed Vulture, and there was some additional
competition for the carcass in that a dog was trying to keep the birds away
but it did not succeed in injuring any of them and as soon as its attention&amp;quot;
was diverted from any one place the nearest vultures rushed in to snatch
what they could. At length a second dog came and there was much
snarling and showing of teeth, but at last the first dog grew tired and un-
graciously withdrew to rest in the shade whereupon the second went for
its meal. This one paid no attention to the vultures and immediately
they realized this they piled in on one another so that even the dog was
almost lost to sight. It was like a rugby football scrum, only worse
because there were many more participants. We had a smelly ringside
view, but the birds took no notice of us, so ravenous were they.
In a tree near the farm buildings were some sleeping Fruit Bats (Flying
Foxes) and on the way to the farm we went off the road to look at a lake

and saw two real foxes--small greyish-brown animals with dark tips to
their bushy tails. They were in dry stony country and in such areas there
were many birds that were, I think, the Short-toed Lark (Calandrella
cinerea), a common winter visitor to this area. There must of course
have been many small seeds lying in the dust, but to all appearances
there was no food in this dry, brown and barren terrain. I saw a pair
of the Ashy-crowned Finch Lark ( Eremopterix grisea) here and another
pair at another similar place. There was also a small crested lark that
might have been Syke's Crested Lark; there was a similar one on the air-
field at Kuwait and in the Gujarati countryside I saw a few others. This
is Galerida deva and is said to be a versatile mimic and songster, so a
favourite cage bird, but I did not see any so kept.
On the lake there were three crocodiles sunning themselves, but these,
like so much else, are becoming scarcer, the skins being in demand. A
Skimmer, two Caspian Terns, Spotbill, Teal and some Cormorants were
there and on other lakes visited at various times during my stay there were
Darters, Great White Egret or Heron ( Egretta alba ) and perhaps the
smaller one ( intermedia ), Pelicans--we saw the Rosy on the coast, but the
Spot-billed is hereabouts too--Shovelers, Pintail, Garganey and Pochard
were seen and the most spectacular sight of all was the enormous flocks
of Demoiselle Cranes, sometimes resting on the banks or islands and
sometimes in great skeins in the sky. A favourite feeding place for these
cranes is the fields where the ground-nuts have been harvested, for
evidently some of the crop is left in the soil. At one lake we went to find
an almost white Demoiselle Crane that the Jamsaheb had previously seen
and as we went in a helicopter we had a fairly close view when at length we
found it. It was evidently not an albino, for it was not a pure white and
the head was a little darker than the rest of the body. For a time it flew
with a normally coloured one, so it was possible to make a comparison in
the same lighting conditions.
The eastern race of Grus grus, the Eastern Common or Lilford's Crane
is also in this area during the winter and some were seen at another place.
In areas of rocky undulating country the Great Horned Owl ( Bubo b.
bengalensis ) breeds, having its nest under rocks or overhanging ledges. I
was shown two nests containing young, one with three and two eggs
containing well formed dead chicks and one with two chicks which had
been tethered by the legs with thin wire. The wire tie was already too
tight and if left on any longer would have resulted in gangrene of the legs.
It is easy for people to find the nests, for the higher rocks are evidently
used by the birds as vantage points and the tell-tale white faeces are
conspicuous, showing that a nest is probably near by. I went later to one
of the nests and found that one chick had wandered off to rest in the shade
of a large Euphorbia bush growing a few yards distant. Pellets from the
vicinity of both nests contained fur and lower jaw bones of some small
rodent, but no sign of bird remains.

J. J. YEALLAND--A VISIT TO NORTH-WESTERN INDIA
Going along a road one day I was particularly pleased to see a Black-
winged Kite and I saw several others at different times. The distribution
of this species, Elanns caeruleus, is very extensive, but curiously enough
Portugal is the only place in Europe where it lives and breeds. Seeing it
again reminded me of a very interesting and enjoyable holiday in Portugal
when I went with Derrick England and others in the rather faint hope of
finding and photographing this Portuguese rarity--and succeeding certainly
beyond my expectations, for we found a nest and excellent photographs
and film were obtained. A species of harrier (Marsh, I think) was
sometimes seen and once we had a fine view of a Tawny eagle. In the
hope of seeing the Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis ?ugriceps) I went with
three companions to Bhatia, near the coast to the south-westward. It
was a long and dusty search, but at length we saw a male in a cotton field.
At the sight of the jeep in which we travelled the bird moved off and
finally flew to settle a mile or so away. Later in the day we found another,
a female, also in a field of cotton, and sexable, of course, by its much
smaller size. Its pale neck against the green of the low cotton plants
made it visible from afar and we managed to get a much closer view of
this one, but, sad to say, a bustard that allows a close approach is not
likely to survive for long. It may already be too late to save this bird from
extinction and the orthodox methods of protection would require an
army of incorruptible guards. An unconventional method, much more
likely to succeed, was outlined to me by the Jamsaheb whose scheme was
to let it be known among the villagers that a reward would be paid to any
village in whose area a bustard was seen and a much larger reward in the
case of a successful breeding. It would be necessary to guard against an
excess of zeal, of course, but it is the only possible plan with a chance of
success, and the people in remote areas where the birds are still existing
are quite intelligent enough to know how to guard against disturbance of
them. We also saw two little groups of Blackbuck totalling nine animals,
and as soon as we were visible to them they raced away at a great speed, as
well they might, for they are chased and shot from landrovers. Even
thirty years ago it would have been possible to see Blackbuck by the
dozen where now there are none or very few. Quite near to the road to
Bhatia at one place some Demoiselle Cranes were feeding and taking no
notice of the traffic, so presumably this was a place w T here they are not
shot at. Near them were two Sarus Cranes and another was seen, also
by the road, some distance further on. The Sarus is not persecuted, I
believe, because of some superstition regarding it and its fidelity to its
mate. Early in the morning as we were going along there were in two
places one or two rails by the road that were, I think, the Blue-breasted
Banded Rail ( Rallns striatus) and while driving over the vast semi-desert
area in the course of looking for the bustards, sandgrouse were disturbed,
but it was not possible to identify them; two or three of the handsome

street of Bhatia there was a Brown-backed Robin, a bird that I sawin several
different habitats. We stayed for the night at a Government rest house
some miles from the town at an ancient village and on arrival there were
greeted with evident delight by two or three extremely bold and agile mice
who clearly connected visitors with food and who cavorted around and
under the table during our meal. I was less pleased to see them
particularly when I found that my bed, in the same room, had a sort of
mini-mosquito net, not long enough to tuck in. I must say I sleep better
when not overrun by mice during the night, but curiously enough after
the meal we saw and heard no more of them. Outside early the next
morning there was a Spotted Owlet sitting under the eaves and Ring-
necked Parrakeets prospecting there for possible nesting sites. On the
way home we saw in thin woodland a Bluebull or Nilghai and we diverged
from the road to look at two lakes, one with a flock of Demoiselle Cranes
on the shore and what appeared to be a White Stork in the distance and
at the other where we stopped for lunch there was a single tern--the
Indian River Tern, Sterna aurantia , I thought, and a Little Cormorant,
Phalao o cor ax ?iiger, but nowhere did we sight any more bustards
. The Red-wattled Lapwing ( Vanellus indicus) was quite commonly seen
in semi-desert, on the rocky banks of streams and even in the black mud
of the docks, and it is quite approachable; the Yellow-wattled (V.
malabancus) was much less common.
There were often shrikes sitting on the wires by the roadside, the
Indian Grey Shrike ( Lanius excubitor lahtora) among them. Around the
high dam some miles to the southward of Jamnagar there were Dusky
Crag Martins ( Hirundo concolor ), the high wall evidently forming the crag-
there were always Swallows about here and also Rock Pigeons, and in a
bush overhanging a nearby stream were nests of weavers, but I did not
see any of the owners. Coming back from this area one day we had a
good view of a pair of Pied Kingfishers (Ceryle rudis): it may have been
their nesting time, for they were mating. On another occasion one was
hovering and diving into the lake, but without any success that we saw
Pied Chats were sometimes seen out in the country and sometimes small
parties of Rosy Pastors; once a quail leading its chicks across a lane_the
Rock Bush Quail, I think. Stonechats and a pale wheatear--perhaps the
Isabelhne ( Oenanthe isabellina)--a\so seen, the former beina the race
Saxicola torquata indica.
We went for a few days camping in the Barda Hills at Keleshwi, a
place where Ranji had a large house and where he entertained guests for
the Leopard shooting. The house is now in ruins and the formerly
splendid garden overgrown. There is, close by, a hamlet with a temple
some 4000 years old which was restored by Ranji. There may still be
Leopards in the more remote and thickly wooded parts of these hills and
perhaps the Sambur Deer. The drive leading to this place from the
main road was several miles long and rough going in places in spite of

being made up for our visit. The camping was not what one understands
by that epitome of life at its most uncomfortable, for the tents were large,
lined with a wallpaper patterned cloth, a carpet on the ground, a bedstead
and an annexe with washstand and so on; also--the greatest luxury of
all--a small tent, one to each dwelling tent, containing a modern lavatory,
the cistern being refilled by one of the numerous servants in attendance.
Meals were taken either on a terrace near the temple or in a dining tent
and it was altogether a delightful place, so quiet and peaceful. A very fine
male Elephant belonging to the Jamsaheb came too, taking three days
for the journey at a speed of about twenty miles per day; this same animal
later took part in the general election, walking sedately about the streets of
Jamnagar with large cloth placards on either side and taking no notice of
all the noisy traffic around it. On special occasions it was gaily decorated
with crayon patterns on its massive forehead. One evening there came
from Jamnagar some thirty or more dancers to perform some of the
graceful traditional dances in the courtyard in front of the temple. A
stream, quite low in February, but a torrent during the rainy (monsoon)
season, flowed by the hamlet and here there was a Kingfisher (Alcedo
atthis ) in attendance on the numerous small fish in a pool by the bridge.
There were two White-breasted Waterhens (Amaurornis phoenicurus ),
Magpie Robins, Pied Chats, a Tickell's Flycatcher, a male Paradise
Flycatcher, a Blue-headed Wagtail (Motacilla flava beema) and the ubi-
quitous Brown-backed Robin. There were Purple Sunbirds, an
unidentified warbler; also, sitting quietly under the bushes by a pool a
small heron or bittern, only visible by its dark hunched silhouette. A
mongoose made its way along the stream bed and a Brahminy Kite flew
over, seeming to us as it did so to drop a stone or something into a bush.
One morning there was a Rufous-backed Shrike (Lanius schach) sitting
outside my tent. In the old days a road led from the house to a square
two-storied tower further up the hill from which the Leopards were shot,
so a car could drive there, but now the road is overgrown and only the
walls of the tower remain, occupied, when I visited it, by two Spotted
Owlets. There were high lamp-posts which illuminated a raised concrete
platform on which a goat would be tethered as bait. In spite of this -
highly organized shooting, the Leopards would then have been in less
danger of extinction than they are now, for they would also have been
undisturbed in these hills and protected, even if for the wrong reasons.
We went to Ahmedabad by the Jamsaheb's private plane and first flew
low over the shallow waters to the north-eastward of Jamnagar and there
we saw a number of Lesser Flamingos--a small number as flamingos go--
and some Rosy Pelicans, White Storks and very many waterfowl and
waders, we passed over the southern part of the Little Rann of Kutch,
but did not see any of the wild asses that still survive there. Unfortunately
it was too dark to see much of the spacious aviaries in the Ahmedabad
zoo where White Ibises and other water birds were breeding, but we did

see the performing domestic pigeons flying as directed by their keeper and
returning to their loft. This zoo is very efficiently managed by Mr
Reuben David and the animal accommodation that we saw was excellent.
New Delhi is a fine and well planned city, its splendid buildings being
well set off by large gardens with trees and the spacious tree-lined streets.
Here in the hotel garden I saw what I feel sure was the large Pied Wagtail
M. maderaspatensis and in the zoo the two large lakes are a resting place
for thousands of wild duck, mostly Shoveler, but also some Pintail,
Gadwall and Pochard. In the trees wild Painted Storks were nesting and
there were some Night Herons, but whether nesting or not I could not see.
Pied and White-breasted Kingfishers, Green Bee-eaters, Pied Mynas and
many other wild birds were about the gardens which are very much a
sanctuary for them.
We went on to Bombay and visited the market there in which birds are
kept in as deplorable conditions as in so many other such markets. There
were cages full of Indian house sparrows which are bought and released
by people who believe that this will be accounted to their credit in the
hereafter, but it evidently does not occur to them that the sparrows
would not be caught in the first place but for them, for nobody keeps
sparrows as cage birds. There was a cage full of Red-headed Buntings,
nearly all males, but it may be that the catchers do not keep the duller
coloured females. There were also Plum-headed Parrakeets, Alexandrine
Parrakeets, including some nestlings and one that was a pretty bluish-
green and another a yellowish-green colour. There was a pair of
the Golden Langur or Langoor, Presbytis geei from Assam. These
dealers sometimes have the Vernal Hanging Parrot ( Loriculus vernalis)
and the blue-throated form of Chloropsis aurifrons, the Golden-fronted
fruitsucker or chloropsis, whereas the one that is most often in the shops
here has a black throat with a mauve stripe on either side--and a slightly
larger bird if I remember rightly. Another interesting bird they some-
times have is the Black-gorgetted Laughing Thrush, sometimes called the
Collared, and much like the Necklaced. Whistler (A Popular Handbook
of Indian Birds) says: " In the Eastern Himalayas the Black-gorgetted
Laughing-Thrush ( Garrulax pectoralis ), an olive-brown and fulvous bird
with a marked black gorget band, is remarkable in having a smaller
counterpart, the Necklaced Laughing-Thrush ( Garrulax moniliger ). Both
are common in the same localities, often joining in a mixed flock ". We
went to see the birds in our member Mr Sane's shop; also those at his
house where he was breeding Splendid Grass Parrakeets and Gouldian
finches. I was particularly interested to see the Rufous-throated Hill
Partridge, ( Arborophila rufogularis ), Wreathed Hornbill and small in-
sectivorous birds such as Yuhina, Ixulus and orioles including the Maroon.
There was not, unfortunately, time for a visit to the Bombay zoo, but
we did look at the museum where some of the bird exhibits are particularly
well and realistically arranged, that of the Lammergeyer especially.

J. J. YEALLAND--A VISIT TO NORTH-WESTERN INDIA
At the old palace within the city of Jamnagar, a rambling complex of
buildings of great historic interest, there is at the end of a raised terrace &amp;gt;i
an open-fronted recess and here along the rafters of the roof the Indian
House Swifts have a number of nests and the birds were constantly flying :
to and from them. This swift is Apus ajfinis and the nests, composed of
feathers and other soft materials stuck together with the birds' saliva, i
were so close together as to be touching one another and it seems re- )\0x25A0
markable that the owners could find their own among the rows all looking j:
so alike. In the outskirts of the city the mosquitoes are troublesome in |
the evening and at night, but in the city one is never bitten by them-- j
perhaps thanks to the swifts. Around the city wherever there were large |
pools of water there would be Black-winged Stilts; they were also in the |
city around the sides of a very large lake.
A few miles to the northward is a place of perhaps a thousand acres, j
only a few feet above sea-level and formerly an island, I think, reached I
only by a raised roadway, and here in the old days there were large numbers j
of the Grey Partridge or Francolin ( Francolinus pondicerianus ) and other j
game birds kept for the shooting, being fed daily with a truckload of j
grain. Now the surrounding area is silted up and perhaps Rozi, as the
place is called, is only an island in the rainy season. There are still j
francolin there in small numbers and some small mammals as well as a j
fine herd of Spotted Deer which come every evening to take food put down i
for them and to drink at a large pond. The most that I saw was 42 with j
some excellent stags among them. The Jackals have now got into the !
area and are sometimes to be seen coming in from the mudflats where, at
low water, they go in search of crabs and other food. Much of the area j
is covered with high bushes and some small trees and at the seaward side
there is an ancient temple with some dwelling houses around it and a |
lighthouse. The House Swifts live here too, in an old tower, and there i
are parrakeets about as well as many other birds, especially about the j
pond. I saw a White-eared Bulbul here. The sea along this part of the
Gulf of Kutch is so shallow that cargo ships must anchor some four miles 1
off and barges take the merchandise to and from the port of Bedi, salt
from the extensive salt pans nearby being one of the main exports.
At low water there is a huge expanse of mudflats teeming with mudfish
or mudskippers ( Periophthalmus) and the feeding place of numerous j
waders as well as the Painted stork, Great White Egret, Spoonbill, White j
Ibis and many others. The Brown-headed and Slender-billed Gulls are I
about this coast and so is the Gull-billed Tern. There are usually in !
winter many flamingos both Greater and Lesser, but for some reason they j
were absent this last winter. Further to the north-eastward the Mangrove j
trees have more chance to grow, for there they are evidently not so much
taken for firewood as they are around Rozi. We flew by helicopter around 1
this area and could see in the Mangrove trees the nests with eggs of the j
Grey Herons ( Ardea cinerea). We also saw among very many other birds j

between fifteen and twenty Crab Plovers (Dromas ardeola) and two
Black-necked storks on another flight further south. Inland over the
flat dry country we saw one Macqueen's Bustard which rose up to pass
fairly near us. Unfortunately the birds, like the women and children in
the remoter villages are very afraid of the helicopter and do their best to
flee from it: the birds are afraid of the aeroplane too, of course, and it is
not so manoeuvrable for following them. On- the homeward journey I
travelled to Bombay by train and at one station late in the evening saw
many of the Common Mynas roosting on the roof girders over the platform
and not many feet above the heads of passengers, so evidently they have
found a comfortable lodging place that the Starling in London has yet to
discover. By mid-March when I came away the weather at Jamnagar
was becoming very hot and so it continues until the coming of the rains
in June, when, no doubt, the countryside is quickly transformed from the
dry and dusty browns of winter to the green tints of spring.

The breeding season of 1971 promises to be much better than the
previous one, probably due to the short winter and the fine weather in
spring and summer. Among the hatches worth mentioning are the
following:
Three Bar-headed Geese ( Anser indicus ), two Lesser Snow Geese
{Anser c. coerulescens), two Pacific Brent Geese ( Branta bernicla orientalis),
and above all, two Hawaiian Geese ( Branta sandvicensis )--the first after a
long period of failures. Furthermore we bred and raised three Cereopsis
Geese ( Cereopsis novae-hollandiae ) and our Trumpeter Swans ( Cygnus c.
buccinator ) for the first time laid two eggs. A female Andean Condor
( Vultur gryphus) hatched after an incubation period of 58 days, and is
now being hand-reared. Three European Eagle Owls ( Bubo bubo) and
three Snowy Owls ( Nyctea scandiaca ) are developing very well under the
care of their parents. We purchased 10 of the rare Black Lory
(Chalcopsitta atra ), a pair of Red Birds of Paradise ( Paradisaea rubra),
and a pair of Wilson's Bird of Paradise ( Diphyllodes respublica) from New
Guinea. Other rare newcomers were four Red-headed Manakins ( Pipra
rubrocapilla ), three Yellow-winged Caciques ( Cassiculus melanicterus), and

A particularly well-attended Meeting which was enjoyed by everyone,
despite the crowded conditions.
The Club was privileged to be given the first showing of a new film
entitled " The Penguin Millionaire " by Mr. Len Hill who gave a most
interesting and, as always, highly entertaining talk about the birds and
mammals of Grand and Steeple Jason Islands. Mr. Hill related how he
came to acquire these two beautiful islands in the South Atlantic and gave a
very amusing description of an eventful return journey, caring for a group
of penguins which he brought back to England.
Members were very pleased to welcome the Chairman's guest, Mr.
Joseph Forshaw, visiting this country from Australia, whose illustrated
monograph of the entire Psittaccine family is soon to be published.
Mr. Forshaw brought with him a few proof pages to give members a
preview of this very important publication.
Please Note
The next meeting will be held on Saturday, 25th September at
Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water, by kind invitation of Mr. Len Hill.
A buffet lunch will be available at 12.45 p.m. tickets for which must
be purchased in advance from the Hon. Secretary. In the afternoon
films will be shown in the lecture room. Details will shortly be sent
to all members of the Club.

The California Condor Survey, 1970, proved a little disappointing.
Probably on account of the poor weather only 28 sightings were recorded.
The figures for the previous five years are: 1965, 38: 1966, 51: 1967, 46:

Fifty-seven Whooping Cranes arrived at the Aransas National Wildlife
Refuge, Texas, last autumn. They consisted of 51 adults and six
young birds--an increase of one on the 1969 totals of 48 and 8 respectively.
There are now 14 Cranes at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center,
Maryland: 12 of them from eggs collected in the wild.

Some years ago it was suggested that artificial insemination in captivity-
held stocks of some endangered pheasant species might help increase
numbers, but the idea was deemed to be impracticable. Now Professor
Tom J. Cade, Research Director, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology,
Ithaca, New York, has announced the successful hatching of a Red-
tailed Hawk from an artifically inseminated egg.

the unsuccessful nesting of a pair of Lemon-breasted Canaries Serinus
citrinipectus in one of his aviaries in 1969. He says it has been bred on a
number of occasions and was, in fact, bred in captivity before it was
described as a species new to science in i960.

Guilding's Amazona Parrot Amazona guildingii , of St. Vincent, West
Indies, is listed as an endangered species. It is believed to be decreasing
in number but reliable estimates of population are not available. There
are certainly very few in captivity. There are but three in the U.S.A.,
held by the zoos of Brookfield, Bronx, and Houston. In a co-operative
breeding effort Brookfield has now lent its bird to Houston. Both birds
are quite young and it is believed they may be of opposite sex. Time
alone will tell.

In the autumn of 1961 a pair of Corncrakes that had been hand-reared
by our Member, H. F. Gruber, was presented by him to the Royal
Zoological Society of Scotland. T. he following year six eggs were laid
and six young ones were duly hatched, Unfortunately, disturbance
caused the death of four and only two were fully reared--the first record
of Corncrakes breeding in a Zoological Park. In 1963 and 1964 further
young, some by home-bred birds, were reared. But now the last
survivor of the little colony has died.

We have become accustomed, and indeed expect, to see pictures in the
daily press of birds' nests decorated with things fanciful, especially with
items such as mottos, wrappings, etc. off Christmas crackers and such
like. But nesting birds do use many seemingly weird and wonderful
materials. Junior members of the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds have carefully observed nesting birds and have found nests that
have contained such oddments as sweet papers, parts of potato crisp
packets, string, cellophane tape, pieces of polythene, cine film, and even
thin wire, electric cable, and various other items.

In 1946, the late Sydney Porter caused quite an avicultural sensation by
breeding the Kea Nestor notahilis. Since then there have been several
3ther successful breeders, notably the San Diego Zoo where a pair produced
20 young between 1958 and 1962. But even they have been eclipsed by
1 very prolific pair at present living in the Zoologisher Garten, Zurich,
where 24 young have been hatched of which 21 have been successfully
reared. Christian R. Schmidt gives a very full and informative breeding
Account in the International Zoo Year Book, 11, 137-140. Incidentally,
.he Zurich Zoo established a longevity record--a female received in
September, 1929, died on 21st September, i960, just a few days more than
}i years.

The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland received its first penguins,
one or two Gentoo and Rockhopper, and four King, in 1914. Since
when it has had innumerable breeding successes. But since 1963 there
were no new arrivals until this year when twelve Rockhopper were
received from Len Hill in exchange for six Gentoo. The 1970 breeding
results in the Gentoo colony were again satisfactory. A total of 53 eggs
were laid in 23 of the 24 nests supplied. Seventeen chicks were hatched,
of which 13 were successfully reared. Of the remaining 36 eggs, ten were
broken, two of which proved fertile: the other 26 were laid in nests
occupied only by female birds.
Eleven King eggs were laid, but only two young were hatched, both
being successfully reared.
The 1970 census shows 76 Gentoo and 36 King Penguins.

The Osprey--Britain's rarest breeding bird--returned to Loch Garten,
Inverness-shire, in 1959* Since then they have been protected by the
R.S.P.B. by every possible means--barbed wire, guarding wardens,
electric warning devices, etc., but despite these precautions the birds have
suffered vicissitudes--eggs broken or stolen by vandals, attempts to cut
down or burn the tree in which the eyrie was situated. But no less than
23 young have been successfully reared in this R.S.P.B. Reserve. This
year two youths managed to climb the 40-foot pine tree and stole the
three eggs, they were caught and charged with the offence. Five other
pairs are nesting in Scotland and it is hoped they will breed successfully,
In addition, eggs have been stolen from four Golden Eagles' eyries in the
Highlands. Other countries have their protection troubles too! Since
1967 the Ornithological Society of Gothenberg, Sweden, has been pro-
tecting a pair of Peregrine Falcons. Prior to then nests had been robbed
of eggs or young for a period of some ten years, but since the protection
began seven young ones have grown to maturity, and only one has been* j
stolen.

PORTRAITS OF TROPICAL BIRDS. By John S. Dunning.

Bird photography has made tremendous progress during the last few
years. A complete representation of a bird's shape and plumage cannot
be expected in a photograph, but the faithful reproduction of colour,
particularly of the soft parts (bill, face and legs) and of certain attitudes can
be excellent and often constitutes a remarkably accurate record. It is,
however, difficult to photograph many species in the wild as it is usually
impossible to get close enough to the subject and to obtain the necessary
conditions of light. Therefore the author adopted the same system
used by Mr. C. Greenwalt in photographing Hummingbirds. He caught
various tropical American birds in mist nets, placed them in enclosures
well decorated with the plants and flowers of their natural habitats,
photographed them and then released them.
The coloured plates are exceptionally good and well reproduced.
They represent 70 species, chosen from the most beautiful of the con-
tinent. The Hummingbirds and Tanagers are particularly interesting.
To give an idea of Mr. Dunning's ingenuity is the case of the Colourful
Puff-leg Hummingbird (Eriocnemis mirabilis ) which was unknown until
he caught it in the Andes of Colombia, while the Scarlet and White
Tanager (Erythrothlypis salmoni) is one of the rarest birds represented in
Museum collections.
As most of the species represented in this book are popular and most
desirable birds for aviculture it will no doubt prove to be of great interest
to our members.

PHEASANTS, INCLUDING THEIR CARE IN THE AVIARY.
By H. A. Gerrits. London: Blandford Press, 1971 (2nd Edition).
Price #2 net.
This book on pheasant-keeping starts out with chapters on general
information, feeding, housing and breeding of pheasants in captivity.
This is followed by a section which deals with the various groups and species
of pheasants, including peafowl, monals and tragopans. As the author is at
pains to point out, not every species is included but I do not think any
that are likely to come into the hands of pheasant keepers in England have
been omitted.
The book is illustrated with 6 colour plates, each depicting several
species. These are adequate rather than superlative but give a good, if
not always flattering, idea of what the birds look like. There are also a
large number of black and white drawings and photographs. The latter

include fine photographs of Temminck's Tragopan, Grey Peacock
Pheasant and Argus Pheasant in display.
The information appears to be sound, although there are some doubtful
statements here and there on certain species in the wild, unless the author
has knowledge not generally available. The usual, indeed almost obligatory,
praise of modern " scientific " foodstuffs are given and, again as usual,
the " mysterious concoctions or ' custards ' mentioned in some of the
older books " are scathingly condemned. However, sceptical old reac-
tionaries will not fail to notice that, balanced though the modern foods
may be, the author advises that they should always be supplemented by
plenty of fresh greenfood and, in the case of the most valuable species,by
such things as minced meat, egg yolk and insects.
The style is reminiscent of the English of the Dutch bulb catalogues.
The author appears either to be unaware of the different meanings of such
words as " species ", " breed ", " genus " and so on, or, which is perhaps
more likely, he has been ill-served in this respect by his translator. All
in all the book, although it may not have the absolute and balanced
perfection of the admired modern pheasant foods, is for the most part,
like some of the condemned concoctions and custards, wholesome and
nourishing.

SEXING AMAZON PARROTS

We have imported a number of Double Yellow-headed Amazon Parrots, and
Peter van Dijk and I examined them for possible clue as to sex. We did the width
of pelvic bone test and came to the conclusion that the birds with the flatter heads
must be the females, and the birds with a more rounded head the males. We
were strengthened in this opinion by comparisons with the African Grey Parrot,
in which one of the differences between the sexes is the flatter head of the female.
Our opinion is the opposite to that expressed by Mr. Smith concerning the sexing
*of these birds in his article on breeding them.
It may also be of interest that we have imported Spectacled Amazon Parrots
and have succeeded in sexing these birds. We first did the width of pelvic bone
test, and when we thought we had a pair we put them in a cage together and noted
two differences. The female is larger than the male; and the bare area around the
eyes is grey in the male and white in the female. L. P. H. A. van Lent.

By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
There is a statue in the grounds of Colombo Museum that used to
mzzle me as a small boy. Its expression used to change. I have never
xmcerned myself as to the identity of the gentleman there honoured
ilthough doubtless a plaque is fixed to the pedestal to acquaint the passer-
by with that information. The thing that aroused my interest in this
;tatue was that a Kingfisher regularly perched on the bronze pate. This
vas a suitable place for him to take stock of his surroundings and to
vatch for the grasshopper, beetle or small lizard that he caught from that
\0x25A0tand. It also served very well as an execution block. Kingfishers do
lot kill by biting their prey as does sometimes a Bee-eater; they have
he habit of whacking their victim into a state of insensibility against any
landy surface on which they happen to perch, before swallowing it whole,
&amp;gt;r what remains after the punishment.
It came home to me after many years when I again visited Ceylon that
he answer to my boyish puzzling about the gentleman's changes of
ixpression lay solely with the agglomeration of excrement and pieces of
iroken beetle that were so liberally spread over his stoical features.
S T elson in Trafalgar Square probably suffers the same indignity from his
ttendant pigeons; but then, he being so much higher in the heavens,
vill get the benefit from England's certain wind and rainfall throughout
he year whereas the gentleman in Colombo has to wait in the main for
he monsoon rains before he gets his wash. By that time his face-pack is
&amp;gt;aked solid.
Kingfishers are interesting people: they are the soul of contrast. Their
olours are usually brilliant but their shapes are oddly bizarre. They are
xtremely particular about their appearance, yet their nesting habits are
qualid to a degree. Their bodies are powerful and their flight usually
wift but their feet are tiny and placed so far apart that being short of
hank they appear unable to indulge the habit which most birds have, of
perching comfortably on one foot. However, I must beware of saying
j hey never do so because they can stand on one foot easily enough to
cratch their heads with the other, and to stretch wing tail and leg to-
ether! Incidentally is it not strange that this latter stretching habit is

D. M. REID-HENRY--THE WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER
common to all birds of whatever family, or diversity of kind and character:)
The stately eagle, proverbially foolish ostrich, the tiny hummers, (even&apos;
I believe, the portly penguin) they all do it. But I wonder about the
poor Kiwi, and other lowly birds who only have the most rudimentar})
of wings and tail?
We have suggested that Kingfishers are not the most sensitive of birds!
in their toleration of dirty nesting arrangements, but the young have the,
remarkable adaptation of retaining their growing feathers in the safety oi
the sheaths until just before they are ready to leave the sordid burrow
which was their nursery. Then they emerge in shining splendour all
at once and the danger of soiling is thus eliminated. It is perhaps asj
well that the young do remain out of sight, for they are an unattractive f
brood of animated gargoyles before their feathers finally appear. Anyone)
who has had the task (and privilege!) of hand-rearing a family of baby
Kingfishers will know just how ugly they can look. But appearances
apart, there are numerous problems attached to the responsibility. True
fish-eaters are perhaps the most difficult to rear if the aim is to give the
natural diet, for this means the provision of a large quantity of freshl)
caught aquatic creatures such as crustaceans as well as tiny fish. (A
large breeding colony of the common guppy might be a very useful
stand-by!) But there are many ways of lightening the burden. A
purchase of herrings, or better still whitebait, from the local fishmonger
regularly, will fill the bill. These can be cut into slivers and easily fed
from tweezers; but depending on the age and developed state of the birds,
there might be difficulty in inducing them to gape. Strips of sheep^
heart and pieces of liver can also be used, this being the easiest method,
Care should however be taken to warm the offering a little beforehand. |
and the addition of small bone fragments must be included , with a very small)
amount of Cod Liver Oil.
The so-called " Wood " Kingfishers are in the main capable of eating
anything living within their ability to catch it. Thus, the little geckoes oi
wall-lizards that are to be found in every house in the warmer parts of thf i
world are very useful as rearing material for birds such as the White-
breasted Kingfisher Hahyon smyrnensis. Half an hour in the morning
out with a butterfly net will produce enough grasshoppers to add " seconc
course " and ensure a varied diet.
The genus Halcyon comprises many species from the Old World, anc
that of which I write has a large geographical range which extends fronr
Asia Minor to the eastern limits of the continent of Asia itself. There
are a number of races with which we need not concern ourselves here. Ii
is a bird which is equally at home fishing from the side of a lake, or catching
lizards in dry savannah type of country. It will sit and gorge itself or
emerging termites as they prepare to fly on nuptial adventure, but ther
everything, even tigers, will avidly take such nourishment! I am told
by some of my African friends that these flying termites are very good

eating. I am prepared to take their word for it and although I have not
tried the delicacy myself, there is no doubt that the food value in these
insects is very high indeed.
However, having reared a nestful of these colourful interesting creatures
to maturity, and having lavished much care and affection on them they
repay one s attention but poorly by human standards. I am sorry to say
they do not become reconciled to an aviary life very easily, and once they
are capable of independent life they show a disappointing reluctance to
continue or enlarge human acquaintance. There are exceptions to this
code of conduct, and I have known individuals who became completely
attached to their foster parents, for as long as the close ties were maintained
but when the wider horizons of semi-liberty were appreciated, a gap in the
association appeared, and they soon acquired that restlessness which no
longer tolerated the confinement of an aviary. They were released.
Quite right too! There is no more unedifying sight than an aviary
inmate who spends his life wanting out " as the Scotsman puts it.
Such restless birds do little to further the cause of aviculture. Such a
case as I now relate illustrates this point very clearly. Some years ago
an obviously newly imported White-breasted Kingfisher was shown in a
small show-cage at the National Exhibition of Cage Birds at Olympia,
London. I watched it for a long time during which it spent its energies
in constantly clinging to the wire cage-front and thrusting its bill through
in vain attempts at escape until the base of the beak began to show wear
and started bleeding. The comments of the public were caustic and
ultimately the bird was taken away. It should never have been put on
show at all!
On the other hand I remember well another individual of this species
who lived in the old tropical bird house at London Zoo for years and
never appeared in the least disapproving of its lot. The only thing
wrong with this bird was that its beak was grossly overgrown.
When Kingfishers are at home in the wild their beaks suffer a great deal
of wear from a variety of causes. The habit of hammering their prey
against a rock or branch inevitably causes the excess growth to shale away
to some extent, but the annual job of excavating a nesting burrow gets rid
of all but the good foundation of horn; and when the task is finished, as
much as half an inch or more has been abraded away. In captivity they
are deprived of much opportunity to rid themselves naturally of excess
growth of both beak and claws as well. So it is incumbent upon the
aviculturist to provide artificial means for the birds either to do the job
themselves; or periodically to catch up the overladen creature and carefully
pare away or file the beak to its proper proportions. I find that a little
observation will disclose a favourite perch or block in the aviary. Then a
piece of sandpaper can be bound into position so that when the bird
' feaks " its beak after a feed, the growth is naturally taken care of, and
the beak keeps in good order.

D. M. REID-HENRY--THE WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER
I once possessed a Pekin Robin, or Red-billed Leothrix, who developed
an under-mandible that was too long, and obviously caused the lively
little creature some annoyance. On that occasion I adopted the sand-
paper-round-the-perch idea and in a very short time the bird had
deliberately rubbed down its beak into proper shape again. I maintain
that this use of abrasive perches will in most cases completely obviate the
disagreeable job of catching up birds that don't want to be caught.. It
does away with all the concomitant distress a nervous little bird is bound
to experience from the attentions of a loving hand wielding file and
clippers.
The White-breasted Kingfisher is a common bird in India and Ceylon
and probably elsewhere in its range too. It advertises its presence not
only by perching on exposed statues, walls or dead trees where its
brilliance commands notice; but at times its loud, whimsying call is
heard and directs the eye to its place of occupation. This is a love call
used in the breeding season, and apart from this there is a loud cackling
call used in flight which reminds the European visitor of a Green
Woodpecker Picus viridis.
The nesting of this species is similar to that of the family in general,
but they are much less particular about the site than some. I know
instances of mud walls of native houses being used. These efforts are
usually wasted because the owner of the house may feel his structure was
not intended to have holes in the walls. He may very likely be a Buddhist
so he will not actively harm the birds, but he contrives to render their
purpose ineffective, and the Kingfishers are made to select another site
for their home.
During my tour of military duty in Ceylon at the end of the last war, I
had regular occasion to visit Police detachments in places other than
headquarters in Colombo. On one such trip to Kandy I found a fallen
tree by the side of the road with a huge bolus of soil around the roots.
Into this a pair of these Kingfishers had dug a tunnel and nesting was
proceeding in a chamber at the end. Another pair used a cavity in the
wall of our vehicle compound in Calcutta and raised their offspring in
sound of all that went on in the fitter's workshop. My father in his .
" Guide to the Birds of Ceylon " (Oxford University Press) refers to a
pair kept in an aviary which raised a young bird in a wooden nest-box
intended for some other birds.
The eggs vary in number from three to six and are, to begin with, the
usual glossy white associated with Kingfishers. They soon however
become soiled and stained.
It is a thing to wonder at that the people who live in England have in the
vast majority never seen a Kingfisher!--and their chances of doing so are
becoming slimmer every year. We pollute our rivers with filth. We
spread poison on our lands which are needed to feed our own exploding
population and we spend vast sums on telling the world that this Utopia-

in-Embryo can lead the way to a better life for all. One wonders, in the
face of so many disappointments in human affairs, whether this purely
conjectural outlook can compare with the promise inside the temporarily
soiled shell of a Kingfisher's egg, which does stand a fair chance of glories
to come. The real tragedy seems to me that most people in the
" civilised " world do not care if they ever see the Kingfisher: their eyes are
well occupied with a television screen, and their pleasure is attended to
when the Bingo man's cry goes out " Eyes down They obey
instinctively, and think not at all about the rivers of the countryside where
once a flash of vivid blue and a thin high piping note made other, more
circumspect eyes look up! Seldom now is that note heard in places
where once it could be guaranteed for a modicum of patience.
The Kingfisher fouls his nest, but that is incidental to the true purpose
for which the tunnel and chamber were dug. Not so the human being
who fouls the environment of all living things in the name of " progress "
or " development " or whatever other alibi he chooses in his selfish greed.
I think again of all the generations of White-breasted Kingfishers who
have sat on the head of the statue in Colombo. There's is no conscious
protest when they bespatter it with ordure. But intended insult to
humanity or not, I concede they have a point! There are signs, welcome
signs, that mankind is becoming aware of some of the damage he foolishly
works upon this world, and it is to be hoped he will devote strenuous
efforts to remedy the faults for which he stands to blame.

(Creatophora carunculata )
By P. B. Brown (Harewood Bird Garden, Leeds, England)
The Wattled Starling is one of the more interesting, and certainly one
of the most unusual members of the no odd species of Starling. Coming
from East and South Eastern Africa, it is often referred to as the locust
bird owing to its fondness for locusts and its habit of following the locust
swarms in great flocks, stopping to breed, regardless of the time of year,
only when the locusts breed, the young being fed on baby hoppers when
they emerge from the ground. If the locusts suddenly decide to migrate,
the attendant Wattled Starlings have been known to leave eggs and young
alike in the nests and move on with the locusts.
Perhaps the most unusual feature about the Wattled Starling is the
seasonal change in the headdress of the male, a habit quite unique in the
Starling family. The male and female closely resemble each other during
the non-breeding season, having an overall plumage of light mouse grey,
paler under the lower belly and vent. The flight feathers are black with
a brown tinge and the wing coverts are creamy-white in colour in the
male only. During the breeding season, these white wing coverts extend
somewhat towards the back and the male loses the feathers on his head,
exposing yellow flesh on the crown through the eye to the bill. The skin
of the forehead is black. Extending from the base of the lower mandible
and upper throat is a pendular lobe of black skin forming the wattle.
This wattle varies in length depending on the age of the bird. With
young birds, the wattle is hardly formed, being only a few millimeters long,
and it is only as the bird gets older that the wattle attains any size. The
wattle of our breeding male reaches halfway down his chest, but he is now
at least eight years old.
It was whilst I was assistant to the late W. R. Partridge at Evesham
that I first became acquainted with these birds. The pair was purchased
in 1963 and whilst I was with him we managed to get them to build a nest *
and lay eggs, but that was as far as it went. For the next three years after
I left there, they got one stage further and hatched young, but deserted
them at around 10 days old and let them die.
In 1969 when I came to Harewood to start the Bird Garden, I persuaded
Mr. Partridge to part with the pair so that I could continue with the
challenge. They were put in an aviary 24 ft. square by an average of
10 ft. high, with a shelter built onto the outside.
In the spring of 1970 I managed to obtain a second pair of the
Starlings. As the Wattled is a highly gregarious Starling, I hoped the
second pair might give the necessary breeding stimulus required. The
four birds have always lived as a group and apart from the occasional

fickering have never fought. During this year the old pair built a
ircular nest of twigs, etc., approximately 5 ft. above ground in the thick
op of a deciduous bush in the centre of the aviary. The hen laid and,
n due course, hatched and brought one youngster out of the nest. The
r oung was well grown but left the nest too early and was promptly returned
0 the nest, but was out again next morning. The youngster could not fly
ery well and spent most of its time sitting on the ground under the bush,
ust a week after first leaving the nest a heavy downpour in the night put
&amp;gt;aid to our hopes and the bird was found dead in the morning.
In 1971 both pairs of Starlings built nests out of the old nest which had
asted the winter. It was renovated and added to until the ball of twigs
vas about 18 inches in diameter. The entrance to one nest faced north
nd the other east, and both entrances were well towards the top of the
lest, somewhat higher than would be in the case of a magpie's nest which
his structure resembled.
The first eggs were laid in April and after incubation of one week they
vere found on the floor beside the nest. Shortly after these eggs were
liscarded the older hen laid again and must have hatched young by
nid-June, for by 26th June strong calls for food could be heard from the
lest indicating young a week or more old. I was not prepared to interfere
vith the nest in any way for the entrance was quite narrow and went along
ji short tunnel before dropping into the nest, so unfortunately one could
lot see into the nest.
On 2nd July two young appeared out of the nest, one a fine strong bird
md the other a very small under-developed youngster, which was imme-
liately replaced but refused to stay in and was found dead two days later.
The other youngster never looked back, spending all its time either in the
lest bush or on the higher branches which the adults used. About two
veeks after first leaving the nest, the youngster was seen to be eating live
ood for itself and hence we could call it independent. At the end of
uly when both pairs of adults were incubating ag?in there were some
igns of agression by the parents towards the youngster so it was removed
Jid taken indoors where it will be kept until next spring.
The egg is very pale blue, covered sparsely with minute brown spots
bout the size of a pinhead. The shell is quite thin and holding a fresh
gg up to the light one can see the yolk. The full clutch is three eggs.
The basic diet of our Wattled Starlings is a proprietory soft food, minced
)eef, apple, and a daily supply of maggots and mealworms. Three
eedings of live food daily when young in the nest.
As described above the Wattled Starling Creatophora carrunculata has
&amp;gt;een bred at Harewood Bird Garden. It is believed this may be a first
uccess. Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
pecies in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate
t once with the Hon. Secretary.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffs, England.) I
The Reddish Hermit, Phaethornis ruber , is found in Guiana, Venezuelall
Colombia, Bolivia and Brazil. T. hose imported into Britain always seerrjl
to come from Brazil.
This hummingbird is the smallest of the Hermits, and is in fact one oil
the smallest members of the family Trochilidae, weighing only 1-9 tell
2*4 grams. The male has crown and centre of back coppery green, rump j
and under parts rufous, with a V shaped patch of black on the lower breast.
The tail, which is graduated, is coppery, outer feathers tipped with
cinnamon, centre pair tipped white or buff. The female is often palei
on the under parts and the black V on the lower breast is not so pro-
nounced. The female I owned had much longer central tail feathers
than the male (which is still with me), but as this male is a young bird, i
these feathers could grow longer when it next moults.
In August 1968, I purchased two Reddish Hermits (one for a friend).
I was rather dubious as to how long these birds would survive, because I
as most hummingbird enthusiasts are aware, Hermits have always been
considered impossible to keep alive for any length of time in confinement, j
These two birds were being fed Super Hydramin and sugar at the time
of purchase, therefore I kept them on this diet for the first fortnight,
after which I slowly persuaded them to take the diet I usually feed to;
hummingbirds; namely Stimulite nectar paste and honey.
Although supplied with an abundance of fruit-flies, neither of these
Hermits showed any interest in them until they had been with me about a ;
month. Once they did start to show interest in the flies however, they
soon became adept at catching them; picking them off any surface with
the tip of the bill, then carrying them around for a second or two before
tossing then in the air and catching them with gaping bill.
Both these birds drank a small amount of water each day. This they
took from their bathing saucers as I did not supply water especially for]
drinking purposes.
After my friend had collected his bird, I caged mine in a box cage,
48 in. long by 16 in. deep by 16 in. high. It lived in this cage until its
death 2J years later.
As this species is so tiny, its metabolism is naturally rapid and also as
this particular species seems to have an acute sense of taste, even such a
small thing as changing the brand of honey one uses, can affect it.
After having this hummer for 20 months, I decided to purchase two
more Reddish Hermits, mainly to prove to myself that my success with
the original bird had not been a fluke. Much to my surprise these two
new birds were most pugnacious towards each other and because of this,

[ reluctantly parted with one of them. The remaining bird I housed in
a. cage next to my original bird, with a glass partition seperating them.
This second bird I kept on Super Hydramin and sugar for some months,
but eventually I tired of mixing a special nectar just for one bird, and
slowly I persuaded it to accept my normal diet. Like the original Herrmt,
this second bird did not show interest in fruit-flies until it had been with
me about a month.
Like all Phaethornis , and indeed Glaucis , Thremtes and Eutoxeres ;
P. ruber moves its tail up and down when on the alert. This tail movement
becomes more pronounced when the bird becomes excited for some
reason or just before the commencement of a display. Sometimes if the
bird becomes exceptionally agitated, it wags its tail sideways as well as up
and down.
The normal song of the male Reddish Hermit consists of one note
r epeated over and over thus: " Sweep, sweep, sweep, swee-e-ep,
&amp;gt;wee-e-e-e-p, swee-e-e-e-e-p ". This song is repeated many times
during the day, but can be heard most often at daybreak. This species
will also sing during the moult; most species are usually silent during
this period. A " Diong, diong " note is also included in this non-display
song. When the bird utters this note, the neck is streched out and
arched, the bill is opened wide and the head is bobbed after each note is
uttered.
On occasions the Hermit will utter a high pitched " Sweep " when
showing aggression to other hummers; this is the only time this particular
note is heard. It is particularly piercing and can be heard from some
distance away. My male Frilled Coquette, Lophornis magnified, is
boused in the cage next to the Reddish Hermit now that the original
Hermit is dead, and if the Coquette flies near to the glass partition, the
Reddish Hermit becomes most agitated and utters this note repeatedly
until the Coquette moves away.
I have always considered the display of the Frilled Coquette and the
Wire-crested Thorntail, Popelairia popelairii, to be outstanding, but the
display of the male Reddish Hermit really has to be seen to be believed.
\s this display does not seem to follow a set pattern, I shall describe each
phase separately.
{a) The Hermit commences to sing its usual song, the tail movements,
however, are much more pronounced and the song builds up to a
crescendo just before the bird takes to the wing.
Once airborne, the display starts in earnest; the tail is fanned and
held erect, the minute feet are held up in front of the body, thus
displaying the down-like vent feathers. The wings beat very much
faster than in normal flight, making a loud drone. The black
breast patch is held away from the body, but I have not been able
to decide whether in fact the fast beating wings cause these feathers
to stand out, or whether the bird itself puffs them out.

1 62 A. J. MOBBS--NOTES ON THE REDDISH HERMIT HUMMINGBIRD
The bird moves its body from side to side in front of the object i
of display; as this can go on for nearly a minute at a time, I find it '
quite remarkable as it must tax the bird somewhat. During this
sequence, the Hermit makes a subdued twittering noise.
(b) The neck is stretched out in front of the body; bill is held open
showing the black and yellow bottom mandible. The tail is
held horizontally and is moved from side to side instead of in the
usual up and down manner. As the tail is moved, so the body is
also; the head is only moved slightly however. This is the most
fantastic sequence of the display as the body is flung from side to
side in a most exagerated manner. Each time the bird moves its
body, it utters the " Dionging " note already mentioned in the |
normal song. As each note is uttered, so the body is flung from |
side to side in perfect rythm.
(c) The Hermit flies in much the same manner as in sequence (a), the I
wing beats however, are not quite so rapid and instead of the bird I
remaining in one position and moving its body from side to side, it j
flies to and fro along a perch, almost touching it with its vent.
This goes on for approximately 20 seconds after which the Hermit
alights on the perch, brings the tail down under the perch and goes
through the actions of mating. Sometimes during this procedure,
the bird will hang its tongue out.
(d) The bird fans its tail to the utmost; bill is opened wide and the I
tongue protrudes approximately one inch. The bird then arches |
its body, bringing its neck down and its tail down until they almost |
meet. As it does this, the body is swivelled round in almost a
complete circle. I find this particular sequence rather difficult
to describe, but if the reader holds his hand out, then opens and
closes it, moving it from the wrist as he does so, he will not only get
the action of this particular sequence, but will also hear the slapping
noise made by the birds' wings.
The usual sequence of the complete display is normally (tf), ( b ), ( c ), and
(d). However, once the Hermit has commenced displaying, sequence- j
(a) is often omitted and only ( b ), (c) and ( d) repeated.
Female Reddish Hermits also have a song which is very much like the |
male's except that the female never seems to use the " Diong, diong "
note, so often used by the male. The female has no actual display, she |
will, however, sing while perched and will often protrude her tongue at
such times.
In the wild, Hermits take large quantities of insects from rough surfaces.
As it is not possible for me to emulate conditions found in the wild, I find
the birds' top mandible soon becomes overgrown and about every three
months or so, I have to trim this, otherwise the Hermit would find it
most difficult to take flies.

By D. G. Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
Two of the oldest and most beautiful avian residents in the collection,
Gold Coast Touracos, have succeeded in rearing to adulthood one
y fine specimen.
The birds arrived in Jersey in the Spring of i960 after spending three
.rs at Paignton Zoo. They were originally collected by Gerald Durrell
his 1957 British Cameroon expedition, " Peety " the male being taken
a nestling and his mate being obtained as a fully grown female.
&amp;gt; rior to July 1969 the birds were kept with other large softbills in a
y large aviary, and though the female laid many eggs, all were infertile
II for the most part were not even incubated; she often had trouble
sing the egg (37 x 30 mm. average) and frequently had to be placed in
 |hospital cage where she was helped by the additional heat,
dowever since July 1969 the pair have been housed in the Tropical
d House, in a large flight cage with a window in one side. This was
nted " naturally " and contained a large nesting platform high up in
v corner of the cage.
rhree months after the move and after three more infertile eggs, the
jiale Touraco, after 12 years in captivity and after laying dozens of
prtile eggs, finally produced a fertile egg on the 16th October, 1969.
! the 5th November 1969 it was seen that the shell of the egg was
reed. It was assumed the egg was infertile and had merely been
reed by a claw of one of the birds, however, it was seen on close
ruination to have been pierced from the inside and to contain a live
1 moving chick--a most enthralling though totally unexpected discovery.
2 male started brooding as soon as the cage had been serviced. At
) that afternoon he came off to bathe then returned to his duties,
ugh the female had taken his place by 4.30 and she continued to
od throughout the remainder of the day and that night. The
awing morning the female was seen flying about carrying the dead

pink flesh was sparsely covered with black down and the chick ha
greyish-pink legs. Bare skin around the eyes, bill and on the crowd
Lower mandible pink, upper mandible pink with blackish frontal hah
The feet and legs were well developed with noticeable claws, there weij]
also tiny white claws on the alula. The inner membrane of the shell
which was still attached to the chick was quite dry, due probably to til
cracking of the shell after piercing by the chick. This may have constriq
ted the chick, preventing sufficient movement to enable it to free itsell
Still attached to the chick's abdomen were the remains of the yolk sal
containing enough yolk to keep the chick in the egg for a further 12 hou
minimum. The yolk smelt strongly and had been in a dead state f(
some hours. Cause of death appears to have been due to exhaustic
caused by constriction of the rapidly drying inner membrane and perhajl
also to squashing by the cock. Quite one third of the shell was cracke
(externally) and pressed down against the chick.
After this very disappointing setback the female laid seven more egg I
three were infertile, the others smashed.
The next egg, laid on the 10th June 1970 was found to be fertile, bi
was squashed on the 20th June, then finally on the 7th July the successf 1
egg was laid.
The egg hatched on the 28th July, the chick freeing itself at appro:I
imately 12.30 p.m., the female promptly eating the entire eggshell. T 1
chick was first seen to be fed two hours later by the male, who tht
commenced to brood it. When he left the nest at 5.30 p.m., the femaj
approached to take over brooding, but appeared rather disturbed to find!
chick there and threatened it with raised wings. It was quite a long tin
before she could bring herself to cover it, but by 8.30 p.m. she was
place. The chick's appearance matched that of the one described abov
The chick progressed quite well, the adults proving themselves to be ve
good parents despite their inexperience. The rearing diet for the chi ;
appeared to be composed entirely of raisins, grapes, bananas and mesj
worms, all of which were coated in a multi-vitamin solution. A larj
variety of fruit was constantly available to the birds; mealworms we
offered five times a day, approximately 25 were taken at a time. It w
interesting to note that although the female would take them from tl
male, she would never pick them up, consequently all " live food " w
fed by the male. At 13 days old, the chick was covered with thick bla
down and had very short S in. pin feathers showing on wings and ta
The skin of the face was white, the eyes, legs and tip of the bill we
black, the basal half of the bill being whitish. The lining of the mou!
was bright pink. At 21 days old the chick left the nest for the first tin!
it was very agile, though it could not yet fly properly. The plumage w
entirely black, but showed a purple gloss on the wings and tail. T

imson in the flight feathers first started to appear when the chick was
days old, the nodules could also be seen starting to form in the skin
ound the eye, which was becoming lighter. At 43 days old the green
ithers of the adult could be seen emerging through the juvenile
amage. The skin around the eye had also become reddish in colour,
e eye and bill skin remained very dark. The chick had been seen
*ding itself and could now be considered to be self-supporting though
still continued to beg food from the parents. By 7th November the
pearance of the young one was very similar to that of the adults. The
ea of green plumage was not quite as large, neither were the bill or eye
louring the same as the adults, and the skin around the eye was still a
ry dull red; but it had moulted out half of its juvenile flight feathers,
d had grown the beautiful purple wing coverts. On the 20th November
e chick was removed from its parents' cage, primarily to prevent
terference on its part with an egg which the female had laid in the nest
few days before (the juvenile frequently roosted, and spent a large part
the day sitting on the side of the nest), and also to facilitate treatment
r a bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium ) which had been isolated in a faeces
tuple of the chick. The treatment (Chloramphenicol) to which the
ung bird was subjected was completely successful, and the chick is now
fine speciman in full adult plumage.
On the 22nd of June this year our Gold Coast Touracos successfully
tched their second chick which is growing into a fine healthy bird and
now sprouting the adult feathers over its neck and back.
As described above the Gold-Coast Touraco (Turacus persa ) has been
ed at the Jersey Zoo Park. It is believed this may be a first success,
ly member knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great
itain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the
on. Secretary.

By K. R. Semple (Egham, Surrey, England)
I received a pair of Spotless Starlings, Sturnus unicolor , from Spain ju;
over a year ago. In Spain this replaces the Common Starling, S. vulgari
as a breeding bird. In the breeding season the male is glossy jet black a
over, without pale spots. Two or three of the long feathers on the nap!
appear to be raised at times as a little crest. The bill is yellow and lep
and feet are a light grey. The female is duller, greyish-black wit
arrow-shaped white spots on the ends of the feathers. The bill, legs an!
feet are similar in colour to those of the male. After the autumn mouj
both sexes have pale tips to feathers, but although the male undergoes 1
subtractive moult in spring, in which it loses the pale tips, the femai:
retains these pale marks during the breeding season.
Their aviary consists of a flight 14 ft. x 7 ft. x 9 ft. high at the centrJ
A shelter 6 ft. x 4 ft. x 5 ft- is attached. The aviary flight is planted wit I
creepers--various honeysuckles and ivy. The aviary was shared with &apos;
pair of Bourke's Parakeets, a cock White-cheeked Touraco, a hen Fair
Bluebird, a cock Ring Ousel, and several native finches.
The starlings were kept in the aviary from the time when I receive
them. The aviary shelter is heated during the winter months, for th
foreign birds, and the window from shelter to flight is closed every nigh
from the time when the heat goes on in the autumn until the spring
Sometimes the starlings come in at night but at other times they stay 01
in the flight, as do some of the foreign birds. I never force them to go ii^
since there is a polyethylene frame which is fitted on the front of the fligl
from the beginning of the cold weather until the spring.
The birds are fed on a soft-bill mixture which I make up myself; wit
maggots which are given all the year round; and mealworms in smalln
quantities. The last are increased when the birds are breeding.
In May the starlings went to nest. I had put a nest-log in the High
It was about 2 ft. long and 18 ins. round. It was intended for a pair &lt;!
Bourke's Parakeets which shared the flight, but when I realised what wj|
happening I took these out and had to work furiously to erect anothi
flight for them.
On Monday 17th May at about six in the morning I saw the starling
chasing each other around. I did not take much notice at first since
had not seen any mating take place; but on 21st May I saw the hen con
out of the log, and taking a look inside I saw two eggs. On 24th May
found that two more had been laid, making four in all. The eggs wei
a uniform turquoise in colour.
The hen was the only one that I saw on the eggs, and if she had bee
off them for a while the cock would chase her back again. The starling

did not appear to react to the other birds in the aviary unless these tried to
settle on the nest-log, when they were driven off. I did not disturb the
hen during incubation, but on 3rd June when I came home from work and
went into the garden I noticed that the starlings were flying around
continually, so I looked into the log and was pleased to see that there were
chicks.
I increased the supply of mealworms and maggots. They preferred
the mealworms and fed them to the young before beginning on the maggots.
They were also taking worms from the ground. There are a pair of
White-breasted Rails in the same flight and these are provided with a big
bath. They are continually in and out of the water, and the moistened
earth around provides plenty of worms. In order to prevent the young
getting rickets I used powdered calcium phosphate on the maggots. I
if also fed minced meat.
On nth June the young had their eyes open; on 15th June their wings
were well feathered; on 23rd the first young one emerged from the nest,
and on the 25th another two also came out. I never found a trace of the
fourth egg or a fourth youngster. All was going well, but on 27th June my
wife and I went out for the day, and when we came home that night we
found one young one dead, and another was weak and died in the night.
What went wrong I don't know, but the young were on the floor of the
aviary hidden in vegetation and may have failed to attract the parents'
attention.
The third young one had mercifully survived and had the parents' full
attention. It was also fed occasionally by the cock Ring Ousel, Turdus
torquatus , in the aviary. By the end of the first week in July it was flying
well and beginning to feed itself.
In comparison with the young of the Common Starling, those of the
Spotless Starling appear a darker, drab brownish grey, with pale throat
and some white streaking on the breast. The bodies of the two that died
were presented to the Bird Section of the British Museum (Natural History).
As described above, Mr. K. R. Semple has bred the Spotless Starling,
Sturnus unicolor. It is believed this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancashire, England)
A pair of Abyssinian Ground Thrushes were purchased in May 1967,
and housed in one of our glass-fronted compartments with various other j
birds. No attempts at breeding were made during the remainder of that!
year, and none over the following twelve months.
In May 1969 they showed signs of wanting to nest and laid two eggs in !
a wicker nest-basket that we had provided, but after six days both eggs
had disappeared. They made half-hearted and spasmodic attempts at |
building in various places over the following months, but no more eggs
were laid.
During 1970 they again made several attempts at nest-building and
ultimately made a nest of dried grasses etc. on a forked horizontal
branch. The nest never looked really secure and was found on the floor j
one morning with both eggs broken. Some weeks later the cock attacked |
the hen very badly, and she was removed to recover from her wounds, j
which has left her with a small bare patch on her head where the feathers j
have never grown. After three or four months had elapsed we reintroduced
them to each other in another compartment where they settled down quite 1
amicably.
Early this year (1971) they showed signs of wanting to nest again by
trying to build on the branch of a rubber tree (Ficus elastica). A basket
was fixed onto the branch in which they showed immediate interest and
then commenced to build. On this occasion two eggs were laid, these
duly hatched after being incubated for fifteen days. Unfortunately both
youngsters died at about twelve days old.
They again laid two eggs in May, of which one hatched and no sign
of the other egg was found. This was also incubated for fifteen days
and left the nest eighteen days from the date of hatching.
Whilst the eggs were being incubated the cock did his share of sitting,!
but when they hatched the hen very rarely left the nest and was herself
fed by the cock. He was seen to feed the young himself after a period of
approximately ten days. The young bird has the typical mottled markings
of immature thrushes and the white wing bars and eye ring, so noticeable
in the adult birds, is quite pronounced.
As described above the Abyssinian Ground-Thrush (Geokichla piaggiae )
has been bred at Winged World, Heysham, Lancashire. It is believed
this may be a first success. Any member knowing of a previous breeding
of this species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to
communicate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California)
My very first and wholly unexpected meeting with the Western
Mourning Dove (Zenaidnra macroura marginella ) came many years ago
in midwestern Iowa. Sojourning during vacation from the university
at my brother's parsonage, which stood all alone on a hill at Castle Grove
in rich farming country, I heard for the first time in my life the supposedly
doleful call of one of America's ubiquitous and most beloved denizens of
the countryside--the Mourning Dove, often colloquially called the
I Morning Dove. But to me the long-drawn-out, oft-repeated, and tender
coah-cooo-cooo-coo rang clear and friendly in the hot and humid air of
the July afternoon. The caller, a male of the species, was perched on a
( telegraph wire, the direct rays of the sun shimmering the purplish,
red-iridescent upper side of his neck. He must have been singing to his
mate on a nest somewhere near, for he was alone, no rival being visible
or audible. I keenly enjoyed his smooth penetrating calls--the only bird
sounds to enliven the otherwise still and lonely countryside.
Since taking up permanent residence in Southern California, I have
become a steady observer, admirer, and friend of this very modestly,
mainly brown coloured dove. Daily, almost throughout the year, one
or more Mourning Doves will visit the rear-garden to feed and to drink
in company with some domestic pigeons that thrive there. These wild
doves have become an essential part of the garden scene--natural and
unafraid, always welcomed, and only rarely disturbed by neighbour's
prowling cats. Early last April they built their home in the thick,
protective leafage of an immense old sycamore, at least ten feet off the
ground. Like most wild pigeons' nests, it is a frail affair of sticks and
&amp; straws; still, it serves its purpose quite admirably, the luscious greenery
F of the sycamore keeping it almost totally hidden from hungry crows and
Blue lays that regularly patrol the neighbourhood gardens in search of
food. I am reliably informed that our Mourning Dove will set its nest
also on tops of tree stumps, in overgrown hedges, even on the bare ground
in regions where shrubs and trees are not available. In desert regions the
cholla cactus frequently harbours the Mourning Dove's nest, and very
securely too. Working in my avocado grove some years ago, I discovered
a Mourning Dove brooding a pair of shiny white eggs on a low platform
of sticks, only three feet off the ground but well hidden amidst the long,
deep-green avocado leaves that almost enclosed the nest. According to
some authorities, this dove, upon leaving the nest, should have dropped
immediately to the ground, there to thrash about in more or less violent
contortions meant to distract the intruder's, my, attention. However, in
this particular situation, the dove flew swiftly away and completely out

&apos;
of my view, returning to her nest only after almost ten minutes. Inci- I
dentally, it is asserted that the decoying actions of the Mourning Dove are
a more or less typical behaviour trait of ground-nesting species of birds; \
and it is therefore assumed that this dove was originally and wholly also !
a ground nester.
Mourning Doves are prolific producers of eggs and young, nesting here j
usually from March well into September. In some regions of this
country they appear to nest every month of the year! Each pair covets i
its own nesting territory, which the male guards jealously and defends ,
vigorously. However, in Southern California the Mourning Dove is no J
match for the highly aggressive Chinese Spotted Dove ( Spilopelia chinensis j
chinensis), a somewhat larger dove, introduced into Southern California i
quite some years ago. In point of fact, the latter has driven the former (
completely from many parts of California.
Mourning Dove nests which have not been disturbed during the off- &lt;
season are frequently used again, the male usually carrying a few sticks
and straws to reinforce the old fragile structure, with the female arranging
the " furniture " to suit her taste and convenience. New nests are usually i
completed and old ones repaired within a week or ten days. Young
Mourning Doves fledge at the age of from fourteen to sixteen days.
Though usually fat at this age, they are yet quite delicate, remaining in
the vicinity of the nest for a week or so before venturing on short flights.
During this period of their life, the old male is in full charge of their I
maintenance, the female brooding another clutch of eggs.
As is well known, small seeds of many different wild grasses provide the j
principal diet for the Mourning Doves which thus destroy enormous
quantities of obnoxious weed seeds. One investigator discovered no
fewer than 6,400 seeds of the disagreeable foxtail in a Mourning Dove's
stomach, and another, 7,500 seeds of the yellow wood sorrel! Why, then,
in the light of this pronounced usefulness to agriculture in general, the
Mourning Dove is hunted and classified as a game-bird is not easy to
understand. I can always tell when the fall hunting season commences, |
for then whole flocks of Mourning Doves line the telegraph wires in the
suburbs of our San Fernando Valley, where hunting is prohibited, thus
affording these birds some refuge during this perilous time of their lives;
Keenly enjoyable to me is the flight of our Western Mourning Dove. I
Every day I see at least one pair of these graceful birds winging their lofty
way high above the tallest trees in our Valley, swiftly disappearing from
my view. Their sharp flight seems much more rapid than that of the |
domestic racing pigeon, and much less laborious. With their pointed,
not fan-shaped, tails which distinguish them from any other dove, offering
no air resistance, they dash through the heavens as if they owned them--
and they do to some extent!
In captivity, the Mourning Dove adjusts readily to artificial conditions, j
becoming not only quite tame in a reasonably short time, but proceeding j

to nest and to rear young successfully. For these reasons it is a favourite
with many beginners in the dove hobby. Being classed as game bird, it
may be kept only with the aid of an official game-bird permit. The
Mourning Dove has been frequently crossed with the Common as well as
with the White Ringneck (Barbary) dove, the young at times displaying
surprising beauty of plumage. Thus in my own aviary, a cross between
an ordinary female Ringneck and a male Mourning Dove resulted in a
youngster boasting a plumage of lustrous silver-grey. Pure-white hybrids
also have made their appearance on occasion.

KEEPING DIPPERS

The first young Dippers (Cinclus cinclus) that I received came from a
nest which had been accidentally destroyed by campers. Fortunately
for me they were about five days old when arriving into my hands.
Having previously successfully reared some Kingfishers to maturity by
hand, (the worst job I ever attempted), I had few, in fact almost no,
i qualms about their future diet.
These nestlings were kept warm by the normal type of infra-red heater
frequently used with the young of many kinds of livestock. Initially
i 'their feeds consisted of mealworms, fly maggots and pupae, European
Flour Moth larvae, earwigs, woodlice, spiders and daily supplies of finely
chopped vegetable matter.
This vegetable matter was varied--lettuce, dandelion, cabbage, water-
cress, comfrey, spinach, etc. So many insects fed on by birds and given to
their young contain a high percentage of vegetable matter in raw or partly
I &apos;digested state that it has become a standard procedure of mine to include
such food when rearing any kind of young birds by hand.
With the knowledge that many small crustaceans must be taken by
( dippers in the wild and provide additional minerals and protein, we added
powdered cuttlefish to the maggots; and also used finely pulped or minced
raw fish which we added to invalid and baby food mixtures produced by
Glaxo Laboratories, these being then additionally moistened with milk.
We did not remove the coarser bones from the fish which we prepared,
but the whole was completely ground to pulp (any surplus being dropped,
into our dog's supper). A little bone-meal was added to the food as the
/oung birds increased in size. We hoped that the fish-bones, bone-meal,,
ind the cuttlefish, in their ground state, would constitute an adequate
substitute for the bone and shell material eaten in the wild.
Extra cod liver oil, as provided for babies, was mixed in the food in very
j small quantities (and by this, I mean only drops). This cod liver oil

was also added to mealworms; just a few drops being added prior to
killing the worms for feeding to the young Dippers. If added prematurely, I
the oil kills the mealworm too soon. Presumably the fine film thus
formed over the worm suffocates it. Although they were killed
before use, I have always endeavoured to ensure that such worms are :
well-fed themselves prior to the time when they are offered to nestlings
or adult birds, thus enhancing their nutritional value. Too frequently one
hears of aviculturists storing livefood (maggots in fridges, mealworms etc. II
in tins and jars) without giving them suitable food. After a week or so of
living on their own fat with no nourishment or moisture they must
deteriorate alarmingly in food value and usefulness for one's stock.
With the growth of the young Dippers, their appetites seemed enormous, |
we started using raw and lightly steamed cod's roe, the hard roe composed j
of a mass of tiny eggs, in bulk. There seemed to be no preference shown [1
by the birds when canned hard roe was offered as well. The roe was j
mixed with the softfood, and they must finally have been accepting a
third of their food intake in fish and fish roe.
The plumage at this time was, I feel sure, equal to that of a wildling j
of this species. Allowing for the fact that odd faeces which were not passed j
whilst the young were being fed were not removed in time and subsequently j
marked some feathers, they were in extremely fine condition. Certain
factors, however, invited further experiments.
None of the birds which we had, when feeding themselves, ever hesi-
tated in taking our own softfood (Avi-Vite). The mixture we were using |
was, however, vastly different from the standard mixture, as it contained j
much raw fish, fish roe, bone-meal, cut up mealworms, grated cheese,
etc. In adult life their food still contained a wide variety of extra items j
from those previously listed, but this is still the only bird which has not
completely satisfied me as to its suitability for aviary life.
In all cases, after six to eight months, during which time they had
been allowed a bath twenty-four hours a day, they tended to look per- 1
manently wet; yet if allowed a bath for limited periods during each or |
alternate days, they would then appear unhappy after about the same j
length of time. This term " unhappy " is not used sentimentally, but |
to describe their general appearance. Not sick, but in slightly off-peak
form. Experienced bird keepers will know what I mean.
No birds of the first or subsequent broods to be kept were ever lost,
however, each was eventually liberated in natural surroundings whilst
in good health and plumage and well able to fend for itself. They
were released during the summer months. None were retained in
captivity long enough to see their first adult moult completed.
The obvious conclusion is that the cause of the plumage trouble is j
dietetical. Water should in no way have affected them, even from the j
household taps, but we did try rainwater with no obvious resulting j
difference. Had there been pumped running water, I can see no reason j
to expect different results, but a natural stream may well solve the problem.

F. C. BARNICOAT--THE WHITE-BREASTED GOULDIAN FINCH 173
There must be other birdkeepers somewhere with experience in keeping
or studying these birds, perhaps even with theories (or facts) explaining
my failures with this species. It is the only bird which, during well over
forty years of keeping them, has provided me with such a problem; all
others, from Goldcrest to Golden Eagle, having all been kept in good
condition. So I feel that it could hardly be through lack of conscien-
tiousness, or through careless animal husbandry. Any criticisms of my
methods, or any suggestions would be welcome.

THE WHITE-BREASTED GOULDIAN FINCH IN
THE YELLOW-HEAD COLOUR PHASE

I first reported my successful breeding of White-breasted Gouldian
Finches in 1966 in an article published in this magazine the following
year (Yol. 73, No. 4). Since then I have managed to maintain a small
stock of the new mutation, and in spite of much bad luck a limited number
of White-breasted Gouldians has been bred every year, my stud of Goul-
dians now having reached the 14th generation.
The production of a white-breasted bird in the yellow head colour
phase has engaged my attention for five years. Although theoretically
this form might well have appeared earlier, it was not until 1970 that I
was lucky enough to breed two White-breasted Yellow-headed Gouldians,
both males.
The hereditary factor for the white breast is the simple recessive type
and consequently the sex of the mutant is of no significance for colour
nheritance. The only possible matings to be considered with this
nutation and their theoretical expectations are:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.488859583333333">
1. White-breasted mutant (of either sex) x normal giving 100% normal
split mutants.
2. White-breasted mutant x White-breasted mutant giving 100%
White-breasted mutants.
3. White-breasted mutant x normal split mutant giving 50% White-
breasted mutants and 50% normal split mutants.
4. Normal split mutant x normal split mutant giving 25% White-
breasted mutants, 50% normal split mutants and 25% normals.
5. Normal split mutant x normal giving 50% normal split mutants and
50% normals.
Breeding would be greatly facilitated if the normal split mutants were
1 7 isibly distinguishable from the normals, but five years breeding experience

slightly paler breast than normal birds. However, some of my splits!
have the deepest purple chests and have sometimes beaten normal birds
on the show bench.
With matings 4 and 5 above there is only one way to establish which are ]
splits and which normals and that is to test mate every bird. With thel
Zebra Finch, for example, this is a comparatively easy matter; but with
the Gouldian Finch it is otherwise. In the case of this species only onej
generation can be produced per year, so a Gouldian will be at least two 1
years old before its genetic make-up has been proved by its throwing a
white-breasted offspring, or not, when mated with a split or a white-!
breasted bird.
At the best of times the Gouldian Finch proves a vulnerable property.
They must have comparatively soft or thin bones and be prone to taking j
fright at night, because broken necks and skulls far outstrip all other causes;
of death in a species susceptible to several ills and having a comparatively
high mortality rate. Then too I have found Gouldians rather fussy |
about the mate they accept and even more cantankerous about accepting J
a change of mate. In fact I now suspect that the pair bond in this species 1
is a good deal tighter than the general behaviour of male and female
towards each other would lead one to believe, and my experience makes me j
wonder whether a controlled experiment in aviaries might not even show ji
that the Gouldian pairs for life. Man-made pairs of Gouldians often
waste the entire breeding season. Anyway, I found it all too difficult to
prove the genetic make-up of many possible split mutants, and when at
long last the desired information had been gained, the bird would not be ]
reconciled to a White-breasted mate or would succumb to some sling or
arrow of outrageous fortune! I am therefore pessimistic about the value )
of matings 4 and 5 above. With the first three matings given there can
be no doubt about what is being produced and these are the only matings
that are normally worth considering.
The yellow head colour is caused by a gene defect that makes a Gouldian
Finch unable to transform the yellow carotinoids in its food into the red. j|
Consequently in a Red-headed Gouldian the red head-feathers become 1
yellow as does the red tip to the beak. In the case of the Black-headed i
Gouldian with this gene defect, there are no red feathers so only the yellow
tip of the beak distinguishes it from the normal form. The hereditary
factor involved is also simple recessive and the usual pattern, as given
above for the white-breasted mutation, also applies here. To get the
attractive Yellow-headed Gouldian, however, it is necessary to breed the
yellow form of the Red-headed bird.
When I found the white-breasted form reproducing in both red
and black head colour phases in 1966, it was obvious that sooner or later j
the White-breasted Gouldian could be produced in the yellow head colour |
phase. To this end I selected the best Yellow-headed Gouldian hen I
had as the mate for a White-breasted Red-headed cock, and the latter's j

sister, also a White-breasted Red-headed Gouldian, was mated to a
Yellow-headed cock from a different strain. Both pairs bred successfully
and all the offspring were fine looking Red-headed Gouldians which could
be relied upon to carry the factor for white breast from one parent and
for yellow head from the other. Furthermore new blood had been
introduced into the White-breasted stud from two different sources.
In 1968 I was able to put together two pairs of these Red-headed splits,
from which 17 were bred and were remarkably true to the Mendelian
ratios, four were White-breasted Gouldians in the red or black head
colour phase and three were Yellow-headed Gouldians. The latter, in
view of the inheritance laws, were only possible carriers of the factor for
white breast, and in 1969 I set out to test-mate all three. I was only lucky
enough to prove the existence of the factor for white breast in one of these
Yellow-headed birds and he died at the start of the 1970 breeding season.
But while a complete blank was drawn here, one of the white-breasted hens
proved that she was indeed a carrier of the factor for yellow head colour
when she produced a Yellow-headed baby, her mate being a Red-headed
cock definitely masking yellow. This Yellow-headed Gouldian could
be guaranteed to carry the factor for white breast, and I was now
obviously approaching close to my aim. In fact I had been rather unlucky
not to get the white breast and yellow head to coincide in the same bird
in the 1969 season. In 1970, however, White-breasted Yellow-headed
Gouldian cocks were thrown from two different pairs.
Every fancier who has seen these birds has remarked that the yellow
head colour is a trifle lighter than in the normal bird, and closer to true
yellow. This may, however, only be a feature of these individuals.
Perhaps the difference in the tone of yellow on the head will from now on
provide me with as much interest as the blue neck-band does in my
White-breasted Gouldians. This neck-band shows up much more
vividly against the white breast, and it varies considerably in width and in
shade of blue, ranging from sky-blue to almost cobalt. The wider the
blue band the more attractive is the bird, and I should imagine that by
selective breeding it may prove possible to enhance this feature in time.
I benched the first White-breasted Yellow-headed Gouldian on the
biggest show of the 1971 season, the Pretoria Cage Bird Club's Diamond
Jubilee Show, held in July. It was awarded Best Foreign Wild Bird and,
even with the general absence of the more exotic softbills in this country,
this major award was rather a tribute to the beauty and high standard of
this new mutation in the Gouldian Finch. While I do not consider the
White-breasted Gouldian Finch more beautiful than the original gem of
nature, it is a very interesting and attractive variation and, unlike the other
Gouldian Finch mutations that have hitherto occurred, it seems to possess
the stamina to spread widely and eventually come within the compass of
everyday aviculture.

A Member asks the origin of lory and lorikeet. Lory is a name of
considerable antiquity and is apparently derived from the Malayan Luri,
signifying parrot. According to Alfred Newton the name appears to
have been made known first by Nieuhoff, Voyages par mer et par terrc a
differents lieux des Indes , 1682-92.
Lorikeet, the diminutive of the foregoing, was seemingly used for the
first time in 1772.

are that some were released by parrot smugglers when the conditions got

to considerable disturbance in very close proximity of their aviary on the!
same day, the chick was, I think, accidentally killed by the parent birds
who were very likely frenzied by all the unusual noise immediately:
outside their aviary. The chick was ejected from the nest-box by the
parents and found dead on the aviary floor underneath the box."

Listeners to the early morning B.B.C. West Country regional news
were told that a pair of rare birds had nested on Lundy Island but had
deserted their nest on account of repeated disturbance by visitors. They
were described as " Lesser Bearded Stockwells ". The B.B.C. later
admitted that they had been hoaxed, there being no such species.
Some years ago, an eager young newspaper man reported the shooting
T a Remington's Owl. This caused considerable speculation, especially
is the Natural History Museum denied any knowledge of the existence of a
t fird so named. And then, the marksman, who had casually mentioned
:he event in his local inn and who had no idea that his " kill " had
invoked so much interest, announced that the only possible connection
with the name was that he had shot the owl with a Remington rifle.
I once had a flock of about 30 Araucana bantams, originally from Chile.
A.t one time this breed was very popular in the U.S., where it was known as
the " Easter Egg Chicken " because it has the unique peculiarity of laying
pale blue eggs. All domestic breeds when first they start laying eggs are
prone to produce a few " cockneys " or " cock eggs "--a very small egg
with no yolk. And Araucanas are no exception. One year I accumulated
I ibout half-a-dozen eggs, varying in size from that of a sparrow to a starling,
md out of perverse inquisitiveness I sent them to the Natural History
Museum for identification. They were not , however, deceived and quickly
&amp;gt;ent me the relevant information. I have sometimes wondered what the
inswer might have been had I sent the eggs under a fictitious name and
lad not the then Assistant-Keeper of the Department known that I had
) flock of the producers!

AN OFFICIAL DECISION ON NAMES OF PARROT GENERA

Following an enquiry on the subject by one of our members it occurred to me
that others might be interested to know of an opinion published last year by the
International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature on the names of two parrot
genera. The genera which had previously been known as Eclectus and Lorius were
at one time changed by Mathews and Iredale to Larius and Domicella respectively,
for technical nomenclatural reason. These changes were not accepted as correct
by all taxonomists, and there had been some confusion as to the more acceptable
names for these genera. Recently an appeal has been made to the Commission
who have validated the earlier names in place of the later ones; and Eclectus and
Lorius will normally occur in scientific names in future in place of the other two.

PARROTS AND ENGLISH NAMES OF BIRDS

I read with much interest the paper by G. A. Smith, in the May-June issue, on
the use of the foot in feeding among parrots. Such surveys of the occurrence of a
particular behavioural trait are exceedingly useful. Especially interesting are the
findings that the non-prehensile foot seems to be correlated with sexual dimorphism,
small size and seed-eating. It is easy to see how the size of a bird and its food
preferences might well be correlated with use or non-use of the foot in feeding;
the correlation with presence or absence of sexual dimorphism would seem to be
somewhat more obscure. I wonder if the author might comment on the possible
significance of this apparent correlation.
There is a minor factual error on p. 97; Amazona albifrons and A. xantholora
are not allopatric, and cannot be considered conspecific, as both are found in the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and adjacent British Honduras.
Further to the question of English names of birds, especially of parrots, discussed
in several letters in recent issues, I may say that the confusing English " synonymy "
of so many species is precisely what has led ornithologists, notably Eisenmann and
Meyer de Schauensee, to attempt to select a single English name and standardize
it, an effort with which I am deeply sympathetic. I am presently engaged in the
task of attempting to make uniform the names of birds, both English and Latin,
in a forthcoming work on avian biology in which individual chapters are being
written by specialists all over the world. It is a formidable undertaking, and the
work of Eisenmann and Meyer de Schauensee is thereby all the more appreciated.
It is certain that some of the selections of names will seem to some people to be
arbitrary, capricious, unnecessary or inappropriate. This is inevitable in view of
the magnitude of the job. But it must not be forgotten that most of these are
birds for which the English name is not the " vernacular " name, as is suggested by
the heading of Smith's letter in the March-April issue. The true vernacular
names are in Spanish, Portuguese, and various Indian languages, and only in
English-speaking countries can the English name be considered a vernacular.
True, long use by aviculturists has turned some names of birds into quasi-ver-
naculars in English--but aviculturists have been no less responsible for confusion
in names than have the authors chided by Smith (in this connection, see my letter
in Avicultural Magazine, 64, 1958: 153-154).
To cite an example from Mr. Smith's own article and letter, the name " White- j
fronted Parrot" is not a coinage of "Meyer de Schauensee and other recent
authors ' ' as stated by Smith, but has been used consistently in the standard litera-
ture in English on Neotropical birds for over half a century, for Amazona albifrons.
Mr. Smith has a point in stating that "White-capped Parrot" and "White-
crowned Parrot " are unnecessarily confusing (" when is a cap a crown? "). But :
surely there can be no confusion in what is meant by a " front " in ornithological
usage? As an ornithologist working extensively on Neotropical birds, I would have

&amp;gt;een baffled by " Spectacled Amazon " had not Mr. Smith appended the scientific
lame. Granted that other parrots may have "white fronts", and that
' Spectacled " is a perfectly good descriptive name for Ainazona albifrons, it
nust also be pointed out that Ainazona xantholora (which, as pointed out above,
s a good species) is also a " spectacled Amazon It is too much to ask that an
English name not only describe an attribute of the species, but also that this attribute
ie restricted to that species.
I agree that Meyer de Schauensee has gone somewhat too far in applying new
English names in his recent works, but I do not agree that a name, however widely
lsed in aviculture, should take precedence over a name (and a perfectly appropriate
&amp;gt;ne, at that) that has become standardized in the regional ornithological literature.
Dr. Eisenmann is the Chairman of the American Ornithologists' Union Com-
nittee on Classification and Nomenclature, of which I am also a member. This
;ommittee has the duty of preparing the next edition of the A.O.U. Check-list of
^orth American Birds, and has voted to extend its geographic coverage to include
Vliddle America, through Panama. I am sure that Dr. Eisenmann would welcome
suggestions for the improvement of English nomenclature for Middle American
)irds, if some of the ones currently used seem inappropriate. That I do not reject
)ut of hand the names used by aviculturists is indicated by the fact that the state-
nent on p. 212 of Meyer de Schauensee's " Species of Birds of South America "
hat aviculturists usually call Ramphastos dicoloris " Green-billed Toucan " rather
han " Red-breasted Toucan " was inserted at my instance. As it happens, in this
rase I prefer the aviculturists' name!

COLD HARDINESS IN THE KEA AND THICK-BILLED PARROT

I was a little surprised to read the article by G. Michael Flieg in the May-June
lumber of the Magazine, 106 - 107 . I had ample opportunity of watching these
lirds throughout the winter 1970 - 71 , and my experience differs considerably from
hat of Michael Flieg.
The Thick-billed was so miserable that on really cold days it would'nt even
rome out to eat. The Keas were a little happier. I have often wondered why
;ome people like to see their livestock suffer through the kind of winters we have
lere. It is quite surprising that they do not disclose how many birds or mammals
hey lose each year, due to bad and freezing weather. Most of these deaths
xmld be avoided by the provision of proper buildings and aviaries, and by plain
:ommon sense.
The highest mountain in the Thick-billed range is a little over 13,000 feet.
vVhen the weather gets bad in the mountains they descend to the valleys where it is
-varmer. The Kea does stay mostly in the mountains, and some observers even
&apos;.ontend that they rear young all the year round. They live in deep holes where
he body heat keeps them warm and they come out only to feed.
At the Brookfield Zoo the runs occupied by the Thick-billed and the Keas did
lot face north! They both faced west. Wind gusts of 58 miles per hour
iccurred only a few times during the year. One of the Keas, a hen, stayed in the
langing barrel most of the time and would not allow the other two in. The
wo other barrels were on the ground and they did not like them on account of the
ats which went in and out of them.
None of the three baby Keas lived and the odd female was killed by the pair.
Nearly all species of birds and mammals are having difficulty trying to survive
ind I think that everyone should do all possible to see how many can be reared and
lot to take chances that might cause death.

SEXING PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996880803571429" page_id="58076646"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
I am not as sanguine as to the value of the ' pelvic bone test ' for sexing parrots
as Mr van Lent--letter in the July/Aug. magazine.
Over the past three years I have examined over two hundred dead parrots, of s
many different species. Before the carcase is opened I measure the distance
separating the distal extremities of the pubic bones--the pelvic bone test. With
such supple bones and palpated as they are through feathers and skin accurate
measurement is difficult. My own readings are taken with a graduated cone-
shaped device placed over the area betweenlthe bones. Later, during the autopsy,
the true sex of the parrot is made clear.
It has been my experience that the pelvises of females are very much the same
as those of males--unless they have active ovaries, which is not usual with freshly
imported birds, composed as such consignments often are, with a large dis-
proportion of immatures.
Lovebirds ( Agapornis ), Cockatiels and Budgerigars--species that in captivity
have the potential for year-round breeding--are the most accurately sexed by this
method. Where hens, kept in colonies, have about 80% of their munber with
wider pelvises than males. Isolated birds, such as hen budgerigars kept as cage
pets, generally cannot be distinguished from males by this method. It would
also seem, like domesticated poultry, that when ' out-of-lay ' these bones contract
back to a male-like level.
Measurements made on live birds substantiate my doubts as to the value of
this ' test \ Thus, two months before they successfully bred, two male Black-
headed Caiques ( Pionites melanocephela) had pelvic space measurements of 4 mm
and 2 mm. (4 mm is very wide for any male parrot of this general body size.)
Whereas of the females one had the bones actually touching and the other a space
of 2 mm. There can be no doubt as to the correct identity of the birds measured.
I have noticed that with breeding pairs of Amazona parrots--therefore of true
sexual determination---that males are visibly larger and bolder-looking. With
dead Amazon parrots the ones with the wider lower bill measurements are usually
male and those with narrower bills females, however there is much ' overlap ' and
such measurements can be only indicative. Boosey (Avicultural Magazine, Vol.
55, p. 113, 1949), says that Blue-faced Amazons (A. a.aestiva) may probably be
sexed by the red or yellow feathering at the leading edge of the wing. This is
not borne out from examination of post-mortem material. The colouring is
irrelevant.
With African Grey parrots ( Psittacus eyrthacus ) I can find no measureable
differences between the two sexes in dead specimens. When alive males--observed
in breeding and therefore true pairs--sit almost as fluffed out as a frightened
owlet, with beligerance, whereas hens remain sleek. For myself I cannot notice
anything differential about the flatness of the head or the shape of the orbit.
Lastly I am perplexed as to what Mr. van Lent means by ' Spectacled Amazon '.
The reference may be to Pretre's Amazon (A. pretrei ) which has, most confusingly,
been given the vernacular name of " Red-spectacled Parrot " by de Schauensee.
Confusing because it hasn't a red spectacle. Whereas the Spectacled Amazon
(A. albifrons) has a complete red ' spectacle ' surrounding the orbit. A. albifrons
is sexually dimorphic, males have the primary wing-coverts bright red. The
female lacks these. A coloured plate of both sexes may be found, as a frontis-
piece, in Condor 51:2. And good descriptions may be found in E. R. Blake's
" Birds of Mexico ", and in F. E. Smithe's " The Birds of Tikal From a size
point, though it may be incidental, my own male weighs just 10% more than the
female.

I am always happy to read articles about the sexing of identically plumaged
birds, as I think that I probably hold the record for trying to breed from either
two cocks or two hens, although all the usual tests have been applied.

It might be of interest in a light hearted sort of way if I give some factual informa-
ion about these birds. 1 he betting odds are two to one against being right--\0x25A0
\0x25A0Ot great odds or margin for error one would have thought. Some people can not
nlv guess at the sex of birds correctly, but can even pick winning racehorses,
&amp;quot;his latter faculty also eludes me.
n I really started keeping birds in a fairly large way after the war when know-
;dgeable people were thin on the ground. As one might say we spelt the word
xpert with a capital E then.
f My first excursion into the parrakeet world was in 1946, when I purchased an
nmature pair of Cockatiels, and a pair of Peach-faced Lovebirds from Mr. Ted
r ane. Now Ted Vane was a good man with parrakeets, and was the type of man
/ho would not sell deliberately a wrong bird. I feel that aviculture owes a great
ebt to him.
The Cockatiels were a true pair alright, and I still have the cock with me. He
ertainly looks his 25 years of age, but he seems happy enough in a quiet sort of
/ay. He cannot fly, is nearly bald, but still eats well and walks about the floor of
he heated aviary where I keep him. Unfortunately for him I have no other

f &amp;quot;ockatiel at present, but he reared about 110 youngsters and I am glad his old age

 |The Lovebirds were sexed in two ways--firstly the pelvic bone test, and secondly

ny the theory that there was a difference between the eyes of a cock and hen
webird. I spent hours gazing into the eyes of lovebirds, but I think that this
lethod must have been evolved by a Frenchman. My Anglo-Saxon eyes could
[ iever see any difference.
As you may have guessed by now, the Lovebirds were two cocks, so being still
fled with natural awe surrounding an Expert, (spelt with a capital E) I bought
Several guaranteed pairs, but still no luck. Masked Lovebirds were the same,
unally in desperation I sent to Africa and bought three guaranteed pairs of
&apos;Jyassas. These turned out to be four cocks and two hens but as they sorted
hemselves out in a colony, the result was quite satisfactory.
The pelvic bone test was, I believe thought up by Miss Maud Knobel, a charming
idy who kept a large number of parrots in cages, where presumably their sex was
ot very important. Indeed until after the war I believe that parrots were almost
lways kept in cages, and attempts to breed them were very rare.
The general idea was that hen parrots were the larger birds with bigger heads.
The pelvic bone test suffered in my opinion from one basic defect. If one
new that the birds you were handling were of the same age, and if the hens had
-red or not, then it was a fair guess, but if faced with a number of birds of unknown
exual history or age, then it was of little use. To look at it in another way and in
human connotation. If a man from Mars was sexing fully clothed human beings,
11 unisex clothing, as birds more or less are, it would not be difficult to sort out
ome females if included in the selection were a few " Heroines of the Soviet
I Jnion " who had each produced ten or more children, or some other equally free
reeding race. These, I should imagine could quite easily be classed as females by
he pelvic bone test, but I suggest that it would not be so easy sorting out the
thers if included in the batch were some of the charming young ladies one sees on
he 8.46 in the morning, and some of the young males who endeavour to ape the
&apos; smale so successfully.
In 1948 I bought from Mr. Vane, a pair of young Bourke's Parrakeets. The then
/ay of sexing young birds was by the whitish bar under the wing-whole in the
j ock bird, but broken in the hen. As I said, the birds were immature when I got
item and as I knew nothing about Bourke's I was quite happy to see them go into
j he box, but even I, with my reverence for the capital E was a bit dubious when I
)oked inside and found the two birds sitting side by side on 20 eggs. Poor old
ane! he would not believe for a long time that his theory was wrong.
Of course many people will say that they have picked true pairs by such and
uch a manner and be quite serious about it, but having suffered for many years
nder infallible systems, I suggest that one not only needs the system, but a bit of
tck as well.
Behaviour is also a most unreliable guide. In 1959 my son, then doing his
National Service in Singapore, sent me five Yellow-backed Lories. I intended

keeping one pair only, so I thought I would make sure of a true pair. I put them all
together in an aviary and watched them for months. Two birds were always!
together feeding and preening. They were marked and put back with the others;
and watched again. Finally being sure that I had a pair I got rid of the others,
but now, 12 years later, although the birds have been as fit as fleas all the time,;
and play " mothers &amp; fathers " all the summer, I feel certain that they are two
cocks. Had they been a pair they would at least have laid an egg by now.
I have three pairs of " identically plumaged " parrots, and I have had these birds
for about seven years, and feel certain of their sexes.
Blue Fronted Amazon-Cock the larger bird with more blue in the face and the
yellow definitely more golden than the hen. Wing butt reddish in cock,
orange in hen.
Vinaceous Amazon. Blue markings on neck more bluish with cock than hen.
Cock the larger bird. Wing butt red in cock, yellow orange in hen.
Pionus menstruus. Cock definite deeper blue on head, and plumage more of a
golden gloss.
I have not subjected these hens to the indignity of a pelvic test.

In the spring of 1964 Mr. Gerald M. Durrell, Hon. Director of the
Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, brought back from the West Indies
four young specimens of A. ventralis. They were all housed in a fairly
large cage in the tropical bird-house. Two were found to be more
friendly, and the other two more independant. In May 1966 they were
moved to an outside aviary which measured 8 ft longx 4 ft. widex 6 ft.
high. In the farthest corner from the door was hung a nest-box which
measured 2 ft. x 9 in. x 9 in. By the November of the same year one
specimen died and the post mortem results showed that death was due to
carcinoma of the bowel.
Treading by two of the remaining three specimens was first observed
on 14th May 1968. It was now thought that we had one male and two
females, the bird which was thought to be the male had a greater area of
white on the forehead than the other two. On the 26th May 1968 one of
the females was observed to remain in the nest-box; she was later found
to be sitting on three eggs. Incubation was done by her alone, but when
by the 28th June nothing seemed to be happening it was decided to
investigate, and the three eggs all proved to be infertile.
1969 Breeding Season. The second female had to be removed from the
aviary as the remaining two had paired and turned aggressive towards her.
Incubation was again done by female alone and the first egg was laid
on the 5th April 1969. Three eggs were laid, two were infertile and one
fertile, but the chick died in the shell. It had started to cut its way
through the membrane but not the shell, and died after a 30-day incubation.
1970 Breeding Season. The female again produced three eggs and
incubated them, only coming off to feed. She was more aggressive than
he male bird towards the keeper. Alas all three eggs proved to be
nfertile.
1971 Breeding Season. Treading was observed on 20th and 31st March
ind by the 20th April the female began to stay in the nest-box. We waited
intil the 29th April and decided to check the box; if the eggs were
nfertile like the year before we would have removed them and hoped

she would lay a second clutch. On checking the box we found three
eggs, two proved infertile but one was fertile. It was decided to leave i
all three eggs and hope for the best.
Everything went well throughout the incubation, the female sat well
and the male visited her in the nest-box at regular intervals to feed her.
She rarely came off the eggs during the incubation period. On the
afternoon of the 15th May 1971 I was passing the aviary and I heard the
first sounds of a young parrot coming from the nest-box.
Their diet consisted of the following: Sunflower seeds, mixed Canary
seed, Budgie seed, white panicum seed (stopped after four weeks), wheat,
maize, omniviours nuts, peanuts, seeding grasses and hawthorn branches,
apple, orange, banana, pear, grapes, tomato, hard-boiled eggs, and brown j
bread soaked in nectar. All food was sprinkled with carnivours powder |
daily. Cuttlefish and a small quantity of P. Universal Sluis were alsot
given daily.
Normally out of the breeding season this pair of parrots would eat an;
average amount of sunflower seed for their size, but as soon as the chick j
hatched the male almost entirely stopped taking sunflower seed. Instead
he ate a large quantity of mixed canary seed and hawthorn leaves; other!
favourites were hard-boiled egg-yolk, tomatoes, grapes, pear and banana.
Things went well throughout the rearing period and we heard the chick
at different intervals as the days passed on. Sometimes he was not
heard for a few days, and then we began to fear the worst, but the next
morning his little grunting noise would be heard even stronger and we
would give a sigh of relief until his next period of silence.
The female did not come out of the box until the 26th May; at 5.30 p.m.
she was seen feeding, but returned after about an hour. She was not seen
again until the 4th June at 8.00 a.m. and soon returned to the box. After
this she was seen at various times, sometimes spending as much time as
two hours out sunning herself.
On the 30th June the youngster was seen for the very first time looking
out through the hole of the box with the female. It was a great moment
to see the first Amazona ventralis ever to be bred in captivity. From then
on the youngster spent quite a lot of time sitting at the entrance hole. The
sun temperature at the beginning of July was way up in the 9o*F, and
by mid-afternoon I often saw his head hanging out of the box, beak open,
panting with the heat.
At 4 p.m. on the 15th July he actually stepped out on to a branch
about 2 in. from the hole, but being rather unsteady on his legs he returned
after about five minutes; he was now 61 days old. It had taken two weeks
for him to pick up courage to leave the nest-box, but after a week of
leaving the box he would sleep outside in the open with his parents.
The male was still feeding the youngster, who was seen eating peanuts
a week later. The youngster was expected to be a duller version of the
adults in plumage, but instead it was almost identical. The only

difference was where the adults have white foreheads, then an area of
dark blue then amazon green to the back of the head, on the youngster
the area of white on the forehead was slightly larger, there was a tinge of
yellow, then amazon green. Another prominent feature of the adults is
the large patch of vinous-red which decorates the middle of the abdomen,
on the youngster it is more orange than red.
At the time of writing this account (20th August 1971) the youngster
is eating a variety of fruits and seed, a great favourite is the now red
hawthorn berries which are taken in great number.
Although eating quite an amount by himself he still begs his father to
feed him, and being a good father he does.

RAYMOND FRANKLIN--BREEDING THE MALABAR STARLING
BREEDING THE MALABAR STARLING
(,Sturnus malabaricus )
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99170519047619" page_id="58076658"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
By Raymond Franklin (Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England)
I purchased a pair of grey coloured starlings from a dealer in Harrow
during October 1970, and discovered that they were Malabar Starlings,
Sturnus malabaricus. Having no knowledge of this particular species of
starling, I thought they would be something different to try to breed--
as this is my main interest, albeit a lot of work supplying insects, etc!
Some observers say that the sexes are alike as with most of the
Sturnidae, but this is not the case. The cock is a " bolder " bird, silver-
grey on the mantle, wings, breast and lower parts, a handsome chestnut
brown with a white area around the vent towards the tail which tapers
to a brown. As with the Pagoda Mynah the bill is half yellow and half |
blue to the septum; the eyes are blue and the iris white. On the forehead
of the cock are two white spots--altogether quite a handsome bird. The
hen is similar but the chestnut colour is not so pronounced and also there
are no white spots above the forehead. According to Smythies in the
Birds of Burmah, where it is referred to as the Ashy-headed Starling, it
is " liable to be confused with Jerdon's Starling (&lt; Sturnus burmanicus) ",
but I would hardly have thought so as the Jerdon's Starling is somewhat
larger as well as being a different colour.
During the winter of 1970/71 they were kept in my birdroom, with an
average temperature of 45*-5o*, in a flight with various other softbills
(Mesias, Pagoda Starlings, Blue-winged Sivas). There was very little I
quarrelling and the usual diet was supplied (fruit, etc., also proprietary
soft food, maggots) and a drop of vitamin supplement on occasions.
They were put outside in a flight 16 ft. x 6 ft. x 8 ft. high along with a |
pair of Blue-winged Sivas ( Cyanoptera minla) in March 1971. During!
May, a large log was hung high up in the flight. This was a hollow I
length of black poplar ( Populus nigra) about 3 ft. long and 3 ft. in diameter
with a 4-inch hole right through. I blocked up one end and hung it at i
an angle with the open end facing slightly upwards, to prevent any young
falling out.
The cockbird was seen inspecting the hole and running in and out on
the 3rd June. I left well alone mainly because the log is too heavy and
too high up to be tempted to take a look. I tried a torch and mirror but
what a performance this is! Being at work all day the nearest I got to!
observing the proceedings was the sight of the cock carrying green grass
into the log. The hen seemed to be inside for quite long periods so I
surmised something must be happening, but what annoyed me was thal
every time she heard me going to feed the other birds she would rust
to the end of the log to see what was going on. Incidentally, all m&amp;gt;
other starlings behave in this peculiar fashion! At no time was copulatior
observed and there was very little displaying.

The second week of June was very wet and cold, and on the 9th I
found the remains of three pale blue eggs on the ground partially eaten
(by the cockbird?). One had a fully grown embryo. On 15th June
I found two more eggs on the ground and partially eaten. I was begin-
ning to get despondent--with any luck I might breed them one day!
During the third week of June the hen was quiet in the log for long
periods so I presumed things were happening. On 9th July I could hear
faint cheeping and found pieces of eggshell in the flight. Ah! at last.
But all did not go as well as it might have done and on 14th July
I had another minor setback. The hen went sick and could not do her
share of feeding. The cock (stout fellow) did all the work while she just
sat around with her head under her wing. After two days she did not
seem any better so I caught her up and gave her a dose of " Sulpha-
mezathine ". This put her right and she was soon back at work. As we
see everything did not go according to the rules (do we breeders have
rules?). I have a large Terylene net to catch flies, etc. The birds had
these, supplemented with a few mealworms, and two young were reared
successfully. On 28th July out came two fine young. As is usual both
parents worked like mad all the time to supply sufficient live food--and
so did I!
I now have two fine young which I think are a pair and which are doing
well to date (18th October 1971).
As described Raymond Franklin has bred the Malabar Starling,
Sturnus malabaricus. It is believed this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britian or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

(Parc Zoologique de Branfere, Le Guerno, Morbihan, France)
It is already a long time ago, perhaps five or six years, and it is necessary
in the first place, in order to give the background to this story, to say a
few words about Branfere, its inhabitants and the life they lead.
There are in France a large number of so-called Zoological Parks, but
really a very small number, actually only three, that are worthy of this
designation. The Zoo of Thoiry, not far from Paris, which attracts the
largest number of visitors, something like Longleat in England, is
principally based on the exhibition of the most spectacular animals,
particularly the lions and antelopes of its " African Reserve ". There is a
very fine collection consisting mostly of large animals which appear to be

P. JOURDE--THE STORY OF A STRANGE COUPLE
even more numerous than they actually are, for the area in which they are
placed is relatively limited and the density of the animal population is
exceptionally high.
The Park of Cleres, universally known, particularly in England, of
course, needs no description. The number and extraordinary variety of
its inhabitants and more especially the rarest species of exotic birds, have
made it for half a century a focus of attraction without equal; not only for
true ornithologists but, perhaps even more, for the general public who
cannot fail to be impressed by the beautiful surroundings and by the grace
and beauty of the creatures roaming the grounds in apparent freedom.
Conditions at Branfere are rather different, perhaps half-way between
Cleres and Thoiry, thanks to a particularly mild climate suitable for the
acclimatization of exotic animals, and also the variety of its landscape and
the favourable geographical position.
Branfere incidentally has been known since the defeat by Ceasar of the
local ancient Venetes, and the occupation by his army of the area; the name
itself which has been used ever since, is enough to remind one, by a
curious mixture of Roman and Celtic language, of the exploitation of iron
ore which lasted throughout the Imperial period. After a long eclipse
during the Middle Ages, Branfere was to take a new importance in the
area in the 14th century, after the abolition of the Order of the Temple,
long the owners of the land in that part of Brittany. Inheriting its influence
and also the tribute in the fortified church of its Knights, Branfere
gradually emerged from the medieval chaos by replacing its castle of the
14th century by another one much larger of the early 17th century. In
the following century one of its owners for the first time became interested
in nature and created a vast park where he introduced little by little a large
number of exotic botanical specimens, then still exceedingly rare. One
can still see today a few trees planted by him, 250 years ago, the last
remaining testimony to his long and patient efforts. But it was not till
some 200 years later that the present owner started to restore the park,
long neglected, and gradually to reconstitute its vistas and plantations
and repair ruins caused by the French Revolution which almost destroyed
the grounds and the buildings as a result of the hard repressionary measure
taken by " Les Bleus " (revolutionary troops) in this territory of the
" Chouans " (royalists insurgents).
The efforts made by the present owners were not, however, primarily
from the botanical aspect, but rather for zoological interest, particularly
the making of new ponds, which, up to then, had been the weak point of
grounds which had certainly not been established to house exotic water-
fowl, at that time unknown. This endeavour was unfortunately
interrupted by the war, and the animals gathered before were practically
all lost, in the absence of their protectors who were to return only after
an eight years' absence. The difficult situation just after the war made it
impossible to restock this park, which has exceptional possibilities, quickly, j

igi
as it is easy to enlarge and to transform according to needs. The vegeta-
tion is lush and the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean makes the climate
very mild. &apos;I he idea, however, of gathering there animals and birds from
all parts of the world was different from those that inspired the other
two big parks. Far from trying for the great and spectacular show
as at Thoiry, or to collect rare and exceptional specimens as has been
done at Cleres, all those at Branfere were based upon climatic conditions
which, owing to its mildness, permits the gathering of specimens in
astonishing number in complete freedom. The aggressiveness of each
species is much reduced by the relaxing air, despite the proximity of the
Atlantic. Thanks to the very special conditions, a great variety of animals
which, normally, would kill one another, or, at the least, fight, can live
together peacefully in complete freedom, except, of course, on occasion
during the breeding season. Furthermore, many full-winged birds
fortunately enjoy a great area of safety, thanks to a sanctuary of many
hundreds of acres established around the park. But unfortunately it is not
really sufficiently large. It remains, however, that the number and
variety of the creatures at liberty which enliven and decorate the lawns
and parts of the park with their daily activities are the more surprising in
that they behave almost abnormally compared with the conduct under
generally normal conditions.
These conditions are the cause of the present story. Some five or six
years ago, a certain number of Macaws along with other parrots, were
let out, but their reactions and their behaviour, after a first rather normal
I period, proved very different from what was expected. All the Macaws
set free, in that case Blue and Yellow, Green-winged and Scarlet, were
undergoing the first stages of living in excellent friendship. As was
expected, their number, in the second year, started going down little by
little without our really understanding why. They disappeared slowly,
after becoming shyer and shyer, and progressively going away, giving the
impression that they became wilder every day and that nature was taking
over. Such, however, was not the case and it was found out later on that
a pair had been formed. It became obvious that a male Green-winged
"Jerry" and a female Blue and Yellow "Jimmy" had paired up and
did not tolerate any other Macaw around, terrorising them to the point
that they moved away gradually and finally disappeared. This savagery
got worse when, after two years, they started looking for a nesting-place
at the expense of other birds, particularly that of numerous Fan-tailed
Pigeons, part of whose wooden cotes they destroyed ruthlessly to take over

as usual to ask regularly for little offerings of tit-bits. Discouraged,
however, by the lack of success of this first effort, the two Macaws did not
nest the following year, but their aggressiveness did not diminish and
the terrible Jerry continued to attack all parrots kept in aviaries through
his own fault, coming to attack them constantly through the wire-netting
protecting them, managing sometimes to open it to force them to come out,
when he attacked them with the intention to kill, and too often achieving
it, until the day when things changed suddenly. In his destructive- rage,
last spring, Jerry, once more, attacked the wire-netting of one of the few
aviaries (as I said before, they are not numerous as most birds are free),
in order to let out a parrot to try to kill it. It was this time a large species,
a Patagonian Conure, of the larger sub-species, but clearly smaller than an
Amazon. After lengthy efforts, in the absence evidently of a human
witness, of course, the Macaw succeeded in liberating one of the Conures.
It was then that the miracle took place. Instead of rushing at it as he had
always done before, Jerry welcomed the Conure emerging from the cage
with signs of evident satisfaction. His comportment, so clearly shown
for several years, changed from one moment to another: instead of trying to
kill the Conure as it came out, as he always did before, he induced it to
follow him, to fly away with him, which it did willingly and apparently
with complete satisfaction. Their flight, interrupted by halts on branches
and peaceful feeding, lasted several hours and poor Jimmy appeared to
be suddenly completely forgotten; since then she was practically never
noticed. Jerry and the Conure seemed abruptly to have forgotten all that
was not themselves. Heart has its reasons that reason ignores. They
lived and flew together as the pair of Macaws had done until then.
Abandoned Jimmy wandered sadly from tree to tree, always alone, without
ever attracting the attention of her previous mate who had before fought
and killed for her so often. As a consolation, however, and to forget her
loneliness, her affection towards human beings appeared to be reinforced;
she multiplied contacts with them, coming to windows, knocking at the
panes and accepting tit-bits eagerly, with a tinge of melancholy. This]
was going to last a long time, many months. In order to try to find out
whether Jerry's affection with his last fancy was personal, or specific to
these Conures, another one was let out in turn, with all caution imaginable;
it immediately joined the strange couple, shared in their flights and games,
but it was not the case with a third Conure: snubbed, chased by the other
two and the Macaws, it soon disappeared as so many before it.
The three inseparable companions, however, carried on the same life,
keeping away Jimmy definitely. Then came the worst tragedy: she
disappeared for ever! What had happened? It was unfortunately only
too clear: tired of its reproachful presence, Jerry bad executed her,
after so many others. He was not a man, or rather a parrot, to regret a
near past so happy where perfect love had been carried on. He had to
suppress her. So ends the great love of two Macaws which seemed to
have lasted for ever.

(Halcyon senegalensis)
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancashire, England)
The Woodland Kingfisher, which has quite a wide range in South
Africa, is one of the more attractive insectivorous species. They are
approximately eight and a half inches in length, having a greyish head,
neck and underparts a whitish grey, and the upper parts being a greenish
blue. The rest of the feathering is a bright blue with the exception of
the wings and upper wing coverts which are black. The upper mandible
is a bright red, whilst the lower is black. The sexes are alike.
Earlier in the year we put our two Woodland Kingfishers together
for the first time in one of our larger glass fronted compartments, in the
hope that we had a pair and that they would attempt to breed. They
very quickly settled down together, so we assumed that at least we did
have a true pair.
During the following weeks they appeared to be looking for a suitable
hole for nesting. They were seen to enter an old Motmot tunnel that
had been made at ground level, and also into holes that had been made by
a pair of barbets in a rotten log about five feet in height.
The hen disappeared for long periods during the day and we thought
that she must be laying in the rotten log, only to find ultimately that she
was sitting in a plywood nest-box approximately eight inches square, with
a half open front. This had been fixed near the roof of the comp?rtment.
The cock was still seen to visit the rotten log on sporadic occasions, and
was never observed to assist in the incubation of the eggs at any time.
We do not know the incubation period owing to the fact that we were
unaware of the time that she started to take an interest in this nest-box.
After a while we heard noises coming from it, so assumed that they must
have young, and then noticed mealworms being taken to the box by the

cock. We also noticed a certain amount of aggression towards the
other birds in the compartment.
After a week had elapsed we started to give them half-grown locusts
and day-old mice, which were quickly taken up to the nest by both
parents. We continued with this method of feeding until the youngster
left the nest, which was twenty-nine days after we first assumed that it
had hatched. We then cut down on the amount of mice and locusts to
encourage it to partake of our normal daily diet. The young bird was
noticed to be eating mealworms on its own a week after leaving the nest,
and strips of beef about a week later.
There was only one youngster in the nest, and we found no signs of
any other eggs. The box was completely empty and quite clean and dry:
The young bird is slightly smaller than its parents, and in perfect feather.
The bill blackish, and colouring somewhat paler generally, with the
underparts being very finely striped horizontally in black.
As described the Woodland Kingfisher Halcyon senegalensis has been
bred at the Winged World. It is believed that this may be a first success.

(Capita niger)
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancashire, England)
The Black Spotted Barbet is a forest bird of Northern South America
and its size is approximately seven inches. The crown and underparts
of the male are golden yellow paling towards the belly, with black spotted
flanks. Sides of the head, back and wings are black with a yellow band
across the wing coverts. The female is similar to the male but the
yellow underparts are heavily spotted w T ith black.
We unfortunately lost our female last year, so when the opportunity to
purchase a trio came along, we took it, and put both pairs into two of our
glass fronted landscaped compartments.
The pair comprising the new cock and hen started to show an interest
in a rotten log which was only two feet six inches in height. They
started to tunnel downwards and continued to a depth of about twelve
inches, where the tunnel must then have widened out into the nest
chamber, although this could not be seen by looking into the hole.
The first indication that they were actually nesting was when we heard
the young chicks in the nest, as neither of the adult birds seemed to have

een out of sight long enough to incubate any eggs. The parents seemed
ither hesitant in taking food into the nest whilst we were watching,
ut during the thirty-four days nestling period, they were observed to
ike mealworms to them and latterly fruit, mainly sultanas. For the ten
ays prior to the youngsters leaving the nest they were given day-old
lice, these they enthusiastically picked up and took into the log.
Two young barbets left the nest, one cock and one hen, the cock
'aving two days after its nest mate. They both have the individual
larkings of their parents, but the colouring is slightly paler.

BREEDING THE HIMALAYAN BLOOD

ifferent forms of Blood Pheasant, genus Ithagenis. These birds inhabit
ae high mountains of Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Burma, Tibet and China.
Tey are reputed to live at 9,000-15,000 ft. Since 1875, when a pair
/ere sent to the London Zoo, pheasant keepers throughout the world
ave been trying, unsuccessfully, to keep this attractive little member of
h.e pheasant family. All previous attempts have failed. Not only did
: appear to be impossible for these birds to breed in captivity at low
Ititudes: it seemed they could not even be kept alive. The male of the
air sent to the London Zoo last century lived for 14 months, and this
/as the record until 1969-70, when F. E. B. Johnson of Bedford, England,
ept a cock of a pair--the hen died shortly after arrival--alive for
7 months. Several attempts were made to introduce Blood Pheasants
) the aviaries at Cleres, France, earlier this century, but all failed, and
Delacour wrote: "It is, therefore, extremely doubtful whether these
eautiful birds will ever be kept and reared successfully in captivity far
rom their native haunts ".

During 1970 I made two separate visits to the Himalayas--the first
from Katmandu, and the second from Darjeeling--and, as a result of a
total of three months spent at altitudes that the Blood Pheasant inhabits,
I was not only able to study the nominotypical race of Blood Pheasant,
but also to collect wild specimens and import them to England.
</bodyText>

Habits
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987802657894737" page_id="58076666"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
My observations of Blood Pheasants in the wild, at altitudes between
10,000 and 12,500 ft., were confined to the months of February and March,
and to the area of Namche Bazaar and Thyangboche in north-eastern
Nepal. The temperature varied from i2*F at night--i.e. 20* of frost--
to 6o*F at midday. Snow is not usual at these altitudes during this
season, but 1970 was an exceptional year, and during one period at the
end of February there was 2 ft. of snow that lay for almost a week. One
of the more remarkable habits attributed to the Blood Pheasant is
Hooker's report (vide Beebe): " During winter it appears to burrow under
or in holes amongst the snow, for I have snared it in January in regions
thickly covered with snow, at an altitude of 12,000 ft." This thoroughly
incomplete and circumstantial evidence has induced many subsequent
writers to include this as one of the principle habits of the genus. From
my own observations during heavy snow, and from talking to Sherpas,
I would not hesitate to say that there is no truth whatever in this theory.
Apart from the obvious fact that the bird is hardly designed, in beak or leg,
for " burrowing ", there is no necessity for it to dig a hole to evade the
elements. The mountains of this area contain innumerable caves and
overhanging boulders--to which I myself have taken recourse on more
than one occasion--and I have seen Blood Pheasants in these localities,
particularly near fast-flowing streams, in heavy snow. When the weather
precludes their accustomed foraging for feed, they confine themselves to
places which are sheltered and where they can glean sufficient food to
keep themselves alive until the weather improves.
My own observations would lend me to believe that the Blood Pheasant
is nowhere common. In spite of intense searching, I only once saw
two different coveys in one day. The bird has many enemies, though
man (predominantly Buddhist in that region) is fortunately not one.
Snow leopards, foxes and eagles are probably the main predators.
An ornithologist's reaction, on seeing Blood Pheasants for the first time,
will undoubtedly be to note how unlike any other member of the pheasant
family they are. They are no bigger than a French or English partridge,
and their habits are much more akin to partridges than to pheasants.
They were always in coveys when I saw them, usually numbering between
10 and 20, they ran a lot, and called incessantly to each other as they
searched for food. That they seldom take to their wings is certain, and
even when I was driving them into mist-nets they merely ran. The only
time I saw them fly was when they went up to roost at the top of a 20 ft.

ree. Cocks always outnumbered hens, usually by as much as three to
me. I can only presume that there is a heavy toll of hen birds to
vhile in others it is most pronounced. I have examined specimens of the
Tibetan Blood Pheasant Cruentus tibetanus, in which both the breast and
he face are redder than in Cruentus cruentus , and it is my opinion that
he area where my birds were trapped is one where intergrades between
:hese two races are found. I further feel that Delacour's boundary
further west. Another variable feature in cock birds is the number of
spurs. These vary from one to three, not necessarily equal on both legs,
md although one suspects that extra spurs denote an older bird, only
studies of hand-reared birds will provide the answer.
I have never examined the crop of a wild bird, but the food that I saw
them take included the young shoots of coniferous trees and shrubs,
particularly juniper, young blades of millet, lichen, and small insects that
My main impressions of the birds in their natural habitat were, first,
how tame they were, and secondly, of their incessant calling (by both
sexes) that invariably announced their presence. Beebe's account of how
the birds " are remarkably silent " is, therefore, inaccurate.
One other observation that I made, which was of paramount importance
when I later came to breed these birds in captivity was that, contrary to
all previous authorities, the Blood Pheasant does not live at higher altitudes
than any other member of the pheasant family. I saw Monals
(Lophophorus impeyanus) on many occasions, and these were always almost
exactly 1,000 ft. higher up the mountains than were the Blood Pheasants.
Delacour has stated that the inhibiting factor with Blood Pheasants in
captivity is that of disease susceptibility, on account of the high altitudes
at which the birds live. Monals, as is well known, do perfectly well in
captivity, and it was this observation, to which I have referred, which
initially made me suspect that diet, rather than lack of resistance to disease,
was the vital factor in keeping and breeding them in captivity.
me excellent opportunities to study and experiment on the feeding of
freshly trapped Blood Pheasants. Indian Airlines were on strike, so I and
the birds were stranded for almost three weeks at Darjeeling (7,500 ft.).
Eight cocks and nine hens were kept in an aviary at the Zoo, and a variety
I of food--mixed corn, grass cuttings, hard-boiled egg, apples, tomatoes
and bamboo leaves--placed in their pen. It took the birds two days to
get used to the apples (which had to be cut in two, as they seemed averse

to the skins), but thereafter the food which they preferred above all else
was, first, the grass, and secondly, the fruit. Like the Koklass (genus
Pucrasia), they are primarily vegetarians.
The following drugs were given to them in their water during their
transit stay in India:
* (i) Entramin: 1 teaspoonful per 2J gallons.
(ii) Occrycetin (Oxytetracycline): 1 teaspoonful per gallon.
(iii) Vimeral (Vitamins A, B, D, E): 2 teaspoonsful per gallon.
On their arrival in this country, these drugs were continued: Entramin
for 3 days, Occrycetin for 1 week, Vimeral for 3 weeks. Large quantities
of grass mowings were given them in addition to the natural grass in their
pens. I continued to feed them apples, introduced them to mealworms
(to which they showed very little interest), and also gradually accustomed
them to my normal pheasant diet, 50% wheat and 50% specially com-
pounded pellets with a protein level of 24%. For the first month in
England they existed almost entirely on a ration of grass and apples, and
remained in excellent condition. One female died on day 18, and the
post-mortem examination showed liver damage to be the cause of death. 1
The birds were then distributed as follows in my aviaries:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.57875825" page_id="58076668"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
(i) "A"-type Aviaries. Three pairs were isolated (visually) in three J
separate aviaries, where their only communication with other
Blood Pheasants was by voice.
(ii) " B &amp;quot;-type Aviaries. Three pairs were kept in neighbouring
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987429105263158" page_id="58076668"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
aviaries, where they could see their companion pairs on either
side.
(iii) " C ''-type Aviaries. Two pairs (ringed with distinctive colours)
were given the run of three contiguous aviaries, each 33 ft. x 7 ft.,
in which loopholes were left for the birds to pass through to the
adjoining aviaries if they so wished.
These experiments proved of great interest in the spring of 1971. In
the "A"-type aviaries, one hen laid three eggs and then deserted her nest.
The birds in " B ''-type aviaries tried incessantly to get through to their
companions on either side. The birds remained in good condition and
displayed, but no eggs were laid. In the " C ''-type aviaries, each of the
two pairs established its own territory in the two outside aviaries, grazing j
these till the grass was like a lawn. The middle pen remained " no man's
land " and the grass remained virtually untouched. These two pairs were
obviously the most happy of all. Although we never saw them mate, they
displayed frequently and energetically. Occasionally a cock, or cock plus
hen, would sally forth into " enemy territory ". These incursions merely
served to increase the sexual displays, and although a lot of chasing took
place (cock after cock, and also cock after hen) there was no pugnacity

exhibited, such as one would certainly expect from any other pheasant in
similar captive conditions. These two pairs laid a total of 15 eggs, and
on more than one occasion the hens, each of which had entirely different
coloured eggs, laid in each other's nests. The first egg was laid on
20th April, the last on 16th May, and the birds started to moult on
20th June.
As a result of these experiments, and of my own observations in the
wild, I can record that Blood Pheasants live primarily in coveys, that
polygamy and polyandry are practised within these coveys, but that loose
monogamous pair-formations within coveys are the normal practise. The
group, or covey, is certainly the strongest bond of all.
Blood Pheasants are delightful subjects for an aviary. Mine quickly
became even tamer than Tragopans ( Tragopan satyr a) that I collected on
the same expedition. They never mope or sulk at the back of their
shelters as do other members of the pheasant family. They graze with the
avidity of geese, and are continually running around their pens in a most
active and entrancing way.
The display is similar to that of the Koklass. The feathers are puffed
out, the crest is raised, and much chasing takes place. Surprisingly for
such noisy birds, the display is silent. The two pairs in " C ''-type
aviaries afforded us the best observations of the natural display of the
genus. One cock would start to chase and display to his hen. The other
cock would then immediately react and, racing through to the first pair's
territory, take part in the chase which increased to a crescendo, during
which the two cocks would display as frequently to each other as to their
hens.
Delacour states that Blood Pheasants are reputed to drink " only from
running water ". In their natural habitat, all water (except snow) is
" running water ". In captivity they drink from artificial sources exactly
as does any other pheasant.
Breeding
These notes are confined to my own observations of breeding results
at Daws Hall Wildfowl Farm, England, in 1971.
Egg. 48 mm. x 33 mm., extremely variable in colour. My three hens
that laid all laid entirely distinctive eggs. These varied from pale pinkish
buff to deep orange buff, and the markings from minute dark specks to
irregular but large dark brown blotches.
Incubation period. 27-29 days.
Chicks. Since Gronvold's coloured illustrations of chicks at varying
ages in Beebe's Pheasants (1926) and Delacour's descriptions in his
Pheasants of the World (1951) are both inaccurate and incomplete, I feel
that a fresh description of the chick at various stages is called for.
Head and chin creamy-beige. Broad black stripe along crown from
base of bill to nape, broader on top of crown, and broad black stripe from

behind and below eye to nape. Bill vivid vermilion-orange. Body
brown, dark brown band down centre of back, legs reddish ochre.
On close examination, the sexes can be distinguished at io days, the
young cocks being generally darker and showing more grey on the
shoulders.
By three weeks the overall body colour has changed to a mixture of
deep brown and grey, the legs are darker posterially, the stripes across the
head still remain and the bill is still vermilion-orange. Sexes are easily
distinguishable at this stage, the blue-grey feathers on the napes and
shoulders of the cocks contrasting with the warm brown feathers of the
hens. Already the chestnut feathers of the crest are beginning to appear
in both sexes. Pronounced buff stripes have appeared on the upper
breast and flanks, and the whole of the mantle is spotted and pencilled
with light buff.
At six weeks of age, the bill has lost its vivid vermilion colour, and is
much paler. The stripes on the head have vanished, and the young birds i
are now recognisable as miniature editions of their parents. Young hens
are uniformly brown, while the cocks have lanceolate grey feathers as do
the adults. The only red, however, in the young cocks at this age is in the
throat. Gronvold's illustration (in Beebe's Pheasants) of a chick at six t
weeks clearly depicts a young hen bird, though the colouring is inaccurate.
The chicks, like their parents, are noticeably active from the moment
of birth, and delight in jumping on and off the backs of their foster-
mothers.
My breeding results with Blood Pheasants in 1971 are summarised as
follows:
Number of eggs laid 18
Eggs broken by parents/broodies 3
Infertile 2
Died during incubation 4
Hatched 9
Died during first two days 2
Died at four weeks 1
Reared 6
My 1971 breeding results of pheasants were in fact disappointing, and
comparatively few eggs were laid. This was caused by a dietary imbalance
or deficiency, which has now been traced and rectified. Had this not
occurred, I would have undoubtedly had more eggs, and I would suspect
that Blood Pheasants, like Koklass (Pucrasia sps.) are prolific layers.
The rearing of the chicks presented no particular problems. The eggs
were incubated under broody hens and transferred to an incubator for
hatching. The young birds were then consigned to a broody Silkie hen
for rearing. The only awkward moment was when my Dutch assistant,
Gees Stapel, an excellent aviculturist but a very moderate entomologist,
was instructed by me to collect ant eggs for the day-old chicks. He

selected a very active nest of red ants and tipped the whole nest, eggs and
" soldier ants ", into the Blood Pheasant pen. " I wondered why the birds
kept jumping " was his naive retort on receiving a mild admonishment.
The chicks were reared on a diet of turkey starter crumbs, hard-boiled
egg yolk (first two days), mealworms and duckweed (Lemna minor). At
two weeks of age they were put on grass, and it was noticeable, when the
arcs were moved each day, how they avidly attacked the seed heads of the
grasses in their small (6 ft. x 2 ft.) pens. At four weeks of age they were
moved, with their foster-mother, to a permanent aviary with a shelter at
one end.
In the wild, in the mountains of Nepal, I had observed how Blood
Pheasants would quickly react to the presence of predatory birds and
would invariably run (rather than fly) for cover at the first sign of danger.
It was, therefore, of particular interest to observe the innate reaction of
the young chicks to the danger call of the blackbird (Turdus merula).
To the obvious mystification of their Silkie foster-mother, the chicks
. would scuttle for cover beneath a large log in their pen every time they
j heard this call, and remained cowering there until the Silkie called them
out again.
Summary
With only one successful breeding record to draw on, it would be wrong
to be dogmatic. I feel, nevertheless, that the difficulties of keeping
Blood Pheasants in captivity have been greatly exaggerated. Many
pheasant keepers have found Koklass difficult, but we have never---
admittedly I speak from only three years experience with this species---
found that they pose any particular problems. The secret of successful
: aviculture is, surely, to study, either by observation in the wild, or through
literature or, ideally, through a combination of both, the natural habits of
each bird and to try and simulate these as far as possible in captivity.
Blood Pheasants are primarily vegetarians, the covey instinct is strong
with them, and I feel sure that if these two principles are borne in mind
jthese attractive birds can be kept and bred successfully in captivity.
&apos;&amp;quot;That they are susceptible to disease is certainly true, and my own limited
I experience has shown that they have little or no resistance to Histomoniasis
(Black-head) and avian tuberculosis. These two diseases, however, are
iones to which all pheasants are extremely prone. Further research is
|certainly required before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding disease
^susceptibility of Blood Pheasants, and it is to be hoped that a captive stock
of these pheasants can be maintained for this purpose.
As described above, the Himalayan Blood Pheasant (Ithagenis cruentus)
has been bred by Major Iain Grahame. It is believed this may be a first
I success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

(Pionites melanocephala)
By George A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
Black-headed Caiques are small South American parrots of the same
body-size as Ring-necked Parrakeets ( Psittacula krameri). Good illustra-
tions of caiques may be found in Prestwich (1955), Rutgers (1965),
Havershmidt (1968) and Bates and Busenbark (1969). A rough descrip-
tion of these odd-coloured parrots is that they have the back, wings and
tail a clear holly green; chest and belly dirty-white; the base of the neck
tan-apricot; lower cheeks, throat, thighs and undertail coverts orange;
the entire top of the head, bill, legs and periorbital area skin are dull
black. Total length is about 10 in. of which three are tail. Weight
about 160 grams (5 oz.).
Two geographical subspecies occur: the " true " Black-headed Caique
(P- m. melanocephala ), which is found north of the Amazon river to as
far east as the Guianas fits the above description; the " Pallid " Caique
( P . m. pallida ), which is also north of the Amazon but to the west of the
continent, has the orange of the first race muted to lemon-yellow. Several
of the Black-headed Caiques imported to this country--all of unknown
geographical origin--exhibit many intermediate variations of colour
between these two subspecies so that there may well be a cline, or inter-
diffusion, of the two races.
The only other species of caique--the White-bellied Caique (P.
lencogaster) --may be thought of as a Black-headed Caique that has, as
have so many other neotropical parrots, " lost " its black pigmentation.
For the young fledglings of this species resemble, as it were, " natural
hybrids " between the two species, because the legs, feet and exposed
skin are black and the beak streaked with the same pigment. The head,
which in the adult White-bellied Caique is bright apricot, in youngsters
is dirty brown very thickly scattered with many black feathers. The
albino-looking, flesh-pink feet and skin and the white bill of the adult
White-bellied Caique takes almost a year to appear by the gradual
absorption of the pigmentation. The head feathers become changed to
apricot at the first moult.
Both species of caique, from Mr. F. Waite's and my own observation, i
react toward one another as if they are the same bird. Certainly I can
detect no real differences in behaviour or voice. The separation of two
geographically adjacent " species " on such an extremely trivial difference
as the amount of melanin in the skin and tissues seems rather pretentious.
Perhaps it might be better to consider all caiques as geographical races--
subspecies--of the same bird, with the White-bellied as the most
" advanced " species. Fig. 1 (map of distribution).

After many bewildering months of confusion I believe that male caiques
can be distinguished from females by behaviour and by the position in
which they hold their body feathers. The comparison of beak dimensions
(Butler, Prestwich, Bates and Busenbark) has no validity. Mrs. Williams,
in correspondence, who has bred over 40 caiques during the past 13 years,
remarks on the irrelevance of beak size and I have confirmed this with my
own two breeding pairs. Intensity of colouring may also be of little
practical value. I say this despite my having three hens of the nominate
race that are so obviously paler in their orange colouring than are two
males, of the same race, owned by Mr. Waite. His male caiques also
have a definite yellow tinge suffusing the white of the underparts--this
is not noticeable with the hens.
In late October 1970 I bought two " Pallid " Caiques from Mr. W.
Duncan of Dumfries. These I wrongly accepted as a true pair. The
larger bird (Havershmidt records that males weigh more than females)
was a self-assured bully, treating humans with an indifference and con-
tempt. If he bit, which he would do whenever the opportunity occurred,
it was done without malice, rather as if it was the correct procedure with
incautious fools. The other--from its smaller size, more drab coloration
ind gentle, confiding nature--was taken to be an obvious hen. " Her "

bill was so strikingly much thinner and more hooked than the other.
These two male " Pallid " Caiques, for so they were, lived, except for
slight bickering, as a seemingly perfect pair. Indeed so stupidly reluctant
was I to abandon my opinion as to their gender, despite so much
behavioural evidence to the contrary, that I kept them together until as
late as early April of this year.
It is, of course, an extreme pity that the only absolute way of sexing
livebirds--by chromosome analysis(Hungerford et al .)--is too scientifically
elaborate to be undertaken by anyone not having access to a good tissue-
culture laboratory. Laparotomy (surgical investigation of the abdominal
cavity) might be as effective. However my experience with autopsy
material has shown that immature parrots, even with the benefit of a
dissecting-microscope, can be difficult to sex. This, and a dislike of
causing distress, forbad me using it on any of my birds.
With hindsight I now know that adult caiques are, especially if tameness
allows close observation, reasonably easy to differentiate into males and
females.
Males. When offered a mirror, or put in the near proximity of any
strange caique, threat display, which is a slow, dignified, very upright
walk punctuated by little jumps. When jumping the caique may physi-
cally leave the perch or merely " token " jump in which the caique i
" bounces " on the perch. The expansion of the orange-red iris gives the
eyes a non-blinking, fixed, glazed look. Hardy (1963) quixotically calls
this blazing of the eye " pupil flexion "--the iris is the muscle. Males,
with blazing eyes, may slowly execute several slow, majestic bows, the
head is dipped well below the level of the feet and then slowly raised until
the bird finishes bolt upright. Every so often the head is pumped up and
down which can result in food being regurgitated. The intention of
feeding the other bird is obvious, males during this and at all times 1
(unless frightened into sleekness) have the majority of the body feathers
fluffed and the tail fanned out. Males often " wing-whirr " which
consists of holding tightly to the perch and flying on the spot, simulating ;
a bird caught by the feet and trying to escape by flight. This is always an
aggressive or intimidatory act. Hens may " wing-whirr " on occasions,
such as when her mate and another caique fight or when disturbed from
the nest when both the sexes " wing-whirr " at my intrusion.
Female caiques are not aggressive towards other caiques, or only show :
the usual fighting and petty scraps that come when settling " peck
orders". When paired off they may then become aggressive towards ;
other females, more especially if their mate decides to flirt with the other
bird. (Males are extremely aggressive one to another, when paired up--
which might explain the large number of male caiques that have a toe,
or toes, missing. I have not seen a male physically attack a female.)
Unless cold or ill hens are sleek-plumaged birds--more tidy-looking--
than the rather dishevelled males. The tail feathers are so obviously

)f the cheek, neck and body feathers of males and the narrower, pinched-

\mazona, Pionus and Pionites parrots. Mr. Clifford Smith, in corres-

them sorted out into potential breeding pairs, which would then have been
turned out into summer flights. However the more that I checked up
on any reference to the breeding of neotropical parrots, the more certain
I became that the size of flight might be unimportant. More relevant,
it seemed that almost all American parrots seemed preferentially to nest
" indoors ", in comparative darkness, rather than in the light of the open
air. Therefore I restricted my breeding attempts to these three cages.
Caiques are not infrequently bred, as the references in the International
Zoo Year Books testify, yet, as far as my information extends, I believe
that LadyPoltimore's 1936 success with (" hybrid " Black-headed x White-
bellied) caiques still remains unique to this country and, possibly, Europe.
Each one of my six birds had been bought privately during the last
autumn, winter and early spring. For three weeks I also had a pair of
White-bellied Caiques (P. /. xanthomeria) under observation. As they
were youngsters, and therefore of no breeding value for this year, I loaned
them out to a friend. Sadly not all my caiques are as blithely tame and
indifferent to my close presence as are the two males. Generally the
wilder ones take five or ten minutes to settle down after I take a seat in
their shed. Work allows little free time yet I managed a minimum sum
total of two or three hours of caique-watching a week. Once they started
breeding, for fear of upsetting the hens, my contact was reduced to the
feeding times, say 10 minutes twice a day.

Food and Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999363090909091" page_id="58076678"  page_num="206" year="" vol="">
As a group I find that none of my caiques will eat green food. I still
offer some daily. At best it is taken up to be torn apart from some
destructive urge and is certainly never eaten. Even green garden peas
are ignored or bitten in two, tasted and dropped unconsumed. Sun-
flower and hemp seed, and precious little of the latter, form the main
seed diet. When the chick hatched boiled maize was fed. This, bread
and milk, and fruit--especially red-currants--formed the larger proportion
of the chick's diet.
Cracked walnuts, they cannot tackle an entire nut, is the especial
favourite food. Most, not all, eat peanuts. When the supply of walnuts
dried up in February one pair of caiques, in protest, went on a futile
hunger-strike, capitulating after the second day. Fruit is given daily.
Pomegranates are favourite: being a strictly seasonal fruit they mostly I
made do with orange, apple and grapes (they will not eat banana). Red-
currants and Siberian crabs, from the garden, reduce the summer and
autumn fruit bill. Tree buds, eaten with relish by most parrots, are
picked off the branches and dropped as debris.
Nothing seems to be known of the diet in the wild. By inference, and
examination of the alimentary tract of an autopsy specimen, it would
seem to be most probably composed of fruits and large seeds and soft-
shelled nuts. For fear of them falling to some deficiency disease bread
and milk are given occasionally over the winter and daily when breeding.

Likewise proprietary vitamin drops (Abidec, Parke-Davis) are added,
sporadically, to the drinking water.
Caiques, when they eat fruit, swallow the juice rather than consume the
pulp. When fruit is particularly juicy loose particles and droplets are
thrown off the beak by rapidly flicking the head. Consequently, with
caged caiques, the surroundings soon become festooned with small pieces
of sticky, dried fruit. Like so many other birds, caiques also flick the
head when under nervous tension. Thus a frightened caique disturbed
by my near presence, and hungry following a railway journey, shook each
sunflower seed in the beak as it shelled and ate it. Under normal circum-
stances dry seed is eaten with no such movements. Likewise a caique
hovering greedily next to its feeding partner, longing, but not daring, to
snatch the fruit from the rightful possessor, continually flicks the head.
Much head-shaking is shown during courtship, by both sexes, and males,
when challenging one another to a fight, do this pretty rigorously.
Males, I have not heard it from females, as they eat succulent foods,
or when they drink--if they are very thirsty--utter a low, self-satisfied,
whine. And it may be given, in anticipation, when putting fresh fruit
into the cage.
The head is not raised to swallow fluid. When drinking water, or
sipping fruit juice, the tongue moves, piston-like, lapping within the
partly-open bill. In many ways, including colouring pattern, the move-
ments of the birds, their shape, and in this lapping, caiques remind me
of lories.
Some parrots, for example Ringnecks and Lorikeets, seem not to mind
another individual sharing a foot-held meal. Caiques are more selfish.
An angry " squar " of annoyance is scolded at any adjacent caique--even
if it is its mate and whom it may be feeding at the time--to make it keep
its distance.
Caiques are extremely prehensile-footed (Smith 1971)- I have not
seen them stand on a food item to stop it moving. One male, when
eating peanuts, separates the kernel into two halves; retaining one half
in an upright foot it pares out the centre of the beak-held portion with
rasps of the lower jaw. Then dropping the now boat-shaped, scooped-out
half, takes the foot-held half from the foot and then eats that.
I
Voice
Caiques are most vociferous birds. Rather than go through the
tedium of describing different noises and my interpretation of their
function, I will limit myself to the three mentioned by Dorothy Snyder
in her " Birds of Guyana ".
Crowing: This is performed by both sexes when they are resting. The
caique lifts the wings to momentarily poise them above the head. 1 he
raising of the wings reveals a patch of henna-coloured elongated flank
feathers normally concealed by the folded wings. This signal marking,

despite the variations of body colour in the different " forms ", is always of
this rich orange-red. When the wings reach their summit the caique gives a
" piping toot ", which can be a single or a double " pipe ". The wings
are then closed. Crowing seems to be a contact, or " whereabouts " call.
For all caiques within earshot tend to reply with similar crowings. Two
birds of a pair may alternately crow, or even crow together. The noise
is repeated at several minute intervals. A " low intensity " version also
exists, in which the wings are not raised from the body, or just " token "
lifted and dropped--rather like a shrugging of the shoulders.
Screaming: This is a most unpleasant noise. Miss Snyder describes
them as " Heeyah-heeyah " and " wheech-wheech-wheech Just as
young children sometimes take extreme delight in competitively screaming,
pausing for a while after each burst as if savouring the very echoes, so do
Caiques. This seems to be done without any purpose save exuberance;
I suppose that " Heeyah-heeyah " is roughly indicative of what it sounds
like. A far worse shrieking is that done in mobbing. If I carry a net
or paper bag or start cleaning them out, introduce another species of
bird or whistle a rapid, and poor, imitation of a cuckoo, then all start

screaming. It would have to be a very dull-eared predator to withstand
such an onslaught of sound for long. " Wheech-wheech-wheech " is
3nly part of the noise, warning " skwarks " are part of the din. Males
' wing-whirr " while making this noise, hens remain sleek and frightened-
iooking.
The Nest-box
Like conures, and the smaller macaws, caiques roost within a cavity at
night and they prefer a dimly lit box to one that is well exposed to the
light. The pair of male "Pallid" Caiques that were housed together
during December and January in my work-room deserted the nest-box
provided, next to the window, and made a nest on the floor, in the very
darkest corner of that ill-lit room under some scraps of timber and plywood
leaning against the wall. The floor of the nest was made springy with a
mattress of wood parings.
It may not be generally realized just how many parrots, other than the
well-recorded Lovebirds, Hanging-parrots and Quaker Parrakeets
[{Agapornis, Loriculus and Myiopsitta ), actively construct a nest. Mrs.
Johnstone (1907), writing of the breeding of the lorikeet named after her
(Psitteuteles johnstoniae), describes how the birds half-filled nest-boxes
with " scraps and bits of twig and fibre ". During a telephone con-
versation Miss Chamberlain told me that her Chattering Lories ( Domicella
garrula :) built a nest, within their box, from bark peelings stripped from
a vine growing in a greenhouse they were occupying.
Roseate Cockatoos ( Cacatua roseicapillus) have been several times
recorded as collecting nest material; e.g. Suckley (1961) writes, " the
male alone built the nest from pieces of willow about 6 in. long, taking
them into the tree ". And H. Diekmann (1961) says of Leadbeater's
Cockatoos (C. leadbeateri) that once they have taken possession of a box
they " steadily carry dried leaves and shavings into it ".
Most (certainly all those that I've bred) Australian parrakeets carry
nesting material--pieces of chickweed and blades of grass--into the nest-
box, even if they may be removed later. This cannot be wholly incidental
for it is unusual for grass-parrakeets ( Neophema ) and Manycolours
(Psephotus varius) to carry green-stuff in the beak. Holmes-Watkins
(1952) substantiated by Forshaw (1969) writes that Splendid Grass-
Parrakeets (N. splendida) " like lovebirds tear off strips of green leaf and
tuck them behind the wings and in the rump feathers ".
Ili Keas ( Nestor notabilis ) build quite substantial nests (Jackson 1963).
Such a list of the use of nesting material by parrots might be continued
for many species, for which I have references.
Male Caiques (hens to a far lesser degree) strip parings from the inside
of the nesting chamber to form an inch-thick mat for the bottom of the
i box. Yet should a detritus of " sand, soil and twigs " be put within,
this is scraped out by the birds (Mrs. Williams). This year by experiment

G. A. SMITH--BLACK-HEADED CAIQUES
I have given, as a nest-box filler, for all my parrots, including the caiques,
a small fistful of dry wood shavings--avoiding the usually recommended
damp, decaying vegetation. These wood shavings were chewed up by
the birds into smaller fragments. The pair of hens that are kept together
have barely touched their nesting litter.
Chewing the wood of the box takes place in the day but mostly by night.
When the cocks are chewing they interrupt their carpentry with a charac-
teristic " nest-box call ". When the caiques were inside the house, in
the work-room, this noise and the gnawing were sufficiently loud to awaken
me every night and persistent enough to keep me from falling off to sleep
again.
The roosting chamber is never defaecated in. Caiques, even when
they are not provided with a roosting box, still practise this nocturnal
continence, voiding a large cumulative stool after they leave the roost
in the morning. Breeding males guard their box against other males and :
the females against other females and therefore they generally sleep in I
pairs. Several non-breeding hens, or one cock and several hens, may 1
roost within the same cavity with only slight squabbling between the birds.
"
Bathing
Caiques bathe several times a week. They do this exactly like a
Blackbird. The head is dunked under while the bird stands in the water
and flutters water over itself. This is strongly mimetic, if one pair bathe
then it is usual for all the rest to follow suit.
Caiques also foliage-bathe, which consists of rubbing themselves on
rain-soaked branches, and they have a unique habit of chewing off a piece
of bark from a twig and rubbing themselves on the resulting moist, exposed,
wood surface. I am not certain as to whether such a moist area stimulates
the caique to rain-bathe or whether they peel off the bark that they may
sap-bathe. Caiques, mostly seen in isolated individuals, will rub them- j
selves on perfectly dry projecting twigs. In this rubbing, which has a
cat-like quality, the cheeks, sides of the neck and the belly are involved.
Usually alternate sides of the birds are rubbed in sequence. Because of
this habit, caiques, especially if housed outside with natural wood perches,
often have a dirty soiled look to the feathers concerned. Miss R. M. Low,
in correspondence, has said that this sap-bathing, seen in her own caiques,
reminds her of anting, so engrossed do the birds seem in their actions.
Tasting the sap and experimentally rubbing it in a wound gives no acrid
taste or sensation.

A preening caique often stimulates another adjacent bird to walk over
to preen the first bird. This second bird will often take over the area
being preened by the first bird, whereupon the first bird leaves off.
Should the allo-preened area be lower than the head of the first bird then

the preening position then assumed by the second bird--head bowed--
often stimulates the first to then preen the head of the second bird. All
areas of the body may be preened by another, yet attention mostly seems
to be settled on the head. Two caiques may simultaneously preen one
another, like mutually grooming horses. Preening is not exclusive to
mated birds; all caiques preen one another quite irrespective of sex--it
is a social rather than a sexual act. Caiques in a high state of nervous
tension visibly simmer down in excitement when preening or being
preened.

Breeding
Initially, as I have said, my perplexity as to how to sex caiques was
aggravated because I would persist in putting emphasis on such irrelevant
items as colour and bill size. Several people had told me that captive
caiques may often be seen to physically pair with one another. Yet I
had to wait until the 8th April of this year before I saw, on the same day,
but on different occasions, my two males feeding one another and then
attempting to copulate. All doubts gone and now satisfied that they
were indeed two males I put the smaller " henny " bird into the smallest
pen which then contained two hens. (I should explain that this particular
male spent much of his time clinging to the wire of his original cage
facing, and obviously wanting to make closer acquaintance with these two
birds.) One of the hens always held her beak slightly ajar, despite being
able to close it firm. It was this caique that attracted the male's attention.
Once inside the new cage he pursued this hen and repeatedly regurgitated
food trying to get her to accept being fed. The intimidatory walk and
eye-blazing was mostly in abeyance. Eventually within 15 minutes the hen,
reluctantly it seemed, took food from him and after another few minutes
they were actively preening one another. The second hen in the cage,
though not directly attacked, became increasingly frightened, so I
removed her. Some hens in breeding condition have this gaping lower
jaw; certainly I can now identify it in three of my four hens, but have not
noticed it in males. Females with " normal " bills seem frightened of a
male's attentions. This gaping of the bill may well be, of course, an
artifact due to incorrect feeding, or some management factor. It is
* certainly not due to overgrowth of the beak.
A nest-box was given to this pair of " Pallid " Caiques on 15th April.
Immediately the male, after only some very slight reconnoitring
accompanied by low whistling noises and not a little wing-whirring,
entered the box. Once within he began to chew and made the same nest-
box noises as had kept me previously awake at night. Gradually over the
days the wood-parings from his activities covered the concave bottom to
the box. As later with my second pair, chewing was restricted to the
pieces of softwood purposely nailed inside the box just for that purpose.
Insubstantially built as the boxes are, being largely plywood, the birds

never marked the finer wood's surface as if its frailty was fully " under-
stood " by the birds. When males are in the box they make almost the
same, if not the identical, feeding noise, when regurgitating or feeding
their hen, as when they eat fruit. Outside the nest-box males--before
egg-laying commenced--very often regurgitate food. When they do so
it is always accompanied by a " te-de-dah " low whistling noise. This
feeding sound has a strong attraction for the females who, as they hear it,
come scurrying up to take the food offering. Paired birds are seldom
far apart and often sit with their tails crossed. Once they are sexually
paired off hens seem each day slightly more puffed in their feathering
than the day before. So that before they actually lay it is possible to be
momentarily confused as to which is the male and which the female.
As their fluffiness increases so does their aggressiveness towards other hens.
Copulation has been seen on several occasions. Like conures one foot
is placed on the back of the female while the other foot retains its grip
on the perch throughout the pairing. Mating may take place from either
side of the hen; once started there is no changing of sides as with lovebirds
(Dilger i960). Copulation is a prolonged process and may continue for
10 minutes and it seems, from its thrusting action, to be more mammalian
than avian. Very, very many attempts are made for each successful
pairing. No overt courtship precedes this. However a male was seen
preening his partner's head in a most unusually vigorous fashion and then
followed this by mating. Usually the male--paired birds always sit j
adjacent to one another--gingerly places his near-side foot on the small
of the female's back. Often the female takes a side-step and so puts a
temporary end to the male's efforts, or, on occasion, a hen may raise her
foot to ward the male off. Another avoidance action is for the female to
slip under the front of the male's body--which is easily done for caiques
stand almost as vertical as a penguin--to rest on his other side.
With both of my breeding pairs of caiques I have seen, on four separate
occasions, a male mounted by a female. In each instance it was because
a hen persistently refused to be trod by the male though she would stand
teasingly adjacent. Following a series of frustrated attempts at copulation
the males deftly put themselves (by holding the body horizontal and.
easing themselves) under the females, which results in the hen mounting
the male. Though active this was never quite such a vigorous pairing
as when the roles are reversed. Each time the male, after a few minutes,
eased himself out and then tried to mount the female, but always unsuc-
cessfully. Likewise hens sometimes feed males. When regurgitating a
male invariably accompanies it with his " te-de-dah " noise. Hens, when
they feed males are silent, likewise they keep their plumage sleek and not
fluffed as males do when they feed females. Hen parrots not uncommonly
feed males. Brockway (1969) says of budgerigars that " under appropriate
conditions all behaviour patterns except sperm emission, incubation,
feeding of young less than seven days of age and ' egg laying ' may be

performed by either males or females." And this is probably true of the
vast majority of parrots. In caiques (as with these others?) it is excep-
tional rather than invariable for a female to behave as a male. The
**
following two examples may show that with caiques a hen may sometimes
feed her mate as a displacement activity when his attention is distracted
from her.
A female not daring to approach her mate for fear that he would lunge
at her while he was engrossed in eating peanuts--to which she is indifferent
--after a few minutes regurgitated and fed the cock. Another hen
regurgitated food, and swallowed it back without attempting to feed her
spouse, when he was eating orange and not paying attention to her.
One most obvious aspect of caique feeding caique is that the feeding
bird firmly grasps the upper beak of the recipient at right angles and the
food is pushed, by the tongue, into the side of the bill. All the many
other parrots, save conures and macaws, that I've seen cross-feed one
another or their chicks do so by approaching the two beaks head on--like
feeding finches. Feeding in this side-beak " conure fashion " seems to
be more messy than the " orthodox " way for the hen very soon acquires
a dirty face from spillage and, following each feeding, portions of the meal
can be seen adhering to the upper mandible.
Sequence of Nesting of the First Pair
14th April 1971.--Male seen, for first time, to pair with female. The
other male whose hen is not interested in nesting because the log then
provided was not suitable for nesting in, has a musical ' ow '; this noise
is always accompanied by a head flick.
12th May 1971.--For some days the pair has been dueting. She
whistles a "da" and he immediately synchronises with a " de " note,
as if the noise was uttered by a single bird, no appreciable interval separa-
ting the notes. " Da " is a rising note, " de " a falling one. Minor
squabbling when the male offers his head for preening to the female and
she won't comply; he gives the same noise as if she were trying to steal
food off him. When the male challenges, the male on the other side of
the passageway " threat walks ", as described before, but makes progress
towards his rival by " helicopter flying "--flying up unnecessarily high
and dropping down on the perch, each flight taking it nearer the second
male. When the belly feathers are fluffed the colour is noticeably darker
because of the shadow at the base of each feather. The hen, often sitting
fluffed now, utters a short note of " za " very often.
25th May 1971.--Hen often in box. If not, when I make my appear-
ance, she hurries over and pops inside with the male in pursuit. Such a
lack of circumspection about revealing the whereabouts of the nest is
characteristic of parrots in general. When not in the nest the caiques are
always found sitting at the furthest point away from it.
28th May 1971.--At mid-day the hen was found on the floor of the
cage with her feet contracted, the toes bunched, otherwise she seemed fully

conscious. Believing that she was going to lay, and palpating an egg, I
injected her with calcium borogluconate as treatment for egg-binding.
While she lay on the floor the male remained close to her side and made
continual attempts to copulate with her. Five minutes following the
injection--as so often happens with calcium injected egg-bound hens--
she was seemingly normal and climbed back into the nest. A few hours
later I found she had laid her first egg of a clutch of three, average size of
which was 29-5 mm. by 23-5 mm., weight average 9 grams (an egg to body
ratio of about 1 : 16), incubation beginning with the first egg. Three
seems to be the general number (Mrs. Williams). Lady Poltimore's bird
laid four and my second pair two. (These second eggs were lighter,
longer eggs and measured 30-5 mm by 20 mm.) The laying interval
between successive eggs the usual two days.
From the very beginning and throughout incubation hen caiques very
often utter a persistent series of slightly hoarse-sounding " squee, squee,
squee ..." which is given whether the male is in the box or outside.
Though not a loud noise I could distinctly hear it from a 20-yard distance.
The relationship between this brooding noise and that made by the chick
is interesting. When I first heard the chick, at three days old, it was as a
thin " peep, peep ". It was in fact the same sound as that made by an
incubating hen but given through a smaller instrument. For as the chick
grew the tone changed continually with its ever-increasing size so that by
eight weeks the noise that it made precisely duplicated that made by
incubating hens. Indeed the male behaved, from seven weeks onward,
towards the nest-box as he had during the incubation. For he flew on
the wire adjacent to the box when I fed them and would enter and peer
out at me through the entrance hole. A practice that he had abandoned
shortly after the chick had hatched.
When the alarm note of " weyak " is given by another caique the
wheedling noise of the incubating hen stops and she may look out of the
box. Males often sit inside with the hen, snuggled by her side, though
not on the eggs, for some of the day. They continue roosting at night
within the box throughout the whole of the reproductive period. After
fledging the chick shares the box with the parents at night.
Caiques normally roost very early in the evening--at least an hour&apos;
before sun-down. Breeding males retire much later than this and as
with Pyrrhura Conures, may often be seen within the box but with the
head peering out. Hens bathe regularly during incubation though with
more frequency towards the end of the period. A single chick hatched
from both clutches. The remaining eggs were fertile and contained
full-term chicks that I assume failed to hatch because of the dry con-
ditions inside the shed. Incubation is 27 + 1 day.
Caique chicks are typical of neotropical parrots in that the bill has the
characteristic bulbous swelling at the base of the upper, and to a slighter
degree the lower, bill (Figs. 4 and 3). They have massive muscular napes

to the neck when hatched--because a chick being fed, like an adult bird,
vigorously bobs the head up and down to stimulate the feeding bird.
The body is clothed with a white, not too thickly distributed, filamentous 1
down. (Development almost exactly duplicates that of the hybrid macaw
chick photographed and hand-raised by Mr. Ralph Small, illustrated in j
the second edition of Bates and Busenbark.) The newly hatched chick
cannot raise its head from the ground. Body growth is steady so that
in a fortnight it was as big, and almost as rotund, as a golf-ball. It must
have possessed considerable powers of cold tolerance, for the hen, once
it reached this stage, spent large amounts of time out of the nest and the
chick, when I examined it, which I did almost daily, often seemed dread-
fully cold to the touch. Never at any stage did I see it with other than a
tightly packed crop. Distinct from Australian parrots, nothing recog-
nizable as food could be made out through the transparency of the skin,
a milky white firm-feeling mass filling the crop. After a fortnight I
could feel portions of hulled seed. I could never see grit in the crop,
nor could I find any in the chick's rather watery faeces when I examined
these, nor have I noticed the parents collect such. It being a general
observation of mine that usually once parrot chicks hatch, the male spends
much time on the floor searching after grit. This is necessary because
parrot chicks are fed on part-digested grain and the grit is needed in the
gizzard to triturate the food. Even day-old chicks of other parrots most
often have grit inside them. Though the chick had very watery faeces
the nest-box remained perfectly dry throughout the rearing. From five
weeks onward a fresh pile of soiled nest material lay on the floor under the
nest hole each day and I believe that the parents scraped it out with the
feet because most of it was too dust-fine to have been picked up by the
beak.
At 20 days the caique chick's eyes were perceptible as mere slits.
A curiously pale, absolutely helpless chick, gross with fatness. The
appearance, even at this stage, is rather foetal or embryonic. At 25 days
old a faint blueness of the skin on the wings indicated where feather
formation was taking place, and at four weeks the pin feathers could be
seen in the wings. Growth of body and feathers seemed more rapid at
this point onwards yet the chick was 28 days old before I saw it holding * I
its head off the ground. At five weeks it resembled a porcupine and at
39 days I could see the first colour--the green of the wings. At six
weeks it was clearly identifiable as a Black-headed Caique and it weighed
124 grams (4 oz.). It first looked out of the box when 52 days old and
left its security and the nest after 73 days (Waite's hybrid Black-headed/
White-bellied caique took 71 days), after hanging suspended head down-
wards from the nest hole for several days previous. It was first noticed
feeding itself, on bread and milk, a fortnight later, though the parents still
fed it. By now (late September) the parents had recommenced spending
long periods in the nest-box and the male was feeding the female, probably

at six weeks of age--a month previous. It seemed about a quarter
smaller than the parents. The beak horn-coloured, save for the black,
streaky base to the upper mandible, periorbital skin pale grey, iris dark
mahogany brown, thighs green-streaked and all the yellow body feathers
noticeably paler than the adults. The most obvious difference between
it and the old birds is that the chest and belly are pale yellow and not
dirty white.
Once the chick hatched the male almost ignored the female outside the
box. Hardy (1963) saw much the same thing with wild Orange-fronted
Conures (Aratinga canicular is). From the 10th day onwards the male
fed the chick directly, until then, in the usual sequence, he fed the hen in
the box and she then fed the chick.

(Latiius schach)
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
An account of the partially successful breeding of my pair of Indian
Rufous-backed Shrikes has been published before (England, 1969). On
that occasion one youngster was reared, partly by the parents and partly
by hand-feeding. Despite imperfect feet it is still alive and well and is
believed to be a female because it is an indefatigable, though inexpert,
nest-builder and because it has lived for two years with a known female
of the same species, which also builds nests, without any further progress
towards breeding. Their association, both in aviaries and cages, has been
amicable (which is unlikely had they both been males), any slight difference
of opinion being settled by the use of submissive or conciliatory bowing
by the dominated bird--accompanied by a rapid staccato clucking by
both--which instantly puts an end to any aggressive behaviour between
birds of this species.
In the following year two young were reared to a fortnight old by the
original pair. However, in the very early hours of a June morning, during
my absence abroad, a lot cf noise from the aviary brought my wife into the
garden to find both young birds on the ground, one of them dead. She
hand-reared the survivor but it unfortunately died later from an infection.
This (1971) spring the parents were moved to a larger aviary,
22 ft. x 4 ft- x 7 ft., with an " escape " door at one end, the intention being
to allow the male his liberty when the female commenced incubating if,
as on previous occasions, he refused to take anything but mealworms to the
nest. In the event this proved unnecessary.
Some forked twigs (in fact those used as a nest-site by my Great Grey
Shrikes in the previous year) were put up close to the roof of the flight,
with fresh holly tied round as screens. It was sheltered from above
against rain and sun. A neat nest was built of sticks and coarse grasses,
lined with finer grasses and roots, with some glass wool which I use in
preference to natural wool under the impression that it is less likely to get
twisted round toes; it is certainly a good insulator. No actual courtship
was noted, though such sexual activity as was seen was initiated, as
recorded before, by the female, who begged (ineffectually) for food with
fluttering wings and crouched in a soliciting posture. With binoculars
from a bedroom window it could be seen that on 30th April, when
incubation commenced, there were at least three eggs. Partly to avoid
interfering, and partly for fear of being scalped by a very brave pair of
birds, I did not enter the aviary for a closer inspection. That night, and
for several nights thereafter, there was a sharp frost.
Despite my getting used to the alarming way in which shrikes leave
their eggs for long periods, there appeared to be several occasions when

M. D. ENGLAND--BREEDING THE RUFOUS-BACKED SHRIKE
these eggs must have become very cold. However, on 18th May an
eggshell was seen impaled on a favourite thorn--hatching had started.
Incubation was entirely by the female and lasted 18 days.
Their normal winter diet of diced ox heart rolled in Vionate, middlings
and bone flour, with occasional locusts and maggots (augmented with
powdered cuttle prior to and during laying) had been continued through
the incubation period until a day or two before hatching when mealworms
fed on white bread and rolled in Vionate were added.
As on previous occasions the young were fed entirely on mealworms for
the first few days. Practically all food was taken to the nest by the male
and passed to the female, who in turn fed the young. She left the nest at
almost no other time than to defaecate until the young were nearly a week
old, when whe started collecting food herself. This year the parents
took meat and small locusts to the nest as well as mealworms, though the
last predominated. Food scattered on the floor of the flight was taken
much more readily than that in dishes in the shelter, although this is,
of course, a wasteful method of feeding since both mealworms and locusts
escape. Only one item at a time is taken to the nest, unlike so many
insect-feeding birds which carry a loaded beakful. It seems worth
recording that to shrikes (or at least to those species which I have kept)
there appears to be a minimum size of creature which they regard as
edible. Thus half-grown maggots, newly-hatched locusts and very small
mealworms are left untouched even when a bird is desperately hungry.
By the time the young were a fortnight old, pieces of ox heart about
i cm. square, straight from the refrigerator, were being thrust down their
throats by the parents in between mealworms and locusts. Feeding was
by fits and starts, intense activity alternating with periods of complete rest.
Right up to when the young left the nest the female spent much of her
time either brooding or standing guard over them, while the male
attempted to attack through the wire-netting any living creature--from
sparrows to man--which ventured anywhere near the aviary. The
adjacent aviary had to be left empty because any occupant was driven
remorselessly back and forth until it collapsed exhausted.
This more varied diet than the parents had been willing to use on
previous occasions led to hope of more successful rearing, without
deformities, although the five perfect youngsters which left the nest during
the afternoon of 3rd June (at 16 days old) were more than we had dared
to hope for. Quite indescribable was the pandemonium caused by seven
shrikes in one small aviary all shouting loudly at once, the parents chasing
excitedly from one end to the other to ward off imagined enemies, the
youngsters crashing from side to side and often hanging from the roof.
Most unexpectedly, the parents led their brood back to the nest to roost
for the first night, which is interesting in view of our previous experience
of a young Great Grey Shrike Lanins excubitor using a nest as a roosting
place (England, 1970). This habit was soon discouraged by the female

when nest-building recommenced; thereafter they found perches where
they usually huddled together for warmth.
Three of the chicks were removed for hand-rearing, although the
parents continued to care for the remaining two, which were able to fly
the full length of the aviary within two days and were entering the shelter
on the third day, at which time also at least one of them was pecking
mealworms from a dish.
Two days after the first brood flew, the parents started building a
second nest about 12 in. from the first. Unfortunately its position was
such that it was not possible to see clearly into it from the window above,
although this time I had the opportunity to watch carefully the roles of
the sexes in nest-building. The site was chosen by the female, who also
commenced the actual building of the nest by laying rough grasses and
thin twigs in position. On the next day the male was collecting material
and carrying it to the female who, although she also did some collecting,
was now spending much of her time on the site arranging the jointly-
gathered material while she shuffled round and round forming the shape
of the cup. Attempted coition was observed on this day, having followed
some rather acrimonious exchanges and chasing of the female by the male
(she was not the initiator on this occasion), the act only being accomplished
after happy relations had been restored by much submissive bowing and
clucking.
I noticed her picking up pebbles and mandibulating them as though
trying to crush them. On the off-chance that she was seeking calcium
I threw down some crushed--though not powdered--cuttle which she
immediately started swallowing. During the next two or three days she
consumed--while I watched--at least a heaped dessertspoonful of this.
She commenced incubation of her second clutch on 13th June and, rather
unusually, sat steadily from the start, coming off infrequently and briefly
to feed, with the usual longer period in the evenings when she had a
thorough preen.
Meanwhile the male continued most assiduously to care for the two of
the first brood which had been left with him, feeding them long after they
were really capable cf looking after themselves. One of them persisted in
visiting the new nest and begging food from the sitting female, who
angrily chased it off. This became such a nuisance that they were
removed to an adjacent aviary when they were 27 days old. At first
they would eat only mealworms, unlike the hand-reared members of the
family which were by then eating almost everything put in front of them,
from chunks of meat to full-grown locusts. Like all our other shrikes,
they had commenced ejecting pellets of undigested food immediately after
leaving the nest. I have no evidence that young shrikes bring up pellets
while still in the nest, although three species ( L . clamcLtov , schach and
excubitor ) have done so after being removed from the nest prematurely for
hand-rearing.

M. D. ENGLAND--BREEDING THE RUFOUS-BACKED SHRIKE
Young Rufous-backed Shrikes are of a generally light brown colour
on the upper parts, shading to greyish-brown on the head. The area
which will become the broad black band through the eye is already dark
grey-brown and rapidly becomes darker. The under parts are light in
colour, almost white, with very faint light brown barring on the sides of
the breast. In a remarkably short time--at about ten weeks old--they
have assumed adult plumage.
The second clutch of eggs was infertile, which is not altogether
surprising in view of the almost indecent haste with which they had
appeared. Two days after they were due to hatch they were on the
ground, smashed; the birds had despaired at the same time as I. It is
interesting that infertile eggs are lifted from the nest and dropped on the
ground, whereas the shells of those which have hatched are taken and
impaled on thorns or deposited carefully in a crevice.
The nest was immediately repaired and incubation of a third clutch
began on 8th July. On the eighteenth day two eggshells appeared on
thorns and shortly afterwards intense feeding activity started again by
the male. As before, for the first week he passed to the female all the
food which he took to the nest and she fed the chicks. On the sixteenth
day after hatching one youngster left the nest, followed by two more on
the following day. Despite unpleasant weather the three were reared
without incident by the parents, who thus produced eight healthy young,
free from ricketts, polyneuritis and all the other deficiency diseases which
had dogged their efforts in previous years. From about three weeks old
they had fed the second brood very largely on ox-heart rolled in bone-flour,
middlings and Vionate, despite the fact that mealworms were always
available. The young began picking up food for themselves at about
25 days old, although the parents fed them for long after this; by this time
the first brood had assumed adult plumage--that is at the age of about
three months.
Like their parents and other birds of the same species which we have,
this year's young are great songsters. One of the first brood started to
sing at 26 days old, followed within a day or two by his brothers and sisters;
we were awakened by their dawn chorus almost daily from immediately .
below our bedroom window. Only the males sing during the breeding
season--and then only just prior to nesting--while both sexes do so
intermittently at other times of year. The song varies from a loud rather
raucous repetitive " shouting " of various brief phrases, including a great
deal of mimicry, to a quiet warbling which sometimes persists for long
periods without a break.
At an early age the young birds acquire the adults' habit of carrying
around twigs and leaves and either impaling them or taking them to a spot
where they appear to build embryonic nests. They also carry stones and
dump them in their food dishes or wedge them in crevices. Some of

these stones are considerably heavier than the birds and are so large that
it is remarkable that they are able to pick them up, let alone carry them.
All the species of shrike which we have owned have been great
" characters " and they are some of the most interesting and amusing
birds to keep. They are mostly very hardy, become very tame and are
not difficult to keep in health once the technique has been mastered.
Although some people may be rather alarmed by the mention of such
things as the large number of locusts which ours appear to consume,
except while bleeding or when we happen to have a glut of locusts, they
live healthily for weeks on end on little else but " treated " ox-heart.
(As I write, 24th August, the female is incubating her fourth clutch!)
Summary
The successful breeding in captivity of Rufous-backed Shrikes is
described, eight young having been reared in two broods. The incubation
periods were 18 and 18 days, the young left the nest at 16 and 16/17 days
and fed themselves at about 25 days, although the parents continued to
feed them for some time longer. Adult plumage was assumed in about
three months.
As described above the Rufous-backed Shrike Lanius schach has been
bred by M. D. England. It is believed this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

and lacking clear demarcation. Fred Astles, however, describes his

The Moorhen is generally considered to be a poor flyer. It certainly
appears to take wing with difficulty, but it is capable of sustained flight,
especially at night, when it is more often heard than seen. I have never
had such an experience. I have, however, on several occasions seen it
perch in bushes and once, when surprised in long grass, a bird flew up
and perched momentarily on a branch of a tree, fully thirty feet from the
ground.

Interest in penguins in captivity during the past year has been greatly
stimulated, mainly by the efforts of Len Hill. There is some doubt as
to the origin of the name. Several theories have been advanced but
possibly the most likely is that it is a corruption of a Newfoundland
name " pin-wing ", meaning a bird that has been pinioned. On page 107
I ridiculed the idea of a " Rookery of Penguins ". I notice that the
Oxford Dictionary admits the rather uneuphonious " Penguinery " for a
colony of penguins.

the amputation but in 1959 lost the use of one eye through the activities
of a Fiscal Shrike Lanius collaris which attacked it in its cage. In June
1970 the second eye became opaque and by July the bird was blind,
although it still seemed in fair shape. It was then at least 16-5 years old."

Department of useless items. It is believed that the first bird to be
shot with a gun was a Moorhen in 1533. It was realised that the weapon
had possibilities and so it was tried on larger birds, Great Bustard, Crane,
Heron, Bittern. Gradually it superseded the cross-bow.
Dr. William Turner, writing of the Bittern in 1544, says: " It has very
long claws, for that which serves in birds the purpose of a heel exceeds
an inch and a half in length, on which account our countrymen use it to
pick their teeth, and mount it in silver."
Francis Willughby (1635-72) died at the early age of 37. He left his
manuscripts in an imperfect state. They were arranged and completed
by John Ray and published as " The ornithology of Francis Willughby,"
in 1678. Among the items recorded is that the " Fair Ladies of York "
at one time wore the blown-eggs of Hedge Sparrows as ear-rings.

first time in this country. The Black-collared are the same pair that
bred for the first time in the aviaries of the late W. R. Partridge.
" Swainson's Lorikeets reared one young one, as did a pair of Barn
Owls, rescued by the R.S.P.C.A. as youngsters from a bridge that was
about to be demolished. Our yellow Golden and Amherst's Pheasants
which we keep at liberty in the garden reared many young. In the
tropical house, two hybrid Pekin Robin-Silver-eared Mesia were reared.
Sun Bitterns hatched a fine youngster and then at io days old killed it and
threw it out of the nest. They are now sitting again in a nest at the top
of a 20 ft. tree. Scarlet Tanagers are sitting and Zosterops have had two
nests destroyed by the public. The Snowy Owls, that last year (at one
year old) reared three young, were put off this year by a boy who went
round the back of the aviary with a long cane which he pushed through
the wire-netting and lifted the hen up and down off her eggs. She
scrambled them after this and they were, of course, all fertile.
" The very handsome White-crested Touracos laid in a nest on the floor

penguins might lay this year as there was a great deal of copulation gcing

own small territories and fought off intruders, but no eggs appeared.
Perhaps they will go next year when they are more settled, as five of these
birds were only obtained in the spring.

Twenty-one years have passed since " News and Views " first appeared
above the initials " A. A. P." " The Bird of Time has but a little way to

appreciative thanks to those who have troubled to read them, for the

HOW TO RAISE AND TRAIN PIGEONS. By William H. Allen Jr.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978508575" page_id="58076705"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
Oak Tree Press Co. Inc., 1971 (10th printing). Distributed in the
U.K. by Ward Lock Ltd., London. Price #1-50.
This is an attractively got-up guide to the keeping and breeding of
domestic pigeons. The publisher's blurb says that " Basically, this is a
handbook ". As compared with Levi's classic recent monograph on this
subject, it is, however, a condensed handbook. Most of the better known
breeds, and some of the rarer ones, are listed and described, although not,
of course, in such detail as by Levi.
The book is illustrated with 21 full colour photographs and a great many
black and white photographs. These are excellent in themselves but the
captions to them do not seem on a par with the text and in three cases are
misleading. Perhaps this is due to the modern habit of employing
professional caption-writers instead of letting the author write the captions
to the pictures illustrating his work.
In view of its size (very convenient for carrying about and reading in
trains) and price, this book seems excellent value and can be recom-
mended to all thinking of taking up fancy or flying pigeons. As some
writers of this kind of book tend to gloss over difficulties I was pleased
that, in his chapter on " Settling Racing Homers ", the author accurately
describes what is likely to happen when one attempts to do so and how
to succeed in spite of it.
D. G.
Note. The misleading captions are on pages 8, 9 and 35.
ENCHANTING ENCOUNTERS WITH BIRDS. By Carl Naether.
Salt Lake City, Utah: Allen Publishing Co., 1971. (No price given.)
This conveniently small and well-printed book consists of nine chapters,
each describing the author's experience with some species of bird in the
wild or in captivity, and a final chapter, entitled " How Long Do Birds
Live in Captivity ", in which aviculture is defended. It is illustrated
with photographs by the author.
Enchanting though the encounters with the various species were for
the author, I did not feel, in reading them, that he managed to convey this
enchantment, in spite of, or perhaps because of, an enthusiasm that is
very evident in the writing. The defence of aviculture, forthright though
it is, made me as an aviculturist uneasily remember that old prayer,
" Lord, protect me from my friends, my enemies I can deal with myself ".
There are some interesting behavioural observations here and there but
one feels that most of them could have advantageously been given with
more detail.

TANGARA HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994466363636364" page_id="58076706"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
I have just read with great interest " Notes on the breeding of Tangara Hybrids "
in the July-August copy of the Avicultural Magazine.
I thought it might be of interest to you, to know I have bred two Hybrids this
year between a cock Superb and a hen Blue-headed.
I had what I thought were four cock Tanagers in a small greenhouse, with a
flight. A Superb, Blue-headed, Silver-throated and Golden-naped. I was very
surprised towards the end of May to find a small cup-shaped nest, about 5 ft. from
the ground, in a creeper just inside the greenhouse. I was even more surprised to
find an egg had been laid, it was the 27th of May, a second egg was laid the following
day. The Blue-headed Tanager flew off the nest when I entered the greenhouse
the following morning. Both eggs hatched out on 9th June and both left the nest
on the 23rd. The Blue-headed seemed to be always with the Superb, so I
presumed he was the other parent. I never saw the young fed while in the nest,
so could not tell that way. Fortunately I was in the greenhouse when the first
young one left the nest, immediately the Silver-throated attacked it, so I removed
both the Silver-throated and the Golden-naped. Both young ones seemed strong
and were soon flying around, both parents feeding them. They were fed on meal-
worms and gentles, pear, apple, grapes, a little banana, grated cheese, and sponge
cake soaked in nectar. They are now strong healthy birds, very much alike in
colouring, resembling the Superb more than the Blue-headed, but so far without
the bright yellow on the rump. I noticed to-day one or two very bright blue
feathers showing on the breast of both of them.

Blaby, Near Leicester.
From a German aviculturist, Mr. Th. Kleefisch, of Bonn-Duisdorf, I learned
that he has bred the following species, verified by colour transparencies which he
sent me: Tangara arthns goodsoni, Tangara icterocephala, and hybrids Cyanerpes
caeruleus ( chocoanus ?) X ^Chlorophanes spiza. Tangara arthus has, as far as I can
find, only been bred in Wassenaar, Holland, and it is a very fine achievement.
The breeding of the hybrids, a male and a female, of the honeycreepers is, I
think, of very great interest to science in view of the fact that the single skin of
Chlorophanes purpurascens Sclater, pictured in the Catalogue of Birds, vol. XI,
is now believed to be a hybrid of Cyanerpes cyaneus X Chlorophanes spiza.
Unfortunately the breeding was not discovered in due time to get a good report.
Mating was not observed, and only the female fed the young. Only by studying
the young was it possible to say which of two possibilities, Cyanerpes caeruleus or
Dacnis cayana , was the father. The female especially shows the characteristics of
Cyanerpes , the greenish legs and the rusty colouring of the cheeks and chin.
The Hybrids are the size of Chlorophanes spiza.
In the International Zoo Yearbook, vol. XI, is a report of a hybrid bred in
Dallas, U.S.A., between Chlorophanes spiza and Cyanerpes cyaneus.

SEXING PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9951254" page_id="58076706"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
May I make a brief (because I intend to write at greater length in another
context), reply to two of the points raised by Dr. Parkes' letter in the Sept./Oct.
Avicultural Magazine.
Whether a male parrot is a different colour from the female seems, to me, to
depend on two main factors: the permanence of the pair-bond and the regularity
of the food supply. For parrots that keep together just for the duration of the
breeding season--flocks of such birds are composed of individuals not of twos--
have sexual dimorphism well-marked. The display of the male is elaborate and
quite distinctive and separate from that of the female. Whereas those parrots j
that, at all times of the year, remain as paired couples are generally identically |

coloured. During courtship, though the male is the more active, the sexes have
an almost identical behaviour. The analogy taken here is waterfowl. Ducks and
geese Ducks, as a rule, keep in pairs only during the spring and males and
females are distinct. Geese have the sexes alike and maintain pairs the year round.
Parrots that live in areas of irregular and infrequent rainfall, or that raise their
young on the seeds of haphazardly fruiting trees--such as figs--must be able to
synchronize breeding not with the seasons but with a rapid increase in food supplies.
Breeding must, in such circumstances, be achieved as quickly as possible while the
temporary abundance of food lasts. Anything that helps to reduce the interval
between the " decision " to breed and the laying of the eggs will be of strong
selective advantage. D. Goodwin (Bull. Brit. Orn. Cl. 80 : 45-52), has shown
that considerable benefit for precipitate breeding will accrue if the sexes are visually
separate. All of the sexually dimorphic Australian "broadtails" and the only
sexually distinct Amazon parrots live in areas of low, and infrequent rainfall.
The correlation between the inability to use the foot for feeding and sexual
dimorphism is therefore because of a diet of small seeds and an irregular abundance
of food.
Dr. Parkes pleads a good case but I am still not convinced that the Yellow-lored
and the Spectacled Amazon Parrots A. xcintholovci and A. albifyons are other than
the same bird. The Yellow-Lored Parrot has a very restricted range, being found
only in " Yucatan, especially the eastern and central parts, and Cozumel Island ".
The Spectacled has an enormous range from near the U.S.A./Mexico border to
Costa Rica. Where the two Amazons meet is an area where both may be found.
Elsewhere when two or more Amazon parrots are found inhabiting the same area
then they differ markedly in voice, habitat preference, and colour and size. But
these two are practically identical in all of these respects. In my opinion, this
echoes such well-known cases as, say, Carrion and Hooded Crows Corvus c. corone
and C. c.&lt; cornix where a hybrid zone is found between the two subspecies.
Field, or " captive cross-breeding investigations are, I believe, required before a
positive case can be made for either point of view.

STRETCHING ATTITUDES IN HUMMINGBIRDS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.972232357142857" page_id="58076707"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
With reference to D. M. Reid-Henry's article which appeared in the Sept.-Oct.
edition of this magazine. I would like to point out the habit of stretching wing,
tail and leg together, is not common to hummingbirds.
These birds do have a number of stretching attitudes, and although the sequence
 |may vary, a newly awakened bird usually goes through the following procedure:
the neck is arched and the wings are raised but not opened. Then either one or
both wings are opened fully and stretched down alongside the body (not to the
rear as with most birds); at the same time the tail may be fanned. At no time are
the legs stretched.
Mr. Reid-Henry mentions that he believes Kingfishers may be unable to indulge
the habit which most birds have, of perching comfortably on one foot. Many
aviculturists believe the same with regard to hummingbirds. However, I can
vouch the following genera indulge in this habit: Coronets ( Boissonneaua ),
iPufflegs ( Eriocnemis ), Sylphs ( Aglaiocercus ), Trainbearers ( Lesbia ), Speckled
