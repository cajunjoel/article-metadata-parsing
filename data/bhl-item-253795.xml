Formosa where it inhabits mountainous country at moderate altitudes.
It has never been common and to-day may well be on the verge of
extinction in its native land.
This bird was discovered by the English naturalist Swinhoe in 1862,
and the first pair to reach Europe came to France in 1866. They
were bought by Baron de Rothschild who bred many young birds
and founded the stock in captivity. It is doubtful if any were imported
into Europe from Formosa after the end of the nineteenth century,
and to-day captive stocks both in this country and in America must be
highly inbred.
According to the census of ornamental pheasants conducted in
1958, there were at that time not less than 120 Swinhoe's Pheasants
in captivity in Great Britain. The number has probably increased
a little since then.
In 1958 two pairs of wild-caught Swinhoe's were obtained from
Formosa by Dr. K. C. Searle of Hong Kong. These were sent to
England and were presented to the Ornamental Pheasant Trust,
then in the process of formation, by Miss Kay Bonner and Mr. A. A.
Prestwich. From these birds two young cocks were reared that year
and these have since been mated to home-bred birds. The Trust
has, therefore, a much-needed change of blood with which to work.
Swinhoe's Pheasants are very beautiful and soon become tame.
The cock has a crisp plumage with a wonderful metallic iridescence.
The hen is also more colourful than many hen pheasants, with bright
red legs and a nicely patterned plumage formed by the chestnut and
black centres to her feathers.
This species does well in captivity even in small aviaries, and is

hardy. A cock can often be run with two or even three hens. Swinhoe's
sometimes breed the first year after birth though most do not start
until their second year. The male assumes full adult plumage the
first year. The eggs hatch quite well in incubators if given the same
treatment as ordinary game pheasant eggs, and the young are easy to
rear either under bantams or electric brooders. They thrive on
food such as turkey starter crumbs and it is advisable that these
should include a blackhead preventive of which several kinds are
available commercially.

A little over a year ago the Trust came into being and since then
it has developed rapidly. The collection of game birds is now the most
comprehensive in Britain and almost certainly one of the largest in
Europe.
The rise in membership has not been quite so spectacular. At the
moment it stands at nine life members, twelve sustaining members,
and 119 ordinary members, a total of 140. It is anticipated that there
will be a rapid increase in membership as soon as the collection can be
opened to the public. The search for another property in Norfolk
on which to keep the collection continues. As soon as a suitable
place can be found the collection will be moved there and the public
admitted. In the meantime the birds are kept at the Director's home.
Members and their friends are always welcome, but are requested
to give prior notice of their intended arrival. Over 250 people visited
the Trust this year.
Considerable publicity has been achieved during the year on behalf
of the Trust. This has included articles and letters in the National
Press, including The Times. The Director has made a short film of
some of the birds in the collection and has shown this both on Anglia
Television and at various lectures. It is hoped to intensify this campaign
in the future.
Useful contact has been made with Zoological Societies abroad,
including several behind the Iron Curtain. It is hoped to exchange
birds with these Societies to our mutual advantage in the future.
The Trust has been accepted by the Inland Revenue Authorities
as a charitable educational institution and is therefore exempt from
income tax.
It is with much regret that your Council has to report the death of
the Earl of Belmore at his home in Northern Ireland last July.
Professor Alessandro Ghigi of Bologna has agreed to become an
Honorary Vice-President of the Trust. Professor Ghigi has one of
the finest collections of game birds in Europe.
During his brief visit to this country in September Monsieur Jean
Delacour visited the Trust's collection and was able to give much
useful advice.
An offer of co-operation was made to the Nature Conservancy
in their work on the effects on game birds of poisonous crop sprays.
This offer was accepted on behalf of the Conservancy by Dr. M. W.
Moore of Furzebrook Research Station.
During the last year samples of egg-white from infertile eggs have
been sent to Cornell University, U.S.A., where our Council Member,
Professor Charles Sibley, is conducting research into the taxonomic rela-
tionship of birds by means of the electrophoresis of egg-white protein.

The work of the Trust is falling into two main fields--first that of
conservation ; to preserve species of game birds threatened with
extinction in their native haunts by propagating numbers in captivity.
Secondly, the broader aspect which includes the keeping of a repre-
sentative collection of game birds for comparative study and research,
the enlightenment of the public on the problems connected with these
birds, and the further education of the rising generation.

A total of fifty-two birds has been imported during the past year
and of these thirty-eight are still alive in the collection. At first sight
the losses (fourteen) may seem rather high but it should be remembered
that all of these were wild-caught birds and the great majority had to
endure sea and air travel from Borneo and China. Virtually all these
birds were obtained for the Trust by Dr. K. C. Searle of Hong Kong
who went to unlimited trouble both in collecting the birds and in
packing and shipping them. Dr. Searle also went on a collecting
expedition to Borneo where he obtained some very rare and interesting
birds for the collection.
Your Council is extremely grateful to Dr. Searle for his hard work
and enthusiasm and also wishes to convey its thanks to Mr. George
Mottershead of Chester Zoo, and Mr. D. H. S. Risdon of Dudley
Zoo for their kindness in providing quarantine for birds for the Trust.
Without their help it would not have been possible to import a single
bird.
The following forms have been imported during the last year :--

After four weeks in quarantine birds join the collection. Tropical
species which arrive during the summer are put outside in large
planted pens. Those arriving during the winter are put into heated
quarters until acclimatized. In this way losses have been kept to a
minimum and all the birds have settled down well.

The breeding season has been moderately successful and over 150
young birds were reared including five of the rare Scintillating Copper
Pheasant. The greatest problem has been infertility, particularly in
the rarer species ; this is no doubt due to existing stocks in this
country being highly inbred and emphasizes the importance of fresh
importations.
Two male Swinhoe's were bred from the wild-caught birds so
generously given to the Trust by Mr. A. A. Prestwich in 1958. These
have now been mated to home-bred hens and should provide a much-
needed change of blood ; they were probably the first wild Swinhoe's
to be imported into Europe from Formosa during this century.
Breeding results could hardly have been expected from the birds
recently imported from Borneo and other parts of the Far East, since
they had not had sufficient time in which to settle down and become
acclimatized. They have all started the winter in excellent condition.
Three main types of pen are used at Great Witchingham. The first
and most satisfactory for breeding birds is a large open-topped
enclosure 9 yards wide by 20 yards long. Each pen is well planted
with flowering shrubs and contains a shelter for the birds. The sides
are 9 feet high with an overhang inwards at 45 degrees. Pheasants
kept in these permanent pens have to be pinioned or brailed. The
enclosures are ideal for Tragopans, Monals, and Eared Pheasants,
all of which do better in large pens.
Over forty medium-sized movable pens are also in use both for
breeding pairs and growing stock. They are 20 ft. long by 10 ft. wide
by 4 ft. 6 in. high with light sloping shelters fixed inside. Many kinds
of pheasants and other game-birds do well in these pens which can
easily be moved by four men. The birds can thus receive fresh grazing
regularly--an important point with a species like the Common
Koklass which needs fresh green food to keep it healthy. It has been
noted that Koklass Pheasants kept in these pens will not eat the fruit
mixture which many species receive daily, as long as they have any
grass left. When their pen is first moved the birds can be watched
grazing eagerly and they crop the grass almost as short as geese.
The third type of movable pen is the " Whitlock " fold, well known
on most game farms. This fold is quite small, 10 ft. long by 6 ft. wide
by 4 ft. 6 in. high and is easily moved by two people. All the true
pheasants and some other forms breed well in these pens which should
be moved daily. The Trust uses them mainly for breeding pairs of
quail and francolin and also for rearing growing stock.
Three types of heated winter quarters are in use for tropical and
less hardy species. The first of these consists of a well insulated house
divided into pens each 10 ft. by 6 ft. and with an outside run attached
to each pen. The birds are shut in at night during the winter and an

infra-red lamp is hung over the perches for warmth. The second house
is a converted broiler house 80 ft. long by 19 ft. wide divided into
pens each 10 ft. by 6 ft. down both sides of the house which is warmed
by oil heaters. In addition, six small individual huts each 8 ft. by 4 ft.
and with an outside run attached, are in use for wintering certain
species of partridges, francolins, and quail. Each hut is fitted with
electric infra-red heaters.
All the birds in the collection receive a basic diet of Blue Cross
poultry food and corn. The pheasants are all fed pellets containing
a blackhead preventive and a daily ration of wheat ; in addition,
many species have a daily allowance of chopped fruit, minced
beef, maggots, and mealworms.
The eggs of some of the commoner species are hatched in electric
incubators but all those of the rarer forms are hatched under broody
bantams. All quail eggs are hatched in incubators.
When the chicks are dry they are transferred with the bantam to
an electrically heated coop with run attached. After a few days the
bantam is removed. The chicks are reared on turkey starter crumbs
containing a blackhead preventive. This is also the basic diet of the
breeding quail and francolins. In some cases the chicks are given
grated hard-boiled yolk of egg, chopped lettuce, mealworms, and
maggots in addition.
Disease has not, fortunately, been a major problem ; odd losses
have occurred from the following :--

The acquisition of these birds is perhaps the most important step
to date in the Trust's career. The stock of Mikados, Edwards's, and
Temminck's Tragopans kept at Leckford has for many years provided
the bulk of these species to be found in the world's collections today.
Your Council is most grateful to all those who have made this purchase
possible.
In order to safeguard these rare birds from possible destruction
from diseases such as fowl pest, it has been decided to disperse breeding
pairs about the country under the care of members with suitable
accommodation. The birds themselves, and any progeny reared,
will remain the property of the Trust.

PACKING GAME BIRDS FOR AIR SHIPMENT

By Dr. K. C. Searle (Hong Kong)
Very few importations of wild-caught pheasants have been made
since the second world war. With the renewed interest in pheasant
breeding, new importations are more probable and indeed are essential
if some species are to avoid hopeless in-breeding. The era of air
shipment for livestock is now beyond infancy and, if properly packed,
newly-caught birds can reach Europe from the Far East in 48 hours.
It is vital that they should be packed properly if they are to arrive
undamaged. The method to be described has been found entirely
successful in sending wild-caught birds from Hong Kong to England ;
no losses have been incurred during shipment and the general
principles of the method apply equally to Roulrouls or Argus.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96207075" page_id="56315541"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
I consider this to be more important than the provision of food.
Game birds are well known for their impossible wildness and only too
often one sees birds scalped or maimed by their own efforts, if badly
packed. Apart from padded roof and double netting the golden rules
here are one bird to a compartment. Never pack a pair of pheasants
in the same compartment or they will trample each other to death if
really alarmed. Only give a bird enough room to turn round and
not enough head room to jump. The ordinary roof of hessian or similar
material is useless for an air journey of any length. Space in aircraft
is limited and utilized to the maximum and someone, not realizing
the function of a sacking roof, will lash another crate on top. This
can be obviated by making a false roof of sacking 2 inches below the
plywood roof--the intervening space is filled with kapok or fine wood
shavings. Pheasants or partridges confined in a box fronted with large
mesh netting will damage beaks, ceres, and scalps by crashing into the
netting when frightened. Boxes should be fronted with a double layer
of netting ; the outside layer is ordinary \ inch mesh but the inner
layer, with which the bird makes contact, is of wire gauze. The front
can be half screened with muslin for highly nervous birds ; Argus and
Tragopans are usually sensible but I consider a screen essential for
Firebacks, Jungle-Fowl, and Roulrouls. Apart from the front, the box
is made of light plywood, the roof being padded as described and the
floor of netting with a tin bottom beneath this.
2. Adequate Food and Water Supply
Enough food and water is packed in each compartment for a five-
day journey ; the less interference with the crates the less alarmed
are the birds. Water is supplied in metal reservoir fountain drinkers
but these must be securely lashed in position with wire and should be

raised off the floor on a wooden shelf. Food is supplied in a deep
wooden trough, the construction of which is an integral part of the
box. Food and water supplied in this manner cannot be knocked
over, spilled, or easily soiled. Instructions must be supplied for further
servicing of the birds if they are delayed en route , but such is the
speed of air freightage that three days will see the birds safely delivered
from Hong Kong to quarantine quarters in the United Kingdom.

Reference has already been made to this aspect in considering the
type of food and water utensils. Of equal value is a grid floor of \ inch
wire netting. The jolting of aircraft on landing, etc., will spill water
from any type of container and provision of a false bottom ensures that
the birds remain dry. Scattered food and faeces are also out of contact
with the bird.

To avoid alarming the birds only the front of the box admits light
and with highly nervous birds even this is partially screened with
muslin. Stuffiness is avoided by the provision of air holes along side
and back.

In addition to such obvious matters as the name of the consignee
(there will be an air freight bill), clear instructions must be provided
for feeding and watering if delayed beyond five days, which end of
the crate should be stowed facing the light in the aircraft, and bold
admonitions to avoid delay.
The type of box used for a pair of Tragopans is shown in the
accompanying sketch. Inside measurements, i.e. the area occupied by
the bird and food containers, are 16 by 10 by 9 inches (high) for each
compartment. Dimensions will obviously vary with the species con-
cerned and the number of compartments can be varied to meet
requirements. For ease in handling and stowing no more than three
compartments to each crate is advised ; partridges are usually packed
in four-compartment boxes--two behind two. The dimensions of each
compartment used for various species is as follows :--
Argus : male, 23 by 14 by 12 inches (high) ; female, 23 by 12 by
12 inches (high).
Crested Fireback : 16 by 10 by 12 inches (high).
Roulrouls or other small partridges : 9 by 9 by 6 inches (high).
Removable doors are made in the back of each compartment and
these are nailed or screwed down when once the occupant has been
run in. If the birds are kept in holding cages with pull-up doors of
adequate size they can be packed without the upset of being handled.

Once the birds are crated no further adjustments can be made inside
the box ; all food, water, etc., must therefore be inside the container.
The last step is the introduction of the bird. If tail feathers, e.g. in
Argus, need trimming this can usually be achieved with a little care
when the bird has entered the box and the feathers are protruding
through the packing door.
Finally, it should be emphasized that birds must not be shipped
unless in good condition. I like to hold all birds for at least one month
before shipment. A varied and adequate diet to repair the emaciation
of previous mishandling and a prophylactic course of antibiotics and
soluble vitamins given in the drinking water assure that a bird is fit
to stand the stresses of shipment, quarantine, and removal to
permanent quarters.

THE AMERICAN QUAILS
(Tribe Odontophorini)
By J. Delacour (New York, U.S.A.)

<bodyText confidence="0.988206346153846" page_id="56315544"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
Although the American quails have been separated by many
authors in a special subfamily of the family Phasianidae, it seems
more logical to consider them as a mere tribe of the subfamily
Phasianinae, which includes also the Old World quails, partridges,
and pheasants. The guineafowls and the turkeys are better con-
sidered as forming two other subfamilies, Numidinae and Melea-
gridinae, as the differences between them and the other game birds are
more important. Farther removed yet are the Australasian Mound-
builders (Megapodiidae) and the tropical American Curassows and
Guans (Cracidae), two distinct families of game birds.
The American quails are generally similar to the Old World quails
and partridges, only possessing a stronger bill, the tip and edges of
which are sharp and serrated. There are some thirty-five species,
belonging to six genera, and they occur in the United States (one
species barely reaches Canada in southern Ontario), through Mexico,
Cuba, Central and South America, one genus reaching south as far
as Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. The south-western
United States and Mexico are their strongholds. All live under cover,
in forest, on wooded slopes and plains, or even in desert brush,
and a number are adapted to life at high altitude, as far as trees and
bushes will grow. The majority of them roost at night on trees and
shrubs, and all nest on the ground, laying numerous plain or spotted
eggs, pointed in shape like those of guineafowls and turkeys.
American quails never show gaudy colours ; they are usually brown
or grey elaborately and brightly marked and spotted with buff, yellow,
chestnut, white, and black, particularly on the head, throat, neck,

and underparts, and some are very beautiful. They have a short body
and a fairly long, broad tail with a few exceptions of very short tailed
birds. The head is often tufted or crested. The legs are moderate in
length and do not possess spurs. The sexes are more or less different,
sometimes similar.
American quails are excellent game birds, particularly those of the
open woodlands and scrub of the United States and Mexico. But
they require certain conditions to prosper. They are found, as a rule,
on rocky, sandy, or, at the least, light soil and they are intolerant of
stagnant humidity, heavy, soggy ground, and wet grass. None has
so far been successfully introduced into Europe, but the California
Quail is to-day well acclimatized and numerous in British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon, the Rocky Mountain states, New Zealand,
Chile, and the Hawaiian Islands ; so is the Bobwhite in the western
United States and south-western Canada. They do well in captivity
on sandy soil, or on wire netting and concrete floors. They soon perish
on moist, heavy soil. They are inclined to breed in confinement.
It is necessary to isolate breeding pairs, which can, however, be
associated with various passerine birds. They bother doves and
pheasants, and often prove aggressive toward other game birds. Grain
and green food constitute their main diet, to which high protein
pellets, hard-boiled egg, ground meat, and insects are added during
the breeding season. The chicks are usually easy to rear with the same
care and diet as other quails. The pairs take good care of their young,
but it is often safer and easier to hatch the eggs in an incubator and
to rear the chicks in a brooder. The incubation period is between
twenty-one and twenty-four days.
American quails form six genera, well defined by their shape and
proportions, colour pattern, and life habits.
I. Wood Partridges ( Dendrortyx)
These large Wood Partridges are characterized by their long tail,
small but strong bill, and rather small legs and feet. The feathers of
the crown are long and form a short occipital crest. They are rare
and confined to the mountain cloud forests of southern Mexico and
Central America. Three species and about eight subspecies are known.
Their plumage is rather sombre but well marked : upper parts olive
or rufescent brown, spotted, streaked with black, the hind neck striped
with chestnut ; underparts olive-grey, more or less streaked with
chestnut, whitish or dusky black ; head with crown feathers elongated
and forming a short crest when erected ; throat black, grey, or
white ; bill, bare skin around the eyes and legs red. Sexes alike.
The Bearded Wood Partridge (D. barbatus ) inhabits the moun-
tains of the State of Vera Cruz and is characterized by its grey chin
and throat, and its- uniformly chestnut breast.

The Long-tailed Wood Partridge ( Dendrortyx macrourus) has the
chin and throat black, and a grey breast streaked with blackish brown.
The five subspecies are found throughout the mountains of central
southern Mexico : D. m. macrourus (Vera Cruz) ; griseipectus (More-
los) ; diversus (Jalisco) ; striatus (western Jalisco to Michoacan) ;
oaxacae (Oaxaca).
The White-throated Long-tailed Partridge (D. leucophrys) has
white chin and throat. It is confined to the highlands of Central
America : leucophrys (Guatemala) ; nicaraguae (Honduras and
Nicaragua) ; hypospodius (Costa Rica).
These large American quails have not been kept in captivity to our
knowledge. It is due to the difficulty of obtaining them in their
native mountain forests. Very little is known of their life habits.
II. Western Quails ( Callipepla)
The six species of quails found in the western United States and
in Mexico are among the most attractive, therefore the most frequently
kept and bred in captivity. Although usually divided into four genera,
three of them with only one species each (monotypic), the great
similarity in their general proportions, colour-pattern, voice, and habits
makes it advisable to include them all in the genus Callipepla Wagler
1832. The genera Oreortyx (picta ), Lophortyx (californica, gambeli ,
douglasi ), and Philortyx (fasciata) are therefore considered synonyms
of Callipepla.
All Western quails have a short bill, a crest on the occiput, moder-
ately long legs, and a fairly long, broad, flat tail. The bill and legs
are black or dark brown. They all lay large clutches of eggs.
Plumed Quail (Callipepla picta)
The largest of the Western quails, almost the size of a Grey
Partridge, and the handsomest of all. Tail rather short and almost
square ; legs fairly short ; long toes ; a long upright crest of two
narrow black feathers. The sexes are alike, the female only slightly
smaller and duller. Crown, sides, back of neck and breast grey ;
forehead and chin white or buffy ; cheeks black, throat rich chestnut,
surrounded by a white line ; upper parts olive-brown ; sides chestnut
with broad white bars ; flanks reddish brown ; belly pale brown ;
under tail-coverts black ; iris brown. Young birds are brownish, the
juvenal plumage being worn only a short time ; downy chicks boldly
marked with buff and chestnut. Eggs cream to pinkish buff, unspotted,
ten to twelve in a clutch.
Plumed Quails inhabit forested mountains and chapparal covered
slopes. They are particularly fond of clearings where bushes have been
growing. They live mostly on the ground, nesting and usually roosting
on it. They seldom perch on trees, mostly when frightened. They
remain under cover and do not flush easily ; they are, therefore, not

easy to hunt and, although their flesh is excellent, they are not highly
regarded as game birds.
The species is divided into five subspecies, which differ only slightly
in the depth of their colours, and are of little interest for the avicul-
turist. Its range consists of the mountainous parts of California, the
adjoining states (Oregon, Washington, western Nevada), and Baja
California. They are found at fairly low altitudes in the north, but
above 2,000 feet elsewhere, and up to 9,000 feet ; all, however,
descend under 5,000 feet from September to April.
Plumed Quails are extremely elegant birds, much appreciated in
captivity. But they are not very easy to keep. Like many other
highland birds, they are intolerant of dampness and heavy soil, as
well as susceptible to germs. They do well in dry, sandy, or rocky
districts ; elsewhere they must be kept on concrete floors or on wire
netting. The young are rather delicate and need great care ; they
require the normal diet of other young quails.
California Quail (Callipepla californica)
This is a common species, the best known in captivity of the group.
Considerably smaller than the Plumed Quail, it differs not only in
shape and colour, but also in the fact that the sexes are different.
The male has a fairly long crest of spatulate feathers held forward
toward the bill ; forehead white streaked with grey ; eyebrows
white ; crown dark brown ; throat black bordered with a wide white
line ; sides and back of neck black spotted with pale grey ; upper
parts olive-brown ; the tail long and broad, dark grey ; wing like
the back, the tertiaries with broad buff lines ; flanks brown, lined
with white ; breast grey ; rest of underparts laced with black, the
middle of the upper belly yellowish buff, passing to chestnut on
the abdomen. The female has a shorter crest, no black or white on the
head, which is brown ; the throat is lined with whitish, the sides and
back of neck finely spotted, the breast brown like the rest of the
upper parts ; abdomen white laced with black. The first plumage of
the young is duller ; the chicks are marked chestnut brown and buff,
the eggs mottled with brown, resembling miniature turkey eggs.
California Quails constitute the most popular game bird of the
Pacific Coast, although they are rather reluctant to fly. They were
incredibly numerous when the country was first settled, and there
still are many at present. They live in the valleys and on mountain
slopes, up to 4,000 to 5,000 feet, wherever there is enough brush,
exceptionally higher, feeding mostly on seeds and leaves, to which
they add insects, particularly in the breeding season. They live in
flocks, except during the breeding season when they separate in pairs.
They lay large clutches, up to twenty eggs, but the broods are often
decimated by predators.

These quails adapt themselves readily to human settlement and are
found in gardens and orchards ; but they remain wary and wild.
Their voice is attractive and varied, their full call being : " who
are you ? "
There are several, not very different subspecies, varying only
slightly in size and depth of colour. The nominal race extends to
practically the whole of the coast and mountains of California except
the northern coastal area from the border of Oregon to Monterey
(brumescens). They occasionally meet Gambel's Quails on the edge of
the desert, and more often Plumed Quails on the mountains. Santa
Catalina Island has a larger race, and Baja California greyer ones.
California Quails have been successfully introduced into British
Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the
Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand, and Chile. They are very popular
in captivity and very easy to keep and to rear if dampness and heavy
soil are avoided.
Gambel's Quail (Callipepla gambeli)
This desert quail much resembles the California Quail, having the
same size and shape. It differs only slightly in plumage. The male
is of a lighter colour generally ; it has the crown chestnut, instead
of dark brown, the sides and back of the neck light grey streaked
with chestnut, the upper parts and breast of a paler tone of brown
and grey, and no lacing ; the upper abdomen is plain buff with the
centre black ; the sides are deep chestnut lined with white. The
female differs in the same way, being a more uniform grey, with plain
buffy underparts and chestnut and white sides ; the neck and throat
are less strongly marked. Young chicks much as in the California
species ; eggs similar, with darker markings.
Gambel's are the quails of the south-western desert, and they are
found, often in large numbers, wherever there is water, as they must
drink every day. On the border of the coastal ranges and the desert
they meet California Quails, and hybrids occur. They are partial to
mesquite and other desert brush. Both species are similar in life
habits if the difference in habitats are taken into account. Their
voices are only slightly different.
Gambel's Quails are abundant in suitable localities, but their
number varies greatly, from year to year, according to the rains.
They are found in south-western Utah, southern Nevada, Colorado
and New Mexico, south-western Texas, Arizona, California, east of
the coastal mountains, Baja California, and north-western Mexico.
They do well in captivity if protected from humidity.
Douglas' Quail (Callipepla douglasi )
Douglas', or Elegant Quail, resembles in general proportions and
shape the California Quail although it has a thicker bill, shorter legs

and tail. The crest is held backwards and the sexes are different.
The male has the head and throat spotted black and greyish-white ;
crest orange cinnamon ; nape and hind neck grey spotted with
chestnut ; back grey, wing-coverts and tertiaries chestnut striped with
white ; tail grey ; breast grey becoming spotted with white, the spots
large on the abdomen ; sides marked with chestnut and spotted with
white. The female is duller, with a shorter, sooty-brown crest ; top
of the head, hind neck and mantle dusky brown streaked and spotted
with buffy white, wings spotted brown and black, with buff lines ;
rump greyish brown ; underparts brown spotted and striped with
white, the throat streaked white and black.
Douglas 5 Quails inhabit the low, dry western districts of Mexico
from Sonora and Chihuahua to Jalisco. The northern subspecies
(bensoni ) (from northern Sonora) is paler, with a black throat and a
paler breast. It is the most often seen in captivity. A darker and
smaller race {teres) is found in Jalisco, and another one ( impedito )
from Nayarit ; a browner one ( languens ) inhabits western Chihuahua.
They frequent the dense brush of the tropical foothills, particularly
the thick second growth of cut-over forest, roosting a few feet above
the ground. They resemble otherwise the preceding species in
behaviour. They do well in captivity and have often been reared in
Europe and in America.
Scaled Quail ( Callipepla squamata )
This bird, often called the Blue Quail, differs from the preceding
species in its shorter, much broader, and thicker crest, the fluffy
feathers of which are slightly arched backwards ; the tail is rather
short and well rounded. The sexes are similar, the female only smaller
and slightly duller than the male. They are not as brightly coloured
as the quails mentioned so far : head and neck plain brownish grey ;
the crest feathers largely dull white ; upper back and breast bluish-
grey, laced with black, producing a scaly effect ; rest of upperparts
brownish-grey, the tertiaries with white bars ; belly yellowish, laced
with black (ochraceous and rusty chestnut in eastern race castaneo-
gastris) ; sides grey with large elongated white patches and brownish
border. Juvenals duller, and chicks chestnut and buffy, greyish under-
neath. Eggs white, very lightly marked with cinnamon buff.
Scaled Quails live in the dry canyons, plateaux, and plains with
grass, scattered trees, and bushes which are found between the moun-
tains of the highlands of the great arid interior of northern Mexico
and the south-western United States. They are met with in pairs or
covey, running among cacti and other desert vegetation, sometimes
with Gambel's Quails. They nest under bushes, in June or July,
when rains are occurring. They come to cultivated grounds when
not too much disturbed. They seem to eat more insects than other

species. They are terrestrial birds, with powerful legs, and they do
not often fly. They travel far to water, but often bathe in sand.
Their voice is a long-repeated " chip-chior 95 . They are hard to hunt
and not too much appreciated as game birds. They are widespread,
but never very abundant, and sedentary.
The western, paler race ( pallida ) occurs in southern Arizona, east
central Colorado, just reaching Oklahoma and Kansas, Texas, east
to ioo degrees L., north-western and central northern Mexico ; a
better coloured race ( castanogastris) lives in south-eastern Texas and
north-eastern Mexico, while the nominal race squamata inhabits
Mexico from southern Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Sonora to Mexico
City. They are easy to keep and to rear in captivity if protected from
humidity.
Banded Quail (CalMpepla fasciata)
A small quail, with a short, thick bill, a crest with four long,
narrow, black feathers tipped with chestnut, and a fairly long, almost
square tail ; brown above, the scapulars and tertiaries spotted with
sooty-black and barred with pale buff; back and tail brown speckled
with grey and barred with buff; throat greyish white ; upper breast
buffy brown ; rest of underparts regularly barred black and white,
the breast and sides brownish. Sexes similar. The immature has the
throat black.
This little quail lives on the open, bushy highlands of south-western
Mexico (Colima, Michoacan, Guerrera, Morelos, and Puebla), where
it is resident. Although more closely related to the other Western
Quail, it recalls the Bobwhites in certain habits, prefering to live in
dense weed patches, and roosting on the ground. It is often found
near cultivation, up to 5,000 feet, but is more numerous at lower
altitudes. It breeds mostly in August. Its staple diet is seeds.
Although they do well in captivity, these pretty quails are not often
kept and I can find no record of their breeding.

(Tragopan satyr a)
By F. E. B. Johnson (Bletchley, Bucks, England)
It is hard to say which is the most beautiful of the five species of
tragopans, beauty always being a matter of personal opinion. Certainly
the carmine red of the Satyr's breast is not surpassed in brilliance by
the colour of any of the others. A full description of all five species
is to be found in Delacour's Pheasants of the World , but mention can
be made of one or two further features of great beauty : the small
white spots, each surrounded by a black ring, which are distributed
over almost the whole of the plumage, and the large olive-brown
ocelli which are apparent on the wing-coverts, back and rump.
The Satyr Tragopan is a much larger bird than the more familiar
Temminck's Tragopan and the male of the former species is much
larger in proportion to the female than is the case with Temminck's.
The Satyr Tragopan is found in the wild in the Himalayas in dense
mountain woods and its range extends from a point west of Nepal
eastwards to a point east of Bhutan. As in the case of most other
pheasants, this is not really a very wide range, particularly when one
considers its limited habitat and the continued encroachment of
civilization on the mountain forests.
Although Satyr Tragopans have been bred regularly in captivity
since the close of the last century, there have been very few in England
since the last war and to the best of my knowledge there are less
than a dozen in the British Isles at the present time.
All tragopans require plenty of space. They must have sufficient
exercise and will keep in much better condition if they are able to find
insects and leaves to their liking in their aviary. My adult pair is
housed in an aviary approximately 40 ft. X 21 ft. X 5 \ ft. high with,
at one end, a shed open at the front. Like other pheasants they never
roost in it but it gives them a chance to get dry in the daytime after
it has rained or snowed all night. The aviary should be well planted
with shrubs and have an area of grass kept short.
My adult birds are fed as follows :--
Morning : Two to three handfuls of " Turkey Breeders Pellets "
mixed crumbly with skim milk, plus half an apple per bird (or
other fruit in season). Elderberries, blackberries, tomatoes, and
snowberries (Symphoricarpus alba ) are particularly appreciated.
Afternoon : One handful of wheat which has previously been
soaked for twelve hours (then rinsed clean, of course). The above
quantities are for a pair of birds.

Young tragopans need more careful feeding than many other I
pheasants but are not difficult to rear. They usually start feeding by
eating finely chopped pieces of lettuce leaf or hard-boiled yolk of egg.
These items should be scattered over a portion of " Turkey Starter "
or " Pheasant Rearing " crumbs mixed crumbly with skim milk.
Mealworms should also be given and I have found Satyrs more
partial to these than are Temminck's. At roughly three months of
age the young tragopans can be changed gradually from a starter to
a " Turkey Rearing 55 pellet and then at five months or so on to the
adult diet. The yolk of egg can be discontinued at the age of two weeks
but lettuce or other tender leaves should be given until the birds are
known to be eating grass. Fruit should be introduced when blackberries
are available in September.
My method of hatching and rearing is the same as I have described
for T. temmincki (Avi . Mag ., Nov.-Dee., 1959).
Generally speaking I found the Satyrs as easy to hatch and rear as
Temminck's. My pair of Satyrs was very prolific, the hen laid twelve
eggs, all in a nest on the ground in a clump of nettles, and every one
was fertile and hatched. Two of the chicks died before being moved
to the rearing coop and eight of the remainder were fully reared and
still survive. Needless to say the twelve eggs were incubated in five
different clutches.
The chick in down is distinguishable from temmincki by a noticeable
lack of " stop " at the base of the upper mandible. The newly-hatched
Satyrs are slightly larger than Temminck's and more " ginger " in
colouring.
The sexes can be distinguished at about three months of age by the
markedly darker colouring and finer vermiculations of the plumage
of the males. This is confirmed later by the appearance of red and black
on neck and head.
Some " do's " and " don't's " with Satyr Tragopans :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956670142857143" page_id="56315552"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
1. Do provide plenty of shade.
2. Don't take the bantam foster mother away from the young
until they are larger than she is.
3. Do provide fruit for the adults all the year round.
4. Don't overfeed the birds with corn.
5. Do remember that if there is not grass available all the time ;
they must be given tender green food.

Satyr Tragopans are one of the most beautiful of all birds and are
tame and confident with those who feed them. While they are not,
probably, in such imminent danger of extinction as several other
pheasants it is, nevertheless, very advisable to build up and maintain
a stock in this country while the opportunity is still with us.

(.Phasianus colchicus Linnaeus)
By Dr. James M. Harrison (Sevenoaks, Kent, England)
Abnormal plumages in the covert pheasant, Phasianus colchicus
Linnaeus, are well known and it has been thought that an account
of these and their causes, to the best of our present-day knowledge,
would not be out of place.
The covert pheasant is very prone to develop aberrant plumages
quite apart from the observable individual variations which depend
upon the very mixed genetic origin of this bird. This latter circum-
stance has tended to produce what might be termed an average type,
in which the various strains in its inheritance can be recognized as
blended, but it can also produce individuals which in their morphology
incline very strongly to some particular race, e.g. towards the extremely
pale Far Eastern forms P.c. satscheuensis or P.c.formosana , while the close
resemblance of the Melanistic Mutant Pheasant, P.c. var. tenebrosus
to the Japanese species P. versicolor is a very striking instance. In other
words, the individual variation of any individual may be along the
lines in which the racial characters form a mosaic or come to resemble
strongly one of the more extreme geographical forms.
This proneness to vary is favoured by the fact that our covert birds
must be recognized as rather in-bred, while it is equally true that
gallinaceous birds generally seem particularly liable to abnormalities
of one sort and another.
The gene complexity of the covert pheasant since its introduction
into Britain by the Romans has been greatly increased by the introduc-
tion subsequently of many different races and, in consequence of this,
by gene recombination a great variety of individuals showing combina-
tions of characters of their widely different ancestry are seen.
Apart from the above, in which we can detect what one may
describe as the normal genetic variation of the species, certain more
strikingly discontinuous variations are met with and it is possible to
make the following broad classification of such aberrations in
accordance with their believed causations.
i. Genetic
Under this heading may be mentioned pied individuals, or even
a state of total albinism including the irides or soft parts. This is
regarded as due to the recombination of recessive genes and can be
perpetuated by selective breeding. The pied state when affecting
iridescent parts such as the head and neck results in a leucistic or
greyish colour.

<bodyText confidence="0.997241333333333" page_id="56315554"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
The most striking example of a spontaneous mutation is, of course,
the Melanistic Mutant Pheasant, in which the hens and chicks are
also melanistic while a partial transient pied condition in the chicks
is of particular interest. This form also breeds true.
The other notable mutation of the species is that known as the
" Bohemian Pheasant ". In this variety the rich golden-red ground
colour of the cocks is replaced by a buffy-yellow colour, the feathers
being picked out in blackish, the result being a very handsome bird.
By selective breeding the stock can be maintained.

2. Gynandromorphism
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97857655882353" page_id="56315554"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
The condition of gynandromorphism in which an individual is
female as to one half of the body and male as to the other, the division
being in the long axis, has been met with in some finches and also in
the domestic fowl as well as in the pheasant.
It is at once clear from the more or less sharp division of the two
sides of the bird that this condition does not depend upon the influence
of hormones circulating in the blood and that some other explanation
is necessary. The most generally accepted theory is that which
postulates the loss of a sex chromosome at a very early division of the
nuclei. A further cause for the gynandromorphic individual is that
of a maldistribution of the somatic (body as distinct from the sex)
chromosomes which carry nuclei in excess of the normal numbers.
Such a case in a pheasant was described by C. J. Bond 1 and in
the course of time was reassessed by Huxley and Bond 2 in the light
of some recent research in which it was shown that not only was
there the striking plumage differences but that there was also a size
difference, the male half of the bird being larger than the female half
as determined by accurate measurements of the skeletal components.
These differentials of growth rates and size were disclosed by the
brilliant researches of four scientists---Juhn, Faulkner and Gustavson 3
and Lillie. 4
A gynandromorphic mosaic as distinct from a true mid-line division
into a half male and half female individual can result from a hormonal
influence and need not necessarily depend solely upon the presence
or absence of the respective sex hormones and this is discussed in the
next section.
The differential growth rate referred to above in cases of true
gynandromorphism also occurs in the individual feathers for in Bond's
pheasant referred to above one half of the tail feathers, the male half,
grew faster than the female half and, in consequence, the feather was
curved outwards instead of being straight.
3. Aberrations of Secondary Sexual Characters
In-breeding and an inherent instability of sex in birds accounts for
a number of abnormalities of plumage. Much experimental work has

morphism is under hormonal control, but in certain passeres the
plumage of the cocks is determined genetically. It is known, e.g. that
this is the case in the Gouldian Finch, Poephila gouldiae , while in the
familiar House-Sparrow, Passer domesticus , the only secondary sexual
character under hormone control is the bill colour of the male in the
breeding season, when testicular secretion transforms the yellowish
brown bill of winter into the jet black bill of summer.
The normal action of the internal secretion of the ovary in hens,
including pheasants, is to inhibit male plumage. In consequence of
this when this secretion fails, whether from experimental ablation or
from disease, or even just as a phasic imbalance of the endocrine
system, what has been referred to as the 44 Bisexual nature of the
hen 55 by Zawadowsky 5 is seen in operation, for often in such cases
a sex gland develops on the right side. In the majority of birds the
ovary is a single organ situated in the left side of the abdominal
cavity. The right-sided gonad which develops under the above
circumstances when examined microscopically is seen to be a mixed
gland containing both male and female elements and is termed an
4 4 ovo-testis Male sex hormone is also derived from the adrenals
which can add to the development of male-like plumage in such
cases.
Such 44 cocky-hens " were known as long ago as 1780 when the
famous surgeon, John Hunter, described the condition in a pheasant,
indeed there is a very early couplet which runs as follows :--
44 A whistling woman and a crowing hen
Are neither good for gods nor men."
The condition was attributed to disease of the ovary (tuberculosis)
and also to atrophy of the ovary from old age. This, however, was
only a half truth for a temporary swing from femaleness to maleness
can take place in quite young birds as a result of the fluctuations in
the supply of either male or female hormone. 6 When irreversible such
castrates, whether occasioned by design or disease, are invariably
grossly obese and are also altered insofar as their psychology and
behaviour is concerned. To the best of the writer's knowledge no
case of a complete, i.e. of a functional sex reversal has ever occurred
in the covert pheasant though, on theoretical grounds, there would
appear to be no reason why this could not happen, for such cases are
authoritatively recorded in the domestic fowl.
Cocky-hen pheasants are relatively common, while hen-feathered
cocks are far less so. Superficially these two aberrations are rather
similar as can be seen from the accompanying plates ; also the

similarity of both secondary sexual aberrations to the average normal
cock pheasant is apparent.
In origin, however, the aberrations are quite different for in the
case of the " henny-cock 55 the condition is not determined by a
failure of a sex hormone, but is brought about by the influence of
the secretion of the thyroid. Such cases were produced experimentally
by Zawadowsky. 7 Briefly, an excess of thyroxine brings about two
distinct modifications of plumage ; the first is an accentuation of the
dark feather markings resulting in an appearance of feminization, the
second is a bleaching effect on the ground colour producing a further
accentuation of contrast between ground colour and pattern. It is not
all the feathers that undergo these changes equally, and reference to
the plate shows that in effect a gynandromorphic mosaic has been
produced ; this is especially evident in the tail feathers, which should
be compared with those of the control normal cock and the cocky-hen.
It will at once be noticed that the lateral tail feathers in the henny-cock
are very heavily pigmented and are in fact over-feminized.
Another point of great interest is the fact that in the latter specimen
in the terminal part of the central tail feathers the character is again
female, even allowing for the somewhat heavier but nonetheless wider
spaced barring at the end of the tail of the normal cock. In fact in
the fourth left tail feather the gynandromorphic condition is even more
marked. Areas predominantly male and predominantly female can
be recognized and one can only conclude, on this evidence, that there
has, during the course of the development of this generation of
feathers, been a phasic endocrine imbalance induced by a dysfunction
of the thyroid an antagonism between the thyroids and gonads.
The thyroid is known to initiate moult and the gonads to inhibit
this process. The pseudo-feminization in this pheasant is the more
remarkable in that not only is the feather pattern altered towards the
typically female but even the shape is changed from the rather
lanceolate form in the male to the blunter ovate of the female : this
is particularly seen in the scapulars and on the mantles in the specimens
depicted.
While we have seen that in the female pheasant with atrophy of
the ovary a mixed male and female sex gland can develop on the
right side, ovarian elements can also be induced in the male if the
appropriate stimuli are applied very early in embryonic life. This
proves that the male too has a certain bisexuality which is, however,
very shortlived after which its sex is stable.
It would really seem that the answer to this curious anomaly must
lie in the individual feather papillae which may possess an intrinsic
bisexuality which can prove sensitive to hormone influences, being
affected by the absence of female hormone to maintain a semblance

of maleness or by thyroxine (thyroid secretion) to produce a pseudo-
female characterization.
It is the very marked differences in the sexual dimorphism of most
birds which makes them such ideal subjects for the study of secondary
sexual characters, and the covert pheasant may well be said to have
made a substantial contribution towards our knowledge of cause and
effect, both from the genetic and hormonal aspects, of this very
interesting subject.

There are two species of peafowl, Pavo cristatus , the Common or
Indian Peafowl of India and Ceylon and Pavo muticus, the Green
Peafowl of the area from Burma to Indo-China and southward to the
Malay Peninsula ; also Java.
The Common Peafowl inhabits fairly open country, preferably near
water, wherever there are trees in which to roost, and generally
below about 3,000 feet, though ranging to higher altitudes in southern
India. In places where it is held sacred it becomes tame and may
congregate around human habitations, but where hunted it is wary
and difficult to approach.
The food consists of various small animal life such as larvae, worms,
termites, lizards, frogs, and small snakes ; also seeds and other small
fruits and foliage. The male generally lives with several females, staying
about a favoured area, but sometimes moving off in search of favourite
fruits.

Nesting takes place on the ground, four to eight whitish or buffish-
white eggs, sometimes spotted at the larger end, being the clutch and
the incubation period is twenty-seven to twenty-nine days.
The white and the black-winged are colour forms of the Common
Peafowl, both apparently only occurring in captivity, the latter being
first mentioned by Latham in 1823. There are pied birds and a fertile
hybrid between the black-winged form and the Green Peafowl is
established in California where it is known as Spalding's Peafowl.
Pavo cristatus is hardy and generally stays well at liberty in parks
or large gardens where there are suitable trees in which to roost. It
sometimes does damage to plants, but it does find a certain amount of
natural types of food when kept at liberty, though some additional
food must be provided, particularly in winter. It will thrive in a large
well-drained aviary that has a grassed flight and can be fed either on
one of the high protein pellet foods used for domestic turkeys or on
a mixture of wheat, barley, maize, and biscuit meal containing meat
meal. Fruit, both fresh and dried (currants and sultanas being soaked
in water overnight), and green food such as lettuce, cabbage, spinach,
dandelion leaf, and lucerne should be provided. A little minced raw
lean meat can be given in place of the meat-meal impregnated biscuit.
Grit must naturally be provided.
The chicks can be reared on the " crumbs " used for turkey poults,
for this balanced food contains some Entramin which prevents histo-
moniasis (blackhead) to which peafowl chicks are rather susceptible.
Peters considers P. muticus as one form, but Delacour enumerates
three races, P. m. spicifer, the Burmese ; P. m. imperator , the Indo-
Chinese, and P. m. muticus , the Javanese, and says of them : "As
far as we can ascertain today from scanty material at hand a rather
dull bluish sub-species inhabits western Burma ; a greener, brighter
bird is found east of the Irrawaddy valley, extending to the China
Sea and probably south to the Isthmus of Kra, while a still more
brilliant and golden form lives in Malaya and Java."
He also says : "In habits Green Peafowl are much like Indian,
but they are wilder and more wary as a rule, probably because nowhere
protected by religious scruples. They are fiercer and stronger, more
brusque in their actions. Locally common when suitable conditions
exist and if they have not been destroyed by man, they require open
spaces such as river banks, clearings, and park-like country with
long grass, patches of jungles, and trees in which they can rest and
hide. They shun deep unbroken forest and large open plains, being
absent from the great cultivated deltas of the Irrawaddy, the Menan,
the Mekong, and the Red River. Also they do not ascend mountain
slopes above 4,000 feet, although numerous just below that altitude.
They are often found in small groups composed of an adult male,

a few females, and young during the spring and summer, but they
gather in big flocks in autumn and winter."
The Green Peafowl is not so hardy and should be shut in when
frost is expected. Males are usually aggressive, often attacking human
beings.
The diet in captivity is that advised for the Common Peafowl and
for the reasons already stated, this species should be kept in a large
aviary, not at liberty.

HONEY BEE LARVAE {Apis mellifera, L.) FOR
BIRD FOOD

Studies concerning insectivorous birds in captivity have been

handicapped by the problem of obtaining adequate diets for rearing
and maintaining such birds. Behavioral studies are especially
dependent upon the state of health of the birds. The collection of
insects from the field for bird food can be extremely time-consuming
and expensive. Although insectivorous birds in nature feed on a wide
array of insects, their nutritional requirements in captivity apparently
may be satisfied by supplying them with a few species. According to
Naether (1955), live ant eggs (pupae ?) are in themselves a complete
food for soft-billed birds. Such insects may be fed alone or blended
with other food supplements.
Insectivorous birds obviously are adapted physiologically to the
nutritional elements comprising insects. There are probably certain
amino acids, trace elements, vitamins, and other growth factors,
which render insects more desirable nutritionally than the most
elaborate laboratory food containing a great variety of such substances.
It is recognized commonly that insectivorous birds are benefited by
a diet containing some living insects. Perhaps this effect is partially
" psycho-somatic
Many factors influence the suitability of various insects for laboratory
rearing. Variations in disease resistance, length of life cycle, culture
maintenance expense, and yield of consumable insect material dictate
to a large degree those species which are chosen for this purpose.
Aside from rearing problems, the size and general appearance of the

insects might be important factors controlling their acceptance by
some insectivorous birds. Methods of rearing several other insect
species will be the subject of a later paper (Ficken and Dilger, in Press).
Hocking and Matsumura (i960) have recognized the potential
value of bee larvae for human consumption. According to Hans Lohrl
(personal communication), bee larvae as well as wasp larvae were
used successfully as bird food supplements. However, extensive
utilization of bee larvae has been handicapped because efficient
techniques for harvesting the larvae have not been developed.
Consequently a co-operative project was initiated by the Laboratory
of Ornithology and the Department of Entomology to investigate the
production of bee larvae in quantity, to improve the techniques of
rearing and harvesting, and to make preliminary observations on the
acceptance of these larvae by a few birds.

Experimental Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992585296296296" page_id="56315564"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
Small honey bee colonies were used for the production of larvae,
since the problems of manipulation were reduced to a minimum with
very little sacrifice in brood production. The size of the colonies
arbitrarily was limited to five standard Langstroth frames of dark
brood comb. Six colonies were established by installing 5 pounds
of bees with an Italian queen into each colony. After the queens
began to lay eggs, manipulations were started to concentrate brood
rearing in single combs in order to facilitate harvesting. Queens were
located and confined on individual frames of comb by means of a
five-mesh wire hardware cloth cage (any type of queen excluder
material would be equally satisfactory). Thereafter the queens were
kept in their respective cages for the duration of the experiment. Every
fourth day a frame of empty, dark brood comb which was suitable for
egg-laying was placed into the cage, thus providing the queens three
days in which to fill each comb with eggs. Combs of eggs were placed
outside the cage within the colony where they were maintained by
the worker bees until the larvae were sufficiently mature to harvest.
Harvest Technique
Before larvae can be harvested by any technique it is necessary to
remove the caps of sealed cells. This can be done by carefully shaving
away the cell caps with a thin, finely serrated knife. The uncapping
process seems easier if the brood comb is chilled momentarily in cold
water just prior to uncapping.
In the past the conventional harvest technique has been the removal
of individual larvae from honeycomb cells using small forceps. Hocking
and Matsumura (i960) recently suggested an improved technique
known as the swing and impact method. The frame of brood comb

is swung downward so that one end of the frame edge collides with a
block. The impact dislodges larvae which fall on to a collecting tray.
Both of these techniques were briefly tested in this laboratory. It was
found that older larvae which contributed most to the yield were very
difficult to remove from the cells.
A water removal technique was developed which proved very
efficient in removing all of the larvae from the cells. Larvae normally
lie in the bottoms of their cells, adhering to sticky beds of milky brood
food. By standing a comb on one end and spraying a stream of water
over the comb surface, the bed of food is diluted or washed away while

the water pressure simultaneously forces the larvae from their cells
(see Figure). They fall a short distance on to a cheesecloth supported
by a wire grid. Here they are washed free of food and may be fed
immediately to the birds or preserved by freezing.
After the combs are washed free of larvae and nectar, and the
water is shaken from the cells, the combs are ready to be placed into
the colony for further brood production. Such dark brood combs
free of all brood and honey are very attractive to queens, encouraging
maximum oviposition.
Timing the Larval Harvest
Larvae may be harvested approximately nine to eleven days after
the queen begins laying in the comb. They are extracted most con-
veniently just prior to the capping of the cells. However, larval weight
increases very rapidly at the time the cells are sealed and shortly
thereafter. Thus, it is more efficient in terms of the mass of harvested
food to delay larval removal until the youngest larvae are just being
capped. The Table indicates the differences obtained by harvesting
ten days after queen confinement rather than nine days.

It is possible for each colony to produce approximately one pound
of larvae every six days. Production is usually possible from late
spring to early fall in temperate climates. This period corresponds
to the most active nesting season of birds and consequently would be
a convenient source of living insect material for immature birds.
The nutritive value of bee larvae is indicated from preliminary
analyses by Hocking and Matsumura (1960). The average percentages
(wet weights) for fat and protein were found to be 3 * 71 and 15*4 per
cent respectively for mature larvae. Notably high values were found
for vitamins A and D. Vitamin D was found in concentrations of
6,130 to 7,430 I.U./G. wet weight, compared to 100 to 600 I.U. in
cod liver oil.

Observations have been made at the Cornell University Laboratory
of Ornithology concerning the feeding of birds with bee larvae. Paul
Mundinger (personal communication) found that young American
Goldfinches, Spinus tristis , taken from the nest at about the time of
fledging (twelve to fifteen days) took bee larvae from forceps almost
exclusively the first day, while refusing to eat voluntarily a mash
mixture when it was presented to them. On the following days mash
was eaten voluntarily but bee larvae still seemed to be preferred. As
the birds grew older the amount of bee larvae was reduced until
at three weeks of age they each received approximately six larvae
per day. At this time they were husking and eating seeds, which
then formed most of their diet, although some still seemed to prefer
the larvae.
One of the authors (Stein) has successfully used bee larvae as the
base of a mix for hand-raising Traill's Flycatchers Empidonax traillii.

<bodyText confidence="0.999548222222222" page_id="56315567"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
The adult bee population dwindles rapidly in the summer, owing
to a short life span of approximately six weeks. During long-term
production of larvae, steps must be taken to ensure an adequate
population in the colonies since larval nutrition and oviposition
activity are dependent on population. An adequate colony population
can be maintained by allowing some brood to complete development
by the addition of emerging brood or by the addition of adult bees in
queenless packages which are usually available commercially by
the pound.
Bee larvae seem ideal for bird food. They are succulent, do not
have spiny or bulky cuticular material, and are not known to contain
offensive protective secretions. Larval food is composed entirely of
pollen, honey, and nutritious secretions similar to royal jelly. The
life cycle variations are very small, enabling precise control over
timing larval harvest. During periods when larvae are not needed the
colonies are largely self-sufficient. Beekeeping equipment is generally
economical and is placed in the field, thereby freeing laboratory space.
Manipulations are quite simple and can be learned in a short time.
Several excellent references are available on bee culture (Eckert and
Shaw, i960 ; Grout, 1949 ; Root, 1954). The chief disadvantage
in rearing bee larvae is the fear of stings but this objection is a minor
one if routine precautions are observed.
The ultimate value of honey bee larvae for bird food can be
determined only by extensive feeding tests with many bird species.
These larvae may have similar utility as a food for certain reptiles,
fish, and small mammals which are held in captivity for behavioral
studies.

A specimen of the Indian Blue Robin or Blue Chat (Luscinia brunnea ),
presented by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark, is the first of this
species to be in the collection. As can be seen from the good coloured
illustration in Salim Ali's Indian Hill Birds, the name is not appropriate,
for the male is slate coloured above and pale rufous beneath with a
white stripe above the eye and on either side of the throat. The female
is brown, paler beneath. The tail is moved in a characteristic Redstart
manner.
There are two races, the one referred to being the nominate race
which breeds in the Himalayas between about 5,500 and 11,000 feet
and winters in the foothills and as far southward as Ceylon, and
L. b. wickhami which is resident about Mount Victoria in the Chin
Hills and in which the male is a little paler and smaller and the female
dull slaty-blue above instead of brown.
Other arrivals of especial interest are two White Storks, a young
pair of Green Peafowl bred in Fifeshire by Mr. Tom Spence and
presented by him, together with an Orange-breasted Green Pigeon
and a Uganda Green Pigeon ; a Kenya Eagle-Owl and a Yellow-
plumed Honey-eater (Meliphaga ornata), the first to be received since
more than fifty years ago.
Dr. J. G. Harrison, Merriewood, St. Botolph's Road, Sevenoaks,
Kent, would be grateful for the heads of pheasants in order to study
the skull pneumatisation.

The seventy-second meeting of the Club was held at the Rotary
House Club, 21 Portman Square, London, W. 1, on Wednesday,
nth January, 1961, following a dinner at 7 p.m.
Chairman : Mr. K. A. Norris.
Members of the Club : Miss P. Barclay-Smith, P. S. Bates, A. W.
Bolton, Miss K. Bonner, W. Brain, W. D. Cummings, B. Dittrich,
M. D. England, Miss R. Ezra, Colonel H. B. Finch, Mrs. O. L. Gent,

Way re.
Members of the Club, 32 ; guests, 15 ; total, 47.
The Club is very fortunate in having Kenneth Norris as its new
Chairman. The happy manner in which he introduced the speaker for
the evening showed that he is destined to act in this capacity with
considerable distinction.
E. N. T. Vane gave a commentary on a series of Kodachromes
projected by A. W. Bolton. The slides were selections from their two
very extensive collections and illustrated " Meanderings of an
aviculturist with a camera ". The majority of Vane's slides were
of birds that are, or have been, in his own collection, such as lutino
and blue Ring-necked Parrakeets, lutino Nyasa Lovebirds, Black-
headed Caiques, young Splendids being hand-fed, a Yellow-cheeked
Amazon that had been hatched and reared by a Grey Parrot a pet
Tawny Owl, etc. Vane has a collection of some 800 slides of
coloured plates of the Psittacines and several of these were projected
to demonstrate the differences in the various forms of island King
Parrakeets ; a group he is at present studying.
We were also shown numerous photographs taken at the Wildfowl
Trust, the London Zoo, various bird shows, Miss Knobel's unique
lutino Black-headed Caique, Bolton's own pair of Baillon's
Toucanettes, and many others. Altogether a very enjoyable and
instructive programme.
The next meeting of the Club is on Wednesday, 8th March, 1961.

In The Scotsman, 3rd December, i960, T. H. Gillespie, for so many
years Director of the Zoological Park, Edinburgh, reports the death
of a Griffon Vulture after being in the Zoo for over forty-six years.
It was, in fact, the Zoo's oldest inhabitant. As it was fully adult
when it arrived its age could not have been much less than fifty years.
This is likely to be a record age for a vulture of this species.

Paul Schneider is, of course, primarily a breeder of Psittacines,
but he is also interested in pheasants. Last year his Satyr Tragopans
produced five young ones, two males and three females. The female
laid a total of seventeen eggs over a period of ninety days. Two eggs
were broken by being laid from the perch and one was broken by
an unsteady sitting hen. One chick was hatched on 9th May, two on
5th June, one on 15th June, and one on 8th July. All fourteen eggs
were fertile ; six embryos died on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth
day of incubation.

Lloyd B. Thompson, British Columbia, writes : " My Prince
Lucien's Conures reared six young this year. The hen laid six eggs,
all fertile, and hatched and reared them all with less trouble than
most. They are fantastically tame and we have really enjoyed them.
American breeders say they have never been bred on this Continent."
The Prince Lucien has been described as " common in captivity
and easily reared ". But actually Pyrrhura picta lucianii is very rare,
and such records as exist almost undoubtedly refer to the Red-bellied
P. frontalis frontalis. The breeder has sent an excellent photograph
of the six young ones and there is no mistake about correct identifica-
tion. This success is in all probability a world " first ".

Beautiful Sunbird : " Unlike the Senegal sub-species, there is no

The Squadron-Leader now tells me that this statement was based
on the authority of Mackworth-Praed and Grant and is not, in fact,
correct. At the time of writing there had not been a specimen
in the Edward Marshall Boehm collection sufficiently long to disprove
this. But " now we can as our specimen here has gone out of colour
but has retained the elongated tail-feathers and the metallic-green

Tom Spence writes : " During the summer I received a most
remarkable pair of Bar-shouldered Doves, which laid within ten days
of importation and have never been without eggs or young in the
nest since. They reared three fine broods but unfortunately three
young were killed and the male badly injured while brooding the
fourth set of eggs, by a weasel that had squeezed into the aviary.
I had quite a tragedy last week (end of October) when five out of
seven of a group of wing-clipped, eighteen-month-old Green Peafowl
were killed by probably an escaped mink or ferret. They were in
an open enclosure of about an acre and roosted on a great pile of
boughs which I suppose would give such a predator an ideal oppor-
tunity. One Vulturine Guineafowl was killed in the same manner
in a neighbouring enclosure. The five other Green Peafowl of the
same age were at full-winged liberty and, of course, were safe as were
the older birds in their aviaries.
A newcomer is of some interest--a Green-backed Trumpeter ;
the first I have seen of its kind. It was sent to me as a Grey-backed
and the dealer even went so far as to certify it as Psophia crepitans. It is
a very fine bird in very good condition. The colour reminds me

Paul Hansen, Odense, Denmark, reports : " I have had quite a
good breeding season. Crimson-winged, six reared ; first nest four
eggs, four hatched, one young one died after about two days but
the other three grew up into very nice birds after being hand-reared.
Each year the hen starts to neglect her first young about eight to
eleven days after hatching, so this year I brought them in at the first
sign. A fortnight later she went to nest a second time and again
laid four eggs ; thrf &apos; hatched, the fourth containing a well-developed
chick. This brood ne hen, as usual, reared unaided. She has behaved
in this manner (very year she has been breeding with me. Why
does she do it ?
One pair of Princess of Wales reared a nest of seven young. The
hen had five eggs of her own, to these I added the eggs of a second
hen which got badly egg-bound with her third egg. A short time after
the youngsters left the nest the hen nested again ; three eggs, all
hatched, but only one young one lived to leave the nest.
One pair of Splendids had two young : one, a female, is a very
peculiarly coloured bird, a kind of pastel shade, nothing like the colour
of a normal Splendid. Fortunately the other, a male, grew up and is
becoming a very nice bird. The old male died so I propose mating
the two next season, just to see what, if anything, turns up. Another
pair of Splendids reared only one. Three young reared by four
pairs may be considered a very meagre result. Elegants did nothing,
and Leadbeaters, Amazons, and two other pairs of Princess of Wales
followed their bad example."

treatises in the German language (under the general title " Das

among the earlier issues, have been devoted to avian families.

represented by fourteen genera. The usual division into two sub-
families is not recognized, the Ground Hornbills ( Bucorvus ) not being
separated from the remainder.
An introductory chapter deals with general topics, with a short
section on anatomy, a distributional map, a section on ethology,
and a very useful catalogue of parasites known from hornbills. This
chapter ends with a commentary on the systematic position and
probable evolution of the family and a short reference to the single
known fossil form, the Eocene Geiselornis. Then follows a key for the
easy identification of the fourteen genera.
The largest genus Tockus, with fourteen species, is then treated
systematically, each species being briefly described and its distribution,
biotope, migration, food preferences, and reproductive behaviour
recorded so far as it is known. The same procedure is followed with
all the other genera and species, and in many cases there are additional
comments in an appendix.
Illustrations are clearly drawn sketches depicting the specific,
sub-specific and, where applicable, sexual differences rendering
identification easy without resort to colour. There are also excellent
maps showing the distribution of each form.
A bibliography of fourteen pages concludes the volume. The volume
is to be highly commended as a work of reference though clearly
intended more for the scientific specialist than the aviculturist.

FUGITIVE REACTIONS IN AVIAN BEHAVIOUR. By Martin

Markgren. Acta Vertebratica, Vol. 2, No. 1. Zoological
Department, Nordiska Museet and Skansen, Stockholm, i960.
The author describes and discusses the behaviour shown by birds to
escape or avoid things, both animate and inanimate, that are or might
be harmful or frightening to them. He has read widely and carefully
on the subject and also made long and careful personal observations
of birds in the field in Sweden and elsewhere.
Those who accuse bird behaviour students of preferring the use of
esoteric jargon to plain English may find here some ammunition for
their guns. Others may not agree with all the definitions that the
author proposes or accepts. The reviewer, for example, considers it
misleading to use the term " mobbing 55 only if the " mobbing " has
not been provoked by hostile action. This would entail calling the
demonstration of a pair of Chaffinches against a Jay that had alighted
by chance near their nest as " mobbing ", yet using some other term
for exactly similar behaviour by another pair of Chaffinches towards a
Jay which was actually searching for their nest.
However, such minor criticisms must not put anyone off reading this

work which, especially where the author is dealing with his own
observations and experiments, provides a great deal of information
clearly presented and cogently discussed.
Among other things we learn that all short-necked birds do not
signify " hawk " and elicit escape reactions in smaller species ; that
the Pine Grosbeak, like some other northern birds, has no fear of man
although it reacts just as strongly as most species to some predatory
mammals and to birds-of-prey. That birds that are not frightened of a
walking or standing man will often flee if he makes a throwing move-
ment towards them is well known but, unlike others, the author has
made repeated and painstaking experiments on this and other aspects
of birds' fear of man. He shows that, at least in the wild populations of
gulls and crows which he studied, it is the speed and acceleration, not
the throwing movement in itself, that causes fear. Also certain arm
movements that cause gulls to take wing do so because of their
resemblance to the slow wing beats of a flying eagle.
All who are interested in bird behaviour should read this book and
aviculturists will probably find much in it that can also be of practical
use in connection with keeping or taming birds.

TAWNY OWLS TAKING PARTRIDGES?

I would be very grateful for advice on how to solve a problem concerning what
I believe to be Tawny Owls, a pair of which has lived and nested near my garden
for some years.
A wire-netting fence of i in. mesh, buried i ft., stands 7 ft. high round three sides
of my garden enclosing, with the house end--a high brick wall--as the fourth side,
about three-quarters of an acre of lawn, shrubbery, and a small pool. There are no
signs of rats against which traps and Warfarin bait are continuously set.
In this enclosure are a collection of waterfowl, ranging in size from Teal to Ruddy
Sheldduck, Chinese and Golden Pheasants and--and here comes my problem--*
Partridges. All the birds are tame and, of course, pinioned.
Everything lives in peace and security except the Partridges, of which I introduced
the first pair last year. Within a few weeks I found first the one and then the other
killed. One corpse was near the surrounding wire in open, short grass and the other
in the middle of a lawn. Each was decapitated, the head a few inches from the
corpse and a little bunch of feathers, presumably caused by the " kill ", a foot or so
away. In each case the flesh had been neatly torn from the breast starting from the
neck.
Last June I introduced two more pairs. Very soon I found a similar corpse, shortly
after that one was found drowned, and it was not long before the remaining two
followed the first one. The same fate has overtaken two more put into the garden
in October and one pheasant poult in July.
I have some more equally tame Partridges in covered runs but do not want to
submit them to the same hazard.
Are there any means of combating this menace ?

SOME ADVERSE COMMENTS ON THE NATIONAL SHOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995185756756757" page_id="56315576"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
We shall, I doubt not, see eulogies of the Olympia show in print. Indeed, I saw
much deserving of praise on my two visits to the show. The fine condition of most of
the exhibits and the obvious care that had been taken to make most of the " British
Softbills " comfortable in their roomy show cages, for examples.
Nevertheless, there was much that could and did bring Aviculture into disrepute.
First, the dealers' stands. One of these was really the worst of its kind that
I have ever seen ; not excluding the bird shops of Beirut and Cairo, and
Sclater Street on a Sunday morning. Blossom-headed Parrakeets packed almost
like sardines ; Glossy Starlings equally overcrowded, their drooping wings
plastered with excrement ; sick and dying tanagers (one escaped but was easily
recaptured as it scuttered over the floor too weak to fly) ; these were but three of
many cages most of which held equally miserable captives. The other dealers'
stands were very much better but each had some birds that should never have been
publicly displayed. At one a Black-capped Waxbill, recognizable as such only by its
bill coloration, was bare except for wing and tail quills aud many of its comrades
(it was in a cage with very many other waxbills and finches) were only a little less
pitiable in condition. At another a huddled crowd of very sick and sorry-looking
zosterops and two extremely bedraggled sunbirds were, when I saw them, attracting
adverse comment from three well-known ornithologists.
Innocent aviculturists and dealers will probably suffer as a result of this. Many
members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the R.S.P.G.A. visited
the show and I should be surprised if some of them do not try to get the import
and keeping of foreign birds prohibited as a result of what they saw.
To those who know nothing of bird-keeping the British finches and buntings
in their minute cages give a very bad impression. It is no use the apologists of bird
shows saying glibly " but everyone knows the birds are not kept in those little show
cages Everyone does not know this and the " British Hardbills " section of this
show makes many fervent enemies for the keeper of British species.
Personally I am somewhat hardened to the cruelties of the bird trade and realize,
anyway, that its worst excesses have never caused such suffering as is entailed in the
production of our Sunday joints and breakfast bacon. I was most horrified I think

of birds.

The President's Medal was instituted in 1955 to enable the Council to
confer conspicuous honour on those members whom it might from time to time
consider deserving of special honour at the hands of the Society.
The knobel Award
The Knobel Award was instituted in i960. It will be awarded from time
to time, at the discretion of the Council, to members of the Society resident
overseas, for breeding successes meriting special recognition.

Certificate of Merit
The Certificate of Merit was instituted in i960. It will be awarded from
time to time, at the discretion of the Council, to Zoological Societies, Pheasant and
Waterfowl Trusts, etc., in recognition of meritorious success in breeding and rearing
birds in captivity.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.

(.Afropavo congensis (Chapin))
By F. J. Appelman (The Hague, Holland)
In 1959 the Antwerp Zoo acquired three pairs of the Congo Peacock
from Mr. Cordier. The Director, Mr. Van den bergh, whose main
object was to give the precious birds the best chance, spread the risk
by giving one pair to Monsieur Delacour at Cleres and one pair to
the Rotterdam Zoo.
The Rotterdam Zoo, was of course, very much honoured and we felt
the more happy when, on 24th August, i960, we were able to announce
to Mr. Van den bergh the hatching of two Afropavos.
When we received this precious pair at the end of 1959, we housed
them in an aviary in the Victoria regia hothouse, where the tempera-
ture fluctuates from 22*-27* C. and where the humidity is always
very high. We planted the aviary in such a way as to more or less
resemble a tropical forest.
At first the birds were very shy and always hid among the bushes,
but after some weeks they grew tamer, and after some months they
became very quiet and even accepted mealworms from the hand.
In April, i960, they became more active and started displaying,
both birds spreading their tails in the same way as Peacock Pheasants.
The birds preferred to perch on the small trees which we had planted
in their house. On the 10th May we found a crushed egg under a tree,
and next day a broken egg. Then it dawned on us, that the hen would
only lay in a tree-nest and that the eggs had fallen on the ground as
there was no room for a proper nest. We therefore put a basket in
their willow-tree, and this immediately received the attention of the
hen.
On 1st June, i960, there was an egg in the basket and the next day
a second. The hen started brooding, lying very flat on the eggs, and
remaining so still and silent that we often wondered if she was still

alive. On 16th June to our great disappointment we found the clutch
broken on the ground ; this clutch proved to consist of three eggs, all
containing embryos. We never discovered the cause of this calamity.
Fortunately on 22nd July, i960, the hen started laying again and
after she had laid a second egg on the following day, she very seldom
left the nest. Later on, we found that the clutch contained three eggs.
On 22nd August the hen became a bit restless and maybe one of
the eggs had already hatched on that day, but we dared not disturb
her. On the morning of 23rd August we saw two chicks on the
edge of the nest, one of which let itself fall down, the other remaining
with the mother. The cock at once ran to the chick that had come down,
and behaved completely like a hen, warming the chick under his
breast and wings and showing the little creature how to look for food.
The next day, 24th August, the hen came down with the second
chick and from that moment both parents cared for their offspring.
We got the impression that the chick that left the nest first, preferred
to stay with the cock, but that is only an impression. The third egg
contained a dead chick.
The Afropavos did not feed their young with the bill like Peacock
Pheasants, but we observed the chicks took the food from the bills of
their parents.
The eggs of the Afropavo are somewhat large in proportion to the
size of the hen and the chicks are very vigorous and can fly in two or
three days. They prefer to spend the night up in the trees, under the
covering feathers of their parents. Unfortunately one of the chicks
died of coccidiosis on 9th September, but the other one has grown up
to a very fine young hen, which has already become very jealous of its
mother.
About 1940, Afropavo was bred in the Congo in the aviary of a
private person. The result, however, was extremely poor, for the only
chick which hatched died after a few days.
In June, i960, the Antwerp Zoo again got some Afropavos from
Mr. Cordier and the Zoo now possesses four pairs, two pairs are kept
at Antwerp, and the other two pairs in the annex Plankendael at
" Muizen ".
As, in our opinion, the breeding of Afropavo does not seem to be in
any way more difficult than the breeding of many other gallinaceous
birds, we hope that in the near future the species may be seen in many
collections. In this event, the chances of preventing the extinction
of these interesting birds will be increased.

(Uranornis ruber )
By A. H. Isenberg (Portola Valley, California, U.S.A.)
These birds come from the islands west of New Guinea. Six years
ago I was fortunate in obtaining three of them. It seemed at the time
that two were females, one being in first year plumage. The second
year one of the " females " showed distinct horn growth, which only
males have, and two years later produced his first-year plumes and the
next year was fully plumed like the older male. This younger male
was a most amusing bird, quite noisy and clownish, as he would dance
by the hour, leaping back and forth on one branch and snapping at
the branch's end until, after months of this behaviour, he had actually
polished the last inch tip of the branch. Unfortunately this bird
died of a head injury this spring (i960).
Up until last May neither male would tolerate the female so all
three were in separate aviaries. The older male was without heated
shelter and never the worse for weather all through winter with
temperatures down to 28* F. several nights and heavy rains, etc.
In May I put the older male and female together in an aviary,
approximately 40 feet by 20 feet and 10 feet high, planted with bamboo,
fig, and two thick Japanese plum trees, and a good-sized lawn, plus
the shelter (unheated) approximately 10 feet by 10 feet by 8 feet high.
The pair got along quite well here, and by 4th July the female
had built a nest of dry leaves and twigs in one of the thick parts of a
plum tree, about 8 |feet from the ground. The nest was boat-shaped
rather than round and lined longitudinally with fine bamboo and
grass stems. Two eggs were laid (beautiful eggs, pale fawn with, if
anything, a pinkish wash and streaked with reddish brown). The eggs
are much larger at one end. I managed to save one, the other
disappeared.
The female alone sat steadily from 8th July to early August before
I took the egg and found it infertile. John Griswold from the
Philadelphia Zoo blew out the egg for me.
The male was already in moult when the female started laying,
but the female only began moulting in September. The male now is,
once again, in full feather and very beautiful. The male completely
ignored the female and the nest.
A few days after I took the egg the nest was destroyed and the female
carried a few sticks and leaves but then abandoned any further attempt.
It is hoped that next year the nest will be built in May or June,
while the male is still in full plumage.
I would appreciate any comments on the moulting and nesting of

My pair of Lesser Birds of Paradise are in the largest aviary, a
veritable jungle of bamboo and other trees, but did nothing. This
is their first season in this aviary. Perhaps next year ? They, too,
moulted like the Reds, the male first, by two months.
My little King Bird of Paradise completed his moult in August.
Anyone knowing of a female King available, please do write me,
as I have a perfect greenhouse breeding zone for them.

<bodyText confidence="0.997570848484848" page_id="56315634"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
By Claude M. Payne (Barford, Warwickshire, England)
For a full and authoritative description of the species I would refer
readers to the paper by Arthur A. Prestwich in the July/August,
1955, number of the Magazine and content myself with a report on
one pair of White-bellied Caiques (Pionites leucogaster leucogaster ).
I would stress that I am not unaware of the fact that often it is the
exception which proves the rule. However, it will not be amiss, I think,
if I remind readers that Caiques, as a group, inhabit the lower reaches
of the Amazon where the atmosphere is extremely humid and the
temperature high--a most unhealthy climate for humans by any
standard.
This particular pair of Caiques came to me through the good offices
of a fellow member some five years ago. The first year, as they were
in juvenile plumage, was spent indoors in a roomy standard type
parrot cage, where they had a fairly good moult. During the following
summer they were put out into an aviary in the garden. By a series
of unexplained delays on my part the birds were allowed to remain
in quarters which one would have thought very inadequate. However,
as the birds appeared to be enjoying the fresh air and exercise (in
point of fact they took a bath even when the temperature was below
freezing point) I felt disinclined to remove them to the birdroom where,
in the usual way, they would have spent the winter in a temperature of
50* Fahrenheit.
The Caiques undoubtedly flourished with this spartan treatment
and took on a new bloom which has never left them. They only used
the shelter, to which they had access through a nine-inch aperture,
for feeding purposes and even in the most bitter weather they were ever
ready to receive a titbit in the form of a peanut, grape, or mealworm.
Although Caiques are noted for their strident voices, at these times
they only uttered the harsh growl of pleasure.
During this particular winter we experienced every kind of weather
from frost and snow to winter sunshine, but at no time was there the
slightest sign of depression or ill-health. The birds often perched with

their feathers away from their bodies, but this is the normal way birds
have of insulating themselves from the cold air. They also appeared
to shiver, but they do this when excited. Any member who has kept
Caiques will agree they are not the sleekest of birds and they always
remind me of a tousled-haired urchin.
I am not one who subjects his pets to extremes of temperature
merely to prove a point. I am too fond of comfort myself for that, but
I do really think that we have tended in the past to fuss a little too
much. I appreciate of course that one Swallow does not make a
summer any more than one hardy pair of Caiques makes the genus as
a whole hardy, but my experience with this particular pair would
tend to show that they are hardier than was hitherto thought.
Since the summer of 1957 the Caiques have occupied an outdoor
aviary and have never been brought into winter quarters. Their
condition speaks for itself for seldom have I seen Caiques in such
robust condition, with powers of flight far and away superior to that
of birds which are only allowed out during the summer months.
The Caiques sleep in a small parrakeet nest-box about eighteen
inches, by nine inches, by nine inches in the open flight. One last
thought : although the Asiatic parrakeets here often lose their toes
from frostbite the Caiques have complete appendages.
Mr. Arthur A. Prestwich, in the excellent paper already referred to,
says on p. 164 " They (writing of the genus) are credited as being very
sensitive to cold, but once acclimatized they seem reasonably hardy.
They should, however, always be shut in their shelter at night and in
the winter artificial heat must be provided ".
Lady Poltimore, writing in the Magazine , November, 1936, about
the successful breeding of a hybrid Black-headed Caique X White-
breasted Caique says : "I put them in an aviary of which they were
the only occupants. This aviary is heated by hot-water pipes, and has
a garden flight which they use in warm weather, but they are always
shut into the inside portion at night, and in the winter. I have found
these birds very susceptible to cold, and during the time that they have
been breeding this summer, we have often had to give them artificial
heat."
Are my pair of Caiques an exception to the rule or is the species
hardier than we have been led to believe ? That is the question which
still needs a lot of inquiry.
I have one other Caique at the moment, a Pallid Caique (Pionites
melanocephala pallida) the survivor of four bought on the continent
a few years ago. As this bird is a family pet he has not been subjected
to life in an outdoor aviary. I believe he would prove equally hardy,
but it would be extremely cruel to deprive him of continuous human
company--he is never so happy as when he can nestle under one's
chin and be fondled.

Introduction
Aviculturists have repeatedly stressed the desirability of feeding
large quantities of a variety of live insects to insectivorous birds. The
frustrations which we encountered in attempting to raise and keep
perfect specimens of American Wood Warblers (Parulidae) for
ethological studies led us to explore various techniques of insect
culturing and capturing in an attempt to reach the ideal of an almost
pure diet of insects. The best of these techniques from almost all
standpoints is raising bee larvae (see Gary, Ficken, and Stein 1961).
However, other methods are also valuable. The purpose of this
paper is to discuss some of the methods currently used by entomologists
in culturing and capturing insects and, where possible, to tell of our
experiences in using these to feed insectivorous birds. There is also
a short discussion of some important facts concerning avian nutrition
including comments on food mixtures for insectivorous species.

Insect Culture Techniques
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945265428571429" page_id="56315636"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
Cultures can only be maintained if an adequate supply of adults
is available. This may be easily accomplished by merely continually
allowing a calculated number of the insects to reach maturity.
The following factors should be taken into consideration when
choosing an insect species to culture for birds : (1) potential pro-
ductivity and size of each species ; (2) ease of culture manipulation
and harvesting ; (3) controllability of production ; (4) danger of
disease in the culture ; (5) danger of the insects escaping into the
home or laboratory ; (6) cost of setting up the cultures and main-
taining them ; (7) efficacy of simply purchasing the insects from a
commercial establishment rather than raising them ; (8) danger of
overfeeding any one species to the birds ; and (9) palatability,
digestibility, and nutritive value of the insects.
From all of the above standpoints House Crickets ( Acheta domestica ),
Wax Moths ( Galleria mellonella ), House-flies ( Musca spp.), Blow-flies
(Calliphoridae), and Honey Bee larvae (Apis mellifica) seem most
suitable and the culture methods of all except the latter are discussed
in detail.
House Crickets (. Acheta domestica) have been raised in large numbers
by Dr. Robert L. Patton of the Department of Entomology, Cornell
University, using a method modified slightly from the one used by

Dr. F. E. Whitehead (Univ. Arkansas). P. C. Stone (Peterson,
1953) claims that they provide good food for birds and other
insectivorous animals.
A rearing container about 15 inches by 25 by 15 is a convenient
size. A glass aquarium, a wood or metal box, or an enamelled card-
board box will serve the purpose. The bottom may be covered with
dry sand, although this is not essential, but a finger bowl, cake pan,
or similar container filled with wet sand should be provided as a
repository for eggs. A single female may lay as many as 2,600 eggs
and these should begin to hatch in thirty days at 8o* F. or fifteen days
at 85* F. The rearing and breeding cage should be kept in a warm
room (8o* F. to 85* F.) or provided with a heat source such as a bank
of light bulbs. The large nymphs and adults are somewhat cannibalistic
so hiding places should be provided for the small nymphs. Excelsior
is the best material for this purpose. The young nymphs crawl into
the material and the older ones use it as a resting place.
Open formula chick starter mash is the most economical food for
crickets. This can be purchased from any poultry feed supply store.
Avoid the formulations which contain antibiotics if possible. Water
must be provided at all times. The easiest device for this consists of a
half-pint jar or a six to eight ounce water tumbler filled with water,
covered with a folded facial tissue, and finally covered with a round or
square piece of heavy-duty aluminium foil. This should be crimped
around the edges so that the tissue protrudes between the foil and the
glass. This can be inverted in the cage and the crickets can get enough
water to serve their needs by chewing the wet tissue. The tissue
must be changed regularly since the crickets have a strong tendency
to chew it off. Rearing can be done either in a series of separate
containers for the nymphs or in a combined rearing-breeding chamber.
The easiest way to harvest the crickets is to use a scoop-shaped
can made from a square gallon container. Cut one end at an angle
to form a scoop and replace the other end with one-quarter inch hard-
ware cloth. The crickets are gathered in the scoop and the individuals
that are too small for feeding will fall or be shaken through the hard-
ware cloth. The nymphs will reach the adult stage in from five to nine
weeks depending upon the rearing temperature.
Black Field Crickets may be raised also using a method described
by Swingle (1946) but these are much more chitinous than House
Crickets.
Wax Moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) are an ideal species to culture
for insectivorous birds. American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) have
been hand-raised and kept as adults using these insects almost exclu-
sively (Dr. Millicent Ficken, pers. comm.).
Dr. David Pimentel (pers. comm.) has developed two excellent
culture methods.

48 R. W. FICKEN AND W. C. DILGER-FOOD FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS
A medium is prepared as follows : Mix two pounds of " Pablum "
mixed baby food, 600 cc. glycerol, 600 cc. honey, one quart non-
fat milk, one quart brewer's yeast, and 1 per cent by weight of sodium
or calcium proprionate to inhibit mold.
The moths may be easily sexed by the length of their snouts (palpi) ;
the male has a blunt snout while the female has a long one.
The moths may be raised in half-pint jars as follows : (1) fill
the jars one-third full with medium ; (2) place two pairs of newly-
hatched adult moths in each jar and cover the jar with a cardboard
lid from an ice cream cup ; (3) place the jars in a plastic refrigerator
box and include one open jar half full of water. This may be removed
after the larvae have reached the second instar. When the larvae
begin to pupate each jar is emptied into the bottom of a plastic
refrigerator box or other similar container where they may be picked
from the medium and fed to the birds or frozen for later use.
The larvae may also be raised in much larger containers such as
ten-gallon tins in the following manner : (1) place 3 inches of medium
in the bottom ; (2) add fifty pairs of adults and cover the container
with a thin plastic sheet until the larvae reach the second instar ;
(3) place a 3 or 4 inch strip of corrugated cardboard around the inside
top edge of the container ; (4) when the larvae have begun to pupate
by crawling into the corrugations of the cardboard, remove the strip
and replace with a new one each day ; (5) add fresh medium as
needed ; (6) harvest the larvae by merely peeling the outer coating
off the cardboard. This technique should yield at least one hundred
larvae per day during the emigration to pupate. The cycle may be
continued indefinitely if the adult pairs are added each week.
Dr. Arthur A. Allen (pers. comm.) successfully raised Ruffed
Grouse ( Bonasa umbellus) on a diet that started with blow-fly larvae
(Calliphoridae), using a method which he developed and which we
have subsequently tried and found quite successful. A half of a beef
lung is left outside until dozens of blow-flies have deposited their eggs.
This lung is then placed in a shallow pan on a layer of charcoal to
absorb moisture. After two of three days the larvae are shaken from
the lung which is now dry and the lung is replaced by a slab of liver
on which to fatten them. The pan itself is put in a larger milk pan
containing a layer of bran so that the maggots, upon leaving the
piece of liver, crawl out of the moist pan and drop into the dry one
and cannot escape. After all the maggots have left the lung for at least
twenty-four hours the bran is sifted through a strainer so that it falls
through leaving the clean maggots and pupae. These are then ready
for immediate use or they can be put into small plastic bags and
frozen. The technique works well if several cautions are observed.
The culture must be kept dry either by housing in an open shed
or by building a shelter. The culture should be screened to keep out

predators such as dung beetles which feed upon the larvae. The amount
of eggs laid should be carefully controlled so as to obtain the optimum
number of larvae. When feeding the maggots to birds, care should be
exercised. Some birds pass them whole through the digestive tract,
for example, Eastern Bluebirds ( Sialia sialis) (James Hartshorne,
pers. comm.) and American Redstarts ( Setophaga ruticilla). Uncleaned
maggots, which have black undigested material in the gut, would
obviously be dangerous to feed. Larger and tougher birds may do
well on maggots. For example, a hybrid between an American Robin
(Turdus migratorius ) and a Blackbird ( Turdus merula) was raised from
the egg on a diet which consisted mainly of thawed blow-fly maggots
and earthworms (Dilger, 1959).
Dr. David Pimentel (pers. comm.) has developed highly successful
techniques for raising house-flies and blow-flies in quantity. Adult
flies are kept in plastic refrigerator boxes (twelve inches by ten inches
by four inches deep) which have been modified as follows : (1) a four
inch by six inch hole is cut in the top and a one inch wide hole is cut
along both of the 12 inch sides. These holes are covered with window
screen ; (2) a circular hole one inch in diameter is cut in the top and
corked. In order to obtain eggs place several 50 cc. wide-mouth vials
containing cheesecloth soaked in skim milk in with the adult flies.
This may be easily done by grasping each vial with long forceps and
lowering it through the one-inch hole. For blow-flies add a small piece
of liver to each vial as well.
Prepare the medium for the larvae as follows : (1) heat 2 * 7 liters
of water to boiling, then add 60 cc. agar powder and allow this to boil
for 20 minutes ; (2) in the meantime add 600 cc. dry skim milk and
600 cc. dry brewer's yeast powder to one liter of cold water. Mix
this thoroughly with a beater ; (3) add this mixture to the boiling
agar solution after turning off the flame and stir until the mixture
is uniform ; (4) ladle this into 4-ounce ice cream cups or comparable
containers until they are half full and store these in the refrigerator.
One batch should yield 30 medium cups.
More of the same type of plastic refrigerator boxes are used for
larval culture and are modified as follows : (1) a one inch layer of clean
sand is placed on the bottom ; (2) this in turn is covered by a platform
made of hardware cloth which rests just above the sand ; (3) a four inch
by six inch hole is cut in the top and covered with window screen.
Place about 200 house-fly eggs in each medium cup and cover
lightly or place about 100 to 150 blow-fly eggs in each medium cup
and do not cover. Each culture box should hold about nine such
medium cups.
When they are ready to pupate the fly larvae will crawl out of
the medium cups and fall into the dry sand. The larvae or pupae
(depending on how they are left) may be gathered daily by straining

the sand through a fine screen. Each plastic culture box should yield
about fifteen grams during the emigration and pupation stage.
Two species, Fruit Flies (.Drosophila spp.) and Mealworms (Tenebrio
spp.) have been used by many aviculturists and their value in biological
research has led to the development of very refined culture techniques
(e.g., Galtsoff etal ., 1959, and Peterson, 1953). It should be mentioned,
however, that Drosophila are undesirable for all except very small
birds because of their tiny size which makes their culture inefficient.
When feeding them to those small birds which have difficulty capturing
flying insects, it is best to use a vestigial wing mutant or arrange
the culture bottle with one tiny escape hole so that the birds may wait
there for them to walk out. Mealworms are perhaps used more than
any other insect by aviculturists but, as is well known, many birds
should be fed them very sparingly. Galtsoff et al. (loc. cit.) and
Peterson (loc. cit.) mention other insect species which also might be
useful to culture for birds, but none of them seems to possess as many
desirable qualities as those already considered.
Silk worm pupae, which are obtainable commercially, are a rather
expensive food but have been used by several aviculturists (e.g.,
Astley, 1907, and Neunzig, 1939). In the U.S., Promethea silkworm
pupae can be obtained commercially for about five cents each.

Entomologists have developed many methods of capturing insects
which can be fruitfully applied to aviculture.
Trapping is an excellent way of supplementing the insect diet of
birds since it yields a wide variety and involves a minimum amount
of work.
Night light traps of several types may be constructed to capture
insects (see Peterson, 1953, for details). Such traps may be connected
to a finely-screened cage so that the insects fall in and cannot escape.
The use of an electric fan blowing downward from above the light
increases the yield. The deleterious effects of light at night can be
minimized by covering the top of the cage with opaque material
and baffling the light at the opening or running a long, angled leader
to the cage through which they would fall. Filtered ultraviolet light
(black light) is very effective in bringing in insects but it is very
dangerous to look into such a light.
Mercury vapor lights placed in front of a large white sheet attract
many insects at night. These, of course, must be netted by hand and
kept until morning.
During the day, insects can be attracted in large numbers to rotting
fruit or meat hung in an outdoor flight and screened to prevent the
birds from eating it.

many noctuid moths by night and a few butterflies and other insects
by day. These may be captured by hand or the mixture may be
brushed on the inside of an outdoor flight so that the birds can capture
the insects (some moths will remain at the mixture until dawn while
others may seek refuge in the vegetation in the cage).
Sweep nets are available commercially or may be constructed (see
Peterson, 1953). These are best used in fields and by sweeping back
and forth large numbers of insects may be captured and dumped into
outdoor flights or into finely-screened indoor cages. The birds, of
course, will pick out what they like.
Outbreaks of caterpillars can sometimes be discovered which makes
practical the collecting of such species by hand. As is well known,
hairy and spiny species are rejected by most birds.
If an ant mound is discovered, ant pupae can be collected easily
using a method described by Bennett (1959). According to Naether
( 1 955) ant e gg s (pupae) are in themselves a complete food.
Earthworms ( Lumbricus terrestris ) make excellent food for certain
birds. These can be collected in huge quantities during the warmer
months, particularly after rains. James Hartshorne (pers. comm.)
has developed a very efficient technique by which he was able to
collect as many as 500 of these worms in an hour. A dull, miner's lamp
is worn on the head while a small bucket is hung around the neck.
By crawling along slowly on hands and knees over the low-lying
fairways of a golf course the number of worms captured on a good
night should only be limited by one's speed, dexterity, and endurance.
However , earthworms are extremely dangerous to use unless they are
free of gapeworms, coccidia, and insecticide residues.
Lumbricus terrestris can be cultured using the methods developed
for organic gardening (see Barrett, 1955) or biology (W. N. Ness in
Galtsoff, et al ., 1959). The latter reference also contains a method of
culturing the small white earthworm, Enchytraeus albidus , which he
claims is an excellent food for small fish and amphibia.
Lumbricus terrestris may be kept alive several days by refrigerating
them at about 40* F. We froze large numbers of them in little packets
for use in the winter, the only drawback being that they become
slightly mushy on thawing. Before freezing earthworms examine each
individual to make sure it is alive.
" Meating Off "
When a bird is brought in from the wild, there is often a problem in
getting it to eat dry mix if it is exclusively insectivorous. This process
is termed " meating off" or " breaking off". This may be attempted
in several ways. Conway (1957) states : "The normal behavior of
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.994094840909091" page_id="56315642"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
52 R. W. FICKEN AND W. C. DILGER-FOOD FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS
some problem feeders may be utilized to change their habits. An
example is certain warblers which will not feed readily when newly
captured, but which will drink. The trick is to keep them warm and
dry and gradually to add insectile food to their drinking water. In
a little while the warbler is drinking a soup, then a mash, and finally
eating our normal moist insectivorous mixture." He goes on to
describe other methods used with woodpeckers and kingfishers.
Another method is used more widely. The insect larvae are merely
placed on the insectivorous mix and the birds inadvertently eat some
of the mix in eating the insect. The number of insects put on the
mix is slowly reduced as the birds learn to eat the mix. This process
might be accelerated by putting a small dab of honey or nectar paste
on each insect so that some of the mix adheres to it.
" Meating off" should be done with extreme caution. The birds
should be watched carefully during the process to determine whether
they are eating the mix. More sensitive species should not be pushed
too fast, and may die if forced. One reason for this is that the change
in diet is too abrupt and they cannot make a rapid enough physiological
adjustment. Perhaps the best way is to give the birds a good meal of
pure insects in the morning and evening and do the " meating off"
in between. Some birds can never be trained to eat a dry mix.
Generally speaking, even though softbills eat a mix, they should be
given as many insects as possible throughout the year and particularly
during the molting and breeding seasons.
Automatic Feeding of Live Insects
The problem of leaving birds which will eat only moving insects
may be solved in several ways. Various baits (see above) will always
attract some. A day's supply of wax moth larvae can be left in a dish
of water where they will float and remain alive for at least eight
hours. This method could also be tried with other insects. Cultures
or live pupae may be left in containers from which the larvae or
hatched adults can escape one at a time and be captured by the birds.
Certain non-flying insects (e.g., crickets) can be left in straight-walled
glazed dishes. The problem may be completely solved by releasing
large numbers of any desirable insect species in a cage from which
they cannot escape or crawl under things.
If the birds will eat insects which are not moving, they may be
left with a large supply of pupae, or in cold weather with sluggish
live adults and larvae. Frozen insects can also be used in this case
but should not be left more than a day in warm weather or six hours
in hot weather.
Another widely used method of obtaining insects for birds is simply
cutting a hole in the cage to release the pair after the first egg (or all)

is laid and letting them forage in the wild (Ivor, 1943). However,
it is best to give the birds an easy way of finding the hole again once
they are out. By painting around the hole and by placing a perch
so that it projects both in and out of the cage below the hole, the
chances of the birds returning without difficulty may be greatly
increased.
Food Mixtures and some Nutritional Considerations
It is quite possible to develop an inexpensive food mixture which
is adequate for a single species. We have kept several species of
thrushes in perfect condition on a mixture developed by Dilger (1959).
However, this mixture was completely rejected by several parulids
as well as Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). It consists of one-third
" Big Red " dog meal, one-third dried " flies " (actually aquatic bugs
and other invertebrates), and one-third turkey starter mash. Starter
mashes, in addition to turkey, have been developed for chicks, quail,
pheasants, and ducks and any of these might be used in such a mix.
The three components are mixed with cottonseed oil until slightly
moist which greatly increases palatability as well as being an additional
source of vitamins and fatty acids. The cottonseed oil should not remain
in the food more than a few days. The reason for this is that the
unsaturated fatty acids cause slow oxidation of vitamin E and to a
lesser extent vitamin A. Cod liver oil is much worse in this respect
(Scott and Norris, 1959, and Scott, pers. comm.). This oxidizing
quality may be essentially eliminated by adding an antioxidant such
as " Santoquin " which is used in chicken mash (o-oi per cent).
Then, of course, the mix may be stored with the oil in it.
Self-choice experiments have been useful in helping to determine the
relative number of various dietary components needed by chickens.
Each bird is given a choice of a variety of foods and the amount of
each eaten per day is measured. However, only by averaging the
amount of each material taken by a large number of individuals
was this method useful in formulating an adequate diet. Certain
birds may take up to ten times more or ten times less than the average.
These individuals were not healthy (Scott, pers. comm.). In self-choice
diets for cage-birds similar experiments can be performed. These
might include a wide variety of different seeds for finches or for
insectivorous birds, a selection of several insect species or several
commonly used wet or dry foods or an array of various insectivorous
mixtures.
If mixes are kept in a cool, dry place the nutrients do not deteriorate
and molding is rare. However, as soon as any excess moisture is
added to a mix it will begin to decay and mold. If the mold happens
to be Aspergillum spp , there is a great danger of the birds exposed to it
</bodyText>

54 R. W. FICKEN AND W. C. DILGER-FOOD FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS
developing aspergillosus which is a deadly infection (Chute, 1959).
Aspergillum will also grow well in wet, dirty cages. If a dry mix is
developed and if it is not allowed to get any excess moisture in it,
it may be left in a cage for several days. However, after this time a
fresh supply should be given simply because it is actually a self-choice
diet and the birds have, hopefully, picked out what is best for them.
To maximize self-choice the mix should be fed in a flat, shallow
container.
On the subject of vitamins the findings of nutritionists discussed
by Scott and Norris (1959) will be considered. Ordinarily vitamin
supplements are not necessary if the animal is fed a diet which has
been scientifically determined to be perfect but, since these are avail-
able for so few birds, it is best to give birds some extra vitamins.
We have supplied " Zymadrops " because they contain vitamin D 3
which is the most active form of vitamin D for the chicken. The
recommended dosage has not been determined for many birds.
However, since vitamins are expensive and since giving great over-
dosages may be harmful, it may be possible to arrive at a rule of thumb
for dosage level based on their review of vitamins in poultry nutrition.
This rule of thumb is based on some extremely crude assumptions :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.79575" page_id="56315644"  page_num="54" year="" vol="">
(1) All birds need about the same amount of vitamins as a young

chicken ; (2) all birds eat the same amount of mix per day in propor-
tion to their body weight as a chicken ; (3) the vitamin which is in
least supply in "Zymadrops" relative to the needs of the chicken should
be used as an index even though the relative amounts of the other
vitamins given will then exceed that needed by the chicken ; (4) the
bird obtains no vitamins from its diet. Based on these assumptions
2 cc. of " Zymadrops " vitamins should be added to each pound of
food mixture. If insects are fed and the bird is the size of a canary
put two drops per day on an insect fed to it. We have found that
it is very inefficient to add vitamins to the drinking water since it must
be changed frequently and most of it is wasted. With birds that eat
only seeds, however, this is the best method available. Seeds which
have been soaked in vitamins retain these on their coats, but these
are husked by many bird species and the vitamins are not ingested
(Dr. Claude Bice, pers. comm.). Scott and Norris (1959) also point out
an interesting fact about raw fish and the heart and spleen of warm-
blooded animals. These contain thiaminase which destroys thiamin
(vitamin Bj). Dr. Robert Goodwin (pers. comm.) found that Black
Terns (Chlidonias niger) fed on raw fish developed symptoms of severe
thiamin deficiency.
Norris and Scott (1959) bring out some other facts of general interest
about dietary components. Dry powdered milk may be a useful
addition to the diet in a low percentage but other carbohydrate
sources should be supplied because at least some birds cannot digest

lactose. Torula yeast is very low in selenium and should not be used
as a sole protein source. Scott (pers. comm.) considers brewer's yeast
to be better for several reasons and this is not low in selenium. He
also performed some interesting experiments with sterilized ground
chicken feathers as a component (5 per cent) of pheasant mash.
Ring-necked Pheasants in a crowded pen which were fed this mash
did not pick while the controls did. The addition of ground feathers
seems to fill some dietary needs of the pheasants and the addition of
5 per cent to insectivorous mixtures could possibly be useful.

By Captain R. S. de Q. Quincey (Hereford, England)
Shortly before Sqn.-Ldr. Everitt left to take up his appointment with
Mr. Boehm in the United States, he told me that he had two pairs of
small Babblers that he thought I might like to have. One of these
pairs he informed me is called the Rufus or Red-fronted Babbler,
a small, striated, olivaceous bird with a rufus frontlet, of which
one or two further examples have arrived--and the other, unnamed
pair have now been identified by Mr. John Yealland as the Rufus-
bellied Babbler (Dumetia hyperythra). These little birds are darkish
olivaceous brown above, and cinnamon rufus below, very slightly
brighter on top of the head, and a distinctive feature is a somewhat
fan-shaped tail, the central tail-feathers being the longer. They
carry their tails straight out, and not upright like a Wren or Tailor-
bird, and sometimes when hopping about they wag the tail from side
to side. A photograph of one of the adult birds (I really can't tell
which, but probably the cock) on a stone at the edge of the stream in
their aviary was taken by David Attenborough last summer. It
shows the general appearance of this little bird rather better than any
description of mine could portray it.
The birds duly arrived and were wintered in an indoor aviary. They
were always together, and I concluded they were a true pair, although
to me they appeared to be identical. In the spring (i960) I turned
them out into a very densely-planted aviary, where they had as
companions a pair of Red-flanked Zosterops, a pair of Red-flanked
Bush Robins, a pair of small Tanagers, and one Violet-eared Humming
Bird. In the early summer they built a dome-shaped nest, laid,
and hatched out two young ones, which died at about five days old
and were thrown out of the nest. They appeared to be quiet for a
little while, and then I discovered they had built three more nests,
possibly to deceive inquisitive searchers ! They were all dome-shaped,
almost Wren-like nests. One was built about 4 inches above the ground
in a tall tussock of grass, and the other two were in a small planting of
Lonicera nitida about 2 or 3 feet above the ground. They laid in one
of these nests, but apparently only one young was hatched on this
occasion. However, this left the nest sometime early in July. At
this time we were destroying wasps' nests, so plenty of wasp-grubs
and live ant eggs (also plentiful just then) were available. Within
three weeks of leaving the nest it was virtually impossible to tell the
young one from its parents. At about this moment the hen built
again and laid three eggs, which I should say are approximately
the size of a Wren's egg, blotched and spotted more at the thick end

with dullish red-brown markings on a greyish all-over ground colour,
something like the markings on a Robin's egg, but the whole effect
a somewhat more blue in tone. It is a little difficult to be certain of the
period of incubation, but I would say it was about thirteen days. Two
young ones were hatched, but these disappeared completely within
two days--possibly mice--which I hope to exclude once and for all
when these aviaries are rebuilt this or next year. I should think the
young bird that was reared to maturity was in the nest about eighteen
days, but these small birds are very secretive, and it is a little difficult
to intrude too much on their privacy without upsetting things. When
the hen went to nest again the cock bird continued to guard or keep
near the youngster, when he was not taking his turn at incubating. This
young bird is now completely independent, and seems to be in robust
health despite an appallingly wet late summer. When I wrote and told
Sqn. Ldr. Everitt of this breeding he was quite sure it was a " first."
Apart from Shamas, which seem to breed every year here, the only
other birds that have done anything in i960 are a pair of Golden
Tanagers, which hatched two young, and which " something "
removed from the nest when about eight days old. They were in a
somewhat crowded aviary. The Brazilian Wood Nymph (Thalurania
glaucopis) hen has tried to build twice, but has been so persecuted by
the cock bird that, on both occasions, she seems to have given up
hope. I hope she will not try again until next year. Rufus-bellied
Niltavas built (in a nest-box), the hen laid three eggs, and was then
picked up dead, although looking in perfect form. I put two of her
eggs into a Spotted Flycatcher's nest, but this was destroyed by cats
two or three days later. Red-flanked Bush Robins built (in a nest-
box), but later the nest was destroyed, and we found one egg had
a dead chick in it. Daurian Redstarts also built in a nest-box but the
hen was found dead on her three eggs--all really rather unsatisfactory.
Loo Choo Robins nested in December, 1959. The hen was sitting
on four eggs, in a nest-box in an outside flight, while snow was on
the ground. She even spent Christmas Day on her nest ! I took the
cock away as he started moulting, and she gave up her nest after
sitting for about four weeks ! Then she went into a moult. When I put
them together again in the spring she appeared quite friendly, and
then suddenly hurled herself on the cock bird, whom she blinded
or knocked about so much that he became blind, and had to be
destroyed. She moulted again recently, and a new cock bird has also
just come through his moult. I do not think I shall put them together
before next spring, if they both survive the winter.
As described above, Captain R. S. de Q. Quincey has bred the
Rufus-bellied Babbler (Dumetia hyperythra). It is believed that this
may be a first success.

By D. L. McKenzie (Winchelsea, Sussex, England)
Mutations of the Masked Lovebird are still rare in this country.
On the Continent, blues, yellows, and whites are fairly common but
are generally of Japanese origin and are not particularly hardy. Blues
that I have imported have not lasted many months and have not been
really strong enough to risk outdoors. Yellows and whites are very
poorly coloured, the yellow being heavily suffused with green and the
whites with blue.
Two years ago I was fortunate enough to procure a British-bred
blue hen and two green-blue cocks. Last year from one of these cocks
and the blue hen I had five young--four blues and one green-blue.
Early this year I was offered a yellow cock, one of an imported pair,
the hen having died. As the cock was well acclimatized I purchased
it and have mated it to the green-blue hen bred the previous year.
Erom three rounds (the first farmed out to foster-parents) I have
bred eight young--three yellows, three blues, and two greens (pre-
sumably split for yellow and possibly for blue and white as well).
The young yellows are a better colour than their parent but still very
variegated.
These British-bred mutations are equally as hardy as normal
greens. The blues can be distinguished on hatching by the colour of
the down, which is pink instead of the normal orange. The beak is
orange in colour until several weeks after leaving the nest, when it
changes to a pale pinkish-bone colour. The young yellows have the
normal orange down on hatching and cannot be determined until
they start to feather.
The flight feathers of the yellows are white, the remaining wing-
feathers being heavily suffused with pale green. The body colour is
mainly yellow, turning to green on the abdomen. The back is yellow
from the nape of the neck, turning to green on the rump. The mask
is brown instead of the normal black, and the beak is red.
The blue body-colour of these British-bred birds is much deeper
than the rather pale colour of the Continental birds and two of my
first-year cocks are really deep in colour.
I have constructed six new flights, 6 feet by 3 feet by 6 feet high

for more intensive breeding next season. These flights are half wire
and half boarded. I find this an ideal compartment for one pair to
breed in and leave them with their nest-boxes all winter. Lovebirds
generally I find to be late breeders, first broods appearing in late
June and early July, so that they are still rearing young in October.
This suits them quite well with the usual mild autumns we have in
the south and I am fortunate in that my aviaries are in a very sheltered
garden and all face south.
Young birds definitely need more shelter and even their flights
should be well protected. They need a good draughtproof shed into
which they should be driven at night. They seem very susceptible
to cold and wet in their first winter.
I feed mainly canary seed with a little Indian millet but they eat
very little of the latter. Whole oats and striped sunflower I throw
on to the floor of the earthed flights and I feed as much groundsel
and chickweed as I can find. On this diet they keep particularly
healthy, but in some nests the young are badly feathered and often
leave the nest in a semi-naked condition, not completely feathering
for a further week or two. This is obviously due to bad feeding by
the parents and may be due also to their not being in perfect condition
themselves. Feather-plucking, mainly at the back of the neck is
another annoying fault with hens, but the young invariably feather
perfectly shortly after leaving the nest.
I have had French moult in one nest this year but fortunately not
amongst the blues. This is not uncommon, I believe, with lovebirds
and the young are best destroyed.
Next season I intend to limit my breeding activities to the Masked
mutations, keeping only the best breeding pairs from my other birds
as foster-parents.
Although a clutch is usually five eggs, they seldom rear more than
three, and two is more normal. It is a pity to waste these other eggs
and there is no difficulty in fostering out to other breeding pairs soon
after hatching, leaving each pair with two young to rear. If all the
first-round eggs are removed soon after the clutch is laid they quickly
go to nest again. The first eggs can be farmed out to normal birds
already sitting and an extra round is thereby obtained without the
mutation pair being unduly taxed.
The big problem now is the introduction of fresh blood. With
very few blues in the country and the Continental birds being so
unreliable this is not going to be easy.
Mr. E. N. T. Vane is of the opinion that Continental mutations of
Japanese origin are of mixed Masked and Black-cheeked Lovebird
stock. The brown mask of my yellows might indicate this. I have
noticed that all young green birds bred from the original yellow cock
show a reddish brown tinge to the mask especially on the forehead

By Viscount Chilston (Maidstone, Kent, England)
It may seem paradoxical that in a year of much arduous but
successful rearing the one breeding result which has given me more
pleasure than any other was the one which was achieved without my
aid at all--in fact even without the aid of the infant's own kind. The
latter fact was what seemed to me to be of interest and perhaps to
help to explain the comparative ease with which feral colonies of
Mandarin Duck have from time to time become established in this
country.
I had kept a couple of pairs of Mandarin for several years without
their having ever--to my knowledge--bred. This year (i960) seemed
no exception, until one day at the very beginning of May--during
an exceptionally cold and wet spell of weather--I saw, darting nimbly
over the surface of my lake--what I instantly recognized to be a baby
Mandarin. I have bred many Carolinas, and they were breeding this
year, but there was no mistaking the yellower colour, the large eye
with its pronounced streak, the longer legs, and the more " aristocratic "
head and bearing--in fact the altogether more intelligent and self-
sufficient air which distinguishes the Mandarin from " lesser breeds ".
For, though it is evident that a Mandarin egg must have been laid
in one of the several Carolina nest-boxes placed on the island in the
lake, the duckling's connection with the pair of Carolinas, who in
the first few days appeared to feel some responsibility for it, was
of the loosest possible description. Unlike most other ducklings,
it seemed neither to need nor to wish for their protection. Indeed, so
independent was this little creature that within a few days of hatching
it was coming up on to the land with the other waterfowl at feeding time
and--to my horror--eagerly picking up and swallowing hard corn.
It knew no fear--either towards myself or the other birds--despite
the fact that it was continually being pounced upon by a vicious
Magellan Goose, who once even caught it and threw it about a yard
into the air.
Partly through its own indefatigability at catching flies on the
water and partly through the aid of poultry pellets (which I tried to
put in its way rather than corn), it grew rapidly and strongly. Every
feeding time, if it was not already there waiting nonchalantly among

the adult ducks and geese, there was a moment's apprehension--and
then suddenly it would appear as from nowhere, sleek and spry as
ever. I never made any attempt to lay hands on this charming little
creature for fear of destroying its confidence ; so it was never pinioned,
and though, when it began to fledge I debated whether to feather-clip
it, I never did so, deciding to hope it would stay of its own accord.
Instead, as soon as its sex (a male) was clear, I got it a young mate
to try to tie it by invisible bonds.
However, though now a magnificent specimen in full nuptial
plumage, he pays no attention whatever to this one or to either of
the other females of his own species, but prefers to consort with some
Garolinas kept on a stream in another part of the grounds, whither
he flies daily--swift, silent, and agile as a Woodcock, as he flits through
the trees--after feeding with the other birds beside the large lake.
Only in this choice of company is the influence of his foster-parentage
perhaps discernible.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, England)
We have, since 1957, received great co-operation from the New
Zealand Government in our effort to acquire a comprehensive collec-
tion of waterfowl that are indigenous to the Dominion. In that year
four species were caught and sent by polar air route to us at Slimbridge.
These were the New Zealand Grey Duck (. Anas superciliosa superciliosa ),
New Zealand Scaup (. Aythya novae-seelandiae) , New Zealand Brown
Duck (Anas aucklandica chlorotis), and Blue or Mountain Duck
(Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos ).
Early in i960 we heard that the Department of Internal Affairs
had hatched and reared some Shoveler and in June two pairs of these
interesting birds duly arrived. They settled down well after the
rigours of quarantine and it is hoped that in due course they will breed.
A further two male specimens of the exciting Blue or Mountain Duck
also arrived and it is hoped to dispatch us some females of the species
in the coming year
Having regard to the generosity and trouble taken by the New
Zealand authorities on our behalf, we are pleased to report that three
of these ducks have now been bred here : the Grey Duck, the Scaup,
and now in i960 the Brown Duck. Two pairs of Brown Duck that came
in 1957 have never become very tame and spend a great deal of the
daylight hours hiding in the grass and rushes of their enclosure. One
pair shared a pen with a pair of Cereopsis Geese but neither showed any
interest in the other. Nesting sites were provided in the shape of
boxes at ground level, cover fabricated from willow wands, and cider

S. T. JOHNSTONE-NOTES FROM THE WILDFOWL TRUST
barrels raised some two feet from the ground. All these were used a great
deal as refuges from the public gaze and it was this habit that accounted
for the failure to find the nest before the duck commenced incubation.
It was thought that the missing duck was merely hiding in the cider
barrel but she moved and was seen to be covering some eggs. It was
decided to leave her to her own devices and she was undisturbed for
three weeks. On going to the barrel after this interval four large
creamish-buff eggs were found deserted, two of which were addled
and two infertile. These averaged 52 g. in weight and measured
57 mm. by 42 mm. A point of interest was that there were no broken
shells in the nest and a complete absence of down. Although the
Dendrocygna pull no down and the swans very little one would not have
expected this to be characteristic of Anas aucklandica chlorotis. During
this investigation both birds were invisible in the undergrowth and
we assumed that we would have to wait for another year for successful
breeding. Two days later, to our immense pleasure and surprise, the
duck appeared on her pond with three dark brown ducklings. Both
parents and babies were caught up and put into the Guinness Aviary in
order to keep them free from the attentions of the Cereopsis and vermin.
The food offered consisted of ants' eggs, biscuit, and turkey starter
crumbs ; a small amount of the last disappeared overnight but from
the state of the turf in the aviary it was apparent that a great deal of
nocturnal worming was taking place.
Examination of a duckling showed there to be little contrasting
downy pattern and save for four light spots on the back and a small
area of the belly, the overall appearance is of dark mahogany. The
bill is large and slate-blue in colour and the tarsus is grey. It is suggested
that the ducklings should resemble those of the Chestnut-breasted
Teal, but my impression is that they are quite different from any other
ducklings we have reared at Slimbridge. Hatched about the
17th September the young appeared to be fully grown by the middle
of November.
Apart from the Brown Ducks, some 1,200 birds of ninety different
kinds were reared in our collections but we had our disappointments.
The Trumpeter Swans laid five eggs, three of which were fertile,
but the pen failed to bring off any cygnets. The only Pink-footed
Goose to lay hybridized with a Greater Snow Goose. Three Hooded
Merganser ducklings hatched but failed to survive more than three
days. The use of some straw in the nesting-boxes that proved to have
a heavy infection of Aspergillus funiigatus accounted for the deaths of
Ross and Emperor goslings, a whole brood of Barrow's Goldeneye,
and five young Smew.
On the credit side the Magpie Geese reared four young, the Bewick's
Swan four, and the Black-necked Swan five cygnets. In the aviary

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
With a few exceptions such as Western Bluebirds, African Grey
Parrots, and blue Ringnecks, the 1960 breeding season here at Keston
was one of the most disappointing we have ever had. This may have
been partly due to the abnormal weather which, although it was so
sunny in May and early June that it seemed we might be going to have
a repetition of the lovely summer of 1959, was thereafter literally a
complete washout, with frequent thunderstorms, torrential rain, and
no spells of settled weather at all.
The following parrakeets were bred : blue Ringnecks, lutino
Ringnecks, Layard's, Golden-mantled Rosellas, Stanleys, yellow Red-
rumps, Splendid Grass Parrakeets, Turquoisines, and Bourkes. Also
Cockatiel, Fischer's, Masked, and Peach-faced Lovebirds, and many
thousands of Budgerigars in all the various colour varieties.
Others, which hatched young but failed to rear them were : Pileated
Parrakeet, Princess of Wales's, Plum-headed, and our male lutino
Plum-headed mated to a normal-coloured hen.
A pair of African Grey Parrots reared three fine young ones, and a
pair of Blue-fronted Amazons two ; while a pair of Cuban Amazons
and a male Festive mated to a female Red-throated Amazon (both of
which pairs had bred successfully in previous years) hatched young
which died in the nest when about half-grown. A pair of Red-sided
Eclectus again had clear eggs.
Mountain Bluebirds and Amethyst Starlings went to nest but failed
to rear any young, but Western Bluebirds did very well, one pair
rearing seven young and another pair six. There were, however,
several losses after the young were fledged which may have been caused
either through injury to the skull or from vertigo--the symptoms of

both being much the same. All the young ones were excellent speci-
mens, but were terribly wild, battering about if anyone went near
their aviaries. Next year (1961) we are going to have the top of the
flights entirely boarded over, as most of the damage is, of course, done
when they bang their heads against the wire roof of the flight. A cock
Mountain Bluebird mated to a hen Western reared one young one--
a female.
A pair of Australian Crimson Finches went to nest with all the zeal
of Zebra Finches, rearing one in their first nest and two in their second.
By then it was late in the year and their nest-box was removed, but they
continued to carry nesting material until well into the winter.
In 1959 we received among a consignment of Common African
Fire-Finches a male which was rusty-orange in colour instead of red,
and a female which was equally distinct, the beak in both cases being
orange instead of red. The pair spent the winter in an aviary to
themselves and went to nest in the spring rearing two in their first
brood and four in the second, all of which take after their parents in
colour. On their arrival we sent a description of them to
Mr. Macdonald of the British Museum and he replied that he did
not know of them at all and that they had no similar skins at the
Museum. He thought they were probably a colour mutation, but that
as we had received a pair and not, as is much more usual, just a single
specimen, there might be a small colony of these unusually coloured
Fire-Finches established and breeding apart from the others.
That this may be so, or that they may even be a hitherto unrecorded
local race, has been rather interestingly borne out by the behaviour
of ours. All six young ones, which have turned out to be five cocks and
one hen, are in an aviary together with two normal-coloured hens.
Yet, although all the orange cocks are interested in the orange hen,
they ignore the two normal hens completely. In any case I mentioned
in a letter to Mr. Macdonald that as the place where a new colour
variety of a bird was first propagated is so soon forgotten, it might
be desirable to incorporate Keston in their name, and he replied that
he thought they might suitably be called the Keston Fire-Finch ; so,
adding a word to denote their colour, we propose to call them the
Keston Orange Fire-Finch.
Two hen orange Roller Canaries mated to a cock Hooded Siskin
went to nest and hatched young which were thrown out of the nest
soon after they hatched, and as we felt that the Siskin was in some way
responsible for this, we removed him when they had gone to nest again.
One hen, however, got egg-bound and the eggs she had already laid
were put with the three the other hen had just started to incubate, and
she eventually hatched two young ones which she reared single-
handed. When first fledged they were little brown Linnet-like birds
with no trace of red or orange, but by now (December) they take very

much after their father in appearance, except that their body colour
is orangey-copper instead of the flame-red of a Hooded Siskin. Rather
unusual is that, whereas most hybrids are about intermediate in size
between their two parents, these two are much the same size as a Roller
Canary, which, of course, is a considerably larger bird than a Hooded
Siskin.
A supposed pair of Azure-winged Magpies ( Cyanopica cooki)
nested in a privet bush in our large pond aviary, but shortly after
incubation had started, the smaller of the two was found scalped, and
as all the eggs were clear the birds were probably both hens, the
larger of which had turned upon and killed its companion.
The breeding here this season for the first time in captivity of the
Pretty Warbling Finch ( Poospiza ornata ) has already been fully recorded
in the Magazine by Mr. Cummings, and a pair of Ringed Warbling
Finches ( Poospiza torquata) also went to nest, but failed to rear any
young, probably because their nest was built close to the ground, and
while sitting they were disturbed by mice.
In the spring we received several pairs each of two rarely-imported
Waxbills, namely the Black-bellied Fire-Finch ( Lagonosticta rara), and
the Black-crowned Waxbill (Estrilda nonnula) . The Black-bellied Fire-
Finch is very handsome, being a rich claret-colour with the breast and
abdomen black ; while the Black-crowned is to my mind one of the
prettiest of the Waxbills, having a sooty black cap and tail and dark
slate-grey back and wings. The under parts are chalky-white faintly
tinged with grey, and a narrow line along the side of the body, just
below the wings, is bright crimson, as are the rump and flanks. The
upper mandible is red and the lower one blackish. We have retained
two pairs of each species and hope to have a shot at breeding them next
season. Last year's liberty pair of Australian Crested Bronze-winged
Pigeons wintered successfully in the garden and went to nest in the
same tree rearing four young ones in two broods. The hen, however,
was not seen again after the second two fledged, so must either have
died or been killed, as it is most unlikely that she would have strayed.
We tried Barbary Doves at liberty and possibly because they had been
kept in an aviary instead of a cage before being let loose, they quite
belied their reputation of being " stupid birds at liberty ", as they flew
quite strongly and roosted in sensible places well protected from owls.
They are difficult birds to sex but I think we had three cocks and a
hen, and the latter went to nest, but disappeared while sitting. Never-
theless, we caught up the remaining three in the autumn and having
since obtained three more shall hope to let out six next year. They
are tame and charming and their pale colouring makes them
very conspicuous and decorative at liberty--added to which, of course,
is the delightfully soothing sound of their coo--the nicest perhaps of
that of all doves.

66 E. J. BOOSEY-BREEDING RESULTS AT KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM
The wild Turtle Doves, which normally are so nervous as to be quite
unapproachable, gained confidence through coming to feed with our
Barbary Doves and Crested Pigeons, and it was a rare pleasure to be
able to get close enough to them to appreciate what truly beautiful
little doves they are.
A particularly sad loss was that of three specimens of the rare and
beautiful Jardine's Parrot. We started the season with two pairs of
these birds which we had had for over a year, so there seemed every hope
of breeding from them. Then one night a thief gained access to our
terrace aviaries, and finding the doors of the flights padlocked, con-
tented himself with opening many of the shelter feeding doors. Actually
few birds escaped, but among them had to be the best pair of Jardine's
Parrots, and as the hen of the other pair died suddenly about a week
later, we decided to part with the remaining cock, as there seemed
little hope of being able to obtain a mate for him.
The hen of our pair of Peruvian Green Jays (Xanthura yncas) died
towards the end of the summer, but the accompanying photograph of
them was taken by Alec Brooksbank the previous year. When first
received from an aviculturist in Cornwall, their plumage had already
undergone the same colour change in captivity as takes place in the
case of the Hunting Cissa--that is to say the green areas had gone blue
and the yellow ones white. It may, therefore, be of interest to record
that by the end of the two years we had them at Keston, the blue of
the upper surface had become suffused with green, and the white
of the under parts with yellow. This may have been due to a combina-
tion of three factors : they were the sole occupants of a roomy planted
outdoor aviary where in summer they were able to capture for them-
selves a considerable quantity of live insects, etc ; their home-made
insectivorous mixture contained soya flour and raw grated carrot ;
and during the moult they were kept constantly supplied with elder-
berries--the elder being one of the comparatively few things that really
revel in our very chalky soil, which is so deadly to many of my own
favourites, such as rhododendrons and azaleas.
Another loss was that of our best pair of lutino Ringnecks--plus
their three young ones. The latter were dead in the nest by the time
their mother's body was discovered, and just to round things off, the
cock also died a few weeks later.
A further casualty was the last of our Brown's Parrakeets--a rather
elderly male who at one time nearly murdered his Brown's wife, but had
produced a brood of hybrids when mated to a hen Golden-mantled
Rosella.

BREEDING OF THE SMOOTH-BILLED ANI
(Crotophaga ani )
By A. H. Isenberg (Portola Valley, California, U.S.A.)
Four years ago I received, from Holland, five Smooth-billed Anis ;

it was the first time I had ever seen these birds offered. All arrived in
good shape but rather thin. After three weeks in a holding aviary
they were fit to release into one of our largest aviaries, approximately
50 by 40 feet and 9 to 15 feet high, plus a large unheated shelter.
In 1958, a nest was built in the shelter among dry branches on top
of a " holding aviary The young hatched but none was reared.
In 1959, several young hatched but only one was raised by hand and
is now a most affectionate, tame bird. It is not tolerated by the others,
so is kept in one of the " holding aviaries ", where it is menacingly
visited by the adult Anis.
This year (i960) the Anis had killed one of the original five and
then nested about 10 feet off the ground in an alder tree, which is
quite dense from many prunings. The nest is quite large and made of
leaves, twigs, and grass. The eggs were greenish-blue with a chalky
white coating. All four adults seemed to incubate and guard the nest
and, when the young hatched, all four helped in feeding.
This year when the young left the nest I did not take them, as the
weather was quite warm for all of July. One young was reared from
the first nest and one was thrown out. We tried to rear this one by
hand, but after several weeks, it succumbed. The other matured well.
Four young were raised from the second nest in July and, again we
had fine weather. After the five young were well on their way, the
adults killed two of the four adults before we could separate them.
This action was rather baffling as Anis are so gregarious in the wild.
I did notice that one of the four adults did not keep up with its duties
of feeding the young, but the others did.
It was most amusing to toss a mealworm into the air and watch
these grotesque and rather clumsy-billed birds very adroitly catch the
worms and rush off to feed the young. They never carried more than
one mealworm at a time, so it can be imagined how many trips the
parents made to feed their raucous young. The mealworms were
always carried by the head and disappeared down the young like
lightning. Pieces of horse-heart and much ground meat was fed.
The ground meat I sometimes mixed with yellow corn-meal, wheat-
germ, and pablum. Anis catch a lot of small insects on the lawn.
These birds are very quick in their actions.
The flock of seven Anis is fun to watch, trying to outdo each other
when mealworm time arrives. Anis are great sun worshippers and
continuously stretch out in the sun. I have watched Groove-bills in

Arrivals of especial interest during the months of January and
February number twenty-five. A second Christmas Island Frigate
Bird ( Fregata andrewsi) was brought from the Cocos Islands by Capt.
D. Scorgie : it appears to be a season older than the first and of the
opposite sex--evidently a female, for it is larger.
Other presentations include a Fulvous Whistling Duck sent from
Uganda by Mrs. E. Wright, a Whooper Swan from Mr. Tom Spence,
two Hawaiian Geese from the Wildfowl Trust, a Baikal Teal from
Dr. K. C. Searle, two Nutmeg Fruit Pigeons, two Green Imperial
Pigeons and a White-fronted Bronze-wing (. Henicophaps albifrons ) from
Mr. A. A. Prestwich, a Chestnut-bellied Nuthatch from Messrs. G. H.
and J. R. Newmark and a Military Starling ( Pezites m. militaris) from
Mrs. A. Fowler.
Two Oyster-catchers and four Dunlins, a Malachite and a Wedge-
tailed Sunbird, a pair of Fairy Bluebirds {Irena puella turcosa) and two
Rothschild's Grackles (. Leucopsar rothschildi) have also been received.
The Hawaiian Goose was first exhibited in Regent's Park in 1832
and bred here in subsequent years. This bird bred freely in European
collections, but for some reason became scarce soon after about 1900
and the last specimen, a gander forty-two years old, vanished from
Cleres at the time of the invasion in 1940. From three specimens
received by the Wildfowl Trust in 1950-51, more than 100 have been
bred at Slimbridge and at Leckford--almost half the world's total
population and the classic example of how aviculture can, in certain
cases, assist in the preservation of birds.

the Murchison Falls and the Queen Elizabeth Park in Uganda ; from
thence back to Nakuru in Kenya to film the flamingos. The second
part of the safari took them from Nakuru to the N'gorongoro Crater,
Amboseli, Tsavo National Park, and finally back to the Nairobi
Reserve. In the Congo they filmed elephant, buffalo, and hippo, and
in the Queen Elizabeth Park, on the way to Murchison Falls,
crocodiles and birds ; at Lake Nakuru, flamingos, and at the Crater,
lions, rhino, zebra, gnu, ostriches, and the various buck ; and at
Amboseli, giraffe and a few more birds.
The photography was excellent, a feature being that considerable
care had been taken to show the natural habitat of the various mammals
and birds. The commentary, by Murphy, was concise but informative.
The writer has only one criticism of this otherwise splendid production.
The almost continuous, at times distracting, background music bore
no relationship to the pictures--it was quite unnecessary and it would
perhaps have been better had it not been added to the soundtrack.
To Kirkham is due the thanks of all members and guests for
providing such an enjoyable evening's entertainment.

There is at present a world shortage of canary seed. It is being felt
particularly heavily in Great Britain where prices are soaring.
Ordinarily several thousand tons are imported annually from Australia
but owing to drought little or none is available for export. Due to
internal unrest only very small quantities are now coming out of
Turkey. The Moroccan exporters have taken advantage of the
situation by demanding exorbitant prices and the Spanish have
followed their example. The result is that our leading dealers are
having to ask as much as i20.y. to 125^. per cwt. for the finest quality
Spanish canary.

Zoological Gardens, Chester, was breeding them at Shavington over
thirty years ago. He then kept them in a large, open flight, left them to
their own devices and they bred quite successfully, even freely. George
Mottershead says : "I never thought much about it at the time ; in
fact it would have amazed me if anybody had told me that they had
not been bred in captivity before."

Charles Everitt reports from the Edward Marshall Boehm aviaries :
" We have been having a terrible time during the snow, one aviary
completely destroyed and another badly damaged, with complete loss
of all the tropical plants therein. The loss in birds was not as heavy
as it might have been but quite a number of pairs were reduced to
singletons, including the Twelve-wires. Although the blizzard was
exactly four weeks ago we still have a lot of ice and snow about and
the Delaware River has only just been cleared for navigation as far up
as Trenton. For nights on end the temperature has been in the region
of 5 0 to io* and only in the 20's during the day. We had a heat wave
to-day (9th January) for it went up to 45 0 and now all the water on
top of the melting ice makes walking very hazardous--not that we
do much of it--but we do have to get around the aviaries. "

Chicago Park District have approved plans for the complete re-
modelling of the main Bird House. Temporary cages in the back of
the building will be removed and that area will be landscaped with
artificial rock. A shallow, salt-water wading pool and a deeper, fresh-
water pool fed by a stream and waterfall will also be added. In the
centre the large flight cage (100 ft. X 25 ft.) will be removed. This
will then turn the building into one large walk-through flight cage.
The recently remodelled cages on the two opposite long sides of the
building will remain. The spectators' galleries will receive lower
ceilings and the skylights over these areas will be removed. This will
serve the double purpose of keeping the free flying birds in the centre
or back of the building and of eliminating reflections on the glass of
the side cages. New offices will be constructed in conjunction with
a darkened escape-proof entry way. Work on this project is scheduled
to start very shortly."

Charles K. Lucas, President, Avicultural Society of Australia, says
in a recent letter : " My new aviaries are now running well and my
parrots have had a particularly good season. To date I have six
Splendids flying, three Many-coloureds, three Bourkes, twelve
Turquoisines, seven Peach-faced Lovebirds and eight Princess
Alexandras with another five still in the log. One of my hen Princess
Alexandras has turned out to be a champion. Last season she was
double-brooded and had two lots of two, all successfully reared. This is
the first time in sixteen years, since I have been keeping these birds, that
I have had a double-brooded hen. This year she has excelled herself!
She laid five eggs, hatched five young and reared all five in the first
nest and then went back to work and laid another five eggs, all of
which were hatched about a fortnight ago and all of which are doing
well. If the second clutch all survive, it will amount to a total of ten
young birds in the one season--surely an outstanding record !
The finches are also doing well and for the first time in my avicul-
tural career I have a nest of three young Red-faced Parrot Finches due
to fly any day.
I think the season has something to do with results like these. We
had an exceptionally rainy winter, which commenced with seven
inches of rain in April and heavy and consistent rain has fallen up
until about three or four weeks ago. Although the result of all this
was that the aviaries became somewhat waterlogged, the excessive
moisture possibly stimulated the birds and led to these good results."

Im Unbekannten Australien. Dem Lande der Papageien und
Prachtfinken (In Unknown Australia the Land of Parrots and
Grass-finches) by Klaus Immelmann, Verlag Gottfried Helene,
Pfungstadt/Darmstadt, Germany, i960. Price 14.80 DM.
This book is a " must " for all who are interested in Australian bird
life and can read German. The author, who has previously made
detailed studies on Zebra Finches in captivity, spent a year in Australia,
primarily in order to study this species in the wild. He succeeded not
only in studying wild Zebra Finches under very different conditions
in various parts of Australia but also in observing the other Australian
estrildines, and many other birds and mammals, from Duck-billed
Platypuses to Homo sapiens.
His observations were often made under conditions of hardship
having to contend with adverse weather, flies, and mosquitoes.
The Australians met by the author seem to have been a likeable and
hospitable people, but he says many of them had a strong love of
killing and shot almost any living creature they saw, whether of use
to them or not and whether proscribed or protected by law. In view
of this shooting and of the more justified mass slaughter of zosterops
and various psittacines in defence of the crops, it seems hard on genuine
aviculturists over here that the export trade in Australian birds has
been completely banned ; desirable though it was to check its excesses.
Here are a few nuggets from this goldmine of information on many
of our favourite aviary birds. Whereas in most parts the Zebra Finch
breeds when conditions are favourable and only the male searches for
and carries nesting material, in the arid regions of central Australia the
species starts to nest as soon as it starts to rain and both sexes fetch and
carry. This is an adaptation to the very hard living conditions, as in
this area birds can only rear young successfully in the brief period of
abundance that follows the irregular and uncertain rainfall. They
must, therefore, start to breed as soon as it starts to rain, even though
they are then just as hard up for food supplies as before.
The Crimson Finch has largely deserted its original haunts among
the Pandanus trees and in many areas now breeds only in and on
buildings. In the centres of the large cities, however, introduced
European and Asiatic species are dominant. The Spice Finch seems
to be replacing the more beautiful native estrildines in parts of northern
Australia but it is not known whether this successful and versatile
species was introduced or got to Australia by its own efforts.
In spite of intense persecution by man many of the magnificient
parrakeets and cockatoos are as common or commoner than ever.
Others, however, are decreasing. The author points out that the
natural ability that many Australian species have evolved to enable

them to recuperate after their numbers have been decimated by
drought, is now an important factor in their survival in the face of
human persecution.
This book can be recommended to all readers of the Avicultural
Magazine but particularly those interested in the grass finches, the
Gouldian, Bicheno, Firetailed, Crimson and Zebra Finches, on all
of which the author gives a great deal of extremely interesting
information.

FRENCH MOULT RESEARCH AND CROP-MILK IN PARROT-LIKE BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983180677419355" page_id="56315669"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Reading through the back numbers of Avicultural Magazine my attention was
attracted by a report concerning an investigation on French moult sponsored by the
National Council of Aviculture (A. M. 1957, No. 2, page 79). It is stated that there
is good reason to believe that all parrot-like birds feed their young on crop-milk
for at least the first week after hatching and that French moult may, in certain cases,
be associated with a deficiency in this crop-milk.
If indeed parrakeets feed their offspring on crop-milk, it is logical that the produc-
tion of this liquid commences at the end of the breeding period when young birds
are expected. An experience I had during the past season (1960) with a pair of Bourke's
Parrakeets shows, however, that this is definitely not the case.
According to my notes this particular pair started their second clutch on Tuesday
the 7th of June and the last (fourth) egg was laid on the 13th. The hen started brooding
on Sunday the 12th of June. Two days later (the 14th) a young Red-rumped Parrakeet
which had just hatched in an incubator(!) was placed in the nest of this Bourke's for
lack of anything better. I did not expect the Bourke's hen would accept this chick and
even if she did she would not be able to feed the young, not having " crop-milk " at
her disposal. On inspection in the evening of the same day, however, some food could
be seen in the little crop of the chick. There were two more fertile Red-rump eggs
in the incubator and when these hatched a few days later these chicks, too, were placed
under the Bourke's. All three young grew up normally and were reared to inde-
pendence by both foster-parents. They are still in my possession (January, 1961), and
they are healthy birds, perfectly feathered and excellent flyers, without a trace of
French moult.
Conclusion :--Though this is a report of only one case, it is a striking one and it
raises some doubt as to the existence of crop-milk in psittacine birds. If, indeed, crop-
milk is a necessity for the young chicks to grow up normally my Bourke's hen must
have been able not only to produce it at a very awkward time when she could not
possibly expect young ones, but moreover the crop-milk must have been of good
quality too, evidenced by the fact that my three Red-rumped Parrakeets are in such
a fine condition.

CORRESPONDENCE
THE NATIONAL SHOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995561684210526" page_id="56315670"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
An attack against the British bird section at the National Show by Derek Goodwin
in your Magazine, should not be allowed to go unanswered. May I point out that the
size of cages for each species has been standardized by the British Bird and Mule Glub
and the " National " show committee would not accept specimens in cages not up to
the standard required ? Your correspondent states that " everyone does not know that
the birds are not kept in those little show cages." My answer to that is, there is a
British bird corner near the exhibits, where any questions concerning British birds,
their care and management, will be fully answered. Of course, there are many people
who are only too anxious to condemn, without first hearing, or wanting to hear, the
full facts of any case. My own opinion regarding the size of British hardbill show
cages is that they are just right. Larger ones would vastly increase the risk of damage
to the occupant during transit ; a fact that Mr. Goodwin should know, if he has ever
kept birds.
British bird fanciers, indeed all bird keepers, have always had 46 fervent " enemies.
The enemy being people who are almost entirely ignorant of the subject. However,
this branch of Aviculture, the British fancy, still flourishes and its growth is steadily
increasing.
In conclusion, I sincerely hope that Mr. Goodwin's " horrifying " experience of
seeing a Norwich canary, will not lead to nightmares.

I am grateful to the Editor for giving me an opportunity to reply to Mr. Gregg's
letter.
I am aware that the sizes of the " British hardbills " show cages are decided by the
British Bird and Mule Club. That does not alter the bad impression that these tiny
cages give to the general public who visit the shows ; it merely indicates how blind
or indifferent those responsible are to the true interests of aviculture.
No doubt anyone angered by the sight of a Hawfinch or some other bird in its
narrow cell ought to seek out the " questions corner " and ascertain if the birds really
are kept in such cages all the time. But such people are not likely to wish to palaver
with those whom they consider, however mistakenly, to be addicts of a cruel and
unjustifiable pastime. Certainly there is not, as I think there should be, a prominent
notice pointing out that the birds are not kept permanently in small cages.
I have kept birds but should not wish to risk their lives just in order (if I were
lucky) to have them judged better than someone else's on a largely arbitrary and
artificial standard of excellence. It is evident, however, that those who show " British
softbills " manage to transport their exhibits successfully in spite of the large and
attractive show cages that most of them use. And many of these " soft-bills " have
plumage, beaks, and feet more easily damaged than those of finches or buntings.
I am happy to be able to assure Mr. Gregg that I have not suffered recently from
nightmares. This suggestion of his seems, however, to have merit. Some nightmare
sufferers, now oppressed by psychiatrists' assurances as to the intrinsic source of their
bad dreams might be happier, and nearer the truth, if they regarded the less pleasant
sights at the National Cage Bird Show as the causative factor.

I was glad to see in the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine one published
protest concerning the National Show. I visited it on the Saturday. My wife, who
was with me, was so distressed by the sight of the birds on the dealers' stands, and
the condition that they were in, that she has decided not to visit the show in future.
These people have become so accustomed to the conditions under which so many
birds are imported and sold that they are quite unaware of the reputation which
aviculture is gaining for itself. Country after country is framing laws which forbid
the export of birds, and it is the conditions of export and the appalling mortality
which have helped to bring this about. We, who are in touch with ornithologists
as well as aviculturists, are aware that unless serious action is taken foreign birds
will soon be unobtailable, and it is the dealers who will have brought this about,
and the aviculturalists who, through their earlier indifference, will suffer for it.
I would add that I wrote a strong letter of protest at the time to Cage Birds , who
replied in some detail but, as I anticipated, did not print anything about it.

Their affinities and differences
By E. N. T. Vane
(Great Missenden, Bucks., England)
This series of extremely handsome, large parrakeets range over the
south-west regions of the Pacific, being found in Australia and New
Guinea, whence they extend in one direction through the islands of
the Moluccas and Celebes, and in the other--after a distinct break in
the range--to the insular groups of the Fiji and Tonga Islands.

It is difficult to convey the impression of colour values in a black
and white sketch, but the distinction between the two first races is
fairly apparent, as apart from the blue markings on the nape and hind
neck they are almost identical in males and entirely so in females. The
scapulars of chloropterus are almost completely blackish green, whereas in
wilhelminae some of these feathers are bordered terminally with deep
blue, at least in the specimens compared in the British Museum.
Although Figs. 3 and 4 resemble each other superficially in life, their
true differences are slightly exaggerated in the sketch. In the first place
the three species of Alisterus are all much the same size--about

in the face where it becomes much blackened in the ocular region ;
also the green of the body, although of similar " tone " value, is
distinctly more glittering in character. In splendens too, the blue
nuchal patch is smaller, and the primaries and edge of wing are lighter
blue ; no blue shows on the under tail-coverts ; the under wing-
coverts are brighter blue with some red flecks. In the specimen of
dorsalis from which the sketch was made, practically the whole of the
scapulars and back were entirely deep blue ; though a specimen that
lived in my aviaries for several years--during which period she
established her sex by laying several eggs--only had a small, narrow
area, little more than a ring, as her nuchal patch, though most of the
feathers of the scapulars were broadly edged terminally with blue, and
the lower back and the upper surface of the tail were all deep blue.
This specimen was loaned for preservation when it died, but
unfortunately the friend who had the skin was killed in a street
accident and I was unable to secure its return under the circumstances
and it was lost entirely. The sexes of dorsalis are alike and neither
possesses a pale wing bar--this in itself seems unusual within one genus
(some sexually alike, others unlike). The bill is blackish with reddish
areas on the sides.
In Prosopeia splendens , the bill is very much larger and of different
shape. Although the sexes are alike, the males are larger generally and
particularly in the head and bill, seldom can an error be made in
choosing among live specimens.
Owing to the striking similarity of the general colour pattern
between some species, the three genera have given rise to considerable
confusion and consequent taxonomic revision so that it is far from an
easy matter for anyone not well acquainted with these changes,
clearly to distinguish them ; and reference to earlier authors may well
increase the difficulty. Indeed, if some recent references to the large,
sexually dimorphic, Eclectus (?) Parrots from the Solomon Islands,
Larius roratus solomonensis (Rothschild and Hartert) (emended to Lorius
in Peters), as the " King Parrot 55 are allowed to pass without comment
the confusion is likely to increase.
To clarify this last point which is of minor consideration here, the
name Eclectus , Wagler, was in constant use for this genus of parrots of
such unique sexual dimorphism from 1832 until 1915, when Mathews
discovered that Boddaert had used a prior title Larius (1783) which he
emended to Lorius. Thus under the priority rule the well-established
Eclectus was displaced much against the wishes of many scientists who
had used the term for the whole of their lives. In spite of this, the
name persists in common usage in many parts of the World to this day.
To apply the common name of " King Parrot " to a species which was

E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS 8 1
named the Solomon Eclectus Parrot by its authors in 1901, is bound
to lead to future confusion. Indeed, Ernst Mayr (Birds of South-west
Pacific) used this name, which was followed by Cain and Galbraith
(Ibis 1956, p. 129) and thus repetition adds to the trouble. Admittedly
this name may be used by local residents or natives in a locality, but
when another species has been accorded world-wide use of the same
name for many years (in this case over one hundred), this improper
appropriation of the same name is to be discouraged.
Reverting to the three genera under consideration, they are charac-
terized by their large size, some 14 to 18 inches in overall length
including the long, flat, wedgeshaped tail, of which the rectrices are
not distinctly tapered distally, nor much graduated, and the tips are
rather broad and rounded. (The Crimson-wings have a comparatively
shorter tail.) Next, by their brilliant color patterns and general shape,
in which respect the similarity between the Fijian and Moluccan
species is particularly noticeable ; also the sexes in these races are alike
whereas in the Kings of Australia and New Guinea the sexes differ.
Historical
Gould first established the genus Aprosmictus when he wrote to the
Zoological Society in 1842, from Australia, saying that on closer
acquaintance with the genus Platycercus he was of the opinion that
two species, namely erythropterus (Crimson-wings) and cyanopygius
(Kings) should be removed on account of differences in habits, colour
pattern, and certain anatomical and morphological differences,
enumerated in his letter which was read at the Society's Proceedings.
Some years later, in 1865, when writing his Handbook to the Birds of
Australia , Gould realized on reflection that Crimson-wings and Kings
also required to be separated since their colour patterns were quite
different ; their tails too, had different formulae. He may have
also recalled writing elsewhere, how he had watched flocks of
Crimson-wings feeding, and what a wonderful spectacle they made,
" especially when there were a number of adult males in the flock,
when their crimson shoulders stood out against all surrounding
objects." Now this does not agree as a fair description of a species
named " aprosmictus " which literally means " one who does not
mix "--" a solitary individual normally ". So he decided to remove
the more sociable Crimson-wing to a new genus which he called
Ptistes , under which title they appear in the B.M. Catalogue.
Having named two species as co-types of Aprosmictus in 1842 Gould
simply removed erythropterus to be the type of his new genus, and left
cyanopygius behind as the type for the less " Non-mixing " genus.
In my view Gould did this deliberately and knew quite well what he
was doing. Quite incidentally, the name cyanopygius was subsequently
revised to scapularis. A modern analogy might be to say that there

82 E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS
had been two "joint managing directors " ; one retired to take up
a new post, leaving the other in charge.
Gould was not to know that during his absence, Gray had been
working in England incessantly to produce a better classification of
birds and had published several works on the subject, in one or more
of which, he had listed the genus Aprosmictus bracketing thereafter
erythropterus as the type. Either Gray did not notice that Gould had
named two types, or he attached no significance to the fact. Quite
possibly at that time there was no rule to give significance thereto.
In 1911 Mathews discovered what he called "Gould's blunder",
and by that time there was a rule. The question is, how could Gould
have complied with rules of which he was not aware, and which had
probably not been made at that time, possibly not until some years
after his death. Be that as it may, Mathews cancelled Ptistes , as
invalid, removed the name Aprosmictus from the Kings ( cyanopygius
= scapularis) where it had been in use for seventy years since 1842,
and transferred it to the Crimson-wings ( erythropterus) because he
contended that Gray had so designated the type, simply by adding it
in parentheses after the generic name. Although careful search was
made in several of Gray's works on genera and species, no definite
statement could be found anywhere to the effect that " I hereby
subsequently designate ... as the type " or " I hereby restrict ... as
the type Thus the Kings, scapularis , became nameless, so Mathews
named them " Alisterus " in honour of his own son. He named
scapularis as the type and listed the species which the genus embraced,
the Australian Kings ( scapularis ), the Green-wing Kings of New
Guinea (chloropterus) , and the " Island " Kings (amboinensis) , of which
further sub-species have since been discovered.
Not unnaturally many ornithologists who had been referring to
these birds for over seventy years by their former title did not approve
of the change, and some even refused to recognize the new proposals.
This appeared to annoy Mathews intensely, and he wrote to Ibis
(April, 1916) accusing Ogilvie-Grant, and others who shared his view,
of personal bias. In 1917 Mathews in his excellent work, Birds of
Australia , Vol. VI, repeated all this taxonomic wrangle, again listing
all the Kings covered by Alisterus which in fact, comprised all the
Australian, New Guinea, and Moluccan species then known, adding :--
" All the preceding generally agree in size and coloration, and have
the same wing formula and bill structure, and their range is East
Australia and the Moluccas and New Guinea. It should be noted that
as far as we know them, the females are quite different in coloration,
having the head and neck green, and other differences . . . ". He then
proceeded to point out how the Fijian genus differed from all these,
in that the sexes were alike, and other differences of characters.
In this observation, even Mathews was at fault, since the " Island "

E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS 83
Kings do not differ in colour pattern between the sexes. This fact,
coupled with the similarity of colour pattern, led me to the conclusion
as many early writers had believed, that Alisterus amboinensis and
Prosopeia splendens (later regarded as a subspecies of tabuensis) were
very close to each other, and eventually led to many subsequent
discussions with the late Duke of Bedford, who as most aviculturists
know, was ever ready to assist anyone with psittacine problems.
He had considerable experience with both genera in captivity, and
therefore I am pleased to be able to quote from his writings which he
amplified to me in discussions in days gone by, in the hope that this
may help others to distinguish between these three genera, which are
dealt with in turn as follows :--
1. Genus Aprosmictus (in Peters) The Crimson-wings
Only two species are recognized though these have been separated
further into local races or subspecies. Obviously they are closely related
to the Kings or Gould would never have regarded them as of the same
genus, nevertheless, as anyone who has kept both for some time will
agree, each has peculiarities of habit. Races of Australian birds,
erythropterus, have been separated on the characteristic of size alone,
and the New Guinea race is very similar ; only differing in the
smaller size and having less black on the back in the males. Sexes are
different as the females do not have black backs though there is some
red in the wing ; immatures all resemble the adult female, full adult
plumage not being attained until they are over two years old, therefore
the selection of true pairs from young birds is not possible.
The second species, jonquillaceus, is found in the islands of Timor
and Wetar, the sexes are more difficult to distinguish at any age as the
males have no black on the back, females only differing from them by
the amount of blue present on the upper wing ; even this appears to
vary individually so that some females are quite distinctly marked with
blue whilst others are almost lacking, and in the males the colour is
more pronounced in some than others. Certainly one specimen
examined was labelled as a female, but looked blue enough to be
a male. The late Duke rated these birds very poorly in his estimation:--
"For many years I longed to possess the Timor Crimson-wing
(Ptistes jonquillaceus) [the old generic name], but when my ambition
was at length realized I found that the whole order of Parrots does not
contain a more ill-conditioned brute, nor one more tiresome from the
avicultural standpoint--not only does he pluck himself with more
frequency and persistence and less excuse than any other psittacine
bird, but he kills his wife as a matter of habit, and, if he should be
tame (?), he hates the human race--and especially his owner--with an
intensity that must be seen in order to be believed ! " (Bedford,
Avicultural Magazine, 1950, p. 100).

84 E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS
The interesting point about this genus is that there are two species,
one of which inhabits mainland regions and the sexes are different ;
whilst the other is of insular origin and the sexes are difficult to
distinguish. Both are admittedly 44 wife-beaters ", but the island race
appears even more evil-tempered in this direction than the mainland
bird. A parallel will be mentioned later.
Before leaving this genus, mention should be made of a very
beautiful bird which was illustrated in Gould's Birds of New Guinea as
Aprosmictus insignissimus . This was mentioned by Peters (p. 250) who
noted that it was now considered to be a natural hybrid between
Alisterus s. scapularis X Aprosmictus e. erythropterus . On reference to
Prestwich's Records , p. 179, it transpires that this cross has been produced
on at least two occasions in captivity, and the brief description by
Jean Delacour of a male of a pair he saw agrees well with the illustra-
tion in Gould mentioned above. Thus might aviculture confirm such
doubtful matters and prove the close affinity of the two genera beyond
dispute.

aviculturists, the males being magnificent, showy birds with the head
and most of the underparts bright scarlet; the wings and mantle dark
green with a touch of blue where the green of the mantle and the red
of the head meet, and with a longitudinal light green stripe on the
upper wing-coverts ; the tail very long, broad, and flat and con-
siderably larger than in the Crimson-wing. The female is much more
soberly clad, being mainly dark green without blue on the hind neck ;
a reddish wash on the greenish underparts ; the green wing-stripe is
usually absent, though I have bred some hens in which this has
developed to a certain degree. I also possessed one hen with a distinct
red fleck on one side of her head. She lived for many years in my
aviaries and eventually laid eggs so I had no doubt about her maturity
or sex.
Only two races were recognized by Peters, though more have been
proposed, but most probably did not prove to be sufficiently constant
in variation to merit racial distinction. These differences referred to
size rather than colour. Immature birds resemble the adult female
but young males soon begin to acquire some reddish tinge to the
upper mandible whilst the females' remain dark, though some adult
females sometimes show a little orange on the base of the mandible, but

not enough to be confused with the really orange-red bill of the adult
male. It takes at least two years for adult plumage to be assumed.
Occasionally a young male shows considerable flecks of red in the
parts that will eventually become entirely so in his first moult. But
the number of aviculturists who have acquired a supposed pair of
Kings only to find that they had an adult and an immature male will
confirm that young birds are impossible to sex.
(b) chloropterus . The New Guinea Green-wing Kings are very close
to the Australian species, the males, if anything, being even more
handsome. As so often happens among psittacines in the tropics the
more northerly population are somewhat brighter in colour and
slightly less in size.
The red of the Green-wing King is darker ; there is much more
blue on the nape ; the characteristic wing-stripe is broader and a
much paler apple green. Again, the females are duller than the males
and immatures resemble the females. However, these Kings inhabit
the lower slopes of the mountain ranges of New Guinea and are
frequently separated by physical barriers from neighbouring races.
This appears to have resulted in the naming of several sub-species,
some of which are scarcely tenable, since differences are attributed to
one sex only in some cases, whereas elsewhere another subspecies has
been nominated for a slight difference in the opposite sex. When it is
realized that the species takes three years to acquire full adult plumage,
it is obvious that individual variation is bound to occur which
collectors, in their eagerness to discover new races, might well imagine
a greater variation in their specimens than did in fact exist. More
recent authors, such as Peters and Mayr have synonymized some of
these races.
Females of chloropterus and scapularis can be distinguished from each
other by the smaller size of the former, which also have a deeper blue
rump ; darker reddish wash on the underparts, and the under tail-
coverts are blue basally with red edges as compared with those of
scapularis which are green basally with red edges. These differences
are not nearly so easy to observe in a living specimen as their enumera-
tion on paper would suggest.
Some years ago I reared a number of hybrid Alisterus c. chloropterus
X Alisterus scapularis but only retained one male specimen until it
attained full adult plumage when three years of age. This bird was
almost indistinguishable from its male parent. The chloropterus nominate
race is clearly distinguishable by the " lozenge-shaped " patch of blue
on the nape and hind head (see sketch).
(c) amboinensis. The ce Island Kings 55 have a similar colour pattern
to others of the genus Alisterus with two important differences. The
colours are generally much darker in hue on average ; and there is
no near vertical, light wing-stripe. Moreover, females and immatures

86 E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS
are almost identical with the males--quite unlike the Australian or
other New Guinea species.
Various sub-species are recognized as populations of different
islands, which only differ from each other in size or slight coloration
to some degree. In one subspecies, hypophonius from Halmahera, green
is lacking in the plumage, being replaced by blue, and the crimson
underparts are also purplish washed.
The really interesting points are that instead of the sexes differing--
as Mathews appeared to believe--they are alike in colour pattern.
Secondly, these " Island " species are less even-tempered than other
Alisterus --a characteristic of singular significance in the view of the
late Duke of Bedford who frequently discussed this matter with me.
He drew an interesting analogy between the two genera Aprosmictus ,
Crimson-wings, and Alisterus , Kings, emphasizing that each included
one species of mainland location in which the sexes were dimorphic yet
tolerably well disposed towards each other ; as opposed to which,
each genus contained a species in which the sexes were alike and
extremely bad tempered, both being of insular location. This is
supported by the following avicultural observations :--
" Between the species of Alisterus in which the sexes are alike and
those in which they differ in appearance there are fairly marked
points of resemblance and also fairly marked points of distinction.
In voice the former group are definite Kings, but in temperament both
sexes are fierce birds, addicted to murder, which the Australian King
is not."
" The climate of the East seems, indeed, to have a bad effect on the
manners of the Parrakeets of the Australasian group " (Bedford,
Avicultural Magazine, 1950, p. 99).
A female Salwatty King, A. a. dorsalis , lived in my own aviaries for
a number of years. Being unable to procure a mate of her own species,
she was provided successively with two Australian Kings, scapularis ,
as mates. In spite of her smaller size, she eventually killed both of
these. Thereafter she was given a cock Pennant, Platycercus splendens ,
with whom mating was observed and she went to nest and laid eggs
which were not fertile, though she sat well. This confirmed the
explanation offered by the Duke, that male Kings, accustomed to
a quietly garbed, respectable looking female, failed to recognize this
" over-dressed " specimen as a suitable partner at all. So enraged
was the hen at this affront to her sex, that she never forgave them,
and thereafter refused to have anything to do with them.
Nevertheless, the Duke did succeed in crossing a Crimson-wing male,
Aprosmictus erythropterus , with a female of the small Sula Island race,
Alisterus amboinensis sulaensis (see Prestwich, Records , p. 170; also
Tavistock, Parrot-like Birds , p. 248). Although these hybrids were
never proved fertile, it was fairly evident that both sexes were reared.

E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS 87
Both sexes had red patches in their green areas when immature, and
took three years to assume full adult plumage.
" A three-year-old . . . hybrid ... is now moulting into adult
plumage and is showing a quantity of light yellow-green feathers on
each wing. It is curious that by crossing a Parrakeet with a red wing-
bar with one with no wing-bar at all you should produce offspring with
a pale yellow-green wing-bar rather like that of the other species of
Kings. The wing of a Sula Island of either sex is uniform dark green
(Tavistock, Avicultural Magazine, 1929, p. 256).
This only emphasizes the absolute unpredictability of hybridizing,
and raises another interesting point. A species cannot be persuaded to
hybridize within its own genus, yet does so with a species of another
closely related genus and succeeds in producing progeny. Neither
should it be forgotten that Aprosmictus insignissimus of Gould's work
previously referred to, is now believed to be a cross between members
of these two genera.
Before leaving Alisterus reference must be made to the excellent
review of the genus by Prof. O. Neumann in 1926. He took the view
that they were all of one species, or " Formengruppen " which he
designated amboinensis , and listed all the races as subspecies thereof.
He gave very useful " keys " as aids to identification, and pointed out
one distinctive feature, namely that immature specimens had a tail
characteristic, the rectrices were pointed at the tips with pinkish
edgings, whilst in adults that had moulted out, the tips were then
rounded and the pinkish edges lacking. This would enable museum
specimens to be more readily identified and give some indication of
the age of a specimen. However, so far as I know, this species has only
been bred in captivity once, in 1940, when no observations were
recorded. Certainly this does not apply to the Australian species, for
I can well remember how difficult it was to remove well-grown
young birds at the end of the season, one had to be very careful not
to take out the adult breeding hen in error, and it was quite impossible
to distinguish them with certainty.
Neither Peters nor Mayr accepted the view that Alisterus were so
closely allied as to be of one species, and regard them as of three
specific forms, which avicultural experiences certainly support and
may even suggest that the division between the Australian and New
Guinea " mainland " species on the one part and the " Island "
|&lt; amboinensis ) on the other part is even greater.

88 E. N. T. VANE-CRIMSON-WINGS, KINGS, AND SHINING PARRAKEETS
regarded them as representatives of the same species. It therefore
remains to indicate their points of difference.
Prosopeia are generally much larger in size, especially in the bill,
which is deeper, blacker, and rougher on the surface. Although the
sexes have the same colour pattern, they differ in size, the males being
larger particularly in respect to the head and bill. Their colour too,
is darker, even in the splendens subspecies, the other races of tabuensis
being almost wine coloured. The green in all of them although of
equal " tone " is much more glittering in character ; they are
noticeably darker around the lores and face ; the wing formula is
slightly different.
For more practical comparison of habits and temperament, let us
consider once more some of the observations of the late Duke of Bedford
who had several specimens in his collection at different times :--
1. " On account of a certain superficial resemblance in their colour
scheme they have been classed with the King Parrakeets and even--
Heaven knows why--with the Broadtails. As a matter of fact they
have nothing in common with either and are totally different in
character and habits. Not much seems to be known of their nesting,
but two eggs appear to be laid in a hollow tree and the sitting hen is
fed by her mate " (Tavistock, Parrots and Parrot-like Birds , p. 186).
Casey Wood (Emu, 1923) recorded three eggs in the nests he found.
2. " I do not think that, beyond the fact that they both belong to
the same order of birds and have a certain superficial resemblance in
form and colour, there is the least affinity between the members of
the subgenera Alisterus and Pyrrhulopsis [ = Prosopeia ]. Having kept
both, I can say with confidence that it is difficult to find two groups of
Parrakeets more utterly unlike in every respect " (Bedford, Avicul-
tural Magazine, 1950, p. 99).
3. " Old writers, misled by a certain superficial resemblance in
form and color arrangement, imagined that they were nearly related to
the Kings ( Aprosmicti ) [= Alisterus] , but as a matter of fact they are
sharply differentiated from the latter by their larger bills ; the peculiar
silky texture of the green areas of their plumage, their musky odor, and
by nearly all their manners and habits. They form, indeed, a small
and very distinct genus confined to the Islands of the Fiji group. There
are five species or subspecies, but of these only two are strikingly
distinct."
" The sexes are much alike, the female differing in the smaller size
of the head and beak ; and the young also appear to resemble the
adults to a considerable degree save that their bills, instead of being
black, show a considerable amount of whitish horn colour " (Tavistock,
Aviculture (U.S.A.), 1931, p. 297).
Bahr ( Ibis , 1912) remarked that the eye of nestlings was brown,
that of the adults orange to yellowish, but not a sexual distinction.

When an attempt at hybridizing the two genera was made in the
Duke's aviaries, although the birds appeared to tolerate each other,
the eggs were infertile.
Thus it is fairly conclusively shown that there should be no difficulty
in distinguishing any of these birds, in spite of external similarities.
And the affinities between the two are not close at all, and even the
geographical break occurring between them seems to emphasize this
fact.
The accompanying sketches may make the points of difference
easier to appreciate, although it is difficult to express difference in
colour values in black and white.

BREEDING OF THE BROWN MANNIKIN
Lonchura fuscata

<bodyText confidence="0.99002168" page_id="56315695"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
A pair of Brown Mannikins came into my possession in February,
i960. They had been imported by the late Mr. W. J. C. Frost in 1958.
I had only once before seen this species, in 1928 when I was acting as
Curator to the late Mr. G. H. Gurney, who then informed me that the
pair in his collection were Cinnamon Tuxas. I have been unable to
ascertain the origin of this name but assume it to be the native name in
Timor.
I kept them in my bird-room until mid-May when I turned them
out into my aviary. They quickly settled down and did not appear to
mind the few other birds--two pairs of Budgerigars, a pair of Golden-
breasted Buntings, and a Red-headed Finch.
By the end of May they were busy carrying dried grass and making a
nest in an old Budgerigar nest-box. The first egg was laid on 1st June.
Both birds seemed to take it in turns to occupy the nest-box. I did not
interfere with them in any way, but after they had been sitting for about
eighteen days I examined the box and found four eggs, all of which
were infertile. As perhaps one might expect they were pure white,
rather elongate. I cleaned out the box and the Mannikins were very
soon busy carrying in a variety of material, pieces of paper, small
feathers, but mostly hay and moss. The hen disappeared inside but
this time it would have been quite impossible to see what was going on,
the box was so crammed with nesting material. I again left them quite
alone. I particularly noticed that both birds took turns in the
incubation which I would estimate to be about sixteen days. Both
birds then started visiting the box very regularly. I supplied plenty of

live food but it was never touched ; large quantities of green food were
eaten, particularly chickweed, and seeding grasses.
At the end of August one young one left the nest. It put one in mind
of a young British Bullfinch. A second left the nest a few days later,
but it appeared to be rather weakly and died after two or three days.
The first is a fine, strong bird and is now quite as large as its parents.
As this species will be unfamiliar to the majority of our members it
may not be out of place to give a brief description of it.
It is light chocolate-brown above ; blackish on the crown ; cheeks
and ear-coverts white ; throat black ; breast light brown and
separated from the white belly by a band of black ; tail blackish ;
beak leaden. The sexes are alike in plumage, and the size is slightly less
than that of a Java Sparrow.
As described above, A. Martin has bred the Brown Mannikin
Lonchura fuscata. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

RAIN-BATHING

By G. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)
One of the rewards of aviculture is the insight that it gives into the
habits and behaviour of birds, much of which might rarely, or never,
be seen in the wild. It was through watching captive and feral birds
that I became aware of the occurrence of rain-bathing, about which
little seems to have been recorded.
I was very impressed by the first view that I had of it, although it
must be familiar to many people. It occurred in a flock of feral pigeons
(Columba livid) which were resting on a dry day in summer when
a sudden shower of rain fell. Instead of seeking shelter most of the
birds squatted down and lay on one side with a wing extended
vertically above them, the posture being apparently the same as that
used in sunbathing. The birds appeared to be responding to a sensual
stimulus by exposing to that stimulus a greater surface area of the
body than would be affected were their posture normal. Since shelter
was available, but not used, one may suspect that they derived
satisfaction from this behaviour ; and since water was available, and
since pigeons are capable of bathing in the typical fashion, the posture
was not necessary in order for bathing to take place.

I was familiar with the typical bathing that most birds indulge in,
with its squatting, head-ducking, and wing-fluttering ; and with the
posture of a bird out of cover in heavy rain, moving with wings
partly drooped and shaken a little at intervals to shed the accumulated
water ; but I had not previously witnessed the use of a special posture
for deliberate rain-bathing.
I have since seen this behaviour a number of times but, up till now,
only from feral pigeons and not from other doves.
I next saw rain-bathing, in this sense of deliberate exposure of the
body and plumage to rain, by a pair of Blue-winged Parrotlets ( Forpus
passerinus ) in an outdoor aviary. Again, shelter that they were
accustomed to use was nearby. As the rain began they called noisily
and, bowing the head down low near the perch, they spread their
wings horizontally to their full extent and, with tail spread, but
a little lowered, moved clumsily about the perch in this posture for
several minutes. On another occasion the cock took up this posture
while clinging, head downwards, to the wire side of the aviary.
In this position the vivid blue of wings and rump were fully displayed
and he looked like some gorgeous butterfly.
I saw this posture again in a flock of Cockatiels (. Nymphicus
hollandicus) in an aviary at Whipsnade Zoo. After a prolonged dry
summer my visit coincided with the first rain for weeks. As it started
to rain there was the same outburst of noisy calling that I had heard
in the case of the parrotlets, and bird after bird lowered its head and
spread its wings and tail in the fashion already described, the white
wing-patches suddenly flashing into view.
The only published description and photographs that I have
discovered as yet are in Dr. Maurice Burton's book Phoenix re-born.
He gives a photograph of an African Grey Parrot ( Psittacus erithacus )
in this posture, but from the movements of the head and partial
spreading of the tail describes it as 4 ' anting without ants ", although
there is no evidence that a parrot will adopt such a posture when
ants are present. He also quotes a description of a parrot adopting
this posture " . . . when sprayed with warm water on the breast and
wings ". This bird, an Amazon, was described as having brought its
wings forward until the tips of the first primaries were pressed together
when fully displaying this posture.
I was uncertain whether parrots might not use this posture for sun-
bathing, although I had never seen one do so. I discussed this with
Mr. E. N. T. Vane who was able to tell me, from his very extensive
knowledge of the parrots, that rain-bathing occurred widely among
the parrots and that many species would hang head downwards when
doing so. He confirmed my suspicion that sunbathing is seldom seen
in parrots, which seem to spend more time avoiding direct sunlight ;
but when he had seen it on various occasions from a number of species

it had occurred on the ground, the bird lying over to one side and
extending only one wing at a time, fully spread, either to one side or
up above the body.
From this it would appear that rain-bathing parrots use a special
posture which differs from that used when sunbathing. Some species,
such as the Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), which normally
inhabit grassland, bathe by rolling in wet grass. As far as I know these
species do not indulge in rain-bathing of the type described. The
recognition of wet vegetation as a bathing medium appears to be
innate. A friend had a Budgerigar which had been caged from its
youth, but which was allowed to fly around in the house. He could
not persuade it to bath in water but one day when some watercress
was being washed the bird descended and proceeded to wallow in it,
and subsequently behaved in the same fashion whenever green, leafy
vegetables were washed.
From the evidence available so far it would appear that only
pigeons and parrots possess these special rain-bathing postures.
I find it hard to suggest a reason for this and I would not be surprised
to find that the habit is more widespread but has passed unrecorded.
If anyone has observed special rain-bathing habits in other families
I would be most interested to hear of it.

By Dr. Henry Quinque (Paris, France)
For some years I have always kept those wonderful birds, the nectar
feeders, in my aviaries. Their metallic reflections, incomparable allure,
and liveliness have always attracted me.
To begin with I kept a dozen Sunbirds together with a pair of
Yellow-winged Sugar Birds in an aviary in my salon. Believing them
to be extremely sensitive to cold, I overheated my flat for their benefit.
This experience revealed a number of mistakes--the fights were
incessant and often bloody ; the resplendent red of some of the Sunbirds
turned to a dull yellow after the first moult--in fact, I was keeping these
birds under very bad conditions, which I afterwards changed
completely.
In spite of the many mistakes I made to begin with it was in my
salon in Paris in an aviary (measuring i m 80 in height, i m 50 wide,
and o m 80 deep) containing twelve Sunbirds and a pair of Yellow-
winged Sugar Birds that I had my first thrilling experience.
During the third week of May, 1956, the female Yellow-winged
Sugar Bird began to be very interested in a laurel in a pot in the corner
of the aviary. She examined the various branches minutely in search
of the one which would be most suitable for her future activities.
During this time the male was aggressive to all the Sunbirds which
wished to perch in the laurel and did not hesitate to chase off birds
much larger than itself. Some days later the female carried about
blades of dried grass which she did not place in the shrub but rapidly
dropped them. Then on 28th May, she really began the construction
of a nest on the level part of the fork of a branch. On the following day
I removed all the Sunbirds from the aviary in order to leave it entirely
for the Yellow-winged Sugar Birds.
In spite of this disturbance the female did not stop the work she had
started ; for five days she carried pieces of ravelled-out hemp, cut into
lengths of 8 or 10 cm., coconut fibres, and blades of green grass which
had been provided for her. The result was a wonderful nest made in
the shape of a cup, entirely lined with hemp with a few white feathers
woven in. The cup measured 8 cm. in diameter inside, but was very
deep and conical so when the female was on the nest she disappeared
entirely from view except for her beak and tail which were raised
obliquely upwards. The male took no part whatever in the building
of the nest, but he followed the female about wherever she went. On
several occasions he made the courtship display, but I did not observe

any copulation while the nest was being built. When the female had
finished and shaped the nest by lateral movements of the body she laid
two eggs. The eggs were laid on the 3rd and 4th June in the morning ;
they were globular, sky-blue in colour with tobacco brown spots, which
were more dense at each end. For twenty days I refrained from going
into the aviary to look at the nest, but when I did so I was most
disappointed to find only one egg which was perforated at the side.
A few days after I had taken away the perforated egg the female laid
two further eggs from which two perfect youngsters were hatched.
Unfortunately the day after they were hatched I found them on the
sand of the aviary. After having put them back three times, I had to
pick them up again three times from the ground, where they had
obviously been thrown out by the female. I realised that it was useless
to persist as the male was frequently making the courtship display and
the female evidently wished to lay again. I therefore took the tiny birds
and put them in an artificial nest inside a heated box. I succeeded in
feeding them with crushed drosophila and syrup by means of a pipette,
but they died at the end of the third day.
Two weeks later I saw several matings and the female laid two more
eggs. Two young birds hatched out, but their development was
relatively slow though they were fed perfectly by the female for
fifteen days when she suddenly stopped taking them any food, although
I had taken the precaution of putting a large number of drosophila into
the aviary which was entirely covered with fine meshed material.
Shortly after the death of these two young birds (which I have
preserved in spirit) the female laid a single egg. This hatched into a
magnificent young bird which developed rapidly, but was also
abandoned on the fifteenth day when it was almost completely
feathered. The summer over the male began to assume its eclipse
plumage (the date of which varies considerably in each individual) and
things remained as they were for this season.
After this year, 1956, full of hopes and disappointments, I moved all
the birds which I kept in my flat to my large aviaries with heated
shelters which are situated in the centre of France. In 1957, in spite of
much more favourable conditions the same pair did not make a nest.
In 1958 the male escaped from the aviary ; the following year
I procured a male, but the female died.
It was in 1960--thanks to a new pair which I bought at the beginning
of the year--that I had the very great pleasure of success. I bought a
female on the banks of the Seine on a very cold morning in January,
though I made this acquisition without much hope of being able to
save it, for I took home a ball of feathers chilled with cold and put it
in a cage in my flat. By March it was a magnificent female and I took
her to the country where a male resplendent in health and beauty was
waiting for her. My aviaries are situated a few kilometers from Limoges

in the centre of France ; unfortunately the climate is continental, it
rains a great deal and in winter the temperature oftens drops to
15 0 Centigrade. At the other extreme, the summers are very hot and
interrupted by violent and frequent thunderstorms. For this reason
I have had the shelters made with double walls with glass wool in
between. These shelters are heated by thermostatically controlled
electric radiators and open on to a wired flight, io m. long by 2 m.
50 wide and the same in height, for each compartment. I put the pair
of Sugar Birds, in company with two pairs of Dufresne's Waxbill and
eight Red-headed Parrot Finches, in one of these compartments which
was planted with bushes in the outside flight.
At the beginning of May I again observed the courtship display of
the Yellow-winged Sugar Birds ; the two birds perch side by side on
the same branch, stand up stiffly to the fullest extent, throw back the
head, holding the beak half open, and raise the tail vertically. They
then both utter a stiffled, sharp, trilling note which is more like the noise
of a cricket than a song. I have often noticed the same attitude when a
Yellow-winged Sugar Bird threatens another bird near it.
On 20th May, i960, the female began to construct a nest in the
shelter. Disregarding all the bushes planted in the outside flight and
the boxes placed inside, she carried the material to the branches of
bamboo placed inside the shelter. Whilst the nest constructed in Paris
by the first pair was a work of art, this one was shapeless and careless,
consisting only of a heap of dried grass scarcely hollowed out in the
centre ; it was placed in full view on a few small branches of dried
bamboo. After three days (23rd May) the female laid an egg followed
by a second the next day. The eggs were identical in every way to the
preceding ones, in number (never more than two), in the coloration
of azure blue, and in size (being about one and a half times the size
of the egg of a Gouldian Finch, but much more stubby and globular).
The two young hatched fourteen days after the laying of the first
egg. One of them fell on the cement floor and was killed, but the second
succeeded in remaining, for better or worse, in its uncomfortable nest.
Like those which I had already had the opportunity of seeing, it had
some downy feathers, blackish in colour, and very fine, especially on
the head. A few days later the body was entirely covered in really
black down, which is contrary to what I have read on the subject. The
beak is as short as that of a seed-eater, but very wide at the base and
very pointed at the tip and there is a bluish-grey membrane at the
corners.
The food was brought by the female only and during the first eight
days consisted entirely of soft insects caught in the outside flight. Later
the female frequently fetched fruits and nectar from the bottles placed
for this purpose. The female pushed her beak right down the throat
of the youngster to feed it. The male always remained near the nest

during this operation, but never took part in feeding the young (nor,
for that matter, did he feed the female while she was brooding).
How the young bird managed to remain on the pile of grass which
served as a nest in spite of the incessant passing of the Red-headed
Parrot Finches remains one of the many mysteries of nature. By the
third week its beak was already half as long as that of its parents, the
plumage was grey-green with some touches of yellow and the legs were
completely black. At this time the bird left the nest for its first flight ;
the parents took great care of it, always perching each side of it and
accompanying it wherever it went. The female continued to feed it
for a month and in begging for food it assumed the display posture of
the adults shivering the wings like all young birds. After it left the nest
the male never gave the youngster any food, but he guarded it and
mercilessly chased away the Red-headed Parrot Finches if they came
near.
A month after its first flight the young Yellow-winged Sugar Bird
fed itself, took nectar from the feeding bottles, and caught insects in
flight with the same agility as its parents. As I write these lines this
magnificent bird is six months old ; it is completely tame and allows
one to come within 50 cm. of it. Sometimes it threatens its father,
which is in partial eclipse plumage, adopting the same attitude as the
adults. The colour of its plumage is grass-green much brighter than
that of the female ; the underpart of the wings is bright yellow, but the
outer surface of the remiges is black which is an almost certain
distinctive characteristic of the male of this species. A final point
worthy of note is that the legs are black, whereas those of the female are
rose-coloured and the male red.
I think this breeding success should be an encouragement to all those
who like to keep nectar feeding birds or who hope one day to do so.
Actually, these birds have a false reputation for fragility and extreme
delicacy for, as a matter of fact, all they need is a little warmth in
winter, absolute cleanliness, and the necessary food.

By M. Ellis (London, England)
This is a short account of a visit in June, i960, to the Pyrenees
(French), the range of mountains separating the Iberian Peninsula
from France.
The first day began with a fine view of a Black Kite ( Milvus migrans)
from the train travelling from Lourdes to Pierrefitte Nestalas. From
here my two friends and myself set about walking to Gavarnie. On
leaving the town the first birds to be seen were the familiar House
Sparrows, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Goldfinches, Blackbirds, Linnets,
Skylarks, Corn Buntings, and a Spotted Flycatcher. A solitary
Egyptian Vulture (. Neophron percnopterus) flew over the road some
distance ahead of us. Bullfinches, Blue Tits, Great Tits, Magpies,
Jays, Carrion Crows, Sparrow Hawk, Green and Greater Spotted
Woodpeckers were seen as we proceeded along the road. Often
seen in the fast-flowing stream running parallel to the road was
the Black-bellied Dipper ( Cinclus cinclus), differing from the British
bird, as its name implies, in the colour of its underparts which are
black instead of chestnut.
Luz was the next town we passed through. Here the Red-backed
Shrike was common, perching on a post, or in a low bush--one
preening, was still wet from bathing. A number of the commoner
passerines were to be found around the town, including Serins ( Serinus
canarius) and Chiffchaffs. Crag Martins ( Ptyonoprogne rupestris ) and
Buzzards were now frequently to be seen along the road. High above
a Golden Eagle and a Booted Eagle ( Hieraetus pennatus) were soaring
quite close to each other. The former were now to be seen at regular
intervals high above the cliffs towering on either side of the road.
A large family of Grey Wagtails were amongst the birds inhabiting
Gedre, the next town we passed through. The stretch of road leaving
the town was rather dull and it was rapidly becoming dark. But we
pressed on, and spent the night just outside Gavarnie.
We set off early the next morning and soon reached Gavarnie
(4,500 feet). Lying at the foot of one of the most magnificent sights
in Europe, the Cirque de Gavarnie. The town is very popular and
visited by hundreds of tourists daily. A Peregrine Falcon was the only
bird to be seen. Leaving the town, we soon saw Citril Finches
(\0x25A0Carduelis citrinella ), Serins, Yellowhammers, and Black Redstarts.
Adding Tree Pipit, Mistle Thrush, and Jay, on the return journey.
Soon we came upon what were to be our constant companions for
the next few weeks, the Red-billed Chough ( Coracia pyrrhocorax ) and
the Yellow-billed or Alpine Chough (C. gracula ), as it is more commonly
called. These wonderful birds were to be seen in mixed flocks per-
forming their aerial displays and calling high above our heads ;

higher up they were always to be seen feeding together on and around
the snow. The White-throated form of the Black-eared Wheatear
(Oenanthe hispanica ) and the Alpine Accentor (. Prunella collaris) were
encountered before we stopped to eat at the beginning of the Gavarnie
valley. While eating we had the good fortune to see a magnificent
Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) appear from the valley and circle with
the fabulous Cirque in the background. The rest of the day was spent
leisurely reaching the refuge in the centre of the valley, where we were
going to stay.
Having had my sleep disturbed by the refuge's rodent occupants,
I was up extra early the next morning, and at 6.20 a.m. one of my
companions spotted a single Lammergeier or Bearded Vulture
(Gypaetus barbatus grandis) circling high above the Port de Gavarnie
(7,510 feet). An idea of its terrific size could be got by the way it
dwarfed the Choughs, lower down, to pin-heads. Shortly afterwards
it appeared again from a gap in the rock-face opposite the refuge.
The combined effect of the early morning sun and the reflection off
the snow displayed to great advantage its rich orange breast and
underparts.
Later in the morning we made our way up towards the Port de
Gavarnie ; the air constantly being filled with the aerial call of the
Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta). We no longer met the Black Redstart,
so often seen flitting from stone to stone on the floor of the valley,
with a bill full of insects for its hungry family. We were unable to
reach the Port but managed to climb to a higher position, looking
across it, and into Spain. Seeing only a Kestrel after our hard climb,
we became rather dejected and began to prepare our mid-day meal.
Little did we know that we were about to reach the climax of our trip.
For before we could begin, not one or two, but three Lammergeiers
appeared below us heading for the Port. Led by an immature bird,
having a white head, but lacking the white markings on the back and
wings, which the adult that followed had. A little farther behind
came a young bird almost completely a uniform blackish-brown,
lacking the white head, and the same rhythm in its wing-beats as the
two leading birds.
This magnificent bird, found in the high mountain ranges of Southern
Europe, Africa, and Asia, has become known for its unusual habits.
Amongst them the practice of flying to a great height with a large
bone from a carcass, and dropping it on to the rocks below in an
attempt to break it and obtain the marrow.
Before we could settle down again, over our heads and into Spain
flew six Pallid Swifts (. Apus pallidus ), differing from the Common
Swift which we saw later over Gavarnie, in being slightly larger and
paler, and having a large white chin.
Other birds seen in the valley were Black-eared Wheatear, including

several youngsters, House Martin, Griffon Vulture, Snow Finch
(Montifringilla nivalis ) on two occasions, a young cock Rock Thrush
(Monticola saxatilis), mainly greyish with the rufous just appearing
on its breast. Adults were often heard, but never seen, although this
youngster and others seen were quite tame.
The Heas Valley was visited. Amongst the birds not found higher
up were a pair of Common Sandpipers, a pair of Rock Buntings
(.Emberiza cia), and a cock Blackcap. Taking insects to a nest in a hole
under a overhanging rock about io feet up and beside the road was a
Black Redstart. But a thick mist came down and blotted out further
study in the valley.
Hobby, Goshawk, a family of White Wagtails, and a Stonechat
were seen on the return journey to Lourdes.

By J. G. Suthard (Long Beach, California, U.S.A.)
Until a recent visit by Mr. George A. Allen, Jr., Editor of the
Gazette , I was not cognizant of the severity of the problem of soil
disinfection in aviaries. We had tried various chemicals for soil
disinfection and found the lime-sulfur method non-toxic and very
effective. At Mr. Allen's request I wrote a short article on my
experience with this method for the Gazette.
In this area we are confronted with infection from the common
Sparrow ( Passer domesticus ), from snails, slugs, and earthworms which
are hosts to numerous diseases. To combat infections of invertebrates,
virus, and bacteria, one must resort to one of two methods : (i) Make
the environment unsuitable for the pests or, (2) periodically treat the
soil with chemicals. The problem in chemical treatment of the soil
is that the chemicals which will destroy the wide range of pests are
toxic to the birds. Too, any such chemicals used for disinfection must
necessarily be short-lived otherwise their use would be dangerous to
the birds. One alternative to the two general methods is heat steriliza-
tion of the soil. The use of a torch is hazardous and the use of a steam
pan though effective is very cumbersome and expensive.
We have found that the lime-sulfur treatment of the soil as outlined
below is both a disinfectant non-toxic to vertebrates, and a deterrant
to micro-organisms, worms, snails, slugs, etc. The sulfur is also effective
against all kinds of mites.

Lime-sulfur Method of Treatment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956208" page_id="56315705"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
The application of the lime and sulfur is very simple. First, rake the
aviary ground free of debris. Eight pounds of slaked lime 1 and

four pounds of sulfur 1 are applied per hundred square feet. This
should be spread as evenly as possible and the soil turned by spading.
The area is made level by raking and two pounds of lime and two
pounds of sulfur used as top dressing. This should be raked into the
surface. The birds may be returned to the pen immediately. In the
case of very tame birds the operation may be performed without
removing them.
The above treatment of the soil should be adequate for six months.
Periodically lime may be dusted under the roosts and around the water-
pans or drippers to keep the soil from becoming sour. The sulfur is
slowly oxidized to sulfur dioxide which is a powerful disinfectant and,
in its elemental form, is a killer of mites of all kinds. We believe it is
complete protection against leg mites.
In badly-infected soils unslaked or dehydrated lime 2 may be used
as a heating agent as well as a disinfectant. To apply, trench the aviary
with furrows about 6 inches deep and 12 inches apart. Place in these
furrows unslaked lime (use gloves to handle), broken up into chunks
about 2 inches in diameter. Fill the trenches with soil to cover the
lime and soak the whole area with water. The heat generated by
the hydration of the lime will kill all forms of life in the soil. The
birds should not be returned to the aviary until it has completely
cooled.
Where the onset of an infection is rapid and severe the use of strong
chemical disinfectants may be necessary, so their use and the
precautions therefor are discussed here in some detail.
Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach)
Sodium hypochlorite is used generally in the form of 5 per cent
aqueous solution for household purposes. It is available as a 30 per
cent solution which is a strong oxidizing agent and should be diluted
to about 10 per cent solution with water before use.
To apply, spray the soil, posts, baseboards, and perches until
thoroughly wet. The birds should be removed from the pen before
spraying. Spade the soil and spray again with the sodium hypochlorite
solution and allow to stand for twenty-four hours.

This is an expensive chemical available in 3 per cent aqueous solution
or as a 30 per cent solution. The latter should be diluted carefully
(it will explode otherwise) by pouring the peroxide into water to

is the least expensive. It is commonly used in agriculture to supply sulfur to soils
deficient in this element.
2 Unslaked lime, GaO--unslaked or dehydrated lime is available in chunks as
taken from the kilns. It has a great affinity for water and this hydration generates
heat. Gloves should be used in handling to prevent burning of the skin.

make a 5 per cent solution. The aviary, if small, can be thoroughly
disinfected by spraying the ground, posts, wire, baseboards, and
perches with the solution. As the oxygen is dissipated rapidly the birds
can be returned shortly after the spraying is finished.
Chloride of Lime
This potent chemical can be used to disinfect the soil but has the
disadvantage that soil will have to be allowed to stand for several days
before re-use. The active agent, chlorine, is liberated slowly even when
the soil is wet. The chlorine gas, being heavy, must be diluted by
exposure to the air for a time.
Halogen Compounds (Compounds containing Chlorine, Bromine, or
Iodine)
Most of the halogen compounds are too toxic to be useful for soil
disinfection in aviaries. The use of a solution of potassium iodide--
iodine solution--has been sold for this purpose but as the iodine
sublimes at atmospheric temperatures, it presents a terrific corrosion
problem with any metal surface such as the wire, etc. It is a powerful
bactericide, but in addition to its corrosivity, is rather expensive
to use.
The use of antibiotic dust could be justified in small enclosures,
but again is very expensive.
The lime-sulfur treatment of the soil is the least expensive, least
toxic, and most effective of any chemical treatment I have tried.
Unfortunately the one type of infection which is difficult to guard
against is virus. The most common is fowl pox which appears to be air-
borne, but resides in the soil for long periods. The use of lime appears
to be effective in the destruction of this virus in the soil, particularly
if the soil is kept moist. It is believed that the effective action of the
lime is due to its alkalinity.
The lime sulfur method is consistent with some of the older methods
such as wood ashes of which the effective agent was sodium or potassium
carbonates and hydroxides.

DISPLAY FROM A CAPTIVE
COCK-OF-THE-ROCK
By C. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)

Since 1955 the Small Bird House at the London Zoo has housed an
Orange Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola rupicola). This lovely bird is
almost wholly orange, even to the intense orange iris of its eye and
although the flight feathers of the wings are black they are mostly
concealed by elongated, tapering, whispy fringes that spread outwards
from the edges of the feathers on the back, rump, upper tail-coverts,
and secondaries.
I had seen this bird, a solitary cock, a number of times, but always
crouching on the floor of its aviary enclosure in what appeared to be
a semi-moribund condition. I had assumed it was ill and was puzzled
that its condition seemed unchanged over a long period, but it was
not until I recently visited the house on a day when few visitors were
present and saw the bird perched in a normal posture, only to fly down
and crouch as soon as it saw me, that I realised that it was almost
constantly performing a display of some kind, directed at passers-by.
Very little is known of the behaviour and displays of these birds and
I have only found one short first-hand account of their display in an
article by W. Frost, in the Avicultural Magazine for 1910, where he
describes their behaviour in their natural haunts. The chance to
observe such behaviour is one of those unique opportunities that occur
in aviculture and the information is worth recording.
In the presence of a human being, seemingly of any age or sex, the
bird appears to pass into a trance-like state. This reaction is so
instantaneous and so consistant that it is difficult to see the bird in its
normal state, unless one can take it by surprise.
The bird's emotional state is most apparent from the appearance
of the crest. Fig. 1 shows the crest in its normal, relaxed position.
It arises on either side of the head in the region between the base of
the bill and the eye, and spreads out to form a flat double fan of
feathers which widens as it terminates on the crown of the head. The
crest is orange, with a narrow, chestnut subterminal band bordering it.
When the bird begins to respond to a person's presence the crest is
slowly expanded forwards and downwards, passing down on either side
of the bill until it reaches the feathers of the throat. At the same time
the head is tilted back a little and the large eyes gradually close to
mere slits.
This expanding of the crest and closing of the eyes appear to be
intimately linked. On one occasion I had the excited bird clinging
to the wire in front of my head, facing me, with crest closed and eyes
open. As I watched the crest began to expand and at the same moment

the eyelids began to close. This action was not complete, when the
eyes began to open again and the crest began to contract. This was
repeated several times, appearing to coincide with the onset and waning
of impulses of excitement in the bird and I was able to witness the
repeated incomplete spreading of the crest accompanied by partial
closing of the eyes, the two movements occurring as though there were
some mechanical link between them. In view of the position of the
crest in relation to the eye it seems possible that some muscular
relationship might exist. Fig. 2 shows a lateral view of the head with
the crest erected, the head lowered onto the shoulders with bill tilted
upwards and the eyes almost closed. This is the position adopted
during display and although I have indicated the position of the tip
of the bill, half-way up on the left-hand side of the crest, in life it is
invisible to the casual eye.
The bird may begin to show this posture when perched, but
invariably flies down to settle on the ground by the wire front of the
enclosure, near the observer. The head is drawn down on the shoulders
and the feathers of the neck and breast are fluffed out so that body and
head appear to be a single rounded mass, the only break in the outline
being the flat expanded crest which stands up above the body (Fig. 3).
The wings and tail are hidden by the mass of feather fringes which
sweep down like a trailing skirt at the back.
It crouches sideways on to the observer in a position which might be
due to the physical arrangement of its surroundings, but which appears
to be a deliberate lateral display. The head is always turned away
so that the posterior edge of the crest is presented towards the observer.
The crest is now fully spread and the eyes closed to mere slits. This
posture is shown in Fig. 4. There sometimes appears to be a slight
inflation of the neck and breast feathers, but otherwise the bird is

inquisitive finger produces no reaction, but the bird is concious and
watching. If the fingers of the hand are inserted through the wire and

pushed further and further forward in front of the bird, the head is
turned further and further away, so that the posterior edge of the crest
is always towards the foremost part of the fingers.
Although the bird normally crouches it may slowly rear itself up
while maintaining the display posture. This might be due to the
height and position of the observer and be an attempt by the bird to
align itself in relationship to him.

c. f. O. HARRISON---DISPLAY FROM A CAPTIVE COCK-OF-THE-ROCK IO 5
In this crouching posture the bird's appearance does not suggest
that of any normal creature. All that can be seen is a mass of fluffed
orange feathers, from one end of which rises a flattened crest at right-
angles to the main axis of the body. On the inner side of the crest, at
its base, is the narrow slit of an eye, and there is another in a similar
position on the outer side of it. There is no sign of a bill. One may
frequently see baffled visitors trying to discover a recognisable avian
structure within this mound of feathers. Normally the bird remains
silent, but I heard an occasional faint cluck from it while it is posturing.
Fig- 5 -
The bird may relax its posture, but when doing so maintains a
crouching posture, the top of the crest no higher than the back and
still expanded, and the eyes almost closed, as in Fig. 5. In this posture
it may perform exaggerated hops, springing one or two feet vertically
into the air and landing still crouching. If one moves to a new position
in front of the cage the bird quickly relaxes its posture and flies to
settle in front again. When doing so it may utter a loud squawking call
and may fly directly at the head of the observer, clinging to the wire
in front of him. There is a suggestion of aggressiveness in this behaviour.
Through the kindness of John Yealland, the Curator of Birds, I was
able to visit the door at the rear of the cage through which it can be
entered. I had hoped to see if the bird would react frontally to a person
if no barrier was present. I found, however, that the bird did not react
to the presence of a person at the door or inside the cage, but still
persisted in flying down to posture at the front of the cage.
The keeper informed me that it postured to him in the same manner
and was erratic in its behaviour, sometimes showing great tameness
and permitting handling, and at other times flying at him in the
apparently aggressive manner that I had observed when watching from
the front of the cage.
The bird had been purchased from a native in South America in
1955. A surprising variety of birds and animals are reared by some
native tribes and I suspect that this bird had been hand-reared and
had acquired a total fixation on human beings. This view is reinforced

by the knowledge that the cock had been put with a hen at an earlier
period, but had ignored her and continued to posture to passers-by.
So little is known that it is impossible to be sure whether the
behaviour described represents an aspect of the elaborate communal
display of this species, or whether it represents a response to another
individual which under natural conditions might be a rival or a mate.
There are elements of both aggressive and submissive responses in the
behaviour described.
Frost, in the article which I have already mentioned, described a
communal display in which one cock after another in rapid succession
would fly down from a branch to settle on the ground and immediately
turn and fly back to the perch, the whole forming a single rapid
movement. The ground at such a spot was swept bare by the wings
and tails of the displaying birds and the same spot was used repeatedly
on different days.
The apparent attachment to one part of the cage shown by the
captive cock and the fact that his behaviour resulted in this area being
swept clear of sand, might be related to the behaviour described, but
could be purely accidental.
If this behaviour is linked with the type of display-dance described
by Frost, then we have a combination of the erection of specialised
head-feathers and a display dance, or flight, between two points which
is very reminiscent of the displays described for the Mannakins
(Pipridae).

By Jean Delagour (Director (retired) Department of History, Science,
and Arts of the Los Angeles County, U.S.A.)
There has recently been a frightening outburst of bad taste in zoo
designing ; fantastically shaped and coloured houses, cages, and
aviaries have been erected here and there. Even worse ones are being
planned. I was saddened recently at seeing the ugly and inadequate
gibbon cage now being built at the London Zoo (on whose Council
I served for many years) and still more so by the project of an aviary--
a fussy, ridiculously shaped, " horned 55 horror which is not only in
bad taste, but impracticable and unsuitable. The principle of a
" walk-in " cage is excellent, and I can claim to be the sponsor of such
aviaries in America, where they have proved highly satisfactory. But
its very principle is that the cage itself is not obvious, so that the
visitor who is inside has as much as possible the illusion of walking
among free birds. The frame of the aviary must not only be simple and
inconspicuous, but also made invisible by trees and creepers. Even its
approach should be so planted on the outside that one is not aware that
there is a cage at all.
As to colours, it might be appropriate to reproduce here a note I was
recently asked to write for the Journal of the American Institute of Park
Executives (Parks and Recreations, January, 1961, p. 19) :--
" In museums and zoos alike the use of bright colours should be
made with extreme caution. A cardinal principle must never be
forgotten : the exhibit itself, dead or alive, is the only object which
should call the public's attention. Therefore, any flashy colours on
the frame, container, cage, or fence are to be avoided. Those fixtures
should be ignored or forgotten, and only discreet tones, which
harmonize well with the neighbouring media, are adequate. All kinds
of light fences and wire nettings are better painted black, a colour
which makes them almost invisible.
Exceptions can be made only in the case of special installations,
where an amusing and bright note is in order ; particularly in children's
zoos, and in facilities such as restaurants, souvenir shops, stands, etc.
There everyone's personal taste has a free range. It is essential, however,
that brightly coloured facilities be screened from the main animal
exhibits and do not compete with them. I favour, personally, some
restraint in any case. In museums and zoos we do not try to sell common
merchandise. Flashy colour schemes, which work well in purely
commercial premises are out of place in such institutions. We show
natural objects which have themselves a great attraction--they do not
require outside help to call the visitor's attention."

Birds in the Trust's collection have started the breeding season well.
At the time of writing eggs have been laid by many of the rarer
species of pheasants, including Temminck's Tragopan, Common
Koklass, Himalayan Monal, Elliot's and Mikado. The Common
Koklass laid seven eggs in her first clutch. This species has not been
successfully bred in this country before, although Mr. F. E. B. Johnson
succeeded in hatching chicks from his pair last year. Both the Trust's
Cabot's Tragopan hens have laid, although unfortunately one bird
had lost its mate a few days earlier.
Ten new permanent breeding pens, each measuring 20 by 9 yards,
have been completed recently. Each pen contains a wooden house,
purchased by the Director from the Leckford Pheasantries and
presented to the Trust.
Recent arrivals include some Rock Partridge ( Alectoris graeca) eggs
from Cyprus, a pair of Painted Spurfowl [Galloperdix lunulata), and
a number of Quail given to the Trust by Mr. R. D. Sane, one of
our members in Bombay ; a pair of Grey or Red-necked Francolin
(Pternistis afer swynnertoni) has been presented by Mr. Guthrie Hall,
Penalonga Pheasantries, Southern Rhodesia.
On Saturday, 15th April, the Director gave the premiere of his
film Wind in the Reeds , which is about the wildlife of the Norfolk
Broads, at the Royal Festival Hall in aid of the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund. An audience of nearly 3,000 resulted in several
hundred pounds being raised for the Cancer Fund. A copy of the
Ornamental Pheasant Trust's pamphlet was enclosed with every
programme, and at the end of the show the Director explained the
aims of the Trust and invited membership. Already a number of
new members have joined.
Many visitors have been to see the collection this spring, and
members are reminded that they are always welcome, but are
requested to write or telephone beforehand. Arrangements will then
be made to show them round.

One of the doyens of European aviculture, Monsieur Aime Decoux,
died in October, i960, at the age of 72 at his country home Gery,
at Aix-sur Vienne, near Limoges, France. Poor health and certain
financial difficulties had compelled him to reduce his collection of live
birds during the last two years, but until then he had kept some of
the best series of parrakeets, doves, and small birds ever assembled.
He had numerous aviaries and several bird rooms and many species
were raised in them during the last fifty years. He kept rare birds of
all kinds.
Monsieur Decoux was a scholar and wrote well in French, English,
and German. The Avicultural Magazine as well as French and
German journals contained many excellent studies of his birds A long
and close friendship was formed between him and the writer and he
was also a friend of our late Presidents, H. D. Astley and A. Ezra.
We all exchanged pleasant visits, enjoying one another's birds and
exchanging observations.
The passing of A. Decoux is a great loss to aviculture.
J. Delacour.

Two specimens of the Kori Bustard ( Choriotis kori struthiunculus) have
been presented by Mr. J. O. D'eath who found them at a game farm
in Tanganyika where they had been reared. This northern race had
never before been in the collection and it is many years since the
southern one, the Gom Paauw, as it is known in its native South
Africa, was here. The males are said to weigh between 20 and 30 lb.
and females only about 11 lb. It is a bird of the dry, open country
feeding on small reptiles, various invertebrate life, especially locusts,
vegetable matter such as seeds, and, it is said, small mammals. These
two birds certainly like mice better than anything else.
Other arrivals of particular interest are an Imperial Parrot (. Amazona
imperialis ), only found in the mountain forests of Dominica and now
very rare, and a Blue-eyed Cockatoo ( Kakatoe galerita ophthalmica) of

Tropical House. In this house there is a Pucheran's Emerald Humming
Bird that was received in April, 1957.
Three Great Eagle-Owls and two Spotted Eagle-Owls have been bred
in the Gardens. Spectacled Owls and Wood Owls nested, but the single
egg in each case was not fertile, so eggs of Snowy Owl have been sub-
stituted for them. Last year the Wood Owls hatched and reared a Snowy
Owl which, of course, soon became larger than its foster parents.

succeeded in trapping four Kakapos in the Tutoko Valley, Fiordland
National Park, South Island, New Zealand. The Minister of Internal
Affairs, Mr. Gotz, has taken great personal interest in the project,
which has been under the supervision of the Controller of Wildlife,
Mr. J. D. Pascoe, with Mr. M. M. Small in charge of the search
operations.
Every effort will be made to breed with these birds, which are in
extreme danger of extinction. They are being maintained at the
Mount Bruce Farm, Wairarapa, where Mr. Blwyn Welch has so
successfully cared for the four captive Takahes. The Kakapo
enclosure, which is both vermin and escape proof, is about 31 feet by
15 feet, and is divided into two so that the two pairs can be housed
separately. In each enclosure two substantial underground rock caves,
2 feet by 1 foot 6 inches in height, have been made to simulate the
holes under boulders where Kakapos spend the day in their natural
habitat. At first there was some concern because the birds had reacted
against the unavoidable handling, but they eventually settled down and
are now eating apples, tomatoes, oats, bracken fern, and drinking
honey in water.
We have just heard that one of the captive birds has died, but a
fifth has been caught and they all seem to be doing well.

Charles Everitt sends a little advance news of the Edward Marshall
Boehm aviaries. He writes : " Despite the late coming of spring, it is
still very chilly and windy out here, we have started our breedings for
1961. The Wood Swallows have got two chicks, five weeks earlier than
last year, and a Black-headed Sugarbird is on two eggs. We had another
pair of Hoopoes go to nest, but, as with the pair last year, the hen
died after having laid her third egg. This leaves us with but a solitary
male so, until we get some more, we can go no further with those.
I think we shall pull off some interesting ones this season, but it is too
early yet to make any conjectures on the subject. Anyway, we have
learned some rather useful things from our last year breedings. The
yellow ring round the eye of the Magpie Tanager shows up at 8J months
old : Also they are sexable by the size of the white spots on the wings
and the fact that the tail of the male is longer and broader than that of
the female--rather a fine difference to pick out in an individual bird
unless one has actually seen the variation. We have also detected a
distinct sex indicator in the Occipital Blue Pies. The females have an iris
of golden-yellow whereas that of the male is golden-brown. Further,
the thighs of the female are greyer than the male's and the tail-feathers
are not so long or as broad. These last two features would be hard to
use as a guide, but the iris of the eye is a sure guide. I have not seen
this recorded anywhere, so I thought it might be of interest."

CAGE BIRDS. By R. M. Logkley. Pan Books, Ltd. London, 1961.
Price 2s. 6 d.
This book sets out to give the would-be bird-keeper comprehensive
information as to how to go about his chosen hobby. There is a general
introduction to the subject, followed by chapters on Canaries and
Budgerigars and others in which all those species of foreign and
British birds that the author considers most suitable for cage or aviary
are briefly described, together with instructions as to their care in
confinement. It is illustrated with numerous sketches of varying quality
and four plates of photographs. One of these is titled " Chaffinch
Mule " but appears to be a normal hen Chaffinch without the least
sign of hybrid ancestry.
The book is, like the Curate's egg, quite good in parts.
The author makes some statements that are misleading and others
that are entirely incorrect. For example ; that mealworms and
gentles are an adequate alternative for wild insects (they certainly are
not for most birds that feed their young on live food). That doves
do not bathe in water but do bathe in dust (the reverse is true) and
that their crop-milk is " semi-digested pap " (it isn't). That the nest-
building of male weavers is "an occupational disease " and is com-
parable to the waltzing of waltzing mice (it is perfectly normal innate
behaviour in no way comparable to the pathological waltzing of mice).
We are told that bread and milk with beaten egg will serve as a sub-
stitute for insects for waxbills that are rearing young but not how
to induce the waxbills to eat this substitute. It is not difficult to
devise diets that are theoretically suitable for any particular bird,
getting the bird to co-operate is a different matter and one all too
often, as here, conveniently ignored by writers on bird feeding.
When it comes to general principles, however, the author's being
primarily a student of birds in the wild state has its advantages.
His advice on giving birds as much room as possible, allowing them
to bathe when they like, giving parrots plenty of company (human if
they are kept as house pets), and emphasising the dangers that may
result from ringing nestlings are sound and humane and should do
much to help beginners who read this book. Inevitably, however, the
impression is given that bird keeping is rather easier than it usually is,
at least so far as the keeping and breeding of most wild birds is
concerned.
Printers' devils have had a field day with the spelling, or rather
mis-spelling, of scientific names and on the vexed question of the
relationships of the finches, weavers, and estrildines the author appears
to disagree with most modern students of these groups. But these are
minor points and, from the point of view of the aviculturist, there is

at least something to be said for considering all small seed-shelling
birds as " finches 3 \
The author acknowledges the help he has received from the
secretary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and points
out that he is on the Council of that body. Perhaps, therefore, this
indicates that some leading bird protectionists now realise that it is
as justifiable for persons of modest means to keep and study such birds
as they can adequately care for as it is for some R.S.P.B. members to
keep wild waterfowl. If such is the case the publication of this book
is to be welcomed by all aviculturists, indeed by all fair-minded
people, for more than its intrinsic merits.

If Tawny Owls are killing the Partridges, the grass should be allowed to grow
long and Cotoneaster horizontalis should be planted, thereby giving more cover. The
ripe berries of Cotoneaster horizontalis are a favourite food of many birds.

SHOW CAGES OF BRITISH BIRDS AT THE NATIONAL SHOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971098583333333" page_id="56315719"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
Perhaps you might be interested in publishing in the correspondence pages of the
Avicultural Magazine the following comments on British Birds' Show Cages.
I would like to go on record as completely endorsing the sentiments expressed by
Mr. Derek Goodwin in the March/April number with regard to the British Hardbill
Show Cages.
As mentioned by Mr. Gregg in his letter these cage sizes are standardized by the
British Bird and Mule Club and I think I express the feelings of a very large number
of aviculturists when I say that it is high time that the above-mentioned Society
altered its rules and permitted British birds to be shown in a proper sized cage.
Mr. Gregg in his letter states that he thinks the cage sizes are quite right and he is, of
course, fully entitled to his opinions but if he has ever looked at the British section in a
show objectively, and as a whole, he will find that of all the sections this is the dullest
and dreariest part of what should be one of the most attractive sections of a show.
In my opinion his argument that there is the risk of a bird damaging itself in a larger
cage is entirely without foundation as foreign birds do not dash about and damage
themselves in much larger cages and neither would properly trained British birds.
Another thing which affects the appearance of this section is the dreary colouring
which, although presumably supposed to enhance the colour of the plumage of the
birds, in actual fact just makes that section look very dull.
Anybody who has been to the average Club Bird Show, or has had anything to do
with running a show, knows very well that in the average hall, all lighting is overhead
and by the time that dusk has fallen which is, of course, very early in the show season,
if one wishes to look at a British bird at all it is necessary to lift the cage out and tilt it
in order to examine the exhibit.

I submit that this is ridiculous and, as one does not have to do it in the case of a
Budgerigar, a Canary, or a foreign bird, why should it be necessary to show British
birds in such dull coloured cages when it must be well-known that the lighting in the
evening would be insufficient to show the birds up properly.
Also there is a very great deal of truth in Mr. Derek Goodwin's remarks about the
serious damage that showing birds in these small cages does to the British Bird Fancy.
In my experience a very large number of the ordinary visitors to shows are put off
by the unattractive showing of birds with which they are familiar. Indeed one is
often reduced to the level of having to give as much defence as one can possibly think
up to justify this method of showing. Mr. Gregg states that at the National Show there
is a special place where the casual visitor can find out the details as to how and why
birds are to be shown, but how many casual visitors at any show do so ?
I may say that I have kept and exhibited a fair number of British birds at local and
open shows and have also done a certain amount of judging, so I cannot be accused,
as Mr. Gregg hints, of being a " starry-eyed innocent " and I respectfully suggest
that the British show cage, which, in my opinion at any rate, is a relic of the bad old
days when bird shows were held in the back rooms of dubious public houses, should
be done away with.
Let us show our birds under proper, clean, and attractive conditions and in cages in
which the ordinary visitor to a show can see that the birds have room to turn round
and not in the tiny boxes which are now used.

Cyanops asiatica (Latham)
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
In the oriental regions of the world there are a large number of
wild fruit trees, which are very prolific in their yield. To the western
mind it is somewhat of a mystery how such multitudes of human
beings manage to starve, or to live in a state of semi-starvation, in
the midst of such reputed plenty. In many cases the answer to this
paradox lies in the fact that some degree of effort is required to
harvest and store this bounty.
The birds do not starve ; neither do they as a general rule lay up
any treasure upon earth. Moreover, they are frequently very wasteful
as is shown by the quantities of berries which are sampled and cast
to the ground with no more than a single bite taken. But then,
perhaps this is just their way of passing on some of the good things
of life to those below, who, less fortunate than themselves, are unable
to climb the trees, and are only too willing to partake of the fruit
thus provided. Mankind pontificates at great length upon subjects
such as this, as to whether there is any intelligence in a bird capable
of providing for the desires of others. I do not know.
It is a sight (worth the crick in the neck which one will certainly
get !) to see, or rather to try to see, the number of birds of widely
differing species which will gather in the vast canopy of a fruiting
ban-yan tree. There will be many more than you do see, and of
these several will betray their presence by sound or movement.
Half-eaten berries will fall, and following the general line of descent
back to the imagined point of origin one may learn of the presence
of a bird. It may be that noisy horror of the first dawn-light--the
Koel, which is a kind of cuckoo. It may be a clumsily clambering
parrakeet or a green fruit pigeon. It may be a barbet.
Barbets are common birds as a rule. There are species which prefer

I I 6 D. M. REID-HENRY-THE BLUE-THROATED BARBET
the hot and dry plains and there are those which are only met in
jungle country of a hilly or mountainous nature. It is said that they
do not come to ground and are entirely arboreal. This may well be
the case for they are not suited to life on terra firma. Their feet are
zygodactyl (two toes forward and two backward) and are strong
for grasping a perch or for clinging to the bark of a tree like a wood-
pecker, but they do not climb. Like the latter, they excavate a hole
in the wood of a tree and make such nest as they require at the end
of the tunnel where there is an enlarged nest-chamber. Frequently
the neatly rounded entrance hole is made upon the underside of a
branch, but whether this is a piece of avian drollery allied to
exhibitionism or whether it is a ruse to defeat the attentions of
would-be predators is not known. The bills of barbets are heavy and
powerful, and are surrounded by an outcrop of long and tapering
bristles. The size of the bill varies considerably in individuals of the
same species, and even from one season to another in the same bird !
I have noticed this is also the case in kingfishers, woodpeckers, and
several other birds which I have kept from time to time. Doubtless
this is due to the heavy usage which the bills of these birds are called
to withstand ; and I feel that measurements of bills of birds which
put them to hard work are of small use in connection with systematics
and the separation of one subspecies from another.
The food of nearly all barbets is fruit, with strong preference shown
for the various wild figs. Some species such as the Crimson-breasted
Barbet (Xantholama hamacephala ) may be said for all practical purposes
to be entirely frugivorous, whilst others, including the Blue-throated
Barbet, are ready to eat a more varied diet, including small lizards,
beetles, and other insects.
Generally speaking, the smaller the bird the more closely it sticks
to a fruit diet, but this does not apply to the African species of which
there are very many. These latter make inroads on the termite
population to a much greater degree than do the Asiatic birds, and
in some cases insects are the main item of food.
We come now to a point about which very much has been written
both in serious ornithological literature and in the more pregnant
style of soldiers' letters home. Nobody who ever had anything to do
with the tropics has failed to note and to comment upon the voices
of barbets ! As an indirect result of listening to their songs strong men
of sound mental balance have been reduced to a state of incoherent
and imbecile rage, whilst others have received medical treatment for
nervous disorders. Unlike the drooling noises with which we are more
and more assailed from the loudspeakers of our (and our neighbours')
radios, we cannot obtain rest by merely switching off! For the voices
of barbets are tireless and must, in the nature of the bird, be used.
As fast as one can be silenced, others take up the monotonous strain.

D. M. REID-HENRY-THE BLUE-THROATED BARBET I I 7
One would not mind except for the fact that it is mostly at that hour
when the heat of the afternoon is most intense and the habit of humans
is to retire for siesta, that the noise begins. The only escape I can
sincerely recommend is to learn to like it, but I will not offer advice
as to how this is to be done ; it is a matter for philosophy, and for
temperament.
The bird which is figured in the coloured plate is an inhabitant of
the trees growing upon the slopes of the Himalayan foothills from
the Punjab to Burma. Further east other races take its place. These
may be recognized by the encroachment of blue into the forehead
and crown. In one race the red is entirely replaced by blue.
This is one of the most frequently imported barbets, at any rate
into Britain, and is one which does well in a roomy cage, and fed
upon fruit and a reliable insectivorous mixture. Mealworms are
appreciated, and clean water a constant requirement. It often comes
over in a somewhat bedraggled condition, but the plumage will
improve considerably after a few sprayings with rainwater, and the
chance to preen in clean surroundings.
In size it is slightly larger than a Blackbird (Turdus merula ) but
there is a good deal of variation between individuals.
If housed in an aviary, care should be taken not to include weaker
birds with them because they are frequently very spiteful and broken
legs or worse will be the result, as I discovered when I first obtained
one of these barbets many years ago in Calcutta. It wrought con-
siderable damage to several small birds in the aviary before I discovered
who was the culprit. I did not ever see it deliberately chasing birds
because it knew well that they were more nimble on the wing than
it could be itself; but it would sit quietly amongst the foliage and
execute swift punishment upon any bulbul which chanced to alight
within reach of its large bill.
In the same aviary I had a pair of Coppersmiths or Crimson-
breasted Barbets which came into my hands one day. The two
species, despite the great disparity in size did not interfere with each
other, but I soon found that the Coppersmiths had to be moved
because they would partake too liberally of the " suttoo 55 which was
provided as a general item for birds such as bulbuls, thrushes, pittas,
Rosy Pastors, orioles, etc.
Suttoo is a powder, ground I believe from lentils, which is mixed
with water into a paste and can then be given the birds in lump
form, or rolled between the fingers into pills which can be swallowed
whole, and thus obviate the need for the bird to dig into the mess.
Without doubt it is a useful food, particularly for hand-rearing young
birds. It is very rich in protein, and for this reason it soon kills the
Coppersmith, who will cheerfully indulge itself to excess and thereby
execute its own death warrant.

Il8 B. P. DORMER-BREEDING THE BLACK-FACED CANARY
The matter of food for barbets brings my mind to the interesting
story told by Mr. Salim Ali, that well-known author of books on
Indian birds. He says that barbets are much disliked by coffee planters
in India because, " The birds swallow large quantities of the ripe
c cherries 5 and disperse the seeds (' berries ') far and wide. As these
are voided individually and not in bunches (as by monkeys and
jackals) it is not possible or worthwhile to collect them and they just
mean so much loss to the grower ".

(Serinus capistratus capistratus )
By B. P. Dormer (Luanshya, N. Rhodesia)
(I have received from Mr. B. P. Dormer, an aviculturist in Northern
Rhodesia, an account of the breeding in captivity of the Black-faced
Canary ( Serinus capistratus capistratus ). This breeding is of interest since,
according to C. W. Mackworth-Praed and C. H. B. Grant in their
work on the birds of Eastern and North-eastern Africa, the nest and
eggs of this species have never been described. It is therefore through
aviculture that we have been able to add to our knowledge of this
species.
The Black-faced Canary is a small bird, about the size of the
European Siskin ( Spinus spinus). The cock is bright yellow in colour
on the underside and much of the head. It has a black mask covering
part of the throat and forehead and extending back over the ear-
coverts. Mantle, nape, crown, and wing-coverts, are green with
blackish streaks, and the flight feathers of wings and tail are blackish,
with broad yellow edges. The hen lacks the black mask and the whole
of the head and the upper breast are green with fine dark streaks.
The species is distributed across central Africa, from the southern
Congo and northern Angola, to Northern Rhodesia and central and
southern Uganda. Several races are recognized. There appears to be
little known about its choice of habitat, although the eastern race,
S. c. koliensis, has been recorded breeding in a swamp.
C. J. O. Harrison.)
Some two years ago I obtained several pairs of the Black-faced
Canary from a friend in the Belgian Congo. A few of the " hens "
turned out to be cock birds in immature plumage. An accident
occurred which cost me a few of them when a section of the roof of the
aviary was lifted by the wind and they escaped. Eventually I finished
up with two true pairs and these were placed in a large garden aviary
in an attempt to breed them.

B. P. DORMER-BREEDING THE BLACK-FACED CANARY I Ig
Further misfortune dogged my efforts when this garden aviary had
to be demolished, due to an invasion of rats, so the first breeding season
was unsuccessful.
In March this year I built a small rat-proofed enclosure 16 ft. by
6 ft. by 6 ft. and in it liberated about thirty waxbills and finches,
together with the two pairs of Black-faced Canaries. Careful attention
was paid to feeding and wild grass seed both dry and fresh, was offered,
together with a staple diet of small panicum millet, termites, fresh
apple, and lettuce.
Before long the birds began to come into breeding condition and it
became necessary to remove one of the pairs of the canaries as they were
being persecuted by the other pair, who obviously wanted to nest.
A further fortnight was occupied in rather desultory nest-building,
and eventually a small nest, some two inches in internal diameter, was
completed in a bunch of heather tied up in the shelter of the aviary, the
hen doing most of the work with very little assistance from the cock.
It was composed of dry grass and fine rootlets, with a lining of very fine
grass, being rather flimsy in structure ; and I had fears that it would
not bear the weight of the brood. Four very pale slate-coloured eggs,
speckled with liver brown and more heavily marked at the larger end,
were laid. They were about the size of the eggs of the Green Singing
Finch (i Serinus mozambicus ). I was unable to measure them as I did not
wish to disturb the birds more than was necessary.
Incubation commenced two days after the laying of the last egg,
i.e. on nth April, and the first youngster appeared on 23rd April.
The hen did all the incubation and for some days she brooded the
youngsters very closely. On the 2nd May the parents were observed
taking termites, and from this time onwards the cock took an increasing
interest in his progeny.
On 6th May it was seen that the eyes of the youngsters were open
and they were almost full-feathered. Of the four eggs three had hatched,
one disappeared, and one of the youngsters died at the age of four
days. The cock was now feeding the youngsters with gusto and on
12th May they left the nest. Examination of the nest showed that it
had been fouled by the young.
Rearing was mainly done on lettuce and apple which were supplied
once a day, in the morning. Termites were taken, but in relatively
small quantities ; in fact I feel sure that these birds could be reared
without live food. The apple and the lettuce, I would say, were
essential.
On 28th May the two surviving young were independent. In colour
the youngsters resembled the hen but were, of course, paler and less
distinctly marked. They would appear to be a pair since one is
definitely greyer in tone on the breast and belly.
One thing I noticed which appeared to be strange was that at no

time during the courtship was there any enthusiastic displaying by the
male bird. It is possible, of course, that I did not observe the actual
nuptial display although mating was seen to occur on two or three
occasions. I will obviously have to pay more attention to this aspect
if the pair decides to have a second brood, which already appears
likely. Should this second brood materialize I shall attempt to measure
the eggs and photograph them in colour.

By F. Meaden (Slough, Bucks., England)
The article, " Honey Bee Larvae (Apis mellifera) for Bird Food 5 5
by Norman E. Gary, Robert W. Ficken, and Robert C. Stein in
January-February issue of the Avicultural Magazine has prompted
these notes of mine on natural food for softbills. I am extremely
interested in avian dietetics but keep, breed, and study the avi-fauna
of northern Europe. However, the insects which we breed for our
insectivorous collection will serve equally for most exotic species from
further afield and I hope that the information given may prove useful
to those wishing to experiment. Our softbill collection at the moment
consists of Redstarts, Stonechats, Wagtails, Goldcrests, etc.; our
Nuthatches, Buntings, Waxwings, and Rock-Thrushes also take their
share of the numerous insects we offer and even the hardbills proper
are not slow in accepting these tit-bits whenever available, although
for the latter we always have regular supplies of gentles.
I am no entomologist so my miniature insectary has a very limited
range ; our insect culturing covers merely three species of moth, two
of beetles, and, of course, the loyal old standby--the fruit fly. The
insectary is a cupboard approximately a yard square by just a little over
twelve inches deep and is situated in the birdroom, immediately above
the tubular heaters. We find that by having a thermostat fitted inside
the cupboard and set at 75 0 F. that the room itself is seldom over 50* F.,
even with the heaters on. We prefer that the heat should never be above
this temperature in the winter as the Goldcrests have the freedom of the
room during the cold months and too much heat softens them to such
an extent that to attempt breeding from them in the open flights in
early spring would be useless.
All the insects written of here can be cultured in 7 lb. confectionary
jars or goldfish bowls kept at a steady 25*C. (77 0 F.) and relative
humidity of 70 per cent, preferably in a dark position ; each container
should hold one pound of the appropriate food for the species of
insect being bred. To facilitate simple pupating there should also
be present three or four long one-inch wide strips of corrugated

packing paper rolled into three-inch diameter rolls, and secured with
pins or elastic bands ; a six-inch long test-tube of water will prove an
ideal drinker if a strip of blotting paper in the tube protrudes half-an-
inch past the cork or stopper. For sub-culturing the moths, prepare the
containers as above ; each should contain twenty-five to thirty full-
grown moths. If conditions are suitable, breeding will commence almost
immediately and with new jars started at various intervals a continuous
supply can be maintained throughout the year. It is a simple matter to
transfer the moths, their larvae, and pupae from such containers to
the birds. A handful of the contents from the culturing jars will give
a good day's supply of insects in their varying stages to any pair of
small softbills, and, being enclosed in a lump of the food matter, they
will in all probability last the whole day and not be eaten in one large
feed as would ant pupae, caterpillars, etc. I must make it clear here that
I do not attempt to feed our stock solely upon these insects as the normal
basic diet is ever present in as wide a variety as can be given. However,
there is no doubt that a continuous supply is appreciated; any movement
to the insectary door invariably brings many shining black eyes in that
direction. The Goldcrests which are loose in the room help themselves
whilst the insectary door is open, the caged specimens (during winter
only) proceed to the nearest corner and await their turn.
Ephistia cautella is a very fast reproducing moth that requires little care,
the larvae and pupae, needless to say, will also be taken by the birds.
The food for this species consists of wheatfeed and glycerine in the
proportion of five to one by weight. Considering that each female lays
up to 200 eggs over a seven-day period whilst their life cycle is approxi-
mately forty-five days at the recommended temperature and conditions,
it will be seen that they can prove a useful bird-food supplement.
Anagasta kiihmella. The Mediterranean Flour Moth is similar in
appearance to the former. Once again we have here a plump creature,
soft of skin, which in larval form resembles the caterpillars to be found
hanging from the oak trees in summer.
The feeding will give even less trouble since only wheatmeal is given
and as they multiply as readily as the above species, little difficulty
will be encountered providing one remembers their necessities in life ;
fifty to fifty-five days is the life cycle in this case.
Achroia grisella. The Lesser Wax Moth is my own favourite as a bird
food ; the moth seems to be even more fleshy and moist and the larva
is noticeably larger, yet is freely taken by such mites as the Goldcrest.
Although the food for this moth entails a little more work to mix, I
honestly believe the time well spent since such food, nourishing in
itself, must surely instil into the moth a high protein content most
valuable to our birds. Their food is a mixture of wheatmeal, rolled oats,
glycerine, and honey in the ratio of 6 : 6 : i : i ; I find the simplest
method is to mix a cupful of each, honey and glycerine, in a large bowl

and then both of the cereals (six cups of each), the resulting mixture
should be crumbly, but of a gluey nature.
Carpophilus dimidiatus. The Gom-sap Beetle, barely any longer than
a sixteenth of an inch, with the larva about three times this length,
despite its small size is still a welcome addition. They are rarely missed
by the birds when a handful of the culturing jar contents is placed in
front of them in a shallow feeding vessel. Our Redstarts in particular
seem to enjoy turning over the oatmeal on which the beetles are fed,
not ceasing until the last one has disappeared ; being small I suppose
the food content is correspondingly low but, even so, the variety of diet
is beneficial.
Tribolium casteneum. The rust-red Flour Beetle belonging to the
family Tenebrionidae is a relative of the Tenebrio molior, our old friend
and foe the mealworm. It is the commonest pest of stored goods,
being found on cereals and their products, oilseeds, bones, and
in particular oriental dry foods. To breed this insect in large quantities
the ideal mixture consists of half each rolled oats and wheatmeal.
Under identical conditions to those advised for the moths, etc., they
will multiply rapidly. The length of the beetle is approximately an
eighth of an inch, it is of a lighter colour than the Com-sap Beetle and
is easily distinguished from it. The larva is like a miniature mealworm,
roughly a quarter of an inch in length, and is a great attraction to our
birds, but being a relative of the mealworm I sometimes wonder if they
could prove over fattening.
With all insect culturing beware of excess moisture and the fermenta-
tion of the food or mites and psocids will cause havoc in the culturing
containers. These pests will not worry birds of course, but can be
a nuisance when serious breeding of these valuable live foods is
undertaken.

(Saxicoloides fulicata)
By Mrs. M. Williams (Cobham, Surrey, England)
I have only kept birds since October, i960, and this is my very first
attempt at breeding, by accident rather than design. Being so
inexperienced I decided upon a bachelor aviary. This consists of
a bird-house and an outside flight 14 by 8 feet by 6 feet high and
contains about twenty birds : Weavers, Whydahs, Fruitsucker,
Pekin Robins, Shama, Scarlet Tanager, Indigo Buntings, Verditer
Flycatcher, and Saffron Finch.
The hen Indian Robin was purchased from Bleak Hall Bird Farm
as a supposed cock, but when I saw some cock birds at another dealer
I realized I had a hen ; so I bought a cock and immediately I put
him in the aviary he started displaying to the hen, but she would not
have anything to do with him.
I had noticed that the hen did not care about roosting on perches
but she tried to roost on a narrow sill at night, so I nailed a cardboard
bird-carrying box (single bird size) to the outside top corner of the
bird-house in the outside flight for her to roost in at night. Less than
two weeks after the cock was put in the aviary I noticed the hen
flying to the box with grass, obviously building a nest ; no nesting
material was supplied. She completed a nest of dried grass and moss
in the box and laid four eggs about 14th and 15th May. The eggs
were oval, whitish-blue, speckled and blotched light brown. Incubation
was mostly by the hen but the cock inspected and sat in the opening
of the box whenever the hen left the nest for brief periods. After
thirteen days, on 28th May two young hatched. The feeding was
carried out by both parents and this consisted entirely of live ant eggs
for the first few days, then cleaned gentles and mealworms (strictly
rationed), but mostly live ant eggs were eaten.
On 7th June at ten days old the two young left the nest, one about
two hours after the first. They are now thirty-one days old and
independent. They were fully feathered with greyish-brown breasts,
brown wings, russet rump, and dark brown upright tails.
The young are still with their parents (27th June) and still roost at
night in the same box.
The hen laid again but deserted after two eggs had been laid.
As described above, Mrs. M. Williams has bred the Indian Robin,
Saxicoloides fulicata. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to com-
municate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

By K. E. L. Simmons (Woodley, Reading, England)
During the course of a recent study on problems of anting in birds,
now more or less completed, I recorded anting in over 200 individual
birds of ninety-six passerine species : eighty-eight species in captivity,
five species (the Common Starling, Blackbird, Song-Thrush, Rook, and
Common Jay) both in captivity and in the wild, and three species
(the Robin, Blue Tit, and Chaffinch) in the wild only. No non-
passerine, of numerous species observed, showed any sign at all of
anting-behaviour.
Fig. 1.--Magpie-Robin {Copsychus saularis) Anting.
This species, like the majority of passerines observed anting, applies the ant with the
bill directly to the under surface of the primary-tips (one wing at a time). The tail is
postured to press against the wing in order to steady it for the anointing but is not
itself usually treated (as was once thought).
(Sketch by Robert Gillmor.)
Of the birds watched in captivity, all anted under experimental
conditions with worker-ants deposited in cages or flights and, in the
case of tamer birds, with ants accepted from my fingers. The main
species of ant used in these tests was Formica rufa (Wood Ant), a member
of the formic-acid producing Formicinae. Some birds also anted with
other ants of this group : F. sanguinea (Robber Ant), F.fusca (Slave

K. E. L. SIMMONS-RECORDS OF ANTING IN PASSERINE BIRDS 1 25
In general, stinging ants are not used for anting and most of the few
tests with these produced negative results. However, three very tame
birds (a Hill Myna, Blue-winged Siva, and Yellow-backed (Brazilian)
Hangnest) which were expecting Formicine ants from my fingers did
ant with one or both of two species of Myrmicine ants : Monomorium
pharaonis (Pharaoh's Ant) and Myrmica ruhra (Red Ant).
Of the wild birds observed, Starlings, Blackbirds, Song-Thrushes, a
Robin, a Jay, and a Blue Tit anted with Wood Ants deposited by me.
Three Blackbirds, another Robin, and three Starlings were seen anting
in natural conditions with Garden Ants. A Jay, a Rook, and a Black-
bird, earlier in the study, were also seen anting with unidentified ants
(probably the small yellow Hill Ants in the case of the Jay).
Fig. 2.--Grey Thrush (Turdus cardis) Anting.
A few species, principally the thrushes and crows, but also some small passerines such
as the estrildine-finches, ant indirectly by assuming special postures to allow the ants
to crawl on to their plumage. Most of the species which ant thus also apply ants
directly with the bill, often at the same time, but the Grey Thrush (and a few other
birds) usually go through the motions only of so doing, without actually picking
up the ants.
(Sketch by Robert Gillmor.)
The topic of anting in birds has attracted considerable attention in
recent years and a very large literature has grown up around it. In spite
of this, however, there is practically no universal agreement on any
of the major anting problems. There is not even agreement on
what actually constitutes anting. One can read widely differing
opinions and interpretations by recent authors, for example Poulsen
( 1 956), Goodwin (1956), Simmons (1957), Whitaker (1957), Chisholm
( J 959 )&gt; an d Burton (1959). For a useful introduction to anting the

reader is referred, however, to a paper by Goodwin (1955) in these
pages.
The purpose of the present note is to give, in convenient form, a list
of the birds seen anting during my study over the years 1952 to 1961
and also of some other recent records (published and unpublished)
which are additional to those in the latest list of anting species
(Whitaker, 1957). A full account of my own work is in active
preparation and brief reports on some aspects have already appeared
(Simmons, 1958, 1959, and i960).
The majority of the birds listed below were seen anting at the London
Zoo. I am greatly indebted to Mr. J. J. Yealland (Curator of Birds)
for giving me facilities for this work and for the help and interest shown
by him and his staff. Further acknowledgements will be made
elsewhere.
Of the ninety-six species forty-nine had not previously been
recorded as anting. Also three additional families were added to the
anting list. All these new records are indicated by heavy type.

or even more, than over-splitting. On the other hand, it must be admitted that certain
groups (e.g., the tanagers) are artificial ones but they are kept for convenience.

Aviculturists are in an especially favourable position to make
observations on anting, particularly in rare or otherwise inaccessible
species. All types of information are needed, however, and I would
encourage observers to publish their experiences. I would be most
interested to receive any records of true anting (with ants) by passerines.

I would also appreciate notice of any overlooked references to anting
in the avicultural literature, especially in Cage Birds and in the older
volumes of the Avicultural Magazine. Instances of anting may well
be hidden away in general articles ; for instance, I was browsing
through some odd numbers of our magazine lately and came across
an undoubted reference to anting by the Pekin Robin in an article by
Butler (1913).

LAUGHING JACKASS (.Dacelo gigas )
ARTIFICIALLY IN THE BASLE ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996779475" page_id="56315749"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
By Dr. Hans Wackernagel (Basle Zoological Gardens, Switzerland)
Since 29th May, 1953, two Kookaburras have made their home
with us in the Basle Zoo. The birds, which were from the outset
assumed to represent a pair, occupy a roomy aviary inside the bird
house with direct access to a flight cage out of doors, the latter being
some twice the size of the former. Kookaburras are perfectly suited
to our climate and our birds make full use of the outdoor cage in
summer and winter alike. Sharing quarters with them are a Victoria
Crowned Pigeon, a pair of Ringed Teal, a pair of Black-tailed Water-
hens from Australia, a pair of Bleeding-heart Pigeons, and a pair of
Red-vented Bulbuls. We give the Kookaburras a mixed feed that is
fed to all the cage birds in the zoo, supplemented by freshly killed
white mice.
In a corner of the indoor aviary we fashioned, with the help of a
few boards, a hollow some 20 cm. high and 30 cm. deep underneath
a mound composed of peat and sand. The whole floor is otherwise
covered with a 10 cm. deep layer of this peat and sand mixture. At
the entrance the hollow measures some 20 cm. across and widens
slightly towards the back.
In 1959 our Kookaburras made their first breeding attempt. On
26th April an egg lay in the hollow, but by the next day it had been
broken. A further two broken eggs were found on 1st and 4th May
respectively. There had not been any nesting material carried into
the hollow, the floor of which, just as the aviary floor, consisted of
peat and sand.
The pair showed no further interest in the nesting place until
April, i960. On 29th of that month we observed the first egg, and
on 2nd May there was a clutch comprising two eggs. This time the
birds began to sit in earnest. Then, on 25th May, i960, the keeper
observed one of the parent birds flying up on to a branch in the
aviary, carrying in its beak a newly hatched chick. Several times it
struck its victim against the branch, after which it proceeded to
devour it. In the light of this behaviour the second, still intact egg
was removed without delay to an incubator. The young Kookaburra
hatched early in the morning of 26th May. We were thus able to
establish an incubation period of twenty-four to twenty-six days. For
the first day we left the chick in our large motor incubator in a
temperature of about 37 0 C. On the second day it was removed to
a smaller incubator the temperature of which we first set at 30* C.,
reducing it later to 27 0 C. The young bird lay in a small cardboard

box lined with hay which was in turn covered with a paper hand-
kerchief which could be changed as required. We kept the nest,
together with its tiny occupant, slightly moist by spraying it lightly
with water now and then.
Naturally we were not unduly optimistic about raising this helpless
nidicolous bird. We were well aware that similar attempts with birds
of this type had seldom before met with success. But fortunately,
from the beginning, the youngster gave every appearance of being
normal and healthy. At first we fed it every half-hour with a two
hour's break at midday during the day, and once at night between
io and 12 o'clock. The food was offered with a pair of tweezers. As
On the third day, 28th May, i960, when we began keeping check, our Kookaburra
weighed 26 grams. It grew very rapidly and by the twenty-seventh day had
attained a maximum weight of 320 grams. By the time he was ready to fly his weight
had fallen to 225 grams. This so-called post-embryonic superweight is typical of
nidicolous birds (Portmann, 1955) and is put down to a vigorous development of
the intestine and liver during the most intensive period of growth.
a rule the Kookaburra would eagerly snap at the food the moment
it touched its beak. Sometimes, however, it needed encouraging,
which involved opening its beak very carefully. During the first three
days of its life we fed it on the entrails of white mice--heart, liver,
kidney, stomach, and some ant eggs. Immediately before the food
was given we dipped it in Ringer solution, containing a solution of
pepsin and hydrochloric acid (ten drops to a dl.) to alleviate the
digestive processes and to avoid a too heavy loss of fluid. In addition,
it received one to two drops of our humming bird food with each feed,

and one drop of " Protovit liquid " (Roche) daily. From the fourth
day on we added to its diet haunches of mice, the bones of which had
previously been crushed with a hammer, and crickets of our own
breeding. As a result our young protege every now and then disgorged
pellets. These were seen to contain the remains of chitin and bones.
The excrements were, in view of the diet, constantly fairly moist and
consisted of white uric acid and a dark coloured solid matter. From
the sixth day on we gave only hourly feeds and added to the meals
tiny balls of our mixed feed for cage birds, and small pieces of fish.
To our delight the small bird developed steadily without causing
us any particular anxiety--our greatest concern was not to give it too
much food at once. The accompanying photographs and weight table
will show at a glance the various stages in its development. Our
observations concerning its growth were found to agree with those
made on another bird of the same species which had been raised by
its parents in the Wassenaar Zoo. A detailed description of the
development of this particular bird was published in this Journal by
H. A. Gerrits (1958). The comparison shows that a perfectly natural
development can be achieved under artificial conditions provided
sufficient care is exercised. At first our Kookaburra was completely
naked, his whole appearance being dominated by the huge belly with
the intensively working digestive organs. The first pin-feathers began
to show on the wings only on the ninth day. On the fourteenth day
the eyelids gradually opened and powerful quills appeared. The
feathers now began growing rapidly, and we could remove our young
charge from the incubator to a small box lined with peat and hay,
placed on an electrically-heated board. The bottom of the nest was
kept at a temperature first of approximately 30* G. then later at
approximately 25 0 G. On the twenty-fourth day the quills began to
unfold. At length, although the eyes had been open for some time
already, we observed a certain reaction to optical stimuli. When a
hand was passed over the box the bird cowered down into the recesses
of its nest, and on the thirtieth day we noticed it looking after the
flies buzzing overhead. The lenses, however, were still clouded. Our
Kookaburra had now become strong enough to do without the
two late evening feeds. It received two drops of " Protovit liquid 55
(Roche) daily while the pepsin-hydrochloric acid solution was
dispensed with. On the twenty-seventh day it had reached its
maximum weight and its appetite fell off markedly. Hereafter we

day the bird seemed ready to fly and it was put into a cage, where
on the following day it took up its position on a branch. For the
first time also its characteristic laugh could be heard. On the forty-
eighth day it ate independently ; unabashed, it seized whole mice in
its beak, striking them after the fashion of the parent birds against a

branch or on the ground before devouring them. On the forty-ninth
day we introduced it to the Press, on which august occasion it
suddenly lifted its wings and made an impressive flight all round the
bird house. In eighty-two days it graduated to an outdoor cage. At
first we put it there only during the daytime ; soon, however, it was
left outside at night too, and finally it accepted it as its quarters
throughout the whole winter. To-day it never fails to delight us with
its excellent health and tame nature.
There only remains to be said that the parents nested again in
June, i960, and laid two eggs. The young ones hatched on 15th July
and were this time reared irreproachably by the parent birds. They
left the nest on 18th and 20th August at the ages of thirty-four and
thirty-six days respectively. While they were rearing their young we
gave the parent birds, in addition to their normal feed, mice cut up
in four or five parts. Each of these parts was enriched with a drop of

NESTING OF THE SPLENDID PIGEON
(Columba speciosa)
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
In December, of 1957, while still residing at my old home on
Woodman Avenue in Sherman Oaks, I had occasion to import five
</table>

specimens of the very handsome, large Splendid Pigeon, which the
exporter called Scalloped-neck Pigeon. It is a forest dweller, mainly
arboreal, and hails from South and Central America. After moving
the pigeons to my new home in Encino in January of 1958, I let a
fellow-fancier select what proved to be a true pair, placing the
remaining three birds in a roomy pen by themselves.
These beautiful, red-billed pigeons were very shy for many months,
even though kept in a solidly-covered pen, where they were well-
protected from the usual nocturnal marauders, such as owls, cats,
opossums, and the like. During the day they were wont to perch high,
descending to the floor of the pen only when in search of food and
drink. All three pigeons were, and are to this day, amiable--there

has never been any fighting among them, which, to say the least, is
noteworthy since almost all other species of pigeons, especially
breeding pairs, will when nesting become aggressive--naturally so in
defence of their breeding territories.
During 1958, 1959, and i960, the Splendid Pigeons made no attempt
whatever at nesting. In point of fact, I did not know whether or not
there was a true pair among the three, for I have never heard any
cooing, nor have I seen any mating or nest-building activities. This
despite the fact that I have had these newcomers under almost continual
observation ever since I was so fortunate as to obtain them. Never in
all my dove and pigeon-keeping experience, extending over more than
thirty years, have wild, imported pigeons taken more than three years
to " let me know " that they were capable of breeding. I thought all
along that I had three hens, particularly since these pigeons were so
very inactive in their behaviour, and also almost " voiceless". I might
add here that the pair sold to a fellow-fancier has behaved similarly and
has made no attempt at nesting thus far.
Four weeks ago I was agreeably surprised to see one of the Splendid
Pigeons sitting in a nest-box, five feet off the ground, which I had filled
with dry grass-cuttings. Since incubation continued also during the
night, I began to suspect that there might be a true pair among the
three birds, for among pigeons it is the rule for the male to incubate
from about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the hen taking over during the remaining
time. Moreover, it is rare for a hen pigeon to incubate also during the
day-time, even though such cases have occurred. Owing to the shyness
of the Splendid Pigeons, I was very careful not to disturb them in any
way or even to approach within three feet of their nest. When, after
about twenty days, the nest was left permanently, I found two white
eggs in it, the size of domestic pigeon eggs, both being infertile. Not
having bred this species before, I do not know whether it lays only one
egg at each setting or two eggs. If only one egg, then it may be that
two hens laid in the nest, their first since importation in 1957 ! (Jean
Delacour, who calls this magnificent pigeon the " Fair Pigeon " does
not mention any egg-laying habit of this species in his informative
" Wild Pigeons and Doves.")
I should add that there is hardly any difference in the coloring of the
three birds, one of them showing a somewhat richer maroon on the
wings and a more greyish-white on the neck. As to size, all three pigeon
are the same.
Some weeks ago the pigeons sat again in the same nest--day and
night. Six of seven days ago, two of them began to sit side by side
in the nest--a fairly sure, though by no means conclusive, sign of their
having hatched young. To-day (14th May, 1961) there was no pigeon
on the nest ; so I examined it and to my surprise found a week-old
squab in it, but dead. Covered with dark-blue fuzz, the squab, which

had a full crop, seemed strong and healthy. I am at a loss to know
why it died. At any rate, the secret is finally out--I do have a true pair
of Splendid Pigeons among my three birds, of which fact I am very
glad, for to the best of my knowledge, there has been no nesting of
Columba speciosa in this country ; and I should be grateful to any
member of our Society for information of a previous successful nesting
or raising of this splendid bird. In 1943, I was in possession of a single
Splendid Pigeon, which happened to be part of an importation from
Central America. Professor Gifford of Oakland, who was then a very
active and ardent dove-breeder and who had never kept this species,
asked me for it and got it. He was, however, unable to obtain a mate
for this pigeon.
Incidentally, since I found but one squab in the nest and nothing
else, it may be assumed that the Splendid Pigeon, like many of the
larger Columbidae, lays but one egg at a sitting. These pigeons are fond
of whole corn (maize) and also of small squares of longhorn cheese.
Mealworms do not seem to be to their liking. At this writing, the
breeding season is still young ; it is quite likely, therefore, that there
will be further attempts at nesting by these pigeons, some of which,
I trust, may be successful.

2nd November, 1903, to 29th May, 1961
Edward Nevill Tempest Vane, known throughout the avicultural
world as " Ted ", was undoubtedly a very great authority on the
keeping and breeding of psittacines. His interest in these birds was
life-long and he must at one time or another have owned almost as
many species as anyone within living memory. Since the last war he
had built up a large and representative collection and the number of
species bred annually testify to his skill in that direction. His favourite
group was perhaps the Grass Parrakeets, but actually he had no
particular favourites, anything parrot-like was of absorbing interest
to him. Hybrids he did not much care about but the breeding of
mutations greatly appealed to him and his success with lutino Nyasa
Lovebirds and blue Ring-necked Parrakeets is well known to all
interested in the production of colour varieties. He was awarded
four of the Society's medals for first breedings : Bauer's Parrakeet,

A great advocate for the absolute necessity of building up and
maintaining breeding stocks of the rarer parrakeets, he was ever
helpful with advice as to how this could best be done.
Vane was elected a member of the Society in 1937, served for two
terms on the Council, and was one of the Society's representatives on
the Executive Committee of the National Council of Aviculture. He
was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Aviculturists' Club since
its foundation in 1946, and rare indeed were the occasions that he
failed to attend a meeting. He was also closely connected with the
Foreign Bird League and had been President for the past ten years.
His writings in the Avicultural Magazine, Foreign Birds , and Cage
and Aviary Birds were numerous and on a wide variety of subjects,
but, let it be said, he never rushed into print, and his articles were
invariably informative or instructive. His Guide to Lovebirds and
Parrotlets was published in 1959, and enjoyed an immediate popularity.
The last years of his life were marred by illness and he was denied
the pleasure of looking after his birds himself. It was essential that
he should conserve his physical energy and in no way over-tire himself,,
so he decided to devote his time to writing a monograph of the great
family of parrots. It was his intention to cover the near eight hundred
forms illustrated by his own paintings, for early in his enforced
inactivity he had discovered that he was possessed of considerable
artistic ability. This monumental undertaking is about two-thirds
finished and it is to be sincerely hoped that some way may be found
to complete it so that it may eventually be published. It would
indeed be tragic if so much research and skilful compilation were to
be wasted.
He was also a skilled photographer and had built up an extensive
library of photographs of birds.
In his passing British aviculture has lost a great and well-informed
enthusiast and the Society and Club a staunch supporter. His many
friends have suffered a loss which is too great adequately to express.

There has been a long and interesting list of new arrivals of which
four species have not previously been exhibited in Regent's Park.
These are the Lesser Flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor ), the Montezuma
Oropendola (Gymnostinops montezuma), the Rufous Laughing Thrush
(Garrulax or Dryonastes poecilorhyncha berthemyi), and the Black-eared
Wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica hispanica ).
The Lesser Flamingo inhabits certain areas of Africa, Madagascar,
and north-western India, sometimes living in vast flocks. In recent
years much has been discovered and published about the life of this
formerly little known bird.
The Montezuma Oropendola inhabits forested parts of Central
America, living in colonies. The nests, sometimes very many together,
are suspended from the branches of trees. They are sleeve-like
structures as much as 6 feet in length with an opening near the top.
The Rufous Laughing Thrush is written of by La Touche [Birds of
Eastern China) who says " This beautiful bird has, so far, only been
found in the higher mountains of North-West Fohkien (Fuhkien).
It is a forest bird, and very little seems to be known of its habits.
It has a very beautiful voice, and should be an extremely interesting
aviary-bird ". It is now known also to live in Szechuan. There is
another race in Formosa and one in northern Yunnan.
The Black-eared Wheatear is one of those collected in Spain during
i960 by Mr. M. D. England who hand-reared a nest of them.
A Stripe-breasted Star-throated Humming Bird (Heliomaster
squamosus) and three Ruby and Topaz (Ruby-crested) are among new
additions to the Tropical House. Two Ostriches, a Bronze-tailed
Peacock Pheasant (Polyplectron chalcurum), three Scintillating Copper
Pheasants, six Auriculated or Violet-eared Doves, two Galapagos
Doves, a Jobi Island Dove, and three Lemon Doves have also been
received. I was interested to see this last species which Mr. Prestwich
bred for the first time in this country, for Durrell and I brought one
of the other species (.Aplopelia simplex) from the Cameroons in 1948
and this specimen lived in Capt. Clarence's aviaries for some time.
Mr. Spence has, I believe, some in his collection now.
Two Hammerkops [Scopus umbretta), three North American Turkeys,
a female Kori Bustard, and two Javan Parrakeets [Psittacula a.
alexandri) are also noteworthy additions. Two Black-footed Penguins,
a Gannet, two Cormorants, and three Turquoisine Parrakeets are
among those bred in the Gardens.

previously had both disappeared--as last year. I searched the bottom

According to the Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland
i960 was not a good breeding year for the penguin colony : " the
reasons suspected being ( a ) lack of ungutted fish which reduced the
vitamin content of the feeding, and (b) unsettling the resident birds
by introducing the 1959 contingent of kings, gentoos, and maccaronis
which had been undergoing a year's acclimatisation in another
enclosure. As the Society has been fortunate in again procuring
ungutted fish, and as new and old birds are now happily united, the
coming summer should bring a satisfactory number of chicks to the
penguin enclosure."
The Night Heron colony continues to increase in numbers and it is
estimated there are now approximately fifty descendants of the
original six birds that escaped from an aviary in 1936.

Chairman and Council on behalf of our members. This is the fifth
successive year that the Society has been invited to visit Chester Zoo
and the warmest thanks of our members are due to the Director-
Secretary, Mr. G. S. Mottershead, for making this very enjoyable
annual event possible. The weather was perfect, the grounds were at
their very best, the birds and animals were, of course, of ever-increasing
interest (mention might perhaps be made of the latest arrivals, a pair
of Malayan Tapirs), everything possible was done to make the visitors
feel welcome. What more could one wish ? Yes, we have been
invited again for next year. A. A. P.

BEHAVIOUR. By Derek Goodwin. Museum Press, Ltd.
London, 1961. Price 12^. 6 d. net.
This second book in the series is a worthy successor to the introduc-
tory volume Bird Biology , by J. D. Macdonald (reviewed in the
Nov./Dec. number 1959 of the Avicultural Magazine).
Derek Goodwin has a wide and intimate knowledge of the day-to-
day life of birds gained not only by long and careful study in the
field, but also on birds he has himself kept in captivity and observations
made in zoos and other collections. He presents the subject in a lucid
and interesting manner and, as he himself writes in the preface, he
has tried to write this book in plain English and to use such special
terms (" behaviour students' jargon ") only where really necessary.
This will be greatly appreciated by those who--the reviewer admits
to be one--become somewhat bewildered by the mass of newly coined
terms which delight the hearts of so many who write on bird behaviour.
The author not only provides a wealth of information but takes
every opportunity to suggest how his readers may obtain additional
facts, and the book is undoubtedly an invaluable guide to ornitho-
logists, whether young or old, who wish to study bird behaviour.
All through the book the author demonstrates that bird behaviour
is " instinctive " and, in most cases, not even learnt, but there is a hint
now and again that he thinks birds may have some perception of what
they are doing--a view strongly supported by the reviewer.
The author gives good counsel regarding appropriate human
behaviour, particularly with regard to visiting colonies of nesting gulls
and terns, and observing roosting birds at night.
This is altogether a delightful book and one that should be bought
by all aviculturists, who, alas, all too frequently miss the opportunity
of observing the behaviour of their birds.

small and dainty. In the early morning I catch half a hundred or more, taking them
off walls and boards. At that time they are quite sluggish, thus easily caught. The
temperature in and about the aviary has been rather cool, both daytime and night-
time, yet these moths breed freely. I feed them to Titmice, Flycatchers, and Yuhinas
every morning " before breakfast The birds like these dainty delicacies very much.
As seedmoths escape from the finch-section into the softbill-section, occupants of the
latter of course help themselves freely to these welcome live morsels.
Perhaps other members have had experience with these tiny moths and can give
further relevant information concerning their breeding.

THE NATIONAL SHOW

<bodyText confidence="0.907776961538462" page_id="56315762"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
In his letter Mr. Murray suggests that the show cages for Canaries, Budgerigars,
and foreign birds are quite in order and suitable for the exhibits. Fair enough,
I quite agree. His objection is to the size and colour of British bird show cages and
with this I disagree.
A bird which is 4^ to 5 inches in length must not be exhibited in a cage less than
II by 9 by 4^ inches. This is the size of cage recommended for Siskins, Redpolls, and
Goldfinches. The size of the cage for birds such as the Greenfinch and Bullfinch
which are themselves approximately 6 inches in length, is 12 by 10 by 5 inches.
Compare these with the budgerigar, 8 to inches in length and whose cage measures
14 by 12 by 6 inches. The Yorkshire Canary: length of bird approximately or
6f inches. Size of cage 9 by 6 by 13 inches high. Norwich Canary : 6 inches in length.
Size of cage similar to that for Bullfinch. Small foreign waxbills : usually exhibited
in pairs. Show cages similar to that of Redpoll.
British and foreign softbills are exhibited in larger cages for reasons which
Mr. Murray should well know. If he does not, I will be only too pleased to
enlighten him.
Your readers will be able to draw their own conclusions from the above. As for the
colour of the interior of British show cages (Aspinalls jade green), this shows up the
colour of Goldfinches, Bullfinches, Chaffinches, etc., but does not show the Greenfinch
to advantage. On the other hand, the white interior of a Budgerigar show cage,
does not do justice to the albino or white, and the white or light coloured foreign
birds are not shown to advantage either. I submit that the exhibiting bird fanciers
on the whole, whether interested in Budgerigars, Canaries, foreign, or British birds,
do show their exhibits in clean and proper cages. As for the " bad old days when
shows were held in the back rooms of dubious public houses ", Mr. Murray is
evidently one who attended, as he seems to know all about them.

THE NEW ZEALAND PIED TIT
By Alan R. Longhurst (Freetown, Sierra Leone, West Africa)
The rather sombre beech and podocarp forests which still cover so
large a part of New Zealand are enlivened by two species of the
flycatcher genus Petroica. These small, alert birds of the ground or
shrub layer in heavy forest, have a superficial resemblance to the
European robin ( Erithacus) in shape and movement, but are quite
clearly more closely allied to the Muscicapidae. Birds of this and
related genera are rather widely spread in the Australasian region and
have become specialists in island-hopping, so that a considerable
number of isolated island races of several species may be recognized. In
New Zealand, the birds may be divided into " tits 55 (sub-genus
Petroica) and " robins " (sub-genus Miro) ; the latter bear a very close
resemblance indeed to the European Robin but lack its red breast,
while the tits are smaller and generally more strikingly marked.
In the North Island, the Pied Tit (P. macrocephala toitoi )--which is
illustrated on a branch of southern beech--is a common bird of the
shrub layer in the native and some exotic forests, while the Robin,
which feeds more at ground level, has almost disappeared before the
invasion of cats, rats, and stoats and is now only to be found in a few
mainland areas and in the island sanctuaries. The writer has a very
vivid memory of a pair of Robins feeding, literally around his feet, in the
dense coastal forest on the slopes of Kapiti Island. Pied Tits, which are
as tame and fearless of man as most New Zealand passerines, may be
watched at almost as close quarters in any block of mainland forest.
Insect eaters, they are constantly on the move--generally in pairs--
now dropping to the ground for an insect, now perching on the side of
the trunk of a great podocarp, and may be attracted, even closer to the
watcher than they normally approach, by a squeaking noise from the
lips or from cork and bottle. It is said that they are at once attracted
to the sound of an axe in the forest.
The South Island form (P. m. macrocephala ) generally known as the

146 A. R. LONGHURST-THE NEW ZEALAND PIED TIT
Yellow-breasted Tit differs only in the colour of its breast and in
unimportant size differences ; it remains common in most forest areas.
On several of the groups of islands off New Zealand geographical races
may be recognized which show--as Dr. Fleming has recently demon-
strated--some most interesting variations. In the Chatham Island race
there is a tendency for the female, drab in the mainland race, to
develop the male pattern in its plumage, and this tendency is carried to
its conclusion in the Auckland Island race, from far to the south of
New Zealand, in which male and female are superficially similar. On
the Snares a completely melanistic race occurs.
It seems probable, apparently, that this series of subspecies is very
closely related to--and may even be conspecific with--the Australian
Scarlet Robin (P. multicolor ) in which the nominate race has a rich
scarlet breast, but is otherwise similar to the New Zealand species, and
which itself includes a number of island races which extend from
Norfolk Island to the Solomon Islands.
As with most New Zealand passerines, there has been very little
detailed study of the behaviour and ecology of these birds, though much
very fine work has been done on various sea birds in the country.
Perhaps some day an explanation will be given of a very curious habit
of the male of the pair of Robins watched at arms length on Kapiti. It
was feeding on the ground, among a litter of dry leaves which were
hunted quite systematically and below which insects appeared to be
detected, probably by\sounds. At frequent and regular intervals the
bird would perch on a dry twig, or the main rib of a large dead leaf, and
putting its weight on one leg would vibrate the other foot so that its
outline was blurred and a hissing, rustling noise was produced--but so
soft that only the nearness of the bird made it audible. Was the noise
deliberate or accidental, and is this a normal feature of Robin feeding
activities ? Could such a sound induce insects to move and give away
their positions and, if so, does the habit occur in any other birds ?

J. R. LOWE-THE BREEDING OF THE BRITISH STONECHAT 1 47
THE BREEDING OF THE BRITISH STONECHAT
(Saxicola torquata hihernans )
By the Rev. J. R. Lowe (Coin St. Aldwyns, Glos., England)
During the autumn of i960 a hand-reared pair of young Stonechats
were received and wintered indoors with no heat throughout the
winter. They were very tame and took mealworms, etc., from my
fingers. At the end of February the birds were put out into a planted
aviary 36 ft. X 36 ft. X 6 ft. 6 in., with a double-compartment, old
pigeon loft as an indoor shelter.
On 25th March the cock Stonechat was noticed in display and
occasionally chasing the hen. The display was interesting, as in so
many courtship displays, the bird altered his whole contour and
changed from a rather chubby little bird to one that was long and thin,
the head thrown up, the tail flicking, all the white areas, such as white
collar and white wing-coverts appeared continuous, and white rump
much in evidence. This was accompanied by a curious slow butterfly
flight from one part of aviary to the other and a good deal of loud
clicking from the cock. The hen appeared rather indifferent to this
activity. At this time the cock produced a more attractive little
warbling song. On 26th March the hen had a dead leaf in her beak,
though I couldn't believe she was really building ; between 26th March
and 2nd April we had discovered the nesting site, about 2 ft. 6 in. up
in a tightly clipped Lonicera nitida bush close to the aviary wire.
A tremendous foundation of leaves and sticks and dried stalks and dead
grass was first laid and the cup of the nest began to be fashioned and
lined on 6th April. Lining continued on 7th April, a few feathers were
used but moss and dead grass formed most of the lining. The hen did
all the building ; once or twice the cock picked something up and
while the hen was on the nest took it to her and for a minute or two
both were inside the bush, but the cock was inside only for that brief
time. On 8th, 9th, and 10th April both visited the nest, cock some-
times calling hen to visit the nest, which was complete and not added to
as far as one could observe after 7th April, so that the nest was com-
pleted in 13 days. On the evening of the 10th the hen looked a bit
thick and on the morning of nth April there was one egg. Both birds
were still ridiculously tame and still took mealworms from anyone who
cared to offer them and the hen, all through her building activities,
never turned a feather, no matter how close people were to the nest.
Five eggs were laid. The birds were not seen to pair.
On the evening of 28th April the cock met me in the shelter com-
partment with a newly hatched Stonechat in his beak ! He flew down
at my feet and laid the baby on the floor. It kicked slightly and I picked
it up, warmed it in my mouth, and transferred it to the nest: the

mother grumbled slightly, but received it without leaving the nest and
shuffled it and her eggs like an old hen ; I fled from the aviary,
wondering if I ought to remove the cock. On 29th April a quick look
at the nest when the hen was off revealed two tiny open mouths and
two eggs. I felt a little better, but wondered about the fifth egg. Was
the chick I rescued the first victim, or the second ? Had the cock
poured two babies out with the bath water, or only one ? Was this
nest cleaning gone sadly awry ? Was a baby mistaken for an egg shell ?
He never made the mistake again.
30th April. There was one chick and two eggs. The nestling appeared
healthy and down looked dry, and growth was considerable even in
twenty-four hours. The chick continued to grow rapidly. I was rather
worried about food as ants' eggs were scarce and insect life in the aviary
not abundant, despite a fairly liberal heap of manure in one corner.
The weather was rather dry. Maggots were not used in feeding and the
main diet of baby was cut-up mealworms ; soft-bill food and hard-
boiled egg was always available. On the eighth day I put a closed
ring on the baby.
On 10th May the hen met me carrying building material ! My
heart sank ; the nest was empty and was being redecorated. Under
the bush was the baby, dead but an hour or two, and the two infertile
eggs. I could have wept. On 15th May there were three new eggs in
the old nest, and two more appeared. All the eggs were very round,
a pale greenish-blue, with faint reddish spots at one end.
On 30th May a chick hatched and did well, other four eggs infertile.
Ringed on the eighth day, it was turned out of the nest on the ninth
day. My cup was full ! A friend had sent a big box of wood-ant eggs,
accompanied by a considerable number of highly indignant wood ants,
and the second Stonechat baby had done even better than the first.
Was it the ringing that had caused this hideous infanticide ? Was it
possible that in the first case the hen had come into breeding con-
dition too quickly a second time, because with only one chick to feed
she hadn't enough to do ? The cock did most of the feeding after the
first few days and nearly all the nest cleaning. There must be a big
difference in looking after one nestling instead of five and often six ?
On 16th June I discovered that the hen Stonechat had decided to
have a third go. She had chosen an old coco-nut husk, about 5 feet
from the ground, and had laid as far as I could see three or four eggs, j
Not very much of a nest, just a little lining of dry bents. Five eggs were ;
laid ; and I decided no more beastly closed rings. Anyhow I could j
not have got at the babies to ring them.
To cut this third story short, on 14th and 15th July three young
Stonechats left the nest and have continued to do brilliantly to date, \
14th August. They were reared for the first week largely on wood-ant
eggs, which they shared with a family of young Goldfinches that were

hatched about the same time in the same aviary, and with meal-
worms ad lib .
The old pair of Stonechats are now in a heavy moult. The babies
(a cock and two hens) are in a separate aviary, looking very sleek and
reasonably tame. They have been persuaded to take maggots and
large quantities of earwigs, caught in pots near the dahlias. So ends this
saga, and we wonder how often Stonechats have been bred in captivity
before.
The latest acquisition is a pair of Goldcrests, hand-reared.
The most charming bircjs I have ever had. Embarrassingly friendly
and prefer one's company to one's absence, which could make one
conceited. They have now got their crests and are, I think, a pair.
The cock has been actually going through a form of display and singing
as I have been writing ; I begin to wonder if he does not get too
rough at times and I may have to put a partition in their cage. But
they are the most delightful of all the British softbills that I have ever
had. It seems amazing that at so early an age the cock should be in
display with gold crest erect and tail fanned out and wings dropped.
We hope to persuade them to go to nest next spring.
Cockatiels and Dwarf Ruddy Ground Doves have been reasonably
prolific this season.

By E. L. Taylor (Guildford, Surrey, England)
To provide the pleasure of watching birds in flight is a branch of
aviculture that makes its own appeal, falconry doubtless affording the
finest spectacle. I can well understand the obsession of Frederik II of
Hohenstaufen who, in the thirteenth century built palaces for his
falcons and, whilst making history for Europe, wrote (by his own hand)
a long and interesting account of this sport of kings.* In our age of
spreading populations, more numerous and mobile than ever before,
it is too difficult to secure the hawks and to find the necessary space ;
on which account we must be content with fowl of humbler kind. For
my own part it is high-flying tippler Pigeons and liberty Budgerigars--
and I do not apologize for the implied comparison with Goshawks and
Peregrines.
Although I know the subject to be taboo in the Avicultural
Magazine I should like to make one brief reference (for the purpose of
illustration only) to those high-flying tipplers that I find so interesting ;
birds completely under my control, that can be released at will and
watched, by the naked eye or through binoculars, as they mount higher

and higher, until sometimes they enter clouds, or are out of sight in the
blue sky. To know those birds as individuals, that only an hour ago were
held in one's hand, who's young are in the nest, with their feathers
just beginning to burst from the quill ; to watch their enjoyment in the
air is to enjoy flying oneself. One cannot be quite so intimate with
Budgerigars, but one can have these lively birds under some control at
least, and produce in one's own garden a most excellent display of
avian aerobatics.
I am not versed in the history of the art of keeping birds at liberty :
I suppose the Duke of Bedford to have been the first to work out a
system of managing Budgerigars in this way, although I should be
interested to know how much of it was original, and how much had
already been practised with other kinds of cage birds, perhaps for
hundreds of years. Of course I studied his method with care. It is
well explained in his excellent little book, which, however describes
rather grandiose accommodation, and savours here and there of a past
age.*
The starting point of my experience was the acceptance of five
Budgerigars as a gift from the village decorator. There were three
green and two blue, of a very ordinary kind and to these I added seven
others, two " yellow-winged greens ", two ## white-winged blues ", two
## cobalts " and a ## white They were all of the cheapest procurable,
and I made no attempt to secure so-called ## homing Budgerigars ",
considering it unlikely that such a character could, as yet, have become
fixed in any strain.
Indoor accommodation was quickly constructed in part of a large
shed, and during that winter I erected the flight outside. It was of very
modest proportions compared with the one recommended in the guide
book, 7 feet high, 7 feet wide and 13 feet long. I also constructed a
number of nest-boxes, in readiness for the proposed increase of stock
during the next two seasons, as it was my intention to build up towards
one hundred birds before release in 1958.

The first season was a failure, owing to my lack of understanding of
the psitticine mentality. It was not that my architectural potentialities
were at fault, rather than that my dwellings were too desirable. Some
of the designs made a tremendous appeal, but in so doing aroused the
envious nature of the Budgerigar hens. I was amazed to find the
savagery that lay deep down in the character of those little birds. It
was made clear to me that if a Budgerigar really wants something that
belongs to another, and murder is the most direct way of getting it,
then murder it is. Eggs were thrown out, young birds similarly disposed
of, and even adult hens done to death in their own bed chambers.

The persistance of the aggressors was both painful and wonderful to
behold. There was no cessation until an entrance had been forced

In preparation for this second year, therefore, I erected a " slum ",
a long hollow tube, square in cross section and partitioned into twenty
dwellings, separated from one another by thin asbestos walls ; with
identical front entrances and identical back doors--also of asbestos.
The door latches were identical and the floors were standard floors ;
the only way to differentiate between one and another was by the
numbers that were painted in plain standard figures on the front and on
the back. I destroyed the distinguished architecture--the houses of
character--and calm returned to the commune. Of course infanticide,
and ovo-infanticide continued to a certain extent, some of the hens
still being activated by envy of another's family--envy seems to be the
besetting sin of the Budgerigar--but it was not now the expected end of
eggs and young, and before the summer was over there had been a
three-fold increase.
Although the numbers were still not quite what I thought they ought
to be before venturing to let the birds fly out, I decided to start in
the following season, whether Budgerigars seemed to be sufficiently
numerous or not. During that winter I constructed the ladder exit and
the lobster-pot entrance hole, as described by the Duke of Bedford.

At last, on a fine and calm Saturday morning in April, I opened
the door at the top of the ladder that led to the open air of a large
garden, with many trees, and rural surroundings, where there is no
confusion of similarity of human dwellings and of gardens. There were
now between thirty and forty Budgerigars in all, and I watched several
of the more venturesome climb up the ladder and fly away in obvious
glee. Perhaps a dozen went out at this time and flew swiftly around
in a magnificent aerobatic display. Their skill on the wing was even
better than I had supposed it to be, and their delight in the newly-
found freedom was a pleasure to behold--but they did not return.

Fig. 2.--Front entrance of Budgerigar row houses.
Now and again I saw one fly across the garden, often high in the air,
but without appearing to recognize the place where it belonged. One
or two did eventually find the way into the flight, but it seemed only
by chance that they happened to be near their home, where they saw
the other Budgerigars, and ultimately found the way in.
This first trial of the Duke of Bedford's method seemed, therefore,
almost a complete failure, and I was very disappointed. Clearly
something else must be done, or I should lose the lot. As it was, I had
lost 80 per cent, or 90 per cent of those that I had allowed to go out,
and a halt was called while new methods were considered.
For this purpose it seemed wise to invoke the scientific approach
and start from first principles. I perceived that the problem that faced
me was an educational one, of perception, recollection and facilita-
tion. The senses through which the appeal had to be made were those
of hearing and of sight. Although in no way melodious these birds are
at least vocal--so I reflected--they might even be considered vociferous.
I concluded that they must have a language, of a sort, not for the
communication of information, but a mere talk for the maintenance of
contact, and continued assurance of good fellowship--as of washer-
women at work, or of school girls on a picnic. How could I use this

to bring birds home ? Had the technologists produced any recent
developments that might help ? These were the lines along which my
thoughts ran, and it so happened that my boy Jan had recently bought
a tape-recorder, why not, (I thought), make use of this modern equip-
ment to amplify the normal chatter ? Better still, why not make the
birds say something appropriate, record that, and then reproduce it
very loudly ?
Acting on this idea I bought a reel of tape, borrowed Jan's recorder
and proceeded in the following way to elicit the calls that seemed best
suited to the purpose of bringing lost Budgerigars back to their home.
It is a most commendable arrangement in the Budgerigar community
that the hens shall stay indoors to sit on eggs and tend the very young,
and free the cocks to carry on with little flirtations, to enjoy the open
air and at night to repair to a comfortable shelter, a sort of club, away
from the hens, where, after a little more talk they can go to sleep,
looking forward to the beginning of another pleasant day. Nothing
was easier, therefore, than for me to go down there after dark and to
close the little door between the shelter and the flight, where the hens
were, in the nest-boxes, with eggs and young. I found that if this were

done, and the two groups were kept apart, on the following morning,
they made an increasingly loud and anxious noise for two, three or
four hours. Translated into human tongue it would represent the
continuous shouting of the following words and phrases :-- ## Where
are you ? 5 5 --" Come here "--" I want you "--" Come quickly "--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.948337666666667" page_id="56315782"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">

## I'm starving "--" Wherever are you ? "-- ## We're all starving "--

<bodyText confidence="0.990497189189189" page_id="56315782"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
with increasing emphasis, and, one may suppose, with mounting tonal
quality of anxiety such as human ears may be unable to detect, but that
might nevertheless be recorded and amplified by a tape recorder.
A temporary family separation was therefore brought about, and
when the wailing had reached a very high pitch I made a 35-minutes
recording before opening the door between the flight and the shelter,
and permitting the reunion so long over due. The recording was
vetted by Jan, who had pronounced it ## reasonably good " (he would
never admit to perfection) and on the following day I made another
essay with liberty Budgerigars.
As at the previous trial, perhaps a dozen soon found the ladder and
without hesitation made use of their wings for the exploration of the
unknown. It was quite clear, from the elevation at which some of them
flew, that it was no mere matter of hopping from bush to bush ; they
really meant to go places. On this account I soon began to worry again
about their return, and went down to close the outlet door. As I did
so there were Budgerigars to be heard in near trees and in distant trees ;
I saw them streaking through the garden, or flying higher than the
tallest of the trees, but they seemed to have no idea of coming to inspect
the home with which they were so familiar, on the inside.
The recorder was standing in readiness in the open window of the
shed, so I started its loud reproduction of the agonized calls of isolated
Budgerigars. It would be doing myself less than justice if it were not
mentioned here that I did not expect to see Budgerigars converging
from near and far at every point of the compass, but I must admit to
having been a little disappointed that the effect was not more marked
than it actually was. All I can honestly report is that it certainly did
operate to a relative degree. On three occasions, late in the day, when
lost Budgerigars were seen or heard in willows or in apple trees I ran
down the garden to switch on the recording, and on two of those
occasions saw the birds almost immediately take notice and fly towards
the sound, so finding their way in.
Taking stock, after this trial I had to conclude that the use of modern
equipment had not been successful. I had lost another eight or ten
birds, one or two nests of young ones had perished in consequence, and
in general it had been an unhappy experience. Education through
amplified Budgerigar talk was not a feasible proposition and it was

clear that I must think again. It even occurred to me that I might have
made a fool of myself in front of the avian world ; perhaps the language
that I had amplified so greatly was abusive ? If so, then what a story
for Sparrows to laugh at !
i960
One hope still remained, and since the application of the method
ought to have been so obvious to me I can only blame myself for not
having used it and been successful in the first place. Pigeons are the
best and most reliable of all liberty birds, yet even Columba livia needs
a little education about the appearance of home from the outside. At one
time I used to lose a number of young pigeons when first they were
allowed out of the loft. They would take off from their well-known and
well-loved home, never to return, and this simply because they had
never been taught to recognize it from the outside; in fact they had
never seen that view at all.

The education of my pigeons has latterly been effected in three
stages, ( a ) to get to know the inside of the home, where there is food
and safety, {b) to learn the way into it from confinement in a wire-
netting cage immediately outside the entrance door, and (c) to learn
what home looks like from the outside. This last item of education is
effected through placing the pigeon in a cage away from its home. The
cage must be adequately large for its composure so that it may quietly
exercise the mental process of perceiving the appearance of its home.

The young birds are confined in this way for a day at a time in each
of three or four parts of the garden from where the loft may be seen.
At the end of each day, when they are both hungry and thirsty, I
place them in the wire-netting cage immediately outside the entrance
door, from where they must make their own way in to find the food
and water. This they are very anxious to do, and since following this
procedure I have only lost one newly-acquired adult, and not any of
the young ones.
But how could I apply this method to Budgerigars ? That was a
different question. To receive impressions of the outward appearance
of their flight they must be in a sufficiently composed state ; and that,
I considered, could hardly be expected after the flurry of a catching do,
or in the crowded conditions of a portable cage. I then wondered if I
could employ a part, only, of the " training course for pigeons ", and
while thinking of this possibility it occurred to me that those Budgerigars
which I had lost had been full-fed at the time of release, and so went off
without a care to explore the wonders of a new world. Suppose they
had been very hungry, might not they then have been anxious to find
food rather than to take exercise ?
Out of this came the idea of closing the doorway between shed and
flight at night, when all the cocks and many of the young birds were
roosting indoors ; keeping them there without food or water until
late on the following morning. Then, when they were very anxious
indeed, the hens in the flight shouting their heads off and the cocks in
the roost ravenously hungry, to release the cocks, not through the little
Budgerigar doorway leading to the flight, but through the ordinary
door that I used myself, leading to the main part of the shed. If the
window were widely open on the flight side the birds would escape that
way into the garden, and, hearing the loud calling of the hens, would
fly onto the top of the flight, see the food, and exert their utmost
endeavours to get in.
Everything was now carefully prepared for the new trial. A few
things were tidied away in the shed and one or two stray branches
lopped from the dogwood bushes outside, to give an unobstructed view
of the flight from the shed window. In the end I was satisfied that every
encouragement would be given for avian emotions and desires to
operate towards the wished-for end. I decided on boldness. I would
procrastinate no longer with timid trials, but would make all those who
slept indoors that night find their way from the roost to the flight,where
their breakfast was so obviously ready and the hens so anxiously waiting.
I only waited now for the weekend when I should be at home and could
endeavour to cope with unexpected eventualities.
On the evening of Friday, therefore, the outlet to the flight was
closed, and on the Saturday morning the birds found themselves
unable to make the usual exit into the flight. By 9 o'clock there was

and the open window of the shed.
considerable hubbub ; by io o'clock there was shouting ; by 11 o'clock
most of the hens were out of their nest-boxes, shouting as loudly as they
could, and by 11.30 the whole place was in an uproar, at both sides of
the Budgerigar doorway. They were indeed now thoroughly well
attuned, and conditioned to make the required response ; so I opened
the half-door that leads into the shed, opened widely the window at
the back of the flight leading to the garden and retired to a distance to
watch the result. Several minutes passed before the first birds began to
make their appearance, flying straight out through the open window
as though to fly right away. The isolation and the fasting had, however,
sharpened their senses and, in consequence, they made a response to
the calling of the hens by an immediate halt in their career and a
descent onto the top of the flight. Once there nothing could have been
more inviting than the food so obviously displayed ; their one aim was
to get to it quickly ; they found the entrance hole immediately over
the food tray and they entered.
I am sure the behaviourists would have some special term for the
maximum effect that was achieved. "Magnetic" is a word that
might apply. It was like opposite poles attracting ; there were empty
crops and a tray full of food ; there was desperate loneliness and a
wifely welcome, a sight for hungry eyes and a sound to calm distraction.

158 E. L. TAYLOR-EXPERIENCES WITH LIBERTY BUDGERIGARS
I cannot say that the Budgerigars stood in a queue, or that they actually
poured down the lobster-pot entrance, but almost so. They only had
to discover the detail for themselves, everything else had been laid on,
and the percentage efficiency must have been very high indeed.
At the end of the day I concluded that the trial had been very
successful. It had been a good first lesson for the education of my
Budgerigars in the art of homing, so that they now knew something of
the outside appearance of their flight and of how to make their way in.
I thought it still unsafe, however, to release them, full-fed, into the
open, and decided that they must have further lessons of a like kind
before their education had been completed. The whole process was
therefore repeated twice more, and I was pleased to notice on each
occasion an increase in the purposeful nature of their responses. This
was the process of " facilitation " already referred to, the final part
of their educational course.

The ultimate outcome is that we now have a scene from a tropical
clime in the cool comfort of a Surrey garden. The house stands on a
sloping bank, some 35 yards away from a stream that is lined by tall
willows. Under these pleasant trees is level ground that is too wet to
cultivate and is allowed to pass through its own succession of the
floral year : marigolds are followed by foxtail, which introduces the
buttercups, then comes ragged robin with pink-tipped Yorkshire fog,
and latterly, meadow-sweet, loosestrife and the great hairy willow herb.
All are under partial control so that no one kind is allowed to take
complete possession for itself--nor nettles to invade.
In June and July it has a brilliance of green that is unsurpassed and
as the evening breeze turns up the silver side of the willow leaves and
the low sun lights the blue-grey of their trunks and boughs it is a cool
and colourful haven of succulent growth, a place for sun-scorched
Bedouins to dream of. Three strange birds appear as we look down from
the bank above. They fly swiftly across the level bottom and up into
the willows. One of them is blue, bluer than the Kingfishers that
frequent the stream, a second is greener than the grass below, and the
third is white. Soon afterwards another blue one appears from
nowhere, flying steeply down, in a power dive that brings him to within
a yard of the ground ; he then makes a miraculous turn and shoots
like a rocket over the top of the tallest willow tree, to appear again
almost immediately, at the side of the tree. He must have made two
turns with extraordinary dexterity to have reappeared so quickly,
flying towards the birch tree that is over the inlet to the flight, where
he joins the chattering group already there. It is clear that he is a
young bird, enjoying the power of wings and the skill with which he
can make use of them.

E. L. TAYLOR EXPERIENCES WITH LIBERTY BUDGERIGARS 1 59
Later on a group of five fly through the garden and two others, a
dark green and a light green are seen in a rapid chase round a small
hazel tree. They dive over the ridge of the shed clearing it by two or
three inches only, then make an impossibly quick change of direction
and again finish in the birch tree over the entrance hole. Presumably
these also are young birds, to find it worth while expending effort so
unnecessarily. The tree over the entrance hole is the favourite where
I have counted up to eighteen birds at one time. Some seem to spend
most of their day there, and others find a particular pleasure in climbing
up the ladder to go out and then, soon afterwards, climbing in again.
This is repeated at intervals throughout the day, with only short
flights and brief visits to other trees.
There are, of course, other ways of keeping Budgerigars at liberty.
To place nesting-boxes in the garden is one that has the advantage of
cock birds that may continually be seen trafficking with food from
hopper to nest box ; the disadvantage is that of losing most of the
fledglings. One of my acquaintances merely throws the Budgerigar
house open in the spring of the year, come what may. Sparrows
welcome this as a sign of weakness in their enemy man ; so they
make free, usurping the homes of their betters, grabbing the best of
the food and desecrating the nest boxes with abominations of straw in
order that their own misbegotten and impudent brats may be reared
in luxury.
My short experience has convinced me that the Duke of Bedford's
advice is sound ; Budgerigars need a certain amount of discipline. If
too much freedom is allowed, so that they come out full-fed late in the
evening, they are apt to spend the night out ; at first they only do this
occasionally, but later it becomes a bad habit. As they become in-
creasingly familiar with more distant trees they get ideas of still wider
exploration, losing all sense of the security of a particular home, and
forgetting their reponsibility to the community to which they belong.
This is a process of demoralization of liberty Budgerigars such as, in my
opinion should not be tolerated.
On this account I have designed a clockwork apparatus whereby
weights fall and levers move to bring about a morning release at 10.30
and a closing of the door again at 5.00 in the evening, after which all
late-comers must use the lobster-pot opening and stay indoors when
once they have re-entered. I also plan separate winter accommodation
for cocks and hens, and a trap for catching them whenever they must
be handled for any purpose--There is no end to these affairs !

(Oxyura leucocephala) IN CAPTIVITY
By Don Alberto Duran, Director Parque Zoologico,
Jerez de la Frontera, Spain
Two ducklings were received from Las Nuevas, in the marismas of
the Guadalquivir, one on 30th July and the second on 7th August, i960.
The sex was not known. We fed them on minced spinach, beet or
lettuce, wheat, rice, minced liver or meat, and shrimps or minced fish.
The food was thrown into the pool because they would not take food
that was not right in the water. We tried placing the pen below the edge
of the pool with water and food in it but they would not take it.
From 30th July to 5th August the water was changed every day
without cleaning the bottom of the pool but from then on the pool was j
cleaned every week and the water changed daily. The food was taken
from the bottom and sides of the pool but always under the water. The
green vegetables which remained on the surface were also taken. The
birds were very fond of liver.
From 21 st August soluble blue Gobial, a vitamin compound of
vitamin A + B 2 -f pantothenic acid + Golina was put in the water, j
At the same time we began to give them aureomycin (Ghlorotetra-
cycline unrefined, soluble), dissolved in water, once a week.
On 28th August they appeared to become " draggled " by being in
the water. A few days after starting to give them the vitamins and I
aureomycin and cleaning the bottom of the pool this condition cleared
up and from then on they were in completely normal plumage, that is
to say the appearance of being " draggled 55 disappeared.
During the day they spent very little time in the water. They
preferred to feed during the night, from midnight to four in the
morning.
On the 18th October the bird which was received last showed
lameness which prevented it from putting the right foot to the ground.
On examination of both birds it was found that they had some abscesses
in the joints of the feet, some already formed and others in course of
development. On 21st October treatment was begun with injections
of avian " Covapen E 55 based on streptomycin ; 0*40 cc. of this
product was given to each bird for three days, and repeated after an
interval of four days. This treatment was continued until 4th November ,
when they had their last injection. The abscesses had completely
disappeared and since then have not recurred.
The birds are rather quarrelsome, the second, received on 7th August,
dominating the other.

Special mention must be made of the interest and competence of our
technical staff--the curator Senor Lassaletta and the veterinarian Senor
Valverde, thanks to whom we have been able to keep these specimens
alive in captivity, whereas previously they have died within two or
three days of being captured.

The following note has been received from J. J. Yealland :--
The White-headed Duck ranges from southern Europe to north
Africa and eastward to parts of central Asia, some populations being
sedentary and others moving southward for the winter to Egypt,
south-eastern Caspian Sea, Iraq and northern parts of India. It is a
bird that appears to prefer brackish or even salt water to fresh. Accord-
ing to " The Birds of the U.S.S.R." the Savkah, as it is known in
Russia, nests among reeds and rushes, sometimes making use of old
nests of Grebes, Coots and Pochards. Six eggs are said to be the normal
clutch, though as many as thirteen (possibly laid by more than one
bird) have been recorded. There is a record of an incubated egg being
taken from a nest near Astrakhan and left in an unheated room for a
week whereupon it hatched. The food is said to consist largely of plant
matter (seeds and foliage) ; larvae of flies and other insect life, molluscs
and crustaceans also being eaten.

STONE-CURLEW

In June, 1958, Wassenaar Zoo received two South African Stone-
Curlews. The birds were placed in one of the large central aviaries of
the Louise Hall, the bird-hall of Wassenaar Zoo, where they lived
together with several species of exotic pigeons, such as Australian
Crested Pigeons, Bleeding-heart Pigeons, Barbary Doves, and others.
The aviary is planted with oaks, beeches, several coniferous trees, and
some shrubs. It is about 17 feet high and has an area of approximately
25 by 30 feet. The climate of the Louise Hall is to some extent sub-
tropical ; the whole building being chiefly a glass construction,
temperature at day-time rises quickly, but drops equally quickly at
night. In winter, in spite of the fact that only the side aviaries are
slightly heated, it is very rarely that the temperature drops below
zero C. The soil of the aviary is mainly sandy and the Stone-
Curlews did very well there, but we were not quite sure whether they
would turn out to be a true pair or not.
At the end of March, 1960, however, they started making a nesting
mound on the ground, which they placed with one side against a small
shrub (Ligustrum ovalifolium ). Saying they built a nest is giving them
rather too much credit, because what they actually did was to make
a small hollow and bring there some pieces of shell and an occasional
twig. On a later occasion, when they built a nest in September, they
used the leaves of a beech tree as nesting material. The first eggs were
laid on 2nd and 4th April, but no more followed. The eggs had the
characteristic colouring, i.e. dark-brown spots and patches on a light-
brown general colour, but there was a decided difference between the
two, the second egg being lighter in colour than the first one. As we did
not want to disturb the birds, we did not measure the eggs (photograph
1). After two weeks of brooding, one egg was miraculously gone
one morning and no remains were found. Of course we had to enter
the aviary every day and it was remarkable to see the attitude of the
two birds. Whichever bird was sitting on the nest remained there as
long as it possibly dared, but the other bird immediately attacked, or
at least put on a threatening attitude. When staging these vague
attacks the bird muttered excitedly in a low voice. It is not easy to
describe the sound they made, but it was easily understood that it was
meant to frighten us away from the nest.
On 26th April one young one was born (photograph 2). It was |
almost invisible on the soil, being mainly sand-coloured with a few
dark patches on its back and head.

How very effectively this protective colour is used was best demon-
strated when the bird reacted to a warning call or another noise that
made it afraid. In that case the little bird made itself very flat, putting
its head and neck on the ground and lying quite still.
The breeding of birds and especially of those which do not have
the protection of a solid nest, is always a hazardous affair. Dangerous
enemies are to be found practically everywhere. The birds at the Zoo
are, of course, better off, but breeding in an aviary with a mixed
population still requires some precautions. The birds need not fear an
attack from the pigeons and doves in the same aviary. They were as a
matter of fact far too aggressive to allow any of these inhabitants to
come near the nest of the young bird, but in the neighbouring aviaries
there were already some interested spectators : African Red-billed
Hornbills (.Lophocerus erythrorhynchus) on one side and Kookaburras
(.Dacelo gigas) and several Jays on the other side. The wire netting was
perfectly all right for the adult birds, but for so small a youngster there
was definitely danger ahead. Something had to be done, but putting
in narrow wire meshing disturbed the adult birds so much that they
started to trample on the youngster and even began to snap at it. When
we came to the rescue our first impression was that we were too late.
When I took the bird it was quite limp and only after I tried to take
a photograph in its natural hiding posture, I noticed that it was still
alive, though probably unconscious. Immediately I took it home with
me and put it under a thermal lamp in one of my terrariums. At that
time I did not expect it to recover, but soon after it was on its feet
again and quite happy. So far so good, but how to feed a young
Stone-Curlew. The next day it refused all food except for a few meal-
worms, but soon thereafter it took earthworms, flies, balls of minced
meat, etc. Additional ingredients were hard-boiled eggs, ground dried
shrimps (after softening), but except for live insects, worms, etc., it did
not take one bit of food unless I put it on a saucer right in front of it
piece by piece. I had to put every bit of meat and shrimp and every
half-dead fly before it to make it eat. In this manner it was fed all the
day through from morning till late at night.
Except for the muttering scolding voice of attack, we never heard a
sound from the adult birds, but the young one often uttered a squeaking
tone, rather high and resembling the noise a badly greased barrow-
wheel makes. I heard this noise all day through whether I was in the
room or not and also often in the late evening hours.
A terrarium is not exactly the place where one generally puts birds
and this one, only measuring about 2 feet long and feet wide, was
certainly not a proper place to keep a Stone-Curlew.
This is why, when I was in the room, I took it out and allowed it to
walk through the room at liberty. When a week or two old I also took
it outside with me and as soon as I made the squeaking noise I was used

to making as an imitation of its own call it always started to run quickly
towards me (photograph 3).
If, however, I clapped my hands it went down to the ground in its
hiding posture with its head, neck, and belly flat to the ground. After
six weeks it started to fly a bit once in a while and within a week or
ten days I felt that it was about time for it to become self-supporting.
It was brought back to the Louise Hall in a central aviary, but of
course not the same where the old pair was still residing. It is now
sharing its place with a pair of Crested Wood Partridges and a
European Roller. It was only here that it had to learn to find its food
itself and not to be hand-fed, but this it learned pretty quickly and
fiercely counter-attacked the Roller if it dared come near any piece of
food which the Stone-Curlew regarded as its rightful own (photograph
4). When attacking it spreads its wings and mutters the low sound its
parents did when they were nesting. However, if I enter the Hall and
utter the imitation squeaking sound of the young bird it still answers
and starts to run towards me as quickly as it can.
This same year we had three other nesting attempts. On 1 ith May
and 27th June, one egg was laid but the birds did not brood.
On 28th September, out of the second real nest which was constantly
brooded, two young were born, but they died shortly after birth
without ever having been on their legs at all.

(Columba speciosa)
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
Supplementing my brief report (in the last number of the Magazine)
on the behavior of the three Splendid Pigeons which have been in my
aviaries for three years, I am pleased to state that yesterday, 28th June,
their first youngster flew off the nest. The young pigeon is in vigorous
health, and, like its parents, arboreal in habit. While the young of many
other species of foreign doves and pigeons when leaving the nest for the
first time are prone to drop to the floor of the pen and to remain there
until they have achieved some dexterity in flying, the young Splendid
Pigeon flew directly to a high branch in the aviary and has to this
writing not dropped to the ground.
Whereas the mature pigeons have a rather bright red beak, one of
the attractive features of this species, the youngster's beak is black, as
are its feet. The overall coloration of this young pigeon is a non-glossy,
rather drab rust-red. The white spots, so conspicuous on mature
specimens, are entirely absent from the plumage of the young pigeon.
However, the lower abdomen shows a whitish-grey color.
Most unusual and " unpigeonlike " has been the behavior of the
three old birds in that there has not been the slightest tendency to
fight the third bird, which I believe is a hen. Moreover, while pigeons
usually become quite jealous of their nesting territory during breeding
seasons, defending it vigorously, the Splendid Pigeons have never in any
way exhibited aggressive behavior toward a male Bartlett's Bleeding-
heart Pigeon which shares their aviary. In these respects the behavior
of the Splendid Pigeons has, at least in my forty years' experience with
both domestic and wild species, been unique. Incidentally, one of the
parent birds remained on the nest with the youngster day and night
until the latter flew off the nest, having been in it for well over three
weeks.
I now believe that the reason why these pigeons did not raise their
first squab, which I found dead in the nest when it was about ten days
old, to maturity is that undoubtedly they were frightened off the nest
during the night. When they failed to return to it promptly, the young
squab, still very much in need of warmth, died of exposure, even though
its crop was well filled.
Since this is the first time in many, many years that Splendid Pigeons
have bred successfully in any American aviaries, I should appreciate
learning if and when this species was first raised in the United States

Laughing Jackasses, have been exhibited in the National Zoological
Park almost continuously over the years. The first ones were sent by
Dr. F. W. Goding, United States Consul at Newcastle, New South
Wales, in 1903. With their handsome appearance and raucous
laughter, they are always favorites with their keepers and with the
public.
Kookaburras in this Zoo had been shown in rather bare cages,
furnished with perches, and had never shown any signs of nesting until
a special cage was arranged for them last year. This was prepared by
the keepers of the bird division as an exhibit of tree-nesting birds. Into
it were put a pair of Kookaburras obtained from Sir Edward Hallstrom,
President of the Taronga Zoological Park Trust, Sydney, Australia, in
1954. Sharing the cage were a pair of Grey Hornbills ( Tockus birostris ),
two Golden-backed Woodpeckers ( Brachypternus benghalensis) , one Scaly-
bellied Woodpecker [Ficus squamatus), and ten Bobwhite Quail ( Colinus
virginianus) . The quail were removed when nesting activities by the
Kookaburras were first detected. The hornbills were removed when the
young were ready to leave the nest.
The cage, with a glass front, is 15 feet wide, 9 feet deep, and 10 feet
high, and contains several tree trunks of various sizes. A large hollowed
birch, 4 feet in circumference, was selected by the Kookaburras for
nesting. We filled the tree with cane litter up to about 5 inches below
a hole in one side. This opening in the tree was ignored, however, the
birds tunnelling out dirt from an opening mostly underground at its
base, and entering from that point, removing the cane litter from the
lower part of the tree. We then had to put screening inside the tree to
keep the remaining cane litter from falling down on the nest. When the
excavating was complete, performed by both birds, the nest was 2 to
3 inches below ground level.
The first egg, an unblemished white, was laid 22nd February, 1961,
with a second egg laid the following day. The female started incubating.
A third egg was seen in the nest three days later.
The male started sharing the incubation duties four days after the
first egg was laid. Neither bird would leave the nest until the other had
entered. At no time during the twenty-five days of incubation was the
nest seen unattended. On four different occasions the female was

W. F. WIDMAN AND H. M. VOROUS-REARING KOOKABURRAS 1 67
observed calling the male by rapping on the tree with her bill, and the
male responded immediately and entered the nest.
Kookaburras at the National Zoological Park are fed exclusively on
mice--an average of three a day---altered in no way other than cutting
off the tails. It was decided prior to hatching to start the adult birds on
mice that had been frozen, then cut in small sections, and thawed
before feeding. This proved a wise decision as both birds were hesitant
at first in accepting the cut-up mice, but the possibility of their
attempting to feed whole mice to newly hatched young would have
certainly proven disastrous.
On Sunday, 19th March, between 10 a.m. and 1.30 p.m., two-thirds
of the blessed event occurred, the other third some time during that
night or early the next morning. The young, bare of feathers and
helpless, appeared to be all stomach and bulging eyes, even though the
eyes were closed. The first day there was little feeding, six small pieces
of mice.
The second day the unusual actions of the male, turning over leaves
and rooting in the ground as if in search of insects, resulted in our
offering roaches (Periplaneta americana) that were readily accepted. The
second day the female left the nest three times, to eat, bathe, and once
for no apparent reason at all. The male on all occasions immediately
took to the nest. The light over the cage was left on until 10 p.m.,
allowing 15 light hours for feeding.
The food the first few days consisted of large roaches, twenty a day,
trapped and freshly killed, and injected with multivitamins, and mice
cut in quarter-inch lengths. Twelve chopped mice were offered and
approximately four were eaten the second day. By the time the nestlings
were seven days old, twelve mice a day were being fed. These figures
apply to the whole family ; it was, of course, impossible to determine
how much was eaten by the parents and how much fed to the babies.
The adults fed the roaches and mice directly, after having crushed
the roaches with their bills. Even though the mice had been cut in
small sections, the parents held them in their bills and rapped them
against a tree limb until they were thoroughly crushed and pliable
before feeding. The young birds grew rapidly ; at eleven days old they
were three times their size at birth. Their eyes were still closed. They
were eating sixty roaches a day, all injected with multivitamins--
twenty at three different feedings--and twenty-one mice now being
cut in thirds.
The young birds' eyes opened twenty-one days after hatching. They
were then eating twenty-seven mice with twenty roaches a day. When
about four weeks old, the more advanced of the three was seen at the
entrance of the nest on several occasions, but was immediately forced
back by the parents. Thirty days after hatching, the first bird was
allowed to leave the nest. The other two were actually drawn out by

the female standing in front of the entrance offering the food, then
backing out when the young attempted to feed with the offering still
in her bill. This was repeated until she succeeded in her efforts to draw
them out of the nest.
All three birds on leaving the nest were able to fly, only their bills and
tail feathers were not fully developed. They had an overall darker
plumage than the adult birds.
On 9th May, while the young birds were still being fed by the
parents, the female again started nesting. She laid an egg on 1 oth May,
another on 12th May, and a third on 13th May. The first brood were
observed feeding themselves for the first time on 21st May.
Incubation began on 19th May and two of the eggs hatched on
6th June. On 7th June the female threw the remaining egg, which was
rotten, out of the nest and broke it. The first hatching having been so
successful, the same procedure was followed for the second. The two
new babies are doing well.

LONDON ZOO NOTES

The Sams Cranes which bred last year showed no sign of nesting at

the same time this summer, but did so some four weeks later in mid-
July. A possible reason for this was that the survivor of last year&apos;s brood
lived next door and was on occasion offered food by the parents
through the dividing wire-netting, but soon after this young one was
moved out of sight of the adults, they turned their attention to nesting
once more. If in the wild state the young survive, does this crane not
breed each year but remain as a family party for two years, I wonder !
The second of last year&apos;s young, when almost fully grown, died as a
result of being caught and held in order to have treatment for a slight
injury to its beak, a death that might perhaps have been prevented by
the administration of a tranquillizing drug. This year&apos;s chicks hatched
between the 8th and 10th of August.
An arrival of especial interest is a Flame-crowned or Pucheran's
Woodpecker (Melanerpes pucherani pucherani) , new to the collection and
presented, together with a Blue-rumped Tanager ( Calospiza cyanicollis
cyanopygia) , a Black-eared Tanager ( Calospiza parzudakii lunigera) and
a Yellow-rumped Tanager ( Ramphocelus icteronotus) , by Messrs. G. H.
and J. R. Newmark. The Woodpecker inhabits the area from southern
Honduras to western and central Ecuador and a second race (M. p.
perileucus ) ranges from southern Mexico to northern Honduras.
Four immature Rollers collected in Spain by Mr. M. D. England
have been deposited and two Squacco Herons received in exchange.

One fully-fledged young one was found dead on the floor. A second
nest was built in the flight ; a single egg was laid and the resulting
young one was successfully reared. The hen is now sitting for the third
time in the same nest on four eggs. This, too, is an uncommon event,
possibly the first since W. Shore Baily's " first " in 1914.

Hallstrom was up here for three days in the middle of June--his visits
are always memorable. A bird British aviculturists would like to have
is our Fig Parrot * Double-eye ' ( Opopsitta diophthalma festetichi). It is
very similar to 0 . d. diophthalma , which I believe dear old Frost once
brought to England. They are plentiful at 4,000 feet (1,500 feet lower
than we are here at Nondugl). They are easy to cater for--sunflower
seed and fruit--and easy to breed. We have a number. Early this year
we bred one Lesser Bird of Paradise ( Paradisea minor Jinschi) and a
Ribbon-tailed ( Taniaparadisea mayeri) --both young birds have now
grown up. At the moment a pair of Blue Birds of Paradise (Para-
disornis rudolphi margaritce ) have a young one in the nest eleven days old.
This pair successfully bred last year." If only Sir Edward would send

GENETICS FOR BUDGERIGAR BREEDERS. By T. G. Taylor,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975699375" page_id="56315804"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
M.A., Ph.D., and C. Warner. Published for " Cage Birds " by
Uiffe Books Ltd., London, 1961. Price 17 s. 6 d. net.
The Budgerigar has been a favourite object for the study of genetics
in birds for many years, since under domestication it has developed a
very wide range of colour variations and other mutations. Moreover
it is of especial interest as one of the few domesticated species that has
never been crossed with any other species. Dr. Dunker was a pioneer
in this subject and together with Cremer produced tables of expecta-
tion which were given to the Budgerigar Society. These authorities
and also Steiner in Switzerland, showed that the inheritance of colour
in these birds followed the classical Mendelian principles. The best
known work in this country, however, is The Genetics of the Budgerigar
by Professor F. A. E. Crew and Miss Rowena Lamy of the Institute of
Animal Genetics, University of Edinburgh, published in 1935, but this
work has long been out of print, and there was a clear need for a book to
assess the present position of the subject, and to indicate lines of advance.

The various general books on the breeding of Budgerigars, including
such works as Budgerigar Matings and Colour Expectations by F. S. Elliot
and E. W. Brooks, do not attempt to give full genetical details.
The present work will be of great value to the many breeders who
find it difficult to understand the genetical side of Budgerigar breeding.
Dr. Taylor, who studied genetics at Cambridge, has kept Budgerigars
for almost thirty years and regards himself primarily as a fancier, and
during the past four years, in collaboration with Mr. Warner, also a
geneticist, has been engaged in a programme of research on the
mapping of the sex-linked series. The book covers the whole field of
Budgerigar genetics in a simple and direct manner and should be
intelligible to any one prepared to make a serious study of the subject.
The first chapter, based largely on the work of Dr. Auber, deals with
feather structure and colour, and whilst not essential for an under-
standing of the genetics of colour, it certainly adds to the interest of
breeding these birds, and enables predictions to be made of colour
expectation when new combinations of varieties are made by cross
breeding. Then follow chapters on genes and expectations, the
chromosome theory, leading on to linkage and sex-linkage which
then become understandable. Practical breeders will find the chapters
dealing with mutations and what to do with a new mutation of especial
interest ; also the summaries of the composition of the various colour
varieties and how they are produced. The final chapter deals with
genetics for the breeder of exhibition Budgerigars, with a table showing
the proposed names and symbols of mutant genes in the Budgerigar.
This work can be thoroughly recommended to both amateur and
professional breeders who wish to have a better understanding of the
scientific basis of the subject.

BIRD DOCTOR By Katherine Tottenham. Thomas Nelson and
Sons, Ltd. Edinburgh, 1961. Price 15^.
This is an interesting collection of anecdotes of the author's
experiences with many kinds of sick and damaged birds, and the way
in which by trial and error she has learnt how to treat the different
cases. The patients usually became quite tame during the treatment
and the behaviour of such diverse pets as a Razorbill and other sea-
birds, various corvids, Blackbirds and even a Mute Swan, to name
only a few of the birds kept for varying periods after their recovery, is
graphically described. It is noted that once tamed and provided with
the best possible conditions, most pet birds are more than content with
their lot.

PACKING BIRDS FOR AIR SHIPMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96128225" page_id="56315806"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
I have read with interest the article " Packing Game Birds for Air Shipment " by
K. G. Searle in the January-February issue of the Avicultural Magazine. I agree
with Dr. Searle that the padding for the top of the crate is of paramount importance.
With adequate protection against head damage and a satisfactory water supply, the
wildest birds can be safely handled by air freight.
I have a suggestion for padding the top of the crate which may be of interest. In
shipments of birds to Ceylon and to Indonesia, I have found that sheets of foam rubber
make excellent padding for the shipping crates. My crates are constructed of i by
i inch pine frames covered with # inch plywood. The front is covered with ^ inch
mesh hardware cloth with the feed and water troughs set under the edge of the screen.
The top and sides of the crate are padded with foam rubber sheet. For small birds
I use  |inch thick foam rubber and for the largest and wildest, i \ inch foam rubber
sheet.
The sheets of foam rubber are available here from upholsterer shops as scrap pieces
at a reasonable price. The sheets of foam rubber may be glued in place or stapled to
the roof and sides from the rubber side. The staple will be completely imbedded in the
rubber. If the ends of the staples extend through the plywood, they should be bent over
to avoid injury in handling. I have found that some air-lines staple their labels on the
crates and the ends of the staples protrude inside. These sharp points may cause
serious damage to the birds. As these labels are most often stapled on the sides, the
padding of foam rubber covers them so no damage to the birds occurs.

RAIN BATHING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992057769230769" page_id="56315806"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
In his recent article on " Rain Bathing " ( antea 67 : 90), C. J. O. Harrison described
the behaviour of Budgerigars ( Melopsittacus undulatus) " bathing " in green salad, and
concluded that " the recognition of wet vegetation as a bathing medium appears to be
innate
My own observations agree with those published by Harrison, but I have also noted
" bathing " behaviour under the following conditions : (i) in a glass bowl, filled with
water to a depth of 3 or 4 inches, with green leaves floating on the surface of the water
(ii) in a green plastic bowl, filled with water as before, but without any floating
vegetation. Behaviour was equally intense under either condition, but no bathing
occurred in a glass bowl in the absence of vegetation.
It would thus appear that the colour green, in association with water, is sufficient
to release this behaviour, and that the form in which this colour is present is not
important.

By William G. Conway (Director, Curator of Birds)
Sunbirds have rarely been bred in collections. While Mr. Edward
Boehm, of Trenton, New Jersey, has bred the Scarlet-chested Sunbird,
it appears that no other collection has recorded a similar feat. This
paper presents new information on incubation and nesting behavior
as observed in a pair of Tacazze Sunbirds on exhibit in the New York
Zoological Park's Jewel Room.
The breeding female and male sunbirds were both acquired from
Mr. John Seago, on 5th March, 1953, and 7th June, 1958, respectively,
and had been exhibited together for more than a year when it was
decided to attempt to induce breeding with an artificial nest. A small,
purse-shaped nest was constructed of cacique nest walls which we had
brought from Trinidad some time previously. Soon the female was
noted carrying bits of grass and re-arranging the artificial nest ; kapok
was provided for nest lining and the female was left to work. While the
male drove the female frequently and displayed daily, he did not help
build the nest in any way. The courtship display is distinguishable
from threat display, which it greatly resembles, by a strange side-to-
side swinging of the tail.
After more than two months of nest building and courtship activity,
a single pale-bluish, heavily mottled egg was laid by the female on
27th May, i960. One egg is the usual clutch in the wild. The cage
front was covered to prevent the public from disturbing the birds,
but a few days later the egg was found broken in the bottom of the cage.
The cage front was left uncovered hereafter and three further eggs were
deposited in the nest by the female. Incubation periods and the nidifica-
tion periods of the two young which survived to leave the nest are
outlined in the chart below.

It will be seen that the average incubation period was fifteen-and-a-
half days and nidification required twenty days. Incubation and
brooding, for the first seven days, was performed entirely by the female,
which incubated steadily but for short intervals of rest and feeding,
despite the fact that the ambient temperature varied from 72 0 to 88* F.
The young bird was fed by both parents, but here again the female
performed most of the work. Nest sanitation was also performed by
both sexes. The two young birds which successfully left the nest
returned to it for roosting the first few nights, and both birds, which
successfully completed nidification, were found drinking from the
feeding tubes within a few hours of leaving the nest. In rearing the
young birds, the adults fed them some nectar from our feeding tubes,
as well as great quantities of small insects which keepers collected with
sweep nets during two or three sallies each day. Thousands of fruit
flies were made available and the female was often observed to line one
up after another in her beak, like a puffin carrying fish, and then to
pump them into the young bird's gape in a machine-gun-like fashion.
In each case the young bird was removed from the cage within a week
of the completion of nidification.
Sunbirds do extremely well at the Zoological Park on a formula
consisting of: Ledinac (a liver protein hydrolysate, Lederle Labora-
tories), Mellin's Baby Food, sweetened condensed milk, beef extract,
honey, supplementary liquid vitamins, supplementary fruit flies.

This, the most beautiful of the flycatchers, is now too well known
to aviculturists to need a detailed description and both sexes are well
illustrated in Indian Hill Birds by Salim Ali. A plate by Gronvold
appeared in the Avicultural Magazine, New Series, Vol. 2, No. 1
(1903-4), but in this the legs of the male are incorrectly shown as yellow
whereas they should be black, and those of the female should be very
dark-brown. The general colouring of the latter is also far too dusky, the
upper parts being russet and the breast buff with a crescent mark on
the upper breast much less prominent. The " tabs " on each side of the
neck are a brilliant pale blue, although these are often completely
concealed except when the bird raises its head.
The Niltava frequents high forest, usually in the close vicinity of
rock-strewn water-courses where the vegetation is dense and insect
life abundant and, unlike our familiar Spotted Flycatcher, is seldom
seen at any great height above the ground, preferring to perch on
some moss-covered rock or tree root in the deep shade of the moisture-
laden undergrowth, making short flights in pursuit of winged insects
or, more frequently, darting on those moving on the ground. Although
insects form its main diet they are sometimes supplemented by berries
and other small fruit. Its range is given as the Himalayas, from Murree
to extreme East Assam ; Manipur and Lushai Hills ; Chin and Kachin
Hills, and down through the hills of Central Burma to Tenasserim,
Indo-China, and Western China. In summer it is found at elevations
from 5,000 to 8,000 feet, descending in the winter to lower levels and
into the foothills.
Wynne (Key List of the Palaearctic and Oriental Passerine Birds)
mentions three races of Niltava sundara but does not give the range of the
individual races. Those listed are N. s.fastuosa (Lissen), 1840 ; N. s
sundra Hodgson, 1837 ; and jV. s. denotata Bangs and Phillips, 1914,
but I understand that the actual differences between these races are
very slight and as I have no knowledge of the locality from which my
own birds were obtained, it is not possible to say to which race they
belong.
In the Avicultural Magazine, New Series, Vol. 1, November,
1902, Mr. Russell Humphrys describes a male which he received in
June of that year and there is also mention of one being exhibited at the
London Zoo, for the first time, in June, 1901. These birds were
privately imported by Mr. E. W. Harper, a member of the Society at
that time, and were believed to be the first living examples of the species
to reach this country.

176 K. A. NORRIS-BREEDING OF THE RUFOUS-BELLIED NILTAVA
In December, 1957, I was offered a pair of these beautiful flycatchers
which I purchased in the hope that I might be able to induce them to
breed. For some weeks they were kept in a 6-foot stock cage in my
small tropical house, but very soon after their arrival I found it
necessary to separate them as they were constantly bickering, the hen
being particularly aggressive towards her mate whenever he attempted
to feed. The cage was accordingly divided by a wire slide and they
remained separated until the early spring of 1958 when I noticed that
the cock was beginning to sing softly, and the hen to show evident signs
of welcoming this attention. This seemed an opportune time to re-
unite the pair, but rather than risk further trouble in the confined space
of the cage, I left the dividing slide in place and opened both doors,
leaving the birds to find their way out.
At this point I should perhaps explain that the building in which
they are kept is 12 feet by 15 feet, and 9 feet high, built of brick and
lighted from above only, the entire roof being of transparent fibre-
glass, insulated with polythene sheeting, and it is used as a combined
bird and plant house. Humidity is maintained by the presence of a
small pool and a number of fish tanks and it is heated by electricity,
the temperature being controlled at a minimum of 55 0 F. During the
spring and summer months it is heavily overgrown with a tangle of
climbing plants which provide shade and also excellent facilities for
nesting. A number of nest-boxes of various types are hung high up on
the walls and screened by growing plants and branches of cupressus,
the latter being particularly useful for this purpose since it retains its
foliage long after it has been cut.
This accommodation is shared by a pair each of Yellow-winged
Sugarbirds, Zosterops, Yuhinas, Violet Tanagers, and the Niltavas.
The Zosterops in particular are indefatigable hunters of tiny insects and
I have found them invaluable as a means of exterminating both white
fly and mealy bug, pests which are normally so difficult to control in
tropical plant houses.
Early in May the hen Niltava started to build on a rafter immediately
above the entrance door, using long strands of fibre which she had
stripped from the bark of dead branches, dried grasses, and the withered
foliage of narcissus, for the foundation of the nest. The latter material
I have found to be readily accepted by most species of nest builders
as it is pliable and easily woven into position. The Niltava proved to be
a particularly untidy builder, leaving long strands trailing from the
nesting ledge and these caught on the top of the door every time it was
opened with the inevitable result that the partially-built nest was
eventually dislodged and fell to the ground. In spite of this misfortune,
the hen persisted in using this site and to obviate the risk of the nest
again being destroyed I fixed a 3-inch strip of wood to the edge of the
rafter thus forming a shallow tray to hold the materials together. In

this tray the nest was eventually completed, the cup being deep and
beautifully formed of fine grasses and a small amount of moss, but still
with many long strands trailing from the rough foundation. It was not
until the hen was actually incubating that she began to draw up these
strands, weaving them into the rim of the nest and thus building up the
sides until she was completely screened from view.
Three other nests, built later by a different hen, all followed an
identical pattern, the untidy, trailing mass of foundation materials
being gradually drawn up and woven into the sides after the hen had
commenced incubation and I therefore feel that it is safe to assume that
this is the normal method of nest construction followed by the species.
The descriptions of nests of Niltava sundara, quoted by Dr. A. G. Butler
(.Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ), however, differ materially, the
writers stating that those which they had found were loosely made and
very shallow, in one case being a mere pad of moss, with a very broad,
shallow depression in the centre. The eggs are described but no
reference to the young is made and I suspect that, in each case, the
nests were found at an early stage when the hen was still laying and
incubation had not commenced.
For over three weeks the hen continued to sit and on only two
occasions during the whole of that period did I see her leave the nest
to feed. Obviously she must have taken food each day, but her move-
ments had now become very stealthy and she would neither leave nor
return to the nest whilst I was anywhere in the near vicinity.
Contrary to the statement made by Salim Ali (.Indian Hill Birds)
the cock took no part in nest building nor did he share in incubation,
in fact he never even approached the nest site and the only indication
that he was aware of its existence was his constant " scolding " note
if I myself was anywhere near the sitting hen.
Finally the hen re-appeared at feeding time and failed to return to
the nest, apparently having lost all interest, and on examination,
I found three infertile eggs, approximately the size of those of the
English Robin, pale cream in colour, very lightly freckled with reddish-
brown. No further attempt at nesting took place and in the late
summer the hen was found drowned in a fish tank, having apparently
squeezed through a hole in the covering glass which was little more
than an inch in diameter.
It was not until early in the following year that I was able to obtain
another hen, a bird which, although well developed, was obviously
immature, as her plumage was entirely of a very dull brown, completely
lacking the bright russet tones of the tail and upper parts, nor was there
any sign of the pale crescent mark on the upper breast or the brilliant
blue " tabs " on the sides of the neck, and it was not until the autumn
moult that the full adult colouring was attained.
For the first few weeks after her arrival she completely ignored the

cock and he in turn showed little interest in her, but with the approach
of spring she began to exhibit resentment at his increasing attention,
retiring before his approach and occasionally turning on him with
snapping beak. The more the cock persisted, the more she resisted
until he lost his nerve and retired promptly whenever she alighted near
him. Unfortunately I paid little attention to these signs of discord,
thinking that there was ample cover and sufficient room for the cock
to escape to safety should the hen attempt to press her attacks too far,
and although he was obviously making no progress in his efforts to pair,
he appeared to be in perfect condition and gave no evidence of undue
distress.
This unsatisfactory state of affairs continued for some time and then,
one morning, I found the cock dead on the ground. There was no sign
of injury, but he was very thin indeed and there is little doubt that the
hen had persistently refused to allow him to feed, driving him into
cover whenever he attempted to approach the food trays.
Again I experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a replace-
ment, but eventually another cock was secured towards the end of June
of last year. This bird arrived in very good condition and was placed
in the stock cage, the hen being still at liberty, but he soon became so
restless that, in spite of my previous experience, I decided to risk
allowing the birds together and opened the cage doors.
Instead of the cock coming out, however, it was the hen that made
the first advances by immediately entering the cage and giving every
sign of welcoming her new mate. She remained quietly in the cage for
some time and then both birds came out together and the cock promptly
went down to the bath where he proceeded to soak his plumage so
thoroughly that he had difficulty in regaining a perch.
Possibly because the hen was not in full breeding condition and the
cock had not gained sufficient confidence to make any serious advances
to her, there was no sign of disagreement and, in fact, this pair have at
all times remained on the most friendly terms with each other.
The season was already well advanced and, as might have been
expected, they made no attempt to breed. They completed a satis-
factory moult, the hen then assuming her full, adult colouring, and
passed the winter in perfect condition. In April of this year the cock
commenced to sing, or perhaps " warble " would be a more correct
description for the bird has a weak voice and the song, though
melodious and varied, is little more than a whisper, continuing for
periods of up to fifteen minutes without a break. At the same time the
hen became restless, continually moving and searching under the
staging, investigating the darker corners of the building, then flying
to the rafters to continue her search.
It was at this time that I first saw the cock display. He was singing
softly and was apparently completely relaxed, taking no notice of the

hen who was searching amongst low growing plants, but as she moved
directly below him he suddenly " exploded " into violent action, diving
from his perch straight down towards her as she fled with one single,
shrill note of alarm. Three times she circled the room with the cock in
swift pursuit and then both birds came suddenly to rest within a few
inches of each other on the ground, the hen crouching with snapping
beak, and the cock tense and motionless with his back turned half
towards her, tail and flights pressed to the ground, body erect and beak
pointing upwards, displaying to full advantage the beauty of his
shining blue plumage, very much as does the male Golden Pheasant when
displaying to his hens. This display lasted only a matter of seconds and
as suddenly as it had commenced, both birds relaxed, the hen moving
unconcernedly away to continue her investigation of the undergrowth
and the cock returning to his perch to continue singing. No actual
mating had taken place.
At no time had I seen the previous cock display and I am now
inclined to think that the failure of the nesting attempt in 1958 may
have been due to the fact that he never really came into breeding
condition.
Eventually the hen chose a nest-box placed high up on the wall, well
screened by cupressus and climbing plants, and there she constructed
a nest similar in every way to that already described. On the 25th May
she was on the nest most of the day and I imagine laid her first egg,
and from the 27th she commenced incubation and also to tidy up the
foundation of the nest, completing the latter operation in two days.
Fourteen days later she came off the nest at feeding time, and
both birds " scolded " continuously, the hen carrying a mealworm in
her beak but refusing to return to the nest whilst I remained in the
building. As the days passed, however, she became less nervous and
carried food to the nest whenever I was screened from view by the
curtain of climbing and trailing plants which I had allowed to grow
unchecked since nesting commenced and which had now converted
the building into a veritable jungle.
The cock assisted in feeding although his visits to the nest were far
less frequent and he seldom carried more than a single insect at a time,
whereas the hen collected fruit-flies, blow-flies, woodlice, spiders,
mealworms, and gentles, all of which she part-swallowed until her
throat was bulging, before entering the nest-box where she then
remained for some time, apparently feeding the young by regurgitation.
Although mealworms and gentles, of which they had an unlimited
supply, must have formed the bulk of food taken to the nest, woodlice
seemed to be specially favoured and each morning and evening I lifted
every flower pot in the building, the birds immediately pouncing on
any that were thus exposed to view.
On entering the building on the morning of the 20th June, ten days

l8o K. A. NORRIS-BREEDING OF THE RUFOUS-BELLIED NILTAVA
after the young had hatched, I was met by an absolute storm of abuse,
both birds repeatedly flying at my head, and passing so close that on
several occasions I felt them actually brush against my face. As
I moved across the room, a young bird flew strongly from a low growing
shrub onto an electric cable suspended some 5 feet above the ground
and there, fully exposed, it sat watching me with no sign of alarm, in
spite of the urgent warning notes of its parents. At a glance it could
readily have been mistaken for a young native Robin, the whole of the
head, back, and underparts being russet brown, heavily mottled, but
on closer inspection, the wings proved to be entirely dull black and the
extremely short tail of an intense, deep blue. The eyes were large and
very dark, the beak and feet black, the former still with the yellow gape
common to most young passerines.
No further young appeared and as the parents were able to con-
centrate the whole of their attention on their single offspring, it is not
surprising that its development was unusually rapid. Its tail grew to
normal length within a few days and by its colour, proved that it is
possible readily to distinguish the sexes of young Niltavas as soon as they
are fledged. Within four days it was picking up food from the ground
and on the sixth day made a determined, and successful, attempt to
capture a blow-fly on the wing. It is of particular interest to note that
it discovered and gorged on an over-ripe pear which had been left to
encourage fruit-flies, although I have never known the adult pair to
take any form of fruit other than occasionally to pick out a currant from
food which I was preparing for Waxwings. It may have learnt to take
this fruit from the example of other species in the room, but certainly
not from its own parents, although Mr. Russell Humphrys (Avicul-
tural Magazine, November, 1902) mentions that a partiality was
shown by this bird for over-ripe pear and greengage.
In the meantime the hen was already building a second nest in
another nest-box and again commenced incubation on the 27th June.
Young duly hatched on 1 ith July, but three days later one was thrown
out and its condition suggested that it had been dead for at least a day,
although it was possible to see that the down on the head and back was
black, the skin entirely of a very dark colour, and the only relief to this
sombre colouring was the light yellow of the gape. Evidentally the
remaining young did not make normal progress as they remained in
the nest until the 26th July when two were apparently forcibly ejected
by the hen for they were very backward and quite unable to fly.
I replaced them in the nest but the parents obviously had finished with
them and on the following morning, the smaller of the two was again
on the floor, dead. This youngster was entirely brown, including the
wings and tail and presumably was a hen. There was one infertile
egg remaining in the nest and this clutch had therefore consisted of four
eggs which I should imagine to be the normal average.

<bodyText confidence="0.99774025" page_id="56315825"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
The second young bird died on the following day, the adult hen now
being fully occupied in building a third nest, whilst her mate and also
the young cock from the first nest were both singing continuously, the
young bird's voice being already fully developed.
The culminating tragedy occurred three days later when the hen
was found dead with a shell-less egg entangled in her breast feathers,
and I can only blame myself for her loss as I had discontinued the use
of powdered cuttlefish bone and " Radiostol " which I normally add
to the soft-food mixture during the nesting season, and which I have
always found to be invaluable in preventing egg-binding.
Now (30th August), the young cock is rapidly assuming full adult
colouring, brilliant blue feathers appearing on the back and head, and
clear chestnut spreading from the flanks and gradually replacing the
mottled brown feathering of the underparts. He is bold and extremely
inquisitive, even alighting on my arm to inspect parcels of fruit or
food trays which I may be carrying, and when I was carrying out
alterations to one of the enclosures recently, he spent some time by my
side, removing some twenty nails from the tool box and even managed
to drag the lighter tools across the floor.
As described above, K. A. Norris has bred the Rufous-bellied Niltava
(,Niltava sundara). It is believed that this may be a first success.

The Cayenne Tanager is about the size of a sparrow but is somewhat
slimmer and more graceful being a very curious and active little bird.
The colouring is not spectacular ; the crown is brown with large
black cheek patches. The back of the cock is a golden oatmeal and
wings, tail, and breast blue. The hen is a duller version of the cock.
These birds were sent to me from British Guiana two years ago and
have been fit ever since. In their own country they are known as the
" Buck Town Suckie "--a most attractive name !
At the end of July they started to nest in a branch of broom about
8 feet above the ground. The nest was a very flimsy structure made of
dried grass but it must have considerable strength for in spite of its
fragile appearance it seems strong enough. Two eggs only were laid

and I am not sure of the exact date as the hen was very nervous and
I did not want to disturb her unnecessarily. However, from their
second nest I have seen that the eggs are whitish with black scribblings.
The young are covered with black down.
As far as I could tell the young were a good three weeks in the
nest--a very long time indeed for a bird of this character. Sex was
clearly apparent as soon as the young flew. They were a pair and the
young cock was very like the hen while the young hen was much duller.
The parents were excellent and very devoted to the young. The
young were fed on fruit and my usual softbill mixture. Maggots and
mealworms were also given in large numbers. I tried very hard to see
if these latter were given whole or by regurgitation, but I am pretty
sure that they were fed entirely by regurgitation. Like most Tanagers
these birds ate a considerable amount of seed. This was eaten whole
and not cracked.
At the time that these notes are written the birds have two young
a week old in their second nest, but the summer has run out and it is
a matter of luck whether they rear.
It may be of interest to record that the Redwing with which I was
lucky enough to win the Society's Medal last year is still doing well and
seems to have become a good bird.

(Tangara cay ana ). It is believed that this may be a first success.

By J. E. Collins (Great Houghton, Northampton, England)
I think our members will be interested in the news that my Yellow-
fronted Woodpeckers {Melanerpes flavifrons ) have successfully bred this
year. I purchased these birds in April, 1959, to supplement my show
team, and after acclimatizing them I exhibited them with a fair amount
of success.
In the spring of i960 they were put into a small flight to moult and
to see what intentions they had of breeding. They were given a

hollow log and an old lovebird nest-box ; they went to nest in the
nest-box and laid four eggs of which only one hatched, and the chick
died at about two weeks old. After three weeks 1 noticed the hen
paying attention to the nest-box again ; this time she laid five eggs
but unfortunately there was again only one chick and this died at
ten days. By this time I was convinced that the flight was not big
enough, and as the year was getting on I decided to get them fit and
show them again, which I did with more success.
During the winter of 1960-61 I built a flight of 30 by 10 feet round
some small fruit trees. The birds were put into the new flight during
the first week in May, together with the old nest-box which was hung
on a post 6 feet high and facing south. In the same flight I put a pair
each of Purple Crested Touracos, Cordon-bleus, Spice Birds, Cape
Doves, five Bengalese, and a trio of Golden Pheasants.
Although the Woodpeckers were using the nest-box to sleep in they
gave no signs of going to nest for about five weeks, then I noticed that
they had started to clean out every scrap of peat I had put in to cover
up the perforated zinc false bottom of the box. This went on for two
or three days and at midday on 14th June I noticed an egg lying on
top of a log ; on picking it up I realized it was a Woodpecker egg ;
this caused a few hectic moments, because I had to decide whether to
waste the egg or to chance upsetting the birds by putting the egg into
the empty nest. I thought I would take the gamble and save the egg,
so into the nest it went. The hen was out and about as usual until
16th June, when she disappeared for two or three days. After this
both parents appeared to take turns at sitting for ten to fifteen-minute
intervals. The nest was never left during my presence either for inside
or outside observations. It was eleven days before the nest was left
unattended so I took the opportunity of having a look and, to my
great delight, there were two chicks and one egg which later
disappeared.
For the first two or three days I noticed the birds were feeding only
live ant eggs, on the fourth day they started taking some madeira cake
soaked in Stimulite Nectar, together with some very young maggots.
In a fortnight they fed a little ripe pear and this continued for two
more weeks and they then started feeding grated apple dusted with
Glucodin and Sluis.
On 26th July I saw one of the young looking out of the nest, and on
29th July both young left the nest for the first time ; I did not see
them again for two days but after that they came out regularly. Both
the young are cocks, having identical markings to the adult cock, but
the red and yellow are quite a bit paler. They are now feeding them-
selves and are eating a full mixed diet, except that they are now on
egg food instead of cake ; incidently, the adult birds had egg food at
hand when feeding but it was ignored.

By K. L. Penwarden (Newlands, Cape, South Africa)
I am indeed fortunate in having a very large aviary built on my
property on the slopes of Table Mountain, overlooking the southern
suburbs of Cape Town. During November, i960, my wife and I moved
into our new home and I gathered my birds together from the four
corners of Cape Town where my friends were kind enough to keep
them for me whilst the house and aviaries were being built.
The aviary is approximately 65 feet in length and 12 feet in width
and subdivided into eighteen separate flights. Our members may be
interested in the types of birds in my aviary and the small success
I have had in breeding during this year. I will describe the birds
flight by flight.
Flight No. 1
I have one pair of Fischer's Lovebirds ( Agapornis fischeri ) and they
are presently on eggs having previously reared three youngsters.
Flights Nos. 2 and 16
In each of these flights I have one pair of African Ring-necked
Parrakeets ( Psittacula krameri) but, perhaps as I imported these birds
from Holland during the year, they have not yet gone to nest.
Flight No. 3
The pair of Peach-faced Lovebirds (. Agapornis roseicollis) in this flight
carry my hopes for the future. The hen is completely " rosy " in
colour but the cock does not carry the " factor ". She is presently
on eggs and failing to obtain a cock with some " rosy " or pink
colouring I will be forced to mate her next year with one of her
offspring.

K. L. PENWARDEN-MY AFRICAN PARROT AND PARROT-LIKE BIRDS 1 85
Flight No. 4
The two Madagascar Lovebirds (Agapornis cana) in this flight have
been disappointing as the hen has laid at least eighteen eggs during
the last five months but not one has been hatched due, I think, to
the nervousness of the hen who leaves the nest on the least provocation.
Except for the first set of eggs all the other eggs have been fertile.
Flight No. 5
The two pairs of Nyasa Lovebirds (.Agapornis lilianae) seem to be
poor breeders but have reared one youngster between them.
Flight No. 6
The two Meyer's Parrots (Poicephalus meyeri) have not gone to nest
although I have recently seen them mating. The hen I acquired only
four months ago and she was in bad condition on arrival with her
flights clipped. Normally these birds breed during April to June but
later breedings in the wild are on record.
Flights Nos. 7 and 18
In this flight I had kept a pair of Ruppell's Parrots (Poicephalus
ruppellii) but lost the cock during the year. This loss upset me very
much as both birds escaped from my father's aviary when I tried to
bring them home. After two days at liberty both " homed " and my
father was quite pleased to report that he had recovered my birds.
I have transferred the hen to flight No. 18 and two Budgerigars which
invaded my aviary (gaining access through the large gauge netting)
are now the proud parents of five youngsters in this flight.
Flights Nos. 8 and ij
In flight No. 8 I accomplished my greatest success. During January,
i960, I bought two pairs of Red-faced Lovebirds (.Agapornis pullaria )
from a person who assured me that he had imported the twenty-odd
birds he had for sale from Angola. Quite frankly I had a suspicion
that the birds had entered the country in a rather unorthodox fashion
and for one month kept them far from my other birds. They soon
settled down and each pair would retire for the night in a nest-box.
Although on one occasion I saw a pair mate they ignored the " ant-
heap " I built for them in the branches of the natural perches in the
flight. I managed to acquire a piece of granulated cork (used by
plumbers, I believe) which I cut into squares of approximately
20 inches by 15 inches. After wiring these squares together I obtained
a thickness of about 8 inches. I attached this piece of cork to the perch
in the covered part of the aviary and made a small entrance in the
bottom left-hand corner. Within two days I noticed that the birds
were busy enlarging the entrance. After sixteen days the tunnel had

reached the stage that one pair spent the night in the nest which
enabled me to move the remaining pair to flight No. 13, previously
occupied by a pair of Cape Parrots ( Poicephalus rohustus) which I had t
lost under distressing circumstances a short while before.
The hen bird then disappeared completely and my wife was asked
to keep an eye on this flight during the day to see if the hen came out
to feed. We were never able to detect any sign of her and I was
becoming worried. After a lapse of what seemed to be more than a
month I saw the hen one morning and this delighted me, as I was
leaving for London on business for about twenty days. Just before my
departure from London I received a cable from my wife to say that
three youngsters had emerged fully feathered. On my arrival back
home I learnt that one youngster had managed to get through the wire
and was found dead in the enclosed passage-way. However, at the
time of writing, both surviving youngsters are fit and well and have
now been out for over a month.
The pair in flight No. 13 have not bred but then I have not been able
to find a suitable supply of cork.
This breeding has encouraged me as I believe that it is only the
second success in this country, the first being by Mr. David Dale who,
</bodyText>

Flight No. g
The pair of Abyssinian Lovebirds ( Agapornis taranta) have excelled i
themselves in laying four eggs and hatching all four. At the moment
all four youngsters are still in the nest but I am confident as these
birds of mine are excellent parents.
Flight No. 10
The pair of Black-cheeked Lovebirds (. Agapornis nigrigenis ) are on
eggs and as these birds are good breeders I should have some success.
Flight No. 11
This flight is used by my good friend Mr. Des Healey of Fish Hoek
and myself and we are loath at this stage to disclose our limited
success in our experiment. All we want to say now is that by this time
next year, we are confident that we shall have bred a new colour in a
well-known lovebird species. Here's hoping anyhow !
Flight No. 12
I keep my four pairs of Masked Lovebirds (. Agapornis personata) in
this flight. With the exception of one hen, which is a so-called yellow
Masked, the other seven birds are split-blues and are exceptional
breeders. I am not enamoured with the looks of a blue personata but

I am able to use the blue as a good bargaining item when exchanging
birds. With the exception of the yellow Masked each pair has bred
twice this year.
Flight No. 14
My pair of Senegal Parrots (. Poicephalus senegalus) are quite matey
but do not appear to have any desire to breed. As these birds were
recently imported I have not given up hope.
Flight No. 15
This flight is reserved for a pair of Brown-headed Parrots (. Poicephalus
cryptoxanthus) but is used at the moment to house the youngsters bred
in other flights.
Flight No. ij
My pair of African Greys ( Psittacus erithacus) have mated and I am
now giving them a suitable nest. Perhaps too late to breed this year
but one never knows.
Any readers who wish to exchange ideas with me are cordially invited
to write me (Aiken Lodge, Orange Road, Newlands, Gape, S.A.), and
who knows, we may be able to exchange some stock in the future.

It is now a year since I have retired and dispersed my bird collection
at Los Angeles. I cannot say that I do not sometimes regret my aviaries
there, or the museums I directed for nine years. My little garden was a
great pleasure, and in Southern California one can grow in the open
practically all the species of plants one sees in cold and temperate
houses elsewhere, and any birds, including the most delicate ones,
could be kept outdoors all the year round. It all was fun, but the
page has been turned on that part of my life. My present situation has
obvious advantages : I have much more time to enjoy Cleres and its
innumerable birds, to travel and to visit friends all over the world.
There still are wonderful private collections of birds in the United
States, in England, in France, and elsewhere, which it is always a
delight to visit. We hear too little about them because their owners
have not enough time for writing, which is most unfortunate.

Cleres, 1961
As I am now planning to spend a couple of winter months in
California and two or three in New York, the collections at Cleres have
been considerably increased in the course of the present year, particu-
larly those of small birds. The principal outdoor aviaries have been
done up, the greenhouse transformed and replenished. There are a good
many indoor cages as well. Among the new birds, are a dozen
Humming Birds, brought from Brazil by Dr. E. Beraut ; Sunbirds,
Sugar-birds, and various insectivorous and fruit-eating birds, so that
it looks much as in previous years. The collection of doves brought
from Los Angeles is excellent and the following species have bred :
Crested, Bronze-wing, Martinique Quail, Grey-headed (G. caniceps ),
Philippine Pheasant-tailed, Blue Ground (Claravis pretiosa), Talpacoti,
Pygmy, Peruvian, Silver Diamond, etc. There are now in the central
outdoor aviary a pair of Inca Terns, very tame and pretty, as well as
Cotton Teal and African Pygmy Geese. Mr. Ed. Boehm has sent us
various Sugar-birds and Barbets, including the charming Eubucco
bourcieri from Colombia, green above, yellow below, with red head
and a light-blue nuchal collar. We have five species of Touracous :
Knysna, Scleutti's, White-eared, Pink-crested, and Ross. A number of
Macaws are flying free, others being caged, particularly Lear's,
Hyacinthine and the Golden-green ambiguus which resembles the
Military, but is larger and yellower. We have two species of Screamers
and a Cariama. Game birds are numerous and include, Congo
Peacocks and Brush Turkeys (loaned by the Antwerp Zoo), Black and
Plumed Guinea-fowl, and White Eared Pheasants. The waterfowl
collection is almost up to the pre-war standard, second only to that at
the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge.
This has been a poor breeding year because of the warm winter and
cold spring which have upset the birds, resulting in suppressed clutches
or clear eggs in many cases. However, we reared a number of Rheas,
one Stanley Crane, some geese, ducks, and pheasants, and a Brazilian
Curassow. A number of new pens and aviaries, as well as a deer park,
will be renovated during the next winter.
England
I was, for a few weeks, in England in April and again in August.
Besides Whipsnade, now much improved, and the excellent Chester
Zoo, I had the great pleasure of visiting several very good collections.
My old friend Captain R. de Q. Quincey has in Herefordshire the
best collection of Humming Birds, Sunbirds, Sugar-birds, Tanagers,
and various small Softbills to be seen in Europe, excellently housed in
beautiful greenhouses and planted outdoor aviaries. The garden is
lovely and it all is arranged with great taste. The aviaries are not over-
crowded, a very rare feature in the world of aviculture, although the

numbers of species represented is large. Among the Hummers, are
such rarities as Heavenly Sylphs and a Giant (Patagona gigas ), and a
pair of Purple-bellied Sunbirds (.Nectarinia purpureiventris) probably
represent the finest species of the whole family.
At Lower Haselor, near Evesham, Worcestershire, Mr. R. Partridge
has a very large collection of birds, extremely well installed and kept.
It consists mostly of parrots and parrakeets, many of which are success-
fully reared each year. During the last few years the number of
aviaries has been increased considerably. Besides Psittacines,
Mr. Partridge keeps many species of doves and a number of other
small birds. I was delighted to visit him again and to find that he has
one of the outstanding collections of the world.
I took much pleasure in seeing again this year, as I did last autumn,
the excellent collections of waterfowl and other birds of Mr. E. O.
Squire, at St. Neots, Huntingdonshire. The lovely garden which
surrounds the large enclosures adds much to the beauty of the place,
as do Formosan Deer and Dama Wallabies. The tame Occipital Blue
Pie, which usually flies free, was locked up this time during its moult.
Mr. Squire has a very complete collection of geese and ducks, and he
rears many of them.
The pheasants and other game birds in the Ornamental Pheasant
Trust collection are housed at Mr. Philip Wayre's farm at Great
Witchingham, Norwich, until another location can be found. The best
birds of the now dispersed Leckford collection are there, as well as such
rarities as Bornean Argus, Bornean Firebacks, White Eared Pheasants,
and Cabot's Tragopans. Three young of the latter species have been
reared, and also some Temminck's and Koklass. Mr. Wayre has an
assorted collection of mammals and a lot of waterfowl, one of the finest
in Europe.
Although it is a public garden, the " Birdland " of Mr. J. C. Hill,
at Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, should be mentioned here.
It is extremely well laid out and kept, and the birds look very attractive
among the trees and the flowers. There are many interesting species
represented ; I noticed particularly a pair of the very rare Swift
Parrakeets and some Great Black Cockatoos (Probosciger ). Free homing
Budgerigars are particularly charming in this comparatively small but
beautiful garden.
After more than twenty years, I have seen again the Paignton Zoo,
where I was so often in the past the guest of my late friend Herbert
Whitley. The zoo itself is much as he left it and very well stocked. The
tropical house is still lush with tropical vegetation ; the excellent
parrot house, and many indoor aviaries are well kept and contain many
good birds.
Before leaving Europe, I should state that the Paris Zoo has now
quite a good collection of birds, both at Vincennes and at the old

Jardin des Plantes which Professor Nouvel is trying to revive. An old in-
door domed cage (which, in my childhood, used to house a Rhino !) has
been very successfully transformed into a large and high aviary. Three
Purple-headed Glossy Starlings (Lamprocolius purpuratus) have produced
three young, and a pair of Crowned Pigeons is sitting on a nest of twigs
which they built high up on a dead tree. At Vincennes, five flamingoes
of three different forms have been reared (European, American, and
Chilean), as well as five Black-necked and three Whooper Swans.

Aviculture is flourishing in America, in both public and private
establishments.
Among the zoos there are several wonderful collections managed
by highly-skilled curators. I can only mention a very few, with which
I am particularly familiar. In New York, Mr. W. Conway, now the
Director of the Bronx Zoo, has been remarkably successful. To mention
only a few facts, he has successfully captured and brought home from
the high Andes of Bolivia twenty Jameson's Flamingoes and some
Andean, two species never before seen in captivity. He has also kept
for several years the difficult Puffin. Under his supervision, many
unusual birds have been kept and reared.
Mr. J. Griswold, at Philadelphia, has also been extremely success-
ful, particularly in breeding Cranes, Flamingoes, and waterfowl, as
well as Inca Terns, Motmots, and Crested Barbets (T. coffer) and in
keeping many difficult small waders. The Philadelphia bird house is
the finest now existing.
Mr. K. C. Lint, at San Diego, and F. Stark, at San Antonio have
also been conspicuously successful, and a Humming Bird was reared
last year at Cleveland.
Among the innumerable amateurs, I can only mention now some of
my close friends.
At Elberon, New Jersey, Mrs. M. Erlanger has several beautiful and
well kept aviaries where she keeps small and medium-sized birds,
mostly softbills. She has many rare species, and, last year, she reared
a Knysna Touracou, several Colombian Red Cardinals ( R . phoenicea ),
Buff-naped and Silver-throated Tanagers ( Tanagra ruficervix and T.
icterocephala ).
Mr. Ed. Boehm possesses near Trenton, New Jersey, the richest
private collection of birds now in existence anywhere in the world.
It is beautifully housed in a long building with many indoor cages and
aviaries, and in numerous outdoor flights, some very large, carefully
laid out and planted. There are some parrots, pheasants, and water-
fowl, but the most remarkable of his birds belong to the softbills and
fruit-eaters, of which he has tremendous numbers. The aviaries are
so vast that a number of Sunbirds live together in them without

fighting, a state of things that I had never witnessed before. There are
also Humming Birds. The series of Tanagers, of Sugar-birds, of small
and large insect-eaters, and of many other small birds is wonderful.
There are many flycatchers, including the Paradise. Of the larger
birds I noticed several species of Touracous, Barbets, Toucans,
Starlings, and Thrushes and a few Birds of Paradise. But it is idle to
try to mention them all. Many breeding successes have taken place.
Mr. Boehm has most originally and cleverly solved the problem of
sheltering his birds from the severe winter weather. Each autumn he
completely covers his flights with plastic material, thus changing them
into vast greenhouses, heated by hot-water pipes. The plastic cover
is removed in the spring.
No fewer than five attendants care for the birds. Mr. Boehm is
famous as a maker of excellent and elaborate birds figures, appreciated
all over the world. He is a most enthusiastic aviculturist.
In California, Mr. W. J. Sheffler, at Los Angeles, still has many
parrakeets, francolins, and quails, and a number of small birds, among
which the exquisite Rosita's Bunting, a very rare bird from Southern
Mexico, blue above and pink underneath, never before seen in
aviaries, which has been privately collected for him.
Mr. Ray Thomas, at Bel Air, has one of the very large world
collections of parrots, parrakeets, and of small and medium-sized birds.
One vast, planted aviary is full of Touracous, Rollers, Drongos, Jays,
Magpies, Babblers, Toucans, Thrushes, etc., a wonderful sight.
Another one contains hundreds of Tanagers, Sugar-birds, Trogons,
small Barbets, and insectivorous birds of all sorts. A third one shelters
many finches and other seed-eaters. Mr. Thomas only tries to rear
parrakeets. A pair of imported blue-tinged Indian Ringnecks last year
produced five pure blue young birds.
Mr. M. Straun, at Northridge, has large aviaries with a few score
pheasants, waterfowl, and a magnificent series of pigeons and doves.
He has reared many of them, including a number of Imperial Fruit
Pigeons. In a large covered patio, he has a charming aviary of Tanagers,
Sugar-birds, and other softbills, among tropical plants.
At Paramount is the excellent waterfowl collection of Mr. W. J.
Parsonson, who also keeps doves, junglefowl, and Tinamous. He
has been especially successful with Orinoco and Andean Geese, Black
Swans, Andean Crested Ducks, Sharp-winged, and Laysan Teal. His
triumph was the rearing, in i960, of a Kelp Goose, a very difficult
marine species.
Mr. H. Rudkin, continuing his father's work, keeps a tremendous
number of birds at Fillmore, between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara,
in the middle of his orange grove. He is well known for his great
collection of parrots and parrakeets, the largest in America, and his
breeding successes are considerable ; last year, for example, three

hybrid Blue and Yellow X Military Macaws, and some seventeen
Grey Parrots, were hatched in an incubator and hand reared. But
there are also Flamingoes, Black and Black-necked Swans, ducks and
geese, Trumpeters, Cranes, Peafowl, Peacock Pheasants, many pigeons
and doves, including Crowned Pigeons, as well as small birds, both
seed eaters and softbills. A truly magnificant collection.
In the San Francisco area, Mr. and Mrs. Eric Kinsay, the veteran
experts of difficult local birds, now keep only about thirty cage-birds,
having disposed of their large aviaries. Mr. A. Isenberg still has one of
the great world collections of fruit-eating and insectivorous birds,
which include Birds of Paradise, Touracous, Sunbirds, Humming
Birds, and Cocks of the Rock. The Golden Tanager (Tanagra arthus
aurulenta ) has often bred in his greenhouse. Red and Lesser Birds of
Paradise have nested unsuccessfully these last two years.
Two excellent professional breeders should be mentioned here as
they have been unusually successful for a number of years. One, Mr. F.
Strange, at Redondo Beach, has reared annually hundreds of franco-
lins, quails, and partridges, many for the first time in captivity. Among
the rarest can be mentioned the Indian Spurfowl, and two species of
Bush Quails. The other one, Mr. J. W. Steinbeck, at Concord, has
been for thirty years a most excellent breeder of pigeons, doves, finches,
Tragopans, Monals, and Peacock Pheasants.
To return to eastern North America, I would like to mention the
magnificent pheasantry of Mr. and Mrs. W. Oakie, at Winston Salem,
North Carolina. Their collection of pheasants is the largest and finest
in the world at present, and they have been extremely successful with
them.
Near Miami, Parrot Jungle, a show place, is quite remarkable.
It is a beautiful, very well kept tropical park, with a large collection of
parrots, most of them free flying. Macaws predominate, and they are
trained to return to individual cages to feed and to sleep. Many have
bred there, and one sees dozens of hybrids of all colours, the result of
crossing and recrossing of four species : Blue and Red, Blue and Yellow,
Green-winged Red, and Military. Rarer species are kept in aviaries,
and there is also a flamingo pond.
Probably the best, and certainly the most nicely kept collection of
waterfowl in America belongs to my friend Dillon Ripley, at Litchfield,
Connecticut. He has a lake and several ponds, fed by streams, and
most species are represented there. He was successful this year with
Nenes and Laysan Teal, as well as with many other geese and ducks.
Reeves's Muntjacs and Dama Wallabies share the birds' enclosure.
I hope these notes, made at random, will show our members that
there are many fine collections of birds, all over the world, of which
little is known, because little is written about them. I hope this will
induce them to be less secretive about their own.

By J. C. Laidlay (Perth, Scotland)
Last year I thought it might be a worthwhile experiment to rear
a few Mandarin and leave them full-winged.
In Scotland we have few slow-running streams or old trees with
suitable holes in them for nesting in. This makes conditions quite
different here to that in the south of England, where, as we all know,
Mandarin are thriving in a wild state. In due course four pairs were
flying in and out of our garden and on to the River Tay, which runs
past the garden. This state continued all through the winter. By
early spring the birds were busy hunting all the neighbouring trees
for nesting sites ; unfortunately two drakes had paired together, but
one drake paired with two ducks. The first casualty was the death of
a drake from starvation ; it, in the search for nesting sites, had gone
down the chimney of a shed in our ground. I only found it by chance
when I happened to look into the building and then saw him dead
on the floor and with him two very thin ducks, as this was the drake
who paired with two ducks ; however, they did in time recover.
Next a drake was seen on the chimney-pot of a nearby empty cottage ;
he, too, must have died and possibly his duck with him. We had hung
some boxes fairly high up and there were all the nesting-boxes in
the garden, none of which they used. One duck we saw had made
use of one of the high-up boxes, she hatched out five young which
were seen at various stages of growth on the river. A second duck
must have found a nesting site, as another brood of four was seen on
the river. About a month ago (in July) two drakes returned to the
garden and remained there. As I expected, two must have died. Then
shortly after them a duck came in to stay, so she must have either had
her eggs taken or lost her young. Now at the time of writing these
notes (August, 1961) the two last year's drakes and two last year's
ducks are staying in the garden and four young ones, bred on the river,
are also with them. Possibly there is still a duck and brood on the river.
This has been a bad year for chances of birds rearing their young,
as it was exceptionally dry and cold, with very late frosts, so little
fly on the water. It does show, however, that Mandarin would hold
their own in Scotland if they could find suitable nesting quarters.
I might add that we have resident otters on this stretch of the river,
several Carrion Crows and flocks of Jackdaws.

NON-DETERMINANT LAYING AND ARTIFICIAL REARING
AT THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99756508" page_id="56315838"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
By William G. Conway and Joseph Bell
While captive collections have recorded increasingly successful
breeding results with shore birds in recent years, it appears that the
1961 rearing of Oriental Pratincoles, Glareola maldivaram , at the New
York Zoological Park, is a " first breeding 55 .
This paper presents evidence for non-determinant laying by the
Oriental Pratincole and records, for the first time, an incubation period.
The aviculture of the captive breeding and rearing is described.
Male and female pratincoles were received on 10th June, 1959. Both
birds were soon observed to undergo a pre-basic moult (moult nomen-
clature that of Humphrey and Parkes, Auk 76 (1) : 1--31, 1959),
leading to an eclipse or basic plumage lacking the characteristic
pectoral necklace. This plumage was followed by a pre-alternate
moult in which the pale gular coloration and pectoral necklace
appeared during January of i960. An " eclipse " does not seem to have
been previously reported for this bird.
Again, in January of 1961, the alternate or breeding plumage
appeared, and although no courtship, display behaviour, or territorial-
ism was observed, the female fashioned an unlined nest scrape in one
corner of the group exhibit in which the birds were housed, and
deposited an egg on 28th March. The pratincoles were immediately
removed to an off-exhibit breeding cage where they deposited, in
the next forty-seven days, fifteen more eggs.
All eggs were removed from the nest as soon as discovered, and
incubated artificially. The Table below records the course of the

W. G. CONWAY AND J. BELL-THE ORIENTAL PRATINCOLE 1 95
From the Table it will be seen that the most frequent interval
between the deposition of eggs was two days (seven cases), but that
intervals of one day occurred in three instances, three days in two
instances, and four days in two instances. A clutch pattern is not evident
from the Table so that, in this case, the Oriental Pratincole behaved as
a non-determinant layer.
All of the eggs were set, immediately upon discovery, in a forced-
draught incubator which was maintained at 98* rb * 5* F- Hygrometer
readings varied from 84* F. to 88* F. during incubation, and each egg
was turned at least four times daily. Experimentation has demonstrated
that the eggs of Killdeers (Charadrius v. vocifereus) hatch normally under
these conditions at the twenty-five to twenty-six-day natural incubation
period. This the 18 * 7-day incubation period averaged from the Table
above is believed normal. All fertile unbroken eggs hatched. The
only other recorded incubation period for a pratincole of which we are
aware, twenty-one days, was recorded by W. MacGillvray (j Emu,
24 : 81-85, x 9 2 4 ) for Stiltia Isabella, a somewhat larger species. The
surprising spread in incubation periods from 17 +/- * 5 days to 21 * 5 days
may not be so random, as a first glance indicates. Evidence worthy of
further investigation is accumulating in our records, suggestive that the
last laid eggs of some Gharadriiform birds may require a shorter incuba-
tion period than the first eggs of the clutch !
Eight young pratincoles were reared successfully in brooders. The
chicks were fed, by hand, a mixture of fresh fish and meat, supplemented
with Vi-Penta, the first few days. Soon, within eight days, most were
picking readily for themselves and taking the usual insectivorous food
fed their parents. One chick weighed 5*8 gms. at hatching, 6-6 gms.
at three days, and 11 gms. at seven days.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
What we believe to be the first breeding record in captivity of the
King Eider (Somateria spectabilis ) occurred at Slimbridge this season.
The species has been represented in our collection since 1955. The
original bird, a fine adult drake blown on to the deck of a fishing
trawler, was caught and taken to Reykjavik Museum where our good
friend Dr. Finnur Gudmundsson, finding the bird quite tame and
prepared to feed, decided it had a good chance of surviving the air
journey to Slimbridge. Subsequently, through the kindness of the
Copenhagen Zoo, the only known female in captivity was sent over to
keep our lone male company. Later a further two pairs were added
from the same source.
The main concern was to establish the eiders in their unusual
surroundings and to supply an adequate diet to bring these magnificent
birds successfully through the moult. Over the past few years a great
deal of display and pairing had taken place, but no attempt to nest had
been made. However, in early June this year a female was found
sitting on a small indentation she had made on the short grass in our
Rushy Pen. The scrape was a rough affair into which sub-surface
clinker protruded, so much so that one feared for the safety of the
eggs--indeed the first egg sustained a cracked shell. In consequence a
further lining of protective grass was added to the scrape when the duck
was away feeding. Two eggs were laid the first day and a third and
fourth on the following two days. These, when thinking of eiders,
seemed small, pale olive in colour, less green than those of the Common
Eider, and pointed in shape ; they measured 65 mm. by 43 mm. and
averaged some 68 gms. weight. The down was pale fawn in colour and
scanty in amount when compared with other species.
The eggs were incubated by a Rhode Island bantam. Three were
fertile and pipped after twenty-two days. The first duckling hatched
on the twenty-third day.
The incubation period of the King Eider has not hitherto been
recorded. This is four to five days less than the period of the Common
Eider. The newly hatched young differ considerably from those of the
Common Eider. The down is a light brown above, with pale fawn on
the underparts. The cheeks are pale with a dark sub-orbital stripe.
An unknown and striking feature is that the bill is pink, tipped with
slate grey, although at the end of a week the pink had almost
completely disappeared. The head and bill do not give the impression
of being wedge shaped as in the case of Somateria mollissima. The down
continues from the forehead over the top third of the culmen. The
tarsus is typical and slate grey in colour.

The following foods were offered--mosquito larvae, fresh-water
shrimp, maggots, chopped liver, ants' eggs, chopped egg, starter
crumbs, minced eel, bread crumbs, chopped earthworms, dried shrimp,
fish meal, and wheat germ meal. The bantam was a most attentive
parent and continually dropped shrimp and morsels of food in front of
the ducklings. But for the first four days no efforts on her part, or
indeed ours, could persuade the ducklings to feed. Occasionally,
through the unending efforts of the bantam, they would take a peck at
gammarus, but it was not until the fifth day that one duckling
commenced to feed freely on shrimp and the meal mixture. After
another day, a second bird was feeding. At a week one duckling died,
but both the remaining two started to eat the shrimp and larvae in
quantity and after ten days were tucking into a mash of fish meal, dried
milk, wheat germ, and turkey starter crumbs.
Feathering commenced at fourteen days and at a month the birds
were virtually fully feathered. The plumage is of a lighter brown than
the Common Eider and the sexes are similar at this age, though at the
time of writing, when the birds are three months old, the male's bill is
developing a pinkish hue and the tail feathers are prominent.

By J. J. Yealland
One species and two sub-species new to the collection have been
received during the past two months. These are Schrank's Tanager
(\0x25A0Calospiza schranki), Spengel's Parrotlet [For pus passer inus spengeli ), and
Caribbean Bananaquit ( Coerebaflaveola luteola ).
Schrank's Tanager inhabits the upper Amazonian area--south-
eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, western Peru, western Brazil, and
northern Bolivia. Spengel's Parrotlet is a native of the dry region of
Santa Marta, Colombia. The most noticeable feature of the male is the
pale blue rump. Coereba flaveola ranges over a large part of tropical and
sub-tropical South America, Central America and islands in the
Caribbean area, over thirty races being recognized. The food consists
of small spiders, insects, and the nectar from flowers, the birds being
particularly fond of sweet foods. Writing on the Bananaquit of Tobago
(Wilson Bulletin , 50, 1958), Alfred O. Gross states that the presence of
nectar-bearing flowers is a factor in determining its distribution and
local abundance. In cases where the nectar cannot be reached in the
ordinary way, the Bananaquit pierces the corolla near the base. The
sap of sugar cane is eaten whenever the occasion offers. On Tobago,
where they are also known as the Sucrier or Sugar Bird, the
Bananaquits come to verandahs or the open dining rooms of hotels in

order to eat sugar from bowls or undissolved sugar from cups, taking it
even when the guests are still seated at the tables and coming regularly
at tea-time for this purpose. They also enter bars in order to sip
liqueur left in glasses. Gross says, " At the Blue Haven Hotel I saw
five Bananaquits at one time so engaged and the bartender informed
me that the birds visited him at all times of the day to obtain the
# exhilarating 5 fluid. However, I never detected any unusual behaviour
on the part of the birds after such indulgence."
Other arrivals of especial interest are three Boatbills ( Cochlearius
c. cochlearius ), two Black-crowned Night Herons ( Nycticorax n. hoactli ),
two Little Blue Herons (. Florida caerulea) in the white immature plum-

Evidence of the great interest that is being taken by Australian
aviculturists in the Neophema group is the fact that at the 1961 Annual
Exhibition organized by the Avicultural Society of South Australia
there were no less than ninety-nine entries staged by eighteen
exhibitors. All species, with the exception of the Orange-bellied which
is totally protected, were on show.

The Spur-winged Goose (Plectropterus gambensis) has been success-
fully reared at the Caribbean Gardens, South-west Florida. Early in
May, i960, a nest of seven eggs was found. These were placed in an
incubator and on the thirtieth day two hatched ; the other five were
infertile.
Marvin C. Cecil, Curator of Birds, is to be congratulated on his
outstanding success in fully rearing the two young ones--both have
proved to be males. Julius Fleischmann, owner of the Gardens, thus
has the honour of recording an American first breeding success.

Dr. H. D. Groen, Groningen, Holland, reports a very satisfactory
breeding season, 1961. " Six Kings, all hand-reared and very tame ;
three Crimson-winged ; six Barraband's ; seven Princess of Wales's ;
twenty Pale-headed Rosellas ; three Pennant's ; one Red-rumped ;
four Bourkes ; three Splendids ; one Elegant. The four pairs of
Turquoisines have been very prolific, last year rearing thirty-six
young in two broods and this year twenty-eight, again in two broods.
Red-rumped were used as foster-parents and fully reared one Mealy
Rosella, two Bourkes, and one Red-rumped, all in the same nest."

Dr. J. R. Hodges writes : " My pair of Blue-winged Grass Parra-
keets, about which I wrote in the September-October, 1960, number
of the Magazine, have nested twice and produced another seven
youngsters this year. One of the young birds developed a growth in its
neck and had to be destroyed but the other six are fine specimens and
appear to be three cocks and three hens. A young pair of Turquoisine
Parrakeets laid fourteen eggs in three clutches, hatched them all but
succeeded in rearing to maturity only one of the chicks. Blue-faced
Parrot-Finches laid several eggs but took no further interest in them."

In the last number of the Magazine (page 165), Professor Carl
Naether queried if and when the Splendid or Scallop-necked Pigeon
(Columba speciosa ) had been reared in the United States. According to
my records the Professor's success would appear to be a " first " not
only for the United States but for anywhere.
The only record for C. speciosa concerns a hybrid with a female
American Spotted Pigeon (C. maculosa). Jean Dalacour reared three
young ones of this cross in 1915 and two in 1916, and writes : " these
pigeons have never ceased to nest for over a year, and I have at present
five hybrids, three of which are adults " (see Avicult. Mag., 1916,

Sir Crawford McCullagh, Bt., in reporting the parrakeet breeding
results, 1961, at Lismara, says : " They are very disappointing, but
with so little sunshine and two nights of heavy frost on the 27th and
28th May, I am afraid there were many dead chicks in the nests."
The following young were reared : three Ring-necked, parents blue
cock and yellow hen ; three Ring-necked, parents blue cock and
green hen ; three Yellow-bellied ; ten Yellow-rumped ; three
Pennant's ; one Bauer's ; three Rock Pebblers ; three Princess of

The Edward Marshall Boehm aviaries. Charles Everitt reports :
" I really thought that we had come to the end of the breeding season
with the arrival of September but such is not to be. Actually we have
had, and are still having, a real Indian summer this month, way up
in the 90's, and it is decidely better than was August. The birds must
have sensed its coming for several have started nest building once
more. I think we will finish up with quite a creditable performance.

What we regard as the best is having six young Bengal Pittas. They
are getting on well but, unfortunately, we lost the breeding male to
a rat. In some ways I guess that a breeding hen is more valuable but
it is a shame that the pair is split now. I feel sure that at least two of
the young ones are males so we can use one of them next year.
Needless to say all the young are divided up, one to an aviary, for
I was not taking any chances with them. I don't know, but I think
that this must be the first breeding anywhere in captivity. I think
the same applies to the Sulphury Tyrants from which we have one
independant youngster, now four months old ; and the parents have
just gone to nest again.
So far this year we have sixteen different species with independant
young, one other with chicks in the nest and four others with eggs in
the nest. These last include the Bonaparte Euphonia and the Fairy
Blue Wren. We also have Tacazze's building."

As a result of recent negotiations with the Trade Unions, a shorter
working week and an increase in basic rates of pay came into operation
in the printing trade during September. Due to these and other
changes, the cost of producing the Magazine has risen by no less than
40 per cent in the last two years. Every subscription is now of added
importance to the Society. Will all members please bear this in mind.

A most detailed account of the behaviour of the Black-tailed Godwit,
based on long and painstaking observation and experiment. Reactions
to predators, intraspecific fighting, courtship, and sexual behaviour,
parental care, the behaviour of chicks, both before and after hatching,
and territorial behaviour are described in great detail and discussed at
length. Some shorter but equally important observations are made on
feeding and other behaviour not specifically related to the breeding
season.
This monograph is not exactly light reading and the lay reader may
at times feel that the Godwit as a living fellow-creature is being
obscured rather than spotlighted by the technical descriptions of its
actions. But he should persevere since the mass of accurate information

Incubation Period of the North American Ruddy Duck ( Oxyura jamaicensis
jamaicensis)

<bodyText confidence="0.98578" page_id="56315850"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
I have kept the above attractive little Stifftail in my waterfowl collection for
the past eight years. During that period with the exception of the first year, the
species has regularly laid two clutches of eggs each season, varying from six to ten.
I have incubated the eggs under bantams and latterly allowed the duck to incubate
herself, after it was found that artificial rearing was not successful.
On every occasion careful records have shown that the incubation period is twenty-
four days. I have also confirmed this with a fellow collector who keeps the same
species. In Delacour's Waterfowl of the World , vol. 3, p. 228, the incubation period of
O. jamaicensis jamaicensis is given as twenty to twenty-one days.
Whilst hesitating to differ in opinion with such undoubted authority, it would be
interesting to know whether other collectors keeping the species in question share my
experience.
If the evidence is strong enough and my experience is not isolated, then I think
the record should be amended, if only for the benefit of those less experienced who
may acquire the Stifftail in question in later years and use the reference I have
quoted.

Notes on the 1960-61 Breeding Season at Gippsland, Victoria, Australia
The 1960-61 breeding season was only a moderately fair one ; as my results show.
Red-rumped Parrakeet.--Nine, five cocks and four hens.
Golden-mantled Rosella.--One, a hen. The father, a magnificent bird, had only
been trapped about nine weeks when his young hatched ; a second youngster died in
the nest.
Red Rosella.--One, a hen. The parents of this youngster were only a year old
when they went to nest. Four more youngsters died in the nest. The cock bird is of
the Tasmanian sub-species, diemenensis ! I think. I'm not sure yet.
Many-coloured Parrakeet.--One, a cock. Reared by the hen alone after the sudden
death of the cock bird. Some eggs placed under Gockatiel but the young were not fed.
Port Lincoln Parrakeet X Mallee Parrakeet.--Two hybrids, a pair.
Pale-headed Rosella.--Two clutches of clear eggs.
Turquoisine Parrakeet.--After the death of the cock bird the three newly-hatched
young died, probably from cold.
Yellow Rosella.--Another unsuccessful pair; eggs were broken by a Crimson Rosella,
and the hen did not incubate further. The surviving eggs placed under other hens,
one hatched, but was promptly killed.
Adelaide Rosella X Crimson Rosella.--One, a hen. An Adelaide cock mated to
a Crimson Rosella hen after his own hen died with cerebral haemorrhage. Eggs were
laid but the hen was a bad sitter and she reared nothing ; but two eggs placed under
another hen resulted in one young being reared.

Yellow Rosella X Crimson Rosella.--Synthetic Adelaide. Sharing the Yellow
Rosella aviary was a Crimson Rosella hen, she laid five eggs two of which were fertile,
they hatched but were not reared.
Cockatiel.--Four, of equal sex. One was reared partly by a pair of Budgerigars,
finished by hand. This pair of Cockatiels refused to rear Many-coloured young.
Blue-wing Parrakeet.--Five, two cocks and three hens. First clutch of seven eggs,
all hatched, but because of the smallness of the nest-box, and abnormal heat, five
were lost at point of leaving nest. Second clutch four eggs, all fertile, three hatched,
one young crushed other two reared. A second pair reared one.
Peach-faced Lovebird.--Three, two cocks and a hen.
Budgerigar.--Many Budgerigars of the common varieties including the wild green
type. These birds are mainly kept for experiments in fostering.
Indian Lace-necked Dove.--One, sex unknown. Was given away as soon as it
could fend for itself.

REARING EIDER DUCKS FROM IMPORTED EGGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.930719166666667" page_id="56315851"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
I imported from Iceland ten European Eider Duck eggs and they arrived at
London Airport at the end of May. I had to get an import licence from the Ministry
of Agriculture but this was no trouble although it took a few weeks for the actual
approval to come through.
Two good broody hens were selected and they were given five eggs each. Towards
the end of incubation I had only four fertile eggs which were put under one hen only.
Hatching occurred on the twenty-fifth day, but the eggs were cracked two days
before that and the ducklings inside made a lot of noise !
The hen and four ducklings were moved to a coop and ran on the lawn. One
duckling died when it was about eight hours old but the other three have never
looked back and are now in their first feathers and seem to be good strong healthy
birds.
They were fed on Turkey starter crumbs, dried flies, insectivorous food, and
fish meal. Fresh water at all times which had to be changed often as they spent a lot
of time washing themselves in it.
At three weeks of age they were gradually weaned on to Turkey starter crumbs only.
Now, on the advice of Mr. J. O. D'eath, they are fed in the same way as he described
in the Avicultural Magazine, vol. 64, number 6.
At six weeks they were put in a wire netting enclosure beside my main pond--the
netting being gradually expanded so as to include deeper water.
Upon reflection I gather I was lucky to hatch four ducklings from the original
ten eggs. Also I am sure the excellent weather during the first few weeks of rearing
was a real help.
