FOR 1914-1915.
tT is with a feeling of great satisfaction that the Council has to
report that another most successful year has just closed for our
Society. The volume now completed forms the Sixth of the Third
Series, and is the Twenty-first issued by the Society. Now that it
has attained its majority, we feel confident that all its members
will do their utmost to help the Society, so that it may continue to
progress along the path it has always followed.
This last volume will be found quite up to the standard, both
in size and quality of its contents to any of its predecessors, and it
is this fact which calls for special thankfulness, for in this time of
stress and anxiety, when so many of our contemporaries have had
to be very much reduced, or have been forced to disappear altogether,
we have been able to give our members their usual monthly magazine.
How much this happy state of affairs is due to the unceasing efforts
of our untiring Editor perhaps the majority of our members scarcely
realize, for only those who see the actual production of a monthly
magazine like ours know the continual strain and labour which it
entails.
The Council would like to call special attention to the article
on the scope of the Magazine, by our Editor in the September issue,

for only by the loyal support of our members can we hope to con-
tinue our useful work as heretofore.
The members of the Council tender their grateful thanks to
all who have contributed to the welfare of our Society during the
past year.
Signed for the Council,
T. H. Newman,
Hon. Business Secretary.

The Society&amp;apos;s Medal.
The Society's Medal.
RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding.in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish such
evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The Medal
will he awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough
to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall 1
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures 2^ inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894."
On the reverse is the following inscription : "Awarded to (name of recipient)
for rearing the young of [name of species), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom."

THE BROWN THRASHER, OR THRUSH.
Harporliynchus rufus.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Range. Eastern North America : breeds from the Gulf States to
Manitoba, Maine, and Montreal: winters from Virginia south-
ward.
Nest, of twigs, coarse rootlets, and leaves, lined with finer rootlets,
in bushes, thickets, or on the ground.
Eggs, three to six, bluish white or greyish white ; thickly, evenly,
and minutely speckled with cinnamon or rufous-brown.
1.08 X .80. [Chapman : " Birds of Eastern North America."]
Mr. Chapman writes that this bird " is generally speaking an
" inhabitant of the undergrowth, where it passes much time on the
"ground, foraging among the fallen leaves."
" He is an active suspicious bird, who does not like to be
" watched, and expresses his annoyance with an unpleasant kissing
" note, or sharply whistled wheeu."
But he seeks an exposed position when singing.
" Morning and evening he mounts his favourite perch--
" generally in the upper branches of a tree--and deliberately gives
" his entire attention to his song. He is a finished musician, and
" although his repertoire is limited to one air, he rivals the Mocking -
" bird in the richness of his tones and execution."
Audubon was greatly impressed by the Brown Thrasher's
song, for he wrote : "No sooner has the bird reached its destined

" abode, than, whenever a fair morning occurs, it mounts the topmost
" twig of a detached tree, and pours forth its loud richly varied and
" highly melodious song. It is impossible," he added, " to convey
" the charms of the full song of the Brown Thrush ; you must go to
" its own woods and there listen to it. The actions of this species

"during the period of courtship are very curious, the male often
" strutting before the female with its tail trailing on the ground,
" moving gracefully round her, in the manner of some pigeons."
It is of special interest to aviculturists to read Audubon's
words, where he writes " They breed well in aviaries, and are quite
" tractable in a closer state of confinement. In cages it sings well,
" and has much the movements of the Mocking-Bird, being full of
" activity, petulant, and occasionally apt to peck in resentment at
the hand which happens to approach it."
Audubon's friend Bachman wrote to him as follows concern-
ing a tame Brown Thrasher that he had : "So perfectly gentle did
this bird become, that when I opened its cage, it would follow me
" about the yard and garden. The instant it saw me take a spade
" or hoe, it would follow at my heels, and as I turned up the earth,
would pick up every insect or worm thus exposed. I kept it for
" three years, and its affection for me at last cost it its life. It
"usually slept on the back of my chair, in my study, and one night
" the door being accidently left open, it was killed by a cat."
The reproduction of the coloured plate was most kindly per-
mitted by the National Association of Audubon Societies, and was
originally published in " Bird-Lore." The Brown Thrasher is allied
to the Mocking Birds, and is not a true Thrush.

BIRD-KEEPING IN CHINA

By Alex. Hampe.
To keep birds in China is in many ways not as easy as in
Europe. There is first the climate which is changeable to the
extreme, viz. : very hot and damp during the summer months, and
rather cold, with sharp winds, from December until April.
The autumn is, however, delightful, and it is then when my
birds always look their best and happiest.

Further, the supply of foreign birds is very irregular. A
steamer from Australia or Singapore may bring some desirable
species, but the same bird might not be imported again for years
and it is of no use to give an order for certain birds to the dealers.
They are not as amiable or intelligent as our dealers at home who
will do their best to procure a bird which is not in stock and, of
\0x25A0course, periodicals such as the Avicultural Magazine or Die gefiederte
Welt do not exist in China.
The few bird and animal dealers of Shanghai visit the
arriving steamers and buy what they can get at a cheap price, while
the brightest coloured birds--often not the rarest--generally go to
Japan where they fetch a better price. Of native Chinese birds,
only the very few species, which John Chinaman keeps either for
song, or for fighting respectively for gambling, are usually available,
but to obtain the rarer species from Fokien or Szetchuen, is a task I
have found so far very difficult to accomplish. Even coloured plates
do not help much, as the distances in China are so large and the
transport from the interior of course very difficult. This will, let us
hope, soon become better, when China has more railways and the
connections between the provinces are improved. We may then
hope to obtain the lovely game-birds from Szetchuen and Thibet such
as the white and the blue Crossoptilon and Lophophorus Ihuysii, etc.
which up to now seem to be out of our reach.
The Chinese are in a way great bird fanciers, viz., their love
for birds goes as far as song and ability of talking and fighting is
concerned. The last provides to them an occasion for gambling of
which our eastern friends are only too fond.
Actually bred in captivity by the Chinese there are as far as
I know only two birds. Our yellow friend, the Canary, and the
Cormorant which is used for catching fish in the muddy lakes and
creeks round Scotchau. I have read that the blue Crossoptilon
pheasant is bred in captivity for its tail feathers, which in former
years were in great demand for the hats of the mandarins, but I
have my doubts, at least I have tried in vain, and offered what would
seem to a Chinaman an enormous price to the dealers who sell the
tail feathers. The principal birds kept by the Chinese are the follow-
ing: The White Eye ( Zosterops simplex), the Jay Thrush ( Garrulax

canorus ), the Crested Mynah ( Sturnus cristatellus) and the Mongolian
Lark ( A Lauda viongolica). The four are appreciated for their song,
while the fighting bird par excellence is the little Suthora Webbiana*
(I am sorry I do not know the English name), and secondly the
amiable Dyal bird, which besides his fighting capacity has also an
agreeable song.
The special favourite of the Chinaman seems to be the little
White Eye ( Zosterops simplex). He is kept in small neat bamboo
cages and fed on bean flour and hard-boiled eggs, and every day one
may see some Chinaman carrying the small cage with its inmate
gaily twittering its song&amp;apos;, while his master walks in his leisurely
manner through the busy streets of Shanghai. I have always kept
some White Eyes in my aviary and delightful little pets they make.
Always neat and smooth in appearance, tame and lively, and never
disturbing any of their companions. At present I have three
different kinds with me: two pairs of Zosterops simplex, the usual
cage-bird of the Chinese, one pair of Zosterops japonicus, and a
single cock of Zosterops erythropleurus, which kind is generally for
sale on the local bird-market in September. Of these Zosterops
erythropleurus is the best songster. My little bird frequently sits on
a high branch of the aviary and sings his song which is remarkably
loud for such a small bird, with wings hanging and quivering.
Curiously Ire takes no notice of the other White Eyes, but keeps
friendship with a single Australian Waxbill (CEgintha temporalis).
I have never succeeded to breed the White Eyes. The
Japanese pair carried nesting material about for some time, but
that was all. Probably my failure is due to the fact that too many
different birds are kept in my aviary. Given a separate compart-
ment, with plenty of green shrubs to which White Eyes would not
do the least harm, these birds should probably breed successfully.
The Chinese Thrush, the Hooamee of the Chinese, is the bird
of the poor Chinaman. Annually large numbers are brought to our
market in very small cages where the poor birds can hardly turn
round. One will then see mafus (grooms), gardeners, etc. stand
before a pile of these cages and try to select a suitable good bird
which will cost about two shillings. If the owner is lucky and

picks a good singer, he will be able to sell his bird later on for
twenty shillings or even thirty shillings, but only on rare occasions
will a Chinaman part with a really good bird. The Hooamee is
generally kept in a neat bamboo cage and fed on crushed rice.
Attached to the cage is a small wicker-box in which grasshoppers
and other insects are concealed in order that the bird may be pre-
sented with such a tasty morsel after a good performance. One
often sees several Chinese take their birds in the morning to a garden
or an open place where they hang the cages up in a tree. The
birds are then uncovered and a real singing competition starts, while
the owners listen attentively to the concert. I have never kept
Hooamees.
They cannot be put together with small birds and their song
is too loud for me, at least when the bird is caged up. I should
however think they would make a suitable bird for turning out in
Europe, as they are hardy birds and their song in a large park
must sound lovely.
The Mongolian Lark is a great favourite with the Chinese.
One often sees them in dome-shaped cages in public tea-houses and
restaurants where they are taken by their owners, so that they may
enjoy the song of their birds while drinking a cup of tea and having
a friendly gossip with a neighbour.
In the middle of the cage there is a small platform on which
the bird stands when singing its song, which to my taste is however
too loud and shrill. I once saw a perfect Albino of this lark in the
native city. The price asked for it was #5, but probably a serious
buyer would have bought the bird for less than half the money. A
good singing specimen costs however never less than 20/-.
The little Suthora is kept exclusively for fighting purposes.
Two friendly owners will put their birds together for a fight and bet
on one of them to win. The little birds fight desperately but do not
kill each other, and after a time one of them will try to escape, when
the adversary is removed. Of course the birds are trained for fight-
ing, when in freedom they are very sociable and peaceful birds. I
have never seen the Suthora in a Zoological Garden or private
collection in Europe- I have kept a pair in my aviary for a few weeks
and they proved very good and harmless companions to the other

inhabitants -- small finches, etc. Their plumage is very simple and
they have no song, but still their quaint and confiding ways make
them a desirable and interesting bird. My birds seemed to be
perfectly happy until spring came and they could hear the call of
their wild comrades from the garden; then they became very rest-
less and fluttered constantly against the wire-netting, so that finally
I gave them their freedom. Last year I found a pair of the large
Paradoxornis gularis --in my opinion a near relation to the small
Suthora -- in the bird-market. As they looked interesting birds,
although I cannot call them exactly beautiful, I bought them and
put them in a large garden aviary. They were quiet birds, equally
peaceful as their small cousins, but unfortunately they escaped
through a hole in the wire-netting only a week after they had come
into my possession.
The Mynah is never caught as an adult bird, but always taken
from the nest. They become very tame and attached to their
owners, whom they will follow like a dog. They have an agreeable
natural whistle and are certainly very clever in imitating the human
voice and tunes. I have seen a Mynah which talked as well as a
good parrot. I have never kept them, as some pairs nest regularly
in my garden where I can watch them better than when in an
aviary. At present a pair has its nest in a pigeon cote, and pigeons
and Mynahs seem to agree very well together.
The Dyal Bird is a lovely cage-bird and I can fully endorse
the interesting lines written in his praise in a number of last year's
magazine. It is, however, not advisable to keep him with smaller
birds together, as he is given to bullying the small companions. It
is difficult to find hens here. Last autumn I procured a bird which
moulted into a fine hen, but all my efforts to keep her with a very
tame and perfect cock proved in vain. Tne cock fought the hen
pertinaciously and certainly would have killed her if I had not
removed her from the cage. I let her fly away in spring, while the
cock lives now in freedom in the garden of a friend of mine, but
always comes back to the verandah to feed and to roost in his cage.
These are the principal birds kept by the Chinese. Of other
species one finds the following here in the market: The Ruby Throat
(Calliope camtschatcensis), the Bulbul ( Ixus sinensis ), the Blue Ely-

Probably no member of the Parrot tribe is more graceful or
beautiful than the little Lory, with the imposing name of Gharmo-
synopsis pulcliella or Eair Lory.
A gem of bright green and crimson, the breast marked across
by a band of golden dashes like marks of interrogation. Always
interesting with its vivacious impulsive movements, always on the
move as if ready for any fun that may present itself, it is at the
same time quite safe with other inmates of the aviary.
The pair I write about are in an aviary with Tanagers and
Sunbirds and have never shown any inclination to harm their
companions.
Just over five years ago I obtained these birds from New
Guinea, and though they have nested on several occasions, the one
egg they lay has always proved unfertile till this summer. I am
not sure what the period of incubation was, for after numerous
disappointments I ceased taking much interest in their domestic
affairs.
We found that there was a young bird in the nest, evidently
just after it was hatched, and it remained in the log exactly two
months; it is now flying and feeding itself.t
The young bird differs from the parents in having no golden
marks on the breast, these being displaced by a blotchy band of
green. There are small green feathers blotched about all over the
breast down to the vent, but the general colouring of this region is
crimson as in the adult.
The green of the back is continued up the nape to the top of

Tardus migratorius.
By Dr. Maurice AMSLER.
It was with a feeling somewhat akin to shame that I met our
hard-working Editor in September near the Western Aviaries at
the Zoo. for is he not constantly reminding us that it is not his
business to write and illustrate the whole of the Avicultural Magazine?
However, a friendly and by no means complimentary allusion to the
Mandrill and the Kaiser dispelled all fear that he had any personal
grudge against me, and in the end, when we parted, I had promised
a few notes on the breeding of the above two species. My reason
for choosing these birds being that both males were given me two
years ago by our Editor, and that he, who was the first in Great
Britain to breed them, gave us but sparse notes of the events.
In my humble opinion the Thrush family are amongst the
most attractive and intelligent of aviary birds : easily tamed, more
inclined to breed than any other genus of softbills ; their colouring
whether bright or subdued, is always beautiful, and more important
than all, they are fine songsters.
My Orange-headed Ground Thrush from the very first made
himself at home--this was in the autumn of 1912--but had to be
contented with the company of other species until the following
spring when I obtained for him a much battered and travel-stained
spouse, the latter I kept in a large cage for a time, but one day tried
to introduce my male to her notice. Almost before I had closed the

cage door she was on him, and before I had time to catch him up
she had sadly spoiled his beautiful slate blue back and crown.
In May the hen was in quite fair plumage, so I turned her
into the aviary with the cock, thinking that the latter could well
look after himself seeing that he was in good plumage and stronger
on the wing. I proved to be right and nothing happened for a
fortnight when both these birds began to harass a pair of American
Eobins who were attempting to nest, so off they went into another
aviary. Nothing of moment occurred until July the 10th, when I
noticed the cock carrying hay. The site they chose was the top of
a small nesting box containing some young Zebra Finches ; this
place was so insecure that the nest kept falling down, I thereupon
nailed up a shallow cigar box just above the chosen site and placed
the half-finished nest inside it. The thrushes quite approved of my
help and continued gaily with their task, the female finishing off the
lining with fine grass and cocoa-nut fibre, no mud was used.
During the last few days of building and during incubation
the male collected and gave every insect he could find to the hen.
On July 23rd she was sitting, and a day or two later the hen
being off I mounted a ladder and inspected the nest : there were
three eggs, rather smaller than our thrush's, of a grey-blue ground
colour with chocolate-rufous spots. The cock never incubated, but
frequently fed the hen on the nest, the latter only coming off for a
feed and a bath in the morning and again for a few minutes in the
evening.
On August 4th--twelve days incubation--two chicks had
hatched out : they were pinker in colour than the common thrush.
Five days later one of the young birds had disappeared, but both
parents assiduously fed their remaining offspring. On the 14th, I
took away the young thrush to hand rear, hoping that the parents
would nest again: in this I was disappointed as they shortly began
to moult. The young bird was reared by my cook on hard-boiled
egg and biscuit, together with any available insects. She (for I
believe that was her sex) took kindly to the diet and throve apace ;
at two months she much resembled an adult hen, but both the

breast yellow and the olive green of the back were duller in hue.
In the spring of this year I sent her to the Isle of Wight in exchange
for some other birds and have had no further news of her.
During the autumn the cock became very spiteful and almost
killed his lately much-beloved wife. I had to separate them for the
winter, and in March of this year, when I made sure they would get
on, I returned the hen to the breeding aviary, the bullying began
again, so for another month they were parted. On April the 22nd I
once more tried them together and this time all went well: it was
not until three months later, in July, that a nest was built. This
year, however, the birds behaved differently from last, both birds
took it in turns to squat on the empty nest and led me to believe
that the hen had laid : this continued for ten days or so, until July
22nd, when at last I found the hen sitting in earnest. I was away
for a few days after this event, and on my return on August 4th I
found two young birds about a day old ; odd that they should have
hatched on the same date as last year. This time, however, both
chicks disappeared and no trace of them has ever been seen since.
Nothing&amp;apos; daunted, three more eggs were laid by August 16th, and
two young thrushes left the nest on September 12th and 13th.
In two more points the cock behaved differently this year ;
he never fed the hen either before or after she had laid, and he took
no part in feeding the young, although there were two instead of
only one. He made up however by singing most beautifully every
evening until dark and also sometimes in the early morning. His
song is much sweeter and softer than that of our thrush, but at the
same time is reminiscent of that bird rather than of the blackbird.
The two young birds are growing well and are a pair, I say
this not because there is any difference in the colour of the back as
in the adult Orange-headed Ground Thrush, but because one bird is
of a much lighter body colour than the other and looks almost like
a different species. Both have brownish backs and greyish-yellow
breasts with indistinct speckles of a darker hue, there is also a
darkish line running from the eye downward across the cheek.
The cock is already moulting heavily, and the hen, poor thing, is
quite bare on the face and forehead, the result I think of digging
for worms in the hard dry earth.

Breeding of the Orange-headed Ground Thrush, etc. 33
This species is obviously late in nesting&amp;apos;, but at the same time
appears to moult at the usual period, and there is therefore I fear
little hope of getting a second brood. I do not think it likely that
they would have made a second attempt this year had not the first
brood disappeared when quite young.
I have already mentioned that my American Bobin came
from the same source as the Orange-headed Ground Thrush : he
was in fact bred at Benham Valence in Mr. Astley's aviaries.
I was able to procure a hen for him from Fockelmann, and
she arrived here, as do most birds from Germany (let us give them
their due for one virtue) viz., fit to turn straight out into the
aviary. These two birds were friends from the start and the hen
very shortly became as tame as the cock. Within two months of
her arrival she began to build and was helped in her labours by the
cock. They both persisted in building on a hinged flap placed over
the door of their shelter, and as the said flap has occasionally to be
let down I did my best to discourage them and finally persuaded
them to take possession of a shallow box placed near the chosen
site. Here a coarse untidy nest was constructed, much like that of
a blackbird, the lining being composed of fine grasses and hair, and
of a much more workmanlike finish than the exterior.
On May 14th the hen was sitting on her nest and this she
continued to do until the 24th, when she laid her first egg, almost
like that of the common Song Thrush.* No more followed so I
placed the egg under a wild thrush, who must have sat for a time
and then forsaken, for when I visited the nest on June 10th I found
the eggs cold, but the " foster-egg" contained a fully-formed chick.
To return to my Bobins. The hen remained on her nest for
three days after I had robbed her and then appeared to forgive me.
Here I may quote direct from my notes :--
May 30th. Both birds building in a canary travelling-cage : almost
completed nest in one day and then ceased work.

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
Hen is completing nest in canary cage.
Has been sitting&amp;apos; for twelve days on one egg.
Egg removed " clear."
Has laid again, one egg only.
Chick hatched, flesh colour, white down.
Feather tracts on wing and back visible.
Chick well developed, taken from nest to he hand-
reared : parents quite placid.
Young robin well-grown handsome bird, dark brown
back, orange brown breast with numerous and regu-
larly arranged dark brown spots.
At or about this date I returned him to his native aviary, but
had to take him indoors next day, for I found the poor fellow raw
and bleeding, having been nearly scalped, by his parents I suspect.
The old birds had had enough for one year and spent an uneventful
winter out of doors.
On May 3rd of this year they again built in the same canary
cage, three eggs being laid on the 11th, 12th and 13th ; these all
hatched out on 24th and 25th, the hen only sitting and the cock
perching in a apple tree outside and singing lustily, especially in the
early morning and during wet weather : the song is much like that
of a blackbird--flute-like and mellow.
On the 26th, one of the young was picked up on the ground
below the nest and replaced, on the following day he was picked up
dead. The male bird was an exemplary parent and did more feeding
than the hen. Both birds were wonderfully tame and I unwisely
decided to repeat my experiment of last year when I let some tits
out of their aviary for the purpose of foraging for their young.
I have already mentioned that the birds in question had
built in the shelter-house of their aviary; no other birds had at
that time a nest in the shelter, so I was able to drive the rest of the
occupants to the outer flight where they were shut out. The shelter
is entered from the garden by a door which opens into a small lobby.
The first step was to encourage the parents to come out into this
lobby: this was quickly done by putting the live bait in the lobby
and keeping the door into the garden closed. I next opened the
garden door also, the cock bird who was then doing most of the feeding

came to the threshold, hopped on to the path, took a mealworm
from my feet and flew back to his young. So far so good. Next
time I sprinkled some mealworms about and stood aside, out came
our friend again, picked up all he could and once more returned to
his family ; during this time the hen was brooding the young, for
which I was thankful, as I was not quite so certain of her, and
rightly as my readers will see if they will bear with me a little
longer.
At his next outing I had the pleasure of seeing my American
Eobin perfectly at home in the midst of an English rock garden,
hunting successfully amongst Saxifrages, Helianthemums, Pinks and
a hosts of other plants new to him, but doubtless containing much
that he liked, for again he returned to his family.
Now comes what is to me a source of continual regret (but
shall I be cured ?) The hen appeared at the aviary door and came
right out, she had no intention of doing wrong or of being un-
motherly, but she had not been drilled as had the cock, and after
collecting a few insects did not seem to know her way back; that
she wanted to return I know, else why did she not swallow that
beakful of insects (birds are not entomologists or coleopterists).
Just as the poor thing was at the height of her distress, fully shared
by myself, some kind friend thought fit to enter the garden, not with
due respect and quietly, but noisily and with banging of gates ; this
was more than the frantic mother could stand, and off she flew over
the aviary and out of sight. I searched the neighbourhood and
called at various cottages, but no sign of my bird from that day to
this. I hope that she may be happy in the wilds of Windsor
Forest, where perhaps she may set up house-keeping&amp;apos; with a British
blackbird, or will her migratory instinct carry her away over the
sea as it did the birds of this species liberated at Woburn Abbey.
But I too am wandering. The widowed cock was of course
promptly shut in in the hope that he might bring off the young,
but I saw from the first that he was absolutely desole, he took not
the slightest notice of his erstwhile beloved family and banged him-
self about against the wires like a newly-caught bird ; still I left
him, and next morning shortly after dawn I removed two poor little
half-frozen birds, which I fed and then placed in our heated linen

hands I knew they would be safe: they were only four days old
remember. One of the chicks throve and never looked back, but
the other seemed not to grow at all, he had fits and internal troubles,
common to all babies, and finally when two weeks old he left us.
The survivor is I fear a male, so I am left with no chance of breeding
these charming birds again. Should any fellow-member have a hen
for sale, or in exchange for my young&amp;apos; hand-reared male I should
be pleased to hear from him.

By Ralph A. Holden, E.Z.S.
For some years I have, like Mr. Sidney Williams, devoted a
good deal of attention to the various Weaver Birds, more particularly
to those included in the genus Hyphantornis. And previously to
1914 I had almost succeeded in rearing young from the Spotted-
backed Weaver ( Hyphantornis spilonotus ) and from a hen of that
species paired to a cock Rufous - necked Weaver ( Hyphantornis
cucullatus).
The greatest difficulty which I have personally experienced is
that of obtaining hens of the various species ; the vast majority of
the larger Weavers imported being cocks, and even when immature
birds are bought (a period at which they are most difficult to
accurately sex) a preponderance of cocks seems to appear the
moment that adult plumage is assumed.
Last winter, I therefore counted myself fortunate in having
secured from various sources six undoubted (though immature) hens.

These moulted well about April and, when this operation was com-
plete, the question of identification of the species began. This is no
doubt comparatively simple when one can actually handle the birds
and compare them with the excellent series of skins at South Ken-
sington. But it is quite a different matter in a large out-door aviary.
However, to the best of my belief, the hens they may be labelled as
follows :--four Rufous-necked Weavers, one Spotted-backed Weaver
and one Spekes Weaver (Hyphantornis spekei).
I already had in the aviary five cocks of the Rufous-necked
Weaver and one Spotted-backed Weaver. The latter, though in
magnificent plumage and health, is I fear feeling the effects of
Anno Domini.
Each of these six cocks marked out as his strict territory a
portion of the aviary where he commenced nest-building operations
and permitted no invasion. I should perhaps add no male invasion,
for the periodic inspection of his handiwork by each of the hens
threw him into an apparent ecstasy of joy, and one began to wonder
how long his vocal chords would hold out. If ladies may be
described as capricious the ones in question certainly carried out
the traditions of their sex, for the inspection was most casual, and
seemed to invariably end in stern disapproval both of the architect
and his handiwork.
The ancient Spotted-backed cock was if anything the most
industrious and, if human opinion is of value, certainly the best
workman, for his nests were stronger, thicker, and more neatly
finished than those of his rivals. I only hope that he derived
satisfaction from these facts, as personally he was, and remains a
dead failure with the fair sex.
The most vigorous of the Rufous-necked cocks appropriated
as his reserve the interior of the bird-house, where on a single
branch he constructed with great rapidity some twelve to fifteen
nests, some of them almost touching each other.
Whether or not he had in himself some special attractions,
or whether his architecture possessed some unique quality I do not
know, but the fact remains that he speedily focussed the attention
of all the hens and became a polygamist six times over.
I think myself that the hens were attracted by the idea of

nesting in a colony, and that his collection of nests appealed to
their well-known sociable instincts more than the isolated efforts of
the other birds. At any rate he became, so far as could be observed,
the exclusive possessor of six wives, who, as if they had been drilled
to do so, simultaneously lined the nests with feathers, and with
amusing precision laid their eggs practically on the same day early
in May. It may very well be that some of them had paired with
the other cocks but such was not observed.
In every case, two eggs were laid. The variation of the
eggs of these closely allied species is well known, and mine were no
exception. Here are a few rough descriptions :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9929208" page_id="32670042"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
1. Pure white (no spots).
2. Deep blue (no spots).

4. Pale pink, spotted and blotched with red, brown and ochre.
5. Deep blue (red spots).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99883225" page_id="32670042"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
The remainder were graduations between these types.
Every egg was hatched in due course, and the young birds
did exceedingly well until a week or so old. At this stage disaster
mysteriously overtook them and the majority of them died, one
alone surviving for about a fortnight, by which time it was nicely
feathered. In no case were any fully reared.
This tragedy has occurred three times, that is to say that
eggs have been laid and hatched and young birds partly reared three
times, and the indefatigable birds have to-day (September 2nd) a
fourth lot just hatched. It will be seen that they have not waited
very long between-times.
The aviculturist is ever hopeful, and I am still not despairing,
but I fear that history may repeat itself. Every description of insect
and soft food has been supplied. It is exceedingly difficult to supply
enough of the former, especially when there are other birds in the
aviary, including a pair of Shamas and a pair of Wagtails, and it
may be that this insufficiency is the cause of death, but the dead
birds appeared well nourished.
I observe that when hatching takes place the hens do not, as
is usual with most birds, carry the shells out of sight but merely

drop them vertically from the nest. It may be that, nesting in such
obvious colonies, they regard these precautions as futile.
One frequently hears a bad character awarded to the Hyphan-
tornes in a mixed collection of birds, hut this has never been my
experience, and after a good many years acquaintance with a con-
siderable number I regard them as practically harmless. They are
without doubt extraordinarily fascinating birds and become very
tame.
In the same aviary I have twice this year had Shamas
hatched (but not reared) and the parents are again sitting. Pied
Wagtails have also had two abortive sittings : one when the hen
bird was in a full moult, that is to say without any tail and with an
almost completely bald head.
Other results are a hybrid Green-Grey Singing Finch fully
reared but since dead, and the usual complement of Ribbon-finches,
etc.

The following notes are merely an accompaniment to the
photos of Pekin Robins reproduced. They do not reveal, I fear,
anything novel or out of the way, only a disappointing and not
uncommon experience.
Huggins " and "Muggins" derived their names from the
habit these birds have of roosting side by side, one of the cock's
wings covering the hen's back, the two having the appearance when
asleep of one rather bloated and puffed-out bird.
They decided at the latter end of August--or rather
" Huggins " decided, his wife taking little or no interest in the
proceedings--to set up house. He accordingly selected the covered-
in shelter attached to my little aviary, where bundles of heather are
attached to the walls. The nest was built in one of these bundles
and constructed entirely of grass. It remained unused for about a
week, except when * Huggins " got himself into training by sitting
on it at intervals.

Notes on the Nesting of Hill Tits.
The first egg was laid on the 28th August and the first bird
hatched out on the 9th September, the third of the three making its
appearance on the 11th September, on which day the whole family
were thrown overboard and deposited in various parts of the aviary.
During incubation the hen took her fair share of the labour
and always sat facing outwards, the cock facing invariably in the
other direction. The cock was very careful never to leave the eggs
uncovered even for a short period, and immediately the hen appeared
made his way to the nest. He always stood on the edge while he
thoroughly puffed out his underneath feathers and then slipped in.
Which of them was responsible for the tragedy I cannot say.
I rather think " Huggins," but whoever was the culprit " Muggins "
has declared she will have no more futile attempts at rearing a
family, and is now (21st Sept.) in the middle of a rapid moult and
looking thoroughly dissipated. ' Huggins," on the other hand, is as
fresh as paint and looking just as well as when he came through
the moult last year.
I have a pair of Gouldians nesting in the uncovered part of
my aviary. Their first attempt was not a success and they are now
making a second effort. These are the only two pairs of birds I
have in the aviary with the exception of a pair of Cuban Finches.
My aviary is a lean-to wooden structure, with window open-
ing into it from the house. Two features might be of interest--I
have not heard of their being adopted elsewhere : one is sliding glass
lights, similar to those used to cover garden frames, which cover the
whole open front of aviary, keeping off wind and rain, and can he
removed in summer time either altogether or partially. The other
is waterproof roller blinds in boxes, which can be drawn over the
portions of aviary which are unroofed, at night, thus excluding rain
and visions of cats. As the early morning sun strikes the glass
front the temperature of the aviary becomes appreciably higher than
that of the outside air, an important matter in winter-time. Of
course this arrangement of blinds would not he practicable in a large
aviary, but it is quite feasible in a small one such as mine.

Conurus cactorum.
By Dr. L. LOVELL-KEAYS.
Conures have one great drawback. They are noisy ! My
first pair of Conures were Quakers and the noise was so disturbing
that I passed them on to a friend, since when I have not seen
nearly as much of my friend, and my wife makes horrid inuendos.
But I have long got hardened to mere screechings, and in April of
this year I saw in a paper, more or less devoted to "the fancy," an
advertisement telling of " Yellow-bellied Conures" for one sovereign.
I sent for these rare sounding Conures and it took me some time to
find out what they were. My description and the books' description
seemed to bear very little relationship to one another. However, a
visit to the London Zoo. at once settled the question. I found I
only had Cactus Conures. I turned them out into my large parra-
keet aviary -- a very rough affair with practically no shelter but a
very liberal allowance of eaves to compensate for this. En passant
I should like to emphasive the many and great advantages of eaves.
They are very cheap to construct and very snug and the birds appre-
ciate them very much indeed. I have them made with a decidedly
sharp pitch and a board inside, thus : --
I hang my nesting barrels under the eaves
and supply a good assortment of stiff branches
for the birds to roost on. But I found that one
pair of birds would monopolise a whole length of
eave, so I had it divided into "stalls" by short
vertical lengths of board about two feet apart.
I take no credit for inventing eaves, but I have never seen another
aviary specialise in eaves as mine do and they are an excellent
device. [My aviaries have always had broad eaves.--E d.]
To describe the Cactus Conures very roughly, I should say
they were a light olive green above with decided bluish green
primaries and tail feathers. The head, neck and upper part of the
breast is brownish, but the brown is very distinctly purplish in
tone. By acetevlene gas light the brown appears pure violet. The
under surface of the body is a dull yellow. Hence my bird-friend's
cognomen of Yellow-bellied Conure.

The Breeding of Cactus Conures.
The birds were obviously a pair, but one can only sex these
birds by comparison, and then the beak is the distinguishing feature.
They quickly settled down and in my diary I find that by May 31st
the ben bird was constantly incubating and, practically speaking,
never left the nest. On one of the rare occasions that she did, I
discovered four eggs, perfectly white in colour and roundish oval in
shape and the size of a thrush's egg, only much rounded and fuller.
Young were present on June 28th, and these apparently two or three
days old and presented the ordinary hideous appearance of young
parrakeets--absolutely naked and blind. The quills appear at about
sixteen days and the eyes open soon after.
Cactus Conures have no distinctive nestling plumage, but
probably assume their full plumatic characteristics as they increase
in size. All parrakeets grow and develop very slowly and I have
been tempted many a time to abandon all hope of young. In this
case it was not until August 7th that the first young one left the
nest, and hut for an apparently slight difference in size and being
considerably lighter in colour, one could hardly tell the difference
between the young and old birds. I put the young bird back as it
was a dull damp day, but the next day it was out again, and two
days after two more young made their appearance. They all did
well, and to-day one can hardly tell the young from the old.
The hen bird is incubating again and perhaps will present me
with more young. I understand they had never attempted to breed
before although they had been in captivity some time. They
occupied an aviary with all sorts and conditions of birds, but never
showed any disposition to quarrelsomeness. I might add that the
hen does all the incubating and that the cock appears to feed the
hen on the nest, but only when the coast is clear and nobody about.
The sanitary arrangements are primitive, but do not cause a nuisance
within the meaning of the act.
I have come to the conclusion that parrakeets are easy to
breed if you give them room and not too much disturbance. They
make ideal parents on the whole, but are inclined to neglect their
young before they are well able to fend for themselves. No credit
is due to me for having bred these birds. I only marvel that it
has never been done before. I am sure the great difficulty is to get

a true pair and a breeding pair, i.e. a pair that want to breed. My
pair nested in a 6-inch barrel and the hole was at the top and only
big enough to admit a small hand. I have never found young birds
experience any difficulty in getting out even if the hole is at the top,
and I believe the longer you can prevent them getting out the better.
With these few remarks I will acknowledge my indebtedness to
Dame Fortune, the most successful aviculturist known.

SIR, -- I am writing to suggest that as so many new birds have of late
years been imported, members might tell those less fortunate, how they feed them.*
You will, no doubt, have noticed that in all cases where full description of the
birds is given, where they come from, etc., no mention whatever is made as to
what is found to be the best food, and as this last item is of the greatest
importance, I have often wondered why it is neglected. The omission of this
information really makes the Magazine of little use to anyone, who is a beginner,
and new members must find it curious that the principal point about birds is
left out.
Regarding Mr. Soames' suggestion of more medals. These might
encourage the man in the street to compete, but as you say, it hardH requires
that incentive amongst true bird lovers. E. WARREN VERNON.

SIR, -- With your permission I should like to point out to our members
that the Foreign Bird Exhibitors' League, in conjunction with the London Cage
Bird Association and the National British Bird and Hybrid Club, are holding
their Annual Show as usual at the Horticultural Hall on November 26th, 27th
and 28th, 1914, and intend to devote any profit arising from the Show to the
British Red Cross Fund.
Whilst endeavouring to keep things normal during trying times, they hope
if properly supported to make the exhibition a financial success, and this is
assured providing a large entry of birds is made, coupled with a good gate.
Thirty-one classes have been provided for foreign birds, and our Editor and Mr.
D. Seth-Smith, of the Zoological Gardens, will be two of the judges. Especial
arrangements have been made to collect and despatch exhibits coming and going
by rail, so that provincial exhibitors need not keep their birds away. I there-
fore appeal to our members to do what they can to make this exhibition a success
by entering birds for competition. They will be properly cared for by experts
and little or no risk is attached to showing when birds are sent in suitable show
cages.
Entry forms and other particulars can be obtained from Mr. F. Knight,
64, Chaplin Road, Wembley, Middlesex, on November 1st, and entries will be
received by the Show Manager up to November 23rd. I shall be only too pleased
to give anyone further particulars with regard to the Exhibition, and I hope that
those who cannot show will at least pay a visit to the Show. All being well
there will be on exhibition a number of unique birds, many of which are rarely
to be seen in any public or private collection in Great Britain.

THE KINGFISHER.
Alcedo ispida.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Looking out of one of my bedroom windows one morning in
October I saw the brilliant blue of a Kingfisher as he flashed over
the moat and passed beneath the arch of the old stone bridge.
That was my view of him on the south side of the room, where
two windows with their sashes of Queen Anne period, one on either
side of the chimney and fire place, look out on a wide prospect
towards a wooded hill in the middle distance on the left hand, and
to the Black Mountains in the further distance on the right.
And my next sight of him was in the big cedar-tree, planted
by Wordsworth and Southey, which spreads its blue-green foliage in
front of the other two windows on the west side of the room,
stretching its red-brown branches over the broader part of the moat.
Let me mention that I can lie in bed and see by night the moon
above the wooded hill, which from that point of view forms a back-
ground to the cedar, gleaming through the branches ; indeed on a
winter's morning I have been able from one of the south windows
to look at the sun rising in the E.S.E., and turning round, to see the
full moon setting in the N.W., just as if she were thinking, " here
he comes, my light is no longer needed." Does some impatient
aviculturist break in with " what twaddle, go on about the King-
fisher, bother the moon ! "
Well I will! The Kingfisher in question was perched within

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
twelve yards of my windows on a bare branch just above the moat,
and every few seconds he bobbed his head, looking intently into the
water beneath him. Perfectly still but for this bobbing&amp;apos; of the head,
he sat there for fully ten minutes, during which time my matutinal
dressing was delayed. Suddenly he pulled himself together, gazed
down with a greater alertness and then splash , and off he went to
the Flamingoes' pond with a small dace in his long bill.
x\nother day, as I stood at one of the windows of the Dining-
Parlour, where the moat is within a few feet of the house, and kept
from it by a long bed of flowers and a narrow paved way, the King-
fisher came shooting under the stone bridge with a silvery fish in
his bill, which contrasted wonderfully with the azure blue of his
upper plumage, as the rays of the morning sun shone on him. I
have, although I have been in my present home for thirteen months
never seen more than one, always I believe the same bird, but I hope
he may find a mate next year, and build in some spot that suits him
and her.
Nothing saddens me much more in the matter of bird des-
truction than to constantly see stuffed Kingfishers. There they are
in taxidermists' shop-windows, in gamekeepers' cottages, and in
many a country inn, more often than not, most vilely set up as
well as moth-eaten ; besides which many are slaughtered by owners
of trout streams. That this bird of gorgeous plumage should be so
persecuted is to me monstrous. It is high time that the English,
who are horrified at the barbarity of the Germans in the wicked
war still raging, should instil into the rising generation a greater
respect for and interest in the beauties of our wild life, teaching
them from earliest years the pleasure to be derived from watching the
birds, and emphasizing the virtues of mercy and love towards them.
If the Kingfishers do prey upon very small trout, and as a rule these
birds are to be found in the smaller back waters where minnows
abound and form their food, cannot some be spared for these lovely
creatures ?
They perish enough as it is, during hard winters, when the
nights are freezingly cold and the ice covers up their breakfast and
dinner. Women too have worn their skins in their hats, more shame
to them ; our one British bird with really tropical colouring.

If after the war there comes a new heaven and a new earth,
let us hope that the interest that has of late years sprung up in wild
life amongst us, will continue to grow, so that many species of birds
will also find a new earth instead of the contents of a cartridge.
We shall surely have had enough of ruthless destruction!

Mr. Pycraft has written of the Kingfisher in ' The British
Bird Book': "Of all our native birds it is one of the most interesting,
" as it is also one of the most persecuted. It has been the theme of
fables, and of poetry, from time immemorial; for generations it
has been subjected to the desecrations of the milliner and the
" bird-stuffer, while the malice of the fisherman has been scarcely
" less malignant; only by the ornithologist has it been neglected."
" Some facts in regard to its life-history have been harvested
" from the raids of the egg-collector ; but of the rest of its economy
" we know little. We are, however, it is Imped, entering upon a
" new era in regard to the study of birds."
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995214" page_id="32670065"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
Our Kingfisher is the member of a very large family. A
whole monograph, a good-sized volume, has been published.
The smallest Kingfisher known has a length of 3f inches, the
largest, the laughing Jackass of Australia, is 17 inches long. In
some the bill has a hook at the tip, in another species it is serrated
along the cutting edge, whilst in another the beak is short and of
great width. Neither have all Kingfishers the short tail that the
British one has; for one species grows two central tail feathers with
long racquets.
Some eat fish, like the British Kingfisher ; others live in arid
places feeding on lizards, insects and small mammalia.
In colouring too, the species differ considerably, from simple
black and white in one, to blue and white, red and white, green, blue,
and red, etc. in others.
With our own bird, the sexes are barely distinguishable, and
the young in their first plumage, although decidedly duller on fore-
neck and breast, are almost as brilliant as the adults.
As is well known to most people interested in birds, the King-
fisher builds in holes in banks of streams and cuttings. Mr. Pycraft
writes : " The Kingfisher invariably digs for itself, and the mouth of
" the burrow can be recognised at a glance from that of any other

" creature. And this because of its shape, which is oval, and with
" clean-cut edges. Thereby it differs from the burrow of the Sand-
" martin, which is cordiform, the apex upwards. The initial stage
" of the tunnelling is said to be performed by charging the desired
" spot at full tilt, using the beak after the fashion of a lance, till a
"cavity is made large enough to afford a grip for the feet."
"As a rule, such nests take the form of a long ascending
"tunnel, about a yard in length, ending in a brooding chamber, the
" eggs resting on a platform of fish bones, and the hard part of
" shrimps and other indigestible portions of food. These remains
" are the gradual accumulation of pellets, thrown up as in the case
" of owls, hawks, and many other birds which swallow food con-
taining much indigestible matter."
The eggs are white tinged with pink, which tint is due to the
colour of the blood vessels surrounding the yolk, showing through
the shell.
I have seen Kingfishers, evidently on migration, on the Lake
of Como in Italy in the autumn. On one occasion one passed,
flying close above the surface of the w 7 ater when I was in a launch
at least a mile from any of the shores.
Kingfishers ought to live perfectly well in an aviary with a
deepish pool in which minnows could be placed, but unless the aviary
was really roomy, one would not have the pleasure of seeing the
arrow-like flight of this lovely bird.
If any members can try to observe more closely the habits of
the Kingfisher, especially in the matter of the display of the male
(if any) and write an account for the Magazine, we shall be grateful.

There is something very entrancing in the sight of a well-kept
enclosure of Cranes. The dignified, yet graceful, movements of these
birds as they walk about; their beautiful and, at times, striking
colouration, and the ease with which they are kept, have tempted
more than one amateur to purchase these lovely creatures as additions
to their aviaries or bird enclosures. Several, whose wealth has
enabled them to gratify their natural inclinations in the fullest

degree, have included examples of all the known species of Cranes
in their collections ; the ability to do this, however, does not fall to
the lot of everyone, for many of the species are very costly as well
as difficult to procure.
Cranes appear to the greatest advantage when they can be
allowed to run--pinioned, of course--in a large paddock or other
similar place, a park for example. They are birds that require a
good deal of exercise. Some of the different species of Cranes breed
in captivity, but in such a case not more than one pair of birds
should be in one enclosure ; they make their nest on the ground, of
reeds, rushes, and tall grass, with a few sticks. Two eggs are
usually laid, but there generally the matter ends in the case of the
ordinary aviculturist, for the eggs do not always hatch out, or if they
do, the parents do not succeed in rearing the young. The great crux
in the rearing of young Cranes hatched in captivity is providing an
adequate supply of insect life as food. No one hut those who have
persevered time after time, in spite of many failures, realises what an
enormous amount of soft-bodied insects these young Cranes require
and how indefatigably the parents work in hunting and searching all
over the paddock in order that the nestlings may have a proper and
sufficient supply of food. It appears absolutely necessary that the
insects for feeding the young Cranes must have soft bodies as I have
repeatedly noticed the old birds, when given a large dish of mealworms,
carefully pick out those that had just sloughed their hard coats for
the nestlings and eat the others themselves. This seems rather
strange, for adult Cranes will eat the hardest coated beetles with
the greatest enjoyment, and when during the summer months flights
of dor-beetles are common, the Cranes soon get to know, and in the
evenings may be noticed searching the railings and tree-trunks of
their enclosure for such of these insects as have settled after their
flight.
One very great advantage that Cranes possess over Herons as
pets is that they do not need such a quantity of purely animal food
(fish, liver, etc.) as do the latter birds, but may be fed on soaked
dog-biscuits, bread, grain, and insect food. When the latter runs
short it may be necessary to give a little flesh or fish to make up
for the deficiency of the other, but so long as earth-worms, grubs and

snails are plentiful they will not require the meat. The most suitable
grain foods are wheat, barley and Indian corn, especially the last,
which can be given liberally ; in the case of those birds that have just
been imported or that are weakly and ill, it may with advantage be
soaked in boiling water until it is soft, otherwise it can be given dry.
The species par excellence for beginners with these birds is
the Demoiselle Crane, a delightful creature of most delicate coloura-
tion. The body is of a beautifully soft pearl-grey tint, the wing
feathers are long, pointed, and hang over the tail, being tipped with
black ; the face, throat, and fore-neck are a very dark slate colour,
the feathers of the latter being very long and pendulous ; the ear-
tufts are silvery white, the feathers curving gracefully downward
on each side of the neck. As may be judged this species is a
particularly handsome and graceful bird; it is also one of the tamest
in disposition and speedily gets attached to its owner. Another point
in its favour is that it is perfectly hardy and thrives in most
situations, although a dry soil suits it best. The average cost of
a pair of these Cranes is from #3 to #4 when bought from a dealer,
but a short advertisement in one of the live-stock papers would
probably result in an offer at a lower figure ; in fact, a short time
ago I had an offer of Demoiselle Cranes at a #1 apiece. Being
imported in fairly large numbers if is nearly always on the market
and specimens are readily obtainable at all times from any of the
recognized dealers.
Examples of this species have been bred in this country on
several occasions, but all Cranes, and the Demoiselle is not an ex-
ception, are very capricious in this respect and will steadily refuse
to do anything of the kind under what appear to be the most
favourable circumstances. This may go on for three or four seasons,
but during the third or fourth year signs of a desire to nest often
become apparent to the observant eye. This is usually noticeable
in an increasing shyness of the birds, and it is at this point that
most amateurs go wrong by generally attributing this conduct to any
reason but the real one, the most usual thing that the beginner
thinks is that the birds have been frightened and their owner
attempts to restore confidence by giving them a good deal of his
or her company and by petting them up by following them about

with bonnes touches in the shape of nice fat, luscious insects. Now
this, well meaning as it is, is just exactly what the birds do not
want; what they do want is to be left severely alone. Directly it
is observed that the Cranes are getting shy and retiring themselves
from close observation, especially if they are noticed to be picking
up bits of sticks, they should be left undisturbed as much as possible 9
and all dogs and strangers kept away from their enclosure ; an arm-
ful of twigs may be thrown in to them, or an old birch-broom untied
and given to them. If it is really a desire to set up housekeeping
that has rendered the birds shun observation they will make use of
the twigs by commencing on their nest at once. Cranes in selecting
a site for their nest are rather erratic in their tastes ; sometimes, and
very often they are the shyest birds that do so, they will make their
nest in a quite open and unsheltered situation, whilst another pair of
Cranes will select a nesting site which is screened from observation
by a protecting bush. Two eggs are generally laid, but if they have
nested previously with unfertile ones, sometimes only one is laid
and the hen starts sitting right away. When two eggs are laid the
second is deposited two days after the first and the hen begins to
incubate at once ; the period of incubation lasts four weeks and both
parents take turns in the work, often relieving each other five or six
times during the day. Like many other birds at this time they are
very cautious in their behaviour, and if their enclosure is entered,
even by their owner, the sitting bird will slip off the nest at once,
often pretend to feed and nearly always walk in a different direction
from its companion, in an attempt to draw the intruder's attention
away from the nest and eggs : if this be unsuccessful and the person
approaches too near the nest for the bird's peace of mind, the Cranes
will adopt the same artifice as that displayed by the Lapwing, the
hen tumbling along the surface of the ground as though she had a
broken wing or was injured in some manner, while the male will
puff up his neck and head feathers in an effort to make a show of
ferocity towards the intruder.
The eggs will hatch out, if fertile, about the twenty-eighth
day ; the young birds are dark biscuit colour, shading off to a cream
tint, with chocolate marking&amp;apos;s and, like all nestlings, are dear little
things. The parents start feeding the young at once, each parent

bird attaching itself exclusively to one nestling and devoting the
whole of its attention to that one in particular. It is a most
interesting sight to see the assiduity with which the adult birds
will methodically search through a paddock for insects, with the
young ones following them, leaving hardly a square yard unexamined;
directly an insect is seen it is caught up by one of the parents and
given into the mouth of the particular young one it is specially
looking after. The young only remain in the nest for about four
days after they are hatched, and from that time onwards the old
birds brood the young ones in dry situations wherever the grass
may be short, not always using the same place every night but
moving from place to place as fancy takes them. At this time
these Cranes are very intolerant of rain, and are most solicitous
that the young should not get wet by always selecting at such a
time a spot close to the bole of a tree as their sleeping&amp;apos; place in
order that the young can get proper shelter under the branches.
The young seem to be entirely dependent on the old birds for at
least a fortnight, and until that period has elapsed I have never seen
them attempt to pick up anything for themselves; just after the
second week the old Cranes commence giving the young wheat
grains, and once they have succeeded in getting well on to this
they will thrive rapidly. It is the first three weeks of their lives
that is the most difficult period of their existence as they subsist
entirely on small soft insects found on the grass stems and foliage
of their enclosure, and unless there is a plentiful and constant
natural supply of this kind of food they will invariably die. But
once they have got over the first month they will make astonish-
ing progress, so much so that a careful eye must be kept on them
in case they escape from their paddock, for they can fly before the
uill feathers are fully grown. If they do, they are not likely to get
right away, for they will in all probability return to the old birds,
but it may give their owner a nervous half-hour watching them as
they soar round at an elevation of about 150 yards in a circle nearly
a mile in diameter, wondering all the while whether they will come
back or not.
Another species of Crane, well worthy of the serious atten-
tion of those interested in these birds, is the Australian Crane, the

" native companion " of the colonists. This bird is of a different
shade of colour to the preceding&amp;apos; species, being rather a bluish, or
French grey, as the tint of its plumage, the top of the head and the
beak are of an olive-green colour, as is also the gular pouch ; the back
of the head is papillose skin of a brilliant scarlet. This Crane is not so
reliable in its temper as the gentle Demoiselle and most individuals
are inveterate practical jokers, as evidenced by the sly manner with
which they will sidle up alongside any one who may be inside their
enclosure, looking the pictures of innocence, and then give a nasty
lunge with their spear-like beak at the person of the intruder,
usually selecting, if it be a man, the back of the calf of the leg ; or,
if a lady, the back or palm of the hand. Like the majority of the
Cranes this species is very hardy and may safely be left out of doors
during all weathers, saving the most exceptionally severe, when it is
advisable to put them under shelter. They are so disregarding o
the state of the climate that they will wade in a half-frozen pond
during a frost and wait until they are literally frozen in and have
to be released. In spite of my fears that they would suffer from
the prolonged exposure to the ice-cold water, the experience seemed
to have no ill-effects upon them and they were none the worse for
it. Although I have not as yet had the good fortune in my own
aviaries, these particular Cranes have nested in this country, but I
am not certain whether the eggs hatched and the young reared to
maturity; I think that both the Duchess of Bedford and Mr. H. D.
Astley were equally unfortunate in this respect. If the male bird is
pinioned there is no need to perform the same operation on the hen,
for she does not appear to want to fly away, although fond of long
aerial flights from which she will always return ; at least such is my
experience.
The Australian Crane is a very jealous bird, quick to take
offence, and deeply resents the intrusion of another crane of a
different kind to himself on that portion of the enclosure round
which he has set an imaginary boundary, but will, directly a tres-
passer is noticed, run at him with outstretched wings and clappering
beak and fairly chase him off the private territory that has been
appropriated by himself and his mate ; in fact, the solitary example
of the Common Crane is constantly being chased about by both the

Cranes in Captivity
pair of Australian Crane and the two Cape Crowned Cranes as he
\0x25A0inadvertently steps into the area reserved to themselves by his com-
panions, the three species being kept in one paddock.
The general favourites at first sight, with most people, are
the Crowned Cranes, of which there are two or three species.
The illustration of a pair of Crowned Cranes wading in the bed of
a small stream gives a very good idea of the beauty of these birds,
and it is the quaint-looking, stiff-plumed, top-knot which adds to the
attractiveness of them. They possess certain advantages over the
other species of Cranes in that they have, when they choose to give
vent to it, a rather more musical voice than that of Cranes generally
also, they are not nearly so destructive to growing plants as are some
of the others, although, curiously enough, Crowned Cranes seem less
fond of insect-food and more fond of growing grass-seed and grain
generally. In disposition they are quite as gentle as the more
commonly seen Demoiselle ; gentle, that is, towards their owner,! for
they are more determined at shifting trespassing Cranes of a different
species, and will even vent their displeasure by chasing the offending
bird all over the paddock. The call of these Cranes is not at all
unlike the ' toot ' of a motor-trumpet being sounded a little distance
away, and those people who hear the call for the first time, without
seeing the birds, often think that there is a motor car approaching
along the by-road near the enclosure. They are distinctly greedy
birds, always rushing up to the food-pan directly it is replenished and
never allowing the others to have anything until they have quite
satisfied themselves, and will often behave in a very ' dog&amp;apos; in the
manger&amp;apos; fashion by mounting guard over what is left to prevent the
others having any, so that if this trait is noticed in any Cranes of
this species belonging to my readers it will be as well to provide
more than one food-pan, in order that the others may get their
food without being obliged to wait for the Crowned Cranes to
give way.
The Crowned Cranes are rather impatient of damp, and a very
valuable 'tip' for the aviculturist, who has any of this species in his
collection, is to make a small gravelled run in that part of the

paddock which these birds reserve to themselves : a yard of gravel
will be ample as this quantity will cover at least five yards of ground.
When this is provided it will be noticed that in wet weather, when
the grass is wet, particularly if it be long, these Cranes will always
be standing on the gravelled patches.
In Crowned Cranes the cheeks are bare skin evenly divided
into two distinct patches of pink and white, the proportion varying
in different species : the general tint of the neck and body is ashy
or greyish black, the wings and tail being white with a rich chocolate
brown ; but the thick, upright crest of straw-coloured bristle-like
feathers is the dominant features of these birds, and the one to
which in no small degree their beauty and attractive appearance is
due. There seems some diversity of opinion among those who
possess these birds as to whether it is necessary to keep them
entirely under cover or not during the winter months : some keep
them indoors from November to March, others take no trouble with
their birds in this respect and claim that these Cranes suffer no ill-
effects by so doing. So far as my own experience teaches, all that is
necessary is to put up a small summer-house erection made of wood,
with a tarred roof; this need not be larger in size than about 6ft. cube,
entirely closed all round with the exception of a small open doorway,
through which the birds can pass one at a time. It is an advantage
if the floor can be raised a few inches above the ground level and
covered with peat-moss litter. When such a shelter as this is
provided for their use, the birds can then decide whether the weather
is too inclement or not, and please themselves if they make a retreat
into it. Generally it will be found that they will only seek its pro-
tection during the most stormy weather, especially that accompanied
by a strong driving wind ; at other times, even the most cold, they
will be proudly marching about the paddock, heedless of snow and
frost. The roof of this structure should slope towards the back with
the ground at that part raised a bit so as to carry the water away
from the shelter as, if the roof slopes towards the front, unless the
ground is well drained, there is always a pool just in front of the
doorway. This point must be especially looked after if the floor is
not raised.
Another very charming Crane is the Stanley or, as it is some-

times called, Paradise Crane. This is a most beautiful bird, bluish-
grey in colour, with rather a massive-looking head and extremely
long wing-feathers which almost reach to the ground. This species
requires more animal-food than the other kinds and a few meal-
worms are a very acceptable addition to the diet; if these are not
readily obtainable, spiders and woodlice, especially the latter, may be
given. For grain food, a mixture of wheat, dari, and rice in the
husk is as good as anything. It is an extremely gentle bird.
The Sams Crane, of which examples are often offered for sale
by dealers, is not a suitable bird for mixed collection of Cranes, owing
to its spiteful disposition, as it is always interfering with the other
Cranes, pecking them and very often inflicting nasty injuries on
them. When, however, a separate enclosure can be provided for it,
this species makes a handsome addition to the aviaries. The cry is
very loud and piercing and can be heard long distances, especially at
night, and for this reason it is not advisable to have this bird in
too close proximity to the dwelling-house as it is apt to disturb one's
rest, more particularly if one is a light sleeper. The appearance of
this species is very stately: the colouration is French grey and a
considerable portion of the head and neck is bare skin of a reddish
tint.
The Asiatic White Crane is a very beautiful bird of dazzling
white plumage, with black at the end of the primaries of the wings.
This species is a more shy bird than the Sarus and possessed of
a very feeble voice, except during the breeding season. It never
goes far away from the water pool. The feeding and management
is the same as for the other Cranes.
The Common Crane, once widely distributed through these
islands, is now no longer a resident and only a most irregular visitor.
The colour is dark-grey. Their voice is trumpet-like and rather
eerie, especially when heard in the early morning. They make nice
additions to a collection, but are rather spiteful towards any com-
panions in the same enclosure, especially if they be smaller than

Some years ago there was living in the Western Aviary at the
Zoo a curious pigeon which had been received from the Seychelles.
The bird was of arboreal habit, sitting sluggishly on its perch, which
it grasped with well-developed, powerful feet. Its head was crimson
above, the neck and breast were grey, the upper parts and tail blue-
black : the orbits, lores, and forehead were wattled. The writer at
once recognised it as one of the wart pigeons {Alectrcenas) . Now
although attractive from its rarity and also on account of its quaint
yet beautiful coloration, the full interest of this specimen does not
appear to have been grasped by aviculturists. The bird was already
in poor health when photographed by the writer ; no paper relating
to it having appeared in the interval since its death, the present
account may be of interest.
The specimen in question--the Alectrcenas pulcherrima of
naturalists--is known as the "Pigeon Hollandais" in the Seychelles.
The reason for this is very curious : many years ago there existed
[not in the Seychelles but in Mauritius] an allied species, then also
called Pigeon Hollandais. This bird ( Alectrcenas nitidissima) had
the head and neck white ; the back, wings, and under parts indigo ;
the rump, tail and tail-coverts crimson ; its popular name, in fact,
denoted that it wore the colours of the Dutch flag. It was dis-
covered by Sonnerat, who brought home two specimens in 1781.
He appears to have been an early aviculturist, for one of his birds,
still in the Natural History Museum at Paris, shows by its broken
feathers the effects of prolonged confinement in a cage. About 1815
M. Dufresne had another specimen, but whether alive is not known ;
this bird is now in the Edinburgh Museum. To-day three museum
specimens--in Paris, Edinburgh, and Port Louis (Mauritius) -- are all
that is left of a fine species.
Uno avulso non deficit alter. The name "Pigeon Hollandais"
was transferred to the Alectrcenas pulcherrima , although its colora-
tion was markedly different, and it did not represent the colours of
the Dutch flag. The present species is not a very accurate under-
study of its departed relative ; thus the neck and breast are grey

Mr. W, Shobe Baily,
instead of white, the upper parts are blue black rather than indigo,
while the tail is blue black instead of crimson ! One may class the
present instance as another example of the inaccuracy which seems
to infest zoological nomenclature in Africa and its islands. Thus
amongst the birds alone, the "Cape Lory" is really a Touraco and
the "Toucans" are Tree Hornbills, while the Paauw or "Peacock" is
a Bustard, the " Turkey" is a Ground Hornbill, and " Pheasants"
and "Partridges" are Francolin !
Considerable avicultural interest attaches to the three young
birds which were kept alive in 1862 by the Acting&amp;apos; Civil Commissioner
for the Seychelles. They are quite arboreal, and would not leave
their perches unless obliged ; they were fed on berries and small
fruit. They were supposed to be the true A. niticlissima, and if so
were among the last of their race ; yet although they were fully
fledged some uncertainty existed as to their species, and they may
have been the "new" Pigeon Hollandais which normally inhabits
the Seychelles. In the new Pigeon Hollandais its lamented con-
gener lives again, rising Phoenix-like from its ashes. It is to be
hoped that no more of these quaint, beautiful island species will be
lost, and that the Pigeon Hollandais of to-day will soon be better
known to aviculture.
WEAVERS.
By W. Shobe Baily.
The Weavers--more especially those of the Hyphcmtornis
group--do not seem to he very great favourites with aviculturists,
and dealers tell me that, except for the commoner kinds such as
P. franciscanco and afra, they are not always easy of sale. I am
sure that I do not know why this should be so, as in appearance
they are extremely attractive birds, and besides being easy to cater
for, are quite hardy. A group of Orange or Crimson Crowned males
in full plumage equals in beauty anything I have seen in bird-life,
even if it does not surpass it. In the Boyers House aviaries I have
many varieties, and the following short account of some of their
doings this season may be of interest to your readers.

The Abyssinian Weaver (H. abyssinicus). I have four
cocks and one hen. The difficulty with all Weavers is to get true
pairs. I bought so-called true pairs from two different dealers, only
to find when they came into colour that they were all males. How-
ever I was lucky enough to pick up a hen from another source rather
late in the Spring and this bird laid three eggs--white, finely marked
with pink spots--and hatched one young one, which unfortunately
only lived fourteen days, being drowned in the nest by a heavy
thunderstorm. All the cocks proved great nest - builders, using
almost any material that came handy. Their nests were retort
shaped and usually hung from the wire roof of the aviary. They
were not nearly so closely woven as some of the other Weavers'
nests, and this was probably the reason why the pair that nested
failed to bring up their young one, the rain finding its way through
too easily. The brilliant black and yellow of the males make them
quite the handsomest of all the large Weavers.
The Rufous-necked Weaver (H- cucullatus). Of these
I have three cocks and one hen. The cocks are much duller in
colour than the Abysinnian and are in consequence less handsome.
The hens of the two varieties are practically indistinguishable. Two
of my males proved good nest-builders, but, although I frequently
saw the hen inspecting the nests, no eggs were laid. These nests
were built in bushes and trees and were fairly well woven. The
song of the Rufous-necked is not so clear or varied as that of the
Abysinnian, but is still rather pleasing.
Another large Weaver is the Olivaceous (S. olivaceus),
which is quite equal in size to either of the two varieties just
mentioned. It differs from them in having no black about it and
in having white instead of red eyes. When in full breeding plumage
the face is dusky, its white eyes making it look almost black, but
when compared with one of the other black-faced Weavers, the
difference is at once noted. This is the finest nest Weaver I have, for
although he failed to secure a mate, and consequently only built two
nests and these early in the Spring, yet these nests are as good now
as when they were built and are quite water-tight. From this bird
and a hen ( H. mariquensis) I raised two hybrids last season. The
young male hybrid has also proved a great nest-builder and has

Mr. W. Shore Baily,
woven quite a score of nests this season, but has been unsuccessful
in persuading a hen to occupy one of them. In colour he almost
exactly resembles a hen Rufous-necked having no black or brown
whatever about him and being about the same size.
The Black-headed Weaver ( H. melanocephalus). I have
five cocks and one hen. Here again the dealers seem unable to
differentiate between the sexes when they are out of colour. One
or two of the cocks proved good Weavers, but it is possible the
absence of hens prevented the others from making any serious
nesting attempts.
The Black-hooded Weaver (H. heuglinii). I possess a
single male. In appearance he is very like melanocephalus , but has
less black on the forehead and a little rufous on the throat. He
proved a very good builder, hanging his nests from the branches of a
spruce.
The Half-masked Weaver (H. vitellinus). Of these,
three cocks only, hens apparently being unobtainable. With their
chestnut coloured heads these are very pretty birds, and it was
unfortunate that I was unable to find mates for them as they built
many nests and were apparently most anxious to undertake parental
duties.
The Golden Weaver (H. galhula). I have two pairs of
these and one pair nested, but I think the eggs must have been taken
by mice, as the nest was rather low down in a bush and easily
accessible to these vermin. The males are about the size of
vitellinus, but the crown of the head is bright yellow and there
is no rufous below the black of the throat.
The Short-winged Weaver (H. hrachypterus). I have
two cocks only. They very closely resemble galbula and are about
the same size. Only one of these attempted to build; the sites
chosen being very varied. The nests were always well-constructed,
the entrance hole usually being in the side.
The Dwarf Weaver (S. luteola). Of these pretty little
birds I have two pairs, one of which nested twice, bringing up two
young ones on each occasion. They are about the size of an English
Siskin, and the males are like miniature melanocephalus, having no
rufous or chestnut colour about them. The young, which were grey

in colour with white breasts, were raised very largely upon meal-
worms, although seed, principally spray millet, was also taken. The
eggs were white.
Taha Weavers (P. taha ). Two pairs of these were given a
large aviary, in which there were no birds larger than themselves,
but strange to say no attempt at nesting was made. The cocks are
extremely active and spent much of their time chasing each other
and the hens around and around the aviary. They look very hand-
some with their brilliant black breasts, contrasting so vividly with
the bright yellow of the other parts of the body. They differ from
P. afra by having the black on the under parts of the body extended
to the throat. Like all the genus they are very fond of mealworms,
and when I was feeding the Dwarf Weavers with these they generally
managed to get their share.
Crimson Crowned Weavers (P. flammiceps ). I have three
cocks only of this handsome variety, two of which were purchased
from a Continental dealer as a true pair of P. oryx. Hens of this
variety also seem unprocurable, which is a great pity as they would
well repay the trouble of breeding/&quot; One or two of them built nests,
but they were never properly completed.
Orange Weavers (P .franciscana). Five cocks and four hens.
Napoleon Weavers (P. afra). Three pairs.
Red-billed Weavers (Quelea quelea). Three pairs.
These four last-named varieties were all kept together in a
large aviary, 13ft. high and having no natural cover. In with them
were Budgerigars, Cockatiels and Rosellas ; and although there were
many nests, as far as I know no eggs were laid. This is I suppose
what one might expect under these conditions, but the lack of
success in breeding them is more than compensated for by the grand
appearance they make in the aviary now that the males are all in
full colour. Another season, if all is well, I shall hope to place
them under more natural conditions, when some of them may bring
off young ones.
* Dr. Butler secured two hens amongst females of P. franciscana (Vide
Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary, Vol. I. p. 194).

By Miss E. F. Chawneb.
I have had very little success this year as far as nesting is
concerned. Indigo Buntings built a neat nest of hay and grass lined
with tow in such a position that it was impossible to go in or out of
the aviary without almost brushing against it. Though plenty of
cover was provided it was stuck up in the fork of a dead bough
without any attempt at concealment. As the birds were new comers,
and the hen in particular very shy, the attempt was doomed from
the start. Three eggs were dropped in different parts of the aviary
and then the hen brooded in the empty nest for about a week before
giving it up. The cock did not appear to take the smallest interest
in her proceedings and I never even saw him near the nest. Both
birds are much tamer now, and I hope, if they come through the
winter, for better luck next summer.
Long-tailed Grassfinches built and laid several eggs, then the
hen fell ill, and though she recovered she wisely did nothing more in
the nesting line.
The Hooded Siskins raised my hopes by carrying nesting
material to most of the likely places in the aviary, but it went no
further, and this autumn to my regret the cock died. He was a
charming bird and I miss his gay song and lively ways every time I
go to the aviary. I bought him in 1911, and to the day of his death
he never looked sick or sorry.
My old Pekin Robins built a lovely cup of hay lined with
dead leaves and hatched three young ones. But mealworms and
live ants' eggs "gave out" and, owing to the war, no more were
obtainable. I tried grasshoppers, and the old birds took to them
at once and fed with them, but the young died just as the first had
left the nest. I do not know for certain if the grasshoppers were to
blame, but I have my suspicions. Hitherto the Pekins have always
been successful and reared numerous youngsters on small meal-
worms, flies, wasp grubs, and live ants' eggs. This year, as luck
would have it, wasp grubs were particularly late and small in this
district and I hardly got any, though a fair number of nests were
taken.

The solitary success is a pair of hybrids between a St. Helena
Seed-Eater and an English Linnet. The Seed-eater died before the
young were hatched and they were fathered by a Grey Singing&amp;apos; Finch
x Linnet, which was hatched last year. In fact, seeing him so atten-
tive to the young I took it for granted that he was their true father
and did not discover my mistake until they came into full plumage.
One is quite a pretty bird, a Seed-eater in size and shape, with a
brown breast washed with yellow and a bright yellow rump, the
back, wings, and tail resemble the Linnet. The other, which I take
to be a hen, is much duller and browner. It is strange that the
Seed-eater should have paired with the Linnet as there is a hen of
his own species in the same aviary; he would have nothing to say
to her, but continually followed the Linnet, driving off the Grey
Singing-Finch mule, who also had aspirations to her and paired
with her as soon as the Seed-eater died.
I wonder how other members have succeeded with the Black-
chinned Yuhina ? One only of mine has survived, a cock. Whether
it has anything to do with his longevity I cannot say, but he has
always supplemented his diet of sop and fruit with " eg&amp;apos;gbisco," which
his companions would not touch.
Two baby House Martins, which had fallen from their nests,
were brought to me and successfully hand-reared on mealworms, flies,
and grasshoppers. As is the way of these delightful birds, they speedily
became not only quite fearless but extremely affectionate, delighting
in being handled and petted. When old enough they were set at
liberty and immediately flew off. It is curious that being so tame
they should never have returned to their human friends, but I have
found it invariably the case that with them out of sight is out of
mind.*
Another waif was a young Puffin, picked up in the forest by
a beater. It was uninjured but starving ; at first it had to be
crammed, but after a few days would feed from hand. Then it took
to picking up bits of herring for itself if they were put in its water
dish ; any bits left on dry land were utterly ignored, and grew quite
plump. It was taken by a friend and turned out on the coast at

The Crowned Cranes at Logan.
Beaulieu, where I hope it will do well and fall in with others of its
species.
The Eagle and Marbled Owls went to nest as usual, but
their eggs were all infertile.
My Rainbow Buntings are now (Oct. 28th) in heavy moult
but perfectly well. They are very beautiful birds and easily managed
but not particularly interesting; they usually skulk in the thickest
cover the aviary affords them, where they are practically invisible,
and they never utter a sound or pay the slightest attention to any-
thing except mealworms. They are perfectly peaceable and inoffen-
sive, that is to say my pair is, I have no experience of any others.
THE CROWNED CRANES AT LOGAN.
By M. Portal.
The pair of Crowned Cranes at Logan, which are not pinioned,
bred again this year for the fourth time, nesting close to the
site of former nests, but again the two young birds died after a
short time. As this year there was no rain to affect them, it is
most disappointing.
The female laid two more eggs, and these have been placed
under a hen and are not yet incubated. Their prospect of growing
up is I fear remote, even if they hatch, as all food will have to be
artificial and the weather cold, besides the fact that the hen will
have some trouble to cover them after a few days.
If Mr. McDouall had a small greenhouse available I should
have been inclined to heat it slightly and let hen and young have it
to run in and out of, and wire off a portion outside. One fears
otherwise that wet w T eather and a chill will see the death of these
birds.
The food they pick up in the summer must be deficient of
what the young need, and the only solution might be to enclose the
nesting site and a couple of acres with netting and feed artificially
from the start and not trust to nature any more.

Balearica pavonina ceciliae.
By Michael J. Nicoll.
In the Autumn of 1910 a pair of Sudan Crowned Cranes
made a nest in the Giza Zoological Gardens in which two eggs were
deposited.
As the birds seemed anxious to incubate, the eggs were not
critically examined and measured although both Captain Flower and
Mr. A. L. Butler noticed that they were strikingly different from the
eggs of both the Grey and Demoiselle Cranes. At about the time
when these eggs should have hatched both of them disappeared
being probably taken by crows or rats. This year, however, a pair
of Crowned Cranes have again nested and one egg was laid in the
nest on 22 September and the next day another was found some
little distance away in the long grass. As the birds showed no
inclination to sit I put both eggs into an incubator. They proved
to be unfertile.
As the eggs of Balearica pavonina ceciliae have so far as we
can ascertain never been described I take the opportunity of publish-
ish these notes. The most remarkable feature about these eggs is
that instead of being blotched with reddish-brown as are the eggs
of the Grey Crane Grus grus and the Demoiselle Crane G. virgo
they are white very faintly washed with greenish-blue. One, the
larger, has a hard chalky coating so hard that it can only be removed
with a sharp knife. Their measurements are as follows :--
a. The egg taken from the nest
Total length .73 mm.
Total breadth .53 ,,
b. The egg found aioay from the nest
Total length .75 mm.
Total breadth .55 ,,
The great difference between the colour of the eggs of this
Crowned Crane and those of the Grey Crane is most interesting,
though it should be remembered that while the former is a resident
in the Sudan the latter is a migrant and that both the general
appearance and the habits of the two species are widely different.

SOME NOTEWORTHY EXHIBITS AT
THE INTERNATIONAL CAGE BIRD SHOW.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999497" page_id="32670090"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
In spite of the distraction caused by the War, a really
wonderfully fine lot of birds were brought together at the
Horticultural Hall, Westminster, on the 26th November : Mr. A.
Ezra's exhibition of tw T o Humming Birds causing a sensation, and
verifying my prophecy made some time ago that such a thing would
be possible. Moreover, except for the fact that the glass fronts to
their cages had an outer protection of white-painted wire bars,
which perhaps might have been removed since they obscured the
view of the birds within, the manner in which the two cages had
been prepared showed what intense care and forethought had been
bestowed.
The floors were covered with moss, whilst in each was
arranged a group of Orchids, in front of which the Humming Birds
occasionally hovered with rapidly-vibrating wings.
A thermometer fastened to the hack inside showed the tem-
perature varying from 75* to 80*, this heat being maintained by
means of night-lights placed in a special receptacle beneath the
trays. Mr. Ezra finds that these wonderful little birds should not
be kept in warmth under 70* and preferably over.
Their liquid food is the same as given to Sunbirds : but they
take it on the wing, hovering. Both of the Humming Birds received
an equal first prize, the diploma and silver medal being awarded to
the Sporctdinus mcordi, a tiny insect-like looking Humming Bird of
glittering emerald green, about which I have already written in our
Magazine, with the hopes that later on we shall be able to publish a
coloured illustration of this wonderful creature.
The Garnet-throated Humming Bird (.Eulcimpis jugularis)
seated on a hare twig projecting from among the orchids, sombre in
colour until one caught the flash of intense garnet on his throat
and breast, was also certainly worth going a long way to see.
Mr. Ezra is to be congratulated upon his success. One is sure that
such treasures mean constant care and trouble. Besides these two,
he exhibited a dainty little white-eyebrowed Blue and White Fly-
catcher, (Himalayan), a magnificent Malachite Sunbird, and the

rarer greater double-collared Sunbird as well as a fine specimen of
the Lesser Double-collared. Mr. Ezra's lovely Minla, small Minivet,
and Rufous-bellied Niltava, although these birds have appeared on
the show-bench before, were none the less worth seeing.
Lady Kathleen Pilkington sent a beautiful pair of Black-
chinned Yuhinas, charming little Himalayan birds with perky crests,
and also a lovely Blue-headed Tanager, strangely resembling the
Rufous-bellied Niltava in colouring, though rather smaller in size.
Mr. C. T. Maxwell showed a Red Sunbird (yellow rumped) in
fine colour and condition, worthy of premier honours, but unfortun-
ately having to compete against the Humming Birds, as well as the
rarer Greater Double-collared Sunbird. Mrs. Algernon Bourke's pair
of Purple Sugar Birds was very good too.

Miss M- Bousfield's Festive Tanager and Mr. 0. J. Stone's
Necklace Tanager were both good birds, losing nothing in beauty by
reason of their having been seen before.
In the class for Starlings, Jays, etc., Mr. A. Silver exhibited a
gorgeous pair of Purple-headed Glossy Starlings, which took first
prize to Mr. J. Frostick's Blue and Black Yucatan Jay, which
received second. In this class there were exhibits of Chinese Rosy
Starlings, Mrs. Thynne being awarded the premier honours of that
group (3rd prize), her bird being decidedly a finer specimen and cleaner
too perhaps than the others, which were two pairs. But all these
birds deserved some attention, although as is often the case, all could
not equally receive it. To notice other exhibits in detail, there is
neither space nor time, birds such as Mr. A. Ezra's King Paradise
Bird, Mr. W. A. Shepherd's American Blue Bird (an old favourite,
now scarely ever seen) Dr. L. Lovell-Iveay's pair of Hooded Siskins
(incorrectly described as Columbian), Mr. VY. Frost's Peter's Spotted
Fire Finch, Dr. Lovell-Keay's Rainbow Bunting, and also Mr. C. T.
Maxwell's, etc., etc., besides many Grassfinches and Waxbills,
familiar to aviculturists, but always charming
Perhaps we should also specially notice Mr. A. Ezra's pair of
Himalayan Orange-headed Bullfinches, which won well, as they
deserved to, since it was the first appearance of this species on the
show bench.

The London Cage Bird Association and the Foreign Bird
Exhibitors' League are much to be congratulated on their deter-
mination to carry out their programme of holding their show, in
spite of the general depression caused by the war, and the splendid
way in which they were supported by aviculturists proves how much
their confidence was justified. Our Editor has asked me to write a
few notes on the Parrots exhibited.
The class for Cockatoos and Macaws contained eight en-
tries. The most interesting exhibit being one of the small Macaws,
I think A. hahni, but these small Macaws, all of which are rare in
captivity are not easy to remember off hand. This bird, which was
shown by Miss Alfreda B. Smyth, took the first prize; a Bare-eye
coming second, and a very perfect Sulphur-crest third.
The next class was for Greys AND AMAZONS ; the first prize
going to a very nice Green-cheeked Amazon shown by Miss J. A. E.
Smyth ; the second to Mr. Frostick for a very fine Double-fronted
Amazon ; third and fourth to Mr. Allen Silver's Salvin's and Mealy
Amazons respectively.
Some good Blue-fronts and moderately good Greys made up a
class of no less than seventeen entries.
The third parrot class was for Lovebirds, PASSERINE, and
BROTOGERYS PARRAKEETS, and contained fifteen entries. Miss
Alfreda B. Smyth took the first prize with a very perfect pair of
Rosy-faced Lovebirds, well shown in a nice roomy cage. A pair of
Orange-flanked Parrakeets, sent by Dr. Lovell-Keays, took second
prize, the third going&amp;apos; to Mr. C. T. Maxwell for a pair of Red-faced
Lovebirds. Mr. Silver took fourth prize with a very nice pair of
Passerines, and the same exhibitor took fifth with a pair of Mada-
gascar Lovebirds.

Red-faced Lovebirds, but unfortunately they were both cocks, so had
to be passed.
The All OTHER SPECIES class as usual contained some of
the most interesting of the parrots, other than parrakeets, shown.
The Rev. G. H. Ra-yner took the first prize with a very fine pair of
Meyer's Parrakeets, both of which showed a considerable amount of
yellow on the head. Mr. Maxwell's Black-headed Caique, a very
fine specimen, came second ; and another pair of Meyer's, shown by
Miss Alfreda Smyth, third. These latter were not nearly so steady
as Mr. Rayner's pair, but it was interesting to compare them with his.
Neither showed any trace of yellow on the head, which probably
showed that they belonged to a distinct race. There are quite a
number of local races of Meyer's Parrots which differ in the amount
of yellow on the head and wings ; this character, I believe, having
nothing to do with sex and little to do with age-
The rarest bird in this class was a Short-Tailed Parrot (5th
prize) shown by Mrs. B. J. Moore, but it was not in show condition
and had an overgrown upper mandible. Other good birds shown
included Senegal Parrots, Eclectus and Red-vented Parrots.
The class for Parrakeets of the Ring-necked group, Rosel-
LAS, Redrumps, Cockatiels and CONURES, contained sixteen
entries : the first prize going to a very perfect Malabar Parrakeet
shown by Dr. Lovell-Iveays. This is a seldom imported species and
a very beautiful one. The second prize went to a very fine Red-
rump belonging to Miss Lydia Clare ; the third to a very nice
Blossom-head shown by Mr. Frost. Mr. Silver sent an unusually
fine Rosella, Mr. Erostick a very tame little Conure, which was
probably G. aztec, but off hand it is difficult to identify some of these
small Conures.
The class for LORIES, LORIKEETS and HANGING PARROTS
contained seven entries, the first prize going to Mr. C. T. Maxwell
for a specimen of the very rare Red-fronted Lory, the first I re-
member to have seen at a show. Mrs. B. J. Moore took the second
prize with a nice Ceylonese Hanging Parrot; the third to a very fine
pair of Ceram Lories shown by Mr. W. S. Smith ; the fourth to Mi-
Maxwell's fine pair of Red-collared Lorikeets.

taking first prize with a good pair of Mealy Bosellas. Mr. Frostick
second with a nice King Parrakeet ; Mr. Frost third with a Barnard,
and Mr. A. J. Shipton fourth with a Yellow*-collared Parrakeet.
Only two entries were forthcoming&amp;apos; for the last class, which
was for the rarer Grass Parrakeets, Polytelis, and so forth. They
were both valuable exhibits, a pair of Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets
sent by Miss Lydia Clare and a Bourke's Parrakeet by Miss Alfreda
Smyth. They took first and second prizes respectively.

OBITUARY.
We regret to announce the death, on the 12th of November,
of Sir WALTER Gilbey at Elsenham Hall, who had been a member
of the Avicultural Society since 1907. Well known as a great lover
of horses, he was also fond of birds, of which he had some rare
species. He found time to be a connoisseur of art, of old furniture,
silver, and china.
To the last he was slight and straight. He was wont to dress
in the style of a country squire of the early nineteenth century. He
was eighty-three when he passed away. Several of Sir Walter's
rare birds were received at the London Zoological Gardens a few
weeks before his death, including a Hunstein's Paradise Bird.

SHEARWATERS.
The Editor finds a letter in his editorial drawer written by a lady to him
on the 28th of May, in which she gives an interesting account of how she and
four companions camped out on an island off one of the coasts of England. She
wrote : " We camped out one night just to see what the birds were up to. We
reached the island about 5 p.m. and pitched our tents. Soon after dark the
Stormy Petrels began to come out, and by 10 p.m. thousands of them were flying
about in all directions. They were rather like great moths. One hit one of the
party on the head. They flew quite close to us, coming in and out from under
the stones and making a jolly sort of buzzy noise. Very soon after the Stormy
Petrels began to fly about, out came the Shearwaters. Thousands of them !
They make a weird harsh cry as they fly around, and they keep it up till the first
sign of dawn ; then all is quiet-
We turned into our tents at about 10.30 p.m., but it was impossible to
sleep ; the Shearwaters were much too noisy and they kept flopping up against
our tents and scrambling up and down them, but we did not go to the Island for
a good night's rest!
Two of us turned out at 3.30 a.m. and walked to the head of the island.
It loas lovely, with just the first signs of dawn, and the sun rose at 4.30, such a
glorious cloudless morning. We would have stayed another night if it had not
been for the very heavy dews, which came through our tents and dripped down
on us. There was a large puddle on each side, and one would have thought it had
been pouring with rain.

FOOD FOR TANAGERS IN CAPTIVITY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973938384615385" page_id="32670100"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
SIR,--Do you think you could ask some one who has had successful
experiences in keeping Tanagers to write on the subject ?
I have always found these birds a difficulty somehow, but on the other
hand I have been successful in keeping two or three in quite an unorthodox
way. For instance, a pair of Crimson Crowned Tanagers in a large aviary with a
mixed lot of Finches, Cowbirds, Buntings (Hair-crested), Cornbirds, etc. These
Tanagers used to have sop, fruit, and insectivorous food, but when placed in their
present quarters they took to seed and now eat little else ; certainly no sop or
insectivorous food, although no doubt they find a few insects. They seem to
thrive on seed diet, looking better than when fed in the usually accepted way for
this family. I am yours, etc., E. J. BROOK.
**#*** *
Dr. Butler kindly writes as follows, in answer to Mr. Brook's request :--
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.548261" genericHeader="categories and subject descriptors" page_id="32670100" page_num="80" year="" vol="">
ON FEEDING TANAGERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991089133333333" page_id="32670100"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
I feel somewhat diffident in replying to so experienced an aviculturist as
Mr. Brook, because I have only kept fourteen examples and five species, but as
our Editor has asked me to do so I will give my experience for what it is
worth.
Undoubtedly those species which approach the typical finches most nearly
(and which may perhaps belong to the Fringillidce ) do extremely well upon a seed
diet. The species of Saltator eat seed freely and doubtless could do without soft
food. I should not, however, expect to keep Euplionia, Calliste, Tanagra or
Rliamphocoelus upon a seed-diet.*
My second example of Tanagra ornata died during its autumn moult this
year ; it was one of a pair (or two) sent to me by our editor in the winter of
1903-4, and therefore had been in my possession nearly eleven years. My two
male Scarlet Tanagers were purchased in the summer of 1897 and both are still
in good health after nearly seventeen and a half years. Of course Rliamphocoelus
brazilius is one of the most easily kept of the Tanagers, but I think mine is a
record even for that species.
The food which I give consists of " Cekto " mixed with an equal quantity
of powdered chicken-meal, two hard-boiled eggs passed through a potato-masher
and double the quantity of breadcrumbs ; banana, ripe pear or orange and
grapes when obtainable ; insects or their grubs occasionally, and spiders. Upon
this diet my Tanagers have done well and it is only during the moulting-season
that they give the least cause for anxiety. A. G. BUTLER.
Mrs. Reid writes that a pair of Brazilian Hangnests ( Icterus ) have eggs
in her aviary at Funchal, Madeira, and that the birds seem to be taking matters
seriously.
* For the benefit of members to whom these names are an unknown
tongue, we may mention that Euphonia is represented by the Violet Tanager :
Calliste , by the Superb, etc. : and Rhamphoccelus , by the Scarlet Tanager.
Dr. Butler gives a description of their food, etc., in his book " Foreign Finches
in Captivity.'&amp;apos; -- E d.

An account of mine was published in the Magazine in Sept-
ember, 1911, Vol. II., 3rd Series, pp. 333, etc., of a pair of these
Grosbeaks which nested in my bird-room, but as this species has
not been illustrated I am taking advantage of the courtesy of the
Editor of Bird Lore to have a coloured plate reproduced and to write
a little more about one of the handsomest of the Grosbeak family.
Indeed, the male can hold bis own amongst a collection of many
species when in his breeding plumage, with his mixture of black,
white, and crimson.
The great ornithologist, Audubon, has written of the Bose-
breasted Grosbeak, as follows :---
" One year, in the month of August, I was trudging along the
" shores of the Mohawk River, when night overtook me. Being
"little acquainted with that part of the country, I resolved to camp
" where I was, the evening was calm and beautiful, the sky sparkled
"with stars, which were reflected by the smooth waters, and the
" deep shade of the rocks and trees of the opposite shore fell on the
"bosom of the stream, while gently from afar came on the ear the
" muttering sound of the cataract."
" My little fire was soon lighted under a rock, and spreading
"out my scanty stock of provisions, I reclined on my grassy couch
... I closed my eyes and was passing away into the world
" of dreaming existence, when suddenly there burst on my soul the

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
" serenade of the Rose-breasted bird; so rich, so mellow, so loud in
" the stillness of the night, that sleep fled from my eyelids. Never
" did I enjoy music more : it thrilled through my heart, and sur-
" rounded me with an atmosphere of bliss."
" I have frequently observed this beautiful species early in
"the month of March, in the lower parts of Louisiana, making its
" way eastward ; and when residing at Henderson in Kentucky, and
" in Cincinnati in Ohio, I have noticed the same circumstance. At
" this early period it passes at a considerable height in the air, and
" now and then alights on the tops of the tallest trees of the forest,
"as if to rest awhile. While on the wing, it utters a clear note, but
" when perched it remains silent, in an upright and rather stiff
"attitude. It is then easily approached. I have followed its
"migrations into Pennsylvania, New York, and other Eastern States,
"through the British provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia,
" as far as Newfoundland, where many breed, but I saw none in
" Labrador. It is never seen in the maritime parts of Georgia, or
" those of the Carolinas, but some have been procured in the moun-
" tainous portions of those States. I have found them rather plenti-
" ful in the early part of May, along the steep banks of the Schuylkil
" River, twenty or thirty miles from Philadelphia, and observed that
"at that season they fed mostly on the buds of the trees, their
" tender blossoms, and upon insects which they catch on the wing,
" making short sallies for the purpose."
" The most western place in which I found the nest of this
" species was within a few miles of Cincinnati on the Ohio. It was
"placed in the upright forks of a low bush, and differed so much in
" its composition from those which I had seen in the Eastern States
" that it greatly resembled the nest of the Blue Grosbeak. The
" young, three in number, were ready to fly. The parents fed them
" on the soft grains of wheat, which they procured in a neighbouring
" field, and often searched for insects in the crannies of the bark of
" trees, on which they alighted sideways in the manner of sparrows.
" This was in the end of July. Generally, however, the nest of the
" Rose-breasted Grosbeak is placed on the top branches of an alder
" bush, near water, and usually on the borders of meadows or
" alluvial grounds."

Audubon goes on to write--" I am indebted to my friend,
" John Bachman for the following information respecting this inter-
" esting Grosbeak. One spring I shot at a beautiful male of this
"species in the state of New York. [When will man learn to be
more merciful. The United States of America are now reaping the
fruits of many, many years of promisQuous and selfish slaughter,
e.c/., The Passenger Pigeon. -- E d.] " It was wounded, Bachman

" continued, in one foot only, and although I could not perceive any
" other injury afterwards, it fell from the tree to the ground, and
" before it recovered itself, I secured it. Not having a cage at hand,
" I let it fly in the room which I made my study, Before an hour
" elapsed, it appeared as if disposed to eat : it refused corn and
" wheat, but fed heartily on bread dipped in milk. The next day it
" was nearly quite gentle, and began to examine the foot injured by
" the shot, which was much swollen and quite black. It began to
" bite off its foot at the wounded part, and soon succeeded in cutting
" it right across. It healed in a few days, and the bird used the
" mutilated leg almost as well as the other, perching and resting
" upon it. I procured a cage for it, to which it immediately became
" reconciled. It ate all kinds of food, but preferred Indian corn and
" hempseed. It appeared fonder of insects than birds of that genus
" are supposed to be, and ate grasshoppers and crickets with peculiar
"relish. ... It frequently escaped from its cage, but never
" exhibited the least desire to leave me, for it invariably returned to
" some portion of the house at the approach of night."

" It's song continued about six weeks during summer, and
"about two in the autumn."
Mr. Frank M. Chapman in his book on the " Birds of Eastern
North America," writes : --
" There is no mistaking the black, white and rose costume of
" the Red-breasted Grosbeak, but the identity of his more modestly
" attired mate may long remain an open question. So little does
" she resemble him, that she might pass for an over-grown Sparrow
" with a rather conspicuous white stripe over the eye."

Mr. Bernard C. Thomasset,
" There is," adds this author, " an exquisite purity in the
" joyous carol of the Grosbeak ; his song tells of all the gladness of
"a May morning; I have heard few happier strains of bird music."
Tins is the truth. The song of this bird somewhat resembles
that of the English Blackbird ; the Ouzel with its orange bill; but
I think the key is higher and the tone sharper and more soprano.
I do not mean to say it is superior, for to my mind the song of the
Blackbird is as beautiful a song as can be heard, and none is more
mellow, more sonorous. But that of the Bose-breasted Grosbeak is
very joyous, very uplifting. When I first heard it last year coming
from my aviaries, it was a still and sunny day in February, and
the notes rang out clearly and sharply in the crisp air.
Great favourites of mine are the Bose-breasted Grosbeaks,
difficult to obtain now in England, since their exportation is forbidden,
and wisely so, by the authorities in the United States.
In the autumn the plumage of the male is dulled, the brilliant
pointed patch of cardinal-rose on the upper breast fading almost
away, and the sharply defined black with the white markings being
suffused with brown, and broken. Tbe immature male resembles
the adult female, except that her under wing-coverts are orange , his
being rose-red.
The eggs of this species .90 x .69, are from three to five in
number, pale blue with numerous olive-brown or rufous-brown
markings.

My aviary was only built, or rather adapted, in 1913, for the
shelter sheds were then pig-sties. It is of modest size and is in
some ways only a make-shift structure.
It consists of two shelters each 10ft. x 8ft. each with a flight.
12ft. x 8ft. It faces south, backing on to a large farm building.
Unfortunately the shelters are rather low, only 8ft. high at the
back and 6ft. at the eaves.

the top of the Hampshire Downs and we are subject to furious gales
and a good deal of cloud and mist, especially in winter. One would
think it a trying climate for foreign birds, but on the whole breeding
results have been good.
A pair of Long-tailed Grassfinches purchased in the summer of
1913 have fully reared seventeen young ones in a year, in four
broods.
Gouldian Finches, a Red-faced cock and a Black-faced hen,
have also done well. Turned out in the summer of 1913, they
*
remained in the aviary until the middle of last January. They were
then brought into the house and spent the next four months in
a large cage in a sitting room. There they moulted, and when
turned out in May were in perfect plumage. They went to nest almost
at once and reared six fine young birds ; this was followed by a
second brood of five, and later by a third brood of two -- all being
reared. The cock bird is a model father and took entire charge of
the young ones when they left the nest.
While the young Goulds are in the nest, the parents consume
quantities of seeding grass. The Long-tails, on the other hand,
seem to rear their chicks entirely on dry seed.
My Brush Bronzewing Pigeons have brought up three young
ones. The hen is apt to drop her eggs from a perch or on the ground
and quite a number have been thus spoilt.
Diamond Doves have had continual nests but bad luck has
pursued them. They were harried by the cock Bronzewing, and
when at length a line pair of young ones left the nest, these were
killed by that spiteful bird. Since they were removed to an
adjoining compartment, they have reared one bird, and now have
two more in the nest.
Senegal Doves. This pair of birds is very timid and they
desert nest after nest. They reared one young one until it could fly
and then left it to starve.
The only other pair of birds consists of two Green Singing
Finches. They made no attempt at nesting.

REASON IN BIRDS.

By Arthur G. Butler, Pb.D.
We who keep living birds notice many instances of their
reasoning&amp;apos; powers, not only in their capacity for learning tricks for
the gratification of their, owners ; or, in the case of talking birds, of
recognizing infallibly every member of a household by his name ; but in
the more natural power of adapting themselves to circumstances in
the construction of their nests and in learning by observation the
method by which the doors of their cages may be opened and acting
upon the knowledge obtained to the annoyance of their owners.
It used to be asserted that man differed from other members of
the Animal Kingdom in his possession of reason, all others being
guided by instinct ; but when one asks oneself what instinct is, one
is forced to the conclusion that it is neither more nor less than
inherited experience acquired through many generations of ancestors,
who have had by reasoning and experiment to solve difficulties.
As with the different races of mankind, birds are by no means
equally gifted in their power of reasoning : consequently I suspect
that there are many birds which could not be taught, like some of
the small finches and parrots, to laboriously pull up their food and
water in order to eat and drink. By the way, whenever I have seen
an unfortunate Redpoll confined in a cage measuring perhaps 10
inches by 8 in floor-space and yet obliged to work for its living, it
has always struck me as adding insult to injury. At the same time
if birds were incapable of reasoning they would never be able to learn
these futile tricks.
Once more, if Parrots were unable to reason, they would
never be able to comprehend the practical meaning of certain
sentences, such as ' Give me a bit " or " Scratch her poll " as they
undoubtedly do ; and they would certainly make mistakes in
addressing the members of a household, as they undoubtedly don't.
I am not at all certain that we don't very greatly underrate the
intelligence of parrots as regards the comprehension of the things
they say : their remarks are often most startlingly appropriate.
I have elsewhere pointed out how some of my birds, for
obvious reasons, have entirely altered their mode of nidification,

Goldfinches and others having chosen to build in a Hartz-cage,
because thus they had only to repel frontal attacks from other birds
in the aviary, whereas in a bush they would have had to be on the
alert at all points ; and of course we well know how many finches
have acquired the habit of building in boxes, whereas in their wild
state they were accustomed to building in a bush or tree ; but then
finches do not seem to be quite so conservative as other birds in their
methods of nidification since our common Sparrow is equally content
to build his orthodox bag&amp;apos;-like nest in a tree or merely to line a hole
in a bank, wall or building, with straw and feathers : and a pair of
Greenfinches which I caught nested without hesitation in a square
Canary nest-box hung on the wires of their aviary.
This year, however, I was rather astonished by the behaviour
of my female Hangnest (I discovered its sex by its dropping its eggs
to smash on the floor of its ornamental aviary): seeing that it was
apparently restlessly searching for something, I supplied it with some
long strips of bast, in the hope that it would construct a pendulous nest
from the same and that I might be able to thereby secure perfect
examples of its eggs for my cabinet. Well, at first everything looked
propitious, it took a long strip of bast and hung it over a branch of
fir (the top of a fir tree is suspended from the top of the aviary) ; it
twisted this about for a time, then pulled it out and started afresh :
presently, however, it seemed to change its mind and carried the
strip into a nest-box (cigar-box type), and after this every strip was
carried into that box and there the bird settled down, remaining in
the box incubating nothing sometimes for hours at a time.
As we well know how many of the Old--and some of the
New -- World Starlings habitually build in holes ; the question came
into my mind as to whether all Starlings originally nested in this
manner and whether it would be possible to breed them all in
this way now.
Of course the reasoning pow T ers of the Starlings are very
highly developed : I have pointed out previously that my older
Hangnest, after watching me shut and fasten the door of his cage by
turning a hook over into an eye, presently came down, passed his bill
through the wire-netting lifted the hook over, pushed open the door
and gave me twrnnty minutes hard work with a net before he could

be replaced : this he did on two occasions and his disgust w r as great
when he attempted it a third time and discovered that I had added
a second fastening to the door which he was unable to reach. This
year my younger Hang&amp;apos;nest let herself out of her little aviary in the
same way and gave me some trouble : the hook of one of the
doors had become slack and I had to bend it so that it closed with
a spring and thus she was unable to lift it as before.
Now a bird which can watch its owner when he closes the
door of its cage and say to itself " 0, that's the trick is it? I'll do
that presently and escape " is not a creature quite incapable of
reasoning ; and even those, if there be any in these days, who believe
that all created things are as they were at the beginning of the
world, could hardly assert that it acted from "blind instinct" -- a
silly expression because instinct is never blind.

In November, 1913, Third Series, Yol, V., No. 1 we published
an account, with photographs, by Mr. Collingwood Ingram, and
some additional notes by his father, Sir William Ingram, of the
Birds of Paradise which were imported by Sir William and turned
out on the island of Little Tobago.
Mr. O. Millsum has kindly sent notes of daily observations
made later on by Robert Herold, who is engaged to watch the
progress of the Apodas, and to protect them in any manner possible.
It will be remembered, by the way, that Mr. Millsum was for
some little while, up to two years ago, at Everberg in Belgium ;
where he tended the splendid collection of rare birds belonging to
Monsieur Robert Pauwels, this collection having been entirely
brought together under Mr. Millsum's direct supervision.
There is not much doubt that where once Monsieur Pauwel's
aviaries stood, destruction and desolation, as is the case over nearly
the whole of that ill-fated little country, reigns.
Mr. Millsum knows Louvain well, since it is only a few miles

There is no change in the lives of the Apodas, they are as
well as ever. In rainy weather they keep rather silent, but when it
is fine they are heard all over the island. I have kept hidden half-
way up trees, which I have climbed and which Apodas frequent, to
make sure of the right shade of colour of head and throat of females,
and I can say now with certainty that it is deep metallic indigo blue.
All other parts of the body are brown, except at the end of belly,
towards tail, a light greyish pink. I have received the colours from
Mr. Brash and I shall try to colour the sketches of Apodas the
proper shades. I shall forward sketches via New York. Fowls are
seen again now and then. I have shot three, also a shark in the

Mr. Millsum also sends an abstract of a letter written to Sir
William Ingram.
When Mr. Brash visited the island he saw several Apodas,

viz., four females in one tree, two females flying close by when
leaving&amp;apos; for another place, one male Apoda flying towards Alexandra
Road, and we heard several calls from different directions. Sitting
in the gallery of the house he saw a large male passing North-South
below house and a female later on. He also saw a female sitting
at a long&amp;apos; distance but before he could bear the glasses on it it
disappeared. There can he no mistake at all between male and
female Apodas. The male is, as you said, a larger bird than the
female, and can be distinguished from a long distance even when
flying, by its yellow colour at the back'of its head. The female is
all brown, but around the eyes and hack of head, also part of throat
there is a very deep colour which I take for very dark indigo blue.
It may be a very dark purple brown. The female bird is certainly
smaller and appears more slick. I shall write to-day to Mr. Brash
for a few tubes of colour for myself, and then I will try to send you
a coloured picture of male and female. I shall try to draw a little
sketch now.
There are certainly two distinct colours in a female Apoda,
but it is impossible to make a mistake as to the sex of the birds. I
am very sorry Mr. Brash had no chance to view a male bird at close
distance. Both males he saw T were in flight. As to the number of the
different sexes, I can state that there are six males, ten females, one
young, sex unknown. These are the numbers I can vouch for.
There may be two or three more, but there are certainly no less. It
is impossible to say that there are exactly such a number of each
sex on the island as they are never altogether to be seen and counted.
I have done all that is possible to get a clear estimate, and what I
have stated is the minimum, as I can run no chances in such an
important matter. If the birds were not so restless and would keep
together, it would not be so difficult, but they are such a disagreeable
lot of birds and never keep up friendship with each other. So they
are sometimes in pairs, mostly single and never in greater numbers
than four or five, and those are rare occasions.
I have tried to explain matters as well as I can, but hope
soon to send you sketches in colour, which will explain things better.

By Felix J. Koch.
We were standing before a cage of large, black birds in the
great City Park Zoo, out at Denver, watching the happy, chattering
creatures, seemingly having the "time of their lives," while they
flitted from bough to bough in the trees of their run, or circled round
some nests they were building.
Jack Roosa had just been commenting how lovely the birds
were -- a foot and a half in length at least : head, neck, back and
upper tail-coverts a jet black, while on the throat a stripe of grayish-
white appeared, and there was the purest of white on the scapulars.
In addition, the wing&amp;apos;-coverts played a fine shiny blue, such as the
purple-grackle will show in the sun-light. The birds appeared so
well groomed, so immaculate, little wonder Roosa was impressed.
More than that, the entire flock of them seemed so solicitious
about that nest. It was built as high up in the tree as they could
conveniently get ; withal that, in the wild state, sometimes the
birds will desert high trees for hedges--and outside there were
sharp, thorny sticks, to keep out all intruders. Inside, however, the
mother-bird had a downy bed of dry grass and roots, and, lest the
rain pour in or the wind blow down, she was now preparing to cover
this over with an intricate roof, making her entrance then at the side.
When this was completed she would lay her six or seven eggs
inside it. " Beauty is what beauty does ! " a voice remarked behind
him, as the boy concluded, " Evidently you don't know in whose
presence you are at this moment ? "
Jack flushed, wondering and puzzled : and we, -- well, we had
to admit we weren't so certain, either.
The attendant threw some food to the birds : then scenting
the chance of a " tip," perhaps, went on :--
Once upon a time -- long, long ago--a humble serving-maid
held a position in the home of a rich and powerful family. The girl
had not held her place long enough to establish her reputation com-

pletely with her mistress, when, one day, a gold bracelet was
missing."
At once we recalled the story .... in every school-reader."
Of course the maid was accused and she was condemned to
be executed -- as thieves were in those days -- in the public square.
A crowd assembled to witness the grim deed, the hangman placed a
noose about the poor girl's neck (who even here protested her
innocence) . . when, of a sudden, a bolt of lightning from the
darkening skies rent a statue on the square and as it fell. . . "
Oh, I know now . . Perce interrupted, " of course!
They found a Magpie's shattered nest and in it the missing
bracelet."
Yes, that's Mr. Magpie, and lie's as wicked a thief to-day as
he was in the centuries past. More than that, he's not at all
careful of his language." One traveller, here last summer, told of a
Magpie out before a place of business in Seward, Alaska, who keeps
calling aloud : --
Maggie's a pretty bird ; a right pretty bird ! " till a crowd
collects, and then it rounds off with an oath of a blasphemous
nature.
Jack Eoosa levelled his camera to take a picture of the
Magpies, and the keeper, slipping out a coin into his pocket, grate-
fully, drew a wallet from his inside coat pocket and produced a long
pauer.
Here's something may interest you," he said, as he pro-
ceeded to read aloud much as follows :--
The Magpie," says Montagu," is a great enemy to the
husbandman and the preserver of game, but has cunning enough to
evade their wrath. No animal food comes amiss to its carnivorous
appetite, young poultry, eggs, young lambs, and even weakly sheep
it will attempt to destroy, by first plucking out their eyes. The
young of hares, rabbits and feathered game share the same fate ; fish,
carrion, insects, fruit, and lastly, grain, when they can get nothing
else.
It is an artful noisy bird, proclaiming aloud any apparent
danger and thereby giving notice to its associates. Neither the fox
nor other wild animal can appear without being observed and

haunted ; even the fowler is frequently spoiled of his sport, for all
other birds seem to know the alarming chatter of the Magpie.
" This bird is easily tamed and chatters to those who feed
him, imitates human voices and performs many amusing tricks.
Like many of the Crow family, it has a strange desire to pilfer and
secrete small, shining objects, especially pieces of money, and in this
way is extremely mischievous when allowed to go about the house.
"The Magpie is found throughout Europe," (we remembered
one, a pet, in a hotel court at Sara, on the East Adriatic), " and is
constantly seen in the meadows and fields of England, France,
Germany and Italy. It is also abundant in the United States,
though it is confined to the western regions, that is from Texas
northward, through Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri and the British
dominions, to latitude 58.
Some naturalists suppose this must be a distinct species, as,
by a strange instinct, it remains fixed in the unsettled territories of
the West; while in Europe it seems to haunt the abodes of man. It
has, however, the same size, markings, structure and habits as the
foreign Magpie, and is, therefore, supposed to be of the same species.
Travellers in the west are sometimes very much annoyed with them,
as they will often penetrate their tents and snatch the meat from
the dishes, and if a horse chance to have a sore back, they will
descend upon it and attempt to make a meal of the living flesh ! "
That's your thing&amp;apos; of beauty, Jack," we answered, teasing,
as the man concluded.
" I don't care . . . ," Jack had his answer. "I guess I know
a pretty bird when I see one. Anyhow, here's for another snap shot
of the birds," and while the keeper took out a favourite in the flock,
let it perch on his finger and chatter at him. Jack secured the
unique picture of a real Magpie's nest in an aviary.
Where's Ethel? Nellie! Mother's in the kitchen !" then,
sub-rosa, plain and distinct as any human voice might be : " Maggie,
how's that cold ? " the famous bird of the Denver Zoo chattered.
After this he coughed, scolded and began anew till the keeper set his
tongue at rest with some coveted tit-bit or other from his pockets.

OBITUARY.
BOSCAWEN. --Killed in action on the 29 th of October, near Ypres, Second
Lieutenant the Honble. Vere Douglas Boscawen, Coldstream Guards,
third son of Viscount and Viscountess Falmouth, aged twenty four.
It is with the deepest regret that we liave to record Mr.
Vere Boscawen's death on the battlefield.
He was a member of our Society who always read the
Magazine with the greatest interest, and his intense love of birds,
and especially perhaps of Waterfowl, was a very real one. When he
first went out to the war, having a free day before going to the
fighting front, he employed his time in visiting some well-known
resort of wildfowl in France, several miles away.
His personality was full of a great charm, with a gaiety,
simplicity, and gentleness of spirit out of the common. No one
who knew him well could but feel for him strong affection. For
some weeks it was hoped that he was wounded and a prisoner of
the German army, and it was not until the second week of December
that his death was known of.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE KINGFISHER.
SIR, -- I am sure many members of the Avicultural Society will wish that
your interesting article in last month's number of the Magazine had been carried
a little further, and had indicated with more detail the methods and difficulties
of keeping Kingfishers in captivity.
I have never myself noted more than two instances of private individuals
keeping them with any measure of success, One instance was that of a man
who, after several efforts, netted in a long length of a natural stream well
stocked with small fish, and kept a Kingfisher in the enclosure ; and in this case
it is only in a limited sense that the Kingfisher could be said to be in captivity.
The other instance I have in mind was recorded at length a few years ago in
" The Fishing Gazette " where one of a pair of Kingfishers having been wantonly
destroyed, a man took the young birds and fed them for a time by hand. His
life during the period of rearing was apparently rendered more or less miserable
by having to feed at intervals nearly all the 24 hours, and if I recollect rightly he
had to provide 200 minnows a day.
It seems quite impracticable for the ordinary individual to follow either
of the above courses, and a possible solution of the difficulty to my mind would
be if young Kingfishers could be hand-reared and got on to some sort of artificial
food. I wonder if anyone has attempted this, and if so with what measure of
success. It sounds very difficult, but after seeing Mr. Wormald's famous hand-
reared Snipe I should not despair. If success could be attained it would be
worth a determined effort.
There is one paragraph in your article respecting which I should like to
offer with the greatest humility a mild friendly criticism, and that is where you
say " If the Kingfishers do prey upon very small trout, and as a rule these birds
"are to be found in the smaller backwaters where minnows abound and form
"their food, cannot some be spared for these lovely creatures?"
To cast any doubt on the destructiveness of Kingfishers to trout is to my
mind from a bird-lover's point of view adopting a position which cannot be defended
and giving the enemy an opportunity to blaspheme. Overwhelming evidence is
constantly being furnished from trout hatcheries and elsewhere as to the
destructiveness of Kingfishers to trout fry, and under natural conditions King-

fishers are habitually to be found on the small tributary streams of larger rivers,
which are just the places where trout go to spawn and where the fry are for some
months quite defenceless. If Kingfishers only fed on larger trout they would not
be so bad.
I venture to think that a safer ground of argument for preservation of
Kingfishers is that one has to choose between conflicting forms of life, and that
those who prefer Kingfishers to trout will let the Kingfishers do their worst, but
that it must be recognised that both Kingfishers and trout cannot happily exist
together. The fact that Kinfishers are often found near trout streams does not
conflict with this statement, because under present conditions Kingfishers are
kept down to a very small numbers or enormous numbers of trout have to be
supplied artifically to make up for depredations. There are a great many areas
in England where dace, minnows, etc., are found in abundance and no trout exist,
and those areas will support any number of Kingfishers.
As regards the destruction of the birds for purposes of stuffing or for
ladies' hats, surely the true ground of attack is (a; that in the words of an Eastern
proverb " A live dog is better than a dead lion," and (b) that it is uneconomic to
destroy so great a proportion of the breeding stock, which is already severely
limited by the advance of civilization. C. BARNBY SMITH.
A- % *
I was unable to indicate with more detail the best methods for keeping
Kingfishers in captivity, since I have never attempted it.
Of course Mr. Barnby Smith is correct in stating that trout fry are found
in the small tributary streams of larger rivers, since the adult fish use them for
spawning, but in a natural state of things a sufficient number must eventually
grow up to fall a prey to man instead of to the Kingfishers, setting aside the
question of minnows. When I first went to live in Berkshire, with a goodly
portion of the Kennet flowing through the property, the trout-fishing, had not
been preserved on a long reach of the river near the house, yet one could always
kill some good fish, in spite of three or four Herons and a sprinkling of King-
fishers, not to mention Otters. In former days, before trout were artificially
reared, when Kingfishers and other fish-eating birds were in greater abundance,
there must surely have always been trout, enough and to spare.
The truth is mankind is extraordinarily greedy and tenacious of what it
considers are its rights. There is oftentimes too much of the spirit which strives
to acquire and hold on to what it looks upon as having a claim to possess, which
spirit we see fully brought to bear in all its horrors by the German nation in this
wicked war. The English are, to the Germans, above all others, the King-
fishers who dare to trespass on their rights of full possession. They are not
satisfied with sufficient trout, they must have all! !

November, 1914.
.... And first of all I wish to say that I feel the time
somewhat ill-chosen to write about my birds,--when this country
still feels the tread of the German heel, and so many daily give
their lives to save it, as well as dear old England, from further
indignities. But our Editor received my promise of this little con-
tribution of mine to his great and incessant work, as many months
back as last April,--and the time has come to fulfil it at last.
It was in February last we set out for the West Indies,
intent on bringing back Humming-birds to Europe. Our success, or
rather our luck with many species of African Sun-birds, had made
us bolder, and preparations had not been spared to ensure, as we
thought, a good number of Hummers being obtained in the islands
w T e were to call at, in going and returning. I don't propose to dwell
here on the horrors of a journey that resolved itself into a succession
of gales, varied, on board, by an epidemic of small-pox among the
black soldiers bound for Martinique ; or on discomforts, personal to
myself, that resulted from my occupation of cabins which were
described as the best, yet turned out to be very much the worst for
their stuffiness and noisy position. Then, in our eagerness to obtain
the birds, we had not reckoned with such difficulties as the stupidity
of officials, native slackness and lack of initiative; and, of course,
port upon port was passed, yet no Humming Birds appeared. "It

A French Member of the Society,
was the wrong time of the year " (it always is); or the people " had
thought it useless to procure birds that could not possibly live in
captivity." etc., etc. In short, our expedition looked exceedingly like
a failure, until luck turned at last and brought better prospects. It
was March 9th, 1914, our steamer rode at anchor off the little harbour
of Basse-Terre, in the island of Guadeloupe, when at about 11 pan.
I was roused from peaceful slumbers and informed that a cage full
of Humming-birds had just been taken on the ship. They were in
a bamboo cage, about half-a-dozen of them, in fairly good condition,
being fortunately, freshly-caught birds,--most had been captured
that very day. We discovered two species : Eulampis holosericeus
and Eulampis jugularis* And gorgeous they looked under the glare
of the electric lamps in the cabin, the latter especially, in their
dress of purplish velvet, with a huge ruby shining at the throat and
sapphire at the base of the tail; their long, slender bodies and
sickle-shaped wings, clinging, bat-like, to the sides of the cage,
their tiny claws clasping its bars, wild terror reflected in
their attitude and in their brilliant eyes. In less than ten
minutes we had boiling water, and the syrup was offered them
in little tin-feeders, similar to those used for my Sun-birds.
Some would not look at it, but several, I noted with joy, soon
decided that desirable food lessens most sufferings, and were speedily
lapping it up, inserting their long, thin beaks into the small holes
provided for the purpose in the lid of the tins. A note from the
catcher, delivered with the birds, informed me that, as desired, a
pair of Banana-Quits had been obtained and put in with the
Hummers; also that I must be careful to leave the latter in their
company, as the quits would act as teachers " to the hummers,"
who, without their guidance, would not eat the food, and would
assuredly starve themselves to death. This, however, proved to be
one of the many ridiculous legends prevalent in the islands with
regard to these birds : for their greed greatly exceeds their timidity
which latter is apparent, not real, and vanishes incredibly soon, and
they generally yield to the temptations of the syrup, if they are only
held in the hand, whilst their beaks are dipped in the mixture. To

return to the Quits, a strange thing regarding them was that,
although the message mentioned two birds, only one was in the
cage as it was hauled up from the small boat that conveyed it on
board the liner. I thought that one must have in some most
unaccountable manner effected its escape,--but early the next morn-
ing, while the ship was steaming along the coast of the islands, on
her way to the next port, the smoking-room steward caught another
Quit as it flew into his bar and brought it to me. These two made
up the pair, and thrive with me to this very day : but whether
they were the two original ones, and the lost one, by calling to its
mate, effectually enticed it over from the land while we were at
anchor, or whether the second was a straggler of the wandering
type, is a problem that can never be solved, though for reasons of
romance I choose to cling to the former belief. And before I leave
the subject of my Quits, I must state they are a new importation,
quite unlike the common species (Certhiola flaveola), and belong to
a local variety known as Certhiola dominicana ,--a trifle larger than
the former, much darker on the head, and a more vivid orange on
the chest, in the case of the male. They utter a shrill, hissing,
drawn-in kind of cry, similar to the sound produced by locusts, and
to my mind equally suggestive of sultry summer days of sun-baked
lands.
The morning following the happy advent of our first batch of
Humming Birds saw us entering the palm-studded harbour of Pointe-
a-Pitre, the capital of Guadeloupe. There, owing to the epidemic of
small-pox I have mentioned, we were quarantined, and only stayed
a few hours. But a second lot of Hummers came on board. Most
of these had been caught some few days and fed according to the
recipe given. Many had become soiled with the syrup and con-
sequently looked seedy; for a hummer, as everyone knows (or
should know), depends more than any other bird on its wings.
The physical misery and discomfort caused by inability to fly, even
momentarily, means for this swift, impatient, gnat-like creature of
the air, complete immobility and often death through fretting.
However, the new arrivals were quickly cleaned, distributed
amongst the various cages, and we found we had in all a little
over twenty birds belonging to three species, thus making up the

A French Member of the Society,
complete collection of the varieties that exist in the island. Of the
third, Bellona exilis, the tiniest of all, only two or three specimens
had been captured, and of these one survived and was successfully
landed. A wonderful little fellow, hardly bigger than a bumble-bee,
yet perfect in his minute size ; a little gem clad in lavender-greys
and soft greens, with a huge helmet or topknot, flashing emerald and
sapphire lights, always alert, perky, lively as a cricket on a summer's
day, he would buzz about in his little cage, hardly ever resting, even
through the terrific storms that awaited us off the Spanish and
French coasts. After his safe arrival and for many months he was
my greatest joy, and excited the envy of all who came to see him.
Alas ! a few weeks ago, the end came : he had not moulted out
properly during the warm days, and having lost some wing-feathers,
yet not produced the new ones in good time, had lost the power to
fly, and died of no other apparent cause, early in the present month
(November), after being in my possession over seven months.
The first few days that followed our departure from
Guadeloupe, homeward bound, were days of anxiety. Some of the
Humming Birds took readily to the food and never gave any trouble ;
but others had to be fed by hand, at regular intervals, before they
made up their mind that captivity was not so bad after all and life
worth living yet. This was really hard work : for hummers appear
to need an enormous amount of nourishment, and the business of
catching each in turn and patiently holding the little creature over
the syrup until he began to sip it up, had to be unceasingly repeated.
To make matters worse, we met strong trade-winds with heavy seas
directly we sailed out of Pointe-a-Pitre. The big vessel pitched and
rocked, causing her passengers no little discomfort; then the cabin
we had chosen specially for the birds,--a large, very light room with
four windows,--from its high position on the bridge-deck, intensified
each roll of the boat; occasionally a Humming Bird would escape
from our hands, and of all ordeals perhaps this was the worst.
Imagine running, or rather tumbling, round and round a large room,
full of furniture, cages and trunks, on a tossing ship, a cloth in one
hand and cap in the other,--for we had no net,--after a bird for whom
flying is no exertion whatever, and whose firm intention next to
dodging the pursuer, is never to perch at all. Indeed, I don't know

how long&amp;apos; a Humming Bird can fly in wild life without alighting, but I
do know that it is nothing for him to keep on the wing, under the
above conditions, for half-an-hour and more. However, these and
other difficulties counted as little against the joy of observing the
little hummers' progress. After two days, all without exception
would eat from the feeder if the latter were just offered to them,--
for such was the next step to actual hand-feeding,--and after less
than a week all ate heartily and of their own accord. Of course,
there were the usual losses inseparable from the importation of
wild birds, the weaker ones dying in sad though speedy succession ;
but on the whole more than half soon settled down and could be
pronounced as saved. Meanwhile, we had reached and passed the
Azores: the weather became colder each day, necessitating the
constant use of the radiator in the room ; the wind and sea rose
higher and higher, until, when a day off Santander, we encountered
the worst storm of the journey, which went on steadily gaining&amp;apos; in
violence for the final three or four days. Days of helpless, silent
misery, during which the cages had to be lashed around the walls of
the cabin, whilst the vessel heaved in and out of the mountainous
seas, burying her nose among rollers that broke on our deck, over
the bridge, with an infernal and incessant roar. But the little
birds did not mind at all : in fact, they seemed not to notice the
motion or noise; they continued feeding&amp;apos;, humming and buzzing
through the storm quite unconcernedly. At last, about the second
half of March, after a crossing of some ten days from Guadeloupe,
we reached our port of destination. A motor, which awaited us at
the docks, conveyed the cages, carefully wrapped up in thick
flannels and warmed by several hot-water bottles, to a heated and
reserved compartment in the train; our troubles were over, and
success achieved so far.

Pceocephalus fuscicollis.
By Hubert D. Astley.
In the Avicultural Magazine of Feb., 1910, Dr. Hopkinson
gave a most interesting account, accompanied by an excellent
illustration of what someone was pleased to entitle as the Brown-
necked Parroc, which someone must have been completely colour-
blind. To begin with there is no brown about the bird at all, and
secondly why " brown-necked " ? for the whole head and neck to the
shoulders is of the same colour, a difficult colour to describe I
admit; but it is no more brown than it is blue or yellow ! I should
venture to call it silvery-grey, suffused with dull rose pink, that is to
say each dull pink feather seems to have a silvery grey edging.
" Silvery-headed " would have been nearer the mark. But there it
is, some birds have names which make one wonder whether those
who christened them were not what is called " ga-ga."
Now Dr. Hopkinson described this Parrot not only as
difficult to keep alive but also as untractable, a biter and a screecher.
Indeed any aviculturist after reading his most interesting article
would undoubtedly say " Thank you, no Brown-headed Parrot for
me." Have I found the exception to prove the rule ? Mr. Cross
wrote to offer me one which he said was very tame and had evidently
been made a pet of. Mike arrived on the 29th September, 1914, and
was consequently, without much self-congratulation as to originality,
christened after the archangel.
And Mike is quite worthy of taking his place in St. Michael's
angelic hosts, for wings he has, and an angelic temper too.
He's never happy unless he can sit on my shoulder, delighting
in being handled, and making no end of a fuss when in his cage
until one takes him out.
As yet he doesn't talk, but he tries his very best, and can
imitate the sound of kissing and other such canoodling noises ; but
scream --never once have I heard him.
And he's a very gay spirit too, nothing morose, nothing
stupid about Mike, with his dark brown eye full of intelligent
expression.

Let me remind others, or inform them as the case may be,
that he has for first cousins such things as the Grey Parrot,
Jardine's and Meyer's, and that his native home is Africa, in the
Gambia. As Dr. Hopkinson has told us, and as the illustration
facing p. 107 of Yol. I., 1909--1910, will show you, this Parrot's
bill is abnormally large, which feature one grows accustomed to in
time, ending by thinking that this fine development of the nasal
organ lends dignity, and if he took snuff what a fine pinch he could
put in, not that he couldn't put that in anyhow.
[Who was it, bye-the-bye, who on being offered a pinch of
snuff by the Eegent, answered, "I thank your Eoyal Highness, but if
" the Almighty had intended me to take snuff, he would have
"turned my nose up the other way."]
My Parrot, I suppose I must say Brown-necked Parrot,
is a frugal eater, but makes no fuss about not being supplied with
ground-nuts. He partakes of a Parrot mixture of various seeds,
drinks water and eats apples.

There are some sins of which one never sincerely repents,
and in my case one of these is the awful waste of time spent
in watching game and marsh birds with nests or young.
There is for me a fascination about this, quite out of all
proportion to possible benefits derived for aviculture.* During
the past season I have watched several interesting nesting failures
in my garden, and give notes of five such.

desire to nest. I accordingly placed them in a small grass run
apart from other birds, and they very soon made a small " scrape "
for a nest quite close to where the gate of the run opened. I knew
this would never succeed, and after some trouble induced them to
adopt a better nesting site, where four eggs were laid. My hopes
were then great, but, alas, a small rat managed to squeeze into the
run and accounted for all the eggs. I shortly afterwards took out
the parent birds and foolishly placed them in a run with some other
non-nesting Cayenne Plover. The hen was killed within four hours,
and the cock had to be taken out (a disreputable looking bleeding
object) to recover in solitude.

2. My Glossy Ibis make some half serious attempts at
nesting every summer, but so far it has always been a case of
" much cry and little wool." I have provided them with a large
nesting platform about four feet from the ground and consisting
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941556090909091" page_id="32670150"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
of wire netting (slightly dished) covered with birch twigs and
rushes, and I always give fresh loose material each season. This
season the nesting operations extended from mid-April to the end
of July--both cock and hen continually moving the twigs and
rushes and piling them into a little heap in one corner of the
platform. They would often both seize the same twig and pull in
opposite directions with small net result. At other times the cock
would stand on the edge of the nest with his back feathers stiffly
erected and with repeated bowings of the head and loud croaks
call upon the hen bird to come and join him at the nest. Both cock
and hen spent much time sitting on the nest, and in the end four
eggs were laid at considerable intervals of time. One of the eggs
(a soft one) was laid on the ground. The cock bird especially
seemed wildly excited over the other three eggs, and (with curiously
misplaced energy) would never allow them to remain in the nest,
but repeatedly pushed them with his beak out of the nest, and
occasionally, off the platform altogether. I tried replacing several of
them, but without the least good result. The birds are in pei'fect
health and quite tame. I much wish they were either less perverse
or I understood better their normal nesting habits. I have asked a
gentleman in the south of Spain if my methods could be improved
to ensure the Ibis nesting better, but he says the nest provided he

thinks should meet the case judging from the habits of wild Ibis
nesting in his vicinity.
3. I keep one pair of Californian Quails, and the hen bird
this spring laid over twenty eggs in one corner of the shelter shed.
These were all taken away by me, and she immediately started
a nest by a tuft of grass outside and laid eighteen more eggs. Six
of these being removed, she sat closely on the other twelve eggs and
hatched twelve healthy chicks, of which eight were safely reared.
The pride of both parents in the young hatched w r as intense. The
hen could not easily brood such a large family, so the cock would
constantly sit alongside and brood such chicks as failed to find room
under the hen. He varied this peaceful domestic occupation by
occasionally charging violently at my feet as I left the run. The
habits of young Californian Quails are most pretty, and I do not
think there are any more interesting small game birds, except
perhaps young Chinese Quails, which it has never been my good
fortune to see.
4. When I left home for Iceland early last June, I had what
I hoped was a true pair of Australian Pectoral Rails nesting in a
grass tuft in a small run. One bird was " sitting like a stone " on
four eggs, and I hoped for good results. Unfortunately, a rat made
an inroad during my absence and killed the sitting bird. On my
return, I found that owing to this and other tragedies things had got
rather mixed, and the surviving rail had been moved into a larger
run (about 9 yards by 16 yards) where there were a lot of other
Waders, including another Pectoral Rail. The surviving Rail was
sitting closely in a tuft of grass on eggs believed by my man to
be six in number. Thinking these eggs were certainly all clear,
I somewhat stupidly had the bird frightened off the nest and
gave instructions for the eggs to be put on a table in the potting
shed to present to a schoolboy in due course. When the man went
to the nest for the eggs only four were found, although six had
previously been seen. As these Rails are always destroying their
eggs, this was not surprising. The eggs were removed at 9.30 a.m.
on Tuesday, 14th July--at 2.45 p.m. the same day, my man heard a
chick trying to break through the shell of one of the eggs removed.
He at once took all four eggs back to the nest and then discovered

that the two missing eggs had previously been converted into two
little balls of black fluff, and the old bird had taken these chicks
back to the nest and was brooding them there. The four eggs were
replaced in the nest, and the following morning two more chicks
were hatched (the other two eggs being clear).
The difficulty of feeding the chicks then commenced. In
the first place, it was often most difficult even to find the parent
birds, and when found the chicks for the first few days would
scatter in all directions more often than not making frantic efforts
to get through the f-in. mesh wire netting enclosing the run, and on
various occasions I rescued chicks that had pushed through and
failed to return. The parent birds would at my approach display
the greatest agitation--the cock very slightly setting up his feathers
and rushing off with loud " clacks " of indignation, whilst the hen
with similar "clacks" and with lowered head and wings, and
feathers on the back erected, would repeatedly charge at me,
especially if a chick w T as heard to cry. It would be of great interest
to have had a photograph of the hen Rail while charging She
looked something like a Ruff in the breeding season, and the greatest
possible contrast to the torpedo-shaped bird as I usually see her at
other seasons, shrinking away through the grass at the slightest
noise. The cock bird usually kept quite near the hen, but I never
actually saw him brooding the chicks. For a fortnight I spent a good
deal of time throwing crumbled hard-boiled egg, scalded gentles, finely
chopped meat, poultry food and other dainties in open spaces where
I hoped the Rails and not other birds would find them. It was
most interesting when I could watch unseen to notice the hen bird
coming out to fetch pieces of this food or catching flies with which to
feed the young. I could always tell when the young were near, and
I was unnoticed, by her constant low " grunts " calling them--a
striking contrast to the angry " clacks " of one or both parents as
soon as danger was suspected. One of the chicks died at the end of
about a w r eek and one when partly feathered. The other two
flourished greatly, but just before getting feathered were the ugliest
birds I ever saw in my life. The down with which they were
hatched did not seem to have increased at all, and as the birds grew
prodigiously they became straggling, black-skinned, semi-nude objects.

I often failed to find one or other of them for a week or so at
a time, and it was interesting to notice that the young birds and
their parents made long tunnels in the coarse-growing grass all over
the run, as though the place had been infested with rats. A system-
atic hunt by several persons with sticks to poke in every tuft of
grass was the only way of ascertaining what birds were there. The
greatest care had to be exercised to avoid treading on the chicks.
5. I have written so often about the nesting of my Tree
Partridges that I will now only add a short note as to a pair of
these birds that spent the whole of last summer in vigorously
making and pulling to pieces at least twenty nests, laying in several
a few eggs which I took to the incubator. On the 13th August, the
hen commenced to sit on four eggs in a nest deeply scooped out in
the ground and so covered that she was, when sitting, almost
invisible. She sat twenty-six days, and to my surprise then brought
off four chicks. I have never previously known eggs of Tree
Partridges take so long to hatch. When the hen bird finally brought
off the chicks and I went to investigate, the cock came flying almost
into my face from the other side of the run with a wild shriek and
thereafter evinced the greatest excitement when I approached the
hen and chicks and often made frantic efforts to lure me away.
The weather for the first week was unusually cold and two chicks
died. I put the other two with the parent birds into my sand-
grouse shed (a wooden shed facing south with sand floor and glass
shelter in front). They flourished well there, being fed on well
cleaned gentles and small seeds. Of course, turf ground would have
been more ideal, but then Tree Partridges should not hatch in

By E. J. Brook.
I have often thought that one of the most critical times of
the year for small birds in aviaries with outdoor flights was late
autumn and early winter. I have been greatly puzzled over this as
cold could not be held accountable when the birds were shut into

Mr. E. J. Brook,
warm quarters. Neither coulcl want of exercise hurt the birds
when the compartments they were shut into were large and gave
ample room for flight.
Then, again, I have often been under the impression that this
critical period was less noticeable one year than another with
exactly the same class of birds. This year I have had considerable
trouble with my smaller Sunbirds and Tanag&amp;apos;ers. These birds were
in splendid condition when it became necessary to shut them in for
fear of cold winds and heavy rain. I thought what a splendid store
of health they had accumulated against a long winter. All the long
summer and early autumn these birds had lived a life of practical
freedom, feeding from the flowers that adorned the beds and pillars
in the flights and the innumerable midges and other small insects.
So much natural food did my Sunbirds get that they required very
little artificial food for nearly four months. Then came the order to
close the windows and shut up for the winter, and none too soon, for
that very night the wind changed. The temperature fell and a
much wanted rain came at last.
Now, instead of the birds that up to this time had looked so
well, continuing in this state of health, those that had not quite got
over the moult looked dull and dry in their plumage, in fact, they
were stuck in the moult I should say. I did all I could to
mend matters but evidently the sudden change from a natural diet
to an artificial one was too much for their constitutions and I lost
some of them. The larger Sunbirds and those over the moult did
not seem to suffer. From what I have seen of a large collection of
Sunbirds kept in an indoor aviary and in cages and that never get out
into the open, I am inclined to think that the smaller species will do
best in large cages where they can take exercise and are kept on the
same food all the year round. Kept in this way there is no sudden
change from one mode of life and feeding to another, and they are
therefore safer.
While on this subject, I might mention my experience of the
Sugar Birds. The Yellow-winged I have never had much trouble
with and I have also found the Black-headed easy to keep, but the
Purple has given a lot of trouble and so has the Blue ( D. cay ana).
I think perhaps the Purple is inclined to get fat and possibly the

Blues are the same, as they seem to be greedy birds. I have had a
number of Yellow-wing&amp;apos;s and nearly all have died of what I believe
to be nothing but old age. The reason I think this, is that I have
noticed as a rule those that have died have failed to go into eclipse
plumage at the proper season for this change. When one of these
birds has not made the seasonal change, it has, though perfectly
healthy in appearance and continuing in brilliant plumage, died
shortly before the next moult. I can only conclude that when they
do not g&amp;apos;o into the eclipse plumage this is a sign that their period
of usefulness is over and they are no longer wanted.
I may mention that I do not think any of my Sugar birds
have suffered from being suddenly deprived of their garden flight,
but perhaps none have been in the moult at that time.
Of all the vicious little brutes I have ever kept I think Sun-
birds are the worst. Some of them will attack almost anything
I believe. I have a hen Zeylonica that has seriously maimed
Tanagers more than twice its size. I have now placed this little
pest in a compartment with Peach-faced Lovebirds and I have seen
the Lovebirds move from a branch where the Sunbird wanted to be.
The Sunbirds nearly always injure each other with a vicious blow
with the beak on the front of the skull causing a fracture or serious
damage to the scalp. A fight begins without any warning and
between birds that have lived for months in perfect peace and a hen
or cock is quite as likely to attack one of the other sex as one of its
own. Pairing seems to be a matter of selection on the part of the
birds rather than a matter of chance. Probably age has a good deal
to do with this. I have only had one pair that really paired and
they were most affectionate and nested, but all other pairs that I
have selected as likely to breed have lived in a sort of armed truce
which has eventually ended in a fight.

SOME PRACTICAL REMARKS ON
PRACTICAL AVICULTURE.

<bodyText confidence="0.996838909090909" page_id="32670156"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
By Dr. L. Lovell-Keays.
The title of my paper sounds rather comprehensive and I
trust will prove not only so but also comprehensible. Although
I have been interested in aviculture for just about twelve years,
I have only taken it up seriously for about eighteen months.
During that time certain facts (and I fear fancies) have impressed
themselves on me and I feel, or at any rate hope, that committing
them to writing may be of some interest, if not a little help, to
others. I have had to learn so much by experience that I am sure
others have had to learn by experience too, and I feel it is a pity that
other beginners should also have to tread the beaten track of
experience and have to learn by their own mistakes instead of
profiting&amp;apos; by the mistakes of others. This is by way of introduction
and apology for expressing my views at all in print. Please do not
think I have not had a great deal of advice, a considerable amount of
help and ever so much enjoyment from other and more experienced
aviculturists. Among aviculturists there is a true bond of brother-
hood, and by far my most interesting correspondence is my avicul-
tural correspondence. But I have constructed aviaries of various
types, kept birds of various sorts and had failures of varying kinds.
If ever I build fresh aviaries I shall bear my past experiences in mind.
I propose in this article, or series of articles, to deal, in
the first place, with aviaries and their construction : in the second
place with foods and their preparation ; and in the third place with
birds and their reception and treatment. I do not intend to deal
with either section at great length, and I fear many of my deductions
will appear false, and I am sure many will disagree with me in some
of the things I shall say. In aviculture, as in all other sciences, it
is indeed a case of " Quot homines tot sententicie" and I have no
mandate from the Oracle at Delphi which could lead me to imagine
I am infallible. For all my fallibilities I ask forgiveness, and for all
my ignorance I crave indulgence.
I have seen many aviaries, but I have yet to see the perfect

one, and I certainly have yet to construct it. It is no concern of
mine to give plans or elevations of aviaries here, but I wish to draw
attention to certain obvious defects of my own. I have, I believe,
what one may call twelve or fifteen aviaries, bird rooms, and so
forth. Only one has a brick floor and is brick built as regards the
shelter. It is quite unheated. It is lofty, well ventilated and well
lighted. Moreover, it has an east window, and I take it that in the
dreary half-lit days of winter, the early morning sun must bring
cheer to the hearts of our feathered pets. I should like to have an
east window in every aviary of mine. For it is in the winter our
birds require most thought, for in the summer birds will do anywhere.
My east window is double and measures three feet square. It is on
a level with the main perching accommodation, and I put the food
quite close to the window so that birds may get food as soon as
dawn has arrived. The double window is to prevent too rapid
irradation of heat. The air space between acts as a non-conductor
and so prevents the draught that is inevitable even with a closed
and perfectly fitting window. I have all my shelters whitewashed.
It is lighter, cleaner, and shows the dirt, besides which the whiting
is good for the birds. In this aviary there is a good sized door above
which I have had a glass door fitted which opens inwards. This is
the main entrance for the birds and can be easily closed from the
outside by a piece of string without the aid of pulleys or other
devices. The frame of the door is between the birds' entrance and
the door itself and birds are very fond of alighting on that before
they make up their minds where they want to go, either on going in
or out. Then this ledge is well protected from rain and I put sop or
soft food on it during bad weather, for to move the food from right
outside to right inside might cause a bird to die from being unable
to find it. The door itself I have cut in half and had the upper
part glazed for purposes of light. By having the door cut in half I
can get in and out in severe weather without letting the birds out.
It is not much of a stoop this 3ft. 6in. and I have never had a bird
get past me yet. All the doors open inwards, you can push your
way in and fill up the space with your body.
In this aviary, I can and do drive in my birds every evening
at sunset, or earlier if necessary during the winter. It takes three

nights to train the birds to go in--never more. " Your birds must
be very wonderful," you say ; until you see this aviary and then you
realise that when driven the birds must go in, because birds when
frightened always fly to the top, and birds when driven always fly
away from the driver. Ergo, if the entrance to the shelter is at the
very top of the flight and in one corner, the birds have nowhere
else to go. I have tried to drive birds in in other aviaries, and when
thoroughly exasperated given it up as a bad job.
In another aviary the flight is 8 feet high, and the shelter
slopes down from a wall towards the flight and is only 6 feet 6 inches
in height. The consequence is that the wire work has to be carried
up from the top of the shelter to the level of the flight, and although
this slopes it makes no difference, and when I drive or attempt to
drive the birds in they merely cling to the wire-netting. It is only
a little point, but it becomes important if you want to catch a bird
up or to drive them in in very bad weather, and so on; and to my
mind an aviary in which you cannot easily drive the birds in is
not perfect.
As regards the floor of the shelter, I need hardly say that a
cement floor well covered with sand is to be infinitely preferred to
the ordinary earth or even brick floor, and where the extra cost
is not of great moment, there should be no corners, but the floor
should be sharply curved at the junction with the walls. This
is the only way you can be sure of keeping your shelter free from
dirt and its attendant satellite disease. The further advantage of
cement floors is that you can exclude mice. It should not be
within the province of this paper to warn my readers against the
evils of draughts. And yet I have seen aviaries where one can see
daylight at the eaves. Birds will roost in the eaves ; often people
wonder that their birds get pneumonia, or in bad cases, won't use
the shelter at all. I encourage the birds to use the shelters for
feeding in and nesting in. How often do we hear of nestlings being
drowned out. But en passant, let me make a suggestion. In the
inner flight, when you are expecting young to leave the nest, get
some nice leafy boughs and put them in the flight several days
before the young are expected. By that time the old birds will have
got used to the presence of these boughs and have lost their inquisi-

tiveness over them, and then when the quasi-helpless young birds
leave the nest they will have some cover to hide in. I experienced
the loss of a young bird the other day owing to the lack of cover in
the shelter.
Two Avadavats left the nest. One was stronger on the wing
than the other, but both were attacked most unmercifully by Green
Avadavats, other Red Avadavats, Bib Finches and several other
small birds. The one that was able flew out into the flight where
there is a superabundance of cover, but the other was not able to
manage it, and the latter, although it had the protection of the
shelter and its crop was quite full, was dead the next morning,
bullied to death; whereas the former is now fending for itself
although we had frost on each night succeeding its plunge into the
outer world. With regard to nesting accommodation, I can only
make a passing remark and that is :--Don't put them where they
make obvious alighting places for birds coming in and going out, and
don't imagine birds prefer a dark dungeonlike sort of corner to
nest in. My birds like to have the entrance to the nest in a good
light and I have noticed that they nearly always prefer to use a
nesting receptacle that faces the light rather than the reverse.
There is one point about my main Finch aviary that I
have repeatedly found invaluable and always found useful. The
inner flight of my new Finch aviary is the same breadth as the
outer flight, and the shelter is entered from the outer flight. The
passage divides the two inner flights and merely consists of wire
mesh partitions. In this aviary, which was built against a south
brick wall, the roof slopes upwards to the back, and is thereabout 8
feet high. Against the wall at the back I have had fixed a kind of
square tunnel, but with the front made of wire work and made so as
to open outwards. I thus have an easy means of communication
between flights A and B. At the same time it takes up no useful
room, being overhead. By means of sliding shutters I can instantly
clear the tunnel at either end, i.e., at HK or LM. The object of this
is as follows : In the first place I can use either flight separately or
as one large flight. Thus I can drive all the birds into flight A
and clean or repair flight B, or I can keep flight A shut up and
allow flight B to remain open to the outer flight, and so on.

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays,
But the chief use of these sliding doors is to catch up parti-
cular birds. Having ascertained that the particular bird I want is
in the shelter, I close all the windows and find, perhaps, two dozen
birds shut up. I roughly divide them into two flocks, one in flight
A and the other in B. Then I close one or other of the sliding
doors in my tunnel. The birds not wanted are let out into the
flight to save them from being frightened. I then open the door
leading from the inner flight to the passage and drive out some of
the captives into the passage. If my bird is not there (and I
endeavour to keep it in the flight as long as I can) I simply shut the
door into the passage and open the door into the outer flight. By
this means I eliminate the unwanted birds. If, however, the bird I
want gets into the passage, I can always separate it from the others,
and then pushing open the door between the passage and the inner

flight, let the unwanted birds return to the inner flight. I am then
in this position, the wanted bird is in the passage and all doors are
shut. I let down the sliding door of the tunnel and allow the
unwanted birds to escape if they like. I then catch up the bird I
want by hand. It all sounds very complicated, but in reality it is
quite easy and takes far less time than it takes to write a description
of the method. I have never failed to catch any given bird within
ten minutes, provided I can get it in the shelter to begin with.
And in the winter, when one cannot have the birds out of doors at
all, it is just as easy to single out a bird and catch it, but one has,
of course, to slightly modify one's plan of campaign. By this means
one avoids rushing round the flight making wild dashes for the bird
with a butterfly net. I have found it an inestimable boon on many
occasions.

I have still another use for my tunnel. I can, by fixing a
lamp underneath it and covering the outside of the floor with sheet
zinc, use my tunnel as a hot air chamber for ailing birds and many
a bird's life has been saved in that tunnel.
These uses are not imaginary or illusory. They have been
thoroughly tested and proved absolutely reliable and practical.
Athough this is one of my largest aviaries, I can catch birds more
easily in this than in any other, simply because of this overhead
communication between the two inner flights. As regards furnishing
the shelters, last year I provided one with nice twiggy branches but
bare, and the other with hazel boughs with the leaves on. The
leaves were a great success and provided cover for the small birds,
affording protection from bullies, and the birds relished the leaves
as sheltering places to roost amongst.
As regards vertical or horizontal branches, I rather incline to
the latter, but I employ both kinds. Perches are taboo with me
with certain exceptions. With reference to lighting the aviaries
during the winter, I am inclined to think it is waste of light. The
great majority of birds go to bed at sundown and rise at dawn and
eat nothing between. I give it as my opinion, and therefore only
for what that is worth, that birds suffer no hurt from the prolonged
abstinence during the winter nights. The subject is too big to
discuss in a paper of this kind, but I am prepared to back my
opinion by facts.
Many people are fearfully against ledges. I never could
make out why, except that they get dirty. True, but they can be
cleaned and kept so, and there is nothing a bird loves so much as
a ledge. I suspect it rests the flexor muscles of their legs.
I must leave the shelter or inner flight and pass on to the
flight proper. The dimensions of this must depend largely upon
the room you have, the money you are prepared to spend upon it,
and upon individual tastes in general. A lofty flight has much to
recommend it and everything from a bird's point of view. It may,
of course, double your cover, and you can grow decent trees and
shrubs in it, but if you ever want to catch up a bird in a great lofty
flight, the trouble then begins. My flights are practically 8 feet
high throughout, and I find that a very convenient height. It gives
</bodyText>

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays
the birds room to fly over one's head and so ease panic, and one
can drive the birds towards a given point at this height. Nests are
easy to get at and the cost is not too great. The moment you get
over 8 feet you will find the cost increases almost " in proportion
to the square of the height " as the mathematicians say. The
supports of my aviaries are all chestnut poles, and the builder, a
sound practical man, assures me that chestnut will last 15 or 16
years in the ground and far out-live oak or any of the fir tribe.
Iron is of course much more durable but much more expensive.
Creepers (such as Honeysuckle, Clematis, etc.), do not like metal to
climb up. Metal is such a good conductor of heat that the plants
experience and suffer from great variations of temperature, much to
their detriment. Wood has this advantage too, and that is it is
more picturesque. Moreover you can drive nails into it. Another
point is that wood harbours insects,--an advantage it is impossible
to over-rate. I have been asked what kind of evergreens birds
prefer. I have tried most kinds and I find the most favourite
kinds are the Retinosporas and the Kryptomerias amongst the
conifers. Laurels, Privets, are useful too, but in every aviary I
would see planted an Elder. They are full growing, afford good
shelter and are quite impossible to kill. Apart from the insects the
flowers attract, the tree itself generally teems with insect life, and
the berries too are greedily eaten by numbers of birds. Then
Wichuriana Roses such as Dorothy Perkins, Hiawatha, and the
most vigorous of all, Evangeline, may be planted, besides Honey-
suckles, Clematis, and so on to the fancy of the aviculturist.
Certain plants I shall touch on when dealing with pods, but
mention must be made of Docks Plantains, Milk or Sow Thistles,
one or two of the Umbelliferae such as Cow Parsley, of the Com-
positae as Michaelmas Daisy, and lastly of the Trumpet Honey-
suckle (j Eccremocarpus Scccber). The dwarf perennial grasses or the
so-called " flowering grasses " must certainly have a place, and the
usual garden weeds such as Shepherd's Purse, Groundsel, Chick-
weed, and so forth. Lastly, in our flight we should all have a bird
bath as designed and described by Mr. W. T. Page. Nothing adds
such joy to the aviary or fascination for the aviarist as a properly
constructed bird bath. They are simple shallow depressions in the

ground li inches deep in the centre and shelving away to nothing
at the edges. The drain cock in mine is nothing more than the
mouth and neck of a druggist's wide mouth bottle and a bung fitted
to it. Being glass it is clean and no fear of verdigris or metallic
poison. The cost of the drain cock was of course to me nil. Before
leaving our flight, I would draw attention to the absolute necessity
of an entrance lobby. Ever so small will suffice. It prevents the
loss of birds through escape, and if one does get out through a hole
anywhere or by some unforeseen accident, it is usually easy to catch
them in the lobby, and I have known several instances where stray
birds have been caught in the lobby. Then one word as regards
the doors. All outer doors leading to the lobby and the lobby door
above, should be fitted with a powerful spring. I have found the
vertical coil spring the most efficacious for outdoor work, and it
is quite inexpensive.
Those of our readers who read the writer's articles on Cactus
Conures will recollect the mention made of eaves. Eaves are a
supplement to, and not a substitute for, a proper shelter. All birds
are fond of eaves both for roosting and nesting. Wherever I have
a wooden partition between two aviaries there you will find a row
of eaves and there you will find the birds sheltering during the wet
and often roosting at night. In flights which are much exposed, it
is a good plan to have a row of short boards along the top of the
flight about 2 feet deep with eaves attached and under the eaves an
assortment of branches. In such a case, each end of the eaves
should be closed and so make a snug shelter for the birds. In
my parrakeet aviaries I have hung perches from side to side the
whole width, and at the far end of the flight, protected above and
outside by match-boarding. This is by far the most favourite rest-
ing place for the parrakeets, protecting them as it does from the
hot sun, the prevailing winds (S.W.) and also of course from the
rain. Transverse perches are almost a necessity for the Platycerci,
if one is to have regard for their feet. Climbers and creepers are
not possible in a parrakeet aviary. By the way, there appear to be
two things parrakeets don't destroy, and they are Stinging Nettles
and the Common Bindweed.

[A letter addressed in French to M. A. GEOFFEOY SAINT-HlLAIRE, director of
the Zoological Gardens of Paris, and translated by HUBERT D. ASTLEY.]
London, 31 Oct., 1882.
Deab SlB,---You have asked me what is the number of Im-
peyan Pheasants (Lophophorus refulgent ,) and Tragopans (Geriornis
satyr a) which I have imported from India. I have consulted my
notes and my memory, and I give you below the information that
you wish for. In 1864, I sent from Calcutta by the Cape of Good
Hope, 20 Impeyan Pheasants, seven birds having arrived alive after
a voyage of 120 days.
In 1865, by the same route, I sent 50 Impeyans ; all suc-
cumbed.
In 1866, still vi&amp; the Cape of Good Hope, I sent 117 Impeyan
Pheasants and Tragopans. All perished on the way.
In 1867, my consignment w r as sent by what is termed the
land route, that is by railway from Calcutta to Bombay, by sea
from Bombay to Suez, by rail from Suez to Alexandria, by sea from
Alexandria to Marseilles, or Trieste, or direct to London. I sent
300 Impeyan Pheasants and Tragopans. Eleven birds arrived alive
after forty-two days' journey.
In 1868, by the same route, I sent 285 Impeyan Pheasants
and Tragopans; of which 40 were landed alive.
In 1869, my birds came by the Suez Canal, and since then
all my consignments have followed this route.
Out of 100 Impeyans and Tragopans which were sent, 40
arrived in good health.
In 1870, out of 180 Impeyans and Tragopans, 16 arrived.

In 1871, out of 120, I received only 16.
In 1872, out of 20 pairs of Impeyans, only four birds arrived.
In 1873, out of 80 Impeyans and Tragopans, twelve only
arrived alive.
In 1874, 40 Impeyans were despatched. Thirty-one arrived
in good condition, which I sold to you.
In 1875, out of 80 Impeyans and Tragopans sent off, 70
arrived.
In 1876, I had 40 Impeyans and 25 Tragopans put on board
ship, of which 31 of the former and 21 of the latter arrived.
In 1877, the 80 Impeyans and the 70 Tragopans sent off, all
arrived alive.
In 1878, out of 70 Impeyans and 50 Tragopans, I lost only
six of the latter.
In February, 1879, 60 Impeyans and 70 Tragopans were
despatched, all of which arrived safely.
In March of the same year, a fresh consignment of 40
Impeyans and 20 Tragopans were dispatched, none of which perished
on the journey.
The year 1880, was full of incidents. After almost insur-
mountable difficulties I became possessed of the first Hastings'
Tragopans (Geriornis hastinqii).
All shooting having&amp;apos; been forbidden during the space of five
years in the country under British rule where the Impeyans, Hast-
ings' Tragopans, Wallich's and Pucrasian Pheasants, are met with ;
I had to push my researches in the independent territories, and
consequently at great distances from my ordinary centre of action.
The captured birds reached Dharmsala (Punjab) after having
being carried for many days on men's backs through country
covered with snow. Fourteen pairs, and twelve males of Hastings'
Tragopans, reached our aviaries. After three days journey by
carriage they arrived at the nearest railway station, and after a
week's journey reached Calcutta.
All these birds came to Europe safely and in good condition.
At the same time I imported 32 pairs of Pucrasian Pheasants and
two Wallich Pheasants.

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
dens, took ten pairs of Pucras Pheasants ; the others going to
various amateur aviculturists. I could not look after all the cap-
tured birds, for there were more than I had room for, and also, I had
left behind one of my men, who came on a month later with 60
pairs of Impeyans, 90 Trag&amp;apos;opans ( Satyra ), 24 pairs of Polyplectrons
(Chinquis ) and 7 male Sumatran Pheasants ( Euplocamus ignitus)
which were the first to be brought over.
My man arrived with 54 pairs Impeyans, 67 Tragopans
(Satyra), 18 pairs of Polyplectron chinquis, and five male Sumatran
Eire-tailed Pheasants.
Prince Dhuleep Sing, residing in England, took the greater
number of the Impeyans ; which, I am told, were turned out in the
Maharajah's coverts. In that same year, 1880, I was able to im-
port ten Elliott's Pheasants, four males and two females, seven

She has Fellowes' Syrup in her water always ; no hemp in the seed mix-
ture, but a little Sunflower seed, and also some sopped biscuit and water, in
which I was advised to put a few drops of Cod Liver Oil, but that ended the sop,
so I have put a little salt butter in it, which she loves, and a bit of butter on
toast is a delight. Spray millet she likes, and she eats well, Sometimes a little
powdered sulphur is dusted over her skin, but it does not seem to be beneficial.
% 3?
The following reply has been sent to Miss Drummond :
I am afraid that there is no certain remedy for feather-plucking in parrots,
It is generally brought about by dryness and irritation of the skin consequent
upon indigestion due to incorrect feeding, though in a few instances it results
from the presence of parasites.
Sometimes, if treated when it first starts and before it has become a habit,
correct feeding and a little of Dinneford's Fluid Magnesia in the drinking-water
for a few days have a beneficial resnlt; as also turning the bird loose in a densely
planted aviary where its attention is diverted to the destruction of trees and
shrubs ; but a parrot or parrakeet in a cage, having little to occupy its mind
beyond its food, cannot be cured of a bad habit of this nature.
In his excellent work on the Parrakeets my friend Mr. Seth-Smith says
of the Blue-Bonnets and their near relatives--" Canary-seed should be the staple
food of these birds in captivity, and to this should be added millet, hemp and
oats, the last two sparingly, and an abundance of green food during the summer
months is essential. The present writer has kept three species for years, and is
strongly opposed to soft food, such as bread and milk, egg and bread, and so on,
as a food for these birds, except when there are young birds to be fed, when stale
bread, soaked in cold water and squeezed nearly dry is undoubtedly most bene-
ficial, and aids the parents very considerably in their task of feeding their
young."
Butter is undoubtedly bad for all kinds of parrots. A. G. BUTLER.
THE KINGFISHER.
SIR, --I don't know if the small amount of experience I have had in keep-
ing Kingfishers in captivity will prove of interest to your readers ; for I am bound
to say that I did not meet with a great amount of success. The first attempt
was when I was at Eton. I procured a young hand-reared one which I kept in
an ordinary Blackbird's cage. I used to feed him by hand on minnows which I
partly caught myself and partly bought from Bembridge (the fishing-tackle man).
I had him about three weeks, when my house-master strongly objected to the
insanitary odour in my room, so I had to find other quarters for my bird. At
that time I kept several terriers, white rats, and other small game at a cottage in
Tangier Lane, Eton, which was out of bounds. It belonged to a man of the
name of Jim Bailey, a stone-mason by trade {when he chose to work), who I
afterwards started in a bird-shop in Eton. He took charge of the Kingfisher,
and the bird lived in the Blackbird's cage in perfect health for nine months and

then suicided himself by poking his head through the bars and hanging himself.
He was fed practically entirely on minnows and got through about twenty a
day. No doubt he would have eaten a hundred, but twenty seemed to do him
very well, probably owing to the sedentary life he led. Occasionally, when
minnows were scarce, he had strips of raw beef cut into the size of a minnow and
dipped in water, The bottom of the cage was covered with saw dust and he had
a flower pot saucer full of water at one end. During the whole of this time he
was fed by hand, and it is to that I believe that I owe the success in keeping him.
Since then I have more than once tried to keep Kingfishers in both cages
and aviary : providing them with a vessel of water with live minnows in it. In
each case the result was the same, viz., the bird killed himself by taking headers
into the water after the fish. Unless the tank for the fish is deep enough this
will always prove the stumbling block to keeping Kingfishers in captivity.
The last one I tried was an exceedingly tame young bird, which Mr.
Galloway, of Caversham, hand-reared for me. This bird I put in one of my
out-door aviaries with one end roofed in. Along the front I placed a zinc tank
about 4ft. long, ISins. wide and 5ins. deep. The bottom of this was covered with
gravel and a number of minnows were kept in it. I arranged a small bough of a
tree about a foot above the tank for the bird to sit on to catch his fish. This he
would not do, but sat on another tree branch about 4ft. above the tank. From
this he would watch the fish for a few moments and then take a violent header.
In the end he broke his beak completely and died.
From my experience, such as it is, I have come to the conclusion that it
is possible to keep a Kingfisher in confinement either in a cage or an aviary, but
in case of a cage the bird would always have to be hand-fed (about 20 to 25
minnows a day). In an aviary a tank would have to be provided, and the correct
depth of the water and the height above it for the branch would have to be dis-
covered, In a tank like this, far more minnows must be provided, and there
would always be the trouble of the bird clearing up the lot in a short space of
time and then having too long a fast afterwards. On the whole, I believe the
cage would behest as requiring less fish, and no chance of the bird killing him-
self by taking headers. At a pinch, a Kingfisher will do for a meal or two on
strips of raw beef, and no doubt would do as&amp;apos; well on any large fresh ivater fish
cut up into small pieces and dipped in water as upon minnows.
All well, this summer I intend to have another attempt at keeping a King-
fisher, and hope to let the readers of the Avicultural Magazine know of my
success or failure.
The old keeper of the Fish-house at the Zoo. has on several occasions tried
to keep Kingfishers, but I believe none lived more than a few months. The last
I saw was in the Waders' Aviary near the Lions' House. There was a com-
paratively small zinc trough fixed to the wirework inside the aviary, about 8ft.
from the ground. At intervals, the keeper used to put a few minnows into the
tin and the bird at once flew across, seized one and flew off to the bough of a tree

at the other end of the enclosure, where he banged it on the head and eat it.
In this case there was no place from which the bird could take a header, as he
could only settle on the tin and snatch the fish. The objection to this to my
mind is the difficulty there would be with a Kingfisher to get him to find this
small tin in a large aviary. In any case the bird must be hand-reared.

KINGFISHERS IN FREEDOM AND CAPTIVITY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99305634375" page_id="32670174"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
Lady William Cecil (Baroness Amherst of Hackney) writes
I have been much interested to read in the January Magazine the correspondence
about Trout and Kingfishers. We had so many of both at Didlington (Norfolk)
in the old days. My father used to annually breed a large quantity of trout for
many years. They were turned out in the decoy ponds, in the lake and in the
river (Wissey). They did very well and grew and increased continually; we used
constantly to catch them up to several pounds. The Kingfishers did not seem
to interfere at all with the Trout, at least not to any appreciable extent. In the
banks of the lake they nested yearly, sometimes in the bank not 200 yards from
the house, and they fished constantly in the lake (where we could watch them
from the windows) either from the branches of the trees overhanging the water,
or whenever they could, from the mast of our little sailing boat, which was
anchored a short distance from the shore.
We had a tame Kingfisher for some time, it had hurt its wing and so was
caught. We kept it in a big Crystal Palace aviary, which it shared with some
Cordon Bleus and various other little " foreigners." We gave it a bank of turf
and a small stump to sit on, for, owing at first to its injured wing, it could not
fly up to sit on the perches; however, it soon recovered and sat on the
perches now and then, though generally preferring the stump. We kept a large
earthenware basin of water in the cage and it was stocked with fish, about six
or eight atja time three or four times a day. The dear little bird soon became
very tame and would perch on the rim of the bowl the moment we put in his
fish. We gave him all sorts of small fry, and I think if he had any preference
it was for small gudgeon. He remained in perfect plumage and did not mope at
all. I am sorry to say some one gave him an extra supply of fish one morning
and he ate thirteen at a sitting and never recovered the fatal feast- I believe
he would have comfortably digested double that number had he been at libertjq
but he had so little exercise in the cage and his food was too easily caught, so
that his greediness was the cause of his death. We never allowed any Kingfishers
to be killed at Didlington, and any places on the banks of the lake or any stream
where there were nests, were always left undisturbed until the nestlings were
ready to fly.

THE NIGHTJAR.
(Gaprimulgus Europeans).
By P. L. M. Galloway.
This curious bird seldom arrives in England until the first
week in May. I have generally noticed it about the second or third
of the month and on a few occasions by the 30th of April. It loves
to bask in the sunshine during daytime, and in its haunt on a
common amongst scrub and furze, I haye seen it on a bare piece
of ground in the sun looking more like a small log of weather-
beaten wood with the bark on, than a bird; and have been able to
quietly walk up to within a few feet of it, when suddenly it darted
up over my head and away over the common. During the fine
warm summer evenings, I have spent several pleasant hours in the
Nightjar's favourite haunt, sitting smoking my pipe and waiting
for the bird to emerge from his hiding place, and as soon as the
dusk came on, out he would come and glide past me silently
backwards and forwards, then alight on a low bough, arrange
himself lengthwise with the bough and at once commence his
jarring notes. The flight of this species is for the most part silent.
The male bird w T ill fly off the bough and glide along without moving
the wings, then suddenly with his tail twisted sideways and clapping
his wings together rather sharply over his back, he will utter a note
several times like Koip, Koip, Koip, and then perhaps alight again
on a branch and carry on his peculiar jarring notes for some little
time. They take their food (which consists of moths large and
small, Cockchafers, Dorbeetles, and other night flying insects) on
the wing. As soon as daylight approaches they hide away until

The Nightjar.
evening, although in the height of the breeding season the male
bird may be seen on a bough jarring away for a time and even
venture to hawk about on the wing. The bill is very small and
the mouth enormous. One might say, without exaggerating, that
when the mouth opens, the head is split in half. The tongue is very
small, heart-shaped, and is situated a long way down the mouth.
The eyes are very large and prominent, being quite as large as the
round black head of an ordinary hat pin used by ladies. Legs, feet
and toes very small. The female is much browner and paler in
colour than the male and without the oval white spots on the
flights and outer tail feathers. The young are generally hatched
early in July, and I have also found them during the early part of
August. The female, if flushed during the nesting season, will
flutter along the ground for many yards, holding the head well up,
often with mouth open and appearing as if one wing and both her
legs were broken. If the observer returns to the spot where he
first flushed her, there on a bare piece of ground, surrounded more
or less by small bushes, he will see two oval eggs, which in colour
look like veined marble, or resemble at first sight two nice shaped
pebbles, or if there are young, he will have the satisfaction of looking
upon two of the ugliest little creatures in bird life he could possibly
find. The young at first have the skin of a dark purplish shade
covered with greyish and straw-coloured hairy down, the head is
flat on top, the eye-balls bulge out of their sockets and the nostrils
greatly protrude. As the young grow they look yery ugly until the
soft downy feathers grow and fill up the cavity around the eyes
and nostrils. As soon as the young begin to feather, they will
run from the spot where they were hatched and may be found
squatting on the ground about a couple of yards away. After a day
or two they will run a few yards to another fresh bit of ground and
so on until they are able to fly. There are six dark stiff bristles
along the edge of the upper mandibles. These appear to act as a
barrier to a struggling moth or other insect when captured. The
Nightjar takes its food into its mouth and swallows it straight away,
but supposing a large moth was captured at the side of the mouth,
these bristles prevent the struggling insect from escaping, the bird
will draw its head near to its breast, and the moment the insect

ceases to struggle the bird will instantly give a jerk and gulp the
insect down, making quite a noise with the mouth.
I reared a Nightjar some years ago, taking it at the age
of four or five days; it lived in perfect condition just over five years,
was of course, being hand-reared, exceedingly tame, and was really
a most interesting pet. The bird was allowed to fly about the room
for a certain time during the evening. He would allow me to handle
him freely without showing any fear. He took very little food*
during the day, and spent most of his daylight in attending to his
toilet and dozing. If I placed him in the sunshine, he would jump
off his log (which served as a perch) and lie on the floor of his
cage, spread his long wings out and bask in the heat. He never
bathed, but would dust himself in sand like a fowl.
THE KINGFISHER AND SNIPE IN
CAPTIVITY.
By Gerald E. Rattigan.
Having read Mr. Barnby Smith's letter on the Kingfisher in
the current issue of the Avicultural Magazine, and noticing shortly
afterwards the request of the Editor for copy, I am prompted to
give my experiences, such as they have been, in the keeping of
these birds, which I hope may be of some interest.
I bought my first Kingfisher and the only one with which I
was at all successful in or about November, 1910. I kept it for the
first three or four w T eeks that it was in my possession in a large
cage specially constructed for it, with a small tank let into it in
which minnows and other small fish could be placed. For the first
few days it was fed solely on minnows, then finding this form of
diet w T as a bit too expensive, " I was living in London at the time,
where the supply of suitable small fish is limited and none too
cheap what there is of it," so I tried desperately hard to get it on to
some form of soft food. Every possible form of insectile mixture
was offered it, as well as egg and bread and all kinds of other things,
and to try and make them attractive I placed in the dishes
* We take it that Mr. Galloway fed his Nightjar on " Life," mealworms,
moths, etc.--ED.

Mr. Gerald E. Rattigan,
containing the various foods, both live minnows, minnows chopped
in half, and minnows chopped up very small and mixed in with the
food; nothing, however, proved of the slightest avail in inducing
it even to try any of the mixtures. The live minnows and the
minnows cut in half were carefully picked out and devoured, but
the minced minnow was not touched.
At length I gave up the attempt in despair. However, I w T as
more successful in another direction, for I succeeded eventually in
getting my bird to partake of mealworms and he finally grew very
partial to these invaluable insects, but curiously enough he would
only eat them if placed with his allowance of fish in the water, and
would take no notice of them if placed in the soft food dish or on
the floor of his cage. After keeping it caged up for the period
mentioned, I turned it out into an aviary.
I first of all intended having a small pond made for it, but
finding this rather too expensive a business, I had perforce to be
content with a large earthenw r are sink as a substitute. This I at
first only half filled with water, fearing the tragedy that eventually
overtook it. To be more explicit, what I feared was that, its wings
being stiff from want of exercise for so long a time, it might after a
plunge into the water be unable to circumvent the slippery sides of
the sink, and so be drowned. Finding, however, that various other
inmates of the aviary, notably a Shama, were beginning to take an
unhealthy, "for my pocket," interest in the fish, and were robbing
the unfortunate Kingfisher of practically all his lawful prey, I, in
order to save him as much as possible from the effects of their
ravages, took to filling up the sink to the brim, and by filling it
almost to overflowing, I thought that if he did, as I feared, chance
to fall in, he could easily get out again. All went well for a day
or two, but one afternoon on entering the aviary to renew the
supply of fish and mealworms, I found the Kingfisher floating quite
dead on the surface of the water.
The water in the tank had been splashed out a bit, no doubt
by the Kingfisher in his efforts to catch the fish, and had fallen to a
depth of about an inch below the rim. All the fish had gone, so I
imagine it was in effecting the capture of the last one that he met
his fate. It is possible, of course, that he may have hit his head

on the bottom of the sink when plunging in after a fish, but this
I think is hardly likely, and it is more probable that his plumage
being saturated by frequent immersions in the water, he was at
length unable to rise out of it, and failing to negotiate the inch or so
of the slippery sides of the sink rising out of the water, he was at
length drowned. I don't know when I have ever regretted the loss
of any bird more ; he had become so tame and was in every way a
most intelligent and engaging creature. My two other subsequent
attempts to keep this species were, I regret to say, failures ; but this
I think was more my fault than my misfortune, at all events in the
second case it was my fault, the first can hardly count as an attempt
at all, for the bird was as good as dead when I received it, and
succumbed a few hours after its arrival. The second bird, however,
arrived in fine condition and very much alive ; too much so perhaps,
for it was as wild as a hawk. Instead of caging it up as I should
have done, and as on the former occasion gradually accustoming it
to a life in captivity, I foolishly allowed it to fly loose in a large
aviary with the natural result that it dashed itself about all over
the aviary and against the wire netting. Thinking that it would
gradually quieten down, I left it to its own devices after supplying
it with a quantity of fish. Although it survived two or three days,
the end was inevitable, as for one thing it hardly ate anything, if
indeed it ate at all, and never ceased, so long as I watched it, from
dashing against its prison bars. It was also probably on account
of this wildness which disturbed the other birds, that it was
unmercifully mobbed by the whole crowd ; the Eed-crested Cardinals
I then had in the aviary as usual leading the attack (by the way,
how anyone, as they frequently do, can affirm that these birds are
quite harmless in a mixed series, passes my understanding). It is
true enough that they will leave severely alone any bird which is
strong and bold enough to stand up to them, but let that bird
be worsted in a fight with one of its fellows or another species
and be chased by the victor, and every Eed-crested Cardinal will
join in the pursuit and continue it till they have run down and
battered the panic-stricken creature to death. Again, introduce a
strange bird into their aviary and they will immediately make a
demonstration against it, and should it display any signs of panic

Mr. Gerald E. Rattigan,
at their manoeuvres, fiercely attack it. Zebra Finches and other
small birds they will relentlessly pursue and endeavour to catch
them in the air. I am certain, in fact, that they are never really
happy unless chasing something, and one can see by their every
movement, by the excited raising of their crests and continual
utterance of their call notes, for all the world like a pack of hounds
in full cry, how keenly they are enjoying their chase. I have
referred above particularly to the Red-crested variety, although in
my experience, the Yellow-billed and Pope Cardinals are bad enough
as regards chasing and injuring small Finches, though the mere
spirit of the chase does not appear to enter into them in quite
the same manner. The Virginian or Red Cardinals I have found
the least dangerous, and with the exception of one old cock who,
after leading a most exemplary existence, suddenly run amok and
did a good deal of mischief, I have never had any trouble with
them, and no bird to my knowledge has ever been injured in any
way by them. The safest Cardinal in a mixed company after
the Virginian, I have found to be the Green. This species always
appears to me to bear much the same relationship to the other
birds in the aviary that a stout and dignified policeman does to
the small boy. They are invariably devoted to their mates and
their young&amp;apos;, and in this respect at all events, compare very favour-
ably with many human parents, and interfere as little as possible
in the affairs of their neighbours, " another quality that is very
much lacking in many humans which they might with advantage
cultivate," unless they themselves or their young are interfered
with, when both parents will attack the aggressor with the utmost
determination and pugnacity. It was, I think, because of their
meddlesome ways, especially during the breeding season, when they
are wont to drive all the other inmates of an aviary about and
generally create a disturbance, without it is true doing any actual
damage to life or limb, that all my Green Cardinals took such a
violent dislike to all members of the Hyphcmtornis species of
Weaver, that it became utterly impossible to keep the two species
together in the same aviary. The whole family of Cardinals would
mob and very soon, if given a chance, literally batter to pieces any
Weaver of this species introduced into their aviary. These

Cardinals simply will not tolerate any disturbance in their division,
and in the event of any unseemly brawls or quarrels, constitute
themselves into a kind of police force, part the combatants and
punish with promptness and severity the bird they deem the
offender. They are in fact without rival as keepers of the peace.
At the same time, I have kept and bred them in an aviary contain-
ing the smallest Finches without having the least cause to regret
my temerity. It must be understood that what I have written
above refers only to staid old birds in their second or third season,
and not to flighty young birds in their first season, who, it must be
confessed, are often prone to do mischief out of pure exuberance
of spirits and the joy of living. These youngsters are for this
reason not altogether dependable or safe companions for small or
defenceless species. I fear I have allowed myself to be carried
very far away from the real subject of these notes. I should like,
however, as I have touched on this subject, to give my experience,
such as it is, of the behaviour of different species in a mixed series,
and to indicate those which I have found dangerous or otherwise.
This I will do hereafter, if our Editor thinks it will be of sufficient
general interest.
In the meantime to return to the subject of the Kingfisher;
from my first experience, I do not think it would be a difficult
matter to keep them in captivity under suitable conditions. Of
course, the method " par excellence " of keeping them, would be
in an aviary with a small stream running through it. This stream
could be blocked at its entrance to and exit from the aviary with
fine gauze, through which the water could pass without letting
out the minnows, etc., with which it would be an easy matter to
stock it. If necessary, the stream could be dammed to form small
pools and a fair-sized bank of sand or loose earth built up on one
or both sides of it, in which it is more than likely the birds would
go to nest. Failing these more or less ideal conditions, the most
suitable plan I should think, would be to construct a fair-sized
cement pool in the aviary with a deep and a shallow end. Before
turning the birds into either description of aviary, it would be
most necessary that they should have been made fairly tame, as
otherwise the venture would be foredoomed to almost certain

disaster. Hand-reared birds would be, of course, the most suitable,
and it might be possible to induce these to partake of some form
of fish meal or insectile mixture. I doubt, however, from my own
experience, whether an adult caught bird, however tame it might
become, would ever take to this diet. I believe I am correct in
stating that partial success has been met with at the Zoological
Gardens, Regent's Park, in the breeding of the closely-allied Sacred
Kingfisher, the birds, according to the information I received from one
of the keepers, went to nest in a log nest box of the design generally
constructed for the use of Parrakeets. I do not think that any
young were actually hatched out, but perhaps Mr. Seth-Smith
would kindly give us the details, which would ceitainly be of great
interest. Should I succeed in obtaining a pair, I mean to have
another try at keeping, and if possible, breeding these birds this
year. I trust this correspondence may prompt other members who
may have kept Kingfishers to give us the benefit of their experiences,
for no more charming a bird could well grace an aviary.
I do not think they require the enormous amount of fish
"per diem" that Mr. Barnby Smith seems to imply. My bird,
at all events, was strictly limited to ten minnows in the morning
and ten again after lunch, with roughly twenty or thirty mealworms
added. If an unlimited supply of fish were given, I think it would
harm rather than benefit the birds, as they are greedy creatures
and would be sure to devour many more than was good for them.
My bird, during the six or seven weeks he was in my possession,
until his sudden death, never looked sick or sorry, so the treatment
I gave him cannot have disagreed with him to any great extent.
The Snipe is yet another bird that appears to be badly
neglected by aviculturists. Why this should be so, I cannot
imagine, as it is a delightful bird for an aviary, and from the
experience of it that I shall describe below, I should say not at
all difficult to keep, even under seemingly most adverse conditions.
I have nevertheless looked in vain to see a representative of the
species even in the waders' aviary at Regent's Park, where the
conditions for keeping them would be pretty nearly ideal, and
where many of what I should imagine must be far more difficult
subjects are kept in beautiful trim.

The subject of these notes was found by one of my dog&amp;apos;s
in a marsh about half-a-mile from this house, on the 20th May,
1914. It was evidently some days old when discovered, for it
fluttered away from the dog and flew a distance of some forty or
fifty yards when it collided with a railway arch and collapsed into
the road, where I picked it up and brought it back home. I placed
it in a large cage, almost a small aviary, 6ft. x 4ft. x 6ft., and
supplied it with a diet of worms and mealworms. These I placed
in a tin pan filled with moss and water. The little thing was very
timid and shy for the first few days, but began to feed within
an hour after it was placed in the cage, and when I saw it from
my window eagerly probing away in the moss and fishing out
the worms I felt that half the battle was won. And so it proved
to be, for I never had any more anxiety concerning its welfare
from then on, till it met with the accident that proved its undoing
some three months later. After it had taken so readily to the
worm (earth) and mealworm diet, I gradually got it on to a good
insectile mixture, "Galloway's," which by the way I can thoroughly
recommend to anyone on the look out for a first-rate food of this
nature, by placing some of the worms in a dish containing the
" soft " food. By this means it was very quickly induced to sample
and form a liking for this artificial diet, and a fortnight or so after
it was caught became so tame that it would take mealworms out
of my fingers. When it had become thoroughly tame, I turned
it into my large aviary, where though it unfortunately lost some
of its tameness, it throve exceedingly and waxed fat and prosperous
looking. For fear that it might injure itself when first turned into
the aviary, I had cut the flight feathers of one wing, but they must
have grown again more rapidly than I expected, for on entering
the aviary one morning, I found the poor little bird with one leg
hanging and looking the picture of misery. I fear it must have
essayed a nocturnal flight and have gone full tilt into the wire
netting, probably getting its claws entangled in it and so have come
to grief. I did all I could for it, but it was of no avail, and from
that time forward it began to grow more and more mopy and
listless, and when it finally died about ten days later, proved on
examination to be nothing more than skin and bone. One rather

curious thing it used to do when supplied with its dish of " soft "
food, was to take a portion of it in its bill and rush off with it to
the water vessels, where it would moisten the food in the water
before swallowing it. It would then carry water back in its bill
and empty it into the " soft " food dish. This performance it
would repeat several times till it had made the food into a very
sloppy mess, when it would proceed to devour it with much gusto.
I eventually was forced to supply it with a separate dish of "soft"
food, as by these manoeuvres it rendered the main supply quite
unfit for my Landrails and other " soft " food eaters. It struck
me, however, that the bird showed wonderful intelligence in the
manner it obviously thought matters out, and having decided that
the food was not prepared to its liking, gave a pleasing display of
sound reasoning power in effecting a remedy. Another proof to
my mind that birds are by no means so much guided by blind
unreasoning instinct as some good people fondly imagine.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I think it is the
greatest pity that two such charming species as the foregoing
appear to have been so sadly neglected by aviculturists. In the
case of the Kingfisher there is admittedly some excuse for this
neglect, for unless one is conveniently near a river or lake where
an unlimited supply of minnows or similar small fish can be
obtained, it is, as I have good reason to know, a pretty expensive
business to provide for its wants. In the case of the Snipe,
however, this does not apply, and it requires no special conditions,
as far as my experience goes, to keep it in perfect health. Even
in my large aviary it had to be content with a grass run, and all
through a pretty dry summer, all it was provided with in the shape
of its natural surroundings, was a fair-sized earthenware dish filled
with moss and water, and yet it throve well. It used to get through
a surprising amount of earthworms, and these, together with about
twenty mealworms and the " soft " food mentioned, was all that
I supplied it with in the way of food.
Whilst living in London, I kept a Sandpiper in a similar
manner, which lived in my aviaries there for over two years, and
was still in perfect health when it was set upon and killed by a
cock Golden Pheasant. This was an adult caught bird which I

purchased from Mr. Frost, who had just received it at the time
from one of his catchers. It was so wild when I received it that
I had to clip the flights of one wing in order to prevent it dashing
itself to bits against the sides of the aviary. However, it soon
settled down and became fairly tame in a few weeks, and eventually
so far overcame its natural shyness that it would take mealworms,
etc., from my fingers with the greatest boldness. All of which
goes to prove that some species, at all events, of the smaller waders,
are by no means difficult to keep in captivity, and will thrive well
even under conditions differing widely from those obtaining in
their natural state.
THE KINGFISHER.
By P. F. M. Galloway.
Having read the interesting notes on the Kingfisher by our
Editor and others in the Avicultural Magazine, and also the letter
from Mr. C. Barnby Smith, asking for information relating to keep-
ing the Kingfisher in captivity, I should like to say I have kept this
handsome bird in perfect health.
I have kept the adult Kingfisher for two years, and no doubt
should have been able to keep it much longer, but for the fact that
during a very severe spell of frost whilst I was away from home it
died. I may say I left it in charge of a servant who, seeing that
there were several small fish in its large water tin, thought things
were all right, but it did not occur to her that the poor bird could
not get at the fish, owing to the water tin being frozen over. My
advice is never leave birds in charge of anyone, unless it is someone
who takes the same amount of interest in them as you do yourself.
The Kingfisher is a very interesting bird to keep, but live fish
it must have. I have also hand-reared it and kept it, but it is an
exceedingly dirty bird in a cage, owing to the nature of its food;
and if kept in a cage, the cage should be three feet long, fourteen
inches deep and sixteen to eighteen inches high. At one end a
vessel made of zinc, 2i inches deep, 3i inches wide, to hold live
fish, should be made to slide into the cage and should be the width
of the cage from back to front. Level with the top of this vessel a

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
perch should be placed and one near the other end of the cage.
The bird will fly from the farthest perch and settle on the perch by
the tank, thrust its head into the water and fetch out a fish, give it
two or three sharp knocks on the peich to wake it up and bolt it
headfirst; but supposing there was no perch level with the edge of
the tank, the bird would fly straight into the tank and throw the
water all over the place. I will just show a rough sketch of the
cage I have mentioned.
The Kingfisher will thrive if fed upon minnows, small bleak
or small roach, but minnows seem to be one of its favourite foods.
When small live fish could not be obtained for a time, I found mine
would eat whitebait ; I used to get these from the fishmonger.
Those that are burst and soft should be rejected and only the firmest
fish used. I also used to try him with small narrow cut pieces of
raw beef; he would eat these when hungry, but never seemed so fit
and well as when fed upon live fish. If a Kingfisher was fed, say
for a week, on dead fish or raw meat, he would begin to look soft
and out of condition, but just give him a few minnows and they act
like magic on him, in a very short space of time you would pull
him round and he would he as bright and sleek as possible again.
It is a curious thing, that when this bird is out of health and

he jumps into his water vessel, he never seems to get properly dry.
but when fit and well he could dive into a bucket of water and out
again on the edge of the pail and look as if he had never been under
water. Mine was very tame and I used to put a few minnows in a
bucket occasionally and carry him on my finger and place him on
the edge of the bucket, he would sit bobbing his head up and down
for a time, and when he had a chance of getting a fish, he would
shoot in under and out again like a flash and give himself a shake
and was quite dry ; sometimes he brought our a fish and sometimes
missed it. It is of course natural for these birds to dive, and I am
certain a tame Kingfisher requires this exercise.
I consider a Kingfisher is not a difficult bird to keep in health,
so long as live fish can be got for it, but there are times, for instance
when the river is in flood, when fish cannot be found; at other
times brooks in winter may become frozen over, and in winter when
the river is muddy it is almost impossible to find small fish. Then,
again, in the close season the fish cannot be had, but there is a way
of overcoming this difficulty of food supply, and this is the way I
should advise anyone to proceed who wishes to keep a Kingfisher in
perfect trim in captivity.
First of all, the ideal place for him would be to net over a small
pond, but everyone is not blessed with a small pond on his premises.
However, the next best thing is to make a pond 18 inches deep; it
need not be wide, but it should be as long as the purse will admit,
so that the bird can get a straight flight, and of course wired over.
At one end a bank could be formed of earth and sand beaten firm,
in this bank a hole should be scooped out about two feet through ;
outside the hole a dead bough could be fixed, where the bird could
perch on before entering the hole, in which place it would be sure
to roost. On the top of the bank an inch of concrete could be
placed, and over this a thin coating of cement; this would allow
the heavy rains to run off and keep the bank fairly dry, a few turfs
could be put on top and hide the cement. A few feet from the
bank some large branches could be fixed so as to hang over the
artificial brook, and another set of branches arranged the same way
the other end ; better and more natural still would be to place the
heads of small dead pollards in place of the boughs, but no other

A French Member of the Society,
perching places should be provided, the idea being to allow the bird
to fly from one pollard to the other ; minnows and other small fish
could be placed in the water.
A small round pond could be made, near a sloping piece of
ground if possible, so that the surface water would run into it after
a shower, a narrow gutter being dug out for the purpose. In this
small pond fish could be stored, to be used at times when they could
not be obtained, as previously mentioned. If it was desired, a few
rushes could be placed here and there on the edges of this artificial
brook, which would give a finishing touch and a pretty effect to the
whole. In such an aviary a Kingfisher would undoubtedly thrive,
and it is just possible that a pair might be induced to breed there.
A cage such as I have described would be kept to place the
Kingfisher in during severe frosty weather, because the brook would
freeze over, and when the weather became milder the bird could be
put out into the brook aviary again.

Soon after their arrival home, the Hummers were divided up
amongst the cages and aviaries (indoors) described in my last article.
I wished to learn by study which of the two modes of confinement
better met their wants. Some three or four were therefore let out
in several large cages, each lighted by a powerful electric lamp,
which, on dark days, was kept burning from early morning to about
seven p.m. Fires and a radiator kept the temperature up to 20*
centrigrade ( i.e . 68* Fahrenheit) : and under these conditions most
of the birds soon settled down to their new life and prospered. A
fresh tail adorned the tiny Bellona exilis, and I noted with satisfac-
tion that several of the Garnet-throated Humming Birds, whose
beaks had been broken at the tip, were fast growing a new upper
mandible. Next to the lamented Bellona, these latter were, and

are still, by far the most lively. Eulampis holosericeus appears to
be, in captivity at least, rather a sluggish creature ; too fond, when
not actually engaged in fighting, of sitting for hours on the same
favourite twig. But one forgot the sea-voyage, with all its miseries,
when watching the Garnets and their marvellous flight, their evolu-
tions in space, bacJcivards, forwards, sideways, all occupied by that
loud whirring noise which reminds me always of a miniature aero-
plane. At first their activity seemed confined to the early morning
hours or late afternoons, when they were incessantly on the wing,
circling round and round or hovering perfectly still in mid-air,
suspended, as it were, by some invisible thread; but the periods of
intensified energy gradually lengthened out, and now, except for a
short spell towards noon, they all but live in the air. No doubt in
their own land the tremendous mid-day heat enforces a protracted
rest, and the natural instinct to seek repose until the hours of
twilight needed those many months to adapt themselves to modified
conditions.
To encourage hovering, I soon discarded all tin feeders for
open glass ones. All very healthy Humming Birds prefer to take
their food in this manner, buzzing over the little pot that contains

A French Member of the Society,
it, as in nature they do over flowers. Their diet is practically that
of my Sunbirds: the usual mixture of Mellins' Food, honey and
condensed milk, made perhaps a trifle weaker ; then a variety of
fruit, such as sweet grapes and oranges and very soft, ripe pears.
Flowers I have not found yet to really suit their taste, though many
have been tried. They scorned Madonna Lilies, Tiger Lilies and
Tuberoses, after just probing the blossoms a few times ; Honeysuckle
was more appreciated, as well as some other flowers of the tubular
type, provided they were not white : red seems to be a favourite shade
and to at once arrest their attention. For many months it was
impossible to get a single one of the Hummers to eat insects. I
tried the most tempting green fly, and those tiny Coleoptera that
abound in the spring amongst shrubs and in meadow&amp;apos;s, without the
slightest success. It was, I think, last September, the windows
being wide open in the bird-room on a sunny day. that I observed
some of the Garnets in the aviary snapping at something in the
air: and the act was repeated many times in a minute. Snap,
snap, went the beak, as the bird hummed, whirred, twisted, and
turned about in space, performing gnat-like, a veritable dance in
the air, and each time the shining garnet-throat glistened and moved
as for the operation of swallowing. So minute was the prey that
it took me a long time to actually catch and study it : tiny insects
called, I believe, September flies. I have not once seen my
Hummers take insects in any other way except on the wing; and
although all in my aviary would crowd round me, buzzing about
my head and body like a swarm of bees, and feeding from the
hand that held the syrup-pot, none ever consented to touch live
prey if this were offered them, and not actually caught by them-
selves in the manner described. On this point my experience differs
from Mr. Ezra's. The Eulampis jugularis he had from me, does
not so far care for insects; but he has another species--a charming
little bird obtained from Cuba --Sporadinus ricordi, whose portrait
appeared in the February magazine as the coloured frontispiece,
and this bird from the very first showed himself most eager for
green fly, which he picks up anyhow and anywhere, from the
plant, the bars or floor of his cage, or in the air, indifferently.
However individuals and species may display their peculiarities,

my Humming Birds and how I obtained them. 153
that Hummers in nature are very largely insectivorous, while the
nectar extracted from flowers acts either as a simple digestive, or as
necessary complement to the more solid food, is a fact which, both
from the general knowledge of those who studied them in the wild,
and from my own much more restricted experience, remains no
more open to doubt than is their amazing ability to fly in every
conceivable direction or attitude, be it sideways or backwards, with
as much ease and grace as they show when hovering, with tremu-
lous wings, over an object they wish to probe.
Early last July the Hummers began to drop feathers and
moult. They sat clumsily and laboriously engaged in the act of
scratching, for a Hummer cannot rest on one leg, and it takes him
all his time to keep his balance if he must use one foot for other
purposes but that of clutching his support. The moult, as I ex-
pected, proved rather slow, only now can I fairly say, it is over
at last (November); and the rich reflections of the birds' plumage
showing up more brilliantly than ever, as well as their greater
vivacity and slimmer, tighter shape, are sufficient signs that they
suffered no ill-effects from that trying time. Only the tiny Bellona
exilis succumbed after heroic efforts : the little fellow wanted ever
so much to live the short spell allotted him by nature, and I cannot
yet bear to think of his death.
It was just after the moult that the Hummers declared war
on each other, and, in fact, on every bird in the room, thus proving
that animal life is not, after all, so very unlike our own, which after
evolving from its early stages, now seems inclined to revert to
conditions apparently held as ideal by certain rulers and nations of
the present day. Whether an increase of vitality, attributable to a
successful dropping of the old garb and assuming of the new plumage
brought out the old fighting instinct amongst the Humming Birds,
which so far had only appeared at intervals, and so to speak lay
dormant; or whether the season coincided with their breeding-time,
it is not for me to decide, as I am wholly ignorant of their habits in
the wild state ; but it is quite certain that about the middle of
October it became impossible to continue keeping the Hummers
together or with any other birds whatever. All day they were " at
it " ! all day the furious " skrip, skrip," which seems their only call,

A French Member of the Society,
sounded through the room as an incessant war cry. Each Hummer
wanted the whole of his own tree or branch, all the feeders, or
rather, the whole of the two large aviaries, entirely to himself.
Two of my little green Hummers I foolishly failed to catch and
rescue in good time, and, although they had been the most pugna-
cious, they speedily died from worry, consequent upon the unnatural
strain of a life wholly devoted to warfare. Soon the small Sunbirds
sharing the aviary with the Hummers began to look less cheerful.
Ethopyga nepalensis had to snatch hasty and miserable meals at
moments when the foe's watch was slightly relaxed; (Ethopyga
saturata stopped his pretty warbles. Then I saw something must
be done and without delay. In one single afternoon my two aviaries
were torn down from walls they had adorned for over a year: an
invasion of tables, stands, tripods, cages of all sizes filled the room,
each single bird was captured and given a separate house all to
himself, and peace at last reigned supreme.
It is difficult to describe a Hummer's fighting methods. He
does not use his beak for such a purpose, nearly to the same extent
as other birds, on account of its extreme fragility. His great plan
is to knock down the enemy by violent and repeated assaults, darting
at him again and again with the speed and force of a small catapult;
indeed such is the impetus that the blow would be enough to stun
if not to kill a bird much bigger than himself. Screaming, shaking
their heads and bodies, with tails spread out in the shape of a fan,
all are symptoms of rage and signals of imminent fighting. Match-
ing is never considered: a Garnet-throated Humming Bird,--a
creature about equal in size to the common Wren--thinks nothing
at all of going for a Double-collared Sunbird, nor is the latter very
likely to " stand up " to him. The fury of the attack, also the loud
hizz of the wonderful wings, which these birds can and do intensify
at will, generally succeed in cowing most occupants of the place,
and even now this impish rage has not abated. Two of my strongest
Garnets, who inhabit twin cages in close vicinity on the same shelf,
spend their time in swearing and shaking at one another behind the
bars, whirring and buzzing about with that peculiar flip-flap of
the wing, which in their world is paramount to a challenge in
ours.

,my Humming Birds and how I obtained them. 155
To wind up,--now that an experience of nearly nine months
with Humming Birds has at last proved them to be capable of
thriving in Europe--just a few hints to avieulturists who may, I hope,
feel tempted to obtain these charming little creatures of Tropical
lands. People have asked me if there is a secret by means of which
they can be persuaded to live in our bleak country. Indeed I know
of no such thing, and, although we succeeded with a certain syrup
and along certain lines in acclimatising some Humming Birds, it is
no reason why equal or even greater success should not be achieved
by different methods. But if the roads leading to the desired goal
may be many, some are bound to spell failure. The following are a
few hints: Don't crowd the birds together on the journey; above all
don't let them become messed up with the fluid. Upon arrival at
destination, beware of aviaries. No matter how large these may
be, the Hummers will sooner or later set about making life intoler-
able for themselves and other inmates. Besides this, it is all but
impossible in an aviary, while fairly easy in a cage, to prevent the
Hummers from clinging to the wires, especially at bed-time; the
result being a sad wreck of the lovely tail-feathers. Don't invest
in enormous cages, the birds don't require them, so long as each is
kept strictly alone From his own particular mode of flight a
Humming Bird will take and enjoy almost as much exercise in a
restricted space as in a huge cage. A contrivance two feet long, two
feet high, one foot and a half broad would comfortably accommodate
any middle-sized Hummer. Let your birds of course have as much
sun as possible, and be sure to spray them daily with tepid water,
unless you provide them each with a small green plant, which, when
wetted, they will use as a bath. Don't furnish the cages with twiggy
branches, or the Hummers while buzzing in and out of them will
fray the tips of their long wings. A few, a very few, natural perches
of varying thickness are far more preferable. These need always to
be thin, out of all proportion to the dimension of the occupant; for
in the Humming Birds, after centuries of a life spent in the air, the
legs and feet have become reduced to such minute size, weakened
or atrophied, as it were, by lack of use (as in the Swifts) that they
can actually not turn themselves about on a twig, or move along it,
without the help of their wings. Don't let the temperature drop

below 17* centrigrade or pneumonia may follow. Damp heat is
the best. Don&amp;apos;t wait for a bird to hide his head under the wing
before you make up your mind he is ill and needs nursing. You
might well wait for ever. A Hummer cannot indulge in that attitude
be it to seek sleep or prepare for death..
The following is a list of the various species of Sunbirds and
Humming Birds now occupying my bird-room. Owing to lack of
space, all hens have long ago been discarded as undesirables, as
well as some Sugar-birds and Zosterops.

{Continued from page 128).
In 1881, I received 20 pairs of Impeyan Pheasants, 7 pairs
of Tragopans ( Satyra ), 18 Polyplectron chinquis, 9 Euplocamus
erythrophthalmus, 7 Argus and 2 hen Elliot's Pheasants. During
the snowy season the number of the birds captured was very meagre,
but on the other hand the voyage was very successful, for not one
of the Impeyan Pheasants and Tragopans succumbed.
In 1882, I left Calcutta with 43 pairs of Impeyan Pheasants,
18 Tragopans (Satyra), one male Elliot Pheasant, six Vieillots'
Euplocamus, four E. ignitus, three male Polyplectron bicalcaratum,
one Polyplectron chinquis, three pairs of Euplocamus pyronotus. On
the voyage I only lost four Impeyans, four Tragopans and the one
Polyplectron chinquis (Peacock Pheasant). I sent my man into the
Naga mountains, and he arrived in England two months after I did,
with two males and 3 females of Blyth's Tragopan ; later a fourth
female arrived, which had been left ill at Calcutta. He also brought
one pair of Cabot's Tragopan, of which only the male survived, and
is at this moment (1882) in the London Zoological Gardens; by
this same catcher I also received 13 pairs of Polyplectron chinquis,
and one male and two female Argus Pheasants. As one can see
from what I have already written, after the opening of the Suez
Canal my importations were more successful. I need hardly say
that we had absolutely given up the route via the Cape of Good
Hope, which had ended in such poor results. All the birds I
imported into Europe were sold, but at varying prices. For a large
number of the Impeyan Pheasants (Monauls) I accepted #100 a pair,
but for some of the species I obtained #130 a couple. The Trago-
pans often fetched more than #100 a pair.
Now (ie. 1882) it is very difficult to procure Impeyans and
Tragopans in India, since the Government has forbidden their being
captured or shot for a period of five years.
The capture of the birds is by no means an easy task, and
furthermore it is difficult to bring them to Calcutta.

Mr. William Jamrach's
In fact, the birds, when captured, had to be carried on men's
backs in baskets for at least nineteen days. (To-day--1882--the
railroad has been extended further). The high prices that I obtained
for the living birds might give the idea that I made a large profit
during the nineteen years that I was importing them from India.
As a matter of fact I pocketed nothing. On the contrary, I estimate
that the importation of the Monauls and Tragopans left me with a
loss of #3,000. This heavy loss however was happily covered by
the profit accruing from other business matters in connection with
trading in animals.
Without referring to the larger Mammals which I introduced,
it is perhaps not out of the way if I mention that in 1871, out of
85 Viellot's Pheasant sent off, I received 35. Some of these were
sold for #50 the pair, and others at #75, whilst in a preceding im-
portation, the Zoological Gardens of Antwerp paid me up to #200
for two pairs. In addition to the Monauls and Tragopans which I
have already mentioned, I have imported during the last seventeen
years a great number of birds, the list of which I give further on.
I must mention that Blyth's, Hastings', and Cabot's Trago-
pans were, through my efforts, imported for the first time into
Europe. It was I also who imported a male Sclater's Monaul for
the Zoological Society of London. In 1879 I received the first pair
of Elliot's Pheasant, which I sold for more than #120 to M.
Rodocanachi, who has a large pheasantry, and is one of the mem-
bers of the Societe d'Acclimatation of Paris.
For five years I have zealously striven to import Elliot's
Pheasants, and in order to succeed, I had to overcome difficulties
which seemed insurmountable, and to lay out more than #400. I
hope, however, to regain this outlay later on, thanks to my numerous
clients.
I can assure you, dear Sir, that for these incessant voyages
to India, made entirely for collecting valuable birds and animals, it
is not sufficient to dwell only upon the hope of realizing a pecuniary
profit, but one must above all have a real love for these animals,
which you know I most truly possess.
I am, dear Sir, yours, etc.,
William Jamrach.

Dr. Graham Renshaw,
Writing in The Field, a fancier recorded the following :--
" Soon after the arrival of this species ( Gallophasis elliotii) in
England, I purchased a pair, and another pair on the continent. I
found them very hardy, and decidedly good breeders, but I was not
prepared for the increasing number of eggs they now yearly lay, at
first they laid but few. In 1888, out of those I bred I kept one hen,
mating her with a cock also bred in this country; last year, that is
before she was one year old, she commenced laying ; the first setting,
consisting of nine eggs, produced nine birds; the second of twelve
eggs was not as good, total twenty-one. This year she laid about
the middle of March as usual, and the first nine eggs produced eight
birds, and one dead in the shell; the second twelve eggs produced
only two, the rest were bad. I attribute it partly to the hen ; and
the third sitting has produced eight out of eight eggs, good strong
birds, so she has laid twenty-nine eggs this year. This speaks well
for this beautiful bird, and our best thanks are due to Mr. W.
Jamrach, who first imported them."-- The Field, June, 1890.

By Graham Renshaw M.D., F.R.S.E.
The great zoological collections of the Continent, though
resembling our own in many features, often contain special exhibits
of surpassing interest. The following species have come under the
notice of the writer during the past fourteen years. A number of
them have been exhibited in the Regent's Park collection, others do
not seem to have appeared there, at any rate recently.
1. Paradisect minor (Lesser Bird of Paradise). Apparently
the only Paradise Bird which occurs at all in collections abroad, and
even then the individuals are few and far between. One which the
writer saw at Amsterdam in 1900 was figured in the Avicultural
Magazine for March, 1914 : this or a second example being men-
tioned in the letterpress accompanying the illustration. Some years
ago there was a very good specimen in the Hamburg Zoological
Garden, and another at Berlin. The writer saw a Paradise Bird,

probably referable to this species, in a small dealer's shop in Liver-
pool about twelve years ago; another which was brought over with
it died on the voyage. The display of the Lesser Bird of Paradise
is very beautiful, the trailing flank plumes being raised high by the
bird, and a quivering movement imparted to them, much in the same
way as the peacock shakes its train when expanded, thus giving the
impression of a shower of eyes !
2 &amp; 3. Lamprotornis nitens and L. aurata (Glossy Starlings).
A fine collection of these in the old Bird House at Amsterdam in-
cluded one with several white feathers on the breast--a partial albino.
4. Prosthemadera novce-zealandice (Parson Bird). This species
is exceedingly rare in captivity, and in many years' experience of
Zoological Gardens the writer has only seen one. This specimen--
a fine healthy bird--was living at Amsterdam in May, 1899, being
kept in a spacious outdoor flight well provided with growing shrubs.
The full and beautifully varied song for which the Parson Bird is
famous was not uttered during the writer's visit, but the bird
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955284" page_id="32670211"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
emitted a few musical notes, followed by a harsh clanking sound.
5. Schizorhis concolor (Gape Lourie). One of these dull-
coloured Touracos was living in the Antwerp collection in June,
1913. Its sombre plumage and sluggish demeanour rendered it an
uninteresting exhibit, though if it had been kept in a roomy outdoor
aviary it would probably have become active and noisy. To the
writer it recalled some overgrown, over-sedate Mouse-bird ( Colius ),
though Mouse-birds are only distantly related to Touracos.
6. Prionotelus (Cuban Trogon). The Berlin Zoological Garden
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.727893" page_id="32670211"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
possessed one specimen in June, 1909. In spite of its beauty this
species is sluggish and uninteresting, to be prized only for its rarity ;
a stuffed Trogon is almost as attractive as a live one.

7. Prionites ruficapillus { Motmot). One specimen--also beau-
tiful, yet sluggish--was shown in the pretty little Bird House of the
Hamburg Zoo in June, 1909.
8. Deroptyus accipitrinus (Hawk-billed Parrot). One at
Amsterdam in 1899.
9. Pceoceplialus gulielmi (Jardine's Parrot). One at Amster-
dam in 1902.

Dr. GKAHAM RENSHAW,
exhibited at Amsterdam in 1899. The writer does not remember
having seen any other specimens.
11. Syrnium torquatum (Collared or Spectacle Owl). One
at Amsterdam in 1902. This is one of the very quaintest of the
owls, with its white head and face banded with black as if wearing
a burglar's mask. The writer once had one of these " Spectacle
Owls " in his possession and found it an amusing pet. As the
bird approaches maturity the white head becomes chocolate-coloured.
12. Ardect goliath (Goliath Heron.) This splendid bird was
included in the rich series of herons and storks shown by the
Amsterdam Zoological Society in 1899. Its reddish head and
crest, blue-grey neck and long loose plumes render it one of the
handsomest of its tribe.
13. Canchroma cochlearia (Boat BillJ. This quaint, modified
Night Heron remains sluggish and silent during daylight. Several
specimens seen by the writer all stood stock still as if stuffed, more
like images than living birds. Of two seen at Amsterdam in 1899,
one bird had the feathers at the base of the bill lemon-yellow, while
m the other they were white.
14. Bernicla sandvicensis (Sandwich Island Goose). The
writer was pleased to note an example of this all but extinct
bird amongst the swarming waterfowl in the Cologne Zoological
Garden (June 23, 1909.) It was in fine condition and the plumage
sleek and glossy. Another individual is figured in Heck's " Living
Pictures of the Animal World," published in 1899 and illustrating
the collection at Berlin. These are perhaps the last examples that
will be seen alive in Europe, and in their solitary survival are but
one remove from museum specimens. The Berlin bird was the only
one that had been imported for ten years !
15. Palamedea cornuta (&quot;Horned Screamer). Very rare in
collections. There was a fine healthy example at Hamburg in
June, 1909.
16. Myristicivora bicolor (Nutmeg Pigeon). A beautiful speci-
men was living at Amsterdam in 1902, its snowy plumage tinged on

17. Megacephalum maleo (Celebean maleo). The writer has
only seen one of these very rare birds, which was living at Am-
sterdam in 1900. The crown of the head is not covered with a
large black casque," as stated in books, for in the living bird this
helmet is bright blue. About the size of a small turkey, the maleo
is dark brown above and beautiful salmon pink below : it is handsome
and striking in appearance, and its absence from our aviaries is
much to be regretted.
18. Eurypyga helias (Sun Bittern). These pretty creatures
are expert fly-catchers, the long neck shooting out suddenly and the
fly being caught in the forceps-like beak. When standing these
birds sway slowly but continually from side to side, and this may in
the wild state be protective, the mottled plumage simulating sedges
swayed by the breeze. The Sun Bittern also has a curious habit of
rubbing its bill against the ground, as if sharpening it. Towards
evening these birds utter pleasing and oft-repeated whistles. A
fine pair noticed by the writer had lived some eight years in the
Jardin d'Acclimatation at Paris.
19. Gasuarius westermanni (Westerman's Cassowary). This
fine species is named after Dr. G. F. Westerman, the founder of
the Amsterdam Zoological Society. The writer saw an example
living at Antwerp in 1900.
20. Apteryx mantelli (Mantell's Apteryx). Several of these
rare birds used to be exhibited in the Continental Zoos: at Amsterdam
in 1899 they had both A. mantelli and A. oiveni. These birds are
exceedingly apathetic when roused in the daytime : if turned out of
bed they stand stupidly still, and after a few seconds run heavily
jorwards and dive under their straw.
The difficult problem of outdoor labelling seems to have been
solved at Amsterdam, the labels being inserted in glazed frames
which are then sealed up, and protected from the rain by a projecting
roof. One of these label stands is seen in the accompanying illustra-
tion, the bird perched upon it being a Temminck s Pied Hornbill.

REVIEW.
"A LIST OF BRITISH BIRDS."
The Committee of the British Ornithologists' Union has, with
great pains and careful labour, compiled a fresh and most helpful
list of British Birds, the number of which is recognised as 475 in
all, of which 188 are regular breeding birds and 286 are non-breeding,
and one is extinct, viz., the Great Auk.
The List is sub-divided into Residents (141).
Summer Visitors (47) and Winter Visitors (46).
Birds of Passage, i.e., those which are only found during the
spring and autumn migration periods (30), and Occasional Visitors,
i.e., birds which have occurred on more than twenty occasions (61).
We are glad to find much assistance and lucidity in the
nomenclature, it having been the object of the Committee to use
the oldest name for each genus and species, commencing from 1758,
so that some of the more modern titles have been discarded.
Trinomials (detestable things ! ) have been thrown aside as much
as possible, although one wishes ornithologists could manage to
style the British Bullfinch, Pyrrhula pileata, instead of Pyrrhula
pxyrrhula pileata ; but that is one step better than Pyrrhula pyrrhula
pyrrhula ! The Song Thrush, too, is dubbed Turdus musicus, instead
of Turdus musicus musicus, which latter sounds as if it was applied
to a Thrush who was a sort of Caruso !
What, amongst other things, especially commends itself in
this list, is the derivation of the names from the Latin and Greek ;
for instance, to many members of the Avicultural Society, individuals
who have perhaps left their schoolroom and school days some way
behind, and who might possibly be puzzled as to Coccothraustes
(the generic name for the Hawfinches), we find that that jaw-
breaking title=the kernel-breaker: from Kokkos and Thrauo (to
put it in English lettering). And these derivations make quite an
interesting study, so much so that in the future one fully expects
members of the Society will no longer write in articles that the
Pine-Grosbeak " (for instance) has successfully reared young in
captivity, but rather, " It may interest members to know that my
pair of Pinicola enucleator " has successfully done so ; since after

studying this list of British Birds, and having learnt that Pinicola
is derived from Pinus=a pine-tree, and colere=to inhabit, and
furthermore that enucleater conveys to one's mind a bird who takes
out (e or ex) the kernel (nucleus), it will be just as easy to write of
Pinicola enucleator as of Pine-Grosbeak; and this mode may possibly
also increase our roll of members, for certain ornithologists who sit
in Museums and who would never condescend to speak of Pine-
Grosbeaks or Thrushes, and give tongue to other such vulgar
parlance, would no doubt say, " Ho ho, this Magazine is worth
looking at, these people seem to know what they're writing about,&quot;
only let us be certain of our ground, not confusing terms and titles
as a lady did, who, on walking round the garden of a friend, a real
horticulturist, and hoping to please him, remarked on the beauty
of his Angina pectoris --meaning Anchusa.
Well! there it is, this list, helping us very considerably to
interpret what until now, may have been as an unknown tongue
to many. And there are other advantages in it which lack of space
prevents us from enlarging upon. H. D. A.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
SIR,--Although Kingfishers will take little trout--and at trout-breeding
places the fry have to be protected by wire netting--possibly they like better
other kinds of fish. Many years ago (at Hever in Kent) they carried off all my
goldfish, even some of the size one generally sees in glasssbowls, though these
must have proved very hard to get down. I remember they used to hit them
about a good deal before they tried to swallow them. But why I think they
may prefer coarse fish is this. We have in the garden at home (Hampshire) a
line of pools connected by a stream. One of these pools held only three trout (it
held four, until one, a whopper, was taken by an otter who had his kennel in a
reed bed below) but was full of sticklebacks and minnows. The Kingfishers used to
come there then. There was a balcony opposite the pool and we could sit and
watch the birds fishing there in the pool below. A favourite perch was a twig of
pink thorn that hangs over the water, and another the branch of a rowan.
Sometimes one of the Kingfishers would sit on the ground by the edge of the
water and fish from there. I have never elsewhere seen one doing this. A Dab-
chick was also constantly there and was absurdly tame.
Well, this pool leaked--the water got away through the greensand rock--
and in order to get the full quantity of water over the fall we had to run the
pool empty and work at the leak. This proved to be a longish job, and for many

days, under a fierce sun. the pool lay dry--all but a muddy runnel--and every
fish was lost. One trout of lbs. threw himself on to the mud, and by the time
I got him (to be accurate, her) into a bucket ,was beyond all help, while two,
although we moved them successfully into a tiny pool above, were not to be seen
the next day, being probably taken by the otter that then was working the
stream (judging by his " seal " or footprints, this otter used to execute a moon-
light hornpipe on the mud of the emptied pool). Every minnow or stickleback
that had not escaped down the sluice was dried up by the sun or choked in the
thick water. The Kingfishers have not been there since (nor for that matter
the Dabchick, though he does not properly come into the tale).
Some two hundred yards above this is another and a very much larger pool
full of sizeable trout. It is connected with its spring by a tiny streamlet up
which the trout run to spawn. They will very soon be there now (February),
and presently this little thread of shallow water will harbour shoals of trout-fry.
But though a Kingfisher may be seen going over it like an arrow, never in my
observation will it stay to fish. So I have come to think that the Kingfishers
like coarse fish best, and I should like to stock that garden pool with sticklebacks
and minnows. But I do not know how to do it.

"DO FIELD VOLES IF GIVEN TO BIRDS AS FOOD
CAUSE A WASTING DISEASE?"
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99279480952381" page_id="32670220"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
SIR,--I have often thought of asking a question in the Avicultural
Magazine that seemed a stupid one, but may not be so very stupid after all.
The question is " Do field voles if given to birds as food cause a wasting disease?"
In this part of the country there is a prevalent idea that they do cause a
wasting disease, and that cats that take to eating them soon get thin and die.
I cannot get my aviary man to give voles to any birds, though he will give as
many house mice as he can catch. If I point out that the Cranes catch and
eat numbers of voles I am met by the reply, " Yes, but a Crane is not a Greater
Bird of Paradise." I asked one day what was wrong with a fat, healthy vole.
The reply was " Weel, there will be a something in the head o't, do ye no think
sae yer s'el? " Now, this reply as to there being something in the head of the
vole made me think there might be something in the argument that field voles
cause a wasting disease.
It may be that these animals are often the host of tape or other intestinal
worms, which, of course, would account for birds or cats wasting away if they
became infested. Perhaps some scientific member of the Avicultural Society will
reply to this suggestion and say whether field voles are safe food or not. It is
curious that on two occasions, when I have killed voles and given them to birds
the birds have died ; just a lump of bones and feathers two or three weeks after.
One bird was an Occipital Blue Pie, the other an Apoda (Paradise Bird).

THE RED-HEADED BULLFINCH.
Pyrrhula erytlirocepliala.

imported alive into Europe, when Mr. David Ezra sent over a few
pairs to his brother Mr. A. Ezra from India, a male and female
being most kindly given to me.
Most unfortunately, after keeping them in splendid condition
all last summer and through the winter, I lost the hen bird in a tragic
manner. Bather stupidly I had in my bird room a Pigmy Owl
from Yucatan, scarcely larger than the bullfinches, whose cage hung
in a corner on a wall, the bars being anything but wide apart, and
there the little imp of a bird had been for months ; glaring, it is true,
at the other occupants of the room, but never being able to harm
them, or at any rate so I thought, until one day to my horror and
dismay I found the headless body of the female Bed-headed Bullfinch
lying on the floor beneath the Pigmy Owl's cage, the little wretch
glaring more ferociously than ever because he felt cheated at having
in his stomach only the head !
The poor bullfinch must have clung for a moment to the wires
and been promptly seized, although how the owlet managed to pull
the bird's head through, and only its head, was puzzling. I felt like
treating that owl in the same way. It was all so unnecessary, for
the vile creature had sparrows and mice to his heart's, or rather his
stomach's content.
It certainly is disgusting when a thing like this happens which
could have been avoided. Of course the stable door was locked after

On the Bed-headed Bullfinch.
the horse was stolen, and there was the disconsolate male bullfinch
calling vociferously, and continued to do so for two or three days.
The two were devoted to one another, and I had been looking for-
ward to their nesting successfully this summer.
Like the British Bullfinch, this species is very tameable, the
male also having a charming merry song, more resembling a Linnet's
than that of our British bird's. The call note is loud and double, of
a higher pitch, I think, than the British bullfinch's, but still having
a family resemblance. It may be due to age that causes the colour
of the male Red-headed Bullfinch to vary in intensity.
Some are only dull orange, others are bright orange-red ; but
much more orange than red, so that I think it misleading to have
named this bird " Red-headed." Our British bird is red. To my
eyes, the Himalayan bird is not ! " Orange-headed Bullfinch" would
have been a moi'e appropriate name.
My male bird moulted out slightly brighter in colour than
when he was first brought from India, but not nearly so vivid as are
some of the skins in the Natural History Museum, in spite of his
diet having consisted all through the summer of fresh chickweed,
groundsel, flowering grrsses, strawberries, etc., and later on of black-
berries, elder berries, apple, plantain, and so on. Besides which
the birds were often flying loose in the bird-room, with a pan of
fresh water to wash in, which they took every and constant advan-
tage of.
Gould (Birds of Asia, Yol. 5) writes :--" This fine species
" possesses the general characteristics of the common Bullfinch of
" Europe, except in the form of the tail, which is decidedly forked,
" while in our bird it is even, and in the colour of the head, which
" is bright rufous, inclining to scarlet, instead of being black as in
"our native species. The occurrence of this bird in the collections
" of Europe was formerly so rare that the single specimen belonging
" to the Andersonian Museum at Glasgow, from which my original
" figure and description in the Century of Birds were taken, was the
" only one then known. Shortly afterwards two other examples
" arrived in England, one of which was deposited in the British
" Museum, the other in that of the Zoological Society of London,
"and these three were all the specimens then in Europe."

Any detailed description of the colouring of the sexes of this
Bullfinch is unnecessary with the extremely good coloured plate to
refer to, which gives a very accurate idea not only of the plumage
but also of the form. The picture is the result of studies from
living birds.
The Bed-headed Bullfinch is just about the same size as the
British bird, but perhaps somewhat more slender in build.

ROSELLAS.
By The Makquis of Tavistock.
The popular name of Platycercus pallidiceps is undoubtedly
open to objection, since the word ' rosella ' is nothing more than a
meaningless corruption of Bose-hill, a place which the bird in ques-
tion does not, I believe, frequent. Still, if one were to mention a
' pale-headed parrakeet,' I doubt if nine aviculturists out of ten
would be much the wiser ; so perhaps it is best after all to stick to
the familiar title. Some people are disposed to crab the Mealy
Bosella on account of the rather washy and undecided tints of his
head and neck, but to my mind he is a very lovely bird--what
Broadtail indeed is not?--and few more tasteful combinations of
colour exist than the primrose and blue which adorn the greater
part of his plumage. His disposition, alas ! does not correspond to
the beauty of his outward appearance; in fact, when fully adult and

The Mabquis of Tavistock,
in good health, he can only be described as a spiteful brute. His
two pet aversions are the Blue-bonnet and his near relative the Bed
Bosella. Alone among the Playcercinse he is often able to inspire
with fear and respect, the pert irascible little monkey in brown
and blue, while for the Bed Bosella he show&amp;apos;s a most unbounded
contempt. Hybrids between P. pallidiceps and P. eximius have
been produced in captivity and may also have occurred wild in
Australia, but in my own experience I have never known the two
species show any desire to associate except when quite young.
Even when I have had odd birds of opposite sexes flying together at
liberty for several months, they have never been seen to meet except
on the most unfriendly terms.
In November, 1912,1 obtained my first Mealy Bosellas--two
adult pairs--and turned them into a warm aviary with some other
parrakeets, who had little cause to regard their arrival as a blessing.
One of the cocks was a rather lethargic bird, and I always thought
there was something wrong with him and quite expected that he
would die. However, he survived until the spring, when I cut the
wings of all four and turned them into a grass enclosure. Here
trouble began, for the stronger cock set upon his companion and
would probably have killed him if I had not come to the rescue. It
is nearly always the case that when two parrakeets have had their
wings cut the weaker bird is unable to escape in the event of a
serious fight. When he had recovered from his injuries, I placed
the victim in another enclosure, where he was promptly attacked
by a Bed Bosella, and again had to be saved from an untimely end.
As it was evident that the poor bird needed exercise and unlimited
green food more than his oppressors, I shut up the first cock Mealy
and obliged him, as a well-deserved penance, to watch from inside
a cage the spectacle of his rival enjoying, in the society of the tw T o
hens, the amenities of a semi-free existence. The treatment an-
swered well as far as the invalid was concerned, and by the end
of the summer he had greatly improved, and was quite lively and
even bumptious. During September one of the hens moulted and
flew out of the enclosure, and as her mate in the cage was also
able to fly he was allowed to join her at liberty. Not long after-
wards the second cock made his exit, and as his wife was rather

slow in getting her new wing feathers, she was caged and put
near a clump of tall evergreens, where her partner spent most of
his time. He was very attentive to her and used often to feed her
through the wire-netting, but one cold morning he was, to my dis-
appointment, picked up dead, so all my care for him had been
in vain ; probably he had never had a very strong constitution.
The first pair, however, stayed and flourished, and by the
end of October had established themselves in a nest-box I had put
up in a tall oak tree. For some weeks we saw nothing of the hen.
Then she began to make occasional appearances with her mate, and,
in spite of the unfavourable weather [for it was now winter], I had
great hopes of young being reared, but the day arrived--how well
most of us know it--when the old birds went no more to their nest.
With dreary forebodings a ladder was brought and placed against the
tree. Out of the box were turned the mangled corpses of some
baby Mealies, a black American squirrel, and a vast quantity of dry
leaves and other household comforts which the latter had collected
for his use. I sincerely trust that the night following his eviction
was the coldest and most uncomfortable he spent in his life !
But the bereaved parents were not discouraged, and a few
weeks later were nesting in another box at some distance from the
scene of their first venture. After the hen had been absent for a
month I noticed a sinister circumstance, her mate was accompanying
the second hen (who had been released seveial weeks previously)
and was feeding her and generally treating her as his espoused wife.
Broadtail Parrakeets are, with individual exceptions, models of con-
jugal fidelity ; so I was not surprised, on examination of the nest-
box, to find that my worst fears were realized and that it was empty.
Evidently the sitting bird had been killed, probably by an owl, as
the entrance holes to the boxes were at that time far too large.
After a short time, the Mealy and his new wife were joined
by a hen Brown's Parrakeet, who had fallen in love with him and
made strenuous efforts latterly, I am sorry to say with some success,
to monopolize his affections. But fate was still against me; the
cock Mealy, like all his tribe, was an aggressive bird, and for many
weeks his supremacy had been unchallenged in that part of the
garden which he considered his particular domain. One afternoon,

The Marquis of Tavistock,
a Bauer's Parrakeet turned up with his Barnard wife at the Mealy's
favourite feeding tray. A battle followed, and next morning I found,
to my disgust, that the Mealy had had his upper mandible bitten
clean off at the root, so of course nothing remained but to catch
the poor fellow and put an end to his sufferings. That was the last
of the Bauer's misdeeds and he paid for it by forfeiting his liberty.
He was a handsome bird and a model parent, but he dearly loved a
row and his tactics were murderous. Only a few days before I
caught him up, I was attracted by a tremendous whistling to a
hollow tree in which a pair of Yellow-naped Parrakeets had shown
an inclination to nest. On coming up I found the Bauer and
Barnard and the two Yellow-napes having a most tremendous battle
and apparently enjoying it hugely. They fought in the branches,
and they fought in the air, and, finally, they fell to the ground to
continue the conflict on terra-firma with undiminished zest. When
I left them, for I could not wait to see the end, the two cocks were
rolling over and over in a heap, while a few feet away their wives
sparred savagely with each other for a favourable opening. No
damage was done on this occasion, for the Yellow-napes were as
skilful fighters as the Bauer, and ended, like he, in suffering the
penalty of exile for beak-biting and murder.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
To return to the Mealies, of which only one now remained :
deprived of her mate, she and the Brown's struck up a warm spinster
friendship such as occurs not infrequently among birds of various
orders. The couple even went so far as to explore nesting-holes to-
gether, the Brown's on these occasions playing the cock's part of
preliminary investigator and appraiser of the premises under con-
sideration. There are, by the way, few more amusing sights than
that afforded by a pair of Broadtail Parrakeets house-hunting at
liberty. The male bird always takes the lead, and after the most
superficial and inadequate inspection of some cavity in a tree or
building, will spend hours in proclaiming the surpassing excellence
of his find, even though his wife has been well aware at the end of
the first minute that the hole is for some obvious reason wholly im-
One wonders whether this destructive warfare goes on in Australia, since
Lord Tavistock's birds had all the advantages of the wild ones.--ED.

possible as a nesting-place. However, she is very patient and listens
to him most dutifully for a long time, finally giving a little chuckle,
as much as to say, " Yes, dear, I know it is a most beautiful hole,
and a most wonderful hole, only unfortunately it is so small that I
cannot get into it, and even if I could, there are quite six inches of
water at the bottom, which would be bad for our eggs. Let us go
and have a look somewhere else."
But the Brown's and Mealy never got as far as nesting, for one
morning I noticed the latter looking ill, and a second glance showed
that she had been injured in the same way as her mate, and had
lost the upper half of her beak. Probably the Yellow-napes were
the culprits as the Bauer had been shut up some weeks before.
Thus ended my first attempt to acclimatize P. pallidiceps ; there was
nothing for it but to try again and hope for better luck.
Some weeks before the death of the last of the original im-
portation, I had bought six young Mealies from a dealer, with which
to replenish my vanishing stock. They were in poor condition on
arrival and two died, but with warmth and good feeding I managed
to pull the rest round. Although not, as I at first thought, Blue-
cheeked Parrakeets (P. amathusia) the new birds, which were said
to have come from North Australia, were rather different from
typical " Moreton Bay " Mealies. They were considerably bluer on
the neck and cheeks and some had a quantity of reddish feathers on
the crown of the head, such as are rarely seen in birds from S. E.
Queensland.
When summer arrived I turned them out with cut wings,
together with a few typical Pallidiceps that X had obtained in April
and May. A few were lost from chills, accidents, and straying, but
on the whole I was fairly lucky, and by November two pairs and an
odd hen were flying about the garden.
The paired birds came regularly to the feeding-trays, and
spent a good deal of time examining holes in trees as if with a view
to nesting ; but as most adult Broadtails at liberty go house-hunting
nearly the whole year round, I was not much disappointed when
the weeks went by and nothing more happened. The odd hen,
unlike her married kinsfolk, was a great wanderer, and in company
with a young wild-bred Port Adelaide of her own sex, was often

The Marquis of Tavistock,
absent from home for several weeks at a time. More than once we
gave the couple up for lost, but sooner or later they would return,
looking none the worse for their adventures and lack of artificial food.
In March, the Adelaide found a mate of her own species, and the
newly-wedded couple proceeded to make it extremely plain to the poor
Mealy that honeymoons are intended for two and not three, and
thenceforward she was compelled to lead a solitary existence. About
the same time one of the cock Mealies mysteriously disappeared, and
as I was afraid that the unmated hens would stray and get lost, I
obtained two acclimatized male birds from the Zoological Gardens.
One of these, a rather scrubby individual with a broken tail, behaved
in an exemplary manner and took up with the widow at once. Less
than twenty-four hours after his release, I saw him sitting on the
branch of a dead oak, energetically waggling his one tail-feather and
whistling to his bride in a hole beneath him. But the other cock--
though a much finer bird--conducted himself in a foolish and "con-
trary " fashion. He would have nothing to do with the spinster,
and after a few days he wandered off and was caught and returned
to me in a starving condition. I let him out again, and again he
strayed, so I gave him up as a bad job and cut his wing when I had
managed to get him back. In April, further ill-luck arrived ; the
broken-tailed cock disappeared, and not long afterwards the odd hen
was picked up dead of chill. It is curious how birds, which have
spent the whole winter out of doors and are apparently in the pink
of condition and as hard as nails, will sometimes catch cold and die
during a spell of comparatively mild weather in spring, even though
they are not moulting. But better things were in store ; the best
pair of Mealies had for some time been visiting a tree about a mile
away from the garden, the cock was feeding the hen and every day
we expected to see him appear alone. It often happens, however, that
parrakeets, after fussing round a hole for weeks, will tire of it at the
last moment and go and settle down quickly in quite a different
place. The Mealies were an illustration of this, for they suddenly
decided that there was no place like home, and almost before we
realized that they had deserted their favourite haunt we found that
the hen was sitting in a hollow oak close to the lodge gates; the
very same tree in fact in which the Bauer and Yellow-napes had

fought so desperately the year before. Her behaviour during in-
cubation was not quite like that of other female Platycerci I have
watched which have been fed by their mates at the entrance to the
nest, and hardly seemed to leave it at all for some weeks. The
Mealy, however, on hearing the cock's call note, would slip out and
join him. He would then feed her and the pair would fly off to-
gether and remain away for some minutes. On their return, the
hen would fly straight to the hole and dive in without waiting to
look round, as though she feared that some harm might have over-
taken her precious eggs during her absence. Fortunately her fears,
if she had any, were never realized ; everything went well, and in
due course six fine young birds made their appearance and were well
looked after by their father until able to take care of themselves.
About ten days after the young had flown, the hen went to nest
again in the same hole and a brood of four were successfully reared.
Immature Mealies differ little in plumage from their parents, but
their colours, especially the blues and creams, are less pure and vivid
owing to a smoky greenish tinge, w T hich is particularly noticeable on
the head and neck. Their beaks also are of the peculiar shade which
is seen in young Red Rosellas, as if bone or ivory had been stained
with reddish earth. Birds which have red feathers on the crown
when in adult plumage, show considerable traces of red at the time
of leaving the nest.
The domestic career of the second hen Mealy--though less
successful than that of the first--was rather curious. Being without
a mate of her own species she paired with a Brown's Parrakeet and
went to nest in a tree in the garden. For a time all went well, and
from the behaviour of the old birds I am practically certain that
young were hatched ; but one unlucky day the Brown's discovered a
brood of Red Rosellas in the roof of a building a long way from his
own establishment. He was delighted with his find, drove off the
unfortunate parents (who were so disgusted that they went clean
away and were never seen again) and set to work to feed the en-
chanting babies himself. A few days later he introduced them to
his wife and soon persuaded her to desert her home and devote her
self entirely to his new charges. The Rosellas were reared--even
one which left the nest prematurely and injured itself, being fed by

its foster parents through the bars of a cage until well and old
enough to be released. Still I could not help feeling rather disgusted
with the Brown's, for his officious meddling with his neighbour's
affairs and neglect of his own had cost me a breeding pair of
Bosellas and probably a nest of hybrids as well!
During the course of last summer, two new Mealies came
into my possession--both, unfortunately, to die after a few weeks--
which were interesting from a scientific point of view, and showed
curious variations of plumage. The first, a hen, had the crown of
the head thickly covered with strawberry-pink feathers, and showed
besides, an unusual amount of blue on the cheeks and on the upper
part of the neck. A tendency to erythrism, it may be noted, is
characteristic of several species of Australian Parrakeets ; individual
Brown's, Bosellas, Yellow-bellies, and Manv-colours often showing
an abnormal amount of red in their plumage. The case of the Bed-
vented Blue-bonnet is very similar, and personally I do not consider
Psephotus Inoematorrhous as really a good species.
The second bird I received was a typical P. amathusia, the
first I have ever seen alive. He was much paler in colour than the
hen just mentioned, quite like an ordinary " Moreton Bay " Bosella
in many respects, but he had a dark-blue patch on the lower cheek,
not the circular patch one sees in a Pennant or Yellow-rump, which
starts from the base of the lower mandible but a kind of half-moon
lying low on the cheek and not reaching the beak at all. Although
this blue cheek patch is a very noticeable feature, the general resem-
blance between P. amathusia and P. pallicliceps is so striking that
one can hardly fail to regard them as local races of one variable
species, and a series of skins obtained from different localities would
probably show the complete gradation of one form into the other.
In describing the habits of my Mealy Bosellas there is one
point I have forgotten to mention, viz., their playfulness. The
Platycerci as a family are very serious-minded birds, and do not
give themselves up to light-hearted antics. But here the Mealy is
rather an exception, and I have sometimes seen my birds playing in
true parrot fashion ; turning somersaults, throwing bits of stick
about, lying on their backs and hopping wildly round with spread
tails. I once had a Barnard's Parrakeet who behaved in much the

same fashion, apparently from delight at the successful hatching&amp;apos; of
his first family (he was quite a young bird). But I have never
known another of his species forget his dignity to such an extent,
and the Mealy Rosella is the only true Broadtail that I have
often seen play.

A pair of South African Colies (Colius striatus) nested and
successfully reared two young ones last summer; and the following
notes, though somewhat meagre, may be of interest, as I am not aware
that this species has been previously bred in confinement. I see by
my notes that it was during the latter half of November, 1913, that
six South African Colies came into my possession ; these birds in a
wild state always go about in little parties of six to eight, so I was
anxious to keep all mine alive, but all of them were in very poor con-
dition when they arrived, and, in spite of every care, died oft one by
one, until only two were left. These however began to thrive, and
after having been kept in a large cage all the winter, were turned into
a big aviary with open flight and shelter, during May; here they very
quickly made themselves at home, and were generally in the open,
hanging, often head downwards, by their strong feet on to the wire
sides of the flight, wherever they could get the most sun; or else
climbing about in the thick undergrowth and bushes growing in
their aviary.
In British East Africa, where Colies of two or three species
are found, I used to see them very commonly, flying out from a
bush singly one after the other, with their quick sharp flight, some-
what like a Parrakeet's ; the natives used to say they were good
to eat, but I never tried one. In confinement they are rather
greedy birds, and are very apt to over-eat themselves, and become,
unless care is taken to prevent it, enormously fat.
It was not until June 26th that I noticed one of the Colies

was missing, and presently discovered that she was sitting on a
nest made on the top of a lid of a hamper, fixed up at the back of
the shelter in the aviary ; in fact, the identical lid on which the
White-crested Touracous had nested in 1913.
The Coly and its nest were completely hidden from view by a
thick bough of Scotch fir, and I did not dare take more than a
momentary glance for fear of disturbing her. I feel convinced, and
my bird-man is equally sure, that incubation can only just have
begun on the 26th, if she had begun to sit before that we should
have missed her sooner. Unfortunately I went abroad on July 4th,
and up to that date there had been no change in the situation and I
can only relate therefore subsequent events second-hand. Apparently
the old bird sat extremely well, and when she came off to feed, the
cock took her place; in any case, they were never seen in the flight
together, one was always on the nest, though as the sexes are iden-
tical, the bird-man was not certain whether it was not the hen, and
whether she may not have come off to feed when no one was there.
He thinks the incubation period lasted about a fortnight, at any
rate, on July 16th both old birds were out in the flight at the same
time and he was able for the first time to look into the nest, which
he describes as cup-shaped and untidily made with bits of hay and
grass; inside he found two well-feathered young ones, evidently
hatched some days; he says they were comical looking little objects,
with their crests already quite long.
The old birds fed them assiduously, carrying small bits of
soft banana to them, and on this food they were reared entirely.
When I came home from abroad on August 1st, the young ones
were flying about with their parents, from which even then they
were difficult to tell apart, except that they were rather lighter in
colour and their tail-feathers were not so long.
I shall be glad to hear whether any member knows of this
species having been previously bred in confinement/&quot;

By W. H. St. Quintin.
The effect of modern high explosives has been brought home
to all of us during the events of the past few months. It may be
worth recording that the concussion, which has such a paralysing
effect upon man, when the explosion takes place in his immediate
neighbourhood, can, in the case of small living creatures, actually
destroy life without any external injury being visible.
Mr. W. J. Clarke, the well-known naturalist of Scarborough,
tells me that on Wednesday, the 16th of December, when the
cowardly attack upon the defenceless town was at its height, a large
shell fell in the garden of the next house to his own. Just inside
his sitting-room window, and about a foot from the glass, was a
cage in which Mr. Clarke kept a collection of small seed-eaters,
all in good health, and many of which he had had for several years.
Curiously enough not a pane of glass was cracked, perhaps because
each window was open an inch or two at the top, although every
sash cord in five windows was broken and a collection of cacti was
thrown down off the window sill (inside). But the result was
disastrous to the poor little cage birds. Shells were falling so
thickly in that part of Scarborough that people left their homes
and rushed out into the country. Mr. Clarke does not think that
any birds were dead when he left the house with his wife, but when
the German vessels had gone, and he returned some two hours later,
two of the birds--a Common Waxbill and a Cordon Bleu--were
dead, and the others were sitting moping about the cage, flying
wildly about if disturbed. Next morning a Cutthroat was dead,
and between that day and the following Monday he lost four more ;
altogether six birds succumbed out of eleven.
Mr. and Mrs. Clarke were rendered quite deaf by the con-
cussion and remained so for several days. Under the circumstances
it is not surprising that no special examination was made of the
dead birds, otherwise it would have been interesting if the exact
nature of the injury could have been ascertained.

A TAME RAVEN.
By Reginald Phillipps.

<bodyText confidence="0.997964617647059" page_id="32670242"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
My garden here in London is covered over with wire-netting;
and in it for some years I had a Raven ; and the Raven's name was
Grip.
Grip was quite a boy when he came to me, and, like other
boys, had to learn his lessons.
Now Grip used to listen to all that was said to him with the
greatest attention ; with his head on one side, he would sit like a
statue till his lessons were over, taking in every word to the best of
his ability.
After lessons, Grip would no longer sit still and mute.
Having refreshed himself with a good shake, and satisfied himself
that the coast was clear, he would carefully repeat over what he
had heard. Thus the wise learn.
Solomon tells us that to every thing there is a season, and a
time to every purpose under the heaven ; a time to laugh : a time to
speak ; and so on for other matters. Grip gave this the consider-
ation due to so great an authority, and arrived at the conclusion
that, if there was one time more suitable than another for a good
laugh and a good speak, the early morning was that time. He
thought that, as none were about to see him, none would be near
enough to hear him. For this reason he went through his per-
formances while hidden away in a shed, Ostrich-like thinking that
where he could not see he could not be seen. In the gray dawn,
he would begin with a sepulchral Halloo ! Halloo ! which, having
been gone over to his entire satisfaction, would be followed by
Boiv-wow, Bow-ivoiv, and then by fits of the most distressful cough-
ing, worthy of the last man in the last stage of consumption.
Then there would be an ogre-like Haw, haw , haw. Several other
words and sounds would follow in course, but sooner or later there
would come the cat. The music of the cat is not pleasing at three
or four o'clock in the morning, even when it be that of a genuine
She. But when the notes come thrilling forth from the throat
of a Raven, in a shrill falsetto voice--well, the neighbours com-
plained ; and Grip had to be shut up every night, an indignity he

so resented that he would seldom utter a word until let out again
in the morning.
Grip, I remarked just now, used to cough; but coughing was
not at any time a subject included in his school curriculum. I had
a cough ; and the cough went off, fortunately not taking me off with
it; it was soon forgotten, so thankless are we when health returns
--forgotten by all but Grip. A ring; the lady from next door is
announced:--"What a dreadful cough your husband has ! I wonder
you allow him to go into the garden such weather as this. If my
husband had such a cough, I should-." My wife opens her
eyes. She had not noticed that her husband had a cough. What
ivant of feeling ! Not worthy of such a husband ! " But you could
not have heard him coughing now, for he is in the city.'' " O-O-O-
Oh, he has been in the garden for the last half-hour, and has been
coughing so dreadfully. Indeed, you really should take more care of
him, or-." But it was only Grip.
Grip was always a very careful body. Did you offer him by
hand more food than he required for his immediate wants, he would
accept it all--trust him for that--and would stow away in his pouch
what he did not swallow; and it was wonderful what a lot of food
he did manage to stow away in that same pouch. All his super-
abundant food would be carefully hidden away in one or other of his
many larders, and was ready to hand when required. Thus he was
never in want.
Grip was very fond of water, externally and internally. He
liked it fresh and clean, and would rush to his tub on the appearance
of the water-can, and then what a splashing, and what a wetting
for anyone standing near ! Again and again he would look to you
to re-fill it; and if you emptied the contents of the can over him he
would only give utterance to a good-natured growl.
When Grip was grown up, he was allowed to have too much
of his own way, and he became somewhat troublesome. He used to
delight in flying about the aviary; and the flapping of his mighty
wings would create a panic, and seemed to shake the place to its
very foundations. On these occasions the other birds would scuttle
off, hurry-skurry, to the nearest houses for shelter. A blow from
one of Grip's wings was beyond a joke. I have myself been partially

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
stunned on more than one occasion. But Grip went further than
this: he took intense pleasure in hurling large stones about the place;
but it was sore work for his companions--and for my pockets when
I found a large food- or water-basin smashed to pieces. Indeed,
when Grip was in one of his merry humours, the aviary was not a
comfortable residence for anyone or anything. Grip one cannot
blame ; the place was too small for him ; and he had not enough
to do. A few minutes' sojourn in Grip's aviary would have given
one cause for much anxious thought for the safety of one's head.
But my readers will say that I must be drawing a long bow
to talk of a bird throwing stones. Truly, stone-throwing is not a
common accomplishment in a bird, even when that bird is a Raven,
and that Raven a Grip. Grip used to pick up a few nice handy
stones, about the size of a boy's fist, and balance them, with much
painstaking, on one of the perches, some seven feet from the ground.
These he would watch, with jealous eye and bristling feather, as an
innocent-looking White Jackdaw, a wolf in sheep's clothing, would
unconcernedly approach, with the intent, if he could get the chance,
of dashing suddenly at the stones and knocking them down, a pro-
posed movement which was almost invariably frustrated by Grip's
wariness. If one put up one's hand towards the stones, Grip would
growl and snarl like a savage watch-dog. Suddenly he would seize
the nearest, dash off round and round the aviary like a possessed
messenger from the lower regions, uttering hoarse and ominous
croaks, but still retaining the stone in his beak--with a fine dis-
regard for a certain fable, which tells of a croaking Crow and a piece
of cheese, which the croaking Crow dropped into the mouth of a
wily fox--who didn't like cheese by the way. In the midst of his
noisy passage, the iron grip would he relaxed, and the stone, im-
pelled onwards into space by the impetus of the bird's flight, would
eventually come clattering down, striking terror and dismay into
the hearts of the other inmates of the aviary.
Like many other birds, Grip was very human. Although a
good-tempered old fellow, and fond of a game of romps, especially
with boys, he was inclined to be revengeful if unfairly treated. Only
from my hand would he receive punishment in a becoming spirit.
He recognised me as his master, and me only. Between you and

me, I think this may have been because everybody else in the house
was afraid of him. At one time my wife had a favourite Jay,
which was "not all there," even the two sides of the cranium being
visibly of different sizes. Perhaps this external irregularity did not
materially affect the bird's mind, for there was nothing inside the
brain-pan, excepting possibly a little turnip or mashed potato. This
Jay went by the name of Squawker, because he was always squawk-
ing. He used persistently to hop into the Eaven's house and help
himself to his food, even taking tit-bits out of the Eaven's own
private larder ; and this he did, not like a cunning thief of a Jay,
but with the stupidity of the man who lights his pipe in a fiery
coal-pit. One day Mrs. Phillipps unfortunately happened to be in
the garden at a time when her pet went blundering in to partake of
the Eaven's food. Grip growled, and my wife--awfully afraid
of him, but willing to risk her life for her Squawker, who was uncon-
cernedly stuffing--injudiciously hit Grip with a stick, and rescued
her darling out of the jaws of the Eaven. The following day poor
Squawker, who knew how to do only three things--to squawk, to
stuff, to sleep--again flew into the Eaven's house while the master
was at home. Grip gave a gentle nip, such a gentle one, for nipping
was not at all in his line :--but with what tears and lamentations
was I received on my return home ! Nevertheless Squawker still
squawked, still stuffed, but mostly slept--for the crown of his head
had been crushed in. I put the poor creature comfortably to bed
in a basket, and the next morning found him stiff and cold, with
his head under his wing; he had had his last squawk, and his last
stuff. I cannot call to mind any other occasion of having found an
adult bird dead with its head under its wing. Again, a carpenter,
who was doing some work in the aviary, thought proper to tease
Grip. Afterwards the carpenter, stepping backwards, came some-
what near to where Grip was sitting. Only one peck, on the arm
this time ; but it woke up that carpenter. How he took off his
coat with haste, and bared his arm, and ruefully gazed on the
wound! That carpenter had forgotten Grip once; he has never
forgotten him since.
Grip had too much spare time on his beak; and the devil will
always find some work for idle beaks to do. Grip took to plucking

his own feathers, and became hideous. So he had to go. This was
sad for many reasons : it used to be told me that a Raven would
live for one hundred years ; and I have lost my chance of proving
this. But he was somewhat tiresome in a small London garden.
There was a feeling of relief all through the establishment, especially
the feathered part of it, on his departure. A friend, who I knew
would be kind to him, took him off my hands. He wrote afterwards
(I quote only a portion of what he said):--" The Raven is a most
remarkable bird! I never heard a Parrot talk as he does, it is really
startling. My daughter went out into the garden the other day
thinking I had called her! it was Grippo ! He calls all the children
by name, tells them to ' get out ' or ' come along.' ' Hurry up Joey '
is another expression he has picked up. He often causes our cook
to run out by calling, ' Anne, come here, I want you,' in my
daughter's voice. He is an extraordinary creature." So you see
Grip's lessons were not thrown away upon him ; and his habit of
paying attention to what he hears has become a life-habit. A Raven
is a capital pet where there is plenty of accommodation. Grip
would allow me to kiss, and stroke, and fondle him as any dog might
do. With gentleness and firmness, a Raven may be kept in order
without difficulty--if you are not afraid of him.

By Douglas R. Urwick.
Business took me to Portugal for the best fifteen years of my
life, during which time I never met a Portuguese who cared for
or knew anything of aviculture, though I was on friendly terms
with many, and right good fellows amongst them.
Yet the annual Bird Show at the Crystal Palace at Oporto
was always packed during the three days of its life, the exhibits
being nearly entirely poultry and pigeons, plus a few ornamental
waterfowl and some fine parrots of various sorts, and last, but not
least, a few crowded cages of foreigners from a dealer in Lisbon ; I
believe the only one in Portugal except for the usual market sheds of
indigenous birds and Canaries.

The first time I saw these little foreigners I wanted them all
and bought none; before the next Show, a year later, my aviary
was built. I suppose the Portuguese are the most wonderful car-
penters in Europe; it comes natural to the lowest of them to do
the most intricate piece of w T ork, yet they are hopelessly unpractical,
and I really think my aviary was the least practical thing they ever
made. Very small, octagonal, enormously high, with a miserable
little excrescence on one side, which did duty for a shelter, it
bore no resemblance to the plan I had drawn up; withal it was
fearfully and wonderfully made in sections, and could be put up or
taken down without even the use of a hammer. Of course, the
unpracticability did not so much matter in such an ideal climate,
and the inmates had as perfect a spot to live in as could well be
found: on a hill outside Oporto, sheltered by orange trees and
oleanders, yet looking out to the west over the bar of the river
Douro across the Atlantic.
I went to the Show armed with a large rough cage, and pro-
ceeded to give that Lisbon dealer the time of his life, though to my
surprise he would not be beaten down or bargained with after the
manner of the country, but stuck out for Es. 2,000 per pair for his
cheapest birds--about six shillings at the then rate of exchange. I
started with a few Red-faced Lovebirds (from the Portuguese Cocoa
Island of S. Thomb, he said), then several pairs, of Blue-breasted
Waxbills, a Cardinal or two (these cost more), later on a mixture of
Gold-breasted and Common Waxbills, and I finished with a pair of
pretty little Green-winged Doves (whose correct name I never knew)
and one or two odd cock Whydahs, Paradise and Pintailed ; the last
mentioned I soon got rid of, as I found them unpleasant and quarrel-
some to a degree.
I went home in triumph and turned the lot into the aviary,
except the Whydahs' tails, which stayed behind in the cage. I
should have said before that I was not ignorant of their habits and
feeding ; I had kept most of them years before in England.
The next day I re-visited the Show and was greeted as a
brother by the dealer, but I would have none of his blarney, though
I nearly fell to a wonderfully tame Toucan--what I should have
done with it Heaven knows--and refused to buy any more, nor

Mr. Douglas R. Urwick,
would I have done so had not my wife met me with the news that
she had found in another part of the Show a cage of fourteen Bull-
finches and a " Sunset " finch. The latter I persuaded its owner to
sell, I never knew its right name, it was a gorgeous Weaver of sorts,
but as Sunset finch it was known during the several years it lived
with me.
The Bullfinches I greeted as old friends. I had loved them in
England, but had never seen them in Portugal, though I had searched
for them diligently in places where I had heard they were to be
found. I bought the lot.
Afterwards I was generally in correspondence with my Lisbon
friend. He had the weirdest names for his birds, and it was pure
guesswork buying from him ; he used to call them after their colour
usually, or some habit they had. Once he wrote me he had some
very nice Botafogos (botar = to throw, fogo = fire), Peitos Celestes
(Eng. " Celestial breasts") and Ratinhos (Eng. "little mice"), so I
chanced a few and received a cage full of Avadavats, Blue-breasted
Waxbills and Bronze-wing Mannikins, as usual, beautifully packed,
and minute instructions given to the guard for the long weary
railway journey from Lisbon to Oporto.
He could get no Zebra Finches, so I got some from England
and exchanged numbers of young with him ; from England, too, I
had the usual Gouldians, Grassfinches (Long-tailed and Masked), etc.
Considering the unsuitability and crowded condition of my
aviary I was not so unsuccessful as I expected, though only the
commoner birds actually reared young to maturity; Red - faced
Lovebirds failed altogether, and though the Blue-breasted Waxbills
hatched brood after brood, never a bird lived to leave the nest.
Grassfinches, on the other hand, were uniformly successful.
My various Weavers never got beyond their wonderful nests,
nor was I successful with Nonpareil or Indigo Buntings; the Non-
pareil hens I bought turned out to be young cocks (I suppose it is
easy to tell the difference, but I knew little of this species ?) whilst
my only Indigo hen was too busy having fits to think of nesting ;
she would writhe in the most horrible contortions for ten minutes
and then stiffen out and apparently die, only to recover suddenly and
rush to the seed tray. Unlike her mate, she would not touch

insects or soft food, and perhaps this may have been the cause
of the trouble. After the fifth or sixth fit I took to letting her
loose in the chance she might pick up some suitable food, and
ultimately she disappeared after returning to the aviary many times ;
perhaps she is alive now, she would take a lot of killing!
I had one little bird--we always called her " Nannie," who
was worth her weight in gold to me---a widowed Bengalese, who
devoted her life to the rearing of children, she was never fated to
have any of her own. Some lazy Spice Birds used to lay and sit
for a few days, and then their family instinct waned ; but Nannie
was there to rear brood after brood for them with unfailing success.
She would visit, too, nest after nest of Zebras, Grassfinches, Man-
nikins, etc., and never a fledgling went hungry. The different
parents would quarrel handsomely with one another, but none of
them had an evil word or peck for Nannie.
I know nothing about the finer points of mules, but I had
what I am convinced was one of the most beautiful Goldfinch-
Canary mules ever reared : pure white with the most delicate pink
markings. I had to offer the owner a sovereign for it before he would
part. Alas ! I lost it with my " Sunset " finch and some Cardinals
in one of my tragedies ; a supplementary aviary, in which they were;
being literally blown away in a heavy storm.
I had other tragedies ; notably when the movements of some
Quail in the aviary upset the generally perfect morals of one of my
terriers, who dug his way inside and killed these ratty-looking
things, and also my poor little doves. I never saw a dog more
ashamed; he carried the corpses on a string round his neck for
two days and absolutely refused food till they dropped off. But
my terriers were always on the look out for the birds' natural
enemies, and many a stray cat fell a prey to them. They used
to watch at night in the bushes by the aviary, and a cat had little
chance against two terriers and a great Dane--all three on the
look out. They saved a Nightingale I kept in a cage, hung up
in the thickest part of a fig-tree and fed by mounting a pair of
steps. One day I left the steps by the cage and a tabby marauder
crept up them; but the dogs were not so careless as their master,
and next morning at four a.m. the Nightingale was singing his

paean, not far from the spot where the gardener had buried his
tormenter.
I never kept the birds of the country to any extent. A few
Jays and Magpies, one of the latter quite a fair talker and extra-
ordinarily tame and amusing. Once a man brought me a young
Solan Goose, picked up on the shore after a storm ; a diabolically
fierce brute, that I entrusted to my groom to feed on fresh sardines.
He soon died, and " Victorino," the groom, explained his death by
saying: "May it please your Excellency, I knew he could not live
long, as every time I gave him a sardine he brought up two."
Another time a friend wrote from the country that some Hobbies
were building near his home (a wonderful old Franciscan Monastery
in the wilds) and I asked him to send me a couple of young ones.
Later I received a box containing seventeen Kestrels, which were
duly set free.
I never kept the native bird, the Blue Thrush, which I think
attracted me most of all, though a pair nested regularly within a
stone's throw of one of our places in the Upper Douro district.
It is not scarce, but chance prevented my ever being in the right
place at the right time, and I dared not trust a Portuguese to get
one for me.
The final tragedy came when I moved house and transferred
my birds temporarily to an aviary I found ready in my new home:
a square, rather shut-in affair that had been used for pigeons. In
five days every one was dead. I attempt no explanation and
cannot bear to dwell on it. After that for a year, until I came
to live in England, my aviary was peopled by Malabar Squirrels :
jolly little chaps, but these are not aviculture, nor are the Coatis
and other vermin that shared my home.
The other day I had a deal with my Lisbon friend, who sent
me a collection of birds by steamer, in a wonderful cage of his own
invention ; another chance shot, which ended as I deserved, in a lot
of commoners, but all in perfect plumage, and not a casualty from
Lisbon to Winchester.

Lord Brabourne (Grenadier Guards) was killed in action
on the 13th of March. Although not a member of the Society, he
had written articles on South American birds, and read the
Magazine with great interest. He often corresponded with the
Editor, and was especially interested upon the subject of Humming
Birds in captivity, mentioning the fact that there are so many
beautiful species which live at high altitudes, which ought not to
need much artificial heat. Lord Brabourne's untimely death will
be a great loss to the ornithological world.
He returned from South America where he was so busily
and keenly collecting material for his great work on '' The Birds of
South America," which he was writing with Mr. Charles Chubb ;
returned to fight for King and country, only to give up his life. He
was twenty-nine.
May he, with so many others, have happiness in a new life,
and peace.

THE EDITOR hopes that any members who can write about birds, in
freedom or captivity, will always kindly do so ; and that if their articles are
not published directly, they will not be under the impression that their labours
were unnecessary, or unappreciated.
Articles that are accompanied by photographic illustrations cannot appear
in some cases until after a certain lapse of time, owing to the expense of the
illustrations, which have to be limited, whilst in the case of other copy, it is
not always an easy task to fit in what the Editor would like to publish without
delay, since the number of pages have to be limited, in the Magazine.
If therefore some members who are good enough to write, find that their
literary contributions are pro. tern, pigeon-holed, the Editor hastens to assure
them that such pen-fruit is none the less appreciated.
NIGHTJAR, SNIPE, AND PHALARAOPE.
SIR,--I have read the letters by Mr. Galloway and Mr. Rattigan in the
March number of the Magazine with great interest, and should be glad if you
can find room to add these few queries and notes in your next issue. Mr.
Galloway does not say if his tame Nightjar ever learnt to feed itself. I caught a
nearly full grown young one on August 1st last year (it could flv about 20 yards at a
time), I put it into a cartridge bag, where it had to remain all day, and in the evening
brought it home and stuffed it with moths, etc., it soon learnt to open its mouth
(one can't call it anything else !) when it was hungry and I took to feeding it
almost entirely on grasshoppers, a most unnatural diet, but it throve very well on
them- Of course I gave it some moths and butterflies as well. I kept it for a
fortnight and then gave it to some friends near by, who still have it, but it has&amp;apos;
never learnt to feed itself and always has to be hand fed ; it is now extra-
ordinarily tame and likes to sit on a log by the fireside, it has had several narrow
escapes from being trodden on, as it spends all the day loose in the schoolroom.
It steadfastly refuses any " soft " food, and only has maggots, mealworms, and
raw meat, and occasionally hard-boiled egg now that insects are impossible to
get, but it is in perfect health and condition. Mr. Heatley Noble tells me that
he knew of another tame Nightjar which never learnt to feed itself, and I should
be glad if Mr. Galloway would let me know if his ever did so. The subject of
these notes made a few half-hearted efforts to catch moths thrown up for it
in the summer, but now it won't try at all !
Be Mr. Rattigan's article, I must differ from him where he says that the
Snipe " is a delightful bird for an aviary."
The Snipe is most certainly a perfectly charming cage bird, but compared
with other Waders not a good aviary bird. Kept in an aviary a Snipe must be

pinioned, and half the pleasure of keeping Waders is in watching their flight.
They are nearly all of them exceedingly agile on the wing and very clever at
avoiding obstacles, i.e., the supports, sides and roof of the aviary : a Knot,
Dunlin or Ruff will never knock itself about, but I would never put a full-winged
Snipe, however tame, into an aviary for even one night. My old Snipe,
mentioned in Mr. Barnby Smith's recent article, was so tame that I had no
qualms about putting him into my pocket and taking him out and dumping him
down by a pond or stream (although absolutely full-winged) and letting him
probe for worms, etc., but I would never have left him in an aviary by himself--he
always inhabited a large cage in my smoking room, for sometimes he had for
companions another Snipe and a Woodcock. This second Snipe was very fairly
tame, but I found him one morning with his right eye nearly smashed out of
his head and his head fearfully bruised. He had obviously dashed against the
top of the cage in the night, and had managed to get up sufficient impetus in
quite a small space to nearly kill himself: had he been in an aviary where he
would have had more room to " get going," he would certainly have done so.
I don't believe it is fright that makes Snipe suddenly dash up at night
(though, of course, the sudden advent of a cat or Owl on the roof of the aviary
would be fatal) but they seem to forget the wire netting at night, and being very
quick starters, hit the sides or roof of the aviary with tremendous force.
At different times I have kept five Snipe for various periods, the one great
drawback to them is their enormous appetites, and they MUST have worms and
more worms ! Some of my Snipe have steadfastly refused any artificial food,
even raw liver, chopped up, and these are the ones that have lived longest. My
old bird, which I had for 2# years, never touched artificial food after he was a
month old, though I did my best to make him. He loved maggots and fresh-
water shrimps. I have always found that the ones which would eat soft food (and
they get to love it) always suddenly went thin, but recovered if one stopped
the soft food and only gave live food fora time. Lots of grit is essential--and
water.
A short time ago I received a Snipe from Mr. St. Quintin, which had been
picked up under a telegraph wire ten days before he sent it to me. It reached
me thin, but otherwise sound I think ; though Mr. St. Quintin told me that its
left wing was badly bruised high up when it was found, but this is nearly right
again now, and as its appetite is good I think it will soon be quite fit ; it is
an exceptionally large bird, and when it has got into really good order should be a
beauty. He is sharing a cage with another gift I received from Mr. St. Quintin
about two months ago which, next to my old Snipe, is about the most charming
bird I ever had. A male Red-necked Phalarope. He was imported from Iceland
by Mr. Barnby Smith in thesummer of 1912, and had, until Mr. St. Quintin very
kindly sent it to me, been atScampstonall the time. Mr. St. Quintin tells me that
he had been fed on " Cecto," maggots, and mealworms, which are still his staple
food, but out of curiosity I caught a lot of minnows, water beetles, boatmen, and

fresh-water shrimps and put them into his tray of water, and rather to my surprise
he fell upon the minnows in grand style, and managed to swallow quite large ones
and almost immediately became singularly adept in catching them. He was, as
I had expected, delighted with the beetles, shrimps, etc., but I had not expected
him to be so keen on the minnows. He is now in perfect condition and very
tame. When I let him out of his cage and pick up his maggot tin he runs up to
my feet and looks up, ready for me to drop maggots for him. He manages about
sixteen comfortably at a meal, and will get through a hundred minnows in the
24 hours, besides maggots, beetles, soft food, etc. !
He was not at all pleased to see the new Snipe at first, and stood on tip-
toe, pecked its head and "scolded ! " but they are now perfectly friendly
and sit about and feed side by side.
I have always thought that a Jack Snipe would make an ideal cage bird,
though I have never possessed a healthy one. I have had two or three winged "
specimens, but they never lived long and always after death proved to have had a
body wound as well, but I am certain that if one could catch an unhurt specimen
it would do well, as lam sure they are partly vegetable eaters, and would not
require so many worms as a full Snipe, which is their one drawback ! More-
over, they would very quickly tame and are among the most beautiful of
British birds. HUGH WORMALD.

DESTRUCTION OF BIRDS' NESTS AND EGGS.

<bodyText confidence="0.999466190476191" page_id="32670257"  page_num="197" year="" vol="">
SIR,--A countryman and a lover of birds and animals, I usually go
at Easter time for a fortnight's roam through some of the most beautiful parts
of rural Worcestershire, when I am horrified, each time, at the wholesale
destruction of birds' nests and the wanton cruelty to bird life generally,
perpetrated by school boys and the younger farm hands. Nests are
destroyed and the eggs smashed wholesale and if, as is the case a little
later, hatching has begun, young birds are taken from the nest and often heart-
lessly destroyed, being literally pulled to pieces limb from limb and left strewn
about the roadsides or in the fields. Moreover, Sunday of all days is made the
occasion for this horrible pursuit when young people band themseves together for the
sole purpose of 1 &amp;apos; birds-nesting' ' as they call it. On a Sunday afternoon, last year,
I came across a number of boys and girls assembled in an orchard where, having
robbed all the nests they could find in the fields round about, they were engaged
in a sordid competition in which they vied with one another in hitting a tree
selected for a mark, with the eggs collected. Such revolting sights as these
harrow the feelings of every lover of nature and are such as to rouse the
indignation of every right-minded person. I fear that what is the case in
Worcestershire may be prevalent in other parts of the country as well. So that
I feel that something really ought to be done to put an end to this form of
youthful heartlessness and to the destruction of those creatures which add by their
presence so much to the beauty of God's creation, and which are precious, at

least to all true lovers of nature. Certainly there are the somewhat belated
police notices, setting forth the provisions and penalties of the " Protection of
Wild Birds' Acts," but these do not usually appear until some time later in the
season when a great deal of damage has already been done. For during March
and April many of the commoner birds are already busy with their nests which,
owing to the scanty foliage as yet grown upon hedge and tree, are more easily
detected. And even when these notices do appear very little attention seems to
be paid to them. Might not these bills which emanate, I presume, from the
local police stations, be sent out and posted up earlier, say at the beginning of
March, and might not the local police and others take more active steps to see
that their restrictions are complied with and offenders proceeded against. If
this were done, much of it I think would speedily cease. Then, too, could not the
excellent Society which exists for the prevention of cruelty to animals take under
its wing the cause of birds as well (perhaps it does, I do not know), and be styled
''the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Birds and Animals." At any rate I
feel that the Society should know of the prevalence of this particular kind of cruelty
and that might with good effect take this matter up. Then, again, there are
the village schools wherein considerable influence might be exerted if the masters
and mistresses would deal definitely with this subject in the early spring with a
view to inculcating in the minds of the young a love rather than a disregard
for the beauties of nature, at the same time warning them against the wicked-
ness of such wantonness. Quite apart from the desolating results to nature of
this shameless conduct which is so distressing to see, surely the pursuit of this
form of heartlessness, if left unchecked, must needs breed in the character of the
young such habits of cruelty which may, in later years, be put into practice
upon even broader and more serious lines. WILLIAM LAMBERT-BAKER.

NESTING OF QUAKER PARRAKEETS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995694" page_id="32670258"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
SIR,--In the autumn of 1912 I bought a pair of Quaker Parrakeets. These
were confined until the end of 1913 in an aviary with various other Parrots, in-
cluding two small kinds of Lovebirds, Pennants, Rosellas, as well as two Nepaulese
Blue-pies. The gradual disappearance and death of the smaller Lovebirds caused
me some apprehension. I feared rats, but could not discover means by which
they had made their entry. The Lovebirds vanished one by one, only their two
limbs being found on the floor of the aviary.
One day I found the Pie carrying round a half-dead Budgerigar, so fixed on
them as the culprits and removed them to another aviary. This however had
no effect, for the death roll continued to increase. About a month later, the
gardener hearing sounds of fighting in the aviary ran to the spot and was in time
to witness a savage attack made on a female Cockatiel by the two Quakers, and
from the effects of which she subsequently died, one wing being almost torn off.
This was the only occasion any of us saw or heard anything, and I have
come to the conclusion that in all cases the Quaker set upon the smaller Parrots

and the Bine Pies picked their bones. I at once returned the Blue Pies, there
being now no small Parrots left, and separated the Quakers. A few weeks later
they bit a hole in the wire netting and escaped. I recovered them, but they
again escaped. For a few days they flew all over the locality, but finally com-
menced to build a nest in a pollard lime tree in front of the house. Here they
stayed for about six weeks until the end of April of last year, when they
removed to a large wistaria growing on the south side of the house and close to
small copper beech. They literally denuded the beech of its twigs, with which
they built a large nest about 30 inches long, two feet across, oval in shape, with
an opening about two thirds from the top. It was extraordinarily large inside
and was well constructed to withstand the rain, for it was neatly thatched, the
twigs lying parallel and vertical and overhanging the entrance. At what time
the hen bird commenced to lay, how long she incubated, or how many eggs there
were I cannot say, for I was away from home for about a month at this period and
was only informed that the male bird had been seen carrying food to the nest.
On my return I made an examination, and could feel that it was tenanted by a
young Parrot or perhaps more. This was about the end of the first week in June.
Another examination a fortnight later, when I took out another young Parrot,
perfectly white and covered with down. Had I not known what it was, I should
have imagined it to be a young Hawk or Owl. After this I made only one more
inspection of the nest, when I found the youngster much more grown, with the
green feather beginning to show in the wings. The appetite of the family was
now prodigious. The old birds came continually to feed into the little aviary,
through the hole which they had made in the wire. About the beginning
of July, the head of two young Parrakeets were to be seen continually in
the opening of the nest, but they made no effort to fly for some little
time, when they took to the wing and were escorted by the old birds down to
the aviary. Four days later a third youngster made its appearance and
finally, to my great delight, my wife discovered that the family consisted of
four, for she noticed the six sitting together in a beech tree, where she pointed
them out to me. They were continually to be heard in the wood, pai'k
and plantation, squeaking in a most lusty fashion and continually making me
believe that I was back once more in the tropics with the wild figs and
quondongs drawing their feathered host together. R. A. DYOTT.

MEALWORM BREEDING AND STICK INSECTS.

SIR, --I am writing these notes, which are of quite an elementary nature,
for the information of new aviculturists, remembering how helpful elementary
help was to me when I first began to keep birds on a large scale, and in fact still
is. One constantly sees enquiries about breeding mealworms. The bird expert
knows all about it and succeeds, the novice has not the necessary experience
and fails.
From my own experience I am inclined to think the failure to make a

mealworm box self-supporting is generally due either to keeping the box in too
cold a place or using too small a box. For some years I had three mealworm
boxes in three different aviaries. These boxes were about 16in. X 6in. X 12in.
deep, and were placed a few inches above the heating pipes. They were warm
enough when the pipes were warm, but too cold when the heating was off. A
considerable number of worms were bred in these boxes, but they were not self-
supporting and a good many worms had to be purchased.
About ten months ago I decided to put the contents of all three boxes into
one large one. I purchased a large zinc corn bin which I half-filled with the
usual sacking cork, leather, etc., and into this I bundled my stock of worms and
beetles. The result has been most satisfactory. The mealworms had begun
to increase rapidly just before the war began and all this winter my new box has
given me an abundant supply. There may be a slight falling in supply for a
time now as so many are turning into beetles, but I think I shall have sufficient
coming on to supply all I want without buying. I think the reason for a larger
bin doing so much better than a small box is that the greater amount of sacking
and larger number of inseets generates a heat inside the box independent of
external warmth.
While writing this I have received the copy of The Field for February
27th, and in it I see that Mr. Seth-Smith mentions stick insects as food for birds
and small animals. I was going to mention the excellence of these insects as a
food, as I have used them for three or four years now. My stick insects are kept
in a wooden case with fine wire gauzes at each end for ventilation and glass doors
in front for inspection and manipulation. There is a fixed zinc tray about 2gin.
deep with about l^in. of silver sand in it. The insects are fed on bunches of
privet in jars of water and these bunches are renewed about twice a week. At
first the difficulty was how to change the privet without losing a lot of insects in
handling them. But this is quite easy to do, for all that is necessary is to place
the fresh bunches into the cage and the insects will soon transfer themselves. In
summer time it is advisable to give the old privet bunches to the birds to pick
over or there might be trouble if any stray insects found their way to choice
bushes. I notice that Mr. Seth-Smith in the Notes I refer to mentions that
a temperature of 80o is desirable for the breeding of stick insects, this however is
not my experience. I keep my breeding case in a cage room where the tempera-
ture is kept at about 6(X&amp;gt;-- 65o, and sometimes when no birds have been in this
room and the heating has been off, the thermometer has fallen to round about
50o. I find these insects extremely prolific and I use them in large numbers,
especially for delicate birds and those that may be out of sorts, as they are more
digestible than mealworms. The old insects die after laying their eggs, but the
dead bodies cause no smell as they dry up directly. These are quite interesting
creatures apart from their food value and they have an extraordinary power of
changing their colour to match whatever they may be on. If they are on the
wood work of their case they will turn brown, but on the privet they are green.

By Mrs. Gregory.
In the Spring of last year a friend living in Buenos Ayres
sent me over a pair of Patagonian Lapwings, called in their native
land " Teru-Teru," from their shrill cry, which is supposed to be
like the word. Mr. Hudson describes these birds in his books on
Patagonia, and in a letter from him, which I received last year, he
tells me they are great favourites of his, and that he has " a hundred
memories of their curious ways." He also told me he could not
walk anywhere at any hour on the plains without having a number
rising up and wheeling about his head, making a great outcry. He
added he remembered an English lady saying she liked the country
very well, but the Teru-Teru spoilt her pleasure. She could never
get away from them. They were always deafening her with their
angry screams, and darting at her head with their spurs, but Mr.
Hudson thinks it is different now, as the bird exterminators have
been as busy in Buenos Ayres as in most places.
Well, I met my birds at Southampton docks, and received them
from the cook on one of the Royal Mail boats. They did not
seem very bold then ; their feathers were draggled and they looked
very miserable. I got them home quickly and put them into a large
aviary and I thought they would never stop drinking from the deep
pan of fresh water, so thirsty were they. Next day I let them loose
in the garden, and it was pretty to see their delight and the way
they ran over the lawn tapping for worms to come out. They

But the hen bird remained weak for some time. Unlike most
small birds they seemed to understand the boundaries of their
domain and never hid in bushes or tried to escape, even if the gate
stood open. In some ways they reminded me of Cranes [in minia-
ture] , for when not hunting for insects, or bathing, they stood in
repose on one leg and always preferred to be close beside the large
birds. Not eating the same food probably made them all more
friendly together. Teru eat worms, slugs, and all kinds of insects ;
in addition I gave them twice a day a little raw beef cut very finely.
After a few days they would eat from mv hand and liked to stand
close by me. They are intelligent and have no fear of strangers,
but they are too small to keep comfortably in a garden; I feared
cats and rats, but no doubt the presence of the big Cranes kept the
former away.
These little Patagonian Lapwing are made much of in their
own country, and the friend who sent them says almost everyone
keeps them, for they act as watch dogs and run up and call loudly
when anyone approaches the house. One thing I am sure of, they
would not like to be in an aviary, however large.
They are not to be compared as pets to Trumpeter Birds
[from the same country]. I wrote an article in the Avicultural
Magazine for 1908 on a Trumpeter Bird I then had for just over a
year. I am fortunate enough at the present time to possess another
one, which I call " Penini," and well he answers to his name. I
should like to say a little about him, for I do not think there
are any birds so interesting, intelligent, and fond of human beings
in general as the Trumpeters. My own bird never likes to be
without the company of humans : birds he does not care for, and
seems to be only interested in them when he helps me drive them
into their houses at night, and very excited and fierce he is with
them unless they obey instantly. He waits and watches for hours
outside the windows for someone to come out and walk, when he
follows up and down the paths like a dog, and indeed has been for
some distance on the road with me, and is fond of coming after me
into our Vicar's garden, where he makes himself quite at home.
Now, it is not aviculture to write of monkeys, but I cannot help

saying I have a tiny "-white-nosed" monkey from the Gold Coast
the dearest little pet imaginable, with whom Penini plays. They
are companions to each other, and in many ways there is a resem-
blance between them. Both are full of mischief, and if I am busy
washing the leaves of a plant, they will snatch up the sponge and rush
off with it, just for the fun of having a mad race round the garden :
and then, what they don't like quite so well, is being seized and held
until the sponge has to be rescued by main force ! Both Trumpeter
Bird and monkey sleep in the house and breakfast with us in the
dining room. When there is no frost the Trumpeter flies out of the
window afterwards, and should the monkey at any time be left in a
conservatory or aviary [empty, bien entendu] the Trumpeter will
stand beside the door to watch and keep him company. Then
when Puck is allowed freedom, and swings and throws himself from
one branch to another in the large trees, Penini will be found under
an Arbutus tree, very often eating the bright red fruit that the
monkey picks and throws down to him.
I have learnt much about keeping Trumpeters from my last
experience, when I lost my poor bird through its feet getting frost
bitten. Now, I know that they must never stand on frosty ground,
though rain in moderation does not seem to hurt them, and both my
birds bathed many times in the pond during the coldest winter
months. Also, I know better now how to feed them! my present bird
has much raw beef, with plenty of fat (which he likes best) fresh
every morning, rice pudding in the afternoon, and grapes, banana,
and little bits of cake occasionally, of which he is very fond ; besides
bits of bread, biscuit, and sometimes the head of a sole, the only
part of the fish he cares for. I was told to feed my first bird on
rice, boiled in water, (this one will not eat it ) and vegetables, which
neither bird would eat, also hard-boiled eggs, which they will not eat
for long. Meat is what they require, in addition to insects they
pick up, which are few in winter. My bird is in perfect health, and
best of all, plump and full of spirit. He has never ailed a day since
I bought him from Mr. Cross nearly two years ago, who told me he
had been a fortnight in England, and had been the pet of a Brazilian
lady who brought him over but could not keep him.
The difficulty with Trumpeter Birds is that they cannot sleep

in any outside shed in winter. Fortunately I have a small room
indoors, which is slightly heated. In a recess, a thick natural perch
is fixed across, on which Penini sleeps ; a curtain over the window,
and a screen to prevent his jumping down, till I fetch him in the
morning, complete the arrangement for his and our comfort. At
dusk he will walk in at the front door and solemnly proceed upstairs
to bed. These birds, more than tame as they are, dislike being
handled or carried, except when allowed to step on one's wrist.
On the other hand, they will jump on to one's lap, and love to
have the head and neck stroked and caressed. They are most
affectionate, but differ from the monkey, who gives all his love to
me alone.
Trumpeters will be friends with and make much of the
merest strangers, and are interested in any human being who opens
the gate, be he postman or dustman or errand boy. They will run
up and welcome him with pretty twittering sounds, but the louder
real trumpeting note is reserved usually for small children with bare
legs. Unless they are old enough for stockings it is unwise to have
them in the garden, and both my birds have attacked children's legs
quite fiercely, tears being the consequence. Nothing seems to excite
these birds more, except the sight of a dog or cat.

By The Duchess of Bedford.
The following notes have been made during two cruises
round the north and west coasts of Scotland this summer, 1914.
My yachting season began with the usual spring visit to Fair
Isle on the 29th April. The north-west wind, which favours land-
ing on this often inacessible island, is not the one which is most
conducive to the arrival of migrant birds, and it was not until the
8th of May that any number of them appeared.
On that day, when the wind had been blowing strongly for

some hours from the east and rain had fallen heavily, a Swallow
flew slowly in at my window and settled on the window-sill, a
welcome sight to one who had been tramping over the island for
hours every day, seeing little but the resident birds.
A very short walk from my cottage revealed that a number of
the common migrants had arrived, as well as many of the more local
species, such as White Wagtails, Pied Flycatchers, etc., but the only
birds worthy of special note were the Ortolan Buntings. It was
difficult to estimate their number, for, as too often happens on Fair
Isle, the weather which brings the birds makes the watching of them
all but impossible ; but every little patch of ploughed land held one
or more, and I can only have seen a very small proportion of the
arrivals. They remained on the island a few days in rapidly
decreasing numbers.
On the 15th May, when steaming up the Moray Firth, I saw
a small flock of about twelve to fifteen Brent Geese. At the Shiant
Isles a very pretty Pied Puffin was observed.
On the 23rd May I visited St. Kilda. The most common
birds inland at the time of my visit were Whimbrels, Wheatears,
Twites, and White Wagtails. The Wimbrels were all over the island
both on cultivated and uncultivated ground. Meadow-pipits, Rock-
pipits, and Tree-sparrows were also common round the houses.
There were a few Hooded Crows, but doubtless the greater number of
the resident birds were away breeding on the cliffs. Several St.
Kilda Wrens were noticed about the houses and " cleits," where the
natives kept their fuel.
St. Kilda is well known as one of the principal resorts in
Great Britain of the Fulmar. At the time of my visit the inhabitants
were bringing in boat-loads which had been noosed on the cliffs. It
would seem a short-sighted policy for a people which depends
largely upon these birds for a living to kill them at this season of
the year ; but, judging from the numbers, the practice has apparently
been carried on with impunity in the past. I was fortunate enough
to obtain one of the rare " Blue Fulmars," the only one seen amongst
thousands of others. The bill is not " blue " as described to Mr.
Eagle Clarke (see Studies in Bird Migration, ii., p. 24), but appeared
to be very like that of the Common Fulmar, though I had not the

two in my hand at the same time. The nostrils are dark slate and
the rest of the bill greenish yellow, getting more horn-coloured
towards the tip. If anything, the bill is less blue than that of the
local form.
Having read of St. Kilda as the resort of myriads of sea-fowl
--Kittiwakes, Razorbills, Guillemots, and Puffins--I was somewhat
surprised to find that, with the exception of the last, they were by
no means so plentiful as I had expected. I do not mean to say
that there are not thousands breeding there, but, compared with
such places as Handa and many of the other great cliff resorts, they
are distinctly scattered, and one sees no great number in the sea.
On the whole, the cliffs do not seem to have the type of ledges
they require for nesting. The greater part of them consists of small
grass slopes and short precipitous rock faces, far better adapted to
Fulmars and Puffins than to Guillemots and Razorbills. I have
seen Kittiwakes nesting on similar cliffs, but possibly the atmosphere
of Fulmar is too strong for them at St. Kilda.
There are more of the cliff-breeding birds on the south
side of Dun than any other part of the islands that I visited, but I
did not go round Soay.
The Herring Gull was the commonest of the Gulls round the
yacht in the bay. Some twenty Lesser Black-backed Gulls followed
us over from Loch Tabert--56 miles--and remained a short time,
but I saw no others during the remainder of my visit. Though
reported to have nested once (Studies in Bird Migration, ii., p. 238),
it is probable that, when seen there on other occasions, they may
have followed boats in the same way. It is astonishing the distance
that Gulls will follow a boat. I noticed a Lesser Black-back with a
broken leg, which accompanied my yacht from the Fame Islands
for a distance of 117 miles, and possibly farther, as I was unable to
watch it longer.
Two Arctic Terns were observed during my visit ; also eight
Turnstones, a Common Sandpiper, a Teal, Dunlin, Merlin, a few
Oyster-catchers, several pairs of Eider Ducks, a number of Starlings,
and a pair of Ravens.
I was fortunate enough to be able to go over to Stack Lii and
Boreray in my launch, and, though there was rather a heavy swell,

was able to go very close to both islands. At first we steamed along
under the St. Kilda cliffs and thousands of Fulmars swooped round
and over us on every side ; then, as we turned off towards Boreray,
the Fulmars thinned off and the air was thick with Gannets. Apropos
of the destruction of fish by these birds, which is now being
investigated by a Committee appointed by the Fishery Board, it may
be worth mentioning that a trawler which had been fishing round
Stack Lii and Boreray had made such a big haul of fish that they
took a rest in St. Kilda Bay from early Saturday afternoon to
Monday morning before returning home. The mate supplied the
information to my captain, and those who know anything of life on
board these trawlers will be aware that only when the fishing has
been exceptionally good can they afford themselves the luxury of a
voluntary rest both night and day.
On my return from St. Kilda on 26th May, I visited Barra, an
island that I know best under the influence of November gales. Seen
at this time of the year, in brilliant sunshine and clothed with a
carpet of Thrift, Primroses and Marsh Marigolds, it and the adjacent
islands are hardly recognisable. Most of the Waders had left, but I
saw a flock of twenty to thirty Bar-tailed Godwits* There were
also a number of Great Northern Divers in many stages of plumage,
and both Arctic and Common Terns were nesting there. Numbers of
Gannets fished in the Sound every afternoon, and, as I have seen it
stated ( The Gannet, Gurney, p. 400 &amp;gt; that they are unable to catch fish
in a perfectly calm sea, it may be of interest to mention that I
have frequently seen them fishing here, as also off the Mull of
Cantyre, when there was not a ripple on the water.
On the 16th June a great number of Manx Shearwaters were
observed off the Isles of the Sea, and again on the 17th between the
Sound of Sleat and Eigg, some being seen as far north as Gairloch.
Two Great Northern Divers were also noticed.
On the 19th June I visited the Stack of " Stack and Skerry."
The island lies about 27 miles north of the north coast of Sunderland
and 4i miles from the Sule Skerry. It is one of the principal breed-
ing resorts of the Gannet. The Stack is divided into two almost
equal portions, the sea running through a narrow cleft between the
two islands. There was too much swell for landing at the time of my

visit, though, but for this cleft, I think I might have managed it on
the south-east side.
As the estimate of the number of Gannets breeding there in
the past varies from 8,000 (Gurney) to 50,000 (Seebohm), I made
very careful observation on this point. We steamed round the
Stack on one side at a distance not exceeding 150 yards. On the
other my captain treated it with greater respect and we were
rather farther off, but I afterwards rowed round in my dinghy within
a few yards of the islands. I counted the birds before many of them
rose on a portion of the rock which was most thickly occupied, and
my opinion is that there were about 5000 at the time of my visit. If
anything, this may be a little under the mark, but I should certainly
say they were less than 6,000. I believe the over-estimation of the
numbers is due to the difficulty of separating the Gannets with the
eye from the multitude of Kittiwakes and Guillemots sitting amongst
them. I asked one of my yacht's officers how many Gannets he
thought there were, and, even after consideration, he suggested a
million ! As none of the sitting birds rose, even when I was within
a few yards of the rock in the dinghy, it was not possible to see
whether any young were hatched. I presume that the population
would be quite one-third more if counted before the young were able
to fly.
Only the upper third of the northern part of the Skerry is
occupied by nesting birds, and a very small point of rock, which
cannot hold more than half a dozen nests, on the southern portion.
At first sight the whole Stack appears to be covered in its upper half
by nesting birds ; but a closer inspection reveals that quite one in
six--but I think possibly even a larger proportion of those on the
southern part--are immature birds, not all in the dark plumage, but
still immature.
There were no Puffins, very few Razorbills, and a few Shags
with young; also a few Greater and Lesser Black-backed Gulls.
(To be continued).

When I look back at my visit to India, two pictures, for
absolute charm, stand out I think from all the rest; and this, not-
withstanding the fact that that time included experiences so interest-
ing as a Kheddah in Nepal, a visit to Nepal's amazing cities and
travels in the mountains of Sikhim. These two pictures are the
heart of the Nepal jungle, when one rode out alone in early
morning with Mahout, and that evening with the Sarus Cranes
in the desert of Rajputana. Watching a rhinoceros as it worked
its way slowly up a water-course formed an incident of the first;
but that jungle experience owed not a little of its charm to the
ways and the character of my own elephant, whose splendid per-
sonality never ceased to be for me a study of wonder and delight.
The other day, in speaking with a wounded soldier in the hospital,
the poor fellow said, " I don't seem to remember much about it, we
seemed to be always marching." Well, when one has an Indian
programme to get through it is pretty much that way. That I
think is why the other picture is that of the jhil and the Sarus
Cranes ; it was almost the only time in India when I was able to
have a really long and quiet look.
There are over 1,600 birds on the Indian list, and they are
all scientifically and fully dwelt with in the standard works ; and
the habits of the majority have been described over and over again by
writers who know their India well. There could therefore seem but
small excuse for these random experiences of a tripper. But when
we read the Editor's appeal for articles, each one of us, seeing the
devotion of his Editorship and guessing what it must mean to have
to find cargo for the ship month in and month out, feels strung up
to do his best. Hence these jottings.
The ornithologist who has time on his hands--time to creep
about and listen and speer--will hear and learn and recognise very
many birds familiar in collections, but not to be seen in a hurry
under natural conditions. Many may however be seen without
looking for them, and those noticed here are some that were

Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye,
recognised last winter as I worked my way through the more northerly
part of India to join Mr. Elwes for a trip into Nepal.
Of course the Crow comes first--the Indian House Crow,
Corvus splendens (' splendens,' I take it, because of its audacity--
Splendide audax). This bird is equally at home in the country or
the town, turning up as you eat your sandwich on the edge of the
jungle, or keeping an eye on your toilette as you get ready for dinner.
Should a pin or a stud be missed from your table the crow, more
probably than the sweeper, has carried it off. Like the crows in
Egypt these House Crows persistently worry the kites ; nor are
larger birds of prey secure from their attention. In the hilly suburb
of Colombo, for instance [this was in the year before] many vultures
came every evening to roost in the palms, and their fellow scavengers,
the crows, roosted with them. The Vultures, as long as daylight
lasted, had but little peace, for the Crows were always jumping on
their backs and pecking them hard. A Crow would sidle along the
palm-rib until it was about a foot from the vulture's tail. The
vulture might look round suspiciously, but the Crow was only sitting
there with an innocent expression, so there was nothing to be said.
But as soon as the Vulture turned its head back again and was off
its guard with one dart the crow was on its back and could just get
in one dagger of a peck before the Vulture understood and jumped.
Probably the crows were pecking at ticks, but it seemed to hurt just
the same. Buffalo and cattle generally are grateful for such attention,
but their skins are thicker.
The Indian Tree-pie (Dendrocitta rufa) w 7 ith its dark and
chestnut plumage is very noticeable. On the outskirts of the jungle
one saw parties of these birds following one another from tree to tree.
One bird in this group, the White-headed Laughing Thrush
(Garrulus leucolophus ), takes us momentarily to Sikhim. As one
rides along the narrow paths in that mountain country, one often
hears coming from the trees or scrub on the mountain side on one
hand a chorus of laughing chatter ; and then a flock of birds with
white heads will cross the path and follow one another down into
the ravine on the other hand. They are very cheery birds and seem
to keep themselves constantly amused. They belong to a very large
natural group, mostly birds of the hills.

One constantly sees about the gardens and compounds several
little grey-brown birds very busy on the ground beneath the trees.
They have a way of flying off one behind the other, very much as
our Long-tailed Tits do in England. I think it is these birds that
are popularly called the ' seven sisters.' They are the Common
Babbler ( Augya caudata ).
The Bulbuls have been so intimately woven into eastern tale
and legend that we have come to imagine that their song must be
the most beautiful thing in the world, more beautiful even than the
song of the Nightingale. I know not how this may be ; there may
possibly be a Bulbul--they are a large family--that can outvie our
own divine warbler, but I have not met it yet. But there is one
dark-crested, bright-eyed, sweetly-singing little bird that would run
the Black-cap close--the Red-vented Bulbul (Malpaster hcemorrhous ).
It is in every little garden ; in the palms, the hibiscus, everywhere.
The one little patch of bright colour is naturally not very prominent,
but there it is.
Anyone familiar with South Africa will at once recognise old
friends in the Fork-tailed Drong&amp;apos;os. The Indian one most often seen
is the Common Black Drong&amp;apos;o or "King Crow" (Dicrurus ater).
One sees it catching flies from the bungalow coping, from the dead
arms of the aloe flowers, from telegraph wires as evening falls.
In Sikhim, we saw on the very tip top of a tree, and in Nepal,
a drongo that should be the Bronzed Drongo ( Ghaptia osnea). I do
not know why I never noticed in India a bird seen several times in
the jungle of Ceylon, but it is so general in India that we may take
it as seen ; this is the Racquet-tailed Drongo ( Dissemurusparadiseus ).
A most remarkable bird, its incurved outer tail feathers reach to
twenty inches in length (Oates). The colour is blue-black.
In Sikhim also (King Charles's head will not keep out of the
story) in Sikhim, then, we once saw the lovely little Wall-Creeper
(:Tichodromia muraria). It was creeping about on the side of a rock
by the river Tista, four days out of Darjeeling. Creeping thus in
little jerks about a lichen-covered rock the bird would not be very
easily seen, but that as it creeps it opens and closes its wings,
bringing into view the beautiful crimson of the lesser wing-coverts,

Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye,
primaries and secondaries. One can get quite close to the bird as it
hunts about in its busy, pre-occupied way.
The Warblers shall be passed over, because here I feel on too
uncertain ground, though members of this large group may be seen
every day, from a Reed-warbler by a jhil to the little Green (Prima
inornata ) that haunts the compound shrubs. The same may be said
of the Shrikes, for though one often saw a Shrike perched on the
telegraph wires or hawking from the top of the aloe stems or round
about the jungle, I could seldom identify them with any certainty.
One was certainly the Indian Great Grey Shrike ( Lanius lahtora ) and
another most probably the Rufous-backed Shrike (L. erythronotus ),
and at that we must leave them.
Considering the brightness of the Orioles, they are not very
noticeable in the sun-washed trees ; only on one or two occasions I
saw one singing on the top of a tree or bush. And I never re-
member to have seen a Grackle ( Eulabes) in the wild state, though
one commonly saw them in cages.
The Rose-coloured Starling ( Pastor rosaceus ) is often seen.
It is one of those birds that comes to the Jains' feeding-towers in
the city of Ahmadabed. The Indian Starling (, Sturnus menzbieri)
seemed to me to be almost exactly like our own and had just the
same ways. This brings us to the Mynas, a group of birds which,
with the Crows and Kites, are the most familiar birds in town and
country. The Common Myna ( Acriclotheres tristis) is everywhere
and always. Its specific name is most unfair, for it is one of the
cheeriest birds that fly. This delightfully industrious and confident
bird is not confined to the plains, it goes well up into the mountains ;
we saw it in Nepal. The Bank Myna ( A. ginginianus ) is much
more local. I never saw it in large parties as one sees the former
species. A pair frequented the lawn of a house where I was staying
in Benares, and hunted carefully the grass when just mown by a
large mowing-machine drawn by two splendid oxen ; and there were
always a few on the banks of the Ganges at the foot of the town.
A third quite familiar bird is the Black-headed Myna ( Temenuchus
pagodarum). Its habits are much like those of the others.
I saw many Flycatchers in Sikhim, among them a lovely
cobalt blue one, which was probably one of the Niltava genus.

But the only one I could identify was the Paradise Flycatcher
(Terpsiphone paradisi). As I had. seen this wonderful bird more
than once in Ceylon I knew it instantly, though for that matter
no one could possibly mistake it, as it is like nothing else in bird-
kingdom. Anyone who has looked over a series of these birds in a
collection must have been struck by their great differences in
plumage. Oates gives us the change of plumage by which the male
arrives at that of its fourth autumn, when the head is black but the
body and tail white. As the body of the bird is but 4\ inches in
length, while the tail alone may measure 16i inches (Oates) it will
easily be seen what a remarkable bird this is. We are speaking of
course of the male, the female does not develop in this way. I
shall never forget the first time I saw one on the wing. I was
going along a road--it was in Ceylon--with dense jungle on either
hand, when something white that hardly looked like a bird flew
half way across the road and hung there in the air vibrating. Then
it flew back and went up into a tree in a waving ripple due to its
long tail. It seemed a very fairy of the jungle.
Although Chats and Redstarts were often seen in the Hima-
layas, and though I afterwards tried to identify some of these in the
Calcutta Museum, I feel no certainty about them, and therefore pass
on to a familiar bird, the Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis). I
have not noticed this bird in the wilder parts of the country, nor do
I remember seeing it in the Himalayas, although it is said to ascend
the mountain up to 5,000 feet (Oates), but almost everywhere else in
the gardens. I think it was even more common in Ceylon than in
India. It stands in about the same relationship to human life as
the Red-breast, which its ways closely resemble. It shares with
the Nightingale and the Grey-backed Warbler (Aedon) the pretty
habit of flirting up its tail at each stop in its movements, but does
this more persistently than either of these birds.
In the compound of a dak bungalow in Benares a little
group of grey-coloured Thrush-like birds were often seen in the
early morning hunting among the fallen leaves of a pipel tree.
They jerked the leaves over with the Blackbird's action. I think
these must have been the Dusky Ground Thrush (Mcrula unicolor).
The Blue Rock-Thrush (Petrophila cyanus ) was seen and heard

Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye,
several times in the Himalayas. We saw a Dipper on a tributary of
the Tista in Sikhim.
Beyond question the most striking of the finches seen was
the Scarlet Finch (or Grosbeak) ( Hcsmatospiza sipali), we saw it in
Sikhim. For sheer brilliancy we have nothing like this in England.
There was black about it when it flew, but sitting in a tree by the
side of the precipitous mountain track it looked a spot of fire. The
Indian House Sparrow ( Passer doviesticus) was as common and as
impertinent as our own, and in the village of Churia in Nepal there
were many Sparrows that were neither this nor the Tree Sparrow
and were not identified.
The Indian Sand Martin ( Cotile sivensis ) was often about the
rivers ; I could not have distinguished it from our own ,but it looked,
as it is, a little smaller.
The Chimney-Swallow ( Hirundo rustica) was abundant.
I do not know any bird much more difficult to detect in a tree
than the Common Green Barbet (Thereiceryx zeylonicus), unless per-
haps it be Meyer's Parrot in Africa. How often have I looked up
into a dense-leafed tree for each of them, stepping forwards, back-
wards, and round and round, gazing till my neck was stiff. Though
the Barbet had been calling until I came too close it was seldom seen,
until it took flight and was off to another tree. It flies much like a
Woodpecker. Its loud metallic call went on all day, and often as
one turned in at night in the dak bungalow there was the Barbet
still calling.
The Indian Boiler ( Coracias indica) seems to be in no way
different in habits from our Mediterranean friend. It flies with the
same Jay-like flight, it tumbles in the air, it catches insects from
its watching&amp;apos; place. In Ceylon, as I remember noticing, these birds
are curiously local. In a long motor drive you shall not see one,
and then for a mile or so on end they are sitting on the telegraph
wires every here and there.
One often hears Woodpeckers and occasionally sees one flying,
but their identification would entail more* time and watching than I
could afford, and even with that I should have certainly made
mistakes.
There are no more delightful birds than the Bee-eaters. The

Indian Bee-eater (Merops viridis ) is rather smaller in size and
brighter than our familiar European bird, but behaves in just the
same way. They may be classed among the telegraph-wire birds,
but then they are merely little huddled up bunches of green feathers.
It is when they are darting and floating about in the sun-filled air,
in which they are as much at home as a Swallow or a Erigate-bird,
that these most beautiful creatures really charm one ; one is never
tired of watching them.
You cannot be long by any water, whether river or jhil
(lake) without seeing the Indian Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle varia), a
conspicuously black and white bird about the size of our own King-
fisher. It hunts over the water like a Tern, and like a Tern some-
times hovers for a moment and then darts down. But the Common
Kingfisher (Alcedo ispida ), which fortunately is still fairly abundant
in our own islands, is just as often seen and behaves in every
respect like the bird we know here. I shall never forget a particular
scene one evening in Ceylon. It was evening&amp;apos; and the sky was
crimson where the clouds were, but low down just along the line
of the jungle it was flat and clear and tinted light green, the green
of the sea where it swells over rocks awash. We were in a motor
car in the hope of reaching Trincomali, a harbour that is a gem of
the world. We had nearly arrived at Kantalai, celebrated for its
great water-dam. I hurriedly pulled up the car as we suddenly
came upon the white iron railings of a bridge that normally
spanned a little river running through a flat of grass and rushes
with jungle all about it. But now the whole thing was in flood, the
water and the sky together making a great expanse of orange, crim-
son and red, only broken by the dark line of the jungle fringe. At
the edge of the bushes a bunch of wild swine were rooting, their
sides as red as umber from the dried mud of the wallow. On the
railings of the bridge were a row of green-blue dots--Kingfishers.
Not far from them sat two Brahminy Kites. I think the sound of
the water must have drowned the noise of the car; but as I went
on foot towards the bridge everything took life. The swine dis-
appeared in the jungle, the Kites sailed off, and the Kingfishers
darted away one after the other over the coloured flood, while a
pair of Fishing Eagles (Haliaetus leucoryphus) followed over the

road. From the water itself rose a pair of white Egrets, while a
lot of whistling ducks swam off in a line turning their heads side-
ways to look at the intruder. The scene behind this still remains
to be filled in, for the sound of branches breaking or brushing made
me turn my head, and across the road above the car swung Langur
after Langur like gymnasts from a flying trapese; and as I strolled
back flock after flock of Paroquets, some high up, some lower, came
round and round, apparently intent on roosting.
I saw Hornbills on several occasions in the noithern forests,
but they were always very high up or disappearing through the
trees and I cannot say anything about them.
The Indian Swift (C ypselus affinis ) were often noticed.
Nightjars constantly played round the Dak bungalows in the dark,
but I should not care to hazard or guess as to species.
Palceornis torquatus, the Rose-ringed Paroquet, is the com-
monest of the Paroquets, and is constantly seen about the houses.
It flies very rapidly, and one often hears its harsh voice high over-
head. This poor bird is commonly kept in most cruel metal cages
(not wire but broad flat pieces of iron) and existence must be a
torment to it in the hot sun. The Blossom-headed Paroquet (P.
cyanocephalus) though not so often noticed, excepting on the wing
(it is a bird of extremely rapid flight, and reminded me somehow of
Sandgrouse when flying) was I believe one of the paroquets that
came to the bird-trays in Ajmer.
The Owls of India are so many and so interesting that I am
sorry to have to confess that the only Indian Owl I was able to
identify was the Spotted Owl ( Athene bramci), wdiich is common in
the outskirts of villages. The habits are a mixture of those of the
Little Owl and the Burrowing Owl.
Vultures of course are constantly seen in India. Unfortu-
nately a photograph taken of a large collection of these birds--the
majority were the Indian Griffon ( Gyps indicus ), but two or three
were the Black Vulture ( Otogyps calvics) -- did not come out very
well. They were sitting drying their wings after washing. This
was near Udaipur. In Benares, as would be expected of that very
native city, Vultures are very numerous. The Indian White-back
Vulture ( Pseudogyps bengalensis) and the Griffon are the commonest

there. I take it two Vultures seen near Chakrata were the Himalayan
Griffon (G. himalayensis) but that is merely a guess ; the birds were
pretty high overhead. Neophron gingiinianus, which is only a rather
smaller edition of the Egyptian Vulture ( N. percnopterus) walks
about the dirty villages like a fowl. We saw a good deal of the
Lammergeier. One day near Chakrata there were several on the
wing at once, including one splendid old male in perfect plumage
who came close over my head. Across the valley was a cliff where
they or other Vultures evidently bred; we could not actually see an
eyrie but could make out the ledges where nests probably were.
The rocks have been literally whitewashed by the birds.
After watching Vultures in various countries., one wonders
much at the old controversies about sight and smell. But though
it is clearly sight that does it, there are sometimes conditions which
show forcibly how amazingly acute that sight is. I shot a sambur
stag one day in the depths of the Nepal jungle, and had scarcely
had time to get down from my elephant before Vultures had arrived.
Now they could not have seen that animal, unless at least one
Vulture had happened to be directly above or looking down between
the trees ; for the trees were much too close together, and even then
it was a remarkable evidence of their quickness of eye.
An Eagle, probably the Tawny Eagle ( Aquila vindneana) was
seen on several occasions from the train, sitting on posts or beating
across the fields This is not a very noble bird, but is Buzzard-like
in its ways. A bird seen on the wing more than once was Palle's
Fishing Eagle ( Haliaetus leucoryphus). I never saw it actually catch
a fish. It is a striking-looking bird, as in harrier fashion it beats
along the edges of the jhils.
Kites are almost inseparable from any memory of India.
There are two, one for the water, one for the land. The first is the
Brahminy Kite ( Haliastur Indus). As soon as you reach a port of
India you are pretty sure to see them from the deck of the ship.
It is a beautiful bird with its white head and neck and chestnut
body. A pair had their nest in a palm tree by the great lake under
the palace of Udaipur and added much to the interest of that
beautiful scene. The second is the Common Pariah Kite ( Milvus
govinda). One might write much about the bird, but it has all

Mr. B. Theo. Stewart,
been written before, for they are an unfailing sense of interest in the
streets, and indeed in the harbours, where they are more numerous
than the other Kites.
Falcons--obviously " Peregrines "--of some sort, were occa-
sionally seen on the wing, probably they were the Sh&amp;hin (Falco
peregrinator ) or the Laggar ( F. jugger ) or both. There seems very
little to say about the raptorial birds of India that are so numerous
in species from the great Lammerguer to the tiny Falconet--of
which by the way I saw one, species unknown, shot by a friend in
Nepal Terai. But travelling as we did we had little chance of
seeing these, many of which are strictly forest birds.

By B. Theo. Stewart.
The Piping Crow or Magpie of Australia figures so largely in
prose and veise that everyone ought to be familiar with the bird.
I say ought to be, but apart from Aviculturists, I have found
very few people who do not ask me the eternal question " What is
that strange looking bird ? " They appear no wiser when told, so
now I leave them guessing.
Even in my nursery days the Piping Crow stronglv appealed
to me and I determined to possess one at the earliest opportunity.
I have had many since then.
Owing to the fact that the importation of this bird is now
strictly prohibited, a heavy fine being the penalty, the price of
Piping Crows has risen by leaps and bounds -- anything up to #10
being asked by dealers, in fact, they are hardly to be procured at
any price. Times change truly -- my first Crow cost me just under
a sovereign.
Writers speak of the "joyous whistle of the Piping Crow,"
but there is little of a joyous nature about the Never-Never bird.
His notes (that is--the wild caught bird) are powerful and mellow,
but to my thinking, melancholy. As a mimic he is great, but his
talking powers are somewhat overrated; many words are very clearly

emunciated but the vocabulary is strictly limited, and never, never
will he learn to whistle the last notes of a tune.
The female of this species is not so accomplished as the
male, though equally interesting and docile. She is smaller, the
white and black of the plumage is less glossy than that of the male
bird, and her beak is feebler. One female that I possessed was
highly intelligent, you had only to show her a mouse trap and she
would tell you what ought to be in it. An empty cotton reel made
her very happy, and she would lie on her back holding the reel in
her claws and play for hours like a kitten.
I cannot claim to have bred these birds, as unlike most
aviculturists, I take no interest in breeding operations. All my birds
are therefore celibates. Necessity knows no law and there are
no quarrels in a feathered community of monks and nuns.
I have, at the present time, a remarkably fine Crow, just
over four years of age, who is known in the family circle as " Poor
Peter." He came to me as a nestling, in the dingy grey and muddy
black dress worn by the infant Magpie. He was so extremely
youthful that he could not eat correctly; as to water apparently
he had never heard or seen it, for he swallowed it in drops out
of a tea-spoon in fear and wonder.
Even now he is strangely abstemious and uses water for
bathing only (really its proper purpose!) Perches he had no use
for, preferring to roost on the cage bottom--a fad he still indulges in.
Peter belongs to the white necked, black backed variety and is
beautifully marked, the black being very black and the white very
snowy. His beak which was black at first soon changed and is
now quite a fine instrument, long and polished, greyish blue with
a black tip.
Peter always answers to his name and will run from any
part of the house or grounds, on being called, as obedient as a dog.
He is also a highly brained bird. For instance, he can fetch
and carry a ball or piece of paper, deliver it up and wait for you to
throw it. Will "shake hands" at command, sit on one's lap and
allow his feathers to be stroked, etc. He has a really charming
temperament, a trifle hasty sometimes, but as the cook said, a little
present will quickly bring him round.

On the Australian Piping C row.
Peter can talk well, but he is somewhat chary of his words.
He whistles well, but I fear his ear is a trifle defective. He
reminds me of a character in " Diplomacy," he cannot tell the
difference between " Pop goes the King " and " God save the
Weasel." Crows live to a great age, and Peter will have eternity
to learn " Pop goes, etc.," it has already taken two years to teach it
him ! ! and he sings it in the most melancholy way as if he thought
he was at a Band of Hope meeting and he wanted to burst into
tears over it.
I think Lewis Carrol would have loved Peter. A spider's
web waving on the ceiling distresses him. He thinks it looks so
lonely! and he wails over a meal-worm in the most heart-broken
way. I am sure he is genuinely sorry to have to put it to death.
Yet is he a bird of fine courage and only afraid of two things--
an umbrella and a nice red carrot. Why in the world he should be
afraid of the latter article I can&amp;apos;t think.
I read some time ago an article on the Piping Crow by Mr.
Farrar. His views and mine are quite opposed. I quote some
extracts--" They (Piping Crows) are very strong and mischievous
" and require a big strong enclosure, to keep them in ordinary wire
" netting is no good as they take a devilish delight in unwinding it
" with their massive beaks, only strong iron rods can puzzle them.
" They can even chisel through a good thick plank."
" They are smelly; bite confoundedly ; and those who handle
" them should wear leather gloves," etc.
So experienced an aviculturist as Mr. Farrar must, of course ?
be familiar with my old friend the Australian Magpie, but I confess
his description of the bird swallowing a mouse whole, eating dog
biscuit voraciously, almost devouring the plate, and so on, makes me
rub my eyes and wonder what manner of birds he possessed to
perform these feats.
My Crows eat mice, not whole, but bit by bit, raw meat
is taken in quite tiny pieces, a dead Waxbill is devoured slowly and
in fragments, etc. But, of course, my birds may have perfect table
manners, still I think it would puzzle any Crow to swallow a mouse,
full grown, at one gulp ! At any rate I have never seen it done.
My birds are kept in large box cages (I have even kept one or

two in wicker cages) the box cages have wire fronts of the weakest
description, a finger pressure would snap my bars, yet my Crows
have never damaged these in any way and they have been in
use for years.
As for being "smelly birds" that expression can never be
applied to birds properly attended to, that is, cleaned out every
day, well sanded tray, and lastly, given the very best fresh raw meat.
Many pet canaries that have been brought under my reluctant
notice deserve the unpleasant expression "smelly" far more than
the poor bird of prey. Personally, I never find it necessary to wear
thick leather gloves in handling this or any other bird. If a clumsy
handler gets bitten, I fear my only verdict would be " serve him
right."
Now, I trust Mr. Farrar will forgive me for " having a bone
to pick with him," I have tried to defend the bird's personal
character, but the poets of his native land sing his praises best and
sweetest.

Before coming to the actual subject of these photographs, it
may be as well to say something about the people who put up the
bird-feeding structures shown. There is in the west of India a
religious group of people who number about a million and a quarter
and are called Jains. They are not--like the Sikhs -- an offset from
the Hindu faith, but were independently founded at about the same
date as Buddhism, five hundred years or so before the Christian era.
They are distinguished both from the Hindu and the Buddhist by
several characteristics independently of their religion. They have,

for instance, an architecture which in certain essentials is different
from the Indio-Aryan architecture of India generally; it includes a
slight and beautiful pillar springing from a decorative base. Their
principal city is Ahmadabad in Gujarat [Bombay Presidency].
The Jains protect all animals ; no creature, even in extreme
old age, is ever killed by them. In Ahmadabad is a place called the
Pinjrapal, which is filled with yards, stalls, and cages. This place,
which is supported by voluntary contributions, always contains a
large collection of homeless and decrepit animals ; they are said to
number nearly one thousand. One sees there horses, donkeys, cattle,
sheep, goats, dogs and monkeys. At the time of my visit there were
also a Crane, a Stork, two Barn-Owls, Parrakeets and some fowls.
There is an insect-house, but this I was not brave enough to visit:
it is devoted to fleas and other personal insects. These are fed at
intervals by the expedient of placing a dog or other unfortunate
creature inside the room. I fear this must always have a balance
against the poor dog.
In some of the smaller towns -- in Ajmer for example--birds
are fed by means of a large tray suspended overhead by wires
stretched across the street, and a beautiful sight in the sun are the
Pose-ringed Paroquets who crowd to the trays chattering and hang-
ing on in amusing attitudes.
In Ahmadabad, trays are attached to trunks of the trees
that border the roads, and these are kept filled with food for the
little striped Ground-Squirrels that swarm everywhere; but the
birds are fed by a more elaborate contrivance. These take the
form of what for want of a better term I must call towers. They
are built of wood, carved and coloured, are of light and admirable
design, and no two are exactly alike. The base of each is of stone,
usually carrying a railing, or in one case a beautifully wrought metal
grille. The principle is a tall central post or wooden pillar from
which struts of artistic shape fan out to support the floor which is
really an immense tray for the birds' food. The woodwork is
elaborately carved, All are covered with roofs of an ornamental
character. The food-floor is approached by steps--by an iron or a
wooden stairway. The water is placed in a large tray, which, as
will be seen in one of the photographs, hangs independently from

wires. Many kinds of birds come to feed from these towers. Always
there are pigeons coming and going--the Indian Blue Rock-Pigeon
(C olumba intermedia ) and its many semi-domestic varieties which
swarm all over India; they are sacred birds in Rajputana, where
no one ever touches them. Rose-coloured Starlings, Doves, Paro-
quets, and other birds are generally to be seen feeding there, and
indeed Jains' bird-towers is one of the most interesting and delight-
ful things to be seen in India.
REVIEW.
"BRITISH BIRDS."
A book of birds illustrated in colour by Mr. Thorburn is sure
to be an acquisition of value, in spite of the artist having to group on
one sheet several different species, which must necessarily detract
from facts in nature, but the grouping is so good, and the individual
poses so life-like, that one's eyes can be focussed on each bird by
itself. In the case of the small Warblers, it is really an advantage,
for such puzzles to all but the expert ornithologist as the Willow
Warbler, Wood Wren, Chiff-Chaff, etc., can be compared together,
though even so, they are not easy to identify in wild life. Mr.
Thorburn's touches of natural surroundings are charmingly and
cleverly introduced, a splash of crimson thorn blossoms with the
Shrikes; a gleam of Gentiana acauiis by the Alpine Accentor;
a bunch of crocuses, yellow and white, where the Blackbird is
searching for the early worm. Perhaps owing to a loss of colouring
reproduction, the head of the Rock Thrush (Petrocincla saxatilis )
is too heavy and leaden in tone, and the Chough seems too large in
comparison with the Jay on the same sheet, especially as the latter
appears to be more in the foreground, but these are minor critic-
isms which become minimized in one's admiration for the work
as a whole.
It is in itself an ' edition de luxe,' for not everyone, especially
in these days of warfare, can afford #6 6s. Od., though we would
hasten to encourage bird-lovers with the fact that for that sum, they
have still three more volumes of a generous bulk to come, the

published.
Mr. Thorburn has himself written the text, in which he
claims no originality for his observations on birds. Anyhow, enough
is written about each one for the reader to understand something of
the ways and habits of the birds, and those who are interested in
them and who have not the good fortune to possess Lord Lilford's
" Birds of the British Isles," with Mr. Thorburn's beautiful
coloured plates, would do well, if their purse is full enough, to acquire
the present publication. H. D. A.

OBITUARY.
SIR ROLAND J. CORBET, B&amp;apos;R
The Editor has to record with sorrow, the death of his
nephew Sir Roland Corbet, Lieut. Coldstream Guards, who was
killed in action on the 15th of April. A member of our Society_
he was a keen and ever-interested observer of wild birds, and wrote
home that he had seen a Swallow flying over a canal at the front,
as early as the 25th of March. From his boyhood he had collected
books on British birds, nothing pleasing him more than to be given
any new publication on the subject. Without guile, a pure and fine
gentleman, valourous, yet shrinking with simplicity and diffidence
from all praise as a soldier of the King, he has laid down his life in
the service of his country. Wounded during the earlier stages of

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996753882352941" page_id="32670303"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
SIR,--In answer to Mr. Hugh Wormald with regard to his question as to
my Nightjar, which I kept for five years, feeding itself, I write to say that it
would not peck anything up, and seemed to have no idea of doing so. I suc-
ceeded in getting him to feed himself by having a narrow piece of wood, like a
miniature shelf, fixed along the front of the cage, so that when the bird was on
the floor of the cage, its head was level with the shelf, along the edge of which I
firmly fixed in pins about three inches apart, snipping off the heads. On these I
fixed moths, mealworms, cockchafers, pieces of insectivorous food ("Life")
made into small pellets, etc.
When the Nightjar was hungry, he would run forward and pull the food
off the pins and bolt it. There was not the slightest fear of the bird hurting
his mouth with the headless pins, because he always ran up to them and took
hold of the food only, pulling it off.
The eyesight of the Nightjar appears to be directed slightly upwards, for
he would take no notice of any live food that was placed on the floor where he
might have seen it moving, but directly food was raised level with his eyes, he
would at once snap it up. P. F. M. GALLOWAY.

A LARGE BLACK AND YELLOW TROUPIAL.
Sir,--I see by the Avicultural Magazine that you are good enough to
answer queries about members' birds. I have had offered me a large Yellow and
Black Troupial, and wondered if it would live in my outside aviary with an
Amber and Black Hangnest, pair of Afra Doves, Mandarin Starlings, Californian
Quail, etc., also would it winter outside here? My aviary is a fair size and
sheltered with glass shutters during the winter. P. BARLOW-MASSICH6.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Barlow-Massichs :--
By " a large yellow and black Troupial," as distinct from a Hangnest, I
presume that you are speaking of a Cassique--probably either Cassicus persicus
or fnelanicterus.
Although the Cassiques and Hangnests are regarded as purely fruit and
insect-eaters, I am satisfied that both are predatory upon weaker and smaller
animals ; for one of my Common Hangnests, after catching a Cordon-bleu on the
wires of its aviary, nearly tearing it to pieces and partly devouring its head,
attempted the same thing with a Zebra-finch, which, however, escaped with the
loss of two or three bunches of feathers. Later on the same bird killed and
partially devoured a small mouse which entered its aviary.
Of Cassicus persicus we read that Schlechtendal turned one loose in a room
with his African and Indian Starlings and it drove them about in the wildest
terror and so mauled them that he was obliged to remove it to a cage. I should
therefore not be inclined to trust one of these birds with anything less powerful
or more timid than itself.
In a sheltered aviary a Cassique would probably be able to stand the
winter : most Starlings are pretty hardy. A. G. BUTLER.

SIR, -- I send you a note on the migration instinct in case other members
have noticed similar points. My male Blackcap, which is now two years old,
began to sing at the beginning of January. Throughout February and half of
March he was in fairly full song. He then began to slacken. About three
weeks ago he practically stopped singing, and instead took to fluttering almost
continuously by night. He then came gradually into song again, but still
(20fch April) flutters slightly, and is not yet singing properly. Evidently following
the change of diet which he would experience by migration, he will now eat
mealworms readily, though before this season and throughout the winter he
could hardly be induced to interest himself in one. 0. J. STONE.
[I remember having a Blackcap years ago, which always fluttered by night
during the spring migration, although I do not recall that the bird did so in the
Autumn. EDITOR.]

(Concluded from page 208 ).
Leaving Stack, we steamed over to Bulgach Island, six miles
south of Cape Wrath. Here the swell again prevented my landing,
but gave me a very imposing view of the curious " Bellows" Cave at
the north end, which is a feature of the island.
The north-west side of Bulgach is almost entirely occupied by
Kittiwakes and a few Fulmars. On the south-west were great
numbers of Kittiwakes, Razorbills, Guillemots, and some Shags.
The visible population of these last was a little under one hundred,
including young. The top of the island was covered with Puffins
and Herring Gulls; and three Cormorants, a few Greater Black-
backed Gulls and Black Guillemots, were also observed on it. We
rowed over to Stack Buachaille, which is well worth seeing, but
only one or two of the ledges were occupied by birds, and these
were Fulmars and Razorbills.
All along the north coast of Sutherland, Fulmars are seen in
small numbers. Whilst in this neighbourhood I saw a number of
Black Fish, particularly between Loch Erriboll and North Rona.
On the 20th June I visited the Smoo Cave, near Durness,
and found both the Grey and Pied Wagtails breeding in it; also
Spotted Flycatchers.
The caves and stacks on the east side of the entrance to Loch
Erriboll are also well worth visiting, not on account of the birds,

which are few in number, but for the great beauty of the caves
themselves. The walls are a harmonious blending of colour--red,
green, brown and yellow--and have been carved into a succession of
pillars and arches by the Atlantic breakers, which too often render
the caves unapproachable. No imaginary grotto of fairy legend
could be more beautiful than these probably almost unknown ex-
amples of Nature's architecture.
The same day I landed on Garve Island. " The matrix, to
quote Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, " is limestone, and every inch of it
is studded with fossils." The matrix had been "weathered out " by
wind and wave, and the small fossil shells stand out so sharply
defided that one has to be careful how one clutches the rock on
landing&amp;apos;. However, it provides a security of foothold for the some-
what precipitous ascent to the top, which it has not been my luck
to find on many of these sea-girt islands. A polished surface of
rock, covered -with slippery seaweed, is the usual order of things ;
and this, combined with the Atlantic swell, renders them as a rule
sanctuaries for the birds but inaccessible to the naturalist.
I had an unexpected find in the shape of a freshly dead mole
on the island, brought there probably by the Gulls, as no mole
could find a living in such a place.
Seven Eider Ducks' nests were found, one with five young in
it; but, generally, there were only one or two eggs, several of which
were on the point of hatching, showing I think, that they are
probably robbed by the Gulls.
On the 21st June I landed for the fourth time on North
Rona, not by any of the recognised landing-places, at all of which
there was too much swell, but nearer the big cliff on the east side.
By far the most abundant birds away from the cliffs are the Lesser
Black-backed Gulls. They are nesting from one end of the island
to the other; and at this season of the year, when the ground is
thickly covered with Thrift, make a most charming contrast with
their pink and green carpet. There are comparatively few Great
Black-backed and Herring Gulls. Though there were hundreds of
Fulmars on the island, there were far fewer nesting in the ruined
houses than usual. I attribute this to the fact that two gentlemen
had put up a shelter in one of the houses and spent a few days there

about three weeks before my visit. Tame as the Fulmars are, as a
rule, they probably resented this interference with their domestic
arrangements and the fumes of tobacco, which must have been very
necessary to anyone sharing a house with them. (I found the
remains of a cigar!) I detected a Petrel in the ruined walls but
was unable to get at it, but at this date it was probably the Fork-
tailed Petrel.
When lying on the grass, with Fulmars swooping all round
and over me, I noticed one bird settle on an egg, between two slabs
of rock at the top of the cliff, in what seemed to me rather an
unusual site for a Fulmar's nest. I watched her for some time, and
then went to look at the egg. She resented my intrusion, and only
rose when I could almost touch her with my stick. I then found
that she was sitting on a Herring Gull's egg ! There was no doubt
about it, as the egg reeked of Fulmar. She returned to it as soon
as I walked away.
I saw a pair of Whimbrels on the high ground, but had not
time to search for a nest.
There were four colonies of Arctic Terns, and many Eider
Ducks nesting; and, in addition to the cliff-breeding birds, Wheat-
ears and Starlings (nesting in the walls), Hooded Grows, Rock-pipits,
and Oyster-catchers were seen. Amongst the Terns I noticed one
in the rarely observed plumage of the year-old bird, i.e., with the
white forehead and mottled crown of head.
Leaving&amp;apos; Rona, I again visited Stack, but though the sea was
very smooth, there was far more swell than at my last visit, and
landing was out of the question. However, I steamed close round
the skerry and took another careful survey of the number of Gannets,
and was quite satisfied with my former estimate of 5000. One or
two birds were still carrying seaweed to the island.
I took the temperature of the water at 5 p.m.--52* at 10
feet, and 51* at 60 feet ; and then steamed off towards the Pentland
Firth.
Immediately after leaving the island we came across a number
of Great Shearwaters and a few Fork-tailed Petrels. The yacht's
engines were slowed down, and for two hours we were passing
amongst the Shearwaters. It was difficult to estimate their numbers,

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays ;
for though the sea had an oily surface, there was a rather heavy
swell, which hid the birds just as one detected them. Many of
them were sitting amongst the Guillemots, and, unless the white
throat was turned towards me, it was not easy to see them at a
distance. Often, however, six or eight were in sight at one moment.
As they skim over the water away from one, they look very dark
but slightly slimmer Fulmars, with a dark band across the tail and
conspicuous white upper tail-coverts. A side view reveals the white
cheeks, which seem to extend almost as a collar behind the nape.
At times we glided within thirty or forty yards of one sitting on the
water, and in bright sunlight it is seen that they are a lighter brown
than they appear on the wing. A great deal of white shows above
the water on the sides, and of course the breast, throat, and chin
are white.
The Shearwater is rather a heavy and almost duck-like bird
on the water, exclusive of the head, as the wings, which appear so
long and pointed in flight, do not reach beyond the tail.

THE WINTER TREATMENT OF

By L. Lovell-Keays, F.Z.S., &amp;c.
The Chestnut buds were bursting. To me that meant good-bye
to winter, but it is by no means a great sorrow, this parting. I
regard the winter in the same light--or is it darkness ?--that I do
the tax collector or the uninvited guest. Had I lived 2000 years ago
I should undoubtedly have raised many and expensive altars to the god
of winter in the hope of keeping him mild in temper and gentle of mien.
But in the year 1914 I thought I, at any rate, would flatter the
goddess of Fortune and defy in a tentative sort of way the god of
winter. Had not Fortune delivered into my hands some 400 birds
and some twelve or fifteen bird rooms and aviaries. Here, indeed,
was an opportunity to tempt Fortune still further, and incidentally
to justify the experts. For surely the experts ought to know!
Still it occurred to me I might link up my " Weavers' Aviary" with
the hot-water system, and I had the heating arrangements of my
Gouldian aviary and bird-rooms perfected. At the end of the

autumn I made up my mind I, at any rate, would not do one thing
and that was to allow birds to go in and out of a warmed shelter
at their own sweet will. It seemed to me that that was asking
for trouble. But I must indulge in my incorrigible habit of digress-
ing in order to bring my own line of thought in harmony with what
I am going to write.
Late last summer I was talking to our member Dr. Hopkinson,
when I made the following trite and seemingly ingenuous remark.
It was, " Do you know, I believe birds live longer and are less liable
to die in cages than in an aviary." His reply was even more trite--
" I know they do," was all he said. Ever since I became seriously
interested in aviculture I have been struck by the number of times I
have come across all sorts of birds kept in draughty cages, fed very
unscientifically in a vitiated and over-heated atmosphere, and yet
some of these birds have lived for long periods, often exceeding a
decade. Then my mind shifted automatically to the better-class
dealers who tend their birds carefully, such as Mr. John Erostick, and
I found their mortality could not be so very [high, for month after
month one saw the same birds advertised and birds that could not
be duplicated. Then with kaleidoscopic change, one's mind harked back
to one's own experiences, particularly with such bad livers as Pintail
Parrot Finches and Fire-finches, and how even they lived so long as
they were confined in a cage, but once outside the cage door they
quickly joined the immortals. Dr. Hopkinson was particularly
emphatic in his experience with Eire - finches, which coincided
exactly with mine. All this was very unpleasant to think upon
and created a feeling of evident avicultural indigestion. But facts
are stubborn things, and although they may be ignored and passed
over they insist upon rising up again and mocking you. In the
1913-14 winter I kept all my birds very carefully housed, and as
regards the small birds in a heated bird-room. My losses were not
heavy, and when at length the spring arrived I thought they had
come to an end. But they had not, and all through the summer
I had aggravating and disappointing losses. I was absolutely per-
plexed. Here were birds acclimatized and established dropping off
in mid-summer, late summer and early autumn. At length the
winter of 1914-15 approached, and the question of dealing with

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays,
one's birds became a pressing and serious matter. Roughly speak-
ing I divided my birds into three main families, viz. :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989046222222222" page_id="32670318"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
(1) Those that had access to a suitable shelter, but were not
obliged to use it by day or by night unless they liked.
(2) Those that were driven in by night and only allowed out on
suitable days.
(3) Those that were shut in, and, owing to the structure of the
bird-rooms, never allowed out at all.
Under heading No. 2 I could further sub-divide by adding
(a) Those that had the advantage of heat, if and when necessary.
( b ) No heating under any circumstances.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999398115384616" page_id="32670318"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
In section 3 heat was used whenever the thermometer stood
below 40* Fahr. or appeared likely to fall below 40* Fahr.
With 12-15 aviaries and some 400-450 birds it seemed one
had a fairly good opportunity of testing the open-air-go-in-and-out-
when-you-like theory.
The results and deductions were very soon and very easily
arrived at. The losses varied from 5 to 50 per cent. In some cases
an entire species was wiped out. And it all happened just as the
man in the street would have expected, viz., the greater the liberty
the birds had the higher the mortality. I cannot truthfully say I
have had a single surprise. I hope and think I have been absolutely
honest with myself and carried on the experiment in a truly open-
minded scientific spirit. But I think perhaps the most instructive
experiment was with regard to an aviary in category No. 1, which I
shall deal with later on. The birds there consisted of Grassfinches,
Singing Finches, Mannikins, Waxbills, and a pair of Scaly-crowned
Finches. Many of them were aviary-bred last season. I found it
quite impossible to drive these birds in at night time, so let them
take their chance. I am sure that not five per cent, used the shelter
unless they were going to die, and then I have often noticed they do.
With regard to this shelter question, how many shelters are used
voluntarily by most birds? Parrakeets will use a shelter, but I
have yet to find the birds that will use a shelter or the shelter that
most birds will use. This evening (March 25th) the birds were left
out a little late, and in one aviary where the birds had slept in the
shelter for over five months, not six out of perhaps fifty were roost-

ing inside. And yet this is the best shelter I have, and the mortality
has been almost unappreciable, about 10 per cent. In my largest
aviary, containing another 50-60 birds, the average number of in-
habitants of the shelter would for the six winter months be a fraction
of one. And this is the whole root of the evil. Birds will not roost
in the shelters. No blandishments, no coercion, will tempt them to
use the shelters regularly.* I must, after sad and bitter experience,
totally disagree with many thoughtful and accurate observers with
regard to the hardiness of foreign birds ; at any rate, as regards the
more freely imported species. It is easy to find instances where
single birds or even pairs have braved a winter and come through
safely, but isolated cases are no criterion and afford no facts of
scientific value. It is only by comparison of identical cases under
different circumstances but under the same conditions of locality
and weather that we obtain data that one can argue upon. Let me
illustrate my point. Dr. Hopkinson has been out in the Gambia
many years and has survived with but few ills. Is one to argue
from that that the other 400 odd members of the Avicultural Society
could live in the Gambia with impunity. The fact is that Dr.
Hopkinson (I hope he will forgive me for citing his name so much)
is one of the fortunate ones, and the Colonial Office forget to mention
those of its officers who have never returned. The moral is, of
course, obvious. A bird lives, and gives us joy when we see it, and
everything we have done to that bird and for that bird strikes us as
being right. But if only aviculturists would remember Pollonius'
advice to his son : " To thine own self be true, &amp;c., &amp;c." and keep
a record of their losses, I am sure their eyes would be opened, and
the rosy tint with which they paint their avicultural experiences
would give way to a mere utilitarian tint of man-o'-war grey. The
extraordinary thing is that all aviculturists (or nearly all) deny in-
dignantly that they have losses. They all (or nearly all) claim to
breed innumerable birds, very few have birds to sell,--if we except
Budgerigars, Silverbills, and such like--and yet their aviaries never
get any fuller. It is strange, passing strange, and I understand it
* n have electric light in the shelters, which is turned on all through the winter
at dusk, and the birds go in to feed and remain there. The light is left on
until about S p.m.--ED.]

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays ;
not. Personally I am still looking for the elixir of bird-life; still
seeking the key to the door of avicultural knowledge which will
banish for ever my arch-enemy Death, the invidious and crafty one.
But to return to our subject, the treatment of birds in winter.
Does it appeal to one as reasonable that birds that bask in the sun-
shine of North Africa, Brazil, India, or Australia, could thrive in
the damp, inclement, misty, benighted climate of England? We
are told that the reason Englishmen make such hardy colonists is
because of our climate. If they can stand that they can stand
anything.
I will analyse very briefly and roughly my results. I may
say that all have ample shelters except one Parrakeet aviary, in which
there is an abundance of eaves to take the place of a proper shelter.
Aviary I. Well-sheltered from N., E., and W. Open to S. and
S.W. Birds consisting of Ruficauda Pinches, Long-tailed and
Masked Grassfinches, Alario Pinches, Orange - cheeked Waxbills,
Diamond Doves, Cordon Bleus, Pire Pinches, Indigo Buntings. Scaly
Crowned Finches, Tri-coloured Parrot Pinches, Melba Pinch, Violet-
eared Waxbills, Necklace Tanagers, Lavender Pinches, Green Ava-
davats, and Red Avadavats, were allowed to go in and out at will.
Heat is provided, but, up to the time of catching the birds up, not
used. Result: Losses were three Long-tailed and two Masked Grass-
finches, both Melba Pinches, both Scaly Crowned, two out of three
Orange-cheeks, several Fire-finches (many aviary-bred), practically all
the Cordon Bleus (most of them aviary-bred), one Tri-coloured Parrot
Pinch, two Lavender Finches, tw T o Green Avadavats, three Red
Avadavats, one hen Violet-eared Waxbill, and two Necklace Tanagers,
--these last early in the autumn.
At the end of January, as I was picking up a bird nearly every
day I caught up the rest, and since then I have not had a single
death. Heat has been provided on several occasions since January.
Aviary II. Aviary rather exposed, but great abundance of
natural cover. Inclined to be damp. Birds included Waders, several
Weavers, Green Cardinals, Java Sparrows, Paradise Whydahs,Yellow
Sparrows, Cuban Pinches (12), Diamond Sparrows (a pair) Gorgetted
Thrushes, and (to-day) a few British birds.
Results: Cuban Finches entirely wiped out. Hen Green

Cardinal, one Diamond Sparrow and three or four Weavers died.
It is only fair to say that, in my opinion, most Weavers will stand
practically anything, and that the losses in Weavers was not due to
cold or damp.
Aviary III. The best protected aviary of the series. A
regular sun-trap with a lofty brick-built shelter. An ideal aviary,
except for the soil which is very sticky and badly drained. Birds
don't do very well here in consequence, I fancy. The shelter has
been heated perhaps eight or ten times this winter, but the temper-
ature never allowed to get above 45-50*. It is very easy to drive
the birds in at night as there is a large entrance high up and in the
corner to the shelter. The birds housed here were as follows;--
Two Golden-fronted Fruit-suckers, one pair Crested Cardinals and
their young, one pair of Virginian Cardinals, one pair of Cuban
Finches, half-a-dozen Weavers of sorts, eight or nine Zebra Finches,
several Mexican Bose Finches, a pair of Jacarini Finches, Zebra
Doves, Cape Doves, Orange-breasted, Pink-cheeked and Orange-
cheeked Waxbills, three Pekin Bobins, three Green Singing Finches,
a crowd of Magpie and Bronze-wing Mannikins and two cock Parson
Finches. Mention must be made of a very fine Silver-blue Tanag&amp;apos;er
and a mongrel or two, which some people glorify by the name of
" Hybrids." Truly a heterogeneous miscellany. These birds were
only let out on fine days and always shut up at night. The Jacarini
Finches were particularly expert at avoiding detection, and so were
the Bronze-wing Mannikins, Orange-breasted and Pink-cheeked
Waxbills. But, practically speaking, the Jacarinis alone were really
successful in playing truant to any extent.
My losses here were peculiar. They were the hen Jacarini,
one each of Pink-cheeked, Orange-cheeked and Orange-breasted
Waxbills, a Bronze-winged Mannikin, and a couple of Zebra Finches
which would nest in mid-winter; also the hen Cape and Zebra
Doves and one Crested Cardinal. I do not think either the Zebra
Finches, Crested Cardinal or two Doves were the result of the
winter. I consider in this aviary the losses in most cases were
due probably to old age; but the peculiar fact remains that a loss
was recorded in all the species that "played truant" and would
not go in. It is only right to say that my " aviary-boy " is un-

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays,
doubtedly a " thick-head," and after a day's work I have come home
and found the birds out long after it had turned bitterly cold. Still
the losses here, considering&amp;apos; the species, were only normal, I think,
when one considers my birds are not--like some people's--immortal.
Aviary IY. Another excellent aviary; well sheltered, well
drained, and very sunny. The shelter is as well-lighted as a green-
house, wooden-built on brick foundations. In many respects almost
superior to Aviary III., but, owing to the amount of glass in the
shelter, heat is required to maintain anything approaching a com-
fortable temperature throughout the winter. The birds here are,
many of them, delicate, and include Tire Finches, Cordon Bleus,
Gouldians, Green Avadavats, Red Avadavats, Lavender Finches,
Grey, Zebra, and Orange-cheeked Waxbills, Alario Finches, Zebra
Finches, and an odd bird or two. Early in the winter I lost two
out of eight Gouldians, just at the time I began to shut up the birds
at night, also a hen Aurora Finch, who was a "Blower." These
and a couple of Waxbills (Grey and Orange-breasted) made up the
total of my losses here. I need hardly say that the birds were
allowed to fly in and out during really fine weather, but we were
more particular than we were with Aviary No. III.
Aviary No. Y. A completely shut-in winter aviary, contain-
ing Sugar Birds (3), Yiolet Tanagers (2), Parrot Finches (4), Zos-
terops (2), Blue-breasted Waxbills (2), Flooded Siskins (4), Yiolet-
eared Waxbills (2), Black-cheeked Waxbills (3), Rainbow and Non-
pareil Buntings (l each), Chinese Painted Quail (2), Columbian
Siskin (2), Dufresnes and Sydney Waxbills (1 each), and Zos-
terops (2).
I can truthfully say that the only bird that died that was
healthy when put into the aviary was a cock Hooded Siskin. It
was the bird that attracted so much attention at the L.C.B.A. Show 7
at Westminster. It never seemed fit after the Show, and I had
knocked off Inga seed, being assured it was bad for birds. I lost
other birds in this aviary, but then birds were caught up in other
aviaries and put into this one because they were ill. However, I
will mention the losses, although they occurred within a day or two
of being put into this aviary. They were a Blue-breasted Waxbill
with deformed mandible, a cock Violet Tanager with an abscess on

the foot, a cock Nonpareil Bunting which had been taken from
another aviary in a nearly dead condition. It picked up wonderfully,
but died quite suddenly and unexpectedly about three weeks after-
wards.
Several birds have been temporarily housed there and been
completely restored to health. Eventually they have been returned
to their respective aviaries.
It would be ridiculous to include one or two birds that were
brought into this aviary in a moribund condition and died within
twelve hours. At the same time it would not be conducive to main-
taining the standard of health among its proper inmates.
I have taken just typical cases among the small birds, and
of course omitted several aviaries for one reason or the other, but
certainly not because they in any way either prove or disprove my
contentions.
I will just say a word about parrakeets. I possess a good
number, consisting of Bed-faced, Peach-faced and Black-cheeked
Love-birds ; several species of Platycercus ; one species (4 specimens)
of Psephotus ; several examples of Conures, Pa.lceornis and Brotogerys,
and the usual bevy of Budgerigars and Cockatiels. My large Parra-
keet Aviaries are easily classed for the purposes of this paper, as in
one there is a very small shelter but plenty of eaves. In this aviary
it would be absolutely impossible to drive the birds in as the small
shelter has no door nor could it contain half the birds.
The other aviary has a good shelter, can be warmed if neces-
sary, and the birds are shut in at nights and on very bad days.
In rhe first aviary were Bed Bosellas, Passerine Parrakeets
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.7445877">
(Blue-winged Lovebirds), Bedrumps, Black-cheeked Lovebirds, All-
Green, Tovi and Indian Bing-necked Parrakeets, Cactus and Half-
moon Conures. Both Bedrumps, both Passerine, the All-Green and
Tovi Parrakeets died.
In the other aviary there are Bed-faced Lovebirds (in a slip),
All-Green (six), Canary-wing and Orange-flanked Parrakeets (in a
slip), Pennant's (two), Mealy Bosella (one), Banded and Malabar
and Plumhead (three), Parrakeets, Peach-faced Lovebirds, Speckled
Conures and Passerine Parrakeets. There have been no losses here
this winter at all.

Miss E. E. Chawner,
I fear I have very greatly exceeded the limits of space that
ought to be allowed to any one contributor, and yet I feel my ex-
periments and observations are so interesting, and possibly, being all
conducted at one and the same time and place, of some value to
aviculture. I will summarize the results of my observations. They
are as follows :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964205166666667" page_id="32670324"  page_num="244" year="" vol="">
1. Foreign birds if left to their own devices will not use a shelter.
2. If not properly sheltered during the winter losses among birds
are very heavy.
3. If made to use a proper shelter during the night and bad days
one's losses are greatly lessened.
4. Heat is unnecessary for the majority of foreign birds, but is
undoubtedly an advantage especially in severe weather.
5. The heat if used should be moderate, not allowed to exceed
50* Fahr., and be kept as uniform as possible.
6. Excessive window area leads to excessive loss of heat.
7. Losses can never be entirely eliminated in any bird-family of
any size, notwithstanding any theories of treatment to the

contrary.
8. The average loss among small birds is probably at least 10 per
cent. ; among parrakeets very much less. Under good con-
ditions of course.
Once more I apologise for taking up so much valuable space,
but, Mr. Editor, it was you who tempted me. At any rate, I shall
expect one cure to my credit.

NESTING OF JARDINE'S PIGMY OWL.

By Miss E. F. Chawner.
Early in the summer of last year, the Editor of the Avicitl-
tural Magazine wrote to me offering for sale a true pair of the
rare South American Jardine's Pigmy Owl (Glaucidium jardinii).
Needless to say I secured them at once.
These tiny Owls are my especial weakness, and I had never
even seen this species, much less owned a pair. They arrived in
perfect condition, and from that day to this have enjoyed excellent

health and the best of appetites. Their size is about that of the
Sparrow Owl, but they are taller and slimmer and less "round
about." Their colouring is brighter, rufous-brown on the back and
white streaked with chestnut in front. The sexes are alike. They
twitch their tails from side to side when excited and are extremely
quick and active in their movements.
My pair is remarkably silent; in fact, I have never heard
them utter any sound whatever. They are not particular as to diet
and eat sparrows, kittens, young rabbits, and mice, indiscriminately,
though they certainly prefer the last named.
About the middle of March I hung up a nesting-box for them
and furnished it with a layer of rotten wood; they soon took to it
and spent much time going in and out of it. By the 12th of April
the hen retired to a corner of the box and settled down to incubate
her clutch of three eggs. They are of the usual type, round and
white, rather large for the size of the bird. She sat very closely
and her mate guarded her with great devotion, flying fiercely at
intruders and doing all he could to drive them away.
On May 8th the first egg shells were thrown out and a young
bird could be heard twittering. Both parents remained in the nest-
box, the cock only leaving to fetch up provisions. Another nestling
appeared on the 9th and the third on the 11th.
They are tiny creatures, covered with snowy white down, and
unlike their parents are very vociferous. The first few days of their
existence they are continually brooded by their mother, but after-
wards can plainly be seen squatting beside her in the box. How
they manage to retain their whiteness is a puzzle, for all food is
carried up by the cock and lies about on the floor until consumed.
Mice and kittens are accepted as suitable food for the babies, but I
am rather surprised to find that small chickens and even a young
Thrush, which a Rook had killed and which I thought would be just
the thing, are consistently refused. Sparrows are readily accepted.
The Owlets grow rapidly and are active; they appear to be
thriving and I hope presently to report that they have been success-
fully reared .*
* [Miss Chawner is to be congratulated. This is undoubtedly the first time that
Jardine's Glaucidium has been bred in England.--ED.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
The answer to this question is, I think, that they are so when
they have an object in view ; but not otherwise. Thus we know
from many recorded and well authenticated instances, as well as
from personal experience when we have tramped the country with
our eyes open, that many birds will pretend to be crippled if one
approaches their nests or young, or will dive into bushes or shrubs
at some distance from the nest (passing quietly out on the other side)
in order to deceive one as to its location.
In like manner a malicious or predacious bird will sit sleepily
upon a branch until some weak and unsuspecting species settles
within its reach when it will suddenly pounce upon it. As I have
elsewhere recorded, I had several unpleasant proofs of this in the
case of a Rose-headed Parrakeet which successively killed a Whin-
chat, Stonechat, and Skylark in this sly manner: in the case of the
last-mentioned the parrakeet may have been scandalized to see a
Skylark sitting on a branch, though I have frequently seen another
example which I kept in a different aviary sitting on a branch in
the daytime: at night it always roosted on the earth.
When, however, it is confidently asserted that birds deliber-
ately disguise their nests with lichen, moss, bits of paper, &amp;c., in
order to render them inconspicuous, I am satisfied that those who
make such assertions cannot have had much experience in searching
for nests. It is quite true that such materials attached to the
outside walls of nests do render them frequently less conspicuous
than they would be otherwise, but they are not utilized by the
builders with the object of deceiving, but because they are readily
obtainable and perhaps appeal to the bird's aesthetic taste.
Nothing could be more conspicuous than the nest of a Long-
tailed Tit or a Chaffinch covered with whitish lichen and stuck in
the outside twigs of a roadside hedge : such nests are irresistible
temptations to the mischievous ck^lhopper and are pretty certain to
be torn out and pulled to pieces ; yet no end of fairy-tales have been
told of the ingenuity of these and other birds in disguising their nests
by such adornments. I believe one eager exponent of the well-
known fact of protective assimilation mentioned having seen a

Chaffinch nest in a flowering fruit-tree which was clotted over with
pieces of white paper in order to make it look like a cluster of
blossom : unfortunately the genuine bloom would soon fade and drop
away rendering the supposed disguise utterly futile.
Of course many birds do try to hide their nests, and I even
on one occasion had that of the Skylark pointed out to me concealed
by a piece of tangled water-weed loosely attached to one side, so that
it fell over the eggs and hid them from sight when the mother was
from home : the presence of this water-weed at some distance from a
dyke caused me to stoop and examine it closely and thus I discovered
the eggs : whether this was a wilful attempt to deceive on the part
of the bird may be open to question.
As a rule, when a bird is anxious to conceal its nest, it places
it in thick scrub, in dense undergrowth, among ivy or other close-
growing creepers, or in a hole in a tree, bank, or wall; it does not
artistically examine the surroundings and attempt to imitate them
accurately. A Wren may decide to build its nest in a mass of moss
overhanging a bank, and naturally uses the available material (which
it has pulled out from the centre) in covering the outside of the nest;
or if it builds in a mass of fallen and dead leaves in the midst of a
bramble, it also uses the materials which are at hand ; but although
this renders the nest inconspicuous, I do not for a moment believe
that the little architect is aware of the fact.
Many insects invariably settle for rest upon objects which
best conceal them and are so well hidden that it requires either an
entomologist or a hungry bird to discover them ; but it need not
therefore be assumed that everything which is difficult to distinguish
from its surroundings must necessarily be designed for concealment.
It must also be remembered that man is not the only animal
against which birds would desire to protect themselves ; and when
one considers that, in the case of birds which build open nests
above the ground, the eggs are usually more or less conspicuously
coloured, the advantage gained by a deceptive nest is greatly reduced.
Perhaps this is why natural selection has not made the artificial con-
cealment of nests by external ornamentation a rule: the advantage
gained is so uncertain that the necessity for it has not been impressed
upon the minds of birds and therefore has not become instinctive.

Are Birds Deceitful ?
Eggs deposited in nests on or in the ground, or among pebbles
or ground litter, are usually mimetic in colouring and extremely
difficult to distinguish from their surroundings; but unhappily they
are more liable than those built higher up to destruction by stoats
and other ground-frequenting vermin.
It is extraordinaay how men who become obsessed with a
theory will try to strain every known fact into its service. The fact
that the egg of our common Cuckoo not infrequently resembles the eggs
of its foster-mother is assumed to be with the object of deceiving
her ; but when we know that by far the greater number of Cuckoo's
eggs in no wise resemble the eggs among which they are deposited,
this notion at once disproves itself. Nobody really knows why some
Cuckoo's eggs are such admirable copies of those with which they
are placed, but it has been suggested that if a Cuckoo is reared by a
Hedge-Sparrow or any other bird, she will probably lay in the nest
of that bird, and that similar feeding for many successive generations
may affect the colouring of the eggs. I don't know; and that is
about as far as most of us will ever get in explaining many of
Nature's secrets : and if the truth is ever revealed, we shall discover
that many of the explanations suggested are miles away from it.
Doubtless many of our members have observed, as I fre-
quently have done, that, after a flight many birds did not return in
a straight line to their nests : a Blackbird or Thrush, if its home is
situated in ivy or thick scrub on one side of a wall or fence, usually
flies straight over in a straight line past its nest, and at a little
distance beyond it and then turns and slips quietly back under cover.
A Lark descending from an aerial flight alights on the ground at a
fair distance from its nest and wanders, apparently in an aimless
fashion, among the herbage with many turns and twists, but always
approaching more closely to its objective until within about a foot
of it, and then attains it at a run : doubtless the object is to deceive
the watcher; but probably this habit has become instinctive and
the deception is unconscious, just as dogs descended from a wolf
stock approach their masters in a wide half circle, as Darwin points
out and as I have repeatedly noticed: the original purpose pre-
sumably was to avoid a frontal attack from an adversary.

By M. Portal.
According to Sandford, in his book " The Waterfowl Family,"
this Teal has a very wide range for breeding, extending from Maine
to B. Columbia, probably Texas, Mexico, and north to Labrador.
He reports it as rare on the Pacific Coast.
Although the breeding range is considerable, he remarks that
the birds are in no way partial to cold weather and " hurry along at
the first frosts." It breeds most abundantly on the Northern Prairies
of U.S.A. and in Manitoba. This being the case, it seems to be a
great pity we cannot get more hand-reared birds in England, as
without doubt the Blue-wing is one of the nicest of all the Teals and
gets very tame.
With reference to frost, I notice that it does not mind it, as
long as it has shelter from the wind. My pond--which is quite one of
the worst imaginable for any waterfowl--stands 570 feet up, and in
Northumberland, which is not famed for warmth or mild winters.
I have had Blue-wing Teal here now for three years, having been
given a pair by a kind friend as a start and reputed " hand-reared,"
and they nest each year, but so far malignant fate always spoils the
nest before I lift the eggs, usually a rat has been the culprit, but once
my foot was : as I trod on it. The nest is always well hidden and in
and under a tuft of grass, and the female covers it up most carefully
when she leaves it. To me it is always a source of uncertainty when
to lift a nest found with five or six eggs in. You knoiv she will lay
probably nine or ten before she begins to sit, and you hope the odd
dozen vermin traps you have got set about the pond will catch any rat
before he finds her nest--and being naturally anxious for a full
clutch you chance it--and fail.
So far I have only reared one young one from a dropped egg,
and he got hurt by the hen at three weeks and pined. Up to that
time there was little difference in it from common Teal, and, until
hurt, fed well on ordinary duck meal, egg, duck weed and bread
crumbs.
Personally, I think that to be really successful with Teal,

Notes on the Blue-wing Teal.
one should have a pond for Teal and Teal alone, and on it I
would have 1 Blue-wing Teal, 2 Cinnamon Teal, 3 Bing-necked
Teal, 4 Common Teal, 5 Versicolor Teal, 6 American Green-wing
Teal, 7 Chili Teal and Cotton Teal if you can get them. I
would exclude without doubt any of the larger variety of Teal,
such as Brazil Teal who are nasty cross birds in breeding time.
I am certain that the mixture of large surface feeding ducks and
small ones is a mistake at nesting-time, and only tends to upset the
peace of the pond (unless very large) and reduces the breeding
chances. I have included Chili Teal in my list of nice Teal, but
at the same time they are the worst tempered of all the Teal in
spring time; however, they are small birds.
The plumage of female Blue-wing is dull always and is very
similar to the Cinnamon female. The male, on the other hand,
w hen he is in full plumage, is one of the most lovely of all the
Teal who have an eclipse plumage. In full Spring dress his head is
a sort of " plumbaceous " grey : a good broad white crescent in front
of eyes ; breast and flanks speckled reddish buff, a sort of pink-red
colour; pale blue wing-coverts ; back darkish-brown, a very white
patch on each side of tail; the bill is lead black, and feet and legs
a yellowish colour.
In courting, the male raises his head up and down, at much
the same angle as a Shoveller, and gives a sort of tliree-note call, but
only when swimming with or near the female, who responds by a
bob of the head or a hoarse croak.
About the middle of June, the male starts to go into a
complete moult of plumage, and it comes on very fast. Quoting
from notes made in 1913 :--
On June 16.--Still full plumage.
, 20.--Started on flanks and by white tail spots.
J} 26.--Fast change on flanks and breast.
n 29.--White tail patch now half brown and large brown
mottled feathers in flanks and the usual white
crescent on head now dusky white ; sides of head now
dull brown ; black under tail now brown colour.
On July 4.--Change complete ; hard to distinguish male from female
at first sight. No call.

I find all Teal are fond of unhusked rice--known in the trade
as " Paddy Bice" I believe--and they thrive on it with some wheat
and a little barley. They are also fond of worms, machine-minced
rabbit [raw], soaked dog biscuit or Spratt's " Crissell," but fondest
of all of water-cress and water-weed, pulled out by the roots from
a ditch with all the insects in it and put in shallow end of pond in
early Spring.
Later in May-June you can skim duck-weed off some pond
and throw it on, the more the better; or, failing duck-weed, then
young lettuce thinnings. In the winter, old Brussel Sprout plants,
tied on the edge of pond so that they are an inch in water, are
esteemed.
Personally I feel convinced that if anyone kept these Teal in
the West of England, where Spring is early and therefore more grass
and nesting covert in April, they would be certain to breed freely, as
would the other rarer Teal.
In conclusion, if you write to a dealer abroad for Blue-wing
Teal you get Cinnamon Teal sent at once, unless you quote the
Latin name and add American Blue-wing Teal; also sometimes a
Blue-wing x Cinnamon is sent by mistake.
THE BIRD MARKET OF CARACAS.
By Albert Pam.
Bight in the centre of the City of Caracas is situated the
41 Mercado " (market), where every morning all the cooks of the
town meet to purchase provisions of every kind, and almost more
important, to chat and discuss the latest scandal; Martinique
negresses, as black as soot, with gaily coloured turbans, and native
women of every gradation of complexion to pure white. Adjoining
the market is an open space of about 100 square yards, surrounded
by palms and tropical trees and paved with patterned tiles. On
weekdays this space is deserted, but on Sundays and Beast Days
(of which there are many in the Venezuelan calendar) it is trans-
formed into the " bird " market. Then the paving is covered by
men and boys of all ages, squatting next to a cage--men from all

Mr. Albert Pam,
parts of the country--pure Indians, negroes, mulattos and whites,
each with a bird or birds to sell. There are birds of all sizes and
all colours, from Humming Birds to birds of prey, from Canaries to
Parrots and Curassows. It is a mystery who buys or wants to
buy any of this assortment, as it always seemed that, apart from
Canaries--for which there appears to be a ready market--my
brother and I were the only purchasers. Most of the sellers were
"peons," i.e., labourers, who had come to spend the Sunday or
"fiesta " in Caracas, and had brought birds, caught during the week,
to sell and thus help to pay expenses. But there are two regular
bird dealers, an Italian and a native half-caste; the former
specializes in Canaries : the latter deals in anything he can pick up.
The birds are brought into the market in small wicker cages, some
of which are so full that the birds can hardly move ; but Parrots
mostly stroll about, sometimes attached to a stick by one leg,
sometimes on the seller's shoulder, and sometimes quite loose, and
it is a usual thing for one to escape or climb up a tree unobserved--
a great deal of shouting, stone-throwing, and the use of long canes
is necessary before the truant is recaptured. Sometimes a small
Pinch or Tanager, locally worth perhaps a farthing, escapes from a
cage, and then all the small half-naked urchins of the neighbourhood
flock round and shout while the owner tries to approach the bird
with a long stick covered at the point with bird lime. Also loose,
and tied to a tree stump by a string round one leg, can be seen
Guans, Curassows, Sun Bitterns, Screamers, Ducks, and on rare
occasions an Orinoco Goose. The sellers, cages and loose birds
absolutely cover the ground, and it is with the greatest difficulty
that a visitor can pick his way through on a busy day without the
fear of treading on something. The assortment in each cage is as
varied as the whole collection, Humming Birds with Pinches, Doves,
Thrushes and Tanagers, all mixed up regardless of size--but as most
of the birds are freshly caught, they are too wild to trouble about
doing each other any harm. But the natives have found* that
Hang-nests are dangerous neighbours, and mostly keep these in cages
by themselves.
Most, if not all, cages are provided with food and water for
the birds, seed for the Pinches and bananas for the others;

Humming Birds are given a solution of "papelon" (molasses sugar),
on which they appear to be able to subsist for several days. The
natives are kind to their animals in a general way, and although the
condition of the cages would shock some Members of the Avicultural
Society, the birds are really considered as far as the limited intellect
of the uneducated peon allows ; the cages are covered with banana
leaves in the hot sun or transferred to a shady spot, and the birds
are never left without food and water for any length of time.
The Venezuelan&amp;apos;s only requirement of a cage bird is that it
should sing--sing loudly and constantly all day long ; they never
understand why anyone should buy a bird that does not sing.
Their first recommendation of any bird they offered us for sale was
" it sings very well," regardless of the species. They have told us
this of Turkey Buzzards, Guans and birds of prey, thinking that
this would induce us to buy, and on our expressing any doubt as to
the sweetness of the song, affirmed loudly that in a few days when
the bird had settled down, we should be able to judge that they
were truthful!
The individual value of the birds would be considered low by
our Members--and after we had bought experience rather dearly,
we got to know the real market value of most kinds. Most Tanagers
and Finches can be bought for 1 franc, or less, the rarer kinds cost
2 to 5 francs, Hang-nests about 2 to 3 francs, unless very tame,
when the price is up to 10 francs, all Thrushes about 2 francs,
Guans 3 to 4 francs, Humming Birds from 1 to 2 francs, and larger
birds up to 10 francs. But the price depends on the supply and
season of the year, and as to whether one is prepared to buy a
whole cage-full rather than pick and choose the birds one really
w T ants. This latter system is by far the cheapest, but one is apt to
acquire more birds than one can do with, and thus easily become
overstocked. On the other hand, if one picked out a specially rare
bird out of a cage containing 20 others, the price for the one would
probably be higher than that of all, as the Venezuelan peon is a
very shrewd business man, and would always charge very highly
for any bird he thought we wanted badly.
Many a happy hour have I spent in the Bird Market, some-
times finding nothing of special interest, sometimes buying a dozen

or twenty birds ; the cages containing these had then to be sent up to
my house, and I would like to mention in regard to this, the absolute
honesty of the Venezuelan peon, boy or man. We simply handed
the cages containing valuable birds to any boy or man standing
about, told him where to take them, and did not trouble further
until he arrived at the house with the birds. These peons, although
very poor and quite uneducated, do not know what dishonesty is,
and can be trusted with anything valuable--gold, silver, coins, no
matter what; they never fail to account for whatever has been
entrusted to them, and I think that this delightful feature in their
character is one that calls for special notice, as it is quite unique
and contrary to what is generally supposed to be the case by people
who do not know Venezuela.
Caracas lies 3,000 feet above sea level in a wide, fertile and
sub-tropical valley, and is only about 6 miles from the coast as the
crow flies. The valley is surrounded by hills beyond which are other
valleys, some hotter, some cooler, and within comparatively short
distances from the Capital are hot, low-lying plains, while the higher
elevations have a temperate climate, with very cold nights. It is
thus clear that the variety of birds from the immediate neighbour-
hood of Caracas is very great, and although I know South America
from North to South and from East to West, no place that I know
of is a better centre for a bird collector than the Capital of Venezuela.
It will be some indication of this when I say that my brother and I
have brought home to the Zoological Society in only 7 shipments
altogether 130 species of birds, and if those that died on the way
home, or the rarer ones which died before they were sent off, and
those that we saw wild but could not catch and were not offered in
the market--were added, the numbers would be enormously
increased. Sometimes birds had to be kept by us for 6 months or
more out there, before they could be taken home, and it is unavoid-
able that many should die during this time. The commbn ones
could always be replaced, but the rare birds seldom came into the
market, and when one died, its loss was serious.
It would be of little interest to give a complete list of the
birds we collected and sent home from Caracas, but the following
will give some idea of the variety of those which arrived. The

JOTTINGS ON COMMON INDIAN BIRDS.

(Concluded from page 218 ).
Those who have seen Mr. Stuart Baker's book will see how
many and varied are the Pigeons and Doves of India; but easy
as we find it to identify all our birds of this Order on the wing, it is
a very different matter when it is a case of birds with which one is
not familiar, and both Pigeons and Doves are far more often noticed
when flying than when at rest. I think the Green Pigeon seen so
often in Ceylon, when it will fly in front of a motor car, often settling
and then rising again as the car gets nearer, is the Southern Green
Pigeon (Crocopus chlorog aster), and the one that behaved in exactly
the same way in front of my pony in Sikham may perhaps have
been the Bengal Green Pigeon ( C. plncenicopterus), though Sikhim
seems rather high for its range as given by Blanford. The Indian
Blue Eock-Pigeon (Columba intermedia) was to be seen in every
place visited in India proper. In Eajputana it really swarms and
no one ever touches it ; one sees it in the towns and in great flocks
close to the fields. A delightful and confiding bird in gardens and
generally about towns and villages is the Little Brown Dove ( Turtur
cambay ensis).
A neighbour of mine has a Peacock (I, too, would have one
also, or several, if they would leave my flowers alone) and his voice
comes over the hanger, across the meadow land, and up to our hill.

Mr. Aubyn Trevok-Battye
I like to hear it as I sit in my study writing, and it brings back
memories of a beautiful old walled and moated Kentish garden
where they kept thirty-nine. (There was wire netting round the
beds.) It seemed strange to hear that familiar call in the jungle of
Nepal, and it required little effort of the fancy to be back in my chair
at home, or in that sleepy ancient garden with the sun upon the
hollyhocks and the lizards darting into the crannies of the walls.
The Peacock is the national emblem of Nepal. But to see Peacocks
in their numbers you must go into Rajputana, for the bird is sacred
there. There are flocks of them about the fields as one passes in the
train.
Jungle Fowl ought to be domestic, sometimes they pretend to
be. I remember passing very early one morning through a sleeping
Sinhalese village, and as I passed the outskirts poultry were searching
a heap of straw dropped in the middle of the road. They were a
mixed lot, and I did not pay much attention to them ; one or two looked
like " Indian Game." But as I came up three ran off and on reach-
ing the ditch at the roadside spread their wings and flew into the
jungle. They were the Ceylon Jungle-Fowl (Galius lafayettii), only
found in Ceylon. The other fowls went on with their scratching.
One is constantly seeing Jungle-Fowl in Ceylon, and a cock, when
the sun shines on him, is a beautiful sight in his gold and red. These
birds are shy rather than wild, and if you follow them into the
jungle, though they usually run, will sometimes fly up on to a branch
and look at you. I saw very little of Jungle-Fowl in India. There
are two, the Red Jungle-Fowl (Gallus ferrugineus) and Sonnerat's
Jungle-Fowl (G. sonnerati ). (We have them in the Zoo, but not, I
think, the Sinhalese bird). I only saw the former and I saw them,
I think, but three times. One day I was walking up the road from
Khalsi to Chakrata and came to a corner where the road turned
sharply to the right. On that hand was the wall and the descent,
while on the left hand was the steep rocky jungle. Just at this
point a hollow sloped down to the road. As I turned the corner I
came right upon two Jungle-Fowl and two Cheer Pheasants who
were busily engaged in hollowing out some root like a mangold wurzel,
fallen from a cart in the road. They fled up the hollow and dis-
persed, the Jungle Fowl running&amp;apos; with wings open, the Pheasants

running at first and then skimming into the scrub. The Cheer
Pheasant ( Gatreus wallichi) is found chiefly in the high mountains
(6,000 to 7,000 ft., Blanford) so this was rather low for them. A
little further on the same day a Cheer Pheasant cock ran along the
road by the cart in which I was seated and made several attempts
to fly up the wall and into the scrub before it succeeded in doing so.
I do not recollect seeing any other kind of Pheasants wild ; but the
Maharaja of Nepal has in his aviaries at Khatmandu a fine lot of
Monal and Kalij Pheasants and Tragopans. The Kalij are of the
black-crested Nepal species (Gennceus leucomelanus). Though one
does not often see the Chukor (Caccabis chukor), excepting in cages,
one often hears them calling in the evening. When shooting in the
early morning in the Nepal Terai my elephant put up not infrequently
a Common Francolin which would fly a little way and then drop
into the bush, but however carefully I marked down the bird I never
got it to rise a second time. It was just the right sort of country for
them--short scrub, grasses and small streams ; we never saw them
in the tree jungle.
The Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus ) and the Coot ( Fulica atra)
were both seen. I saw neither the Common Crane ( Grus grus )
nor the Demoiselle ( Anthropoides Virgo ) on the ground, but an
immense number of the latter were seen one day circling round in
the air, and a V seen very high up in the air near Chakrata was
probably composed of the former. I saw a good deal of the Sarus
Crane ( Grus antigone ), and it was always a joy to me.
I remember particularly a certain evening in January when
lying up for Geese. It was in Rajputana, and a fuller account of the
jhil will be given when we come to the Geese. The Cranes kept
coming in in pairs. They came from all directions; some from
behind one where the sky was relatively dull, and against it they
looked white, some out of the coloured sky in front, when they
looked quite dark. Some came in quite low, those that came in
from greater distances were high up, but circled round getting lower
and lower until they set their wings and skimmed down on a
gradual slant, and throwing forward their long legs lit in the
shallow water or upon the mud. They were quite unsuspicious ; I
was hidden, but very imperfectly hidden, behind two barley sheaves

Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye
stuck up on end. A pair but a few yards in front of me must have
seen me--for their eyes are sharp enough--but they only looked up
now and then, occupying themselves in splashing and in moving
their bills about in the water. I do not remember counting the
number of Cranes at that jhil, there were doubtless many more in
the distance that I could not see, but perhaps there were ten pairs
within sight at once. They were all quiet for quite a long time.
Then one of my pair suddenly opened its wings and lowering its
head made a feint at its partner. Then it began dancing about her,
and the other Cranes in different places began doing the same thing.
About a hundred yards away on my left there was a wide open space
among the reeds. One of the distant pairs got up and flew to this
spot. Then mine left, and then other pairs. They went off to this
playing ground and there they all went mad. I was not near enough
to see the details of the performance, from where I was sitting it was
all a confusion of waving wings and most extraordinary noises.
Few birds are more beautiful than the JaSanas. There are two,
the Bronze-winged Ja&lt;jan4 ( Metopidius indicus) and the Pheasant-
tailed Jagana ( Hydrophasianus cliirurgus) . I have only seen the latter
in Ceylon. (I am afraid I always used to call the birds Jacanas--a
dreadful mistake, for the hook shows the accent on the last syllable
and a sedilla under the c.) They have, as everyone knows, very long
toes and long claws ; the claw on the hind toe is relatively as long as
the hind claw of the Lark, but is bent the other way. Not only
can they run over water-lily leaves (the Moorhen can do that
much) but just as the reindeer by pressing the moss together under
its wide and hollow hooves, pass over soft bog that would engulf a
cow, so the Jacanas can walk where the water seems to be clear ;
their speed of foot being sufficient to support them on the weed-
mass that is just hidden below the surface.
The first bird noticed in the family of the " Plovers," is the
Bed-wattled Lapwing ( Sarcogrammus indicus ). Wherever one goes
and there is damp ground, one sees one or more of these gay-decked
birds ; the bright colour of the wattle, the black and white of the
head and neck, and even the yellow legs make the bird very con-
spicuous. The Yellow 7 -wattled Lapwing ( Sarciophorus malabaricus)
frequents drier ground and is not so often seen, though I saw it

several times in Ceylon. The Black-winged Stilt ( Himanotopus
Candidas) is quite common in the marshes and by the edges of jhils ;
one sees flocks which must sometimes number many hundreds.
I do not intend to go into details of all the Waders seen, but
must first mention this curious little happening : that one evening
as Mr. Elwes and I were sitting on the verandah of the dak
bungalow at Chakrata a Woodcock alighted on the gravel at the foot
of the bungalow steps. A bird that was quite new to me was the
Wood-Snipe ( Gallinago nemoricola). I never saw one alive, but Mr.
Bhys Williams shot one in the Nepal Terai, and I skinned it for
him. He said it got up in some cover. It is very like the Common
Snipe {G. coslestis) but is larger, and is without the rakish look of our
sporting bird.
The Little Cormorant ( Phalacrocorax javanicus ) as also the
Darter ( Plotus melanogaster) , was often seen. From the train one
evening we saw an immense congregation of Little Cormorants pre-
paring to roost. There had been a break in a dam and much of the
country was flooded, and all along by the side of the line was a vast
collection of birds, among them Glossy Ibis ( Plegadis falcinellus) , here
and there a White Ibis ( Ibis melanocephala) , and of course many
Herons and Egrets. Curiously enough I cannot remember seeing
any Common Storks, but in the Nepal Terai the White-necked Stork
(Dissura episcopus) was often seen. From observation of it there
I should have said that it was far more of a wood than a plain bird,
I do not, of course, mean that I ever saw it in a real forest, but it was
always in pairs round about the jungle. It had a most beautiful eye.
The name of the Painted Stork ( Pseudotantalus leucocephalus)
reminds me of a most delightful morning spent on the lake in
Udaipur. Udaipur is one of the four original states of Bajputana,
and is now, I suppose, the most mediaeval state in Upper India. Its
immense granite and marble palace hangs on a ridge above the lake
to which its 100 ft. walls descend. (You may see--I did--three or four
hundred wild swine come in from the jungle every evening to feed
on maize thrown down for their supper). There are islands in the
lake with white marble building&amp;apos;s on them ; it is all very beautiful.
Unfortunately this lovely lake bids fair to become choked with a fast-
spreading weed which has got into it. We ran the boat ashore on

an island and got out and explored. It was a breeding place of the
Painted Storks, and, though the nesting season was apparently over,
many were sitting in the old nests as well as all about on the trees
and on the ground. They were in two states of plumage, the brown
of the immature birds and the pure white and pink of the old one.
The legs are very noticeable as they are a rosy flesh colour while
the long curved bill and the forehead are buttercup colour. Beautiful
as the birds looked on the trees they were still more striking when
they rose and flew round above the water ; for then one had the
contrast of the shining black wings.
Every now and then when passing near wet tracts of ground
one sees the splendid Large Egret (Herodias alba), a brilliant white
streak against the dark marsh. But a far commoner bird is the
Small Egret (Heroclias garzetta), which often associates with " Paddy-
birds " in the rice (or padhi) fields. In winter it would be impossible
at a distance to distinguish this from a smaller ally the Cattle Egret
(Bubulcus coromandus) which then is also white. I remember one
winter evening, in Ceylon, standing on the great band (dam) of the tank
of Kantalai, watching Pheasant-tailed Jaganas. The water, I suppose,
was low, for a great number of crocodiles had collected near the band.
There was relatively little open water but a great stretch of marsh
and weeds. A good many White Egrets were scattered about, and
at first I did not discover that each was standing on a buffalo, for
the buffaloes were nearly or entirely submerged. When a buffalo
rolled over the Cattle Egrets would try to do just what the juggler
does when he walks on a rolling barrel. Sometimes they succeeded,
but often they had to open their wings or even to get down altogether
till the rolling was finished.
What would India be without its Paddy-birds ! The Pond
Heron (Ardeola grayi ) is a friend of every day, and often as not
is a surprise and very invisible -- it can stand so still. Then up it
gets and seems to be quite another bird, for then its white wings
and its white tail and body show sharply against the mud ; then it
drops and is again invisible.
In speaking of the Sarus Crane we have mentioned a jhil in
Rajputana. To be precise it was Kafasin, south of Udaipur. We
will now come back to the same jhil as our path has brought us

to the Geese. Without pretending to give the names of all the birds
there were on or by the jhil, the following were certainly there.
Grey-lag Geese (Anser ferns), Bar-headed Geese ( A.indicus ), Spotted
Duck (Anas pcecilorhyncha) , Shoveler ( Spatula clypeata), Cotton
Teal ( Nettopus coromandelianus) , Common Teal (Nettion crecca),
Gargany Teal (Querquedula circia) and other Ducks not identified.
Then there were Snipe ( Gallinago ccelestis), Bed-wattled Lapwing
(Sarcogrammus indicus), Black-winged Stilts (. Himantopus candidus\
various small Waders, Great White Egret (. Herodias alba), smaller
Egrets (either H. intermedia or H. garzetta), Glossy Ibis ( Plegadis
falcinellus) , and a rather larger Ibis dark in colour, " with a red head "
(my notes). This bird I took to be the Black Ibis (Inocotis papillosus ).
There were in reality many more kinds of birds than these, but it
was a big jhil. It is the morning of the day on which we saw the
Sarus Cranes.
We were three guns : a cousin, his wife and myself ; we had
shot-guns, but the lady had her rifle, and with this she was a practised
shot. My cousin, who was journeying on an annual inspection, was
in camp by this jhil with his family, and with thirty camels, beside
horses, cattle and tents (like Abraham), travelling from Udaipur. I
joined him at about 11 o'clock on a hot morning. It was the 28th of
January. " The jhil is about 1,000 yards long perhaps, and about of the
same width ; shallow for a considerable distance out, but deep in the
middle and by the band at the further end, and full of crocodiles.
At the upper end is a strip of cultivated land with scant crops of
barley, and their deep reed-beds." I ought to have said before that
this place lies in a stony desert. (I had been interested to notice,
by the way, that the camel that carried my luggage was able with
the greatest ease to trot right away from the pair of fast ponies of
the tonga in which I was seated).
The Geese which were the object of our attentions were out
in the middle of the jhil; I could not estimate their numbers--
perhaps there were five hundred Grey-lags and two hundred
Bar-headed. The two other guns went round to the further side while
I was taken by two natives into the reed-beds. After a walk and a
wade we came to the last fringe of reeds, beyond which there was a
stretch of mud and creeks, and then the open water of the jhil. It

was very hot in the reeds, but I had a delightful time watching the
birds. There were three Common Snipe on the mud close to me,
and, as they had no idea I was peeping at them through the reeds,
thev went on feeding quite calmly, sticking their bills into the mud
and turning over little bits of dead rush. There were Ducks also
and Teal on the mud and in the water near it--but as this story may
easily grow too long I must keep to the Geese. Well, we failed
altogether with the Geese. Natives walked into the water as
far as they dared, making a great splashing, the rifle was fired,
but the jhil was too large ; all the Geese did was to get up with a
clamour of voices and roar of wings and settle again more in the
middle than ever. This went on for quite a long time, and seeing it
was hopeless I started round outside the reed beds to look out
for Snipe on the grass, but all the wet places were dry, so to
say. The grass sloped up to a road by a village, and on the
slope women were washing clothes ; standing by them and pulling
at the grass was a flock of five Geese as tame as Geese could be. What
was my astonishment as I got nearer to see that they were all Bar-
headed Geese ! As I walked quietly towards them, they put up their
heads uneasily, but allowed me to get within, say, forty yards, when
they rose up and flew for the lake, crossing me at about the same
distance. I got one. Wild Geese know they are safe from natives,
and, which is more curious, the next morning my cousin's little boy
(aged seven ?) walked right through the flock as they were on the grass,
and had to " hurroosh " them out of his way. That evening I got
one Grey-lag by lying up behind a barley sheaf.
Without giving the names of all the Ducks seen in India,
most of which are known to us as ornamental waterfowl, I may just
mention two. They were new to me, though the first will be well
enough known to many of our readers and is certainly so to the
Editor who has a collection of them at his beautiful home in
Herefordshire. This is the Cotton Teal ( Nettopus coromandelianus).
I first saw it in Ceylon in the sort of water where one would expect
to find the Whistling Teal {Dendrocygna javanica), indeed there was
one of these birds sitting at the same time on a bough of a fallen and
half-submerged tree. I saw it from the road. I was peeping
through a hedge when I saw at some distance a little bird swimming

that in contrast with the Whistling Duck looked even smaller than
it really is. The dark surroundings of trees and grasses showed up
the white very brightly. And I remember thinking to myself,
" Can I be looking at an out-of-plumage Smew?' - This confession
brings us to the end of these jottings with the Falcated Teal
(.Eunetta falcata). At one end of the maidan in the city of
Khatmandu in Nepal is a large stone-sided tank. In the middle is
a pretty little temple. There was always a flock of wildfowl on
this tank. Mallard, Shoveler, Pintail, and Teal formed the greater
proportion of the birds, but there was also a Scaup, and one bird
that, with the aid of my glasses, I puzzled over for some time. It
was a male bird of this species.
It may seem curious that a paper about birds seen in India
should deal so largely with species familiar in Britain or at any
rate in palsearctic lands ; it will be disappointing to find no account,
for example, of lovely Sun-birds or of Flower-peckers nor of others
that one associates in one's mind with a "tropical" land. There
are several reasons for this. If we except a few of Ceylon, all those
birds here described were seen north of a line drawn from Bombay
to Calcutta; again, the season was winter, when many " half-
hardy " birds go South ; and further, a majority of the most gorgeous
birds are yet the least noticeable in the dense foliage they often
frequent, and demand more time and patient watching than is
possible on a flying visit, when one is almost daily travelling on.
OBITUARY.
We greatly regret to have to record another loss in our roll of
members, a victim of the war. Lieutenant ROWLAND E. NAYLOK,
1st Royal Welsh Fusiliers (killed in action on May 17), was the son
of Mrs. John Naylor, Marrington Hall, Welshpool, and Elmwood,
Wootton, Liverpool. Lieut. Naylor, who was twenty-one, was
educated at Eton and Sandhurst. He obtained his commission in
August and went out in September. Wounded by shrapnel in
October he returned to the front in January. An all-round cricketer,
he was wicket-keeper for the Eton Eleven and twice played at Lord's
against Harrow. His three brothers are in the Service.

A LETTER TO THE EDITOR FROM THE LATE LORD BRABOURNE
ON HUMMING BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98845788372093" page_id="32670350"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
DEAR Mr. ASTLEY,--I have two or three letters of yours to answer.
I was interested to hear about those Humming Birds and hope they are still
doing well.
I am very sceptical as to my ability to bring any home successfully, also
as to bird-lime being the best means of capture. Could you not find out how
Count de Segur's were actually caught ? Where I was up north, a Humming
Bird (Amcizilia Amazali) used to fly into my room frequently about twice a week,
and the silly thing used to bash itself against the walls and ceiling, often till
nearly stunned, when I used to catch it and let it out. In the house where I
live here, one of the men has grown nasturtiums up his window box, and the
southern form of the above (A. Leucophcea ) almost daily comes to flutter around
the flowers and sometimes comes right inside the room to feed on those that
grow through the balustrades, but I am afraid I should meet considerable
opposition if I attempted a capture of that fowl. This is right in the middle of
Lima too. I have lately come across a magnificent Humming Bird at 7,800,
one of the Petasophorse (I think Anais). It is a huge bird fora Hummer (or
seemed so till the day before yesterday, when I got my first Giant Hummer in
the same place). This Petasophora is, as you probably know, vivid green, with
the most iridescent sapphire throat and elongated feathers on the ear, and with
a large splotch of sapphire on the lower belly. I got another fine Hummer there
also, with a garnet throat. I havn't an idea what he is. The Giant Hummers
are extraordinary to watch flying. Taczanowski says like a Swift, but they
seem to me to skim and flit more like a bat. You also get the beautiful little
Thaumastura Cora there, which is also the commonest of its family down here,
but only in the summer.
Glad you liked the article. Some time ago I put together some notes for
an article on Finches ; but the trouble is that I have now got three more kinds
from Matucana (7,800 feet), which I cannot so far identify, and shall have to
send to Chubb. If I might suggest as to the plate for same, I should figure one
of the following Phrygilus Fruticeti, Catamenia Analoides, Plieucticus
Clirysogaster, or one of those that I can't nard&amp;apos;e, a large bird with general huffish
colouring underneath, and white throat and dark grey above. Perhaps some of
these have been already figured. Anyhow, I will send some good skins to colour
from.
Yes, I take in the Avicultural Magazine, but am not having it sent
out here [Lima].
I am afraid I do not keep a diary that would be any use for publication.
I have a large book in which I enter under its name (or a name I invent for it)
each new bird that I come across and jot down any fact I notice about it, such as
abundance, food, habits, where to be found, etc., etc.
Yours sincerely, BRABOURNE.
[And it is men like Lord Brabourne which this terrifically appalling war
is depriving us of! !--ED.]

Dr. M. Amsler has bred Phrygilus fruticeti (a S. American finch) and
also the Orchard Finch. All of these are, we believe, for the first time, and
therefore medal winners, after a detailed account has appeared in the

NOTICE !
Why do not members advertise their birds in this Magazine ? There is
an absurd idea that other periodicals answer better for this purpose.
Of course they do, if advertisements are sent to them and not to the

The Editor advertised a pair of Conures (euops) last month, and sold them
imm ediately.
Will not some Member take up this department ?
Members should realise that the Editor is a Country Squire, decidedly in

(Calophasis mikado).
By Mrs. JOHNSTONE.
The first intimation of the existence of the Mikado Pheasant
was announced by Mr. Walter Goodfellow on his return from an
expedition to Formosa in 1910. During his stay there, in pursuit
of live birds of all sorts, he entered into conversation with a friendly
native, and noticed that the man was wearing in his hair a peculiar
Pheasant tail-feather; he asked to be allowed to see it and the man
immediately presented him with it.
He recognised that the feather belonged to no known species
of Pheasant, and hearing the birds were to be found on Mount
Arizan, he made an expedition there, hoping to obtain skins, at any
rate. In this he was so far successful, that he secured an adult hen
only ; so the colouring of the male bird, with the exception of the
tail-feather, still remained a mystery.
In 1911, the present Lord Rothschild sent Japanese collectors
to Formosa, and they returned with several adult skins of both
sexes, but no living specimen.
In January, 1912, Mr. Goodfellow started on another expe-
dition, with the express purpose of obtaining living specimens, and
in the following October returned with eight cocks and three hens.
To obtain these birds he formed two camps on Mount Arizan at
7,000 feet and 8,000 feet respectively. He found the Pheasants
very scarce, and, after some months of patient work, he and the
natives succeeded in trapping thirteen living specimens. Two of

these were accidentally killed by a fall of a tree, and eleven ulti-
mately reached England--eight males and three females.
They were installed in comfortable aviaries, and the follow-
ing year a good many of both sexes were hatched and successfully
reared.
The egg almost exactly resembles rather a small white hen's
egg. The first batch of eggs I placed under sitting hens, and some
were kindly reared for me by Mr. Seth-Smith at the Zoological
Gardens. But this year I have allowed the Mikado to sit on her
own eggs, and she is a very careful and devoted mother.
The food is not a difficulty, being the same as with other
Pheasants, but they require more green food, of which they are
very fond, and soon eat down a patch of growing grass. I give
lettuce in addition.
Dryness, I am sure, is essential in winter; as, indeed, it is
preferable for any Pheasant. Cold and damp rapidly produces liver
troubles.
Several crosses were tried, but the only successful one up to
the present has been with the female of the Elliott Pheasant. This
cross produces a very large handsome bird; the marking partaking
more of the Elliott than the Mikado ; the tail feathers, however,
resemble the Mikado.
Several true pairs of these birds are in various parts of Eng-
land. One pair I presented to the Zoological Gardens; some are in
the New York Zoological Gardens, and others have gone to France
and Australia.
At the time of writing, I have two fine pairs, but both my
hens are young home-bred birds and I have three very strong
chicks hatched. I hope however to have more presently. I have
found no difficulty in rearing the young birds, but have carefully
avoided interbreeding, which is doubtless the main cause of delicacy
in any breed.

GERMANS.
One has hitherto had to acknowledge that on the whole the
German Bird dealers were in many points superior to the English.
Let it be frankly said that they have been, with some exceptions of
course amongst the English ones, more honest, more thorough in
their care of the birds, more enterprising in obtaining rarities, more
courteous to their clients. With those exceptions amongst our own
people, one would wish to advise the recalcitrant to study in the
future to climb higher, since their opportunity when the war is
finished may truly come. And as war cleanses, purifies and uplifts,
let it do so also to our bird-dealers ; for surely one can never again,
until the German people are also cleansed and purified and changed,
have dealings with any one of them, however pleasant individually,
since they are members of a nation which has proved itself by
the action of its head and of its leaders, something so monstrously
vile and venomous, so inhuman and devilish, so unthinkably cruel
and murderous, that one must assuredly cut it off with all that
appertaineth thereto, and cast it from one ! And this in no mere
\0x25A0spirit of revenge and spite, but just because in every way that is
possible, a just punishment must be meted out. To continue to
encourage Germans as we have done would be to play with dan-
gerous explosives.
But as far as traffic in birds is concerned, the English dealers
must set an example for good, remembering the old adage of the best
policy being honesty. One has, before now, cut off from one's list,
dealers who are not only dishonest, but who, without any provoca-
tion, will be impertinent and untrue even to their written word,
which after all is what the world has cried out against in the case
of the German leaders. One has entered shops in the past where
the olfactory nerves are grossly offended, where the birds, accustomed
by nature to pure air, food, and water, are cramped in foul and un-
washen cages, many dying miserably in a miserable prison.
And therefore it is that more upright and humane dealers in
'Live Stock,' find it necessary to advertise their birds (and mammals)

as kept, not in shops, but in open aviaries and so on ; an announce-
ment, which, if there were no overcrowdings and neglect of sanitary
arrangements in the trade, would be unnecessary.
Beautiful hand-reared Skylarks, singing gloriously, and larger
than anybody else's Skylark, only costing two shillings, should dis-
appear from the columns of British birds in Bird papers and journals,
since the deception and the lie is manifest.
Nightingales* in full song for 7/6, which are for sale in April
and May, when none have been advertised all through the previous
autumn and winter ; or if they have, their price has been very con-
siderably larger; should not be permitted, since they are obviously
wild-caught birds immediately after their arrival from Africa.
At any rate, would not aviculturists be far more inclined to
purchase if the vendor honestly stated " Freshly-caught birds, and
therefore not really tame."
But as the dealer in question might be overhauled by the
authorities, he or she pretends they are nothing of the kind, and so
it comes about that many a bird seller vies with another in tricks of
the trade. And that trick too of advertising what is not in stock,
never has been, and never will be as far as immediate purchase is
concerned, is an obnoxious and dishonest one, which in time must
detract from the dealer's good name.
There should be a union of those who wish to deal honestly,,
clubbing together to put down such detriments. Why should not
birds of a feather, flock together? A trade's union to protect them-
selves from their worst foes, the ones of their own household.
Why should they not meet once a year, say at the London Zoo-
logical Gardens, where aviculturists could also gather together, each
seeking helpful advice and gaining mutual encouragement from the
other ? H. D. A.

Nettapus coromandelianus.
By Hubert D. Astley.
There is not much doubt that this charming little duck can,
if once acclimatized, be as easily kept in England as any other of
its family. I have one male, I am referring to the Indian Cotton
Teal, which has successfully passed through two winters on open
water, as well as two males and four females which have now been
in my possession for a year.
That I should have had four more of this species I do not
doubt, had not a large rat dived under the wire netting of their
enclosure and killed them, proving how persistent and destructive
these horrible animals are, for there were only two or three inches
of space beneath the water, where the wire hurdles did not actually
touch the bottom.
The three surviving male Cotton Teal emerged from their
eclipse plumage into full colour by the end of April, after which they
were extremely handsome with their snow white cheeks and flanks,
narrow black band from the shoulder and dark bottle-green backs.
Moreover for the first time since I have had them, they commenced
to utter calls in unison, a low sharp-sounding quacking, rather
resembling the croak of green tree-frogs in the distance. I have
not had leisure to observe any display on the part of the males,
but I have seen them swim round the females, circling about, and
trying to look important.
I am sure these ducks should not be kept where they cannot
have open air and fresh water, on which they spend nearly all of their
time. A pair had been put in the Fish House at the London
Zoological Gardens, and the male failing to moult freely, succumbed.
My birds have passed the winter where ice sometimes formed on
the water, and are in magnificent condition and plumage. I placed
branches of trees in the water, but have seldom, and of late never
seen the Cotton Teal make use of them.
They can and do perch--as they did in the Zoological
Gardens--but from the behaviour of my birds, it is evident that if
they have sufficient water, they prefer that.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
Their food consists of dari and hemp as well as watercress,
etc., when in season, besides which they probably eat the fresh-
water shrimps which are naturally in the pond.
So long as the water is fresh, etc., a confined space does not
seem to matter, for their wire enclosure is only about fourteen feet
square. Only one of my Cotton Teal is pinioned, as the enclosure
is roofed with wire, but I wanted to see whether, contrary to what
was told me, this species could stand the operation.

If Mr. Newmarsh, who is the manager of this department,
goes on as he is doing&amp;apos;, " Carnage's " in Holborn, (as all the world
knows) should attract a goodly number of aviculturists. But what all
the world does not know, at any rate I didn't, is that Mr Newmarsh
started the live-stock with a few canaries and such like ordinary
fry, and has worked it up to such rarities as Pink-crested Touracos,
with lesser lights in the shape of Melba Finches, Rosy-faced Love
Birds, etc. Members may say, "the Editor is very ignorant, we
have known Gamage's live stock department for ages." I was
written to by Mr. Newmarsh, who by the way is assisted by one
who was a bird-keeper at Woburn Abbey, asking me whether I
wanted Pink-crested Touracos.
Happening to be in London a few days afterwards, I went.
On entering the emporium, that I believe is the correct word, there
is no sign of Touracos or of any other bird; one passes through
mowing-machines, wearing apparel, and numerous other commodi-
ties for supplying oneself with food and clothing, etc., until at the
far end, seeing a notice directing you by a kind of downward subway
to the Zoological Department, one finds oneself amongst incubators,
poultry (I carried off five Silkies), pigeons, and so on; but for
Touracos it is a case of " nest compartment please," and there in an
ante-chamber were the Touracos. One had thought the German

submarines in particular, and the war in general, had made people
shy of importing birds, but here last April were four individuals of
the most beautiful species of the family, besides a large cage full of
Rosy-faced Lovebirds, and in other cages, quite a dozen Melba
finches, if not more ; all lately arrived from Africa. I began to wish
I held shares in Gamage's. I must have helped to send them up,
for I departed with the four Touracos, two pairs of Melba Finches
and one true pair of Indigo birds, as well as an incubator and the
five Silky Fowls, already mentioned.
Mr. Newmarsh is a great lover of birds, which just makes
the whole difference to the birds and the purchasers thereof; further-
more, his father, grandfather, and great grandfather have been
aviculturists before him.
Most of the birds are kept in a large and lofty room, looking
well cared for. There was a small and rare Amazon, the species I
was not sure of, but it may have been a White-fronted Amazon in
immature plumage. There were other members of the Parrot family ;
really the young Rosy-faced Love Birds were a fine lot and a big
lot. And mammals too. A small lemur, perhaps a " Bush-baby "
from Africa, very tame and confiding, with slender fingers ; some
Ichneumons, etc.
To return to the subject of the Touracos, I may mention for
the sake of those who have never seen them, that they are the same
size, style and general colouring as in the case of the White-crested
Touracos, which have an edging of white on the crest of the green
head ; but this other species has the whole crest of a beautiful rose-
red, and still the white edging to it. The face and chin is greyish
white ; the whole upper body and tail, iridescent shining blue bottle
green with blue and purplish lights, the tail being bluer than the rest,
the lower body, dull green, the flight feathers as in some of the
other Touracos, brilliant cardinal red; the bill, primrose yellow.
I believe its Latin name is Turacus erythroloptius.
Touracos should be fed upon bananas, scalded dried figs and
other fruits, cut up and mixed in some good insectivorous food.
They need plenty of room, and a warm shelter in winter time. In
due season they delight in grapes, strawberries, and so on, and are
not averse to mealworms. They will become very tame, uttering

their loud croaking notes as a welcome. Furthermore they will
nest in an aviary, but have a tiresome habit of not succeeding in
rearing their young. Cf. Vol. VII. p. 350, 1908-1909. About the

THE BREEDING OF THE AFRICAN
WHITE-EYE.
Zoster ops viridis.
|By Dr. L. Lovell-Keays.
May 1915 sees me a very happy man wanting to shake hands
with myself. Come with me, I say, and I will show you why.
Our path leads to a space enclosed with fine wire mesh and planted
in it a large variety of shrubs--evergreen and flowering--a refreshing
green sward, well-trodden gravel pathways and a most inviting bath
for the birds. The growth is so dense in parts that one does not
realise the space enclosed is nearly 30 feet by 20 feet, but that is
the size in round numbers, and the size is an important factor in
view of the highly interesting event that has taken place there
lately. The scene on a sunny morning is enchanting. Vividly
coloured Parrot Finches chasing one another for a time. Then one
of them feels lonely, perches on the top of Rambler rose and filling
his tiny lungs very full sends forth a defiant chirruping call. As
we watch, loving little Grassfinches (P. cicuticauda) flit about and
with courtly bow and coaxing song, sing aloud the praises of
their lady love. Their little gorgettes sw T ell out with unmistakeable
pride at the possession of so charming a bride. Leaving our Grass-
finches we notice the dapper little Hooded Siskin chanting his song
to Helios for his kindly warmth, reminding him of his sunny home
in the far west. The brilliant orange red stands out against the
tender May greens, but alack ! his modestly attired spouse seems
little interested in either him or his song. For certainly the song is
lost in the more resonant notes of the gay Indigo Bunting sitting
proudly on a pear tree and pouring forth his morning melody. But

as we look we notice a little creature nearly as small as our
Siskin, as active as an ant, searching every nook and cranny, now
hanging head down, now upside down, jumping, flitting, perching,
flying, calling, singing, catching, prying, and everything so quickly
that before you realise it is a bird you are looking at, it is gone or
perhaps another has joined it. This is my little friend Zosterops
viridis. He has made a long, long journey to make me happy, and
I, in my turn, must endeavour to do to him as he has done to me.
That is why I give him (and her too, for I have a pair of them) plenty
of space, and a famous old plum tree that once disfigured the back of
my house and harboured countless hordes of insects. I allowed to
throw out the long shoots, and then adveniente autunmno " the
axe was laid to the root and the tree planted bodily in the aviary.
An Evangeline rose now rambles over and lingers on the new stems
that gave such promise for the forthcoming year.
Most of us know the Zosterops. That sweet, quaint little
bird, full of life and activity, with its complete costume of yellowish
green--self-colour the salesman would call it--and that character-
istic white ring round the eye, which gives the bird the scientific
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7128675" page_id="32670367"  page_num="273" year="" vol="">
name of Zosterops. I believe the derivation is Greek and means a
girdle or circlet about the eye. In Africa it is sometimes called the
11 Spectacle Bird " or " White-eye." The eye is of course black, or
apparently so, and it is only the palpebrae that are white. Still
"white-eyes" is good enough and reminds one very pleasantly of
" Goldie Locks " and other charming personages of our childhood's
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9816535" page_id="32670367"  page_num="273" year="" vol="">
days. We notice our Zosterops has a small body with fine delicate
legs, a sharp-pointed beak--obviously designed for getting into
crevices--an eye which nothing escapes, and a fearlessness which we
look for in an insectivorous bird, but seldom find in the average
hardbill. Softbills trust in man and will learn to seek his aid in
rearing their young, but with hardbills we have no part or lot in the
matter.
I obtained my Zosterops early in 1914, and by the merest
chance they turned out to be a true pair. The sex is one quite easy
to tell in an aviary. The cock is, as Dr. Butler points out, much
more snake-like and somewhat lighter in colour. He is also I found
out less unselfish. I can tell my birds instantly, even when only

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays,
one is in view. They made a very good attempt at breeding in 1914
and built a nest of hay at the very top of the aviary and hidden in a
Retinospora. There were two egg&amp;apos;s of very pale greenish blue,
somewhat elliptical in shape and large for so small a bird. This
seems a characteristic of softbills, as far as my experience goes.
Both eggs hatched out and the parents fed most assiduously, but I
was the murderer I believe. I offered the parents gentles and black
aphis from an elder tree. The young died the same day, aged about
5-6 days as far as I could determine.
They made no further attempt at nesting in 1914, and in
November I gathered them up and put them with my most treasured
feathered possessions in my best bird room, I didn't doubt the
wintering-out-of-doors theory a little bit, but then you see I wasn't
taking any risks with my favourites. Consequently they went
through the winter living entirely on sop made of sponge cake and
Swiss milk (mixed, of course, w T ith hot water) and banana as their
staple diet. Insectile mixture was offered to them and oranges and
grapes occasionally. They seldom if ever took mealworms, for
Zosterops don't like the ground at all. They suffered no appreciable
moult, and never looked sad, sick, or sorry. They never bullied
others nor tolerated interference themselves. They behaved them-
selves like perfect little gentle-folk.
About April 5th I noticed the cock bird carrying grass, which
I had supplied to amuse the Parrot Finches to keep them from
" chivvying " the other birds too much. So I decided to risk it and
turn them out into my Grassfinches' aviary. They at once set about
nest-building but seemed to lack something. I tried various things,
but found that string well ravelled out, tow and horse-hair pleased
them best. With this they constructed the most exquisite little
cradle nest it has ever been my lot to see in an aviary. I am no
draughtsman, so I got Mr. E. A. Jones, of East Hoathly, to make a
drawing which is being reproduced for the purpose of illustrating this
article. It was built in an Aucuba in a very well-sheltered corner
and quite low down. I could watch every incident as it happened
and I will quote from my diary as I noticed the events. The nest
is singularly small for the size of bird, and measures but If inches
in diameter and is two inches deep. It is quite globular and very

frail, but it served its purpose admirably. The cock did most of the
nest-building, but the hen certainly did a great deal of the final
touching up.
Finally, on April 18th the first egg was laid, and by its size
one might have suspected the wrong bird had laid in the nest. It
was, as already described, more elliptical than oval and of a very pale
greenish blue colour. The hen began to sit as soon as the first egg
was laid, and subsequent events proved the unwisdom of this. The
birds took turns to sit and I don't remember ever seeing the cock
feed the hen on the nest. I doubt if he ever did. 4 '
On Thursday, April 22nd, there were three eggs, and this
was the first time I had seen the nest untenanted, as the birds sat
very tight.
Nothing of note happened until April 24th, when the hen
bird looked very puffy and I feared I was going to lose her. How-
ever, it passed off and by April 27th she was well again, but one
egg had disappeared. I don't think there are any mice there, and
there are no reputed egg&amp;apos;-eaters in the aviary.
Excitement was running high on April 29th, for I noticed the
Zosterops were feeding, but I did not like to risk too close an in-
spection, besides which both birds never left the nest at the same
time. However, on April 30th, I seized my opportunity and saw
two whitish little birds, not a vestige of clothing on and with long
necks which shot up and simply quivered with suppressed excitement
and expectation. The young were obviously very vigorous and
healthy. Even at this stage one young one appeared older than the
other--about 24 hours I should say. The parents fed the young on
small gnats, flies, etc., which fortunately abounded at the time.
The weather was simply perfect. Not a drop of rain and bright hot
sun all day. The Fates were propitious this time and I felt confident
of their help.
The little birds grew rapidly until May 4th, when I noticed
that the young were still flesh-coloured but with very dark-coloured
feather tracts. Eyes not yet open.
On May 5th I had a very thorough examination, as a good

opportunity presented itself, and the birds began to leave the nest to-
gether frequently. One young bird was much bigger than the other,
and was more forward in other ways. The general body colour was
flesh-coloured with a little white down on the head. Well-marked
dark-coloured feather tracts, especially on the older bird. The older
bird was now about seven days old and the parents gave it it&amp;apos;s first
mealworm. I had bred a few of these myself and carefully picked out
very small worms about half-an-inch long and those with soft skins.
For the next few days the babies were brought up chiefly on
small mealworms, and of course any wandering or misguided
hymenoptera or diptera that might stray into the aviary.
On May 6th Zosterops No. 1 was just beginning to open its
eyes, and there was a kind of hog's mane along the back and sides
of its body. By May 7th the eyes of No. 1 were distinctly open.
The quills of the elder bird began to split on May 8th, and
one could see that the quills were the precursors of feathers. The
primaries were growing very fast by this time and the growth and
development of the first bird was simply amazing. The " little
brother " appeared to be quite two days behind it. Mealworms
were taken very freely and this date is remarkable for the fact that
small insects ceased to be the staple diet, but the birds gave the
young sop for the first time and, I believe, banana.
On May 9th sop was frequently given to the young, and
meal worms when they could get them. The feathers showed a
distinct green tinge. The second young one now began to make
up for lost time and made considerable progress, but obviously the
parents preferred the first born ; also the first born was very greedy.
I find a note stating that the sun was very hot and the wind N.E.
By May 10th Zosterops No. 1 was fully feathered and he
was looking very alert. No. 2 was just showing the quills.
On May 11th I w ? as looking at the babies from quite a
distance when No. 1 looked steadily and suspiciously at me, then
suddenly with a loud cry left the nest. No. 2 caught the infection
and blundered out after No. 1. I at length succeeded in catching
both young birds and putting them back, but No. 1 was not to be
denied his liberty, and finally got right away, but No. 2 I did per-
suade to remain at home a little longer.

On May 12fch No. 1 was hopping freely about from twig to
twig and getting all the tit-bits from his fond parents, but No. 2 was
neither forgotten nor neglected and continued to grow apace, and to
my chagrin I noticed that restless look in his eye.
May 13th was the worst day we have had for months. It
rained incessantly for 36 hours, i.e. from May 12th to May 14th.
I dare not go near the aviary, fearing lest I should disturb the
young birds and make them forsake a sheltered position for an
exposed one. However, the rain stopped on Friday, the 14th, and
I had a good search for my young friends. No. 1 was easily found
and was certainly ' going strong," and I noticed that for the first
time he didn't wait to be fed, but took it from the old birds, i.e. he
pecked at it, and I take it that this was the first step towards
catering for himself. The young at this time is quite unlike the
parents, with a large gape which is apparently carried down as two
yellow moustachial streaks down each side of the neck, giving it a
very clown-like appearance. There is none of the roundness and
nattiness about the young that one finds in the parents, and of course
no white palpebral ring. The tail is quite short, fan-shaped, and
looks like a series of short paint brushes stuck in the hind part.
As to Zosterops No. 2 I could find no trace of it, though
once or twice I imagined the parents went to feed it. At any rate,
I never saw a sign of the little bird again and I fear it must pass
out of the picture for good and all.
On May 15th our young Zosterops first assumed the hanging
posture so peculiar to the Tits and other insectivorous birds. This
was evidently the next step in hunting for its prey. The hen bird
was still mothering her first love and it was a charming sight to see
her protecting her infant, now nearly full-grown, under the shadow
of her outstretched wing.
By May 16th the young one was flying freely from tree to
tree and I noticed that he deliberately preened each of his feathers,
particularly the primaries and tail-feathers, himself ; obviously he
was equipping himself for the adventures of life. The old cock bird
began to drive the hen to nest again and to construct a new nest
in an Evangeline rose.
On May 17th I thought I could detect a very faint trace of a

white ring round the eye. The tail was growing rapidly and the
little fellow rapidly becoming independent of its parents, taking flights
on its own account. Parents no longer so anxious to feed their off-
spring ; in fact the cock became quite an egoist. The hen only feeds
the young one very occasionally and then he helps himself and is no
longer crammed.
By May 18th both old birds actively building a new nest and
the young bird flourishing in spite of continued and torrential rains.
May 22nd. A later note shows my young Zosterops search-
ing for insects among the trees and shrubs. The hen bird has
completely forsaken her child. The old birds have completed a new
nest as beautiful as the old one, and already there is an egg in it.
The cock however still gives the adolescent Zosterops an occasional
tit-bit and they chum up together on cold days. The tail-feathers
are nearly complete, but there is no mistaking the young bird for he
looks quite unlike his parents. The white eye is now distinctly
indicated. Since May 18th we have had more rain, but the young
Zosterops is made of tough material and takes little notice of
either rain or N.E. wind. Here we must leave our Zosterops and
make preparations for the advent of another family, but not without
wishing him a successful journey as he goes forth to the battle of
life.
June 20th. On going to press I have to record another young
Zosterops fully reared. Three were hatched. One disappeared soon
after and another fell out of the nest when a week old. The third
survived and is doing well. All four Zosterops are excellent friends
and can be seen frequently cuddling up together. The first young
one is almost indistinguishable from the old birds now, but is a
distinct yellowish green and therefore much lighter in colour. His
"white eye" is fully developed. Like Barabbas, however, he is a
robber, and has been known to steal the new baby's mealworm not
only from the parents but from the baby himself. Otherwise his
behaviour is exemplary.
[The Indian Zosterops has been bred in England, but not Z. viridis , as
far as we know. Dr. Lovell-Keays is therefore entitled to a medal.--ED.]

Cuckoos' Habits in the Breeding Season. 279
CUCKOOS' HABITS IN THE BREEDING
SEASON.
By Hubert D. Astley.
On the 25th of May--such a gorgeous morning--I was
awakened at 5.30 by the sonorous notes of a Cuckoo, which must
have flown close past two of the open windows of my bedroom, and
then I heard him still calling and evidently stationary within 60
yards of me.
I hurried out of my bed. Directed by the sound of his fine
ringing voice, and really there is no sound more wonderful at such
close quarters, I saw him perched on the top of the pergola which
spans a flower-edged brick path between the moat, surrounding the
house, and a pond. His long tail was pointing upwards, the feathers
spread, and he was evidently in a state of excitement. Cuck-cuckoo-
cuck-cuckoo ; his notes resounding. And then he flew down to the
edge of the pond, whether to drink or not, I could nt see, for the
solid oak beams and uprights of the pergola hid him from view.
At that moment my eye was attracted to a fluttering and struggling
of wings just where some honeysuckle has grown up one of the oak
uprights, and almost underneath where the cuckoo was perched.
Seizing my field-glasses, I was greatly thrilled to find it was a female
cuckoo, which was hanging on to the squared side of the timber,
partly supporting herself by the growth of honeysuckle, and inserting
her head into a smallish aperture in the wood, probably one cut out
originally for the end of a transverse beam, when these old timbers
formed part of the roof of a barn. She remained like that for at
least six or eight minutes, constantly popping her head into and out
of the hole. Once a male Chaffinch swooped at her, backwards and
forwards, uttering a 'pink-pink' of alarm or indignation, and the
Cuckoo, still hanging on to the upright beam und still fluttering her
wings, turned up her head at the Chaffinch and opened her mouth
so that I could plainly see her orange gape.
Then she returned to her business, popping her head into the
hole again, as if she was either eating or arranging something. At
last she flew off with clucking notes, and was immediately followed
by the male. I heard his passionate cuck-cuckoo, cuck-cuckoo,

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
dying away as he disappeared round the corner of the house. Then
I hurriedly dressed, took a light ladder, propped it up against the
pergola and peered in. A Pied Wagtail's nest with two eggs, and
a Cuckoo's ! all most neatly arranged.
She must, after depositing the egg from her mouth in the
nest, have been busily arranging things so that all should look well
on the Wagtail's return. Of the latter I saw nothing. It was
curious that a Chaffinch should have taken up the cudgels. It was
an uncommon scene, which more than repaid one for being awoken
at 5.30 a.m.
But I certainly did, when I saw how busy she was, begin to
think is she "sucking little birds' eggs to make her voice clear." It
looked so very like it. The egg was bluish, but speckled. Deci-
dedly blue in comparison with the colour of the Wagtail's eggs, but
still not really blue, but as I have said of a bluish tint. I left it,
although I pity the fate of the poor baby Wagtails, which will
inevitably be hoiked into the moat, for the upright beam is on
the verge of it, the aperture in which the nest is built, facing it.
What doubles the interest of this episode of a May morning
is that the male Cuckoo was quite evidently excited about it ;
although such a thing has before now been observed. Whether the
female Cuckoo had just arrived with her mate, I don't know. I am
inclined to think so : for even as I saw her she was a long time at
the nest; which I may add is eight feet from the ground.
And then people talk of the instinct of the lower creatures as
something that compels them to act, without possessing reasoning
power! In the first place, the Cuckoo would have to watch the
water-wagtails, for I cannot suppose she would search in places
where she would have to cling on with evident difficulty in obtaining
a foothold, unless she was sure there was a proper receptacle for her
egg. And on seeing the Wagtails building, she would continue to
watch. No human knew of the nest, although I for one constantly
walked past it, and constantly saw the Wagtails in its near vicinity.
Indeed I had gone so far as to wonder where they were building;
for last year they reared three broods in a hole in an old stone wall,
and this year the hole was vacant. Moreover the Cuckoo waits
until one or two eggs are laid by the foster-parents of its future off-

spring. Again, the bird must deliberately keep an eye on all that
they are doing, for don't tell me that Cuckoos invariably come across
nests by chance, in which the full complement of eggs is not yet
laid ; and do Cuckoos ever make mistakes, putting an egg in a nest
where the other eggs may be ready to hatch. I don't think so ?
My pair of Cuckoos arrived together, as far as I could make
out, just as they departed together, and must have known before-
hand of the Wagtails' nest, and that the moment had come for the
egg to be deposited. All of which shows as much power of reasoning
along its own particular line, as we ourselves possess in ours ; an
absolute result of forethought; just as those abominable Sparrows
most deliberately watch House Martin's building their nests, and
rush up with hay and feathers directly the poor Martins have so far
completed the nest as to leave a sufficient space for the Sparrows to
fill it in with their untidy gatherings of material. As far as I can see,
when once the Martins have fully completed the nest, leaving only a
small entrance under the eaves, the Sparrows cannot very easily
enter. I have seen the little brutes sitting on a roof, quite evidently
watching the Martins, and letting them diligently ply backwards and
forwards with mouthfuls of mud, until the nest forms a solid plat-
form for the Hun birds !
Why ! they just make me mad ! There was such a Martin's
nest above one of my bedroom windows, which I could easily reach
with a hand, and I daily, indeed twice daily, pulled out the hay and
feathers that the Sparrows put in, yet still they went on, German
Kaiser-like, bombarding other birds houses, when they might be
content with their own.
Perhaps it would be best to let the little horrors build their
nests and then one might seize on the bird and wring her interfering
neck ! Last year three pairs of Martins were building in the court-
yard, much to our delight, and if three pairs of Sparrows didn't
deliberately take possession just when the mud foundations were
sufficiently advanced for them to do so : and the merry little Martins
had to begin all over again somewhere else.
If Sparrows acted by so-called instinct, why don't they build
their own untidy nests as they can do if they choose. Unfortunately
they reason. " Here you are, a great deal of trouble saved ; let

Do what he may, the aviculturist as a general rule finds it
almost impossible to keep mice out of his aviaries ; and when these
vermin have once established themselves, they will (unless circum-
vented) devour more food than the birds. A cemented concrete floor
does not suffice to keep mice out of an aviary ; for when three parts
grown they can easily slip through half-inch wire netting.
As a slight illustration, I may mention that each week for
years past I have twisted millet-sprays into the wire-netting of one
of my aviaries for the benefit of my Gouldian* and other finches,
and although (excepting when first renewed) I rarely see any finches
upon them, the seed has usually wholly disappeared from them
within three or four days. Concluding&amp;apos; that mice were responsible
for the rapid consumption of the seed, I tried suspending it at the
end of a long wire from the roof of the aviary, with the result that
it now lasts from two to three weeks without renewal.
In like manner seed-hoppers hung upon the wirework are
rapidly cleared out, and open pans of seed, if placed upon the floor
or upon a shelf, are not only freely plundered, but are liable to be
fouled by the vermin and thus rendered a source of danger to delicate
birds. To lay down poisoned food outside an aviary is risky, since
there is no certainty that mice may not carry some of it inside and
thus cause death to one's pets. The much advertized mouse- and
rat-virus used to be very satisfactory; whether it is now prepared
with less care than it formerly was, or whether it is kept too long

by the chemists from whom one orders it I don't know, but it is
certain that the last three tubes which I purchased were entirely
ineffective.
Traps of various kinds are useful until the mice get accus-
tomed to them, after which they become very uncertain. I believe I
have tided most of those on the market with very varying&amp;apos; results.
In my youthful days the wood and wire clap-trap was considered
quite satisfactory; now one may set a dozen of those and not a
mouse enters one of them : there used to be a double trap, the bait
for which was contained in a central depression with a perforated
zinc cover : so far as I remember, for I have not seen one of these
traps for some forty or fifty years, the entrances at each end were
formed after the pattern of a lobster-pot.*
The wooden garrotting traps with two or three opening&amp;apos;s, en-
circled when set by wire nooses passed through slots and attached
to powerful springs, seems to have gone out of fashion ; they were a
bother to set, as the nooses were held in place by cotton thread
passed through small holes pierced at top and bottom of the trap.
Behind these threads the bait--usually flour--was placed, and to get
at it the mice had to bite through the cotton, which of course
released the spring and promptly choked them. A somewhat similar,
but better, German tin trap of circular shape with about eight holes
round the sides, used to be obtainable ; in that the spring nooses
were held down by hooks after the pattern of the clap-trap. I have
known the wooden type to catch three mice in a night and its
German representative from two to four; but after a time the
cunning little quadrupeds become suspicious and ignore them.
I have heard of, but never seen, a dead-fall trap ; used, I am
told, by the Sussex peasantry and stated to be very deadly ; I believe
it flattens its victims: the explanation of the mechanism of this
trap was given to me by a Sussex-born bricklayer and was certainly
not lucid. I fancy it must have been worked somewhat on the
principle of the ancient brick trap for catching sparrows, only there
was a tunnel through which the mouse ran, and in the middle of
which the weight fell.
* I have a vague remembrance also of a domed wire-trap made with similar
entrances.

Take them all round there is nothing&amp;apos; to equal the break-backs
for execution, although after a time one may have a dozen of these
set in every corner most frequented by the vermin without catching
one for several weeks in succession and then, without any apparent
reason, you may secure one or two every night. The chief objec-
tion to the break-back trap is that it occasionally catches a mouse
by the hind leg or tail and thus causes unsatisfactory suffering,
although doubtless our conception of the pain is far greater than
it actually is, since a mouse caught by the leg or tail will sometimes
bite it off in order to escape.
One of the most ingenious and complex contrivances is the
water-trap : I fear if I tried to explain the mechanism I should be
unable to make it clear to my readers, hut it can be bought at most
oil-shops and ironmongers for one or two shillings. When I first
began to keep birds I purchased one : and, when new, it used to
entice from two to four mice to a watery grave every night; but
after a time they refused to enter it and the tank rusted through.
Years later I bought another, on the back of which was a heart-
rending picture of two mice weeping into pocket-handkerchiefs,
presumably over the death of near relatives.
I had this second water-trap set for months and not a mouse
entered it, so I put it aside as useless. A month or two ago my
gardener proposed to set it again and I told him that it was no
use; he could not see why, nor could I ; but, for a jest, I said to
him--" Can you wonder that the mice fight shy of the trap with
that terrible picture staring them in the face?" I don't know
whether he thought there was anything in it, but he tore off the
illustration, set the trap, and that night a young and foolish mouse
was drowned, but that was the last for weeks; then he set it
again and caught three in one night, but since then it is rarely of
any use.
Of course the quickest way to demolish mice is to pour water
down their holes and knock them over as they rush out, only they
make so many holes and most of these are unoccupied and the
water makes such a mess ; besides it is not exactly pleasant work
to knock over the little wretches with a thick stick, though it is
perhaps as merciful a death as any other when it has to be done, I

generally get my gardener to execute ; he is quick and with moderate
luck few escape him.
Now, although one must do all one can to reduce the numbers
of these little pests; it is, at the same time, best to continue to
place food-pans out of their reach. Some years ago I had several
contrivances made to suspend from wires hooked into the half-inch
netting at the top of one of my aviaries : a saucer-like chinaware
gas-cover with central hole had a short eve-bolt passed through it
and tightened in place by a brass nut. It was attached above to
the suspended wire and from below a short chain was attached,
terminating in a hook on which a small metal cup with wire handles
was hung: in the latter the seed was placed, and any mouse which had
the temerity to descend the wire, was bound to slip off the polished
surface of the saucer and fall about five feet to the cement floor.
This little scheme answered perfectly until the breeding
season came round ; then Grey Singing-finches and Cherry-finches
decided to utilize the metal cups as nesting-receptacles and conse-
quently threw out most of the seed upon the floor, doubtless to the
great delight of the mice; I therefore had to think out some other
plan : I went to an ironmonger and asked him if he had anything in
the way of heavy metal bases to support an upright standard with
small platform on top. He got out some quaint-looking things
which he said he sold to publicans, but he did not know what they
were used for : I fancy they are rests for foaming beer-mug&amp;apos;s, designed
to keep the tables clean, as the centre is raised level with the outer
rim and between the two is a shallow gutter.
Through the centre of these iron bases I had a threaded hole
drilled, into which a smooth cylindrical steel rod about half a yard
long was screwed, its upper extremity being screwed into a light
circular brass disc. The base of the stand was about 7 inches and
the platform at the top about 5 inches in diameter. Upon these
an open flower-pot saucer about 9 inches in diameter and nearly
filled with seed is placed; and thus, for years past, the mice
have only been able to get what tire birds have thrown over; still
where Doves are present this is not a little, since they are of all
birds the most wasteful; they scatter the seed apparently for the
mere pleasure of seeing it fly right and left, whereas Finches, ex-

Mr. A. Ezra,
cepting the Wlrydahs and Song-Sparrows, only do it in order to
uncover their favourite article of diet. Parrakeets are the least
wasteful feeders in my experience, but they drop all the husks in
the pan until the seed becomes entirely hidden.
It has been asserted that waste may be prevented by having
a separate hopper or pan for each kind of seed. Theoretically that
looks all right, but I have tried it : I found that the finch who was
looking for hemp and alighted on the canary hopper kept on stirring
away until the entire contents were transferred to the floor, and the
same is true of the open pan.
I thought out another plan for saving seed from mice, which
I adopted in an outdoor aviary, the back of which was boarded and
smooth. I had two square zinc pans made about three inches
in depth, the back being made high and pierced in the centre by an
inverted keyhole shaped opening. The rounded part of the keyhole
was slipped over a screw, driven well into the woodwork at a good
height from the floor in the covered part of the aviary, and then
lowered through the slot of the keyhole on to the body of the screw,
so that it could not slip off, and thus the pan w T as maintained at
right angles to the back of the aviary. In the centre of this pan I
placed a smaller and much shallower circular zinc pan which I
filled with seed : thus all seed thrown over remained in the deeper
outer pan ; and, when the husks were blown off, could be mixed
with the new supply. I believe Miss Alderson told me that she
had adopted a somewhat similar plan in her own aviaries.

me in May and is in robust health, the latter had then just com-
pleted his moult, also for the second time since I have had him,
and looks a real gem ; indeed they are two of the healthiest and
strongest birds I possess and look like living quite a long time.*
They are kept in separate cages, but are given fuller freedom in a
room for at least an hour every day, when they dart about, whirring
and flying backwards and forwards at a high speed, the vibration of
their wings being extraordinarily rapid. To this daily exercise I
attribute my success in keeping them in such perfect health, in addi-
tion to scrupulous cleanliness. They are fed exactly the same as my
Sunbirds, and do well on this liquid food, but both Humming Birds
will eat aphis, when obtainable, although they will only take the
insects when the latter are flying. They either do not care to pick
them off the tray of the cage, or else it is not their nature to do so ;
the little Green Ricord's hummer buzzes along close to the bottom
of his cage, thereby causing the aphidae to fly up, when he quickly
swallows one after another.
Not only in the summer time but also in winter the Humming
Birds are sprayed every morning with tepid water, after which they
complete their bathing by slipping in and out of the wetted leaves of
a small plant placed in their cages.
They are more pugnacious than ever, especially the tiny one
who is a demon for fighting, so they are never let out of their cages
at the same time. Once they have have had enough exercise, they
will always go back into their own cage. The Ricordi has a song
which sounds like the noise of the sparks of a wireless while
working. Of all birds I have ever kept, I find Humming Birds the
most fascinating and intelligent, and my two birds give me any
amount of pleasure. I consider myself most fortunate to have had
such success with these two birds, which were the first and only
ones I have ever had.
My Indian Amethyst-rumpefi Sunbird has gone through his
fifth moult with me and looks perfect now. Five years sounds a
long time for a tiny bird like that to live in good condition.

SIR,--It will perhaps interest you to know that I have now the four
varieties of the Pceocephalus family, namely, the Robustus or Levaillant's, the
Brown-necked or Fuscicollis, the Jardine's and the Senegal. Seen side by side
there is a very distinct difference between Levaillant's and the Brown-necked
Parrot, the tail of the latter being almost black, the tail-coverts quite a different
shade, end of the bill black at extremity and front of the head red.
I have just mentioned this as I thought it would be of interest to you.

SIR,--You will be pleased to hear that two young Jardines' Pigmy Owls
are fully reared, the third disappeared when a few days old. The young are
paler editions of their parents, (one is much less rufous than the other), the
white less white and the brown not so warm in tint. When they leave the nest
box of an evening, and all four sit together, one can see that the young have
not yet attained the full stature of their parents. They feed themselves and
talk a good deal over their food. By the way, their call is very like my Wax-
wings, the same little trilling twitter, whereas the old birds perserve a stony
silence at all times. They are shy and when they find themselves observed they
crouch down with their backs towards the visitor and put their heads (seemingly)
between their knees. But if one stands still they cannot resist bobbing up every
now and then to take stock of the enemy. Probably they will soon become
tame or at least indifferent.
My hopes and fears (chiefly the latter) are just now centred on my Yellow-
winged Blue Sugar Birds who have built a lovely little nest in the inner part of
the shelter. The hen has just begun to sit. If she should hatch and not throw
out the young forthwith. as did my Rufous-throated Sugar Bird, I wonder if
green fly would be suitable food ? She is very fond of it herself. The nest is
built of tow and lined with those fine shavings of tissue paper which are used to
pack chocolates in ; it is a deep cup, but I have not dared to look at the eggs.
The nest is high up near the roof. The cock sits near her when she is on the
nest and follows her closely whenever she comes off. She became very spiteful
towards a pair of Blue Sugar Birds just before beginning to build, and I had to
move them out of the )aviary lest from words she should proceed to deeds.
The cock Blue Sugar Bird is still in immature plumage, but I saw him
this morning trying to feed the hen with sponge cake. She would have none of
it, evidently ''does not care for boys"! ETHEL F. CHAWNER.

WINTER TREATMENT OF FOREIGN BIRDS.

SIR,--I was much interested in Dr. Lovell-Keays' paper on the Winter
Treatment of Foreign Birds in this month's Magazine, but I do not entirely
agree with all his contentions. He says "Foreign birds if left to their own
devices will not use a shelter. This, in my experience, is only the case where
the aviary contains a large amount of natural cover. Where the flight is
simply furnished with branches of trees for perches my birds go inside at night,
and they are doing it this hot weather, when one would think that they would
be much more comfortable outside. Into two of my aviaries the birds were
only introduced late in the Spring and no attempt has been made to drive them
inside. With his other conclusions I am in agreement, but go still further and
think that it is absolutely necessary that all young birds bred in the aviary
should be taken indoors in the Autumn, and kept there until after the Spring
moult.
You will be interested to hear that I have bred Melopyrrha nigra this
Spring, after nearly succeeding last season. I also have now incubating pairs
of Chloris sinicus and Conurus ocularis. I believe that neither of these species
have been bred in Great Britain. W. SHORE BAILY.

SIR,--I note your remarks with respect to advertisements in the Avi-
cultural Magazine.
I should like to say that I have over and over again urged on our Editors
some different system of advertising so as to attract our members. By the
present arrangement advertisements have to be posted on the 25 th of each
month ; it has often happened that the Magazine has not reached us until a
week after the opening of the month, you will at once see what a length of time
elapses before being able to purchase or dispose of anything.
I have suggested, and do so again, that the advertisements should be on a
separate slip of paper, to be inserted in the Magazine at the last moment before
postage. There is some reason why members do not advertise, and this appears
to me to be the one.
Your idea that some one should take up that department is an admirable
one, would that I could do it, but I have 500 orphans who take up much of my

TREATMENT OF MYNAH.

<bodyText confidence="0.998310066666667" page_id="32670393"  page_num="295" year="" vol="">
SIR,--May I venture to ask your advice re proper food for the Mynah.
I brought it back from Burma over twelve months ago. On board ship it was
fed on curry and rice, oranges and some beetles. For the last nine months my
daughter has kept it in a big cage--2ft. by 18 in. and 2ft. high -- out of doors
during the hot weather and in the kitchen during the winter. It may be the
Lark food, the bread and butter and the roast beef, but it appears that it has had
fits for some time past, and when my daughter told me I recommended her
to get mealworms.
Thanking you in anticipation for your reply and apologising for the trouble
I am giving. F. MOERSCHELL.
The folloioing reply has been sent to Mr. Moerschell :--
The Hill Mynahs or Grackles require slightly different treatment from the
more Starling-like Mynahs, and you do not say which group yours belongs to: but
there is little doubt that the beef is chiefly to blame for the bird's condition.
None of the Mynahs should have much meat and the Hill-Mynahs are
(I am satisfied) better without any. My Starling-like Mynahs had a little,
minced fine, occasionally--perhaps once a fortnight : they delighted in cock-
roaches of which they would eat any amount, and I am sure they were the better
for them : earthworms were also occasionally given and newly-born mice when
obtainable.
The staple food consisted of Trower's Cekto mixed with double its bulk of
bread-crumbs and either slightly damped with water or with potato crushed
through a masher; to this a little hard-boiled egg or preserved egg-flake was
added. Fruit of course was given daily.
The fits are due to overheated blood rushing to the head, and the quickest
remedy is to plunge the bird's head into cold water for a second ; but an aperient
should be given, the best in my opinion is two drops of castor oil which can
either be dropped into the back of the bird's mouth, or be administered by
dipping a good-sized camel's-hair brush into the oil and inserting it in the open
mouth. A. G. Butler.

SIR, - What do Bullfinches eat ? The R.S.P.C.A. says they only eat buds
that contain insects. This has not been my experience.
A lady somewhere stated that hers ate invisible insects. I remember this
but cannot trace it at the moment. How did she know it ? A Bullfinch I have
now eats mealworms and wireworms before the other birds can get at them. Is
not this unusual ? Books do not seem to refer to their taking animal food.
A Magpie Mannikin I bred last year has, during the winter, moulted
practically all its white feathers and replaced them with black. Is this often
done? H. A. SOAMES.

Correspondence.
The following reply has been sent to Air. Soames : --
Bullfinches eat the fruit-buds of cherry, plum, apple, pear, gooseberry and
currant without troubling as to whether they contain maggots or not ; they do
not eat leaf buds, seeming to prefer the stouter and more succulent fruit-buds.
Possibly this indiscriminate pruning may strengthen the trees, but it is a
source of great irritation to the fruit-grower.
In addition no doubt these birds eat many seeds of noxious weeds, as well
as green fly, small caterpillars and, in the autumn, berries ; they will possibly
eat wireworms in a wild state when they get a chance to do so, as it is well-
known that they and their allies like mealworms when captive.
I never heard of a Magpie Mannikin replacing its white feathers by
black, but the Java Sparrow, after a fight in which the white face patches have
been pulled out replaces them by black ; this however only happens in the breed-
ing season when fighting is prevalent amongst many birds (I had one instance in
my own aviaries). Why white feathers should be replaced by black during the
winter I don't understand. &amp;apos; A. G. BUTLER.

DESTRUCTIVE WARFARE AMONG PARROTS.

SIB,--In the interesting article by Lord Tavistock in the April, 1915,
number of the Avicultural Magazine, the question is asked whether this des-
tructive warfare goes on among parrots in Australia. Personally, in all my
wanderings in this country, I have never seen a sample of it. The birds here
have ample room, far more than they would have at Woburn Abbey, also hollows
in trees are very much more plentiful than in the European trees, and therefore
I do not think they would ever have to fight for the possession of a nesting-hole.
Nesting parrots have their difficulties, but I do not think that is one of them.
D. Le Souef,
Director of Royal Zoological Society of Victoria.
SlE,--There has been a scandal in my aviary. A pair of Red-faced Love-
birds were a most loving couple (like all cock Lovebirds he was rather henpecked,
but that they seem to expect). They were never more than a foot or so apart
and generally squeezed tight against each other--an exemplary pair. Then I
introduced a yellow hen Budgerigar because I had an odd cock one, but he died
the next day I think, still there were others and she reared a family in which
the Lovebird took a great interest, and when they left the nest he forsook his
wife and took up with the yellow lady, and now he spends all the day gazing into
the hole in her cocoa-nut, keeping strict guard and particularly savage with his
wife if she comes near, yet oddly enough they sleep huddled together at night in
the old way. There are young birds in the nest I think and I am anxious to see
the result, though I fear I did not remove the other Budgerigars soon enough.
Has a cross ever been reared I wonder ? I am told Red-faced Lovebirds will not
breed in outdoor aviaries ; is it true ? A. A. THOM.

We are indebted to some primitive aviculturist for our earliest
knowledge of the handsome Vulturine Guinea-fowl. The first re-
corded specimen was brought from the West Coast by Captain
Probyn, and had been kept in captivity, as its damaged wings and
tail testified. The new bird was exhibited by Captain Stoddart
at a meeting of the Zoological Society on June 23rd, 1834, and
was afterwards deposited in the " Naval and Military Museum."
Although the specimen was imperfect, and had also died in moult,
its unique character rendered it valuable : for many years it re-
mained the only example in any collection. In 1861 it was pur-
chased by the Trustees of the British Museum.
On May 26th, 1863, the Hamburg Zoological Gardens were
opened: the Vulturine Guinea-fowls exhibited there were probably
the first seen alive in Europe, several being shown in the menagerie
during the first nine years of its existence. In 1870 Sir John Kirk
sent to the London Zoo. a single female, which had been captured at
Brava in Somaliland. This individual was in a very weak state,
and very thin : it only lived about ten days. A companion shipped
with it had died on the way to Marseilles. The Zoological Society
made a special grant to Sir John Kirk, to enable him to obtain the
Vulturine Guinea-fowl and other desirable birds. In June, 1872,
he presented a fine pair to the same collection, and two more birds
in January, 1874. In 1877, Mr. Gerald Walker deposited in the
Zoo. several rare guinea-fowl, including two of the Vulturine species,

Dr. Bernard E. Potter,
and gradually these most desirable birds became known to avicul-
ture. To-day they can be seen in any Zoo. of any size, as they
are frequently imported.
Mr. J. C. Parr was probably the first to breed the Vulturine
Guinea-fowl. In August, 1884, a bird in his possession laid a clutch
of six eggs, which she endeavoured to hatch, but died after sitting
for a week. The eggs were put under a hen, and five nestlings
resulted. One of these, which had died on October 15th, was
exhibited by Dr. Sclater at a meeting of the Zoological Society ; it
is probably the specimen recorded in the British Museum Catalogue
as having been received from Dr. Sclater. The Vulturine Guinea-
fowl also breeds with the common species (Numicla meleagris ) : a
hybrid between these was presented to the Zoo, by Mr. J. M.
Comely on November 25th, 1878.
The head of a vulture on the body of a game bird would
arrest the attention of the most unobservant; but in spite of its
quaint appearance the present species is very beautiful. The small
bare head is delicately set on the slender neck; the throat and
shoulders are adorned with long pointed hackles ; the tail is elon-
gated and somewhat pointed. The bright scarlet eye is charmingly
set off by the cobalt-blue neck; the plumage is black or blackish,
minutely seeded over with white dots. The Vulturine Guinea-fowl
is a peaceful inhabitant of the aviary, and easily acclimatised.
This species occasionally harbours parasites. The nematode
worm (Ascaris cornelyi ) was first known from an individual taken
from the small intestine of one of these birds.

Although our unit has been here since January, I have
received regularly each number of the Avicultural Magazine. In
the April one, I think, was a note of swallows having been seen
north of Ypres as early as the 25th of March. The place men-
tioned I believe was Lizerne. Like several other places mentioned
in the official maps for our use in this campaign, Lizerne does not

appear to be recognised by the natives. However, while riding with
my C. 0., within half-a-mile of that place, I saw at a farm in
Zuydschoote, two swallows on the 28th of March, only three days
later than the above date. These were skimming close to the
water, the usual pool which one finds near these Flemish farms.
At that time one could go no further east for the French guns were
posted in the vicinity. Since then the Germans broke through in
the second famous attempt to possess Ypres.
Though this country is so small a distance from our own
there afppear to be many birds here which one does not see at
home. Unfortunately, being without books of reference, I can
only make drawings and mental notes and not give the names of
new kinds whose notes I have learnt.
On arrival at Strazeele in January I was struck by the
frequency of a bird resembling our own sparrow. The first thing
noticed was a whitish ring round the neck, then a dark patch
on the cheek. I know of the Mountain sparrow only from books,
hut do not remember the white collar. This white collar does not
extend to the nape. The bird is smaller than our sparrow, its
markings a lighter and more uniform brown. The sexes are similar.
The note is softer. At a chateau at Herzeele, where our unit was at
rest, I could watch a pair building a nest at the back of an opened
shutter.
The blackcap warbler appears to be common in the woods
over here, at least I have never seen so many before. The first I
noticed was in the trees that adorn the walks upon the battle-
ments which surround Ypres on all except its north side. This
walk reveals beautiful scenery. Ypres is now a heap of ruins, but
its splendid battlements will always remain to remind one of its
antiquity and its wealth. The rampart is bounded by the ancient
wall at least three feet in thickness, and outside and far below is
the wide moat. I enjoyed listening to the blackcap, and felt
annoyed when at one time it was chased away by a pugnacious
robin.
In the moat are numerous moorhens, who paddle about
quite oblivious to the sound of heavy guns. Indeed, even when
German high explosives burst in the field only 200 yards away

Dr. Bernard E. Potter,
searching for our well-concealed battery, the birds went on their own
way. Kingfishers were also to be seen. On one occasion it was
a curious contrast to hear a robin singing while the guns were
firing and creating a great din. But one day, almost the last one
permissible in that doomed city, I disturbed a cowering cock pheasant
in the undergrowth, this bird had evidently flown from the country
over the moat to escape the guns.
Nightingales are very common as with us round London,
but perhaps I have had more leisure to observe them.
Blackbirds have sung lustily all the months we have been in
Flanders : in one camp every morning above my tent I heard a per-
sistent warbler, but like the Editor,who is surrounded by birds in the
moat, I am not disturbed at night or early morning by their voices.
It has always seemed curious to me that I have hardly
heard any thrushes at all in song ; whereas I have notes at home
to prove that hardly a month of the year passes but they can be
heard in Hyde Park.
Magpies are very numerous over here ; especially have I
seen them along the now famous Ypres Canal on the way towards
Boesinghe to the north. This broad canal has very high banks,
along which is a fringe of lofty black poplars. In the heights of
these trees the deeply made nests are plainly visible. One day in
the trees I counted as many as eighteen birds, and near by on the
ground twenty-four on another occasion. To see such numbers
seems to me phenomenal, for one generally thinks of these birds
as being solitary in habits rather than gregarious. Among the
Flemish they have a bad name as noted pilferers. In the spring
they arrive in large flocks and alight upon the fields to eat up
the newly-sown grain. In the autumn they fly southward to
escape the winter. In their flight the people tell me they form
the shape of letter M with one bird in advance who is called the
king. Perhaps if the war still lasts I may be able to verify this.
While in camp before Christmas at Maresfield Park, Sussex,
I was greatly interested one day to observe black and grey birds
which were new to me, but one recognised that they must be
hooded crows. However, on reaching the neighbourhood of Ypres
I at once found these birds to be quite numerous, and there have

been many opportunities of watching them as they are very tame.
The hooded crows were nearly always seen with rooks, but not, as
far as I could judge, with carrion crows.
While strolling one morning in a meadow, in front of the
new asylum of Ypres, where the round shell holes could be counted
by the dozen and enough pieces of the blue shell picked up to satisfy
the greediest souvenir hunter, I thought myself lucky to see a pair
of buntings alight on some rushes, both of a sandy-brown colour and
the male with a black head and "bib." * I could get near enough
to make a rapid sketch for future reference. In the same meadow a
solitary green woodpecker appeared from time to time and seemed
very tame. His laugh might be often heard. In that flat non-
woody land he appeared quite out of place. In the Asylum grounds
a small flock of goldfinches could be watched feeding generally on
the flowering groundsel. These birds are by the French poetically
called "les favoris dela nature" for their song and beautiful plumage.
Before the second bombardment of Ypres in April, Jackdaws
might be seen about the ruined summit of St. Martin's Cathedral
and the adjoining solitary pinnacle of the once great tower of the
Cloth Hall. They seemed quite at home and the occasional shelling
did not disturb them. Starlings are common enough everywhere,
but I have not noticed them near the guns as has one observer who
wrote in the magazine. However, my observations were neces-
sarily cut short in April and early May by the excessive work with
the wounded during that terrible time when the Germans got round
our left. Twice was I shelled out of advanced dressing stations to
the east of Ypres.
Now I must say a word about the chaffinch, so much sought
after by the French and Belgians. Everywhere one can hear their
joyous song with its cadence and finished ending. ' Gai comme
un pierrot," as is the French saying, is apt enough. But what words
can describe the horror felt when I discovered the treatment that
is meted out to these poor birds. It is long known that birds can
be taught to sing better in the dark. Thus the bullfinch is taught
to sing in the darkness when it can listen undisturbed to an air
repeatedly ground out. Boiler canaries are taught a soft note under

the same conditions by a clock-like machine. But the French, to
attain this end, actually sear the chaffinch's eyes with a hot wire
and pretend that they can then sing more loudly.* At Herzeele, north
of Hazebrouck, I noticed three terribly mutilated in this way, and
living in small dingy and dirty cages. It was marvellous how they
could still exist. Their loud song was to me very pathetic as they
answered one another and could at least enjoy full range of hearing.
One bird I was told had gained prizes for its song. However, to a
room full of friendly enough folk, I felt impelled to hold forth on
the terrible cruelty, in the best French I could command.
Perhaps another digression will be permitted. One observes
in the farms a very large proportion of cocks among the fowls. This
puzzled me at first, till one Sunday I happened to visit an aged
woman of 102 years at Hooggraaf, south of Poperinghe. Here I
noticed in this out-of-the-way hamlet an unusual stir, then I saw
a Flemish soldier adjusting artificial spurs quite two inches long
over the natural ones of a powerful cock by binding them cleverly
on with rubber. It was evident a concours was awaited, and this
I was told would take but three minutes. This I found was true,
though I did not witness it. This practice is defendu in Belgium,
though not in France. The familiar and picturesque garde cham-
petre would not dare to suppress it!
I would like to add a few notes of other birds I have seen.
Greenfinches and yellow-hammers are very common and sing all
day. Willow wrens are heard in all the high trees of the woods,
no bird's note was more welcome this spring with its gentle cadence.
I have seen many pied wagtails, only one Pay's. Of the tits the
great tit is much in evidence, but none of the others. Wrens are
very numerous and sometimes seem to predominate as singers. So
vociferous a song from so small a bird always seems extraordinary.
Usually they sing at the end of a house-roof and their profile with
the well-cocked tail is most comical. While shells were falling
with regularity, yet I could not help noticing a wren in this typical
pose on an estaminet at Potijze. We had established here an
advanced dressing-station, one mile east of Ypres, and had shortly
after to evacute it as the Germans had the range. Nettle-creepers

are quite common, and their throaty voice and alarm note are always
pleasant to hear. Of tree-creepers I have only seen two, but how
fascinating they are to watch with their striped brown plumage !
In England many bird-lovers have to record and regret the absence
of swallows and house martins. Here it is refreshing to see so
many making use of the well-sheltered eaves of the scattered
Flemish homesteads, nor do they appear to be bullied by the spar-
rows as is so often the case in England. Cuckoos were heard
frequently six weeks ago, and I managed to get close under one
and watch its contortions unobserved at each vocal effort; later
on I did not hear or see any. Larks are very numerous ; one
morning while riding out early I saw a strangely light-coloured
bird, this turned out to be a lark, almost an albino.
I might have mentioned before that one of our men who
had lain between our own and the German trenches dangerously
wounded in the abdomen for some hours before he could be moved
from such a perilous position, reported that he had noticed the birds
flying about near by and even building their nests in the bushes ;
and that he also saw rabbits feeding. All these wild things had
become quite used to the crack of rifles and explosion of shells.
MR. HEUMANN'S AVIARIES AT
BEECROFT, N.S.W.
[The Australian Naturalist gave this account by Mr. G. D. Stead,
in the July number, 1914, of one of our member's aviaries and
birds.]
Saturday , February, 1914.
Great interest was manifested by a large number of members
of the Society, who had the privilege of seeing Mr. G. A. Heumann's
rich collection of living Australian and exotic birds, in his fine
aviaries at Beecroft. The great variety of seed-eating birds in this
collection alone, would make a very remarkable assemblage ; but
what surprises the visitor most, is the unique collection of insec-
tivorous, frugivorous, and other birds, many of which need so much
attention, and necessitate the preparation of strange and special
foods. I would fain touch upon the latter in some detail, but space

Mr. G. D. Stead,
at present forbids, as I wish to deal mainly here with the kinds of
Australian birds that were to be seen on this one occasion.
Among the exotic birds were gaudy Macaws from South
America, the remarkable Kagu (Cagou) from New Caledonia, won-
derful weavers of several species, the beautiful shining starlings
from Africa, Californian quail (including a clutch of 10 young), and
many others.
It is the birds of Australia that claim our attention, however,
and as most of the species represented had never before been seen at
close quarters in the living state by many of those present, I here
append a full list, as at the date mentioned above :--

Many of the birds in the foregoing list are naturally shy
in the extreme, and the observer who walks in Mr. Heumann's
roomy aviaries will perhaps find himself puzzling over three things :
(1) How it was possible to capture such birds : (2) How they are
so readily tamed; and (3) How is it possible to satisfactorily feed,
while in a state of captivity, such tender, wild things. Such birds
as the glorious little Blood-bird, or Sanguineous honey eater, the
dainty little mistletoe-bird and the handsome ciested shrike-tit
would appear to be particularly difficult to catch as well as to main-
tain alive after capture. These, and nearly all the others, are caught
with bird-lime in their native haunts, usually at feeding or drinking-
places, frequently after many hours of patient search and waiting.
It is in the pursuit of such birds that the finest instincts of the
bush-naturalist are developed, and where observations of habits are
made that would never otherwise be recorded. As far as the taming
process is concerned, I can personally testify in a small way, to
what Mr. Heumann and other keepers of our wild birds have found,
that when treated in an attentive and affectionate manner, while
suitably housed, they become quite tame very rapidly indeed. In
the present case Mr. Heumann has taught his feathered pets to love
him, and it is a pretty sight, indeed, to see typical wild bush-birds,
like the wood swallows and whistlers (Thickheads) coming, when

called, and perching on their friend's head, or flying past and swoop-
ing down to take the proffered grub or crumb.
One often hears it said that our Australian birds cannot be
kept satisfactorily in captivity. The imposing list of " soft-billed "
birds alone, given above, is a sufficient answer; but in the aviaries
under discussion, the term captivity must be understood in quite a
relative sense: so great is the freedom of the birds, that even the
most sensitive objector to the caging of wild birds could find little to
hurt his feelings here.
Space forbids that I should dwell more upon this subject, but
I would like to refer to two observations made by Mr. Heumann--
one relating to the olive-backed oriole, and the other to the satin
bower-bird. It was noted that when the oriole was suffering from
the fright of capture (whether by lime or net), the very pronounced
red colour of the eyes was immediately lost, leaving a pallid white,
which, of course, quite altered the appearance of the bird Eecently
he caught a pair which he had and sent them to the Sydney Zoo.
Upon capture the red colour disappeared, as when they were first
captured : but this was immediately restored when they were put
into the large enclosure at the Zoo. The satin bower birds are
said to have a decided penchant for the colour of blue, both in the
aviary and in a wild state, decorating their bowers or playgrounds
with any fragments of blue cloth, paper, or china, etc., or flowers, if
available. Mr. Heumann says he has invariably found the bowers
in a state of Nature, decorated specially with one small blue flower.
The irides of this bird are of a blue colour, and it is suggested that
perhaps this preference, if such really exists throughout the species,
is due to the fact that their mates' eyes are blue.
In this connection it is w T orthv of note that a bower, described
by Leach in p. 185 of his " Australian Bird Book," was decorated
with blue flowers from the school garden, pieces of blue paper, blue
hair-ribbon, besides blue parrot's feathers. Campbell, in his " Nests
and Eggs of Australian Birds," p. 193 (footnote), says: " Mr. I. W.
De Lany informs me that he has only noticed blue feathers at
bowers. His wife, by way of experiment, put out several pieces of
coloured wools near the house, and only the blue ones were taken
to the bower."

A quotation which the same author makes from the MS. of
Herman Law, in regard to the occurrence of the bird in Southern
Queensland, seems to indicate that the habit is not quite universal,
because bowers are there mentioned as being decorated with "Yellow
and blue Lory Parrots' feathers," etc.
This bower-bird's liking for blue is evidently well established,
however, and is worthy of attention.

By Richard Staples-Browne.
I have come across some rough notes on birds, scribbled in a
Baedeker, during a cruise in the Fiords in August 1912. They are
a pleasant reminder of the species which I happened to see during
the few days I was in Norwegian waters. The country is, doubt-
less, well-known to a very large number of our members, and, since
the Editor and Council appeal for " copy" even of a trivial nature,
I venture to publish the notes in the hope that they may remind
others of their own rambles.
A " yachting cruise de luxe," although a popular and enjoy-
able way of spending a few days in the summer, scarcely gives
opportunities for learning much about the country, inhabitants, or
fauna. In this case nine days only were spent in Norway, including
one in the town of Bergen, and, as the steamer stopped at seventeen
places, the time allowed at each was naturally very limited. I
returned to England with a great desire to see Norway more
thoroughly, which, up to the present I have been unable to gratify.
On the outward journey, from Leith to Aalesund, the North
Sea was remarkable only for rough weather and a strong head wind
which delayed us considerably. On the Bass Rock there were, as
usual, a large quantity of gannets and a few herring gulls, the
latter keeping together by themselves. The ship was followed by
herring gulls, lesser black-backs, and kittiwakes, but only the
herring gulls were visible during the second day of the voyage.
On the return, from Sundal to Grimsby, we crossed the Dogger
Bank, steaming through the fishing fleet. Here a shag accompanied
us for some little distance, and herring gulls were visible all day.

Mr. Richard Staple s-Browne,
As we neared Aalesund at noon on August 13th, several
lesser black-backs and some guillemots were visible, and, at some
little distance, I saw eight ducks, .but I was not near enough to
distinguish the species. In the afternoon we landed and climbed
the Axla, a small hill with a very extensive view. Here we found
several flocks of twites and a fine raven.
The next morning we found ourselves at Aandalsnaes on
the Romsdalsfjord. Here the lesser black-backs and herring gulls
were accompanied by several common gulls. After breakfast an
excursion was made by carriage up the Romsdal Valley as far as
Horgheim. The valley is extremely picturesque, and for the most
part well wooded, and is flanked by several noble peaks, among them
Romsdalslrorn and Troldtinder. White wagtails were very numerous,
especially at Horgheim, where I saw several young birds. The
hooded crow was very conspicuous, and once I saw a raven. There
were several swallows and blackbirds, and in a silver birch wood a
noisy fieldfare attracted my attention. Bramblings were common
in the valley, and at Horgheim I was pleased to see a siskin.
On rejoining the ship we returned to Molde where we arrived
about six o&amp;apos;clock. Here we saw several common terns, also a dark
skua, probably Richardson's. Fourteen diving ducks were visible
at some distance. On landing we ascended to the Reckneshaugen, a
wooded park, from which a most magnificent view of the Moldefjord
is obtained. Several house martins were flying about the town.
At eight o'clock on the morning of the 15th we anchored at
Oje at the head of the Norangfjord. Several gulls were flying
round the ship, including the common gull. Our stay here was
very brief, and, after leaving, we steamed through the Norangfjord,
one of the most remarkable in Norway for the beauty of its mountain
scenery. On the bank I saw a sandpiper. Curiously enough, with
the exception of a heron, this was the only wading bird I caught
sight of during the whole cruise. The Norangfjord leads into the
Jorundfjord where we again enjoyed most superb scenery. In the
afternoon we arrived at Hellesylt to pick up passengers who had
driven overland from Oje, and then entered the Geirang&amp;apos;erfjord,
remarkable for its beautiful waterfalls, and at three o'clock anchored
at Marok.

We landed here, and climbed, as far as time would permit,
towards the Geiranger basin. Yellow-hammers and bramblings
were common here, and we saw a fine ring ouzel; also a beautiful
specimen of the blue-throated warbler, a bird common in Norway,
but this was the only occasion on which I came across it.
We landed at Olden on the following morning and found
cariols waiting to take us to the Olden Lake. These local convey-
ances are drawn by rough little cream-coloured ponies, on whose
legs may often be seen zebra markings. Arrived at the lake we took
a launch to Rustoen, whence other cariols took us to the famous
Brigsdals Glacier. On the lake I saw three young widgeon, and
later a pair of black-throated divers. On the return journey I saw
a duck with five young. Unfortunately they dived before I could
distinguish whether it was a red-breasted merganser or a goosander,
and, although two of the young ones came up quite close to the boat,
I never saw the old one again. At the glacier, hooded crows were
much in evidence, also swallows and blackbirds. The extreme
tameness of the white wagtail in Norway is very noticeable. It is
present in every village street. The room in which we lunched at
the Brigsdals-Gaarde swarmed with flies, and it was most amusing
to watch the efforts of these birds to catch them through the glass
of the sky-light.
As we approached Mundal the next morning three ducks
swam quickly away. I landed and walked along the wooded banks
of a small stream. Here I found fieldfares and blackbirds, also
several bramblings and a good many whinchats. The swallow
was common and also the Marsh tit, but whether the northern
form or not I could not tell. The corn stacks attracted a large
number of yellowhammers and some ortolans. Late in the after-
noon we arrived at Balholmen and walked up the Essefjord. Here
a Greater black-backed gull took possession of our ship, driving
away all intruders, of whom there were very few. Some gannets
flew over at a great height.
Early in the morning of the 18th we were in the Naerofjord,
another most beautiful spot surrounded by mountains. We landed
at Gudvangen, and drove up the wild valley of the Naerodal. Some
fine salmon were visible in the river. At the end of the valley is

Stalheims-Klev, a steep rock about 800 feet high, up which we
climbed by a zigzag path. Here I saw some young robins and a
siskin, but the most remarkable feature of the bird-life of the cliff
was the enormous quantity of magpies there. I counted seventeen
visible at one time at the top, and we passed several others on the
way up and down.
We spent the following day in Bergen, and on the morning
of the 20th called at Tysse on our way to the well-known Hardan-
gerfjord. In this fjord I saw five porpoises. Among birds I noticed
a gannet, a Greater black-backed gull, some common terns and a
skua. Also I saw three Red-throated divers at noon. The herring
gulls here were remarkable for their large size. We touched at
Norheimsund in the afternoon, and in the evening arrived at Sundal,
where I noticed a heron.
Our last day in Norway was spent at Odda, whence we drove
to the Lotefos, a grand waterfall. The road passed by Sandven
Lake on which was a large flock of young Lesser black-backs,
swallows and martins were present. There were several hooded
crows and many magpies, but here I only counted six together at
one time. Once I heard the note of a jay.
I must not conclude this account without a brief reference
to the magnificent collection of Norwegian birds in the Museum
at Bergen. The line series of nutcrackers and w 7 axwings attract
the eye, also the eiders and King eiders. There are some nice
specimens of the Snowy owl and the Ivory gull, also a beautiful
series of Norwegian Game birds, including some interesting hybrids.
Mention of Game birds reminds me that never during my stay in
Norway did I see one alive. Possibly they were on the high fjeld
with the Elk, which a local sportsman informed me are " always
upstairs in August."

BIRDS.
By Gerald Rattigan.
I have just read Dr. Lovell-Keays' interesting article on the
above subject and should like to offer a few remarks upon it.
To begin with, I must frankly state that I do not at all agree
with his deductions ; and his experience, as will appear hereafter, is
utterly opposed to mine. His first contention, that birds do better
and live longer in cages than in aviaries, is an extremely sweeping
statement, to say the least of it, and one open to a good deal of
criticism. In one respect no doubt it is true enough, that is to say,
that if it were intended to exhibit a bird it would undoubtedly be
the wisest and safest plan to cage it up separately, though at the
same time I have personally successfully shown birds, both British
and foreign, taken about a week or ten days before the Show straight
from flying loose in an aviary.
There is of course always an element of danger to birds of a
mixed series flying loose together in a limited space ; but when
suitable cover is provided and dangerous species and individuals are
eliminated at once from the association of weaker species, this
danger is not a very serious one.
The casualties that result in a carefully associated mixed
collection are almost entirely confined to young birds that have
just left the nest, a few such as this it is almost impossible to
prevent, entirely owing to their own indiscretions and folly. They
appear to have no sense of danger and will frequently fly bang into
another bird's nest, promptly paying the penalty. Apart from these
occasional accidents, however, I see no reason whatever why a bird
should not live just as long in a well looked after aviary as in a cage.
Certain species indeed, in my experience at all events, do far better
and live much longer in large aviaries than in cages, in which latter
they frequently soon succumb.
As an example of this type of bird, I will take the Parrot-
finches. These are extremely nervous birds, and more often than
not fret themselves to death in a cage within a few weeks or even
days of their being placed in it, though they may have lived for

Mr. Gerald Rattigan,
several months and even years in perfect health in an aviary. This
I have more than once abundantly proved, as I have the fact that
they will keep perfectly fit and well in all weathers and seasons in
an open unheated aviary with merely an open shelter to retire into
when so inclined. On the other hand, I quite admit that there are
undoubtedly some species which do not do well in open aviaries, not
only in the winter, however, but at any period of the year.
An example of these species is the " Cordon Bleu." These
birds I have always found extremely delicate and almost impossible
to bring safely through damp, wet winters (in an open aviary) such
as we usually get, owing to the fact that they will persist in roosting
out in the open, unless prevented from doing so. The consequence
being that even in summer I have frequently picked up dead or half-
dead cordon bleus after a severe thunderstorm during the night, the
birds being literally almost drowned.
While it is not my intention to compile a list of those birds
which can and those which cannot be left in an open unheated aviary
throughout the year I will just mention a few examples of both
species that occur to me at the moment.

I transferred the birds--a list of which I will give later on--
from my London aviaries to the aviary, (a description of which
follows), about the middle of April, 1914.
The aviary in question was constructed for me locally by the
village carpenter and was a very rough affair, yet, in so far as the
health of the inmates was concerned, it answered admirably. The
flight measured 20ft. by 20ft. by 7ft. and the shelter 8ft. by 4ft. by
7ft. The shelter, a roofed hut, as it were, has three entrances, one
at each end, and one on one side. One end entrance has a door,
with a square of glass in the upper part to let in the light. Opposite
this, at the other end, there is a small wooden flap, which is kept
closed during the winter, but open in spring and summer. Another
entrance, on one side, is entirely open in summer, but in winter is
covered, save for about a foot at the bottom, with tarred felt.
There is no floor to the shelter and no heat whatever is supplied at
any season.
In order to encourage the birds to use the shelter, two dishes
of food--one containing seed and the other soft-food--are always
placed inside the open side entrance just referred to. In this shelter
I arrange each spring quantities of brushwood, in which I fix huge
bundles of heather, bracken, ivy, etc. Another heap of brushwood
furnished as before is placed just outside the shelter by the wooden
flap and is sheltered from the rain partly by overhanging eaves, but
the wire-netting&amp;apos; above it is also covered over with tarpaulin wired to
the top.
It is always most important to provide a perfectly dry place
of some kind or other where the birds can and will go to roost. I
am satisfied that it is the wetting they get at night through roosting
out in the open that does all the damage. The shelter itself is not
constructed with the idea of warmth so much as with the idea of
keeping out wind and rain, especially the latter. Contrary to Dr.
Lovell-Keays' experience, practically every bird in the aviary uses
this shelter to roost in. Some only use it in rough weather, others
use it habitually and even nest therein. At the present moment
for instance (June) a pair of Virginian cardinals are incubating their
second clutch in the shelter, and a pair of bullfinches have also
nested and laid there, though incubation has not yet actually been

Mr. Gerald Battigan,
commenced. Last year, both Cuban and parrot finches nested in
this shelter.
The only birds, of all those mentioned below, that did not to
my knowledge use the shelter on any occasion were the red-billed
weavers and the cordon bleus. Providing the shelter is made
comfortable for the birds and food is placed in it to encourage them
to use it, I do not believe there would ever be the slightest difficulty
in inducing most species to use it, and those that did not could be
easily caught up and placed either in cages or a closed-in shelter till
the winter was past.
At Brockenhurst, where I was during 191.4, the aviary con-
tained no large shrubs of any kind, so that the birds were forced to
either roost in the shelter or in the pile of brushwood, both of
which were under cover. This year, however, chiefly for ornamental
reasons, I put in some thick fir and other hardy shrubs. As an ex-
periment I shall leave these in this winter, though I very much fear
their presence will prove detrimental to the birds' welfare, owing to
the fact that, though they afford practically no protection from a
continuous damp spell, the birds, or many of them, seem to prefer
roosting in them to roosting in the other and far safer places I have
provided. Small shrubs, etc., in an aviary undoubtedly improve its
appearance, and are moreover no doubt very much appreciated by
the birds themselves ; they may also increase the prospects of a
successful nesting season, though, unless the aviary is converted into
a small plantation, this I very much doubt; but although up till
now I have had no opportunity of actually proving my theory,
I most certainly, rightly or wrongly, attribute the heavy casualty
lists that appear to occur with some regularity in many otherwise
far more perfect and elaborate aviaries than mine has any claim to
be, to the presence of these shrubs, which I believe to be veritable
death traps during cold and inclement weather, especially to the
smaller finches and waxbills.
I will conclude with a list of the birds I placed in the aviary
I have described at Brockenhurst in April, 1914.
Breeding results, thanks to the activities of field mice, were
poor, and all the young actually bred were either sold or exchanged
for other birds, so are not entered on the list, nor are the few birds

tained in flying against wire-
netting).
When I can say that I left Brockenhurst on the last day of
February, 1915, with every bird mentioned above except those
bracketed as having been either sold or as having succumbed, I
think this fact will form the best argument to Dr. Lovell-Keays'
contentions.
During all this time, except once for a period of three days,
the birds were fed and looked after solely by myself, and this fact
may have something to do with my success in keeping them prac-
tically without a loss throughout the winter, which by the way was
an extremely wet one.
On my arrival here I had many vexatious and costly losses
whilst my aviary was being put up, owing to the fact I had nowhere
to house the birds except a terribly draughty and not even rainproof
conservatory. Then, as Dr. Lovell-Keays would say, it was a case
of picking up two or three dead birds every morning, and, amongst
others, I unhappily lost the following :--

The only losses so far have been the cock Saffron finch
(killed I think by one of the bulbuls), a very old bird; he shared
the distinction of being with the cock Madagascar weaver, one of
my two first purchases on commencing to keep foreign birds : this
was on 8th August, 1908. The other loss, the two hen canaries
were both killed on their nests the same morning by the peach-
faced love birds, a recent purchase.

g IR; --i was interested to read Mr. Shore Bailey's remarks on my humble
efforts at writing. He is, I know, quite right. It is the relative proportion of
cover in the flight and shelter that determines a bird's choice of a roosting-
place. I discovered that soon after writing the article. But so many avicul-
turists have found the same difficulty, and perhaps here is the solution, or
partial solution, at any rate.
There is another point I should like to refer to and that is apropos of
catching mice. Last winter and spring I caught very nearly 250 , and to the
best of my knowledge and belief entirely cleared some of my aviaries of mice.
I used the ordinary break-neck traps baited with cheese and I have never ex-
perienced the smallest difficulty in catching them. To protect the traps I used
to put a box over them with half an inch cut off two opposite ends so that mice
could run in and out. Then place three or four traps under the box and where
the mice run and you cannot help catching them. I have caught fifteen in one
night, and for weeks I averaged six or eight. In a month's time I had for all
intents and purposes exterminated the little beasts. I don't doubt I have a few
now, but I am quite sure not many. If I see any signs I at once lay a trap and
almost invariably succeed in catching my friend the first night. I had two
disasters,--both due to insufficient care, one was a cock firefinch and the
other a hen reedling. L. LOVELL-KEAYS.

SlR ) --In answer to Mr. Le Souef, I should rather like to say that my
parrakeets did not appear to fight for nesting places, as the majority of fatal
battles took place at a distance from the most favoured breeding resort of the
combatants ; birds were sometimes killed out of the breeding season altogether.
The fact that I kept birds together which may not meet in a wild state might
have had something to do with it, for it used to be members of different species,
not of the same species, which killed one another. I am also tempted to think
that the birds were so quarrelsome, not because they were overcrowded, but for
the opposite reason, because they were comparatively few. It certainly seems to
be the case that members of certain pugnacious species of birds and beasts fight
less savagely, when, from natural or artificial causes, they are compelled to see a
great deal of their rivals, without, however, being in so confined a space that
they are able to overtake and kill them. The mute swan, for example, is seldom
satisfied with less than a mile of river or a whole lake when he and his mate are
thinking of a nest and all rivals are either killed or driven away. But at
Abbotsbury, where hundreds of swans are kept together, you may see them
nesting within a few yards of each other in comparative amity.

This bird, probably one of the most beautiful of the touracos,
is very common in the wooded parts of Uganda, and its resounding
notes make the forest ring. It usually goes about in flocks of from
eight to a dozen, always keeping in high trees. I have never seen
one on the ground. Their running and jumping up branches of trees
are very characteristic. When flying they go in a string with a
considerable interval between the individuals. Their flights are
never very prolonged as far as I have observed, just from one
patch of forest to the next, say a quarter of a mile at the outside.
The leader leaves the top of his tree and enters the next tree about
half way up and then his running and jumping starts till he is at
the top of this tree, whence he flies off again, the others following
in turn.
Though I have never come across the nest, it is, I understand,
usually not very high, like a pigeon's nest, and often in a single tree,
not in forest. A friend of mine tells me that August is the month
to expect to find them. If this is so it would appear that they have
two nesting seasons, as a young one was brought to me, evidently
having fallen from its nest, on February 23rd this year. I gave the
boy a rupee for it and told him to go and look for the nest and bring
the other one and I would give him another rupee ; but he never
went.
When the nestling arrived it was very small but covered
with down, except the head which was quite bald; the tail was

very short, the wings and feathers were dark blue and well de-
veloped, the breast black, and the beak was very large. At a first
glance, in the boy's hand, I thought it was a young porphyrio, as
the boy said it had come from near the lake ; however, on taking
it in my hand I soon saw my mistake.
I fed it entirely on fruit, with now and then insects, larvae,
etc. At first it seemed particularly fond of a forest fruit, like a large
damson ; later these were difficult to get and I tried bananas, pine
apple, pawpaw, but it did not care for any of these, then guavas
came in and it quite liked these again, but they went off and I could
find nothing it really liked, also I had to leave it to the tender
mercies of a boy, only seeing it during week ends, till on the 25th of
July it died, after having been kept for just five months.
It proved a most delightfully tame bird and would sit quite
happily on my hand or shoulder, nibbling at my ear or hair while I
walked about the garden. One thing that struck me was the length
of time it took before it could fly, possibly it was weak from unsuit-
able food, but it could hop and climb long before it could fly and I
came to the conclusion that these birds leave the nest some time
before they can fly and keep among the thick leafy branches and
so escape observation. Although so common around here, I never
remember seeing any flying about except full-grown birds and my
tame bird, when it died, at least six months old, was only about
half-grown, with the colours just appearing on the underside. The
crest had grown but was only composed of long black feathers,
not the beautiful crest that the adult bird has.
The photographs show it at two months, three months, and
four months old, presuming it was one month old when brought to
me.

morning, now at about six o'clock, there is a little scratching noise
outside at the window, and on the blinds being raised " Little Peter,"
as we have named him, appears, fluttering against the panes, clinging
to the framework and perching on the open window, uttering his
little call note. There on the ilex tree sits the mate, and with her
sometimes a blackcap, who appears intent on getting the nuts for
himself without the trouble of going to the window for them, for he
watches, and when Peter has caught up his nut (a most dexterous
feat considering the size of his beak) the blackcap tit chases him
across the lawn. Whether he succeeds in robbing him of the nut
or not is not known, as we cannot follow. Meantime the mate flies
shyly to the window, quietly takes her nut and enjoys it on the ilex
tree, holding it in her claws like a crossbill holds a fir cone.
A few weeks ago she ceased coming, no doubt being occupied
with her nesting duties. But though Peter now takes the nuts from
the sill of a wide open window, with a human being standing there,
he will not come on to the hand. Once only, on a very cold, frosty
morning he ventured to seize a nut from my hand, but never since.
He expostulates with a loud " Tweet! Tweet! " if I persist in hold-
ing them, and comes on to the sill a little way off, but not on to the
hand nor even so far as the nuts held in the fingers. He rarely asks
me for nuts during the day, they seem to be a breakfast relish. The
blackcap tit has not been lately so Peter has the field to himself.
I have listened very carefully during the winter and early
spring to Peter's notes, and so far as I can make out he has about
seven different calls and the notes now are less clear and resonant
than in winter and have a sort of tiny whistling sound as if the
letter S were in them. I have wondered if perhaps he gets tired
with helping to feed his young ones and it affects his voice.
There are several blue tits in the garden, and they shout to
each other from the trees. One day a party of them flew on to an
ancient rose-tree--a " Maiden Blush " rose, bearing hundreds of
exquisite shell-like blooms in June--and the dash of blue-grey colour
in the old tree was a lovely little picture.

December, 1913. Copyrighted, 1913, by Lynds Jones. Read at the thirty-
first Annual Congress of the American Ornithologists' Union, New York
City, Nov. 11, 1913].
The experiments herein described were begun without intending
them to bear upon the question of the food naturally sought by the
ruby-throated humming bird (Archilochus colubris) ; the original
aim of the feeding was to attract the humming birds about the yard
in the hope that some time they would remain to nest there. The
experiments have been conducted on independent lines without
knowledge of any similar work that was being done by others until
the autumn of 1912, except in one instance, where special acknow-
ledgments are due to Miss Caroline G. Soule, of Brookline, Mass, who
in Bird Lore for October, 1900, described her success in feeding
humming birds from a vial, which she had placed in the heart of an
artificial trumpet flower made from Whatman paper and painted
with water colours. This suggestion of using artificial flowers was
taken, but more durable ones were made from white oilcloth, their
edges were stiffened with one strand of wire taken from picture cord,
and they were carefully painted with oil colours, the first to represent
a nasturtium and the second a tiger lily.
In August of 1907 upon the appearance of a humming bird
about our flowers the artificial nasturtium, tacked to a stick, was
placed near a clump of blooming phlox, and its bottle w T as filled with
a sirup made of granulated sugar dissolved in water. The next day a
female rubythroat was seen searching the depths of tiger lilies that
grew north of the house ; as she flew to the east of the house she was
instantly followed, and was seen drinking from the artificial flower
for the space of about a minute, after which she flew to a rosebush,
wiped her bill, and rested a brief time before flying away. This was
about noon. She returned at intervals of about a half hour for the
next three hours, then at 3.10 o'clock she came back to search quite
thoroughly the phlox blossoms, this being the first time she had paid

any attention to them after finding the sirup. Ten minutes later
she drank deeply from the bottle and was seen no more that day.
In this way began the feeding of the ruby-throated humming
birds, which has been continued each summer since 1907 with a vary-
ing number of birds. The first season it appeared that but a single
bird found the bottled sweets. Perhaps it was the same bird that
came the following summer, and was not joined by a second hum-
ming bird until the latter part of August. In 1909 the number was
gradually augmented until seven of these birds were present to-
gether. The following year there were days when again seven came
at one time ; since then four has been the largest number seen to-
gether.
The days and weeks are calm and quiet ones when a single
bird has the bottles to herself. More or less fighting ensues as soon
as another bird comes on the scene, and the tumult of battle in-
creases with each new arrival until the presence of six or seven of
these tiny belligerents makes the front yard appear like the staging of
a ballet. With clashing sounds and continuous squeaking cries they
chase each other about, often swinging back and forth in an arc of a
circle with a sort of pendulum like motion. Sometimes they clinch
and fall to the earth, where the struggle is continued for many
seconds. So jealous are they lest others share the sirup that they
seem more anxious to fight than to drink. When seven are present
they are very difficult to count, and appear to be threefold that
number. We have read accounts of 40 or 100 humming birds
hovering about a tree or bush. That these numbers must clearly
have been estimates, probably large ones, too, anyone must believe
who has made sure that only seven birds have created the maze
of wonderful and beautiful motion in which there seemed to be a
dozen or a score of participants.
The number of bottles in use has been sufficient on most days
to satisfy the needs of all the humming birds present. Bach new
bottle has been added by way of an experiment. The first one was
placed in an artificial flower painted to imitate a nasturtium, mainly
yellow in color ; the second flower in form and color closely resem-
bled a tiger lily. The experiment with the yellow and the red flowers
was to test a supposedly erroneous theory which had been published

Mr. Althea R. Sherman,
to the effect that humming birds show a preference for red flowers.
In further proof of the fallacy of this statement the third flower,
shaped like the nasturtium, was painted green, and was placed in a
bed of green plants which at that time bore no blossoms. It was
pronounced by other people to be "exactly the color of the surround-
ing foliage." It was staked out and filled on August 5, 1909, when
no humming bird was in sight, but in about 10 minutes some of the
species had come, and 15 minutes later one was drinking from the
bottle in this green flower.
It was then suggested by my sister, Dr. E. Amelia Sherman,
that I try a bottle without an encircling flower. The problem of
supporting a bottle without an artificial flower w r as solved in this way :
The bottle was incased in a piece of unbleached muslin, enough of
the cloth extending beyond the bottom of the bottle to allow the tack-
ing of it to a stick. The support of the bottle in a position slightly
up from the horizontal was furnished by a piece of leather with a
hole in it through which the bottle was thrust, and the leather was
then nailed to the stick. In this arrangement the most vivid
imagination can find no suggestion of a flower. It was put out on
August 8, and in 43 minutes a humming bird was drinking from it.
The bottle was then moved from proximity to the artificial nasturtium
and tiger lily, and a humming bird found it in its new location in 32
minutes. This place about 8 feet from the artificial flowers has been
its position in the four succeeding summers. In July, 1911, two
more flowerless bottles were added to the group, making six .in all.
For convenience in referring to them the flowerless bottles will be
called by numbers 4. 5, and 6.
Bottle No. 4 had not been long in use before it was noted that
the humming birds showed preference for it, while the nasturtium
was sought least of all. This seemed due to the deep insetting of the
bottle in the flower, which caused the birds to brush against its lower
leaves, an unpleasant experience when sticky sirup adhered to it.
For this reason the filling of the nasturtium was sometimes omitted
for several days, whereupon the humming birds soon ceased to visit
it, although drinking regularly from the tiger lily a few inches away.
When the filling was resumed the birds returned to it as they had
been accustomed.

on feeding humming birds during seven summers. 331
In the fourth season of experiments the bottle held by the
green flower was put out when the others were, but was not filled
for six weeks. During that time humming birds were present and
drinking on 23 days. It is safe to say that they were seen drinking
fully 400 times from the other bottles, but never once were they seen
to approach the green flower. The first morning it was filled four of
them were about the yard and one drank from this flower two
minutes after the filling. The following year (1911) after dark on
July 14 the green-flower bottle was set in its bed of green and was
left empty for a few days. About noon on the 17th one of the ruby-
throats visited it, thrusting in her bill; the bottle was then fiilled for
the first time that year, and in a half minnte a bird was drinking
from it. To this is added a transcript from my journal bearing date
of July 17, 1912: "About 9 a.m. before I had put out any sirup a
humming bird was dashing from bottle to bottle and tried the green-
flower one. It was bent over in the green foliage, and certainly has
had no sirup in it for six weeks or longer. I filled it after I saw the
bird visit it, and she came again to drink."
The new bottles No. 5 and No. 6, covered like No. 4 with
white muslin and nailed to a weather-beaten fence picket, were put
out after dark on July 23, 1911, but neither was filled for one week.
The next morning about 8 o'clock a humming bird was searching one
of these bottles for suspected sweets ; four such visits were noted in
one day and on several other occasions. At the end of the week the
filling of No. 5 began, but no sirup was put in No. 6 for two years.
During these years a record was kept of each time a humming bird
was seen to visit and search this unfilled bottle, and the total num-
ber was 15, in addition to those visits already mentioned.
Thus far this writing has been confined to a description of the
things seen ; no theories have been advanced, no deductions have been
made, no hypotheses have been carrried to their logical conclusion.
The first deduction offered is that at the beginning of the experi-
ments, in 1907, the artificial nasturtium may have led the humming
bird to explore its depths, and, finding its contents to her taste, she
returned to it. Other birds may have found the sirup there in the
same way, yet it seems more likely that most of them were led to the
bottles by seeing another drinking. This probably was the case with

The Marquis of Tavistock,
the catbirds that have drunk from the bottles on several occasions,
although they have found it an inconvenient performance. The same
may be true of a pair of chickadees that drank as long as they re-
mained with us. They clung to the stiff leaves of the tiger lily and
found no difficulty in the way of drinking. Only one humming bird
learned to perch on this flower and drink from it while standing.
From the earlier experiments it was suspected that the humming
birds found the sirup through some sense, rather than stumbling&amp;apos; upon
it by chance or through imitation, but several things disprove such
a supposition. The principal one is that migrants passing through
the yard in the spring, but more especially in the fall, fail to find the
sirup. That these migrants can be recognized as such by their
behaviour will be shown further on.
The 25 or more visits paid to bottles No. 5 and No. 6 before
they were filled for the first time show that the birds recognized them
as receptacles for their food, though they were new bottles occupying
new locations. To make sure that the birds should not be attracted
to them by seeing me stake the pickets out, this work was done after
dark. The first summer that No. 6 was out, frequent pretenses of
filling it were made in sight of the birds, but no response followed.
The next summer no such pretenses were made, yet a humming bird
w T as seen to search this unfilled bottle on May 12 and 31, twice on
June 1, on July 21 and 26, on August 4, 7, 12, 23, and 26.

The red rosella shares with the peacock the ill fortune of being
a surprisingly beautiful bird, whose merits are apt to be ignored
simply because he is so common. If rosellas were as scarce in
England as Queen Alexandra parrakeets, and peacocks as seldom
seen as Mikado pheasants, what prices would be given for them
and what eulogies would be written by the few who were fortunate
enough to be their possessors !
Parrot-keeping has been a comparatively recent hobby of
mine, and six years ago I do not think I could have named a single

Australian parrakeet, except a cockatiel and a budgerigar. Conse-
quently the impression made by my first pair of rosellas is still fresh
in my memory. I expected to receive something about budgerigar
size, and my astonishment may be imagined when I found out my
mistake and saw the splendid plumage of my new purchases. They
were two fine birds, the cock being an especially perfect specimen,
showing all the striking yet harmonious contrasts in colour, which I
often think entitle the rosella to the first place in the lovely family
to which it belongs. They were acclimatized (coming from a gentle-
man at Teddington, who never in my experience sells anything but
first-rate stock at moderate prices -- 0 si sic omnes /) and although
it was winter I gave them their liberty together, after they had spent
a few days in an aviary. This I afterwards learned was a very risky
proceeding ; I should at least have kept the hen caged until her mate
had learned his way about, but by great good fortune I did not suffer
for my rashness. For some months the rosellas stayed to delight
me with their beauty ; then, when April arrived and I began to count
my unhatched chickens--two broods of six, that makes twelve, and
the old pair, fourteen to start the winter with--they, well, they just
vanished and no more was ever heard of them. At the time I sus-
pected a human thief and went about with feelings of murder in my
heart, but in the light of subsequent experience I think it is just as
likely that they flew clean away out of pure cussedness, as is the
habit of so many of their tribe.
" If you don't at first succeed, try, try again ! " is the
only motto if one is to establish parrakeets at liberty, and that
summer I bought eight more rosellas and turned them into a grass
enclosure with cut wings. Most of this lot were young imported
birds, but there was at least one old pair among them. They
throve well enough but strayed badly after they were able to fly,
and by the end of the winter only a solitary hen remained, who
had attached herself to a pair of Pennants. The cock of this pair
was exceedingly keen that his wife should choose a 40ft. perpen-
dicular rain-pipe as a nesting place, and the rosella never lost an
opportunity of gazing eagerly down the uninviting opening whenever
the hen Pennant allowed her a chance. Finally, the Pennants decided
it wasn't good enough and migrated into the unknown. The rosella

The Marquis of Tavistock,
stayed behind and I obtained her a mate of her own species, but a
few weeks later she was picked up dead and the cock vanished soon
after the tragedy.
In my next lot of rosellas I was more fortunate, as among
them were two old cocks who had been on the show bench and
were accustomed to captivity and the ways of mankind. They had,
moreover, acquired enough sense to stay where they found they were
well off. There was also a funny little tailless cock who was
" finger-tame " (a finger-tame broadtail may be defined as one which
will unhesitatingly come up to you and bite your finger severely),
but a barn owl ended his career after he had only been with me
about a month.
In the autumn I obtained a cock yellow-mantled parrakeet
together with his mate, a sickly rosella, who did not survive long.
P. splendidus is in reality only a local form of P. eximius with
yellower wings and shoulders ; but it is a very beautiful bird and its
colours are wonderful. By December I was left with six rosellas
(including the yellow-mantle) three being cocks and three hens. All
were fully adult and in excellent condition and they soon turned
their attention to selecting partners, their matrimonial affairs being
most amusing to watch. Some writers declare that the rosella
dances " before the object of his affections, but after much obser-
vation I can only say that I consider this statement to be quite
incorrect and a gross insult to a gentleman of refined tastes and
behaviour. The cock is fully conscious of his beauty it is true, and
knows well how to show off his fine plumage to its best advantage
by depressing his shoulders and spreading his tail; he may, too, give
an occasional hop forward to accentuate the general eff ect, but he has
not the slightest intention of making himself either cheap or ridiculous
and will seldom display to a lady whose affections he has reason to
believe are engaged elsewhere. During the early stages of his
courtship he appreciates a modest and retiring disposition on the
part of the fair one, and sometimes enforces it by a spiteful peck
should she appear too bold and take things too much for granted.
I had an amusing instance of the rosella's innate dislike of a forward
bride only a few weeks ago. At the end of the winter I was offered
a cock yellow-mantle, and although I have now little time to devote

to aviculture the temptation proved too great to resist. He was in
nice condition, and after spending some time in a big cage with a
bath and a plentiful supply of green food and other luxuries, he
began to display and bring up food from his crop, clearly showing
that he wanted a mate. A hen mealy rosella was obtained and placed
in a cage beside him, and for two or three weeks everything seemed
to be going well. The mealy was filled with intense admiration for
her companion and displayed to him with an energy and persistence
I have never seen equalled. The yellow-mantle, though less ex-
travagant in his demonstrations, showed great anxiety and distress
if the mealy was taken out of his sight, joined with her in defiant
tail-wagging&amp;apos; and calling if a whistle in the street suggested the
presence of a rival pair of parrakeets, and was obviously anxious
to fight a cock mealy rosella I showed him one day, out of curiosity
to see what he would do. When however the hen mealy was
allowed to enter the yellow mantle's cage he fled from her in horror
and all her blandishments were powerless to reassure him both on
that day and on the many subsequent occasions when I tried them
together. He continued to show uneasiness if she was altogether
removed, but it was evident that, while unable to reconcile himself
to the idea of a solitary existence, he could not make up his mind
to accept as his wife a person of such abandoned manners. Of
course his behaviour may be put down to cowardice and the natural
antipathy which exists between mealy and red rosellas (this how-
ever is often overcome in confinement) ; but such an explanation
does not account for his anxiety to attack the cock mealy; nor is it
quite compatible with his fearless display of anger towards his
former admirer when he had gladly accepted as his bride a little
hen Stanley, half bare from feather plucking and generally the most
unattractive object imaginable.
The three cock rosellas at liberty took a long&amp;apos; time over the
selection of their mates. After " walking out," so to speak, with a
hen for a few weeks, they would decide she wasn't suitable and
exchange her with a neighbour, a habit I have not noticed in any
other broadtail. One of the cocks was a very vain bird, who con-
sidered himself too good for the society of any of his near relatives
and so disgusted his would-be bride by his indifference that in the

end she left him and wandered away altogether. Her loss did not
distress him at all, for some time before he had joined some red-
collared lorikeets, of which at that time I possessed a small flock.
Now a lorikeet, though a model of social virtues where its own kind
are concerned, is most vicious and aggressive towards all other
parrots and the snubs which the rosella received were many and
severe. Nothing however could shake his faith in the idea that the
unappreciative lorikeets would come to admire him some day, and
when digestive troubles had reduced their number to one, he accom-
panied the suivivor all through the winter until it, too, joined the
majority. On the death of his companion the rosella vanished.
The rest were more fortunate. The extmius cock and his
mate first attempted to nest in a chimney with the result that she
made a sudden and unexpected descent into a room, arriving soot-
begrimed and with a cut forehead. After this unpleasant experience
she betook herself to a hollow elm where four young&amp;apos; were success-
fully reared. A second attempt at nesting unhappily ended in
disaster, for the hen disappeared a few weeks after she had begun
to sit and must have met with some untimely end.
The yellow-mantle and his wife also nested and reared a
solitary daughter.
Young rosellas are very like their parents, but they have
much more green on the wing and less blue, and a green band runs
from the nape of the neck right up on to the crown. By mid-winter
it is fairly easy to distinguish the sexes, and they breed, like most
other broadtails, when a year old, but full adult plumage is not
assumed for about eighteen months.
The correct method of sexing rosellas has proved a subject of
controversy. Personally I have no faith in the "green spot " test,
and flatter myself that I can always distinguish a hen by the small
size and ragged edging of the red bib. An observant aviculturist
tells us that adult hens differ from cocks in having white spots on
some of the flight feathers, but, if I am not mistaken, he also says
that this test cannot be applied to young birds.
My rosellas, old and young, flourished until November when
a tragedy occurred for which I was myself responsible. One morn-
ing I noticed the yellow-mantle on the feeding tray, looking, as I

thought, a trifle puffy. I deliberated for a time whether I should
catch him up or not and finally decided to do so as he was a valuable
bird I could ill afford to lose from an ordinary chill, so I pulled
the string which closed the trap-tray. When I went up to him he
seemed lively enough, but directly after I had transferred him to a
cage he staggered, coughed, gave a shiver and fell forward--dead. A
post-mortem showed that the falling sides of the tray had struck him
a severe blow, a danger I had always feared, but up to that time
had chanced successfully ; there was nothing else the matter with
him at all. My feelings can better be imagined than described.
After the death of the yellow-mantle, his widow joined the
family party of rosellas and proceeded to make herself agreeable to
the old cock. She was not popular with her prospective step-
children, and was especially disliked by the young cock and by the
old cock's favourite daughter, who for many weeks had been her
father's chosen companion. A good deal of squabbling ensued, but
the widow meant business and won the day, finally bearing off the
old gentleman in triumph, while his family were left to their own
devices. The favourite daughter, unable to endure the spectacle of
her rival's triumph and exasperated by the insults of her brother,
whom up to that time she had successfully bullied, took her de-
parture. The young cock ended by pairing with the yellow-mantle's
daughter and I bought, as a mate for the other young hen, a bird
which was exactly intermediate in colour between a yellow-mantle
and a typical rosella.
Towards the end of winter I had a spell of ill luck. The
yellow-mantle's daughter was taken by an owl; later, the young
hen rosella started to nest, became egg&amp;apos;-bound, recovered, and then
presumably had a second attack and died, anyhow she vanished
completely. Her mate was found dead in a pond some time later.
Then the old hen became egg-bound and I caught her and saved her
by the hot room treatment, but her recovery was a matter of some
weeks. When she was really well again I turned her out with a
fresh mate and both went clean away at once. It was very dis-
appointing, as when once a bird has grown really accustomed to a
place it will usually induce a strange mate to stay also.

peculiar, a brief description of them may perhaps be helpful. The
affected bird goes wrong rather suddenly and looks most miserable,
often appearing, from the way she holds herself, to have received a
blow across the middle of the back. She ruffles her feathers, droops
her wings very much and sits with her head under her wing, occa-
sionally shaking herself and stretching her neck in a peculiar way as
though something had stuck in her throat. Great heat (80-85*) and
the insertion of a little olive oil into the vent with a soft paint brush
will usually effect a cure, but alas ! owing to the almost universal
habit parrots have of nesting in the recesses of a dark barrel or hollow
tree, it often happens that a tragedy occurs before it can possibly
be averted.
Some species are far more subject to egg-binding than others ;
some individuals belonging even to the most susceptible species may
be immune, but it does not follow that their immunity will be
transmitted to their offspring. Over-fat birds are more liable to
become egg-bound than those in hard condition, but the most perfect
condition and the most careful treatment often fail to ward off the
danger. There is only one rule to be observed with birds in cap-
tivity. Never allow a valuable hen to breed except at a fairly high
temperature, especially if she be a Stanley, a hooded, or a grass
parrakeet. You may lose the chance of a nest or two through over-
caution, but it is better to have the hen without the eggs than the
eggs without the hen !
To return to the rosellas. About a fortnight before his
mother's illness I had obtained a mate for the young cock. He soon
discovered her and spent most of his time close to the aviary.
Evidently he had fallen much in love with her, but unfortunately
his father, now a grass widower, followed his example. When the
lady was let out there was a scene. The old bird did his best to
win her, but his son was too many for him ; he was not going to be
done out of the bride he had waited for so patiently and courted so
long, and although the smaller, duller, and hitherto the weaker bird,
he fairly ousted his parent and won the day. To console the old
fellow I got a second hen, and in due time he took her off to the elm
and a family were safely reared there the following summer. The
young cock and his mate established themselves in a barrel under

young were about half-grown an officious Brown's parrakeet and

A DERELICT PELICAN.
By Alice Hutchinson.
The pelican, whose portrait appears in this month's magazine,
was a waif and stray, found by some boatmen two or three years
ago, drifting about on Lago Maggiore, near Locarno. They captured
him and brought him safely to shore and presented him to the
townspeople who received him with open arms and gave him the
'' Freedom of the City."
The King of Italy on hearing about him was so interested
that he sent a beautiful mate to Locarno to cheer the poor lonely
alien, fearing he might mope and die in this strange land, away from
all his belongings. But unfortunately the lady died and her hard-
hearted widower lives a perfectly happy and contented life in his
own house and grounds, in company with a few swans and fancy
ducks, to whom (as long as they take no liberties) he is supremely
indifferent--a threat with that big ugly beak teaches them to keep
their distance, but on the whole he is not aggressive. Note the
look of contempt and superiority cast on the swan by that wicked
little eye.
His favourite place for standing to be admired is on the fancy
bridge over the little piece of ornamental water, where my lord
takes his bath. You will see him in the picture, having just come
out and preening himself in the sun : he had not realised that he
was being photographed, for he is so vain, that as soon as he sees
a camera he begins to strike attitudes. A third picture showed
him beginning to dance a tango, and looking very conscious, with
his wings crossed over each other, but the effect is rather spoilt by
his dancing at that critical moment for it has turned one of his
elegant little feet into a frying pan. I took these photographs in
June when his plumage was in great perfection.

HAS THE OBJECT OF THE AVICULTURAL

<bodyText confidence="0.988522166666667" page_id="32670462"  page_num="340" year="" vol="">
The magazine began life 21 years ago-- i.e. in 1894--as a
journal for aviculturists, naturally at all times a very limited com-
munity,who might indulge in the study of "British and foreign birds
in freedom and captivity," and to this study anyone possessing all the
volumes will see that the Society has kept. That it ever became a
purely scientific magazine is quite untrue, although some people
directly they saw a Latin name which they were unable to interpret,
were at once inclined to say, " Oh this is beyond us, this is scien-
tific." We certainly make use of titles of Latin and Greek derivation,
but the Avicultural Society has never published a magazine the
contents of which could not be understood and appreciated by any
of its members, even though they may not have enjoyed the privi-
leges of a public school and university education ; the magazine has
always and invariably kept to an instructive and plain treatise on
British and foreign birds in freedom and captivity.
I say this, because it has undoubtedly been bruited about
that the magazine is for scientific ornithologists rather than for every
day homely and simple aviculturists, and what Mr. Fillmer wrote
in " Bird Notes " [started I think some seven years after the
" Avicultural Magazine," i.e. in 1901] was really misleading (c/.
B.N., Nov. 1901) in so far as he said that our society at that time
claimed to be a scientific society. We leave the science of orni-
thology to more learned journals, notably the " Ibis," neither should
ice like to trespass on their ground. Mr. Fillmer wrote: "As a

" plain the attitude of the Club towards the Society. Some of our
" members have expressed a fear that the Club will injure the
" Society. I do not think it will, FOR THE REASON THAT ITS AIMS

" ever it may once have been, now claims to be a scientific society.

" keeping." [It was evidently at that time not the intention of the
Club to study birds in freedom !] " And the Club does all in its
" power to encourage shows. Having therefore different views and
" purposes, the Club has no desire or intention of competing with the
" Avicultural Society, or of draiving members from it. By all means
" let everyone belong to both the Club and the Avicultural Society,
" if they will. But while I feel obliged to insist upon the unscientific
" character of the Club, do not let us submit to the imputation of
" being wrascientific. Nothing unscientific, in the sense of being
" inaccurate, or contrary to science, will be knowingly admitted into
"the pages of "Foreign Bird Notes."

After all, that is all that our magazine has striven for, and
against.
Why, if by 1901 Mr. Fillmer asserted that the Society " now
claims to be a scientific society," did he write in the "Avicultural
Magazine" in 1900 as follows?--"lam very pleased to see the

" increase in the size of the 'Avicultural Magazine,' and hope it will
" be maintained. The magazine has been, and is, a great success,
" and I want it to become a still greater one." He then goes on to
suggest that the cult of canaries, foreign mammals, reptiles and
fishes should be included in its pages. Mr. Reginald Phillipps, in
answer to this suggestion, finished a letter thus--" If once the flood-
gates were opened ( i.e. mammals, reptiles, canaries, and so on),
" it would be difficult to withstand the inrush of the flood, and the
" consequent swamping of the British and foreign birds. When the
" 'Avicultural Magazine' was established in 1894, it helped to supply
" the want; and more and more it has done this, and more and more
" it will continue to do this--if we are true to ourselves:"

I maintain we have been, and are.
The year of 1900 to 1901 shows no difference in the style of
the magazine, but contains just as many practical and simply-
written articles on British and foreign birds as when Mr. FillmQr
wrote to say it was so successful. If there have been a very few
members who when at home are museum ornithologists by prefer-
ence, all the better for the society, since they tend to keep the
magazine from becoming unscientific according to Mr. Fillmer's

Miss E. Alderson,
interpretation, viz., inaccurate, but one of the most scientific mem-
bers, Dr. Butler, who has done and still does so much for us, and
to whom we should be very grateful, is at the same time as
keen and ardent an aviculturist as anyone, rejoicing in his living
birds, and quite content to call a spade a spade, or a bullfinch a
bullfinch, instead of Pyrrhula pyrrhula pyrrhulco. Is that the sort
of thing that frightened people, or caused them to spread it abroad
that our magazine was merely scientific ? I wonder ! and maintain
that the Avicultural Society has never swerved from its original
style and objects, that it should be just as helpful, as indeed it is, to
lovers of birds in freedom or captivity, from England or from foreign
climes, just as good a journal for advertising birds for sale or for
acquiring birds that are wanted.
Let our members store up these points, not throwing off the
old love in order to be on with a newer one, not crippling the journal
that was first in the field on its own particular lines; not detracting
from what was founded in the interest of aviculturists, who can ill-
afford to place their eggs in more than one nest, in spite of any
advice to the contrary. When the old bank keeps to its original
ways of doing business, one does not leave it for a newer one.

DIAMOND DOVES.
By Miss Alderson.
Amongst the smaller doves the diamond seems by far the
most popular. It is deservedly a favourite, for it is both beautiful
in colour and graceful in form. What is better still, it is a harmless,
quiet bird in a mixed aviary, and this cannot be said of many of
the dove family.
My first diamond dove--a hen--bought in 1899, cost me 10/6,
but in 1911 they could be had for 10/- a pair. The last few years
the price has again risen and a pair of birds fetch from 25/- to 30/-,
the former price being a low one.
For some reason hens always seem scarcer than cocks, and
are worth double the value of the latter, so that in buying birds
singly you would expect to pay 20/- for a good hen and 10/- to 12/-

for a cock. In buying it is as well not to buy birds of the current
year's breeding unless you get them from a good judge of the sexes,
or from someone willing to make good any error, as the colour of
a young bird is very like a ben, until it is fairly adult, and you may
buy a young, or poorly coloured cock, in mistake for a hen.
Even those who have kept them for long may make a mistake
when old and young birds are Hying mixed together. At the end of
last nesting season I was catching up about ten young birds to send
away in pairs. Earlier on I had tied a piece of dark wool round one
leg of each of the old birds to mark them, as I did not want to send
away my favourite stock birds. But unnoticed by me one very good
hen had lost the piece of wool off her leg, and this was only found
out when the catching up was completed. Some of the young birds
I had also marked (each aviary with a different colour) but not all,
and which was my old hen I could not tell. At last I thought I
had a brilliant idea, the hen had been sitting so much through the
season that her tail was certain to be worn, so I picked out a bird
with a very poor tail, and feeling sure I was right sent off the other
ten birds with a quiet mind. But some time afterwards my supposed
hen developed into a cock, much to my disappointment, as besides
the loss of an especially good bird I had lost all chance of breeding
diamonds in that house for the season--for hens cannot be had
just when you happen to want them.
Of course, the best safeguard is to move your young ones
early, but if other nesting is going on in the same aviary it is not
always convenient, and the diamonds themselves have very short
intervals between each nest. A good pair will have quite four or
five nests during one season, and rear one or two young ones nearly
every time. The greatest number of young birds I have bred from
one pair during the season has been seven.
I suppose most of our readers have known and kept the
diamond dove, but as there may be a few that have not done so it may
be as well to give a very brief description of it. The length is about
7i inches, 4 inches comprising the slender shaft-like tail. The head,
neck and upper breast are soft ash grey, the nape of the neck and
back are mouse-brown, the under parts pure white. The upper
parts of the wings are a darker grey than the head, and are dotted

Miss E. Alderson,
over with tiny white spots which show up very distinctly on a good
bird. The eye is bright ruby red, and the naked skin round is coral
pink, though the colour varies in different specimens. The beak is
olive brown, the legs and feet, flesh colour.
The above is the colouring of a cock bird, the hen may be
told by the white spots on the wings being fewer and larger--and
the general effect of her plumage is much more of a dun grey--not
nearly so blue a grey as the cock ; the eyes, too, are not such a
vivid shade of red.
I find it best to keep only one pair of nesting diamond doves
in each aviary. If you have more than one pair they do not seem
to rear so many young ones. I found they built their nests too near
together, and it ended in a general mix up, neither pair doing well.
I make little wicker baskets, about 4 inches across and rather
deeper than a saucer and tie them up among&amp;apos; the branches, putting
in a few short bits of heather and leaving more on the ground for
the birds to carry up. As a rule they lay two eggs, and bring up the
young ones, when they nest in one of the baskets, but sometimes
they are determined to make their own nest entirely themselves of
heather, fir needles, and hay, It is a far smaller structure than the
basket and generally I find only one young one is reared, sometimes
only one egg is laid, or again if there are two eggs only one is
hatched, somehow the birds seem to know that a nest of their own
making will only comfortably hold one healthy young bird. I have
almost given up expecting two where the nest is not in a basket.
Most of my nesting diamonds--I have six pairs--are steady
sitters, and do not go off when I go into the aviaries, but even then
it is as well not to go inside in a light dress (an old dark " aviary
coat " is a most useful possession) and to avoid seeming to look up
at the nest too much. Of course the fewer strangers that are brought
into the aviary during the nesting season the better, and yet how
many people think that any hour of the day, or time of the year,
they may " see the birds." I am turning hard hearted, but I will not
have children to see my pets in the nesting season, even though the
parents before hand tell me that it is to inculcate in their infant
minds a love of live things.
I had once a case where a very steady pair of bronzewings.

that I thought were perfectly safe, were startled while sitting, by a
little girl in a large white hat, and the birds never again sat well all
the time I had them. There is one pleasing feature in the diamonds
and that is their care for their young. I have found it almost an
unknown thing for a young bird to die of neglect. The parents feed
and brood them most carefully. When the young ones are too large
to be brooded---and they grow very fast--they very wisely still stay
in the nest. They stay so long that a day or so after leaving it they
can generally fly quite well. I always put down a bed of hay under
the nest when the young ones are a few days old. If they should
happen to be frightened and fall out it makes it so much easier for
them than if they fell on the hard cement floor. Once safely out of
the nest I rear up a slanting board as a little shelter, and put the
hay bed under it. The young ones can be guided under this pro-
tection at night, as they do not as a rule return to the nest, but
stay on the ground or on some low ledge. These sunny days the
shelter is much appreciated and the young ones make full use of it,
nestling in the hay. An old box, turned on its side, w T ould do nearly
as well as a board. I also should add that I give no bath for the
first few days for fear of accidents, and that I put a barrier of boards
across the aviary, so that the young ones are under the glass roofed
part and not out in the open flight, in case of a heavy shower. For
even if they were only wet through it is the worst thing possible for
a young bird to squat on damp earth, it is a sure cause of inflam-
mation, and young doves will spend all their time squatting, nothing
will stop them.
The young diamond doves are particularly pretty, and are
easy to observe as they have a way of sitting&amp;apos; almost rigidly when in
the nest, and when they first come out, drawing their feathers close
up to their little bodies, not moving till you almost touch them.
In this they are a great contrast to others of the dove family,
especially young green-winged doves. I have lost numbers of these
--fine young birds--through their extreme restlessness in the nest.
I have tried all sorts of nest baskets, shallow and deep, but only
succeeded in rearing three young birds, though many more were
hatched.
In colour, the little diamonds are at first a study in drab. I

Miss R. Aldekson,
have made these notes from two fine young birds who have been out
of the nest a few weeks, and the grey shade is still only beginning to
show a little. These young ones can now fly very strongly, and are
half as large as their parents. Crown of head drab, cheeks lighter:
throat greyish, with very faint deeper markings, almost like bars
going across : breast and flanks white ; back drab ; w T ings drab, with
bars across of lighter shade; tail drab, the outer feathers white :
beak drab, and feet drab-pink; the eyes are large, full, and dark, as
yet there is no trace of the bare coral skin or the red eyes, nor the
tiny white pink spots on the wings.
It is a pretty sight to see a cock making love to a hen. He
will run up to her very fast, and then standing still will raise and
spread his tail, the sharp-pointed feathers making a very pretty fan,
he will then start to bob up and down, cooing rapidly all the time.
The coo is quite a loud sound for so small a bird.
I have found the diamond doves very good-tempered birds,
though of course they want looking after in the nesting season.
They are generally anxious to nest very early in the year, and it is
then that they need watching, or they may fight amongst themselves.
These doves are very easy to please in the way of food. Canary
seed and white millet form their chief diet, but as they are rather
wasteful it is best to put the seed into a pot several inches deep and
large enough across to more than hold the bird comfortably inside,
If only a slight layer of seed is given there should be no waste.
I always think one great advantage in keeping doves is that
they eat their seed whole. In tiny birds and in parrots the food pot
gets full of husks, and blowing them out is not a pleasant occupation.
In this way doves need less attention than other birds, and the
aviary is far easier to keep tidy. In addition to the seed diet it is
w 7 ell to give the diamonds flowering grass or chickweed, though they
will do well on seed alone. Like all other doves diamonds seem
long lived and free from illness. I never remember to have had a
hen egg-bound, but simple precautions such as plenty of grit, green
food, and a little oil run on the surface of the drinking water, would,
I think, be all that would be needed.
I look on the diamond dove as a fairly hardy bird. Indeed
I think that many birds have more artificial heat than they really

need, for I have often noticed that the birds kept in my coldest
aviaries look really better both in plumage and condition than those
that are kept warmer, but of course the hardening process should be
gradual and should be begun in the early summer.
I once tried to hand-rear a young diamond dove, and for
some days it did well, growing very fast and taking food readily
from a quill tooth-pick (cut into shape). I fed it chiefly on soaked
white millet, just gently inserting the tip of the toothpick between
the beak and pushing the seed in with my finger. I got quite fond
of the little bird, for it was very tame, and loved to be near the fire,
perching most contentedly on my finger. Unfortunately it got a
chill, and this, and an accident combined, caused its death.
Diamond doves are not suitable for cage birds; their flight
is too rapid and strong for such close confinement, and I find them
very nervous if looked at from close quarters, they at once begin to
flutter and get frightened.
Gould mentions that the natural food of the diamond dove
in Australia is " the seeds of grasses and leguminous plants ''and
that the bird is more often seen on the ground than amongst trees.
He notes how friendly it is to man and that it is not infrequently
observed close to the huts of the stock-keepers, but Gould wrote
long ago, and probably with the advance of civilization the little
diamond has become shyer and rarer.
In conclusion, I may just note a strange friendship I once
had between two cock birds, a parson finch (who was the bully of the
aviary) and a diamond dove, whose wings were injured so that it
could not fly. These two would sit together, nestling side by side,
nearly all day long, the parson finch talking continually to the
dove in a language that was evidentlly understood and appreciated.
Since writing the above notes, I have been able to examine
the body of a newly-hatched diamond dove. I have often wished
to see one, but my wish was granted under rather tragic circum-
stances. Diamond doves lay the eggs almost invariably at a sitting ;
the eggs are so small that I had often wondered what the young bird
could be like when just out of the shell. Like most of the dove
family the eggs are pure white, and in shape they are rather rounded
at both ends.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
A pair of diamond and a pair of necklace doves were both
sitting well and quietly in the same aviary, being its sole occupants.
There had been a little dislike shown by the latter birds to the hen
diamond at the first, but it was so long ago and things had been
so peaceable that I had forgotten all about it.
Then, suddenly, one rainy morning the poor little hen diamond
was found murdered and wet through out in the flight, the cock in
the shelter bravely still sitting on the nest. He sat all day and then
left the eggs, and we moved both him and them. The necklace
doves seemed to have no quarrel with the cock bird.
One egg was bad, the other I nearly threw away, though it
was evidently good, but I ended in slipping the tiny thing under a
barbary, already sitting on four eggs of their own. Next morning,
greatly to my surprise, I found a very healthy little diamond dove
hatched. Of course I took the barbary eggs away and hoped they
might feed the little mite, deciding to hand-feed it in the afternoon
if they had not started, for it is quite easy to hand-rear a baby dove.
But the afternoon proved too late, for the nestling was dead. I
think it had had no food. It was dead in a sitting posture and
weighed only about one 8th part of an ounce. The body was covered
with huffish down, it was especially thick on the breast, the feet and
legs were leadish pink and each little claw was like a tip of crimson.
The wings were the same colour as the feet and had no down on
them ; the beak had the dark spot on the tip very distinctly marked.
As a rule my young doves are not pretty, but this little thing was so
dainty and perfectly formed that I could not help feeling sorry that
for once I had decided not to interfere and had left it till too late.

If members would keep notes or diaries of their observations
amongst birds in freedom or captivity, they might not infrequently
supply the magazine with interesting copy.
As a matter of fact I, and probably others find the same, do
not seem to have time for such note-making, and have to trust to
memory. By-the-bye, the Curator of birds at the London Zoologi-

cal Gardens has not favoured us of late ! " The Field," which has
so large a scope, and which can expatiate on a hundred subjects,
has opened its capacious maw to swallow up all his material! but if
we do not all try to help, our humble journal might go under,
especially in these war days.
And so it is that I take up my pen, in addition to my blue
pencil--though it should be noted, very much oftener do I wield the
former than the latter--to endeavour to set an example or to en-
courage. Not that I have much to say. I have reared some
partridges; only three; for a monstrous Rhode Island red hen
squashed five or six. The truth was, no bantam was broody at the
time that the eggs, already partly incubated, were taken.
Yet this little trinity of plump partridges is decidedly better
than none, for they are ridiculously tame, running about in the
aviary yard along with juvenile silkies and Japanese bantams, the
first to come to one's call, and really more trustful than the bantams.
They shake their short rufous tails, stand up and flap their
wings, which as yet they never make use of for flight, and almost
run over my feet.
Most jolly little birds, which will I hope remain where they
are. They needed fresh ants' eggs when they were first hatched, but
they soon learnt to devour flies, cocoons, and after that, insectivorous
food and soaked melox: hut this bill of fare was considerably added
to by minute insects found by themselves in the grass. And now,
with September come in, they are three well-grown partridges, safe
from gun-shot.
Who was the calendar saint who kept a tame partridge ? I
forget. St. Girolamo, was it? One has seen old engravings, the
saint at his desk perusing his parchment scroll, the partridge on the
floor. Partridges, pheasants and quail will become very tame. I
know a lady living in London who had, alas " had," a Douglas quail
which is closely related to the better-known Californian quail, but
the Douglas has an upright crest of rufous feathers, which have not
bare shafts and do not curl over forwards as in the Californian.
And this particular Douglas quail was so much a member of the
family that he would be brought in by the butler, just as a child is
sent for and is carried down by its nurse to the drawing room or

An occasional visit to the country where he could have

have prolonged his life Fresh insects and country lettuce instead

only to receive as answer, quietly but firmly, "No! never again."
" Why not a Pekingese? " I put in. But she shook her head and
firmly renewed " No, nothing." And so the house is empty. Empty,
that is, of pets ; but full of kindness. And now I must return to
my birds.

Amongst the many ducks I have two especial favourites, a
pair of the lovely little ringed teal; favourites, not only because of
their beauty, but also because of their tameness and intelligence.
We have our meals in fine weather in a loggia close to the
moat, and the ringed teal always know when we are feeding and
swim round to that particular spot. They can't see us owing to the
stone parapet, but the little duck quickly lets us know they are
there, uttering her curious mewing call.
The summer was passing along, and one day in July we said
" if only there could be some baby ringed teal," but there seemed
no signs of such an event. Then we went away for ten days, and
on our return were rather alarmed, for during the first three or four
days we never saw the little duck, only her mate. Then she
appeared one evening; then the next evening, and the next. " Oh !
eggs,'&amp;apos; we exclaimed, " it must mean eggs." And so I watched, but
never saw her actually leaving any terrestrial spot, only she always
appeared on the pond above the moat.
Now in the middle of that pond there is an islet consisting
of just as much earth as will hold the roots of a very old willow
whose branches are broken and bent and hollow, so that they lean
out over the water in all directions. Finally I took ship, in the
shape of a small and tipetty dinghy, from which I clambered on to
an overhanging bough and thus on to this absurd islet. One can

overlook it with three glances ; the first showing me the little ringed
teal quietly slipping into the water, the second a hollow in a
horizontal branch about a foot from the ground, the third a snug
nest of down upon dry chips of wood within the hollow, in which
reposed nine eggs! They much resembled bantam's eggs, but had
a slight pinkish tint from the yolks within the shells ; their size
much the same too. To leave them would have been useless, for
no ducklings survive brought out amongst a crowd of full grown
ducks who eat up every available particle of natural food, and
therefore I transferred them to a basket, carrying them off to a
broody silky. *
One day in August a white-necked crane was missing, one
out of three which hadn't been pinioned, and nowhere could that
rare and stately bird be seen. Post cards were fired around to
neighbours, the police were consulted and an advertisement put in
the local paper, but none of these things took effect, for on the
second day the crane was found a mile and a half away in a field of
barley, chased over two other fields and captured by a boy of 17 in
His Majesty's noble army, who was enjoying three days leave
at home. In Herefordshire, herons are often called cranes, and one
neighbour I wrote to answered by return saying that probably my
bird would be found on a marshy spot not far off, " as there
are usually some cranes there."
Fancy going out to bag a few Manchurians, and so on !

looking bird, CEgintha viridissima (Iora)--bright yellowish green,
with double white bars across the wings. There were two of these,
one of which is in the possession of the Editor; the other unfor-
tunately died at the London Zoological Gardens.
Another interesting bird (3) is the small black and white
bushchat, closely related to the British stone-chat. It is black,
with white tail-coverts and abdomen, and a white line along the
shoulders -- and is said to be a good songster.
The coral-billed bulbul was also brought (.Hypsipetes psaroides)
--dark grey, with a glossy crest ; bright coral-red bill and feet, the
tail somewhat forked.
The small babbler and the green Iora are imported to Europe
for the first time. H. D. A.
A COMBAT IN MUSIC.
Some while ago I heard a great scuffle and commotion going
on in our orchard, and, at the same time, the most beautiful thrush
melody, poured forth so loudly and vociferously that I felt sure
something was very much the matter in the bird world. Hastening
to the spot I discovered two young cock thrushes having a tre-
mendous battle and literally shrieking with song as it went on.
When I appeared, one flew into a quince tree and sang, the other
into a may tree and sang, each as loud as he could. I chased them
off in opposite directions, and as I left the scene of action I heard
them beginning again. Many a thrush battle I have watched and
wondered at the silly sight it presents, how they skirt round each
other with heads lowered and necks elongated, wings shaking and
tails spread out like fans. And then the attack and aerial battle,
a confused mass of beating wings and snapping beaks, and then
dropping to earth again, grovelling and repeating the same inane
performance, sometimes springing up into the air and whistling ;
but I have never heard thrushes pour forth the fierce, weird music
during their combats that I heard from those two in the orchard.

question must be a tame owl which, about two years ago, got out
of its cage by accident, and if so it has been marvellously constant
to its old mate, coming as soon as it is dusk on to a juniper tree
opposite the owlery, or perching on the cage itself. When I saw
the owl hooting I was in a room, the window of which looks west,
and on the bough of an ancient walnut-tree that hangs down in
front of the owlery I saw against the bright sky the form of a very
large owl. It bent its head forward, and hunching its back, gave
vent to several long hoots, looking as if it were shaking the sound
out of its throat, repeated with an effort three or four times ; the
caged owl answering. When I went out on to the lawn it slowly
flew up on to the roof of the owlery, where it was lost to sight
among the branches of a yew-tree. Katharine Currey.

DEGREASE OF HOUSE SPARROWS IN NORANCHES.

SIR,--A few weeks ago a friend wrote to me from Noranches, Normandy,
asking if I could suggest any reason for the decided decrease of house sparrows
in Noranches during this year. She also said that they had almost disappeared
from Paris, where they are usually very noticeable. I could offer no suggestions,
so thought I would write to ask if you, or any member of the Society, knowing
France, had noticed the same thing since the war began, and had any idea as to
the reason ; if so, I should be much interested to hear.
F. BARLOW-MASSICKS.
THE WINTER TREATMENT OF BIRDS.
SIR,--The Avicultural Society is to be congratulated on having so many
keen and observant aviculturists among its members. It is pleasing, too, to
note the temperate manner in which they approach so very controversial a
subject as the above. It is quite impossible for all of us to think alike, and
moreover entirely undesirable. It is only by opening the doors of discussion
that our hobby is ever likely to make progress. It is highly gratifying to be
able to say that aviculture has made vast strides during the last decade. Fancy
people breeding flocks of cordon bleus or firefinches a dozen or fifteen years ago,
and yet such a thing as that is to-day a matter of actual occurrence. But
" revenons d nos moutons." Mr. Rattigan has discovered one great truth,
pointed out by Mr. Shore Bailey and confirmed by myself, that is that birds
will use a shelter if they have no cover outside. He is also right in&amp;apos;his surmising
that it is the cold wet nights that play such havoc with birds that roost out.
The winter nights being so much longer than the summer nights of course
greatly aggravates the mischief, and hence one's losses are very much greater.
In all this he and I are in absolute agreement, and I thank him most cordially
for his support to what is, after all, a very common sense view of the matter.
But here we come to the parting of the ways, and I fear that Mr. Rattigan is
deducing arguments from too limited an experience as regards different classes of
birds, different types of aviaries and different kinds of locality. I think one
might almost take it as an axiom that the larger the aviaries and the more closely
they conform to nature the better the breeding results. Mr. Teschemaker, one
of our most brilliant breeders of difficult birds, could tell us of the infinite

trouble he takes to make an aviary natural. I doubt if he would ever raise a
softbill in an aviary unless it was a naturally planted one.
Birds like grassfinches or parrakeets will even breed iu a good-sized cage,
but not the rarer waxbills, softbills, weavers, or larger parrakeets. Apart from
considerations of breeding, a natural aviary is so extraordinarily fascinating and
the birds enjoy their captivity so much more. Then growing plants purify the
ground, and shutting the birds up for the winter gives the flight a good rest, a
very important consideration.
With regard to showing. I may say that I went into my aviaries less
than a week before I showed my birds and picked out a few convenient ones. I
showed twice with 15 and 13 cages and obtained 18 and 16 awards respectively.
So that the contention that birds do better in cages than in an aviary is certainly
no contention of mine. My contention was that they are less likely to die in
cages. I could myself name exceptions, of which most softbills are an example,
But ask any dealer of repute, as I have actually done, and he will tell you that he
would not dare trust his stock in an aviary. Dr. Hopkinson has just returned
with a large number of quail finches (0. atricollis ) and bar-breasted firefinches
( L. rufopicta). In grossly overcrowded cages, and in one case it was impossible
to clean it out, he did not lose a single bird. And yet of the former quail
finches he brought over and deposited in various aviaries, but a remnant remain.
He and others have proved time after time that birds like firefinches, cordon
bleus, and pintail parrot-finches will live more or less indefinitely in cages, but
die off as soon as ever they are put out. Zebra finches die off in aviaries too.
If it were not so they would soon be as common as larks and linnets. They are
extraordinarily prolific and are imported by the thousand. What happens to
them all ?
I only speak from experience, and, at the risk of being thought a bore, I
will repeat my experiments and observations are based on a collection of at least
400 -- 500 birds of all sorts and description, kept in aviaries with flights and
without flights, heated and unheated, well lighted and ill lighted. I possess
hardbills and softbills, hardy birds and delicate birds, and have in two years
bred 32 different species of foreign birds and four species for the first time in
captivity. This year I have already bred 78 young birds and 18 different species.
I do not say this in any boastful spirit but merely to show my credentials. If
Mr. Rattigan, or any other member, would care to come and see my aviaries, I
should be most happy to show them to him and put him up for the night. Then
he can judge for himself as to how the birds are looked after.
One last word. All my birds are fed indoors, except in mid-summer, when
a proportion of the food is put outside for various reasons, chiefly perhaps to
enable the young to find the food more easily.
In conclusion, I should like to tender Mr. Rattigan my sincerest sympathy
in his unfortunate loss. To lose practically the cream of one's collection at one
fell swoop would be enough to dishearten Hercules.

As Mr. F. E. Blaauw and I wrote about the Ruddy headed goose
in our magazine of June, 1913 (3rd series, Vol. IV. No. 8) I will not
do more than remind our members that this extremely handsome
goose is the smallest of its genus {Chloephaga = e ater of grass), and
has never been anything but rare in captivity. A native of the
southern parts of South America and the Falkland Islands, it is a
migrating species. It has been observed in flocks in Tierra del
Fuego, and is a summer visitor in the country behind Punta Arenas,
breeding on the rough land to the west of the town.
In captivity this goose is absolutely hardy and easy to keep,
so long as it has a run of fresh grass.
It is also a free breeder, one of my two pairs having had
three clutches of eggs one season, owing to my removing the eggs to
be incubated by a hen. The goslings are easily reared on poultry
meal and chopped clover, dandelion leaves, etc.
Mr. Blaauw notes that some of the adult males have a beau-
tiful pearl-grey colour about the underparts instead of the bright
fox-red. Although I have bred a fair number, I have never observed
this myself.
In winter time I give my geese some melox, which they
greatly appreciate.

Panurus biarmicus.
By Dr. L. Lovell-Keays.
My reedlings' aviary is fast becoming as famous as the
Traitors' Gate or the stair beneath which the murdered princes are
supposed to repose. There is really nothing very wonderful about
it. The measurements are roughly 22 feet hy 15 feet and the
height is 8 feet. In this latter respect uniform with practically
the entire series. Attached to the flight are three shelters ; two of
which are 4i feet by 8 feet and the third 6 feet by 8 feet. These
face due south. I am drawing a rough plan of the aviary, as pro-
bably the way it was planted and arranged contributed very largely
to my success, or shall I say, the little birds' success. It will be
noticed that the flight is very thickly planted with evergreens,
chiefly retinosporas, honeysuckles, and last, but not least, large
clumps of variegated ribbon grass and the ordinary reeds found in
overgrown ponds. The latter I got from a distance (7 miles) and
brought a couple of pailfuls of the original mud and water. When
planted they formed a conspicuous bank. I don't believe these
reeds had the least to do with the birds' success. As to feeding
the young on the flowering heads I believe that to be quite ridiculous.
They are not in bloom at the time. My water-course, too, dried up
about mid-June owing to the drought. But I was anxious to get a
natural nest, and to some extent I was rewarded, for the bearded tits
built a wonderful nest in the clump of ribbon grass, which I hope to
describe presently. For a small aviary I have never seen a more
natural one, nor more dense as regards cover; and the place is
teeming with insects the whole summer.
The shelters are built entirely of match-boarding, two layers
with felt between. Whitewashed inside and with a very ample
supply of windows. The successful nest was situated in the corner
of the shelter marked with a X The entrance to this shelter was
quite small, about 18 ins. square and quite high up. This prevented
the young birds getting out too soon, for which I was extremely
thankful. This shelter was fitted with what the Sussex folk call pea-
boughs, rush nests and one or two small square travelling cages. All
the nesting receptacles were placed high up against the roof and as

far as possible in corners facing the light. In this instance a small
branch of oak with leaves attached was nailed in front of the rush
nest and the leaves acted as a partial screen to the birds. My

perching branches are always nailed to the roof. Experience has
taught me that birds will roost as near the roof as possible. The
third shelter on the right of the plan was closed to the reedlings'
aviary all the summer. It should be mentioned that the shelters

sloped away from south to north, which of course allows very much
more light and air to get in. I don't think the plan calls for much
comment. The food is kept under a kind of small lean-to in front
of the middle shelter during the breeding season, but when young
birds are hatched out extra live food was placed on top of the post
and on a shelf in the left-hand shelter. The aviary is an ideal
summer aviary but a nasty damp place in the winter. The shelters
are then only used as bird-rooms for quite hardy birds. It will be
noticed that every aviary of this my " South Series " communicates
with the next door one. The advantages of this are of course
sufficiently obvious. The floor of the shelters is composed of
6 ins. of broken bricks, &amp;c., covered with 3 ins. of fine sea sand.
This last is called " gravel " in Sussex. So much for the aviary.
Next we will take the inmates as they are of no little importance.
Last year (1914) I kept a mixed series here, consisting of
reedlings (3 pairs), hooded siskins, cordon bleus, firefinches, and (I
think) orange-breasted waxbills. The reedlings very nearly suc-
ceeded then, but the nearest approach fell out of the nest about
two days before it could have flown out and so wrecked my hopes
and its parents' happiness. Several other broods were reared up to
ten days so I flatter myself that complete success was no mere fluke.
This year I had in this aviary five pairs of reedlings, some
dull yellow birds, which a patient left with me and which I am told
were canaries, a cross-bred goldfinch, and a pair of the most charm-
ing little long-tailed tits one could imagine. The stupid yellow birds
did their best to risk extermination, and I only discovered in time to
save the season why it was my reedlings were not nesting. Take
away a canary's song and you have all that is dull and stupid
epitomized in the self-same canary. Within a few days of banishing
this "left luggage " my favourite pair of reedlings started to celebrate
the year 1915 and the Park Lodge aviaries. By an odd coincidence
it was the same pair that obtained the first prize at the Horticultural
Hall last November, which reminds me that at a very second rate
show at Hastings this pair was awarded an H.C. in a miserably
weak class. So much for judge's judgment! As a matter of fact
the hen was the most beautiful hen reedling I ever saw. I say
"was," for, to my inexpressible grief, I have to sorrowfully record

her death. But her three children, who are all still living and
doing well, take after her and bear the same likeness to adult reed-
lings that a fox cub does to an old fox. It is a remarkable fact
that I have never found two hen reedlings sufficiently alike as to
confuse them. They differ quite as much as the eggs of the Solan
goose. With the cocks it is quite different and I am quite unable to
tell 11 t'other from which." I don't remember ever seeing this fact
noted before, but it is a fact for all that. My little hen was darker
than most with distinct longitudinal dark brown streaks down
the back of the head and back. Some hen reedlings get a kind of
foxey look, but this one always preserved her sweet expression. The
nest this pair built was composed entirely of fine grass, lined with a
few odd bits of fluff, hair, and a small feather or two. It was built
in a rush nest.
The natural nest resembles very closely that of the moorhen
(G. chloropus). The way the leaves of the rushes are woven with
the sides of the nest is simply wonderful. The nest in my aviary
was built about 9-12 inches from the ground. It was open, shallow
and cup shaped. The lining consisted of dead leaves from the reeds
and fine grasses. The eggs--which number 5-6 in a clutch--are
white and marked with fine wavy streaks and splashes of brown.
These streaks vary considerably in intensity and are fairly polar in
distribution. They are more distinct at the upper pole. The eggs
are fairly oval and smaller at one end than the other, and are laid
on successive days, or rather, I have noticed six eggs laid in six
days, which comes to much the same thing. Occasionally, in an
aviary at any rate, the hen starts incubating before the last egg is
laid. Reedlings are at all times very gregarious and, contrary to
what many aviculturists say, agree remarkably well. Occasionally
you find an amorous cock rather a nuisance, but there is no malice
in reedlings. I have kept five pairs in a double breeding cage with-
out disaster. I have never known a reedling interfere with another
bird, however young or however ill. They are expensive birds to
keep, however, for they all get into the food saucers and scratch,
-throwing the food in all directions. Quite babies learn this naughty
habit very early. With regard to this question of food, perhaps
before we consider the period of incubation and so forth we might

Dr. L. Lovell-Keays,
pause over this momentous question for a few moments. Reedlings
if kept properly have only one real enemy, as far as my experience
goes, and that is pneumonia. They are by no means as " hard as
nails " at any period of their captivity. Cold damp weather always
takes a toll of one's reedlings, so I keep mine shut up on bad days
especially in the winter. Their diet consists simply of the best
Insectile mixture properly prepared with an admixture of finely
divided Yorkshire cheese. This is prepared by squeezing it through
an ordinary kitchen wire sieve--No. 17 gauge. Cheese seems to
have fallen into desuetude of late. All my birds have it and I
believe it is the finest substitute for live food imaginable. The
Insectile food itself should be moistened with a very small quantity
of boiling water. It should neither be disgustingly pappy nor pro-
vokingly chaffy. If you will put yourself in the birds' place for one
moment you will appreciate the fact that you would not care for
stodgy suet pudding or (if still moister) macerated pap, neither
would you care for crumbled macaroon or bread a week old at the
other extreme. Then my reedlings have mealworms, according to
the state of their owner's exchequer, gentles, and real live ants' eggs.
The latter are of course of the very utmost value, but ants' eggs of
the best quality are very difficult to get. The ordinary garden ants'
eggs are too small so one must get wood ants.
We left our reedlings with six eggs, as a clutch, in a nest
built by both parents, but perhaps more by the cock than the hen.
Incubation is also shared by both birds to a degree that varies with
every pair of birds. In some the cock does nearly all the incubating
and the hen practically only night duty. In others the cock does
very little and only relieves when the hen goes a 'foraging. In the
latter case he seems very anxious she should get back to her
domestic duties as soon as possible and scolds his wife most
vehemently. The cock never, as far as my observations go, feeds
the hen on the nest. I don't think the cock ever incubates at night
time. The incubation period is between ten and eleven days, some-
times one and sometimes the other. The chicks when first hatched
are naked repulsive creatures and very soon acquire a look of morti-
fication -- a kind of shiny black writhing mass. No, baby reedlings
are not beautiful with their squat serpent-like heads, bulging eyes,

as yet unopened, and enormous protruding intestines. For the first
twenty-four hours the little birds required very little food and the
parents fed them on small insects that they caught in the aviary,
besides morsels from the insectile mixture.
My next observation of the young was on the fifth day, when
they appeared just like bits of very old shiny overstretched black
kid glove. The eyes open about 9th-10th day, for by the 11th day
they are wide open. Up to this time the parents fed the young
entirely on very small mealworms and some of the best fresh ants'
eggs it has ever been my lot to come across, and it is small wonder
the babies grew apace. At the 11th day, too, we find a dark stripe
down the centre of the back, the general body colour is reddish
brown. The quills of the primaries are quite distinct and almost
black. The crown of the head is dark brown and we get a dark
indication of the future tail.
By the 15th day our reedling is beginning to get less ugly
but is still very ungainly. The feet and legs are then yellow and
very large. The beak is flesh coloured and the gape, which is fairly
large, is yellow. The crown of the head is dark fawn colour with a
distinct dark stripe in the centre. The neck is dark fawn and the
back is similar to it, only we have here a dark brown, almost black,
stripe from the rest of the neck to the tail. The wings are dark
brown and the body a pleasing reddish brown; the tail appears
almost black and at fifteen days is of course very short, but grows
rapidly, and in about a fortnight after the young leave the nest it is
practically full grown.
All these events vary according to the weather and the
amount of time one can give in attending to the wants of the old
birds. I need hardly say that the more time you can give them the
better.
In this particular instance the important events may be
summarised as follows :--
Incubation lasted from June 17th to 27th.
Food consisted of small flies and other insects supplemented
by small mealworms until July 4th. After that gentles were offered
and given, also live ants' eggs. The latter were not obtainable
until about July 3rd.

On the breeding of bearded tits.
The young were first distinctly heard on July 3rd. They left
the nest on July 10th and left the shelter--a difficult matter in this
case--on July 19th. The most forward reedling was seen to help
itself to live ants' eggs on July 18th for the first time.
Now but little remains to be told. Unfortunately a tragedy
marred the triumph, for on July 16th I missed the little mother
bird. It was an appalling night and she must have been disturbed
and flown out, or perhaps frightened by an owl, for they are very
common about here. At any rate, I did not find her body till
almost past recognition. Thus she died faithful unto death, but the
father bird cheated death of the three babies, and they live to-day
(August 6th) and look exactly like their mother. They are far more
beautiful than adult reedlings, with dark brown heads and very dark
backs and wings. They no longer need their father's help ; in fact,
they find him far too slow. Of course they needed " meating off "
and I did this by giving them first fine live ants' eggs and gradually
replacing them with the usual insectile mixture. Now they get
practically nothing else.
In conclusion, perhaps just a few remarks why I believe I
succeeded would not be amiss. The personal factor is the one secret
of success. Every detail was thought out. Every mealworm in
the early stages was carefully chosen. A single day's absence from
home, and I doubt if there would be any young reedlings to-day.
One calls to mind those lines from JEsops Fables summarising the
moral of the farmer and the young larks. They are as follows :--
" Hoc erit tibi argumentum , semper in situ situm,
Ne quid expectes amicos, quod tute agere possies."
This is my secret.
&amp;apos;h &amp;apos;h
P.S.--Sept. 14th. The three baby reedlings are all alive and doing
well and are undergoing a very heavy moult, as the old
birds are doing. At present it is difficult to say what they
will turn out to be, cocks or hens, dark or light birds.

By Dr. A. G. Butlek.
Our Editor says that we make no claim to be a Scientific
Society, but that we strive not to be unscientific. I think there is a
misconception in the minds of many, and especially in those of
generally accepted scientific men, as to the real meaning of the term.
As all educated persons are well aware the word science
comes from the Latin scientia derived from the verb scio, and it
simply means knowledge: that being the case, every addition to
knowledge is a scientific attainment and any Society which is the
means of enlightenment by revealing new facts is in reality a
Scientific Society.
The man who names and describes new species has far less
claim to be called scientific than his brother who describes for the
first time the whole process of nidification of a rare bird ; indeed he
is little better than the reporter who accurately describes the dresses
at a wedding : he is a little better, because he has to look up and
read over all the descriptions in various languages of other species
in the same genus of which he does not possess named examples,
in order to be sure that the animal before him actually is new ; but,
when he knows the names of the different parts of the body, the
actual description can be made by anybody with an eye for form
and colour.
Now breeding birds is by no means the only method in which
our society has advanced science, although thereby interesting facts
have been revealed which previously were unknown even when sus-
pected. Much light has been thrown upon the fertility of hybrids
by Mr. Bonhote and others, the eclipse plumages of birds have been
studied and described, as well as seasonal changes in the colouring
of the soft parts, with many other facts of far greater scientific
value than quibbles over unsatisfactory problems touching the
orthodox naming of a bird, or as to its claim to be accounted a
species or subspecies. These points never will be satisfactory settled
in the minds of all zoologists alike so long as the world lasts.
Formerly students of Zoology were content with the binomial
system and Motcicilla flava for instance was considered sufficient for
all the slightly varied local races of the Blue-headed Wagtail; but

<bodyText confidence="0.997929432432433" page_id="32670498"  page_num="366" year="" vol="">
nowadays every local race must have a third name to indicate which
gradation it belongs to, and even if one race imperceptibly passes
into the next, that is not held to be of importance : to my old-
fashioned mind numerals added to the scientific name would answer
the purpose equally well without cumbering our catalogues and
adding to the labours of Museum students.
Can anything be more disheartening to a young and zealous
worker who visits a large collection for the first time than to discover
that all the names by which he has been taught to know our British
animals, whether vertebrates or invertebrates, have been altered so
as to have become utterly unrecognizable. If this is science we
were better without it.
What used to annoy me, when engaged upon systematic
work in zoology, was that some of the most enthusiastic worshippers
of subspecies made no distinction between the variations of a species
extending over a Continent and frequently linked by intergrades, and
nearly related species separated one from the other by vast tracts of
ocean often of enormous depths, and which consequently must have
been accurately reproducing themselves unchanged for many thou-
sands of years. In my opinion the first should have been called
either varieties or local races, but the latter true species ; and this
is how I always regarded them. I am certain that a form which
remains the same from one generation to another is entitled to be
called a distinct species, not a sub-species; and that unquestionably
will be the opinion of the coming generation of systematists, whose
tendency already is certainly to split up and name as species all
forms which appear to be constant, frequently I fear on insufficient
evidence.
How is knowledge increased by (let us quote a case) calling
a European bird Corvus corax corctx, an African one Gorvus corax
tingitanus , one from the Canaries C. c. canariensis, and so on ? This
has been done in the case of the common raven, but things more
absurd have been done in the case of butterflies which are widely
separated geographically and show no tendency to grade into one
another. To call such work scientific and the work of aviculturists
unscientific is puerile. Work which adds nothing to our knowledge
may seem clever to some, but it is science falsely so called.

Well I don't think most of our members will be much
interested in these matters, so I will bring my remarks to a close;
but in conclusion I must express the conviction that so long as we
are bringing to light Nature's secrets, we must really be a Scientific
Society, whatever our friends the systematic workers may think or
say to the contrary.

Urocisscc occipitalis.
By Maurice Amsler, M.B.
It is not often that the aviculturist has the luck to obtain a
pair of comparatively rare birds in full breeding condition when the
season is already in full swing. Such however was my good fortune
this year, when I heard of a pair of blue pies who had made an
attempt at breeding in a large cage. After some correspondence and
a day or two of waiting, their advent at Eton was heralded one
morning by loud and raucous cries.
I have never kept large predatory birds and I was inclined to
expect at least one good bite in the handling of the new arrivals,
but they had evidently been told by their former owner that they
were to be transferred to a happier home and that they must
therefore be on their best behaviour with their new owner. The
male bird allowed me to handle him and to place a copper ring on
one leg; he may have looked upon it as a form of marriage ceremony,
but in reality I put it on in order to be able to distinguish the two
birds more readily.
Books tell us that the female has a much more powerful bill,
I cannot see any such difference in size ; the colour however is
quite distinct, being coral red in the male and orange in the female.
The aviary prepared for the pies is only a modest affair,
some 18 feet long by 3 feet wide and 7 feet high ; it has a shelter at
one end with a partly glazed front. In this shelter I had prepared
a beautiful nesting site of wire netting and broom branches, nicely
hidden on every side except on that facing the glass front of the
shelter. The birds would of course build here and I should be able

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
to inspect the goings on whenever I so pleased. It was this very
inspection which upset the apple cart.
Before the birds had been with me many days I noticed the
cock bird feeding the hen with any tit bits he could find, and I made
notes of their favourite foods as a possible help in feeding young
should any be hatched.
On June 2nd I found some twigs of privet, which the birds
had pulled off a bush, laid at the bottom of my nest; in the mean-
time, Mr. B. T. Stewart, their late owner, had sent me a basket in
which the birds had laid when in his possession, this I had hung up
securely at the back of the shelter 5 feet from the ground.
No more building took place for a few days and I began to
think that the birds would go no further, what really happened was
that they had noticed my inquisitiveness and had transferred their
choice to the basket in the more secluded position. Here I dis-
covered that a foundation of thick sticks had been laid, mostly
lying in one direction. Above these they placed a quantity of twigs
of the yellow broom which I had provided ; these were laid very
cleverly in a circular arrangement, forming a solid cup which was
finally lined with a few pieces of hay and cocoanut fibre.
While the building was proceeding the hen spent her nights
in the nest, the cock roosting close by. On June 10th and 11th two
eggs were laid, the third and last being&amp;apos;laid on the night of the 14th.
The blue pie's egg is about the size and shape of a domestic pigeon's,
the ground colour is stone grey with a slight tinge of green ; the
whole profusely spotted with chocolate brown, especially at the
broad end where the spots become confluent. I really believe that
the clutch should have consisted of five eggs, as it frequently does in
the wild state, but that something went wrong with the hen's
internal economy. Incubation began on the 13th, but for the first
few days the female was terribly unsteady.
This aviary is situated behind a greenhouse, the glass of
which was " shaded," so that it was practically impossible for the
birds to see inside the greenhouse. Periodically I would tip-toe to
a certain peep-hole in the glass invariably to find the hen off,
or just in the act of leaving her nest. Things did not improve much
during the whole period of incubation, but on June 29th I suspected

the presence of young birds and found one chick obviously just
hatched, it was flesh pink in colour and had no down ; there was
also one egg&amp;apos; in the nest, the third egg having disappeared. On the
following day the second chick hatched out; this would make the
time of incubation about sixteen days.
It was many days before the male was allowed more than a
peep at the precious chicks, which were carefully brooded by the
mother. She willingly accepted the scores of mealworms brought
by the male and promptly transferred them to her nestlings. All
food was carefully torn up, swallowed and regurgitated.
On July 3rd both chicks showed feather tracts and were about
equal in size. On the 4th there was only one chick in nest, but he
was quite twice as large as on the previous day (my notes say " Has
he swallowed his brother?") I believe that the dietary I was
supplying was hot sufficient and that the parents broke up one
nestling to feed the other. Anyhow, from that day on, I economised
my precious mealworms and supplied sparrows, frogs, and large
earthworms, and all went well. All these various foods were dealt
with entirely by the male, who, as I have said, swallowed the requisite
amount, which after a time he transferred to the hen. I noticed
that this food was often retained for 10-15 minutes before being
given to the nestling, it was by that time partly digested and no
doubt in a very assimilable state; anyhow the youngster thrived
apace, and on July 10th he was like a huge grey slug, quills well
grown, eyes still closed. On the 12th the resemblance to a porcu-
pine was quite striking : general colour grey, quills black and two
to three inches long, eyes open, bill large, flat, and horn-coloured ;
in size he was rather larger than a missel thrush.
At or about this date the male bird was first allowed to feed
the chick and his duties now appear to have been doubled as he
would first satisfy the young bird, next the hen, after which it was
his duty to make provision for the next meal. This he did by
establishing a number of caches ; these would be under stones behind
one of the feeding dishes, or perhaps on some ledge in the frame
work of the aviary. When the selected spot was at all open, he
would hide the tit-bit by covering it either with moss or a few
leaves. Unlike many other examples of this habit, with which

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
most of us are familiar, the locality and existence of these larders
were not forgotten.
On July 14th the body feathers of the chick were well grown
and of a rusty grey colour : quills beginning to split; the white
patch on the head, which gives these birds the prefix "occipital,"
was well marked, but, in the case of the young bird, the white began
at the base of the bill not at the occiput; a few days later dark
feathers made their appearance on the forehead (see photo.) and the
patch more nearly resembled the colour arrangement in the adult
bird. The tail was a mere stump of quills with a tip of white
feathers; bill flesh pink.
July 20th found our friend sitting on the edge of the nest
surveying the world and looking very wise but a trifle tired ; in fact
at one time I was rather shocked to find him thus with his head
hanging straight down, I thought him dying, but he was in reality
tired out and asleep. Later on I tried to get a snapshot of him,
and in so doing disturbed him and caused him to fly the whole
length of his 18ft. world. I again approached him with my camera
and got a photograph which was considerably underexposed. During
this time it must not be imagined that the parents were sitting
quietly taking stock of the situation, far from it; I was several
times attacked, especially by the male, who would fly over and give
my hat (it was not my best hat) a good push with his feet as he
passed. Later, when I was leaning down trying to snap the young-
ster on the ground, one of the parents deliberately perched on my
back and pecked me; needless to say all this interference and the
terrible din raised by the parents did not conduce to good photo-
graphy.
It is said that two or three hundred of these birds will follow
and mob a leopard. I am sorry for the poor leopard, one pair of pies
can almost deafen you in about five minutes. You will say that all
this chatter is perhaps interesting, but that the "Avicultural Maga-
zine " takes no stock of the Felidae beyond the destruction of Fehs
domesticus, and I will therefore return to our young blue pie. At
the age of three weeks, when he left the nest, he was very suggestive
of a young magpie. Bill and legs flesh colour, head and bib grey
black, the latter considerably less in extent than in the parents ;

If by any chance he misses his footing in flying on to a perch
and finds himself hanging upside down he remains in that position
howling pitifully like a small child, the frenzied parents dancing
around and raising a din which can only be described as infernal.
I see I have lapsed into the historic present, whieh, I am told, is
bad form, but the early part of these notes dealt with past events
whereas I am now writing of the immediate present.
The young bird is now beginning to feed and I shall dis-
continue this article until such time as I can report complete
success or failure.
On July 25th I got a good photo, of the chick, now four
weeks old, and I hope our Editor will see his way to allowing the
portrait to be reproduced seeing that I have wasted several plates
for his sake.
I have already mentioned that the old birds were in the habit
of hiding spare food in the various parts of the aviary; their latest
larder now appears to be the old nest. This last trick of theirs
caused me some annoyance, for, I argued if they use the nest
as a receptacle for food they are not likely to lay again as I had
expected and my utmost triumph for 1915 can only be one blue pie.
Towards the end of July the hen was incessantly calling&amp;apos; for
food and the male would first satisfy her wants before feeding the
young bird; I therefore had my suspicions and, on August 1st, in-
spected the nest and there sure enough were two eggs.
On August 2nd I looked to see whether a third egg had been
laid and found the nest empty. I do not think the young bird would
have had the instinct or power to destroy these eggs, and can only
conclude that the male appropriated them to feed his wife and child.
I now begin to suspect that the same culprit was responsible for the
absence of eggs in the first clutch on June 12th and 13th, and also
for the disappearance of one egg during the incubation of that clutch.
As I was taking no risks I caught up and caged the youngster on
August 2nd. He immediately began to squawk for his parents, but
soon resigned himself to the fact that they were not there and that
he must forage for himself. Small garden worms provided a ready

solace for his loneliness and a few captive mealworms, imprisoned
under a watch-glass in the midst of his soft food, quickly taught
him to pick up food which was not in motion:
I think the question of feeding has now been solved for good,
and that I can claim to be the first person to have bred this species
in captivity. The young bird is now quite equal in size to his
parents, but gives one the idea of an immature bird owing to the
shortness of the tail, which is only about six inches long at present.
The colouring is still duller than that of the adult, the indigo blue
only being really well developed in the wings ; there is none in the
tail, which is still white with one or two black marks, suggestive of
the ocellation that is to come. The breast and abdomen are now
pure white. The white occipital patch still extends considerably
further forward than in the old birds, and the bill and legs show no
trace of orange, being still flesh-coloured.
The old birds betrayed no emotion at the loss of their off-
spring, nor has the hen laid the remainder of her clutch. The nest
is again used as a larder and much of the lining has been thrown out.
I see many flight feathers lying about in the aviary, these remind
one of Autumn and the end of the breeding season.
It is disappointing, but I have attained my goal; I must
admit, however, that I should much have liked another nest, to
enable me to hand-rear one or more blue pies. I do not think it
would be any more difficult than the rearing of young jackdaws or
magpies, and what a delightful sight one of these birds would make
foraging about the garden and perhaps pulling up my best rock
plants.
I hope later to send further notes on the colour changes of
the young bird. I dare not hold over this long-promised article any
longer lest it becomes too tedious and be rejected by our Editor.

to hand-rear.
The present owner of the first chick writes that the young
bird is now moulting, and is at the same time developing the adult

A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF BIRDS
FROM ECUADOR.
By H. D. Astley.
On the 7th of September Mr. Ezra and I wended our way
[it seemed almost as far as Tipperary !) to the Victoria docks in
order to meet Mr. Goodfellow who had just arrived with a collection
of birds, which are the property of Mr. E. J. Brook, of Hoddam
Castle.
Mr. Goodfellow, assisted by Mr. Percy Parsons, has been
collecting for the last two years in Western Ecuador, and has brought
back some marvellous birds amongst about 300 specimens. As Mr.
Ezra and I arrived on the wharf, the unloading of the cages had just
commenced, a seemingly endless procession, and as here and there we
lifted the canvas blinds, we could only reiterate " Oh ! Oh ! Oh! ! "
Tanagers galore of species never before seen in Europe.
Tanagers blue and tanagers green, tanagers orange and tanagers
with all the colours of precious stones ; bedecked in turquoise, topaz,
and tourmaline, in ruby, sapphire, and emerald, some in colours so
subtle that it is difficult to give them a name, colours which change
according to the light thrown on them or the posture of the bird.
And yet with all this, when I congratulated Mr. Goodfellow
and envied Mr. Brook, the former said : If I could have brought
back all I had at one time, it would have been a wonderful collec-
tion," for one large lot was lost through having to bring the birds
from high altitudes and long journeys into torrid heat, besides other
vicissitudes.
I think Mr. Goodfellow is a wonder ! and Mr. Parsons too,
(of whose experiences more anon).

Mr. H. D. Astley,
To mention only one contretemps, or rather catastrophe on
the homeward voyage, imagine the ship tossing and rolling in a big
storm. Mr. Goodfellow being woke up at 2 a.m., hurrying as far as
it was possible to hurry, in mere pyjamas from his berth to the
birds' cabin, where he found a marble slab had given way, precipita-
ting piles of cages in hopeless confusion on to the floor, and on to the
top of other cages, so that when he first looked upon the wreckage
he thought he had lost everything&amp;apos;. As it was, most were saved,
but some beautiful tanagers, whose cage was broken open by the fall,
escaped through the porthole and were seen no more, whilst a fine
bittern had one wing and leg so shattered that it could not live.
[Even one of the crew was dashed down, suffering a terrible com-
pound fracture of a thigh bone]. So that is partly why I think
Mr. Goodfellow is a wonder.
There is no space this month to tell how the birds finally
arrived at the Zoological Gardens in Begent's Park, of how we
helped to arrange and feed and clean ; in the midst of which I busily
took notes and names.
One's brain buzzed, and very grateful I was when Dr.
Hopkinson appeared and helped me: and he it is who has com-
pleted the list and most kindly written it out in due order. We
sat with books of reference about us in the library of the Zoological
Society, we peered at the birds again and again, to return once more
to the library, for this collection of Mr. Brook's has hardly anything
that one knows or has seen before; neither can I vouch for the list
being a complete one. I have, in one or two cases, added some
further notes on colouring, etc.
Dr. Hopkinson writes : "The following is a list (as far as I

" pile. We met at the collection's arrival and hoped to have given a
" short description of each species, but their number and bewildering
" variety has made that an impossible task, so divided the work.
" My share takes the form of notes on those I could remember, with
" the addition of such references to notes and plates as I can find.
" How few these are is some indication of the extreme rarity of the
" greater part of the collection. I trust that fuller accounts of these

A green bird, distinctly swallow-like in shape, which enjoys the distinc-
tion of forming a family of its own, the Procniatidae , placed between the
Sugar-birds and Tanagers.
Ibis, 1901, 458.
Four species of VIOLET TANAGER ( Euphonia ), [B.M. Cat., p. 58],

Ibis, 1901, 466.
A thrush-sized Tanager with black head, bearing a yellow occipital
patch, yellow breast, black wings and greenish back. The latter is now a
beautiful shining grey-blue, not greenish, this being one of the Tanagers, in
which Mr. Goodfellow pointed out the green changes to blue in captivity.
The result is that the bird looks almost more beautiful on account of this
cage-caused changed than it was in freedom. A very different result to that
which obtains with the many scarlet birds which lose their colour in captivity.
* * Compsocoma sumptitosa (151). THE BLUE-SHOULDERED MOUNTAIN-

A slightly smaller bird than the above with markings quite distinct
from his, but with roughly the same colour scheme, except that the yellow
is of a more sulphury shade.

greatly, so that one would think the cage contained two distinct species, or
at any rate the two sexes of a species in which the cock and hen were
markedly different.

With this lot, however, there is nothing even approaching the ' common.'
As living birds the great majority must be first arrivals, while many no

HYBRID BUNTINGS.
By Bernard C. Thomasset.
This summer two interesting hybrids have been reared in my
aviary. They were bred from a cock indigo and a hen nonpareil
bunting. For two years the parents had been in different divisions
of the aviary. This spring, as they seemed to be courting through
the wire netting, I put them together.
Very soon they paired. The nonpareil built a neat open
nest of twigs, coarse grass and wool. It was placed on a flat pine
branch in the shelter shed. Three eggs were laid and two young
ones were hatched. These were fed by the mother on ants' eggs,
mealworms and gentles, and on the eleventh day they left the nest.
The nonpareil was a model parent, most tame and confiding,
though before she went to nest she had always been a very shy bird.
As far as I could see, the young were never fed from the
crop. All food was carried in the beak.
Until twelve days after they left the nest, live insects only
seemed to be given. On the twelfth day I watched the nonpareil
shelling hemp and canary seed, giving it to the young ones from her
beak. It was not regurgitated. The indigo finch never fed the
young, but spent most of his time chasing and fighting with some
grassfinches which shared his quarters.
When fully fledged the hybrids resembled hen indigo buntings,
with markings, I think, less defined. I hope that one at least may

be a male. When in full plumage he should be a gaily coloured bird.
The long-tailed grassfinches mentioned reared a brood and
they have developed a taste for insect food. They now eat quite a
number of gentles, earwigs, and, in fact, anything in the way of
insects.
My old pair of gouldian finches have now (August) two broods
out of the nest; eleven in all. With me these so-called " unsatis-
factory " birds give no trouble at all. They are tame and hardy
and most prolific.
I feel sure that more gouldians are killed by hard water than
by any other cause. Here our only water supply is rain water and
it suits birds very well.

(Concluded from page 332).
One is led to wonder if the Homeric gods on high Olympus
were more deeply stirred by the appearance among them of the
youthful Ganymede bearing cups of nectar than are the humming
birds at sight of their cupbearer. When several of them are present
the wildest confusion reigns. Possibly not one of them is in sight
when the door is passed, yet instantly the air seems filled with them :
some swinging back and forth in the air, squeaking and fighting&amp;apos;, or
darting from bottle to bottle thrusting in their bills as they pass,
while an overbold one will buzz about my head, sometimes coming
under the porch in her zeal for the meeting ; but the timorous ones
fly from their perches into sight over the bottles, then back into a
bush. Some one of these types of behavior marks the bird boarder
from the migrant. The latter pays no attention to cupbearer or
bottle, but diligently searches each bunch of blossoms. For two or
three weeks after the drinking birds have left there is occasionally
a migrant among the natural flowers. The bottles are full of syrup,
but it passes them unheedfully.
Habits seem to change when steady drinking is practiced, but

Miss Althea R. Sherman,
in the case of the birds the habit does not appear to be a harmful
one. At once she ceases to search the flowers and, like the typical
summer boarder, she sits and waits for the food to be served. Bach
bird appears to have her favorite perch, a dead twig of syringa or
lilac bushes on the north, or on the south in one of the snowball
bushes; the telephone wires on either side of the street offer accept-
able waiting places at times. Not infrequently I have been intent
upon other duties about the yard and looking up have found a ruby-
throat perched directly overhead, her bright eyes seeming to say " I
want to be fed." So complete appears the cessation of the search
for other food that it led to the keeping of a full record for the past
three years of every time one of these birds has been seen catching
insects or searching the natural flowers for food. Most of these
instances noted were, if the whole truth could be learned, probably,
cases of strangers just arrived within our gates that had not yet
acquired the drinking habit.
In 1911 the drinking birds were about our place on 43 days.
During that time on only four occasions was a humming bird seen
catching insects or probing the flowers. A large number of plants
called " Star of Bethlehem" had been raised, these flowers in previous
summers having proved a great attraction to the rubythroat in the
yard of a friend living two miles distant; but our drinking birds
were never seen to visit these flowers. After their departure strange
humming birds searched them thoroughly, as well as the phlox,
tiger lilies, sweet peas, nasturtiums, and clover. These strangers
were present on 12 days. In 1912 the drinkers were with us on 77
days, and were seen but 10 times seeking other food than syrup. In
1913 for 49 days the drinking birds imbibed, and on nine occasions
a humming bird was seen gathering food elsewhere. In the 169
days that make the grand total for the three summers, the rubv-
throats were seen drinking syrup between one and two thousand
times ; they were seen collecting food away from the bottles 23 times ;
but one can not be positive that insect food was always taken then.
Never for an instant was one of these birds in captivity, and there
was the utmost freedom for it in choice of food.
This choice of a sugar diet, together with the large amount

humming bird would eat a teaspoonful of sugar in one day. Some
method of testing this estimate was sought, resulting in a plan for
putting the bottles beyond the reach of the ants that swarmed about
them. The stick that supported the artificial nasturtium and tiger
lily was nailed to a block of wood which was submerged in a flower
pot filled with water. For a short time this arrangement served
very well, until leaves and flower petals fell in, forming rafts upon
which the ants were able to cross. No myrmecolog&amp;apos;ist was at hand
to suggest a remedy, but at last the aversion of ants to kerosene was
recalled, and the water was covered with a film of kerosene, which
effectually debarred them. Nevertheless, one day the ants were
found taking the syrup as of old. An examination of existing con-
ditions showed that a grass stem had lodged against the supporting
stick, forming a bridge over which these wise little creatures were
busily passing to and fro. Except when the bottles were isolated in
this manner ants of various sizes and different colors fed constantly
on the syrup, often crowding a bottle to its very mouth, but this did
not prevent the birds from drinking. I am not prepared to say that
they never took an ant as food, but I have stood as closely as is
possible to a bottle while a humming bird was drinking from it, and
none was taken at such times. When a new bottle was placed, or
the old ones were set out in the spring and filled, it took from one to
two days for the ants to find the syrup. A small red species generally,
if not always, was the ant to make the discovery, the fruits of which
it enjoved for a very brief season, a large black ant soon taking
possession and holding the spoils for the rest of the summer.
The bottles, having been removed from the encroachments of
the ants, were ready for the first test. One bird being the sole
boarder at that time, a level teaspoonful of sugar dissolved in water
was consumed by her daily. In time, two, three, four, and five
humming birds having joined her, the quantity of sugar was increased
accordingly, a spoonful or two being added to offset any possible
waste. In this way more than a pound of sugar was eaten in 20
days, or, to be more exact, three cupfuls, weighing 9,252 grains,
which made an average of 462 grains per day. This for the six birds
frequently counted as present confirmed the first rough estimate of a
teaspoonful of sugar daily for each bird.

Miss Althea R. Sherman,
Another method of estimating the amount eaten was devised
On several days the sugar and the water were carefully measured
and weighed, then weighed and measured again, after which the
syrup resulting from their combination was also measured and
weighed, until I felt confident that in a dram of the thinnest syrup
served there were 40 grains of sugar, or two-thirds of a gram to
every drop. But the syrup usually used was considerably richer
than this, easily containing a grain of sugar in every drop; but it
seems best in giving the estimates to keep them to the weakest
grade of syrup ever served.
In making the test a dram of syrup was measured in a glass
graduate, and bottle No. 4 was filled. This was always done in the
morning, when the bottle had been emptied by ants. A waiting
humming bird came and took her breakfast, after which the residue
of syrup was poured back into the graduate, the bottle being,
thoroughly drained. Possibly a drop still adhered to the bottle,
but the number of minims now in the graduate substracted from 60
must have given very nearly the amount drank by the humming
bird. In two summers a number of these tests were made. A bird
took for her breakfast from 8 to 20 minims, the average being 15.
Using the low estimate of two-thirds of a grain of sugar to each
drop, the average breakfast held 10 grains of sugar. A better com-
prehension of the size of that meal may be gained by remembering
that two large navy beans or one medium-sized lima bean also
weigh 10 grains. Breakfast and supper were the rubythroats'
heaviest meals, but there were many luncheons between them. By
reckoning eight to nine such meals daily (and beyond doubt there
were that number), we reach again the first estimate of 70 to 90
grains of sugar as the daily ration. About this amount of sugar is
held by a common teaspoon when level full ; such a spoon will hold
fromllO to 120 minims of water, whereas one of those heirlooms, a
grandmother's teaspoon, is the measure of the standard teaspoonful
of 60 minims. Referring, then, to the standard measure, the bird
would be said to eat two teaspoonfuls of sugar daily. An ordinary
cube of loaf sugar contains the equivalent to this amount.
Reflecting upon the bulk consumed by so small a creature, one
naturally desires to know the weight of a humming bird. A little

boy brought to us the body of a male that had been shut into a
machine shed, where its death may have resulted from starvation.
Its weight was 33 grains. Naturalists in early days were vexed by
the same question, as is shown by a quotation given by Mr. Eidgway
in his book on humming birds. It is from Philosophical Transac-
tions, 1693, by Nehemiah Grew, who wrote: " I did weigh one (in
those parts) as soon as ever it was killed whose weight was the tenth
part of an ounce avoirdupois.'' From these weights one makes the
deduction that our humming birds are accustomed to eat of sugar
twice their own weight daily. If human adults ate of sugar propor-
tional amounts there would be required nearly 300 pounds of this
saccharine food daily for the average person.
No attempt has been made to tame the birds that came to
drink, yet one, perhaps two of them, became bold enough to drink
when a bottle was being filled ; while she thrust her bill into the
empty receptacle a spoonful of syrup was frequently held touching the
mouth of the bottle, but she did not learn to drink from the spoon.
While drinking the tongue was extended about a quarter of an inch
beyond the tip of the bill, and two or three drops were sipped before
the bill was withdrawn. Once 15 drops were taken with three
insertions of the bill, and at another time the bird drank without the
withdrawal of her bill for about the duration of a minute. At such
times the bottle was free from ants ; probably they were present
when the drinking was done with numerous sips. Often a bird pre-
ferred to take her breakfast in courses, perching on a near-by dead
twig for a minute or two between drinks.
During two of the seasons it was thought that some of the
birds roosted on our place, appearing as they did very early, and
making a long day for feasting and fighting. In other years the
birds were seen to fly eastward at night and their morning arrivals
were not so early. One June morning a bird was ready for her
breakfast at 4 o'clock, and took her last drink at night just before
the clock struck 8. On some August days there are records of their
presence at break of day ; in one case it was 38 minutes before sun-
rise. They usually lingered a short time after sundown, drinking
long and deeply before taking&amp;apos; their evening departure.
The conviction that the same birds were returning to us

summer after summer began to be felt at the beginning of the fourth
season. On May 26 of that year the first humming bird appeared
on the place. The next day the flowerless bottle No. 4 was put out,
and in a few hours a bird was drinking from it. For the next three
weeks she was seen drinking from this bottle on every day except
two, but not in the middle of the day ; then for two weeks she was
missed, returning again on the 1st of July.
The history of the fifth season was similar. Humming birds
having been seen on May 22, bottle No. 4 was staked out and filled
for a few days. No bird coming to drink, the bottle filling had been
discontinued, when on June 6 a humming bird on suspending wings
was seen searching this bottle. Not finding syrup in it she flew to the
spot always occupied by the flowerpot holding the artificial flowers
when they were in place. Over this vacant spot she hovered an
instant before flying away. On a few other June days a bird of this
species was present and on the 17th one was seen drinking, but her
steady summer boarding did not begin until July 9. In the sixth
spring the species arrived earlier than usual. No bottles were out
on May 7 when a humming bird was seen hovering over the cus-
tomary place for the artificial flowers. As quickly as possible these
flowers were put out, but before they could be filled the bird was
thrusting her bill into the tiger lily. She came to drink on most of
the days thereafter until June 9, also June 14, 15, and 24, and on
July 1 and 2 ; but it was not until July 16 that she came for constant
drinking.
These dry and dull details have been given in full because two
theories were based on them. That the birds of former years have
returned to be fed seems unquestionable from their searching at once
flowerless bottle No. 4 and from the other evidences offered. That
the birds came in May and at intervals in June and July before
becoming steady boarders about the middle of July, seems to indicate
that they nested two or three miles away, too far for daily trips after
incubation began. The supposition that these nestings were in the
woods is founded on the fact that in leaving the birds flew in that
direction, also because they were never found about the trees of the
four farmyards that intervene between our place and the woods.
That in two summers a mother rubythroat returned with her daugh-

ter was suggested by seeing on several occasions two birds drinking
together from one bottle, a phenomenon that needs explanation when
we consider the pugnacious disposition usually exhibited by one
drinker toward another.
In further confirmation of the foregoing is the history of the
feeding in 1913. Bottles No. 4 and No. 6 were set out on April 30.
For two months and a half no humming bird visited them. It
chanced on July 14 that the stick support of No. 4 was lying on the
ground, leaving only No. 6 in position, when my sister saw a hum-
ming bird thrusting her bill into it. She hastened to fill this bottle,
which was the first time it had ever been filled, and it lacked but
eight days of two full years since it was first set out. Six days later
I was in the orchard a hundred feet or more distant from the bottles,
when a hummingbird flew towards me and buzzed about my head as
do no other birds except those that are fed. With greatly accelerated
pulse I hurried to the house and filled the bottles. In exactly two
minutes the humming bird was drinking from one of them ; this
was the first drinking witnessed in that year. It was one of my
most thrilling&amp;apos; experiences in bird-study. Two marvellously long
journeys of from one to two thousand miles each had this small
sprite taken since last she had drunk from the bottles, yet she had
not forgotten them, nor the one that fed her. She was quite prone
to remind either of us when the bottles were empty by flying about
our heads, wherever she chanced to find us, whether in the yard or
in the street. Once having been long neglected she nearly flew into
my face as I opened the barn door to step out.
The last experiment made was that of flavoring one of the
bottles of syrup with vanilla, and later with extract of lemon, to see
if the birds showed preference for the plain sirup or for the flavoured.
Both kinds were served at the same time, and of both the birds
drank, showing no choice that could be detected.
It may already have been surmised from the gender of the
pronoun used that it is the female only of this species that has the
" sweet tooth." Never once in the seven summers has a male ruby-
throat been seen near a bottle. The drinking birds have been ex-
amined long and critically, with binocular and without, in order to
detect on some of the birds the identification marks of the young

males, but without success ; moreover, had young males been present
they, too, would have been apt to return in later years. This
absence of the males led to noting their scarcity in general, and to
recording in notebook when and where a male at any time was
seen. The entire number seen in the past five years has been six
on our place and six elsewhere. It is impossible to do more than
estimate the number of females that have been seen ; but when it
is remembered that on several days in two summers seven have been
in sight at one time, it does not appear to be an overestimate to
place their number at twelve or fifteen for each year or six times
more of them than of the males.
The simple experiments herein described are such that they
may be tried by anyone having a yard frequented by the rubythroat.
If any one doubts that the female of this species will choose a sac-
charine diet, when it is available, let him continue the tests until
convinced beyond cavil or a doubt. It is especially desirable that
the experiments be made in proximity to the nesting birds in order
to see if the mother will feed syrup to her nestlings. Sometimes our
catbirds and brown thrashers have come into the porch to the cat's
plate and taken his bread and milk for their nestlings. Upon this
hint for needed aid I have put bread soaked in milk on the fence
railing for them, and they have taken it also. It is reasonable to
believe that in like manner sweet benefactions proffered to a hard-
working humming bird mother might be acceptable to her and shared
by her with her nestlings.

HAND-REARING LONG-TAILED TITS.

By Hugh Wormald.
During the last week in March I noticed what appeared to be
a completed long-tailed tit's nest, situated in the usual site, i.e. a tall
hawthorn hedge overgrown with brambles (ninety per cent, of the
long-tailed tits in this neighbourhood build in high hedges overgrown
with brambles). I left it for five weeks, when I thought there should
be fair sized young in it, but on feeling in I found there were still
only eggs ; probably the nest was not so near completion as appeared
to be the case from the outside when I first found it. However, the
next time I examined it, a fortnight later, I found it full of nearly
fledged young, two of which with some difficulty I extracted, as I
was under the impression that they would make nice cage-birds. I
took them home and put them into the drying-off box of an incubator
which I filled with duck's down, into which they burrowed out of
sight. Eor two days they sulked and refused to open their beaks,
so I had to stuff them. I fed them with mealworms, small green
caterpillars, spiders, etc., but as soon as they opened their beak I
added " Ceckto." They could fly well in four days, and directly I
went into the room they would fly out of the top of the incubator

Mr. Hugh Wormald,
clamouring&amp;apos; for food, and settle on anything that came handy, my
moustache, pipe, nose, coat, etc. They did not begin to pick up for
themselves until I had had them for about ten days, when they were
no more trouble. They nearly died on the fourth day, I presume
the change of diet disagreed. At this time their tails were about
two inches long and growing fast, but the two days on which they
were sick affected the growth, causing the quill to be very thin, at
least the quarter inch or so of quill which developed during two days,
so that when the tails were full-grown they both had a kink about
2i inches from the tip, which spoilt their appearance.
When I had had them for about six weeks one of them got
out of his cage and was hopping about on the cage when my wife
came in ; she gave it some mealworms and tried to pick it up with-
out first closing the window. The bird flew out of the window and
then tried to come in at another window which was shut; he flew
rather hard against the glass which frightened him and he went off
into my garden, and though he was about for a day or two I could
never catch him and he disappeared, probably joining up into
another family party, of which there were several about just then.
The remaining one is now very well and tame, and at the time of
writing (July 29th), is fast getting his second plumage, his crooked
tail has dropped out except two feathers and been replaced by a nice
straight one, and the pink on the back is just beginning to show
(the young in first plumage are plain black and white with red eye-
lids). One always sees the eye painted dark brown in illustrations,
but in both my birds the iris was very pale pinkish brown, but the
pupil is large, which gives the appearance of a dark eye, unless one
looks very close.
My bird now, curiously enough, refuses spiders or flies, but
is very fond of mealworms, and begins calling and hanging on to the
front of his cage directly he hears me coming, as I usually give him
a mealworm when I come into the room ; he also eats green fly,
wasp grubs and moths if I take the wings off first. He always
beats mealworms, etc. against his perches before swallowing, and
has no idea of holding food in his feet and pulling bits off as blue
tits do.
Before I lost one of my birds they always huddled up against

each other at night, singing a low song (the only time of day they
attempted a "song," though calling all day long), so when the one
escaped I feared the other would mope, besides being chilly at night,
so I put a fine cock white spotted blue-throat into the cage thinking
that he would do for the tit to huddle up to at night; however, with
a cry (I persume) of " You German ! " he flung himself upon the
blue-throat's back and proceeded to hammer his head, so I had to
remove the blue-throat. The tit is very fond of my phalarope,
whose cage he has always shared, and every evening he gets down to
the ground and squats up against the phalarope, who at first resented
this and swore at the tit, though he never offered to peck it; now,
however, he has got used to it, and any evening one can see them
sitting side by side on a piece of fresh turf in the corner of the cage,
though the tit goes up to a perch a little later in the evening to roost,
the phalarope spends his days out-of-doors in a large enclosure, and
only comes in at night for fear of rats, when the tit greets him with
cheerful twitters.
Both this tit and the one that escaped were fond of bathing,
and took their first bath as soon as they could fly, and frequently
washed quite late in the evening.
I found a very late nest with young in it in the first week of
July and took four, thinking I should then have a good chance of
getting two pairs. All went well for four days when I foolishly gave
the four little tits a feed of rather unpleasant looking yellow flies, of
which I found a great quantity in a hay field; from their numbers I
might have guessed that they were bad for birds, but being short of
live food I used these flies, with the result that I found all the tits
dead the following morning, so that I have only my one bird left.
I am certain it was the flies that killed them as they were all very
well last thing at night when I fed them with the flies. If any of our
members has a long-tailed tit to dispose of I should be very grateful
if he or she would let me know, as these are very gregarious birds
and I am sure two would do better than one, especially in the
winter.
I have seen more long-tailed tits' nests this season than I ever
remember before, but I didn't disturb any of the other nests, because
up to the middle of June I had my two birds, and by then the other

nests were empty, though I saw a party of young which could only
have left the nest two days at most on July 25th ; these are the
latest hatched I have ever noticed.
Wild-caught long-tailed tits as a rule do not do well, but I
can thoroughly recommend hand-reared ones as cage birds ; they are
lively and cheerful, and, though their call-note is very penetrating,
it does not become a nuisance. My bird is very tame and always
ready to take food from my hand, but at present I have not the least
idea of its sex.

A French member received nearly thirty humming birds from
Venezuela in the latter part of August, including several species,
many individuals in "show" condition.
One of the most lovely, of which there are about half a dozen,
is the little " Ruby-topaz " -- Ghrysolampis elatus, or moschitus --the
male having the whole crown and crest brilliant ruby red, the chin
and throat resplendent topaz-yellow; upper surface dark velvety
brown ; tail, rich dark chestnut-red.
Agyrtria milleri -- Miller's ' Emerald "--is minute in size,
with a turquoise blue head and neck. There are also some of the
Lampornis "Mango" humming birds, as well as Amazilia sophice ;
Leucippus fallax (Buff-breasted Leucippus) and others.
After the war, if everyone isn't ruined, one may in the future
expect to see various species of humming birds as an ordinary
exhibit at shows. Who knows ? They may even be bred in con-
servatories ! Provided some species have sufficient heat, they are
as easy to keep as sunbirds, and many inhabit high altitudes
amongst the mountains of Ecuador, etc., and could withstand a
good deal of cold. H. D. A.
