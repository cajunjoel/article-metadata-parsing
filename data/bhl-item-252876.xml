The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send
a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Council may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. The question of awarding a Medal for the breeding of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred shall be at the discretion
of the Council. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures o.\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

(.Bolborhynchus lineola lineola)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The Lineolated or Lineated Parrakeet--possibly Barred Parrakeet
is preferable--was first described and named Psittacula lineola by
Cassin in 1853.
It appears to be by no means a common species, though of wide
range : Peters gives its distribution as " Subtropical zone in the
mountains of Central America from southern Mexico to western
Panama ", but being such a inconspicuous little bird it might easily
be overlooked.
Very little seems to have been written about this parrakeet and
what little has tells us almost nothing respecting its habits in the
wild state.
O. Salvin (1871) writes : " Mr. Godman and I discovered a small
flock in the Volcan de Fuego [Guatemala] at an elevation of about
8,000 feet above the sea-level. We saw them in a tree overhanging the
track to Acatenango, above the Indian huts of Calderas, and succeeded
in securing three of four specimens before the rest took fright and
flew away."
Emmet Reid Blake (1953) in his recently published work, merely
says : c&amp;lt; A rare bird in Mexico, this species occurs only in dense forests
at high altitudes."
This parrakeet has been imported spasmodically in small numbers.
The Zoological Society of London received its first example in 1886 ;
followed by two in 1889, and a fourth in 1895. Since then there have,
of course, been a few others, and a couple or so were added to the
collection during 1951-52.
Mr. D. Seth-Smith had a pair at one time, and writes : " It is
somewhat delicate, and should never be subjected to a lower tempera-
ture than 6o* Fahr." The Duke of Bedford says the same, but I believe

he is merely repeating Mr. Seth-Smith's observation and that it was
not based on his own experience. The present writer wintered
(1926-27) a pair in an unheated, well-sheltered aviary in the New
Forest ; and last year two pairs were not taken in until mid-November,
by which time there had been two or three light frosts. All last winter
Mr. Vane kept a pair in an unheated bird-room and on several
occasions the drinking water was frozen--they suffered no ill-effects.
Mr. Norris, on the other hand, has two pairs that show signs of
extreme discomfort when subjected to even a slight reduction of
normal temperature. These experiences are somewhat inconsistent
and it is perhaps best to play for safety and to take them in at the first
sign of frost.
The plumage is not identical in the sexes, as is generally stated.
The female is slightly smaller than the male and appears to be stouter ;
in build. The rump is less strongly spotted with black ; all the black i
edges to the feathers are narrower, especially of the lesser wing- 1
coverts ; the tail is wholly green, the feathers not being broadly tipped :
with black as in the male ; the beak hardly differs in form.
The Lineolated is slightly crepuscular in habits. In daytime it is ]
usually quiescent, and " freezes " for long periods. It frequently ;
perches lengthways on branches, and one is irresistibly reminded of
a miniature Nightjar. It may be said to creep rather than walk : I do
not remember ever seeing this bird actually walking on the ground.
It is not generally realized how many psittacines prefer to sleep ;
hanging head downwards ; the Lineolated decidedly has this ;
preference.
During late 1951 and early 1952, possibly thirty pairs were im-
ported. I rather fear that only about five or six survive to-day. Three ;
pairs were secured for the " Darenth-Hulme " collection ; one pair died
within a few days, but the four survivors did well and were put in an
aviary from late spring until late autumn. Both pairs took possession 1
of lovebird nest-boxes, but I think merely for use as dormitories, at ;
any rate they made no attempt to breed.
On being returned to their aviary in 1953, both pairs immediately
re-occupied nest-boxes. On several evenings both pairs were seen to
indulge in what was apparently a form of courtship. A pair would |
stand facing one another, stretch vertically to the fullest possible
extent, and with beaks interlocked remain in this position for a few
moments. On no occasion was coition observed. This display gave
cause to hope that one pair at least would nest in earnest. Owing to
the secretive nature of these birds it was decided that should they
nest it would be best to leave them entirely to their own devices, and
not to interfere with their nesting in any way whatsoever. Conse-
quently, it was not possible to determine the incubation period or to
note the colour of the nest down.

A. A. PRESTWICH-BREEDING OF THE LINEOLATED PARRAKEET 3
One pair had four eggs but only hatched one ; the other three
contained well-developed embryos. The parents, having only one
young one to look after, reared it remarkably well. The young one,
a male, is fully as large as its parents. The colour is rather paler than
in an adult, the markings are less distinct, and there is a slight bluish
tinge on the head.
The other pair had five eggs which they eventually deserted, when
it was found that three were fertile and two clear. The nest-boxes
had about an inch of peat moss placed in the bottom, otherwise the
nests consisted of nothing apart from a few feathers.
These charming little parrakeets do very well on a mixture of canary,
white millet, oats, and a little hemp. Soaked millet sprays are greatly
relished, and soft, sweet apple is an essential part of their diet.
It is believed that this is a first complete success. Miss M. E. Baker,
of Loughborough, had a young one leave the nest in 1913, but
it was accidentally drowned. It is a little doubtful that it was fully
independent of its parents and the event is usually considered an
incomplete success.
Any member or reader knowing of any other breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
One season has now elapsed since I gave an account of my Los
Angeles aviaries. Some birds have been reared and new ones have been
added. It was too early to expect anything from the ducks or the
Palawan Peacock Pheasants, but a few Harlequins and Painted
Quails have been reared by the parents. A pair of Diamond Doves
produced five pairs of young, while only one young of the silver 1
variety was raised ; there are also three young Mountain Witches,
one Bartlett's Bleeding-heart, eight Brush Bronze-wings, all from
one pair, and three Pigmy Doves. Interesting species have recently
been added : Blue-headed and Ruddy Mountain Pigeons, from
Cuba ; Moustache and Martinique Ruddy, the former never imported
before, I think, and very attractive, as well as scarce in the West
Indies, and some lovely Jobi Ground Pigeons from New Guinea,
which used to breed so well at Cleres.
Among the passerine birds, four Painted, three Bichenow's, and
eight Long-tailed Grassfinches, three Diamond Sparrows, and two
Cuban Finches were reared; one pair each of grey, silver, and white
Zebra Finches raised over forty young.
I keep adding a number of species to my small collection, and
naturally I have had to build six more aviaries near the top of the
garden : a block of three, each 11x5 feet ; another one of three,
9X3 feet. These useful little pens have a good shelter open to the
south, and prove excellent. One contains various weavers, Parson, and
Zebra Finches, a pair of Ruddy Mountain Pigeons, one of Peruvian
Ground Doves, and Australian Swamp Quails. The next two are
inhabited by various Australian finches, a pair of Yellow-winged
Sugar Birds bred in a canary cage at the San Diego Zoo ; a pair of
silver Diamond Doves, Blue-headed Pigeons, and Painted Quails. The
three smaller compartments are dedicated to Gouldian Finches and
Plumed Ground Doves ; Budgerigars of uncommon varieties, most
of them from Cleres, Mearn's, and Harlequin Quails, and Bleeding-
heart Pigeons.
Some nine species have been added to the large flight over the
stream ; a trio of Imperial Pheasants, reared in 1953 by Mr. Macken-
sen, who keeps a breeding pair for me ; a pair of the rare Hawaiian
Ducks, kindly sent by Mr. Paul Breese, Director of Honolulu Zoo,

four South African Jacanas, a pair of Hartlaub's Touracous, a Long-
tailed Glossy Starling; Australian Zosterops, Japanese Varied Tits,
Australian Lapwings, Blue Scaly Quails, and a few other birds have
been placed into other aviaries.

By Gust. A. Gjessing (Drammen, Norway)
Everyone I talk to is surprised when they hear that I keep a fairly
large collection of birds, mainly Australian Parrakeets, in outside flights
in Norway, which, most people appear to think is the border to the
North Pole ! But, as many English aviculturists who have read Cage Birds
through the years know, I have now worked at the hobby in Norway
since 1934, and have had fairly good results. What losses I have had,
have never been because of the weather, but mostly have been caused
by my own inexperience and lack of knowledge as to what to do in
time of trouble. I have remedied this by bothering eminent avi-
culturists the world over with a lot of questions. I know to-day a lot
more than I knew, and have this year built new quarters for my
birds, and this is what I intend to tell my colleagues in the Avicultural
Society about.
The war put a stop to my bird-keeping for a while. I experienced
a lot of changes and ended up by buying the new property " Wood-
berry Hill 55 here in Drammen. As soon as I had moved I set about
planning a new aviary, and last October began to write to all the
aviculturists I knew in England, Australia, Germany, and U.S.A.,
in order to obtain suggestions and experiences from them, so that I
could get my new aviary as near the ideal as possible. I built a
structure 10 metres long and 3 metres wide from two layers of wood
panelling boards, and insulated with glass-wool, which was encased
in tarred paper. I used glass-wool because it is 100 per cent vermin
proof. Plenty of windows in the front of the house, and flights facing
south, the back wall facing north, and the whole very nicely located
inside small woods, which are a good protection against the weather.
The entrance holes to the flights I placed down by the ground--*
against the advice of many aviculturists, but knowing that warm
air goes up and cold air stays down, I figured that the further down
the holes were the more warm air I would conserve in winter. I will
admit that it took a long time to train the birds to use these entrances
regularly, but I succeeded, and now they all do so without any trouble.
The flights were built in compartments, each compartment to accom-
modate one breeding pair of parrakeets.
In the middle of the " battery " of compartments, I built a large
one intended to hold possible young birds. The house, as I have stated,
was 10 metres long. At the end of this house I built a large open
flight without a connecting inside flight, 7 yards by 1.1 yards, where
this summer I have had a pair of Roseate Cockatoos. The inside
flights are 1.1 yard by 1.7 yard, and all compartments, inside and
outside, are about 3 yards high. For netting I have used the strongest

one can buy in half-inch mesh. All compartment walls are double
to avoid biting of feet and beaks through the netting. Outside netting
walls are double to keep out cats and other animals, only the front
is single to allow a good view.
The aviary is so placed that I can see it from all the important
windows in the main house. I use fluorescent lighting, two lamps each
of 40 watts. This can be turned on and off from the main house.
Around the bird aviary I have planted many hundreds of beautiful
and strange mosses and other plants, collected in the woods of Norway
and moved into my place. I wanted the whole thing to be original
and beautiful, and have so far been more than lucky. From the road
there is a special entrance into the rockery where the aviary is located.
This has been planted with nice small junipers so as to look like
cypresses. Between the junipers I have nice young heather, and
between the heather lots and lots of field flowers, the names of which
I do not know in English. There are bluebells, red, white, yellow,
and lilac flowers and some dwarf ferns. A basin I have made in front
of the aviaries out of granite blocks, surrounded by nature-stonework,
is also planted with strange rare mosses which bloom crimson, white,
yellow, and blue. Surrounding the basin are the only cultivated
plants in the whole garden, some Kamus lilies, tall ferns, and flowers
in various colours, spirea and water-swordgrasses. In midsummer
the whole thing looks like a colourful painting. I must here admit--I
have not done this by myself, a friend, artist and sculptor, planned the
whole thing, and we have done the work together. I did not want
to employ strangers to do it, because the real art would then not be
the same as when you do it with your own hands. A lot of love for
God's nature lies in this arrangement.
Above the aviaries I have built a large stone terrace from loose
stones and planted colourful flowers among the stones. The top of
the terrace, which is about 25 yards square, is a lawn. In the corner,
right up against the house, I have planted an aviary, made from
rustic birch, with colourful berberis bushes. There the Australian
finches belonging to my wife will go in summer. This aviary is
3 i by 3J yards and 3 yards high. There is a window into the
cellar (my cellar lies above ground), and inside in the cellar I have
partitioned off and made a bird-room where I have two flights.
One is connected with the finch aviary, 2J by 2J yards by 2 |yards
high, and the other somewhat smaller is intended to house a pair
of Ara sever a during winter. In the summer I will keep it for
eventualities.
In this bird-room I have my feed, a work-bench, shelves with my
mealworm boxes, and a battery of cages of the type in England
called " Budgie breeding-cages ". I use them for quarantine for new
arrivals and possible young ones, should I get more than I can

accommodate in other places. It is always good to have some reserve
place.
With the kind help of many of our members in the Avicultural
Society, and with special thanks to the Hon. Secretary, Mr. Prestwich,
for his helpful assistance, I have been able to buy quite a collection
this year. Most birds came from England, some from Denmark,
and one pair from Australia. I now have the following species housed
in my aviary :--
2/3 Rosella, 1/2 Stanley, 1/1 Princess of Wales, 5/3 Bourkes,
1/1 Roseate Cockatoo, 1/1 Ara sever a, 1/1 Rock Peplar, 10/10
Budgies (all unusual types), and twenty different finches, Red Cardinals
(with three young in the nest at present), orange Canaries, white and
grey Java Sparrows, Bengalese, Cordon Bleu, Grass Finches, Zebras.
These include this year's young.
I did not get the aviary finished before the middle of May, 1953. The
birds were practically all young ones from the previous season (1952),
but still I had the fortune of breeding eight young Bourkes, one young
Rosella, and a number of Zebras and Budgerigers. I have three
young Virginian Cardinals in the nest, and am trying to bring them
up on mealworms and egg food mixed with raw meat. I have little
hope, but will try anyhow. It is too late in the season. Had this
occurred in the summer, I would have let the grown birds out to catch
insects, they do not leave home when they have young ones ; I have
tried this once before with success.
I am very anxious to see how the whole collection comes through the
severe winter in the high altitude of Konnerud ; I live at 300 metres
above sea level, the air is thin and clear and dry. The birds seem to
thrive on the climate so far, and they have come into as good a condition
as can be expected.
I imagine space in the Magazine is limited, so will let this be enough.
At some later date I will relate something about the other bird-people
we have here ; they are few, but there are some that are very interested.

By C. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
The Black-crested Finch --Lophospingus pusillus --from the interior
of Argentine, was, as far as I know, first imported into Europe about
twenty years ago. In a consignment of South American birds I got
four birds, apparently two pairs, of a species new to me, and the
name was not known by the Dutch importer. I sent a description to
Mr. Karl Neunzig in Berlin, who gave me their name and particulars.
At that time I had no further results with them, and gave them to a
friend, who is specially interested in South American birds.
On a trip to the Continent in 1950 I was happy again to secure
five birds, two cocks and three hens. In an indoor-flight in my bird-
room in my house the birds behaved quite peaceably all the winter.
I should mention that one pair of the birds was obtained from a
private aviculturist, who had kept them in his somewhat roomy
birdhouse with an adjoining outside flight, in the company of various
small birds--Weaverfinches mainly--but parted with them because
they were rather aggressive towards other birds. The other three
birds were freshly imported.
In the spring of 1951 I put the first-named pair in an outdoor
flight with an adjoining closed-in room in the company of various
small finches and weavers, about ten pairs in all. The flight was
approximately 20 by 7 by 7 feet, the indoor compartment about
7 by 7 by 7 feet. I had no opportunity to follow the birds very closely,
but never observed that they were aggressive to other inmates. In
July I observed an open nest, cup-shaped and very deep, made of
coconut-fibres and lined with white dog hair. The nest was built
in a Harzer wicker cage and contained three eggs. As a pair of Canaries
also shared the flight I first thought that the nest belonged to those
birds, but later on observed that the Crested Finches visited the nest.
Two youngsters were duly hatched and reared. They left the nest when
about fourteen days old, but were fed by the cock for a long time, I think
about a month. The hen eventually settled down for another clutch
of three eggs from which two youngsters were hatched and left the
nest in due course. As far as I could see nothing but fresh ants' eggs
were used for feeding. I had a lot also frozen for later use, but when
the fresh ants' eggs, through some disturbance in the freezing-room,
were spoilt the fate of my four young Lophospingus was sealed, and
they all died, still apparently being dependent on this food.
In 1952 no attempts at breeding were made, and the old cock
died. In the spring, 1953, I got a new cock and mated him to
the old hen. As I was anxious to make some closer observations

I put the pair in a flight in the bird-room in the house situated close
to my office, so I had time to look at the birds at frequent intervals.
The flight is approximately 8 by 6 feet and about feet high. The
room also contained five or six pairs of other small birds, Red-headed
Parrot Finches, Zebra Finches, Cherry Finches, Cordon Bleus,
Avadavats, Green Avadavats, and Bichenow Finches. As nests,
Harzer wicker cages and small plywood boxes 5 by 5 by 5 inches, with
half-open fronts were used. There were not very many branches,
but they were sufficient. There was a big window facing south and a
smaller one facing east. All feeding receptacles, open shallow glass
feeders, were placed on a zinc plate on the floor, with the bathing
facilities as well.
The Lophospingus settled down quite quickly and started nest-
building in a Harzer cage. The nest was again mainly built of coconut-
fibres and lined with white hair from a wire-haired terrier (a very
good and highly treasured lining material easily obtained from every
dog trimmer). I am sorry I cannot give the exact date of the first egg,
two only were laid. One youngster was hatched on 4th May and
left the nest on 18th May, two weeks old. The youngster was not able
to fly up, but sat in a corner most of the time on the first day and
was regularly fed by the cock. Already on 20th May I observed the
youngster in one of the feeders, but am not quite sure if it took any
seed. Already the next day, 21st, the youngster sat on a rather high
branch, and on the following day, 22nd, it flew very well. Two days
later some bird, I did not know which, started to pluck the youngster
badly on the breast. Later on I observed it was the cock. This plucking
grew so bad that I had to separate the young on 1st June, by which
time it seemed quite able to fend for himself. I put him alone in a
box cage 30 by 14 by 18 inches, in which he soon regained his plumage.
He was feeding mainly on fresh ants' eggs and milksop, which also
had been used by the parents for feeding, also some sprouted seed,
millet and canary, and possibly some egg food was taken. Lots of
chickweed had been at the birds' disposal all the time, and probably
also used for feeding the youngsters. As far as I could observe the
young one was fed mainly by the hen for the first week, after which
time the cock also took part in the feeding. After leaving the nest
the youngster was fed only by the cock and ignored by the hen,
except that she also plucked it. As to the colour of the young bird,
this was rather similar to the hen, only with some irregular, not
very defined stripes down the breast. The crest was already clearly
visible before it left the nest. On the 29th July the youngster seemed
ill and died on the same day, as far as I could see, from enteritis.
Further mating was observed on 26th May and two eggs were
laid on 31st May and 1st June, but the hen refused to sit. Nest-building
was started again in the same Harzer cage and a new nest placed at

the side of the earlier one. On 25th June again two eggs were observed
and two young hatched on 5th and 6th July. One of these died on
12th July and the other left the nest on 17th July. This youngster
was not plucked, but had to be transferred to an adjoining flight on
8th August. This young bird--probably a hen--is still living at the
time of writing (22nd November), and is exactly like the old hen.
On 19th July a fourth clutch of two eggs was observed and two
youngsters hatched about 31st July, but died on 5th and 7th August.
The pair had usually behaved quite peaceably, but sometimes the
cock started to chase some bird--usually a Zebra Finch up and down
the flight. At length I had to transfer the Zebra Finches, as I wished
to observe the Lophospingus and would not disturb them. After the
fourth unsuccessful clutch the cock apparently thought it would be
better to have the room for himself and his wife, so he started in a
typical Cardinal-manner to chase now one bird, now another. As
the victims happened to be Red-headed Parrot Finches, Plum-headed
Finches, and Bichenows, which all had young I decided to catch the
pair and put them alone in a smaller compartment about 6 by 3 feet,
but of the same height as the previous one. This flight they shared only
with a pair of Painted Quail, in which they took no interest. In this
compartment they started to build a new nest in a Harzer cage and on
15th August two eggs were in the nest. Two youngsters hatched on
27th and 28th August, one of which died on 7th September, the other
leaving the nest on 9th September, apparently a bit too early. On
the same date the nest was transferred. As I had to go abroad on the
same day, my wife took over the care of that special pair and reported
to me that the young was plucked for a couple of days, but that
the plucking then stopped. Apparently the lack of opportunity for
further nest-building was the reason. On my return home on 26th
October all three birds were in good condition, but a fortnight later
the cock started to pluck and chase the young one, so I transferred
it to the adjoining larger compartment already mentioned. The young
bird had been damaged by the plucking of some of the primaries,
so that he could not fly very well and used to climb up the netting
to a branch. On these occasions the cock furiously attacked the young
one through the wires and still plucked its breast. I had now to
transfer it to the cage already mentioned, where it seemed to settle
down quite satisfactorily and the feathers were soon in order.
I now wonder whether the reason for plucking is that the parents
wish to nest again or that the cock feels that the young one is possibly
a cock. As stated earlier the other young one, now about five months
old, has not shown any signs of changing plumage, so it is probably
a hen. I should of course be very interested to have a young cock,
as there are, as far as I know, no data about the time the cocks moulting
out to adult plumage. I should also mention that it is certainly not

my custom to take five clutches in succession from one pair as a
general rule, but I was interested to see how many clutches this some-
what rare species would lay and I also was anxious to obtain more
youngsters in order to observe their development.
The description of the egg is as follows : slightly pointed, greenish-
grey, marked with streaks and spots of two darker shades, more
pronounced towards the larger end. Size 19-20 by 15 mm.
As stated earlier, the bird was first imported alive to Europe about
twenty years ago, again after the last war in 1949 in larger numbers
and probably from time to time since then, as it is sometimes advertised
in the fancy press.
As far as I know the Black-crested Finch was first bred by the late
Dr. Maurice Amsler in 1939 and later by Mr. Allen Silver, and in
1949 and 1951 in Switzerland by Professor Hans Steiner, who gives
a very interesting account of the breeding in Vol. 8 of Die Gejiederte
Welt , 1953. I do not think it is an easy bird to rear, it is just the same
thing as with many other species, that you must be lucky even to get a
pair which wishes to breed. For instance, my other cock has been
paired with both my other hens under exactly the same conditions,
but they have never made any attempts to breed. This shows the
wisdom of always getting several specimens of a species you are
anxious to breed.
The species was first discovered by Burmeister on his expedition to
the La Plata States in 1856, and later, in 1863, described in Journal
fur Ornithologie as Gubernatrix pusilla. In the Checklist, Vol. 12, Dr. R.
Bowdler Sharpe describes the bird as Lophospingus pusillus, but says
that the female is similar to the male. This, however, is wrong.
The sexes of adult birds are easily distinguished. The cock has a black
throat spot which is lacking in the female, and the stripes are more
clearly defined in the cock, also the breast colour is a trifle deeper. In
his large book, Die fremdlandischen Stubenvogel, Part I, 1879, Dr. Karl
Russ describes the bird as a Lesser Green Cardinal. In spite of the
fact that there is no green colour in the Lophospingus , there is a certain
resemblance between the two species, especially the female of the Green
Cardinal. There is, however, a very remarkable difference in size,
the L. pusillus being only 4.8 inches long and the Green Cardinal
7.5 inches.
Further notes written on 3rd January , 1334.
On 1 st December I noted the older chick--born on 5th July--
warbling with a very loud voice, and in a few days it was singing
loudly as the old cock. The chick started serious battles through the
wire-netting with his father in the adjoining flight, both plucking each
other on the breast. I had to transfer the bird to a box cage. At the
same time I observed a grey spot on the throat, growing each day, so

that a month later the bird had a patch almost as big as that of the old
cock. At the same time the grey stripes on the sides of the head have
grown darker, and are now almost black. Contrary to my earlier
belief, this bird is a cock, the moulting out into adult plumage seems
to start when the bird is about five months old and will be finished in
about six weeks.

By David M. Johnson (Port Orchard, Washington State, U.S.A.)
It is now a year since I made a report to the Avicultural Society on
facts observed in the breeding of my birds for the season. Fourteen
husky youngsters still survive in their j'uvenile plumage.
I will first, however, describe the eclipse in the hybrid cock which
took place in June, 1953 ; it would seem that the hybrid changes
more towards sonnerati with age. This cock lost his hackles,
and they have been replaced with short, rounded, flat black feathers.
The shoulders, formerly maroon red, are now showing the waxy webbed
character of sonnerati , but the shanks are still pink. Strangest of
all, one wattle has receded completely, while the opposite one has
moved towards the centre of the throat. This is most interesting.
It would not surprise me, if when this cock blooms again, perhaps in
August, the spotted hackles returned.
I have raised a few second-generation hybrids this season, only to
prove conclusively that the hybrid is fertile. Having to use a sister
hen and not having any fresh blood of a non-related stock, I have not
been anxious to breed from them. The eggs, though of the highest
fertility, did not hatch well.
The chicks were unable to break through the shell, and were at first
tiny and delicate. They were, however, strong enough after a week.
I have had reports from other States of poor hatches from pure
sonnerati , which causes me to wonder if lack of new blood is not a
strong factor in this case.
Now for the report of what I am pleased to call ec Gallus johnsoni"
These are the super birds derived from a three-quarter sonnerati cock
and a Cornish bantam hen. The pencilling is dark, the eggs were 100
per cent fertile, and all the chicks hatched out and lived. These chicks
were robust from the egg, docile and tractable yet with a certain
reserve, and with a hearty dislike of being touched or handled.
They were suspicious of danger and ever alert. The blend of these
two species is indeed harmonious. Half-grown pullets show many
of the attributes of sonnerati , including whitish breasts and throats,
tails carried low, as in both species, wings proportionately larger than
in the Cornish bantam, but with bones somewhat larger than in

the sonnerati. The length of leg gives a graceful carriage, and the
body is round and compact. The juvenile plumage resembles certain
grouse of the same age ; the feathering of all is perfectly uniform, the
heads are round, and there is no visible comb or wattle. None of the
females of any of these hybrids has the facial skin. The colour is rather
brown with the exception that just before a hen is laying there may be
a slight rosy tint at the tip of her very small pea comb.
At present the juvenile plumage of birds of the year is not like either
of the species from which they are derived ; it is rather distinctly its
own yet withal a pleasant blend of both. In some future issue of the
Avicultural Magazine I may be able to give a description of the
adult plumage of these birds. The cockerels have yellow legs and the
pullets green.
When considering the general characteristics of these birds it may
be of interest to mention that they are quite playful, but in sham
battles do not seem to hurt one another at all, and they are, in rapidity
of movement, not to be compared with the comparatively slow-moving
domestic fowl.
The three-quarter sonnerati cock would give one the impression,
in the early morning especially, that he had turned vicious, as he
delights in scaring the pullets of the year, frightening them until they
seek cover, when he promptly finds them and affectionately tugs their
neck and breast feathers, indicating that no harm is intended.
Our worst predators here are racoons which have become quite
bold, and the so-called civets or little spotted skunks, which steal eggs
and sometimes chicks, so that everything must be kept under wire.

By A. H. Isenberg (Woodside, California, U.S.A.)
On our first trip by motor to Mexico in 1945 I saw for the first time
live Ptilogonys at about 8,000 feet elevation between Mexico City
and Taxco. It was a wonderful sight to see these lovely, graceful
birds in their native habitat. There were about seven of them, and
they were feeding on some sort of berries on a tree with reddish bark,
not unlike our Madrone trees in California. Their pleasant call notes
were constantly uttered as they flew from the food tree to another,
back and forth. The time of year was April, so that the country was
extremely dry.
Upon arrival at Taxco my wife and I were wandering about the
fascinating old streets when we passed a seamstress' shop, and there, to
my great joy, was a fine pair of Ptilogonys in a very small cage.
No amount of persuasion and begging on my part would persuade

the lady who owned the birds to part with them, even though I
offered her ioo pesos (about $8.00). I was so excited and so dis-
appointed. We thanked the lady for letting us see her birds, and
asked where we might get some, and she said in the Mercados of
Mexico City. It was many days until I could test the lady's advice,
as we were on our way to Acapulco.
To make a long story short, I did finally manage to collect seven
Ptilogonys among other nice Mexican birds. The back of our car
was loaded with cages and birds on our home stretch. Two Ptilo-
gonys died on the way, leaving five upon arriving home. After a
week or more rest in a large cage in the " Loochoo Robin " aviary,
the Ptilogonys were released into the aviary.
The next year saw one pair carrying nesting material, but the
only result that year was that the male of the mated pair killed the
odd male, and eventually in 1947 I had only three left, a male and
two females. This was the year of my first near success, as I reported
in my article on the hybrid Clarin-Jilgearo, when one Ptilogony was
reared to the flying stage, but it died in the nest. No further attempt
to nest was made until this year, which is a peculiar thing.
In April, 1952, my wife and I again were on our way home from
Mexico, this time with another seven Ptilogonys and other birds.
Three of these were given to friends, and I kept two pairs which were
released in due course with my old pair. Ptilogonys evidently are
gregarious in nesting habits, as this year all three pairs had nests
and hatched young, but only one pair was successful in rearing one
young. As I write (8th August) the young bird is quite on its own, is
mostly grey, and does not show any yellow on its under tail-coverts.
Ptilogonys are rather late nesters, June being the month nest building-
starts, and the nest is constructed mainly of Spanish moss plus rootlets
and grasses and some hair and string, but without the Spanish moss
I don't think they would nest. Two to three eggs are laid (eggs are
bluish-grey, heavily peppered and speckled with dark brown) in the
open cup-shaped nest. The nesting sites varied in my case. One
pair built in a branch of Ceonotus (California wild lilac bush) about
seven feet up and right next to the aviary netting in full sun ; this
later proved the death of the young from sunstroke. Another pair
nested about nine feet up in a thick and well shaded trumpet vine ;
this young one simply disappeared. The third, and successful pair,
nested in a fork of a top branch of a long-needled pine tree about
nine feet up. This last nest was partially shaded. Two young hatched
here after approximately 14 days of incubation, the male took his
turn, and when not incubating would guard the nest quite well.
Territories were set up by each male, and not too belligerently
enforced, but I did feed them in four or five different places.
Ptilogonys, like Phainopeplas, feed their young on berries very soon

after hatching. I only gave mealworms two or three times a day, the
parents hawked quite a few insects, but fed the young mostly on
canned blueberries from which the syrup had been washed ; fresh
blueberries were also cherished when available, also soaked currants,
Philadelphia cream cheese also was taken. The giving of mealworms
presented a problem in such a mixed aviary. A pair of Indian Brown
Robins were particularly annoying, both in stealing the worms and
chasing the Ptilogonys away. The Robins built three nests in three
different nest-boxes, laid three eggs each time, but did not hatch any.
An Aztec Thrush was also a nuisance, but by quickly placing a few
worms in different places the Ptilogonys got enough. Ptilogonys are
not aggressive, and almost any smaller bird can frighten them off,
such as a Scarlet Tanager, the Robins, etc. Fresh figs are greatly
cherished by Ptilogonys, and, of course, elderberries. Apples and
bananas, hard boiled egg, and my Pablum mixture are also taken.
In our climate Ptilogonys are quite hardy, and seldom use the
shelter, even in rain and stormy weather. One year the temperature
got down to 11* F. but the days were sunny ; such extreme temperature
change, however, is fortunately rare here, 30-3 2* being the usual
extremes in winter, and not often.
Other near successes were : Grey-winged Blackbirds, one young out
of nest, but injured in its first flight, and later died at about three
weeks old ; one young Red-vented Bulbul almost reared, but died of
sunstroke during a very hot spell (these birds now have another
young about twelve days old) ; Blue-winged Sivas had young ; also
Silver-eared Mesias, Shamas, White Eyes, and Satin Bower Birds
had one egg ; also Spectacle Thrushes and Indian Rock Thrushes.
I just do not have enough aviaries for breeding. Next year I plan to
have a series of breeding aviaries where one pair of birds can be by
themselves.
Now (11 th September) the one young Ptilogony is doing very well,
and shows some yellow on the under tail-coverts.

By Kenneth Smith (Paignton, Devon, England)
The avian collection at Paignton Zoo has been increased consider-
ably during the past few years, particularly in 1953. It is still small,
however, if compared with the exceedingly rich and representative
collection maintained here by Mr. Whitley before the last war.
There are no comprehensive family exhibits here now, such as that of
the Birds of Paradise of bygone days. We have, nevertheless, many
interesting specimens, and we aim to increase the avicultural side
of the Zoo as far as circumstances will allow.
New arrivals are accommodated alongside old inhabitants. These
older birds are living reminders of former days when the Primley
collection could vie with any other avicultural establishment in the
world--of days, indeed, when in many respects it could not be excelled !
A pair of Great Condors have been at the Zoo for about twenty
years. At the end of last January and in early February mating
was observed, and on 26th February an egg was laid. The birds
were most attentive, seeming to share incubation duties fairly, and
my hopes were high. Maximum privacy had been ensured by fencing
off the whole range of birds of prey cages from the public, and only
the keepers directly concerned with the Condors' welfare were allowed
in the area. But, alas ! these precautions were of no avail, for on
3rd April the egg had gone ; taking into account the full circum-
stances I was forced to the conclusion that it had been destroyed,
most likely by the male. The day was Good Friday, and the noise
of the first holiday crowds, although not close, was disturbing.
Mr. Whitley told me that these Condors had succeeded in hatching
a chick some years previously, and all went well for a while ; then
the cock killed the youngster--though not intentionally--when he was
upset by visitors.
Caged next to the Condors is a pair of Chilean Sea Eagles, and on
the other side are three Brazilian Caracaras. There is also a very
tame Hooded Vulture, one of a number I brought from West Africa
in 1951. Probably the most unusual exhibit among our raptorial
birds is a Swainson's Buzzard (Buteo swainsoni), sent to us last winter
by Mr. Tom Baines, of Calgary Zoo. I know of no record of this
species being shown in Britain before. It is a choice feeder, and it is
stated that in the wild state it subsists largely on gophers ; our bird
takes freshly killed mice, young rats, and rabbit flesh.
Four fine American Eagle-Owls, also received from the Calgary
Zoo, are shown next to the British Little Owl, forming an amusing
contrast in size. A pair of Barn Owls reared a chick this summer, and

in the previous season two young were raised by the same pair of
birds.
The natural beauty of the Zoo, enhanced by subtropical trees and
shrubs, provides an ideal setting for Cranes. They do well in spacious
grass enclosures, where palms, bamboos, and other trees and plants
ornament the scene and offer shade and shelter. A mixed group
of Sarus and Demoiselle share the largest enclosure ; other Cranes
shown are Grey-necked Crowned, Japanese White-necked, and
Stanley. Geese, too, roam the enclosures, our stock including Cape
Barren, Egyptian, Canadian, and Abyssinian Blue-winged.
In January, 1953, we imported Black-necked Storks from India.
They are handsome dandyish creatures, much more elegant than the
Jabiru (the Jabiru I knew in the small Zoo attached to the old George-
town Museum was very dignified, but hardly elegant !), and in the
sunlight their darker plumage appears almost glossy. Black-necked
Storks, I think, need a good deal of care in an English winter, even
here in Devonshire. For extra protection against draughts and extreme
cold we have built straw-padded fencing around their winter sleeping
quarters. A notable eye difference, presumably of sex, occurs in these
Storks ; the larger bird, which I believe is the male, has an all-black
eye, while the smaller bird, presumed female, has a yellow iris and
black pupil.
Other large birds of note are Adjutant Storks, White Pelicans,
Black-footed or Jackass Penguins, and an Emu. In the aviaries
opposite the Storks' compound is a Spoonbill, which was found with an
injured wing near Teignmouth. I may say that during the past two
years I have had several reliable reports of Spoonbills observed in this
district, sometimes of twelve to fifteen birds flying together. One
of our keepers was fortunate enough to see a Spoonbill from the train
window when travelling along the coastal railway between Paignton
and Teignmouth.
The Sacred Ibis, Cattle Egret, and Vulturine Guineafowl are
other interesting species represented. The Cattle Egrets came from
the collection I made in the Sierra Leone Protectorate. In summer
they strut through the long grass in the aviary, arching and stretching
their necks as they search for insects, just as they did back in Africa.
The Vulturine Guineafowl were brought from Kenya by Messrs.
J. Seago and R. Bloom in November, 1952. They are now fully
acclimatized. At times they cavort around the aviary in quite a mad
manner, expressing it seems just the sheer joy of living ; their concerted
calls of excitement can be heard a long way off.
Oiled and injured sea birds are often brought to the Zoo for atten-
tion, some of them, of course, quite beyond recovery. We do what
we can to save them, but it is an exacting business if the injuries are

Bude and offered to London Zoo, were sent here recently on the advice
of Mr. John Yealland. We supplemented the fish diet with halibut
liver oil capsules. On moonlight nights I watched their shuffling
and scrambling gait, and now and again heard their wild penetrating
call.
The largest aviary in the Zoo, the Cottage Aviary, 50 feet by
44 feet, contains seed-eating birds. It gives splendid opportunity
for flight, while bushes and plant life provide a naturalistic touch.
Silverbills, Zebra Finches, Rose Finches, Bengalese, Red-headed
Buntings, Avadavats, Java Sparrows, and Canaries, as well as native
species, nest freely. In spring and summer the floral effect is delightful
and the activity among the birds causes great interest among visitors.
In adjoining aviaries are four kinds of Myna : Black-headed, Grey-
headed, Bank, and Pied.
The Parrot House collection is under the supervision of Miss Gladys
Salter. Macaws are well represented and include Spix's, Illiger's,
Severe, and Hahn's ; Conures include Blue-crowned and Golden-
crowned ; Parrots include Salvin's, Red-throated, and Maximilian's ;
and among the Parrakeets is the Green-winged King. Rarest bird
in the Parrot House is the beautiful Blue-eyed Cockatoo (Kakatoe
ophthalmica ), the survivor of a pair specially secured in New Britain
for Mr. Whitley by Mr. Shaw-Mayer. Elsewhere in the Zoo there
are Ring-necked Parrakeets which bred during 1953. A pair of richly-
hued hybrid Parrakeets (Barnard's X Rosella), which came from
Mrs. G. T. Clark's aviaries at Bromsgrove last May, is kept in the
Pheasantries. Here, too, are Indian Gallinules, also a fine Hunting
Crow, or Hunting Magpie, (Cissa chinensis ), a gift from Mr. A. A.
Prestwich.
Wild birds find the Zoo a virtual sanctuary. Buzzards soar or fly in
languid fashion overhead, often several in view together. Teal, Shoveler,
Pochard, Wigeon, and Mallard come to the lakes to join our water-
fowl (Carolinas, Bahama Ducks, Pintail, and Sheld-Ducks, in addition
to Mallard and some hybrids). Herons drop down to fish the shallows
of the lakes, Moorhens abound, and Water Rails skulk in the reed-
beds. Woodpeckers, Magpies, and Jays are common, and Gold-
crests flit unobtrusively through copses and plantations.
It is probably correct to say that there are more Peafowl at Primley
than anywhere else in Europe. Like the wild birds they enjoy complete
freedom here, roaming as they wish through the Zoo grounds and over
Mr. Whitley's private estates. They are left entirely to themselves at
nesting time and bring up their own young, no attempt being made
at hand-rearing. In springtime it sometimes seems as if one meets a
Peacock in display at every turn, each bird attracting a circle of
admiring visitors. The Peafowl roost in groups, and I often count
twenty to thirty birds in a single tree. The report of a gun or the

careless banging of a door in the still of a summer night often starts
them calling ; the raucous cries come from all directions, from every
roosting place it seems,some quite distant. It is a remarkable experience
to stand alone in the darkness in the centre of the Zoo, listening to the
tremendous volume of sound coming from the near-by trees and from
the wooded slopes beyond.
I have not, of course, mentioned all the birds in our collection.
To do so would have given this article a catalogue complexion even
more than it bears now. I have attempted to avoid this as far as
possible, and I hope I have not fallen too far short of that aim. In
conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the enthusiasm and meticulous
care shown by Mr. R. Travers, and by Major D. WilKs.-Fleming,
members of the staff; they are responsible, day by day, for the
welfare of the birds.

By Dr. George A. Allen (Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.)
As the civilization of a country becomes more mature its inhabitants
seem increasingly to recognize the importance that bird life plays in
the economy of their land. This is evidently more true of older lands
where the need for conservation is so great. Farmer and urban dweller
alike recognize that abundant bird life means fewer insect pests and
consequently better crops. Too, they appreciate more fully the
aesthetic value of birds, and take steps to ensure preservation and
propagation. There is apparently a direct relationship between the
knowledge and care of bird life, and the degree of culture in a nation.
When the older civilizations were at their peak, protective laws
were often enforced by the death penalty. Some birds, such as the
rare and beautiful varieties of pheasants, could be owned and held
captive only by royalty, and were therefore named the " Royal
Birds ". Feathers from those of rare beauty were only for the plumes
of the ruling class, and a violation of this law meant the most severe
punishment.
Evidence of esteem and admiration of avian life is to be found in
our museums, where the designs show birds woven into the most
delicate and costly fabrics. These, together with the rare paintings
which once could be possessed only by the wealthy, now come down
to us through the centuries as proof of the high appraisement these
feathered aristocrats enjoyed in those elegant days.
But nowadays in Europe birds are taken for granted as almost a
necessary part of most households. The city dweller with his small
backyard plot keeps some ducks, bantams, or pheasants for the
aesthetic value and animation which they lend to the oft-times drab

surroundings ... as well as for a possible treat for his Sunday appetite.
The home's interior is cheered by the presence of a multi-coloured
pet, or the voice of a captive songster. As the standard of living goes
up, the individual naturally has a wider selection of birds to choose
from. Those whose pocket books permit purchase the rare and exotic
types. However, those of less affluence equally share the desire for
better birds, and sometimes acquire them at the sacrifice of more
essential items. Though we human beings are often divided into
economic classes, there is little or no distinction between the artistic
judgments of bird lovers. The visual pleasure of an ornamental bird
reacts about the same on all human retinas, the world over.
In some oriental countries the birds are for sale in cages
of exquisite workmanship. American tourists delight in finding the
Mediterranean market places virtually alive with gay finches, warblers,
and canaries.
When Europeans settled the North American continent, wild life
was richly abundant. But the basic problem of survival demanded
people's full attention. Not until after the twentieth century began
did we realize the tragic rate at which we had dissipated our wildlife
resources, or the urgent necessity of restrictive controls. The years
1 goo through 1920, witnessed the extinction and near extinction of
several species of American birds. It was then, by the heroic efforts
on the part of enlightened citizens, that protective legislation was
passed to stem this growing calamity. The nation and the forty-eight
component states are all now fully cognizant of the need for stringent
protection, and are banded together in a great restorative movement.
The Federal Wildlife Agency protects the migratory birds. The
game commission of each state protects its upland game inhabitants.
These, together with the Audubon Society, the American Pheasant
Society, and numerous other groups, have created a public conscious-
ness of our feathered friends' place in our daily living. The few
ripples started by the breeze of protest against waste has by now
developed into a considerable wave of constructive action whose
crest rises higher year by year.
This surge of interest has now attained very noticeable proportions.
It is no longer considered a pastime for the effeminate. Lectures and
pictures on this subject are filling our auditoriums. Bookstores every-
where have new departments for ornithological literature. Even the
layman often buys the excellent new books of whose scholarly content
and artistic appeal America may be proud.
An interesting example is the magazine with which your author is
connected, the Pheasant Fancier&amp;apos;s , Game Breeder&amp;apos;s , and Aviculturist&amp;apos;s
Gazette. We began a little over a year ago with a mere bulletin ;
to-day it circulates in every state and territory of the Union. Other
journals are also well received.

24 G. A. ALLEN-IT's A " NEW WORLD "... FOR BIRDS
All this has resulted in a public demand for the unusual species.
This is being met partially by domestic breeders, but to a large extent
by importations from the corners of the earth. Europe&amp;apos;s exports to
the Western Hemisphere are increasing : but Africa, the Near East,
the Orient, New Guinea, Australia, and South America, are also
supplying an ever-growing number.
The Budgerigar is at present enjoying great popularity in the Ameri-
can home. Because of its friendly nature, ability to talk and ease in
propagation, it has made a market for itself comparable to any new
fashion fad. But, fashions change, and other species will gain equal
popularity. The exotic species of parrots are in ascendancy, and
rightly so, because of their brilliant colours and adaptability to
household training. And, of course, the canary is a classic pet.
Thirty-two years ago, my oriental pheasants took nearly every
prize ribbon the fairs here had to offer. But I must confess that they
were almost the only birds of their kind to be seen in this part of
America ! To-day oriental pheasants are familiar members of most
amateur collections, and certainly basic to every aviary. Any school
child knows them.
But even more remarkable is the new crop of organizations in this
field. In the past five years alone, over forty-five new groups have
organized with serious motives. Nor are we any longer considered
hobbyists. Congress must now reckon with bird enthusiasts as a first-
class pressure group ! Rightly or wrongly, one large society recently
has actually been a force in delaying the construction of a large
federal power dam project because its members feared this would
destroy a wildlife area !
Like their forerunners in Europe, the American scientific organiza-
tions and societies stimulate interest in the preservation of unusual
species, and keep the public informed on their care.
Yes, birds have achieved their place on the American scene. They
have come out of the laboratories and museums into our homes and
hearts. Breeding is now a recognized industry. Conservation is an
accepted responsibility. Collecting is almost a national habit. These
little feathered promoters put our best publicity experts to shame.
For, once properly introduced, they are a product which really
" speak for themselves ".
It will be some time before birds on this continent have the popular
understanding and respect which they enjoy in Europe. But there can
be no doubt that they now have entered a " new world ", and before
long will become equally endeared to the American people.

Some time ago my Fischer's Lovebirds (Agapornis fischeri) had five
babies. Usually I finger tame these funny little creatures much the
same as the young Budgies. There was one in the nest which seemed to
me to be particularly brighter than the others and I named him
Scampy. We spent a great deal of time together--he liked to cuddle
close to my neck and would run in and out of a paper bag retrieving
buttons and bottle caps I would throw in.
At the time I happened to be training two young Budgies and had
them with me the greater part of the day, sitting on my shoulder and
running around my neck from one shoulder to the other. Scampy
chose a place right under my chin to cuddle.
As he grew older he enjoyed perching on the play pen and became
unusually friendly with Buddy, our famous talking Budgie. Usually
Buddy enjoys the company of other birds, but being somewhat un-
certain how he would welcome Scampy, I watched very closely.
Unlike most lovebirds Scampy made no pretence of biting
Buddy's toes and apparently all was well for they got along beautifully
and were always together. This probably being the reason that
Scampy has learned to talk.
One day recently Scampy was on my desk where I was writing and
I was sure I heard him say a few words. Continuing with my work as
before and paying not the least bit of attention to him I watched him
closely. On my desk is a shiny brass calendar which intrigues him
immensely. Soon I heard him say " Pretty Boy " as plain as day. You
may well imagine my astonishment when I heard him utter his first
words.
He since has added " sweet " to this and I am anxiously waiting for
the rest of the sentence for I am almost sure he is trying to say " sweet-
heart ".
This has convinced me that birds taken from the nest early are far
superior as talkers. They have complete confidence in us at this early
age and show such devotion.
To my knowledge there is but one other lovebird that talked.
I believe he was a Peach-faced [Agapornis rosicollis) and owned,
if I remember correctly, by someone in England. I understand
this little fellow would sit on his master's shoulder, nip his ear, and
say " naughty boy ".

By Marvin L. Jones (U.S. Army, Germany)
Of the eight major zoos of Western Germany to-day, the finest
collection of birds is at Cologne. The zoo, having made the greatest
change from war destruction to modernness, also has an admirable
mammal and a small reptile collection. Not having the money of
some of its sisters in Germany, it has, through skilful bargaining and
business acumen, made a name for itself in the post-war zoo world.
Its Director since May, 1952, Dr. Wilhelm Windecker, has added
over 200 species of animals to the colony since his arrival, many of
which are not to be seen elsewhere in the Federal Republic. The
initial impression given to a foreign visitor is of a zoo that has suffered
very much, but is trying very hard to make good once again. The
buildings are for the most part very old and rather decrepit, but must
serve till funds will permit replacement. The Monkey House in par-
ticular is in the same style as i860, when it was opened, and some of
the cages seem older. Paint is needed as are new bars and retaining
walls, but the outside has been repaired quite well, and helps the
overall picture. Only the Bird House can be called new, even though
the shell of it was built in 1890. The interior is new, opened in the
summer of 1952, in the style of Bronx Park, minus the balconies.
The cages along one wall are for the larger birds such as toucans and
hornbills, while the opposite side has smaller cages for the weavers and
finches. All are wired in front and on the sides, and serviced from a
rear alleyway ; the wire and walls are painted cream colour and
help cheer up the place somewhat. At one end of the building is a
very large swamp type cage, with peat moss and a pool for the waders,
and at the other two cages for monkeys, with smaller glass covered
ones for the humming birds and sunbirds. These have plants and
limbs, while the larger ones have perches and leaves on the floor. In
one corner of the finch side are a series of glass-covered cages in tier
fashion, the bottom for mammals and the top for the parrakeets and
lories. The centre of the building has palms and benches for the
visitors. A very interesting exhibit of winter shelters for the wild birds
of the region is now being held in this space at the same time. The
other two exhibition buildings are the Elephant House, a very old
structure also, and the old Ostrich House made new as a combined
Reptile and Winter House for the birds. The entire collection of
reptiles is to be seen here in aquariums of varying size and varieties.
Some of these are home-made and are very nice, featuring growing
plants and dirt floors ; some have pools, but others no water. The
cages for the birds are of wire (reinforced) with connecting doors to

outdoor pens ; all are without tops, as are the pens. The centre cage
has a large pool and is for the flamingoes. Pools flank the wall and
create a more or less natural barrier to the cages for the crocodilians.
Scattered throughout the zoo are cages for birds, in temporary
fashion, as a new run for the pheasants and related forms is under
construction, and will be ready for occupancy by the end of December,
I953 &amp;apos;
For the waterfowl are provided two large lakes with adequate
breeding quarters ; these contain running water, so no danger of
possible stagnation exists. The cranes and the swans are in a very large
open lake area just near the main gate and about two blocks square.
Several of the animals and birds are afforded complete liberty, such
as the guans, tapir, and macaws. The latter have so far (the tempera-
ture has fallen below freezing on two occasions) been left out to seek
shelter wherever they wish. The macaws prefer an open branch while
the guans and tapir like thickets. None has so far proved of any
trouble, and no bites have been reported, despite large numbers of
children in the summer. Those in the zoo line can well understand
the tension that these little devils can create in liberty animals.
On clear days a parrot school is held on the lawn just outside the
Bird House and has proved a big hit with the visitors. It is very
surprising what the Amazons can be taught with a little patience.
In all fairness to the Frankfurt Zoo, which also has a very large
collection, Cologne has a better representation of the birds normally
kept in a bird house, while Frankfurt leads in Accipitriformes, flightless
birds, owls, and the herons. This zoo, however, lacks a good grouping
of waterfowl despite a very large lake, and smaller cage birds. Like-
wise its Bird House is very old fashioned in keeping many of its inmates
in cages similar to those used in pet stores, or very crowded. Both have
their merits and rarities, but in my opinion Cologne takes the lead
and has the finest specimens in plumage and colour. Taking them in
order seen and not scientifically, we have in the new Tropical
House a very nice male Eastern Cock of the Rock in full plumage,
sharing a rocky, tropical planted cage with a number of sunbirds
recently received from Africa, and as yet unidentified. This is the
only Cock of the Rock in Germany and one of few in Europe. Antwerp
has a female but no male. Sharing quarters in the same house are a
single specimen of the rarely seen Indian Adjutant and a pair of
Marabous, as well as a Saddle-bill, and one Secretary Bird. Pro-
ceeding along the walk toward the Bird House the next exhibit to
catch our eyes is the large cranes' enclosure, filled with East and
Western Crowns and Demoiselle, with a family of Mute Swans for
company. The usually unruly Andean Geese are also to be seen here
in the form of a pair, another pair are in the main waterfowl pond.
Both get along very well with the other birds in contrast to all published

reports on this rare form of Magellan Goose. Just beyond the old
bear dens and Lampeshausen, the village of rabbits, is the well-filled
main waterfowl pond or Teich as it is called in German. A well-
represented grouping is to be seen with many specimens which are
newcomers from the Tilburg Zoo. The rarest are the Ashy-headed
Geese, a young pair, and the typical Magellan Geese. A quartet
of Spot-billed Ducks, two of the Black-backed Comb Ducks, and all
the other waterfowl in the zoo are kept here, with the exception of the
Coscorobas, which are on a small pond with the Bahama Pintails
and the colourful Mandarins, Wood Ducks, and the Formosan Teal,
with their equally rare cousins, the Maned Geese of Australia which
are kept on a waterfall-made pond just in the rear of the main pool.
Now within view is the main Bird House, a strange-looking structure
reopened in 1952, and almost overcrowded with a well-rounded
collection. The outdoor flying cage contains the Trumpeters, rare
Orange-naped Imperial Pigeon, and Red-billed Green Fruit Pigeon,
as well as the Illiger's Macaw, Pileated Jay, and a fine Magpie
Jay of Central America. Flanking the two entrances are cages for
the birds of prey, wire fronted with gravel flooring, and providing-
adequate room for all but the Condors. This trio came from Tilburg
in the spring shipment, as did many of the collection. It is made up
of a mature male and two immature specimens, a male and a female ;
all get along very well so far. The Red Kite shares a cage with the
Kestrels, and the fine Bateleur, a male just coming into colour, is their
neighbour.
Once indoors the first sight is a mass exhibition of bill posters of
zoos from other parts of Europe ; several are from the Eastern Zone
and Holland. It is a very unusual thing to see a zoo boosting others
in such a manner. The main building is very large, about equal to
the London Zoo main building, and in the same style, except for the
lack of cages in the centre. All but four are wire-fronted and have
adequate skylighting, providing plenty of light even on rainy days.
The light-coloured walls and cage fronts (in contrast to the dark
greens and greys of many zoo bird houses) help this a great deal.
The collection is arranged in no definite manner, but according to
the neighbourliness of its occupants. Due to the limited number of
cages some, such as the finch and tanager cages, are so filled that it is
almost impossible to count the number seen.
Just right of the main door and proceeding in this manner, we first
come to four little picture cages for the humming bird, sunbird
(Tacazze), whiteeyes, and the sugar-bird. These are about
3x2x2 feet, and have painted backbrounds. They are serviced, as
are all cages, from the rear. That they agree with the inmates is proved
by only three deaths since their opening, and these were delicate
humming birds. A fluorescent lamp gives adequate light and shows

off the brilliant colours of the sunbird and humming bird very
effectively. The next series of cages are large enough for all to get
a good flight, and are for the larger types of birds. The fine collection
of Rhamphastines are kept here, as well as the hornbills. They are well
mixed, but agree with one another. The one toucan named ? is
a semi-adult bird called vitellinus by Windecker, but which appears to
be the same as oriel but with less red in the breast. I recall vitellinus has
a yellow and white breast, so until further checking will leave as it is.
The Ariels are very good and in fine colour, as is the young Toco. The
Concave-casqued Hornbills are a true pair without a doubt, and next
year plans are set to attempt to get them to build a nest and breed.
The formerly rare Hartlaub's Touraco, now seen in zoos all over the
world, share their cage with a fine Buttner's, another rara avis. Farther
down the line is one cage just full of pigeons and doves. Amongst
the rarer species are the Amethyst Pigeon of Jobi, the Brown Witch
Dove, and the Blue-headed Dove. All are great buddies and perch
together very well. One cage in this grouping is filled with the fine
myna collection, including the Lesser Hill, Bank, and Golden-crowned.
The latter has never been seen before by me in any zoo and I would
appreciate any comments on its previous exhibition. The end of the
building has a large swamp cage with planted trees and shrubs pro-
viding cover and perches for its many inhabitants. The Burmeister's
Gariama, never common, is here along with the Tiger Bittern and
Ypecaha Wood Rail, the not too often seen (not in Europe that is)
Florida Heron and Snowy Egret, and some Australian Crows (I don't
know the real common name), likewise never seen before by me. The
Red Bird of Paradise shares the next cage with the colies and the jays.
It is a male and is now in full plumage, the wire-like tail feathers a very
nice length. Among the many inhabitants of the crowded finch cages
are Versicolor Buntings, Blue-backed Manakin, Mountain Cardinal,
Green Cardinal, Diuca Finch, and Blue Thrush.
In the tanager cage the collection is comprised mostly of the smaller
species, such as Three-coloured Calliste and Violet Euphonia, with a
nice full-coloured Brazilian and a Black Tanager. The tier-arranged
cages which provide space for the small mammals on the lower level,
and birds on the upper, are the quarters of a pair of the Queen
Alexandra's Parrakeet, not seen elsewhere in Germany, two Orange-
fronted Gonures, and an excellent specimen of the Red-backed Lory.
The building has many more rarely seen forms and most of the
commoner ones. Just outside the Bird House is the Parrot School,
already mentioned, and the favourite tree of the at liberty Macaws.
A grand and unusual sight is the full plumaged Red and Blue Macaw
in full flight from this tree to another a full block away. The birds have
now been at liberty since early spring, and have never attempted to
stray from the zoo. Directly behind this open area are the new quarters

for the flamingoes, a natural swamp, which they seem to enjoy
immensely. In the winter they will be brought in, as ice is the main
danger, and usually forms overnight, when no one is around to
break it up. At the rear end of the zoo in an area, still showing the
ravages of war by bombing, are temporary cages for the pheasants,
and a range for the Emus and Ground Hornbills. The Leadbeater's
Ground Hornbill is one of the forms uncommonly seen. Returning to
the main zoo area are passed the cages for common European birds,
such as the Partridge and Tawny Owl. The majority of the rare
birds have been listed, but many others, such as the Baillon's Aracari,
Spot-billed Toucanet, Red-banded Aracari, Great Barbet, and the
Sonnerat's Junglefowl, could be described as such also.

certainly as good as any of the great shows that I can remember, and
I have not missed many, in fact we are told that it was a record,
a word I seem to remember hearing after every show I have attended.
No doubt it was so, chiefly from the enormous and ever-growing-
popularity of the Budgerigar. Canaries and Budgerigars occupied
practically the whole of the body of the hall, and for the foreign and
more interesting of the British birds one had to ascend to the spacious
gallery.
I am not particularly interested in Canaries nor, to any great
extent, in Budgerigars, since they have become as domesticated as
Canaries or poultry, but there is one particularly interesting point
about them, namely the extreme rapidity with which they have
become domesticated. I remember very well the first pair of blues
(or I think it was a trio) exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Hall
in November, 1910, by Mr. Pauvvels, of Belgium. They caused quite
a sensation as they also did when, with their owner's permission,
I showed them at a meeting of the Zoological Society. This was at
that time the only variety, except the yellow, to appear in the
Budgerigar, and now, forty-four years later, we see the bird changed
in size and present in a great variety of colours and combinations of
colour, and in this one show, numbering some 2,600 birds. This
shows what can be done in a very free-breeding species by careful
selective breeding. The Budgerigar is surely quite unique in the
way it has taken to a domestic life.
The class for Lovebirds and Parrotlets was well filled, mostly by

Fischer's Lovebirds. This is a fine species which I hope will not be
allowed to dwindle and die out, as has been the case with some of
the Lovebirds such as the Black-cheeks and the once common
Madagascar. There were some excellent Masked, Peach-faced, and
Red-faced, as well as Blue-winged Parrotlets.
There was a beautiful Golden-mantled Rosella which quite put
the Common Rosellas in the shade, a fine pair of the now very rare
Derbyan Parrakeet, some very good Stanleys, Plumheads, and Cocka-
tiels, as well as a grand pair of Queen Alexandras. I wish they would
not persist in calling this bird the "Princess of Wales' Parrakeet".
There has been only one Queen Alexandra, and it was in honour of
this great lady that Gould named the bird, although she was Princess
of Wales at the time.
Amongst the Lories and Lorikeets was a beautiful pair of the very
rare and pretty Musschenbroek's Lorikeets, as well as several of the
typical Lories. Hanging Parrots were represented by Blue-crowned
and Vernal. There was a good Hawk-head, two female Eclectus,
and a lovely Lear's Macaw.
There were two classes for the commoner Waxbills which were well
filled, while that for the rarer Waxbills and their allies contained
some such gems as Violet-ears, Dufresnes, Painted Finches, and others
not often seen. Parrot Finches, Gouldians, and other Grass Finches
were well represented.
Amongst other seed-eaters one noticed several species of Cardinal
and the American Evening Grosbeak, Yarrell's Siskin, Golden
Sparrows, and the rare Green Twinspot. I was interested to see a
pair of the charming Painted Quails, delightful birds for a grassed
aviary, but not suitable as cage birds.
The Zebra Finch seems to be becoming as much a domestic bird
as the Budgerigar. There were no less than four classes for it, one
for the normal type, one for " Cinnamon and Fawn," one for " White,
Cream, Silver, and Albino ", and the fourth for " Pied and any
other colour ". I must say the Zebra in the form and colour in which
Nature made it is beautiful enough for me.
The foreign soft-bills formed a grand collection. The humming-
birds of which some half-dozen species were shown, appeared to be in
excellent condition, and seemed to be enjoying themselves in spite
of the comparatively low temperature prevailing, though the manage-
ment had done everything possible to warm that part of the hall.
Sunbirds, too, were well represented by such showy species as the
Amethyst, Malachite, Tacazze, and Amethyst-rumped, a lovely
group which did not in the least find fault with their conditions.
Sugar-birds and Zosterops too looked very good, while the Tanagers,
both large and small, were in great force and of many species. They
are amongst the world's most colourful birds, but not more beautiful

than others we were still to see ; Niltavas in black and blue take a lot
of beating, and the pair shown had as their neighbours the Natal and
Cape Robin, both most attractive species. The Thrushes and Fruit-
suckers were also a nice lot with the very handsome Blue and so-called
Common Rock-Thrush, the Orange-headed, and Olive-backed
Thrushes.
Some of the Starlings are amongst the most showy of birds, and
here were nearly a score of these from the brilliant Long-tailed and
Purple-headed Glossy and the Spreos to the more sombre-hued
Pagoda Starlings ; and of their near relations, the Mynahs, we were
introduced to several that were expert talkers.
There were some good Toucans, Blue Pies, and Jays, and a class
of only two entries for Doves contained a pair of Barred and a pair
of the very pretty and rare Plumed Doves from the dry parts of
Australia, very desirable in an aviary where desert conditions can be
maintained, but not looking their best in a cage.
The last classes in a show of this kind are generally the most
interesting, and may produce some thrills, because they generally
contain birds that are quite out of the ordinary run. The three classes
concerned were for " All other " softbills (i) not larger than a Pekin
Robin, (2) Larger than a Pekin Robin, but not larger than a Glossy
Starling, and (3) Larger than a Glossy Starling. In (1) there were
Red-headed Manakins, delicate little black birds with bright red
heads, Blue-backed Manakin and Coppersmith Barbet. In (2) were
a pair of the rare African Jacana or Lily-trotters, birds only suited
to an aviary containing water-lilies, a Wilson's Bird of Paradise in
very good condition, a Blue-winged Pitta, Green-winged Malkoha
(a species of Cuckoo), Brown Thrasher, Babblers, and Barbets ; all
very rare birds. The last of these three classes contained the most
spectacular birds of all, namely three species of the larger Birds of
Paradise, a Greater, a Red, and a Twelve-wired, all in lovely condition,
though the last had broken off the delicate tail-wires from which the
species derives its name. The judges awarded to the Greater Bird
the prize for the best Foreign Bird in the show.
British Birds were well represented, with no less than six well-filled
classes for those bred in cages or aviaries. The breeding of British
birds in captivity has progressed steadily since foreign birds became
more difficult to obtain than formerly, and much can be learnt of the
breeding habits of even our commoner birds by this means, as was
proved by Dr. David Lack when he bred the common Robin in an
aviary.
British soft-bills were a lovely lot, such mites as Wrens, Willow
Warblers, and Tree-Creepers being in perfect condition, and proving
the great skill of their owners. This section was of great educational
value to all who wished to see, in the flesh, some of our least common

native species such as the Black and Common Redstarts, Shorelark,
Fieldfare, Ring Ouzel, Golden Oriole, or Great Grey Shrike. The
Waxwings were, as usual, looking sleek and beautiful. They are the
most contented of birds so long as they can gorge themselves on the
food they like. I used to find that soaked currants suited them very
well and did not make them too fat, which Waxwings are very inclined
to become.
On the whole, the birds were shown in suitable cages, though there
were some exceptions, but I would like to protest against the present
fashion of painting the bars of the cages white. If we painted the
wire-netting of our aviaries white, the birds would be practically
invisible, so we paint them black, and the birds show to perfection.
These white cage-fronts only dazzle the eyes and spoil the view of the
occupant.
From this brief and incomplete review it will be gathered that the
National Exhibition has been a grand show, splendidly organized by
the proprietors of Cage Birds , to whom all interested in aviculture owe
a deep debt of gratitude. It has been a great undertaking and we
are told that any profits are to be handed over to charity.

Lieut.-Col. C. L. Boyle showed the Carling Conservation Club

life history of the Ring-neck, introduced into Canada mainly for
sport, so it is perhaps not altogether surprising that it commences with
the shooting of several pheasants and ends in the same way. It, never-
theless, is of great interest and contains some really excellent close-ups.
J. C. Garratt showed his coloured film " Humming Birds ". The

Humming Birds, it shows many other birds in the aviaries at " Wych-

have bred eleven young, making thirty-three in three seasons. The
most interesting event has been one young Crimson-wing which I
hand-reared from three days old. The Crimson-wing egg was incu-
bated for two weeks under a big split-fallow Budgerigar hen, and
then completed by my Stanley hen, who refused to feed the youngster.
Hand-rearing has taken four months before the youngster was entirely
independent. However, it was well worth it as the youngster is strong
and healthy and, of course, very tame."

I must ask you to make a correction in the next issue of the magazine.
In the last [1953, 176] I stated that Sir Edward Hallstrom had bred
the Red-eared Conure ( Pyrrhura cruentata) last year. I have recently
seen the true P. cruentata (a very lovely bird) at Wassenaar, and it
is certainly not the bird Sir Edward bred. I rather think now that
it was the Red-bellied that he bred, but I will try and confirm this

Dr. E. Beraut writes from Rio de Janeiro : " My collection of
Humming Birds is still doing well. I possess one Heliactin cornutus in
wonderful plumage, a young bird which has moulted in my aviary,
and my best bird. I believe I now know the best way to keep the
more difficult species : Heliactin , Heliothrix , and particularly Pygmornis,
which live and moult perfectly, mostly thanks to a massive production
of fruit flies ( Drossophila ).
" I also use a new way of transportation ; instead of putting the
Humming Birds in a cage, which creates difficulties in airplanes,
I place each of them in a small bag of cloth with a small hole for the
head to stick out. They are thus obliged to keep quiet and do not
become exhausted. Every hour, I take them out of the box where
I keep them during the trip and make them drink. They can travel
for twenty-four hours under such conditions without being tired."

years, both at first-hand and through the experience of his trusted
aviary attendants in France.
The encouraging tone of the book, as evidenced by such sentences
as " All the pheasants, with very few exceptions, live and breed well
in captivity ", should go far to make recruits for the hobby and sport
of pheasant-keeping. Moreover, the suggestions for keeping these
handsome birds are of such a useful and practical nature as to enable
almost anyone to apply them with satisfactory results.
The descriptions of the various species are very compact and to the
point--sufficient to enable the reader to recognize and identify them.
The accompanying black-and-white illustrations are excellent close-up
photographs of birds in typical poses ; they enhance the practical
value of the text measurably.
Detailed suggestions for the construction of runs, shelters, etc., are
given, all based on actual and successful experience. The sections
devoted to breeding and to feeding are especially good--two phases of
pheasant-keeping which must be mastered to make a success of this
fascinating pastime or business. Of special interest and value is the
chapter entitled " Pheasant Health and Disease Control ", con-
tributed by Dr. Jungherr, who heads the Department of Animal
Diseases at the University of Connecticut. One of the most valuable
aspects of this handy up-to-date book is the excellent bibliography
printed at the end. It enables the reader to delve more deeply into
whatever phase of pheasant-keeping happens to intrigue him.

PARROTS EXCLUSIVELY. By Karl Plath, Curator of Birds,
Chicago Zoological Park, Cessa Feyerabend, and Dr. Irving
E. Altman. Illustrated. Fond du Lac, Wisconsin : All-Pets
Books, Inc., 1953. 54 pages. $1.25. (Exclusive British Dis-
tributor : Bailey Bros, and Swinfen, Ltd., 46 St. Giles High
Street, London, W.C. 2.)
This well-illustrated book, with colourful paper cover, is repre-
sentative of the practical guide-books which All-Pets, Inc., is issuing
in increasing numbers. Three authorities, each one thoroughly
conversant with his or her subject, have pooled their experience and
their knowledge to produce this handy and highly informative book
on parrots, which are now in their hey-day of popularity both in
Europe and in the United States.
Following his introductory comments on feeding, caging, and
breeding, Karl Plath describes in pithy, specific language the different
species of parrotlike birds, beginning with the Amazons, followed
by the Macaws, Conures and other American parrakeets, Lovebirds,
Cockatoos, and, finally, Cockatiels. Some excellent black-and-white
illustrations enhance the text noticeably.
The section devoted to " Personality and Training 55 is indeed
interesting, dealing as it does with the remarkable ability of parrotlike
birds to respond to human training, and citing many fascinating and
some unique instances of unusually well-trained birds. The reader
is given practical suggestions as to which species of parrotlike birds
are likely to become good talkers, when they should be purchased,
and how they should be taught.
The final portion of this handy book presents practical hints on
how to keep your parrotlike birds in good health for many years. It
is therefore one of the most important in the book ; it was written

Breeding Ocellated Turkeys at the Rotterdam Zoo
With reference to my information in this Magazine, No. 5, Vol. 58, September-
October, 1952, it may be of interest to mention the breeding results obtained in 1953.
The hen (of the same pair) laid from 13th May until 18th June (rather late in the
season) 14 eggs, all fertile. Ten chicks hatched, five of which had bad (crooked) toes.
Eight chicks were raised, the two that died were faultless. The sex-ratio was about
fifty-fifty.

THE MASKED FINFOOT ( Heliopais personata)

<bodyText confidence="0.929205857142857" page_id="56238165"  page_num="39" year="" vol="">
I write to inquire if any member of the Society can give any information as to the
above bird. Has the Finfoot ever been bred in captivity, and for that matter has it
ever been shown in a U.K. zoo ? I think, am not too certain, I once saw a Finfoot
fly across a stream in Upper Assam. But I have never seen it in captivity.

MOUSTACHE OR BANDED PARRAKEET ( Psittacula a.fasciata)
This bird is very common in India. In captivity it seems difficult to breed, at
least not many definite successes have been recorded. I put this down to the fact
it does not stand captivity very well.
I have lost, I suppose, nearly a dozen birds in the last two years. Only one did
I manage to keep alive for any length of time, a female which I had for nearly that
period. All the rest died during the quarantine period I always give to new birds
on arrival, or within the next three to four months.
And always the same complaint--pneumonia--save one killed in a hailstorm.
At least the symptoms are those of pneumonia. I have no post-mortem facilities here.
The bird is in rude health one minute, sick the next, and dead within 6-8 hours.
All the pneumonia symptoms as set out in Tavistock's Parrots and Parrot-like Birds.
My last two casualties were quite recent. As soon as the birds showed signs of illness,
I treated them with Sulphamethazine, but to no effect. The disease is so rapid the
drug seems to have no time to take effect.
But what causes the disease ?
I was and am anxious to breed Moustache Parrakeets. I like the birds. But they
have beaten me. I just cannot keep them alive, and I think I am not alone in this.
A certain zoo in India seems to have the same trouble, at least I have noted a succession
of these birds, following on casualties presumably. And it cannot be the climate,
chills etc. ; P. a. fasciata is indigenous.
Can any member of the Society throw any light on how to keep the Moustache
Parrakeet in good health in captivity ?

I have read the letter from H. Wildeboer in the Avicultural Magazine, Novem-
ber-December, 1953, referring to my Parrotlet article. Of course I have read
Neunzig several times, but I can only say that perhaps he is speaking about another
sub-species of the Parrotlet family. The legs of all my birds are of nearly the same
colour, differing only a little from flesh-coloured to greyish flesh-coloured, but not
according to species. My Green-rumped Parrotlets are not bigger than my Blue-
rumped ; if two old cocks perch side by side, the Blue-rumped looks definitely the
bigger.

I have been successful with my Red-bellied Conures (Pyrrhura frontalis) this year.
The hen laid in June, and after incubating for approximately 30 days, hatched
out two young in the first part of July, which left the nest 45 days later. The hen
incubated alone, but the young ones were fed by both parents. They used dry seed,
sprouted seed, and mostly ripe apple and pear as rearing food.
When the youngsters left the nest they were fully feathered, nice birds very much
like their parents, but a little duller in colour and with shorter tails. The parents,
especially the cock, fed them for nearly a fortnight after they had left the nest. The
old birds did not feel inclined to start a second brood, but after a month or two the
hen became very bored with the youngsters, and I transferred them to another cage.
The breeding cage, only 80 cm. long, was placed in my bird-room with a nest-box
(formerly used for Bourke's) placed outside.

(Sialia currucoides)
By Kenneth A. Norris (Purley, Surrey, England)
Owing to the very strict protection of the Blue Robins in their
native countries of Canada and North America, these birds are
familiar only to the few aviculturists in England who have been
fortunate enough to procure the few specimens which have so rarely
been imported during recent years. Of the three species, Sialia sialis,
S. mexicana, and S. currucoides , the latter is probably the least known.
Its range includes Western North America and Canada, from the
West Coast east to Manitoba and north to the Yukon and Mackenzie
Valley. During the past few years it has been extending its range
eastward and is said now to be more or less well established as far as
central Manitoba.
According to Taverner's Birds of Canada , its choice of nesting sites
is very varied and it is equally at home in the hollow cornices of
buildings, dead tree stumps, old Woodpecker holes in telegraph posts,
or in nest-boxes hung about the buildings and trees of the prairie
homesteads. In wild barren country it is found nesting in crannies in
the rocks and cliffs--in fact, its only requirement seems to be a suitable
hole to shelter the nest, irrespective of where it may be.
Mr. Reid-Henry's excellent portrayal of a pair of adult birds and
one of their young renders a detailed description of their plumage
unnecessary. It will be seen that they have much longer flight feathers
and tail than our own familiar Robin, the legs being comparatively
short and set well back on the body. As a result, their movements on
the ground are awkward and the wings are used constantly to assist
progress.
When resting on some favourite post or branch they assume an
upright posture, the legs and feet being completely covered by the
lower breast feathers, and in this position they more closely resemble

42 K. A. NORRIS-THE BREEDING OF THE MOUNTAIN BLUE ROBIN
the Flycatchers in appearance. They will " hawk " after any flying
insect which may come within range and seldom fail to catch a meal-
worm thrown into the aviary. Their remarkable agility on the wing,
combined with their general structure and rather flattened beaks,
suggests that, in a natural state, they must subsist largely on insects
taken on the wing.
I was fortunate enough to receive an adult pair of these very lovely
birds in June, 1952, and, as is my usual practice with new arrivals,
they were housed in a large cage in the bird-room for the first month.
They settled down quickly and took readily to insectivorous food
with the addition of a few gentles and six mealworms each, per day.
As weed seeds and soft fruit are said to form an important part of
their diet in a wild state, these were also supplied at first, but the birds
have shown no inclination even to sample them and they have since
been discontinued.
In July they were moved to an outdoor, unheated aviary, measuring
9 feet by 5 feet, of which 3 feet is entirely enclosed to form sheltered
sleeping quarters, the remainder being open wire flight, fitted only
with artificial perching. This aviary they shared with Cedar Waxwings,
an American Crossbill, and a pair of Golden Pheasants, but as the
latter soon formed the habit of flying up to the various food dishes,
either upsetting them or consuming all the food before the smaller
birds had fed, they were subsequently removed.
The Robins remained in this aviary throughout the autumn and
winter. Early in the following April the hen commenced to carry
nesting material to an open-fronted nest-box measuring 6 inches by
4 inches by 6 inches, which was hung in the open flight, beneath the
overhanging eaves of the sleeping quarters.
From past experience I have found it important, if success is to be
achieved under artificial conditions, not only to provide suitable
nesting sites but also the actual materials with which a species is
accustomed to build, especially for the lining of the nest. A striking
example of this had been provided by the Cedar Waxwings, which
had nested in the same aviary the previous year. These birds, which
had arrived in immature plumage, proved to be inexperienced in the
art of nest construction, even failing to bind the materials successfully
in a shallow woven cradle that had been provided as a foundation.
As the hen was obviously on the point of laying, I decided to assist by
supplying a " pre-fab ", using for this purpose a very substantial
Robin's nest from which the young had recently flown.
This the Waxwings accepted with every sign of satisfaction until they
discovered the hair lining which was evidently not according to
Waxwing specification, for together they stood on the edge of the nest
and literally ripped it out. They then quickly collected a quantity of
small scarlet feathers shed by the Golden Pheasant and with these

K. A. NORRIS-THE BREEDING OF THE MOUNTAIN BLUE ROBIN 43
formed a new lining to the nest in a remarkably short time, the first
egg being deposited on the following day.
I was unable to find any description of the Blue Robin's nest in the
books I had available and as soon as it became apparent that the hen
intended to build, I supplied a variety of materials, including dead
leaves, moss, fine roots, strips of birch bark, partly dry grass, small
twigs, short lengths of soft hemp string, hair, and feathers. From this
assortment she selected only the grass with which she formed a flimsy
nest, lining it with finer grass.
She laid four days after commencing to build and incubated steadily
for sixteen days, after which she left the nest and on investigation I
found it to contain only one pale blue, unmarked egg, which was
infertile.
This was no surprise as the cock had completely ignored the whole
proceedings and had, in fact, displayed some hostility to any close
approach of the hen during the early stages of building.
During the second week of May, however, he started to display,
perching near the hen, in a crouching position with wings held partly
extended and fluttering, thus showing to full advantage the brilliant
blue of his upper parts, or hovering before her, with a blade of grass
in his beak. Between displays, he constantly sang, or perhaps it would
be more accurate to say " warbled ", for so soft and sibilant were his
notes that often only the movement of his throat revealed that he was
singing.
Whenever mealworms were thrown into the aviary, he dexterously
caught them in the air as a Flycatcher would take gnats or other
winged insects and then, hovering directly above the hen, would offer
them to her. Should she fail immediately to accept, he would gently
tap her on the back with his feet. If she still failed to respond, he would
then alight beside her and thrust the insect towards her until she took
it in her beak. Even then it would sometimes be passed backwards and
forwards several times before the hen finally swallowed it, and it was
not until she had accepted three or four insects in this way that the
cock would himself feed. Thus encouraged, the hen again commenced
building, assisted occasionally by the cock who, however, did little
more than carry nesting material which he passed to her at the entrance
to the box, never himself entering or attempting to take part in the
actual construction of the nest.
On 19th May she commenced incubation and although she usually
left the nest when I visited with mealworms, she invariably returned
almost immediately, nor did she ever appear when anyone else
approached the aviary.
On 2nd June it became evident that young had hatched and both
birds started carrying mealworms and gentles to the nest, having first
prepared them by well chewing them between their mandibles until

they were limp and lifeless. Up to six were carried in the beak at a time
and were very quickly distributed.
Dr. A. G. Butler, describing his success in breeding the Eastern Blue
Robin, S. sialia, states that his birds never gave the young food which
was not partially digested, feeding them from the crop, on a mixture
of insects, vegetable, prepared insectivorous food, and also half digested
and softened seed (.Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary , Part I, p. 25).
My birds never swallowed the insects and although they took prepared
food readily before the young hatched, this was completely ignored
when feeding commenced. Only live food was then taken and was fed
by the beak and not by regurgitation.
Feeding continued for ten days and then suddenly ceased and the
parent birds appeared to lose all interest in the nest. Examination of
the nest-box and a thorough search of the aviary failed to reveal any
signs of the young birds. On the following morning I noticed that the
box was almost completely filled with hay and found that mice had
taken possession, no doubt having dragged out the young birds and
carried them below ground during the previous night.
Towards the end of June the cock again started to display and within
a day or so the hen was building in a similar box, hung in the sleeping
quarters, in a position which was fortunately inaccessible to mice.
On 2nd July she commenced incubation for the third time and on
the 17th July both birds were again carrying food to the nest.
Until now the Robins had taken little notice of the other inmates
of the aviary but possibly due to the loss of their previous brood, they
suddenly became aggressive, particularly towards the American
Crossbill. They continually drove it from perch to perch until the
cock finally succeeded in pinning this unfortunate little bird to the
ground where it commenced systematically to tear the feathers from
its back, and would undoubtedly have killed it had I not been in time
to separate them.
Having removed the Crossbill to another aviary, I thought it
advisable also to remove the pheasants in order to ensure that the
Robins should have all the food they required but the Waxwings were
allowed to remain as, strangely enough, these birds were still com-
pletely ignored by the Robins nor did they ever attempt to approach
the nest or interfere in any way.
After the birds had been feeding for a week, I ventured to look into
the nest when the parents were out in the flight collecting insects, and
found it to contain three small young, clothed in dense black down,
relieved only by the conspicuous yellow line of the gape.
At this stage, the hen began to display resentment towards the cock

K. A. NORRIS-THE BREEDING OF THE MOUNTAIN BLUE ROBIN 45
During the second week I again looked in the nest, to discover that
the young had made quite remarkable progress and were well fledged,
the colouring being very similar to that of the adult hen except that
the breast was heavily spotted.
On 7th August I noticed the three young sitting, crowded together,
in the entrance to the nest box. As soon as they saw me they slipped
back and crouched in the bottom of the nest, but on the following
morning one was on a low perch in the open flight and in the early
afternoon it was joined by the other two.
As soon as the young left the nest, the hen again allowed the cock to
approach them and both birds fed them at frequent intervals, no longer
troubling to prepare the food but thrusting the wriggling insects well
down the youngsters' throats. If an insect was inadvertently dropped,
it was immediately retrieved by one of the parents and again thrust
into an open beak and it was particularly interesting to note with what
care each young bird was fed in turn. On no occasion did I see one
bird receive a double dose, however clamorous or persistent it might be.
Just a week after the young appeared in the open, they commenced
themselves to pick up insects, deliberately dropped in front of them by
the parents and very soon afterwards became quite independent
although the old birds continued to shepherd them into a sheltered
position each night.
On 12th September and without any perceptible moult, intense blue
began to appear on the wing butts of two of the young birds, and on
15th September I noticed blue also appearing on the crown of the
head, immediately above the beak, followed a few days later by odd
blue feathers on the breast.
The third bird remained unchanged in colour but the spotting of the
breast began to fade and it was now obvious that there were two cocks
and a hen. At this stage fighting commenced between the old and the
young cocks and although I imagine that the adult bird was the
aggressor in the first instance, the young soon became equally ready to
start trouble, especially at feeding time. The old birds were already
moulting heavily and I therefore caught up the young and placed
them in a large cage in the bird room.
As soon as the young had been removed the parents resumed their
normal daily consumption of prepared food and the live insect supply
was reduced again to a small number of gentles and six mealworms
each.
I subsequently disposed of one young cock but the remaining pair
are still together and are doing remarkably well. The plumage of the
cock has changed little since he was transferred from the aviary and it
is now apparent that he will not assume his full, adult colouring until
he undergoes his first complete moult but the young hen is practically
indistinguishable from the old bird. Until recently they refused all

food except live insects, but are now taking a certain amount of
insectivorous mixture and occasionally a very little finely chopped date.
During the whole period of nesting and rearing, nest sanitation was
strictly observed, the excreta being removed by the parents and all
deposited on a cross-bar of the flight door, the most distant point
from the nest to which the birds had access. Even when the young
left the nest, this habit of " clearing up after a meal " persisted for
a few days, the old birds collecting and removing the excreta from below
the perch on which the young were sitting.
Gentles and mealworms, in equal proportions, were the only live
food supplied from the time of hatching until the young were removed
from the aviary and were consumed at the rate of four ounces per day,
an average of 1,020 insects a day continuously for nearly eight weeks
and this by an abnormally small brood !
Under natural conditions, a brood probably consists of four to six
young and I imagine the birds would be double brooded and might
even produce three broods in a favourable season.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the benefit derived from the
presence of these and other small insectivorous birds in agricultural
and fruit growing areas is inestimable and the strict protection afforded
them by the Governments of Canada and America is more than fully

NOTES ON THE CYANISTIC PHASE OF
INDIAN RINGNECK PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9786065625" page_id="56238178"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
By David West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
Colour variations among normally green birds do not seem to be of
a too rare occurrence. The amazing little Budgerigar occurs in dozens
of colours, and other birds with large areas of green plumage which
appear subject to variation are Masked and Nyasa Lovebirds and, (
in addition, there are Plumheads, lutino and blue phases of the Alexan-
drine, and lutino and blue phases of the Indian Ringneck Parrakeet.
The earliest references to this colour phase appear in the ig2o's in
the Avicultural Magazine and Hachisuka's Variations Among Birds.
From published information it appears that at least one, and more 1
likely two, blue examples of the Indian Ringneck Parrakeet were kept
by a Mr. M. G. Mallick, of Calcutta, during the 1920's. From conversa-
tions with people who saw these birds in India it would appear that &amp;gt;
both birds were cocks, were kept in individual cages, and that no
attempt was made to breed from them in order to perpetuate this
colour phase.

Continuing chronologically, the next reference to blue Ringnecks is
the 1941 record of the example which Mr. Sheffler raised in his
Arizona aviary. This bird was reared from normal parents, and it was
a great tragedy that it was killed when only a few weeks old when
Mr. Sheffler tried to catch it for removal to other quarters. Although
the parents of this bird were kept for twelve years they never again
repeated their 1941 success. Mr. Sheffler recently told me that this
bird, like those currently in England and in California, was powder-
blue in colour.
After the end of World War II there is a notation in the Avicultural
Magazine of an English soldier seeing a blue Ringneck among a flock
of green ones while on duty in India. An American dealer also told
me that during a 1949 trip to India he saw a tame and talking blue
Ringneck which belonged to a poor Indian farmer. Although repeated
attempts were made to secure the bird nothing eventuated and the
dealer was forced to give up the idea of securing this bird. There is
always the possibility that this bird might have been useless for breeding
purposes if it were too tame.
During 1950 two blue Ringnecks were offered by an Indian dealer
to a Californian fancier for the sum of $1,000. At this time it was
believed that they were the only pair in captivity anywhere in the
world. As if the price were not enough of a drawback American
importation regulations would have made it virtually impossible to
secure the birds anyway, so rather regretfully a negative answer was
sent back to India.
Although I have no valid information from the late Duke of Bedford
it would appear logical that the pair of blue Ringnecks he secured
from India through the efforts of Mr. A. Ezra in 1950 were this same
pair offered to the Californian fancier. The Duke mentions in an
article that this pair consisted of an adult male and a young female
and that neither bird appeared to have been in captivity very long.
One cannot help but wonder if these birds were wild caught, or is
there someone in India breeding blue Ringnecks ?
Certainly the pair sent to Woburn did very well for they reared
a total of eleven young in three seasons. The actual numbers were as
follows ; in 1950 an interest was shown in the nest but the female was
too young and nothing eventuated ; in 1951 three were reared ; in
1952 four were reared ; and in 1953 another four were reared. In the
1953 season a blue cock mated to a lutino hen also reared two green
youngsters.
The possible colour variations made possible by correctly mating
the lutino and blue phases will certainly open a new field of endeavour
for the aviculturist. An albino Ringneck is now a distinct possibility
and should be a really lovely bird if it retains the red bill and the pink
ring about the neck. Now that the Keston Foreign Bird Farm has

succeeded in breeding a nearly pure lutino Alexandrine (by mating
a female lutino Ringneck to a cock Alexandrine and then mating the
split sons back) the same method could be used to produce a blue
Alexandrine and then with these lutino and blue Alexandrines an
albino Alexandrine could be anticipated.
At the present time there are just thirteen blue Ringnecks in
captivity. Of this number four birds are here in California, eight are
in England, and one on the Continent. One can only hope that they
will all continue to prosper and that soon their present " unlucky "
number will be a much higher figure.

Supplementing Mr. West's notes, there are nine blue Ringnecks in
this country. If his information regarding one being on " the conti-
nent " is correct there are therefore more than the " unlucky thirteen "
in captivity.
When the late Duke of Bedford's collection was so lamentably
dispersed, the original breeding pair passed into Mr. Boosey's care.
The 1950 trio, one hen and two cocks together with the two 1953 green
young bred from a blue cock and lutino hen were acquired by Mrs.
Clark, of Bromsgrove, and the four remaining immature birds came to
Ballinger.
It is hardly necessary to say that every effort is being made to
establish this magnificent colour variation. This desirable goal will
take time to achieve in view of the lengthy period taken to attain
maturity and the difficulty of sexing birds in the meantime. There is
also the desirability of introducing unrelated blood which of necessity
must either be normal or lutino strain since there are no other blue
birds available so far as is known.
One other point is worthy of mention, namely that in 1934 our
president, Mr. Ezra, successfully reared a blue Alexandrine. The
parents were a blue cock mated to one of his daughters by a normal
hen.

Although, like most bird-watchers, I had long admired the beauty
of the Red-legged Partridge, Alectoris rufa , it was by a pure accident
that I first started keeping these birds. Wandering with a friend
along an overgrown bank at a local sewage farm one morning in late
July, 1952, I nearly stepped on an incubating Red-leg. As it flew
off it became entangled in some weeds and struggled frantically for
some seconds before it succeeded in tearing itself free. On our return
at 6 p.m. we were, therefore, hardly surprised to find it had not
returned. We decided to give it another 24 hours, and in the mean-
time I inquired frantically, but in vain, for a broody bantam, and
I had to use a large black hen, the only broody obtainable. The
following evening the Partridge's nest was obviously deserted. One
of the eggs had been removed, and was lying--unharmed--several

yards away. I took all eight, and put them under the hen, and after
four days they started to chip. Soon two had " caved in " with the
weight of the hen, and all would doubtless have been crushed, but by
good luck a broody Cochin bantam was procured just in time. This
bantam had only begun to sit some eight hours before, but she reacted
appropriately to the hatching eggs, sitting " lightly " and " talking "
tenderly to the unhatched chicks. Of the eight eggs, five hatched,
and the two somewhat flattened ones--from which, of course, the
chicks could not extricate themselves--I successfully opened at the
correct time. The eighth egg contained a dead chick. The net result
was seven strong and healthy chicks, which, as the well-developed
eggs had been left deserted and cold for some thirty-six hours, was
rather remarkable. The newly hatched chicks were the most
delightful objects, in soft buff and brown down, their rather short and
sturdy legs being dull yellow, spotted with blackish, a rather unusual
colour scheme. I had feared that the chicks might be as hard to
rear as Common Partridges, which are said to be even more difficult
than the pheasants of the Phasianus group. Luckily this was not the
case, and the young Red-legs proved as easy to rear as Golden
Pheasants.
They were kept on the lawn in a pen, which was moved daily. At
first the young Partridges could slip in and out through the one-inch
mesh, and two vanished at this stage, doubtless carried off by some
predator. At about five weeks old the young birds had begun to find
the narrow confines of the pen irksome. They were liable to panic
at a sudden approach (especially if one's lower garments or footwear
was at all unusual)--and spent much time running up and down the
wire. They were then moved to a large aviary (about 20 feet by 40
feet) together with their foster-mother, and within a few days became
exceedingly tame and unafraid. A few weeks later the bantam was
taken away. The Partridges, although for some time they had
appeared to have little regard for her, or she for them, were much
demoralized by her disappearance, and ran about trying to get out,
stopping every few minutes to give the rally call. After a couple of
days, however, they appeared to have quite forgotten her.
In mid-November three of the five became ill, their faces swelled up
and frothy mucous ran from their eyes and nostrils. This would
appear to have been similar to, and probably homologous with, the
eye-disease described by Hastings (1953). At all events it seemed to
have been due to lack of Vitamin A, and giving the birds halibut oil
speedily cured them. The whole question of feeding I will deal
with later on.
From the fact that three of the birds were noticeably bigger and
heavier than the others, I rightly guessed that they were three cocks
and four hens. I gave away a pair and kept the other five together

in a large aviary, intending to separate them in early spring, when
I expected they would start to form pairs and to quarrel among
themselves.
From February, and increasingly onwards, the Partridges showed
considerable unrest. They ran restlessly up and down the wire,
stopping every few minutes to give the flight-intention call, a throaty
" Tschrech ! Tschrech ! " similar to the alarm call (for ground
predator), often intensifying it to a tern-like " Tschree-ach ! " as they
made the preparatory movements for flying away, and often did in
fact fly up on to some perch or ledge. I saw, indeed, some low
intensity forms of behaviour associated commonly with pairing
display, displacement-feeding, etc., but did not then recognize the
import of such signs. Even by the 8th April, no pairs had
formed, and there had been no fights (wild Red-legs normally pair
in February or the first half of March). With Red-legged Partridge--
as with many other birds--individuals that have been brought up
together do not easily form pairs among themselves. This indecisive
state of affairs continued until about mid-April, when I went away
for four days. During my absence one of those " accidents " such as
so often happen when one leaves one's birds in well-meaning but
incompetent hands occurred. The aviary door was left open, and
all the Partridges (and worse my old cock Jay " P ") escaped, and
were lost, shot in all probability, I fear.
I thought that was the end of my Partridge-keeping, but it was not.
A friend on holiday in Norfolk a month later happened to mention
my loss to a gamekeeper, and the latter very kindly gave him eight
Red-legs' eggs as a gift for me. These were put under a borrowed
bantam hen, and all hatched. Three of the chicks were lost to
predators, but the others throve, including one that was crippled at
an early age owing to a heavy piece of wood falling on it. These
chicks were kept for some time in the moveable pen on the lawn.
Theoretically this should have been better for them, but except
perhaps from a sanitary point of view it was not. At about five weeks
old one or two of the chicks began to get rather wild. This wildness
increased until at about seven weeks all would show some alarm, and
a sudden approach or, more particularly, anything new in my appear-
ance, would set them madly beating at the wire. In desperation
I moved them to a large aviary. It then became evident that their
fears had been aggravated by the lack of cover in the pen on the
open lawn, and the fact of being unable to move to some distance from
the alarming object. At first they ran away whenever I moved in the
aviary, but soon returned to my vicinity. Within three days they
were feeding freely from the hand, and only walking off a short
distance when I moved, and within a week they were extremely
tame, hardly bothering to get out of my way when I walked about.

Giving Rally Call.
In the late autumn I received back the pair of 1950 birds which
I had given away, as their owner was disposing of her game birds.
This pair had always been tame, but were evidently upset by being
caught up and conveyed in a box on the back of a motor-cycle. They
were released together into a large aviary and showed considerable
timidity. Within twenty-four hours the cock had completely retamed,
but his sister remained extremely wild. For several weeks a close
approach would send her crashing madly about. Indeed, in fear of
her injuring herself, I released her, but she returned persistently to
the garden. So I caught her up again and returned her to captivity
after cutting off every other primary and a few secondaries in each
wing. This does not prevent a game bird from flying, but does make
it unlikely to achieve sufficient velocity to injure itself seriously when

it rises in sudden alarm. She gradually became somewhat tamer,
but would never again feed from the hand, and always fled at the
approach of strangers.
After a short time I introduced this pair to the other birds. These
latter received them with the " Who's that ? " " A stranger ! " " Then
chuck a brick at him ! " attitude not uncommon among allegedly
more rational bipeds. The timid hen Partridge, scared of the human
beings present, ran wildly to the far end of the aviary, but her brother
stood his ground. The original inhabitants approached in a stealthy
manner, aggressiveness being obviously tempered by caution. They
went into aggressive display, but the newcomer (hereafter to be
called " P ") was not intimidated, and he displayed back. A fight
soon ensued, the two males pecking at each other's head, and trying
to jump up and beat each other with their legs ; when they failed in
this endeavour--which they usually did--they would seize a billful
of their opponent's neck feathers and tug doggedly. The three females
crowded around displaying, their aggressiveness being evidently not
sufficiently aroused to stimulate them to fight. During a lull in the
battle the lame hen, perhaps overestimating her abilities as we all
so often do, suddenly attacked the strange cock. She soon had cause
to regret her temerity, for he at once counter-attacked. She was
seized, thrown down, and beaten severely, and as soon as she could
tear herself free she fled precipitately into the depths of a rhododendron
bush with all the aggressive drive knocked out of her. Since the two
males " P " and Red--so-called from his ring colour--showed no
signs of ceasing hostilities, and had begun to show signs of exhaustion,
I separated them and shut the former in a small wire pen inside the
aviary, thinking that within a day or two they would have got recon-
ciled to each other's presence. This plan was successful, although
a day's close confinement had an almost too-depressing effect on the
male " P ", who on release showed very mild and timorous behaviour
for some time.
Nothing very interesting happened, or rather was observed, for
some time, except that one night some unknown predator dug in under
the wire and took one of the Partridges, fortunately a hen. At some
trouble and expense wire netting was sunk all round the aviaries to
forestall any repetition of such feats. In late winter, and increasingly
as the days got lighter, the Red-legs showed the same unrest as their
predecessors had done, and likewise gave no signs of pairing. I noticed
that if the male Red started to display, as he often did when
approaching other birds after having been at a distance, " P " would
tend to walk up to him, and sometimes go right up to him and " false-
feed " at his feet. This I suspect was behaviour of an appeasing or
submissive nature, as false-feeding (of which I shall have more to say
later) appears to be essentially a peaceable gesture. I did not then

know the submissive posture, so cannot be sure if " P " showed it
at low intensity on these occasions, but I think it probable that he did.
As by late March no pairing appeared to have taken place, I
decided to try to expedite things. I left Red and one of his sisters--
who was the tamest of all the females--in the original aviary, and
moved " P " and his mate of the previous year (who it will be recalled
was his sister) to another aviary a few yards away, and put the lame
hen in with them. " P," within a few minutes of finding himself
separated from Red, regained all his original self-confidence, and gave
vocal expression to his altered feelings. Red was not slow in answering
his challenges, and for some considerable time thereafter much of
each day was enlivened by the two male Partridges singing against
each other. The song of the Red-legged Partridge, although not
lacking in vigour or persistence, is calculated rather to intimidate
the conspecific rival than to charm the human listener.
After about a week it became quite clear that the male " P " and the
crippled hen had paired. The two birds in the other aviary were,
however, merely carrying on a wholesome platonic friendship, and
had no deeper interest in each other, whilst the timid hen ran un-
ceasingly up and down the wire opposite as if she wished to return to
their aviary. Since it seemed unlikely that Red and his sister would
pair, I put the timid hen in their aviary, and watched events. She
at first fled, terrified at having been handled, but in a few seconds
she came out of cover and made a " dead set " at the male. Within
five minutes they had displayed mutually to each other, copulated,
and prospected a possible nest-site. Her matrimonial ambitions and
status thus having been consolidated the timid hen turned her atten-
tion to her sister-in-law, attacking her with that irresistible, self-
righteous fury that Partridges--like some other bipeds--are apt to
show when they suppose their sexual interests threatened. The victim
showed no resistance, but only extreme fear--in my experience the
usual, though not invariable, reaction of a female Red-leg to actual
physical aggression--fleeing wildly about the aviary, and when
cornered submitting without resistance to the other's attacks. Needless
to say I soon rescued her, feeling a wholly unreasonable aversion for
the timid hen because of her very human-like behaviour in continuing
to ill-treat an unresisting enemy. The rescued bird was placed in
the other aviary. Here the crippled hen, as " lawful wife " of the
male, received her in a similar spirit, but owing to her physical dis-
ability, was unable to translate her feelings into effective action.
After a few days she began to tolerate her rival, and soon they settled
down to a #&amp;lt; menage a trois " with at least no overt signs of hostility.
It seems tolerably certain that such a trio could never form or hold
together in a wild state.
The hen of the pair by themselves soon started to lay. The cock

had already made two nests, one under some brushwood in a corner,
and one under the edge of a rhododendron bush. The first egg was
deposited in the latter, but to my surprise no more appeared in the
next few days. I could see no other nest from a casual inspection,
but when some ten days or so later I made a thorough search, I found
a nest with eight eggs well hidden on the ground in the middle of the
small rhododendron bush. Doubtless the first nest had been deserted
owing to my paying too much attention to it.
When this nest contained nineteen eggs--which were laid at the rate
of about four per week, but I regret I kept no exact count--the cock
scraped out a fresh nest in a far corner under some conifer branches.
The hen then continued laying in this second nest until eighteen eggs
had been deposited in it. I began to fear that the birds did not intend
to sit, but a few mornings after laying her last egg, I found the hen on
the second nest. That day the cock bird showed a remarkable pro-
gressive change in behaviour, becoming hourly more silent and self-
effacing. His air of aggressive masculinity changed in twelve hours to
one of cowed and conscience-stricken femininity. Next day he com-
menced to incubate on the first nest.
That night there was heavy rain, and both Partridges came off
the nest at dawn, and three hours later showed no signs of returning.
I feared they had deserted, but about 11 a.m. both went back on their
respective nests. At first they came off each morning and evening
for some ten to twenty minutes or more, but as incubation progressed
the off-duty spells became shorter, and the evening one dropped out.
For the last four days I saw neither bird off the nest at all, and am
fairly certain they did not come off. I had left them each about a
dozen eggs, but some did not hatch, and were found on examination
to have small " hair-cracks " in them. Possibly the Lanceolated
Jays in the same aviary had pecked inquisitively at them, though
they had not actually broken any. When the first of the twenty chicks
that did hatch poked its head from under the mother, the lame hen
Jay at once hopped up, seized and flew away with it. The Partridge
did not seem to grasp the significance of this incident, and showed
no signs of resentment. I was in a quandary since the Jays were then
(mid July) in full moult, and the last thing I wished to do was to
handle them. With acumen rare to me, I thought of the solution,
cut a large hole in the side of the aviary and another in that of one
near by, connected the two with a wire funnel, and easily drove the
Jays into exile.
When the young Partridges were led from the nest it became
abundantly clear that their parents had no interest in each other, but
were solely concerned with the young. They did not quarrel, but
the male would give his note of protest if the female came near when
he was brooding. Owing to the chicks not distinguishing father

from mother, the broods were often unequally divided, and one saw
the ludicrous spectacle of one parent uncomfortably brooding sixteen
or seventeen, whilst the other had only one or two chicks beneath it.
Adult Brooding Month-old Chicks.
As with other game birds, the parent Red-leg reacts violently
to the sound of a chick in distress or to the sight of some innately
recognized enemy, but it is a case of " out of sound, out of mind
So long as there are no overt reminders of the rest of the family, it is
quite " happy " with even a single chick. Stupid though this behaviour
may seem to the minds of animals capable of conceiving the Atomic
Bomb and the Inquisition, it is, nevertheless, obviously adaptive.
When irrevocable disaster has overtaken the majority of the brood it
is clearly of great biological advantage that the parent should be able
to concern itself wholeheartedly with the welfare of the survivors,
instead of vainly fretting over the dead which no power on earth can
bring to life again.
After the first week the chicks' mobility increased ; they were
constantly roaming the whole aviary, and had learnt that my appear-
ance meant food. Their timid mother usually ran to the far end of
the aviary, especially if any stranger appeared, and tried to call the
chicks away. They, however, soon learned to ignore her under these
circumstances, and would come running up to me with their father,
who was perfectly tame.
More surprising than the chicks failing to be influenced by their
mother's wildness was her lack of response to their tameness. Two
of the chicks died when three weeks old, but the remaining seventeen
were reared. Despite the fact that she was now in company of eighteen
other Red-legs, all of whom were extremely tame, the old hen still
remained wild. It is often thought that birds are greatly influenced
by the behaviour of their companions, but in my experience this is
usually only so if they have no " preconceived ideas " on the object
evoking their companion's behaviour. A bird that is afraid of a person

seldom shows any less fear because a fellow-captive greets his appear-
ance with eagerness. Nor, on the other hand, does a tame bird often
become wild if associated with a timid comrade.
When moulted out into their adult plumage the seventeen young
Partridges made a delightful picture. They were very tame, and
some of them would even perch on my arms and shoulders to be fed.
The food bill was, however, considerable, and I had not sufficient
space, so I reluctantly decided to part with the majority. I thought
that the best chance of their getting to good homes was to give them
away. In this I may have been wrong, as many people value more
something they have paid a high price for than something that has
cost little or nothing. Accordingly, I put a note to the effect that
I had some Red-legs to spare in our Magazine. The result was over-
whelming, and I was not able to reply to all the letters I received,
though I read them all more than once. Finally, the spare birds were
all sent off to their new homes with sundry members of the Avicultural
Society. One of the latter neither acknowledged receipt of the birds
nor--in spite of repeated requests--did he ever return my travelling-
cage to me. The four other members sent me nice letters of thanks,
and promised to let me know how the birds fared. None of them
did so and when, a year later, I made inquiries I learned that in two
cases the birds had been killed by stoats or foxes. The other two did
not bother to reply at all to my letters, so I rather fear their Partridges
had also come to grief by some accident, or else been sold or eaten !
The " trio " of Red-legs in the other aviary laid three nests of eggs.
Both hens laid in the same nest. The impulse to lay in a nest already
containing an egg or eggs, rather than an empty one, is very strong
in game birds, and has of course long been utilized by keepers of
domestic fowls to induce their birds to lay in nest-boxes where the eggs
can be gathered. In a wild state this impulse is biologically useful,
since it ensures that the bird will lay her later eggs in the same place
as the first and not in one of the innumerable other sites that are
in other respects " just as good ". Like many other innate impulses--
and not only those of the class Aves, this one can prove harmful where
man has altered the natural state of things. If the gravid female game
bird finds a nest already containing eggs, she will lay in it rather than
make one for herself elsewhere. This happens very rarely where wild
game birds are at a normal density, but often in areas where game-
preservation holds sway. Everyone knows how common an occurrence
are nests containing the eggs of two or more females--often of different
species--in English game preserves. In the case of the captive Red-legs
the fact that the male usually takes the initiative in selecting the nest
site also probably affected the issue, since the male scratches out
another nest, to which he calls the female when the first is full
of eggs.

In this aviary only one female (the sound one) incubated, on the
last of the three nests. Unfortunately, she became ill and died quite
suddenly after sitting for twelve days. Neither the male nor the
crippled female went broody. I thought at the time the male's failure
to do so was because the female was still with him, but later observa-
tions changed my opinion. I now suspect that his failure to incubate
(which he has shown also in 1953) is due to the fact that incubation
in the male is accompanied by a psychological change to a furtive and
non-aggressive mood. This would presumably be more " difficult "
for an individual whose aggressive drive is extremely strong, as is the
case with this male. Of course it is probable that some factors of
captive life may also tend to inhibit incubation.
Having given away my surplus Partridges, I still retained six birds,
thinking this an ample number for future study in view of my restricted
time, space, and money. Unfortunately various disasters happened,
culminating in an infestation of gapes that wiped out in 1953 all the
remaining birds, except the two old males and two juveniles, one of
which latter subsequently escaped and was lost. I am now left with
three males, and all efforts to purchase some tame females have proved
unavailing.
Some notes on the care of these birds may prove of interest.
Food.
I have found that Red-legs do well on a diet of grain (wheat and/or
millet), with a little bread and milk (to which bemax and glucodin
are added) about twice a week. This can be varied with dry whole-
meal bread, and a few peanuts or small bits of cheese given by hand
frequently, will help to keep the birds tame. Plenty of fresh green food
is important. No matter how well fed otherwise Partridges like to eat
quantities of green food. Cabbages and lettuces, especially such as
have run to seed, brussels sprouts, etc., are all acceptable, but par-
ticularly fresh turves of grass and clover. From a turf they can pluck
the grass-blades, clover leaves, seeding weed-heads, and so forth, in a
natural manner, but such things as lettuces must be firmly tied or
fixed between two bricks so the birds can peck at them. When breeding
the hens especially often relish beetles, mealworms, and other insects,
though in general they care little for them once adult. Probably if
the diet were otherwise poor in protein they would eat them at all
times. In the domestic fowl and Golden Pheasant the inclination to
eat earthworms--which is usually only shown by growing young and
laying females--can be stimulated by putting them on a low-protein
diet. If the floor of the aviary is covered in parts to a depth of several
inches with leaf-mould or similar litter, and millet thrown into this, the
birds will take a lot of exercise scratching for the seed.
I expect any regime on which young pheasants are successfully

reared would suit young Red-legs. If mine are being reared by a
bantam, I place them on the lawn in a pen, which is moved daily.
If they can be obtained, I feed largely on the cocoons and grubs of the
small ants (one reddish and one black) whose earth-heap nests are
common in fields and roadside grass strips. The chicks also eat the
winged male and queen ants, and sometimes--with less avidity--the
workers also. In addition to this I give milk-sop to which a little
bemax and glucodin has been added, a few mealworms or mealworm
pupae, and any other small insects that come to hand. After a week
or two I add a little seed to the diet, and gradually get them on to the
same diet as the adults. Growing young may be given the cocoons of
the large wood-ant, but I do not like these for baby chicks as the
fiercely fighting worker ants might do them some harm in the early
stages.
At first the chicks are ravenously fond of mealworms, but in every
brood I have reared they have " lost the taste " for them between
four and six weeks of age, although still continuing to eat ant cocoons,
cheese, broken peanuts, and other rich but non-motile food. When the
Partridge chicks are reared by their own parents the same regime will
suffice. So long as they are getting plenty of ant pupae and green food,
they take no harm from eating a certain amount of grain from an
early age. Grit, clean water, and dust-bathing facilities must, of
course, be provided for both young and old.
Diseases.
My first brood of Red-legs developed swollen faces, with running
eyes and noses, in late November. This would appear to have been a
form of Xerothalmia, or something akin to it (Hastings, 1953). The
birds were quickly cured by giving each a few peanuts slightly coated
with halibut liver oil daily until they improved. Since then I have
given my Partridges a feed of grain treated with halibut oil, about
once a week from October to May and have had no further trouble.
Gape-worm infestation, as I have narrated, wiped out most of my
Partridges in 1953. The adding of T.C.P., permanganate of potash,
and so forth to the drinking water has, in my experience, proved
futile. Mechanical removal of gapeworms although often successful
with Jays, proved no use with the Partridges. I have since found
Barintar--a powder manufactured and sold by I.C.I.--effective in
curing afflicted Jays, and hope that it will prove equally so for
Partridges if mine are so unlucky as to be again attacked with this
scourge. I may say that I found Aniodol Interne had no apparent
adverse effect on gapeworms in Jays and Partridges. This is strange
when so many members appear to have found it a certain cure for
gapeworms in Starlings. Gapeworms are said to be often picked up
through eating insects or worms that contain their eggs. This seems

likely to have been the case with my Partridges where the two laying
females, and most of the young were infected, but not the two non-
insectivorous adult males. Where young Partridges are reared by
their own parents in aviaries, where the ground and its insect life are
likely to be infected with gape-worm eggs, it is probable that the
method suggested by Wilford Smith (1947) would prove a remedy.
This consisted of thickly covering the floor of the aviary with dead
bracken, so that the chicks did not come into contact with the earth.
Pros and Cons.
As aviary birds Red-legs can be recommended for their beauty,
tameness (in most cases), and the ease with which they can be kept
and bred. They are not, however, suitable for small aviaries. On the
regime often accorded to gallinaceous birds in public aviaries (whose
proprietors are sometimes, I suspect, in league with anti-bird-keeping
circles) of corn ad lib and a lump of stale cabbage once a week, they
most certainly will soon cease to be of any beauty or interest.
Their faults are those common to most largish ground birds. They
foul the ground considerably (removing the droppings from and/or
liming the roosting places will help to obviate this), and may cause
considerable disturbance if they panic at night. Although not usually
aggressive to weaker birds, they may be so at times, birds with young,
and males in breeding condition whose aggressive drive is very strong,
being the most likely offenders in this respect.
Voice and Display.
I shall only briefly mention these, as I have dealt rather fully
with them in a recent paper (Goodwin, 1953) elsewhere, to which
readers are referred. Einbeck (1834) also mentions this subject, and
gives many interesting details about his captive specimens.
The most familiar note is the " rally call "--the loud, rather harsh
" Chuk, chuk, chukuk, chukar ! " This is used to indicate the bird's
whereabouts to its young, mate, or companions when, for any reason,
it has become separated from them. In spring the male utters a loud
harsh rhythmical " song " which suggests a laboured steam-engine.
At a little distance it is hard to believe that a bird, and not a loco-
motive, is responsible. These two calls are loud and far carrying, but
the bird also utters a great many other notes, most of which are rather
quiet, and hence not often known to sportsmen and others who are
only familiar with the species at gun-shot range or further.
The commonest display is one in which the bird draws back its
uplifted head at the same time " twisting round " the face and neck
markings in a peculiar manner, so that they are displayed almost fully
to one side. The barred flank feathers come up high over the wing
on the " displa/ing side ". The other wing is often drooped, so that

the primaries drag the ground. This display is primarily threatening,
but it is shown between male and female--interspersed with food-
calling and other appeasing gestures--during pair-formation. When
feeling " inferior " and wishing to avoid fighting, a bird usually
responds to any signs of aggressiveness by walking in a somewhat
crouching " guilty-looking 55 posture. At a highter intensity of this
feeling it will raise one or both wings above the line of the back, and
at the same time spread out the primaries. In this movement the
yellow-buff on the outer ends of the primaries and some of the
secondaries become much more conspicuous than when the wing is
folded normally.

By A. A. Clarence (Nunton, Nr. Salisbury, Wilts, England)
I have long been impressed by the loneliness of single birds and the
friendships that ensue. Also by the cruelty of birds to their kind.
Among them the Orange-headed Ground Thrush is a good example.
He seems to reserve his spleen for the hens of his own race. For the
last three years I have had a pair of these birds in a 40-foot aviary.
On Christmas Day the cock slew his hen with evident pleasure, and left
her corpse without feather on head, neck, and back.
I arrived on the scene just after he had committed the murder,
and found him perched above preening his feathers, and obviously
saying "well, good-bye to all that". Possibly the reason for his action
was that for two seasons he had carefully built perfect nests which had
been ignored by the hen. Last spring he built two, one of them in
a circular tin about 8 inches in diameter and 2 inches high. This tin
was used for seed and is fixed to the top of a 4-foot drainpipe with a
hood over it against rain.
After some weeks of waiting, a Brown-eared Bulbul decided that
it was her's for the taking and took possession. She laid three eggs of
a beautiful mottled strawberry tint, which were inspected daily by the
Orange-head. He would stand on the edge of the tin, and look at the

little hen with his head cocked on one side with an expression of
astonishment which clearly indicated " well I'm hanged ! ". She
would look back at him and chatter in a most friendly way.
After nearly three weeks she gave up trying to hatch infertile eggs,
to my disappointment and that of her spouse. A Red-vented Bulbul
immediately took over the nest and added one solitary egg to the
clutch. The Orange-head took no interest whatever in her or her
doings, even when, in due course, the chick was hatched.
For no particular reason this baby was called " Georgie " and now
George or Georgina whichever sex it is, is flying strong and full grown
with its parents, and three other brothers and sisters of the previous
year's hatch. The year before that the old pair had two young ones,
both of which they killed, as soon as they were full grown, which all
goes to show how sweet they are.
With regard to curious friendships, a pair of Canary-winged Parrakeets
also inhabit this aviary. In the spring I introduced a Golden-crowned
Conure cock. Immediately the hen Canary-wing left her husband,
and became the inseparable companion of the Conure, who likewise
is devoted to her. The Canary-wing is very tame and flies to my
shoulder as soon as I enter the aviary. The Conure eventually over-
came his fear and now sits on the other shoulder, but is off at the
smallest sign of intimacy on my part. I have to keep an eye on him,
as he would like to bite my ear hard, and has done so once or twice.
No doubt he thinks he is getting his own back for past grievances.
Unexpected things happen in aviculture, as we all know. The most
interesting in my experience happened last summer and concerned a
pair of Cockatiels. These birds had a second nest. The eggs were about
to hatch when the hen became ill and died. In the aviary with the
parents were four young Cockatiels from the first nest, which they had
left about six weeks before.
I was lamenting the loss of the hen, and had just removed her warm
corpse from the corner into which she had fallen, when to my astonish-
ment one of her daughters, showing concern, flew to the nest and
inspected the contents. She did this several times and within half
an hour was in the box sitting on the four eggs, all of which she
hatched in the next few days and brought up successfully.
Although I watched carefully, I could never decide if any of the
other children helped to feed their younger brothers and sisters.
I think not, judging by their bibs, which were always clean whereas
the little foster-mother became wet-bibbed and bedraggled.

By Frances E. Matthews (Cranleigh, Surrey, England)
I have been asked to give a few particulars about my foreign birds.
Some years ago they were housed in aviaries, and then there was much
more of interest to tell about them. Owing to the changeable seasons,
the birds now in great request are the species which can stand up to
all rapid changes of temperature. The birds I have now are all
indoors in a large room. This gets all the sun and the windows can
open without draught.
I have Violet-ears, Red-headed Gouldians, Cordon Bleus, and Zebra
Finches--all in large cages.
The pair of Violet-ears have been very busy making their nest.
They are very tame. The nest is made from plaited rushes. It is
cone-like in shape and now it is filled with grass. I find these birds
very attractive. They never quarrel ! Both birds can sing before it is
daylight ! The cock's note is like that of the Reed Warbler. The hen
in her nest joins in " to cheer him up 55 !
Presently the cock calls her out for their morning drill. This consists
of a very graceful type of flying--in which each bird takes part--each
bird rising and bending as they fly across the cage. But they time it
so that they never touch. I think this exercise is unique and interesting.
The Gouldians, two pairs, are not as energetic as the Violet-ears.
One pair inhabits an indoor aviary, on the lines of the one illustrated
in Mr. D. H. Risdon's book, which I think is very good. The birds
enjoy ample space and sunshine. They have a good box nest which
they are preparing. In the same enclosure are a small pair of Gordon
Bleus in a rush nest at the other end. The four birds get on well,
though the Cordons are not allowed to know which nest they may be
allowed to occupy !
Last year, in another place, the Gordon hen laid two eggs but they
were not hatched as the birds were disturbed. The second pair of
Gouldians, though they have filled their large nest-box with grass, don't
seem anxious to nest. Two pairs of Zebra Finches, in separate cages,
spend their time talking and making a lot of noise, filling their nest
with grass and removing it. It delights them to make a noise. They
can do this when they make a root of grass really hard and then drop
it. If the hen lays eggs she disregards them. The cock thinks otherwise.
Now I must tell you about Julie, our African Grey Parrot. She lives
by herself, and is very strong and not afraid of cold. Her voice can be
heard very early, when she hears my daughter moving about. Polly
lets her know she is alive. She is told she is " making too much noise
and must wait Her loneliness must find expression, however, and
her want to be uncovered is attended to. The seed first, then the bread

and butter, with marmalade, arrive and Julie's remark is " Whoo ! ".
She knows my step and connects it with one or two grapes.
My daughter speaks to me in my room (Polly's hearing is very
good) so she joins in the conversation, and says " Yes mother " !
She does not talk when she comes to my room and climbs up on my
knee to be stroked, but it is difficult to persuade her to go back to her
cage. I think one of her best remarks was when told that " The
gardener might be late coming to clean her cage Julie said,
" What a shame ! ".

By the death, at the ripe age of 93, of George Edward Lodge, the
world has lost one of the greatest bird artists of all times, for his
paintings of birds and of their natural surroundings were not excelled
by any.
Lodge was perhaps primarily interested in the birds of prey, of
which he was an authority, and his pictures of these are amongst his
best known. He had, in his younger days, done a great deal of falconry
and the falcons were his great favourites, though the game birds
ran them closely. He dearly loved the Highlands, and his pictures of
grouse and ptarmigan, with perhaps a falcon attacking them, are
amongst his finest works. When he took a holiday it was generally
to visit his Scottish friends who were always glad to have him in their
shooting or stalking parties, for he was an excellent shot. But his
travels were not confined to the British Isles ; he had visited the
United States, West Indies and Scandinavia in his studies of birds
and beasts.
As well as being an artist, Lodge was a very keen naturalist, and it
was always a delight to talk with him on birds and other British
creatures, for he knew them all and had studied their minutest habits.
I have known him well for the past half century, our first meetings
being at the Ornithologists' Club, when those early meetings were
held in Frascati's Restaurant in Oxford Street. I have talked with
him and admired his work in his studio in South Kensington, where
a lot of his pictures were made, and later when he had retired to
Camberley. Well do I remember (it must be close on fifty years ago)
when the Zoo had acquired a fine Lesser Bird of Paradise which was
housed in the old Insect House on the north bank of the canal. Few
had, up to that time, seen the full display of this species, but we heard
that this bird was beginning to show off in the early mornings. Ogilvie-
Grant, of the British Museum, was anxious that Lodge should make
sketches of the display, so Grant, Lodge, and myself arranged to meet

there at eight o'clock on a given morning. It was a bright morning,
perhaps too bright for the bird's liking, for he refused to display,
though Lodge was able to obtain sketches of various attitudes.
Lodge's pictures have been reproduced in most of the best ornitho-
logical books of the last half century or more, and they are particularly
pleasing as being both excellent drawings of the birds themselves
and beautiful pictures of their surroundings, whether woodlands,
lakes, or mountains. His latest work, only completed shortly before
his death, has been the illustration of David Bannerman's Birds of the
British Isles , a colossal undertaking for which he painted no less
than 435 species comprised in 377 plates. These depict not only the
well-known species, but the occasional immigrants that have obtained
a place on the British List. He only wrote one book himself, Memoirs
of an Artist Naturalist , an excellent book containing a number of his
pictures, both in colour and monochrome, though the reproduction
in some cases is not quite up to the mark.
When I saw him last in his house in Camberley he had grown a
beard which well suited his handsome face. He had practically lost
the sight of one eye, but could still paint as well as ever, though he
told me that it took him much longer than formerly, and to put in
a bird's eye which formerly took but a few minutes, now took the
best part of half an hour.
His house was quite a museum as well as a gallery of pictures,
wings, tails, and skeletons of birds to show the arrangement of the
feathers, the joints, and so on, for as he said, the bird artist has to
know precisely how every feather lies and the exact position of every
joint. He was also a skilled taxidermist.
George Lodge was a younger son of Canon Samuel Lodge, Rector
of Scrivelsby, in Lincolnshire, and cousin of the late Sir Oliver Lodge.
He never married, his sister keeping house for him until a few years
ago, when she died. Archibald Thorburn, that other great bird
artist, who died several years ago, was one of Lodge's great friends.
Now both are gone, the last of the Old School of Bird Painters. Will
the younger generation produce any quite so good ?

By J. M. Spence (Cape Town, S. Africa)
On gth February I was given a Cape Robin (Caffrornis caffira caffra).
I have had them many times before, but had never succeeded in
keeping them very long as we are unable to get prepared food for
softbills, and no one could tell me much about them. To cut a long
story short I tried him on egg and biscuit (one mashed egg to two
biscuits) ; it worked and he thrived on it and gradually I enlarged his
diet (boiled potato, fish meal, bread and milk, grated carrot and
cheese). The general colour of the bird is dark grey with a rusty-
coloured breast and tail and it has a white eye-strip. The most
attractive thing about these birds is that they are forever flicking their
tails, to show the two dark feathers in the middle. They are mainly
terrestrial in habits although they spend much of their time in low
bushes searching for insects.
On 21 st February I turned my bird into one of my aviaries, 18 feet
by 11 feet by 8 feet high, containing about sixty other birds of various
kinds, including some Sunbirds.
I obtained a hen on 22 nd February. She was meated-off in the
birdroom for a week and then turned into the aviary with the cock.
This pair got along quite agreeably as long as the hen kept a respectful
distance, but at times he would chase her round quite unmercifully.
I have, incidentally, had cocks which would tolerate neither cocks nor
hens and if the bird was not removed in time a particularly horrible
death was liable to follow.
I got another pair on 12 th April and turned them into a smaller
aviary, 1 o feet by 6 feet by 8 feet high. This pair as it happened got on
very well together. They were housed with a pair of Cape Bulbuls and
three Bokmakieries (Telophorus zeylonus zeylonus ). There was no trouble
and all went well until the 22 nd April when one of the hens died
quite suddenly, but I was given another on 19th May.
As the summer got closer the cocks started to show signs of wanting
to mate, and on 13th August the cock in the big aviary suddenly
grabbed the hen and before anything could be done she was dead
with a broken neck.
On 29th September the cock in the smaller aviary was noticed to
be having trouble with his eyes. He was caught up and treated with
bicarbonate of soda solution and Vaseline E.T.C., but of no avail ;
he died on 5th October.
I then introduced the remaining cock to the hen and on 26th October
I suspected them to be nesting, as I could only see one of them at a
time, so they were left severely alone.
After a few days I noticed that the bread and milk was disappearing

faster than usual. They had the same diet previously described, and no
live food whatsoever because I was afraid a sudden change of diet
might affect them adversely.
On Thursday, 12th November, I saw a youngster running amongst
the long grass in the aviary, and on the 13th I found it dead near the
door.
Then on Sunday the 15th when I opened the door to feed the birds
there on a perch straight in front of me was a second youngster, this
time very far advanced, in fact so much so that before I knew what had
happened it flew past me into the garden. I managed to catch it again
and it was returned to its aviary within an hour. On the Monday
evening I had to remove the cock because he was constantly chasing
the youngster round and round the aviary.
The youngster was somewhat smaller than its parents, and the body
was grey-brown, streaked with black. The tail was the exact copy of
its parents except that it was shorter.
On 27th November the hen had sore eyes, so I put her into the
birdroom and tried to cure her eyes but of no avail; she died on 13th
December. Incidentally, this eye disease is a queer thing, the lids of the
eye go hard with some secretion from the eyeball. It looks very much
like pus from a festered sore, so that when the eye is closed the bird is
unable to open it and also when opened it is unable to close it. When,
and if, you are able to stop the secretion of the fluid by constantly
washing with bicarbonate of soda and boracic solution then the
feathers round the eyes and beak start to come away, until finally the
eyes start watering again and the bird just wastes away. I have been
unable to cure this disease and would be glad to hear if any fellow
members have come across the same thing, or could recommend some
cure, or better still some preventive. At the time of writing I am
battling to save the two remaining Robins from the same horrible and
slow death. I have managed to stop the eyes secreting the liquid by
using a powerful solution of boracic acid powder.
I am sorry that I am unable to give more detail as to the colour,
size, and shape of the eggs, period of incubation, growth and feeding
of the offspring but as I say I was loth to interfere with their nesting
activities in any way in case they deserted the nest.
The only thing I was able to get any information on was the nest :
it was (internal measurements) three inches in diameter and one and
a half to two inches deep, and constructed of rootlets, coir, feathers,
and hair in the form of a cup. The nest was well placed as far as
protection from the weather was concerned because it was placed
under a tuft of long grass which in turn was under a Pittosporum tree
about four feet high.
As far as I can deduce from studying their nesting habits in the wild

the incubation period is from twelve to fourteen days, and the young-

MR. RUDKIN, Sr., CARRIES ON AT 92 !
By Carl Naether (Sherman Oaks, Calif., U.S.A.)
One of California's ablest and most successful aviculturists, Francis
H. Rudkin, Sr., is to-day making active plans for the 1954 breeding
season. Though 92 years old, this indefatigable birdlover is remodelling
some of his aviaries at his cosy citrus ranch in Fillmore, California,
for more convenient and effective birdkeeping.
Almost ever since the vear 1912, when the Rudkin family forsook
their homeland, England, to build a new home and a new life among
strange surroundings and people in California, birds of various kinds
have been in the minds and hearts of both Mr. and Mrs. Rudkin, Sr.
Their special attention for years has been devoted to the breeding
of parrot-like birds, in which phase of aviculture they have been
eminently successful.
Since the passing of his wife, Mr. Rudkin, Sr. has carried on his
great hobby with double devotion. Perhaps the most fruitful results
of his labours in the field of aviculture are not the raising of many
and often rare parrot-like birds in the numerous aviaries he keeps
going year in and year out, but the encouragement, the inspiration,
and the helpful advice he has been giving all these many years to
the visitors who almost daily throng his home-place to view his birds
and to catch some of this great man's enthusiasm for his feathered
friends. Unquestionably, Francis H. Rudkin, Sr., has the satisfaction
of having been responsible for starting many men and women on the
long road to successful birdkeeping. Always genial, always eager to
help solve a bird problem, he has given unstintingly of his time and
effort every day in the year, including Sunday, to furthering the
most constructive and wholesome interests of aviculture. Not only
grown-ups have thus benefited from association with this eminent
bird fancier, but youngsters of all ages, brought by their elders or
teachers in small and large groups to view the Rudkin bird collection,
have been thrilled by the colourful display of so many and so varied
species of parrots, cockatoos, cockatiels, parrakeets, lovebirds, and
other showy feathered creatures. And all of them, youngsters as well
as grown-ups, have taken away with them not only the memory of
beautiful birds, happy in their spacious surroundings, but of a man's
loyal devotion to their everyday welfare and their happiness. Though
Francis H. Rudkin, Sr., keeps hundreds of birds, as he takes his visitors

from aviary to aviary, he spiritedly relates stories of what this bird
or that bird has done, or has not done, thus keeping his visitors on the
alert during every joyous moment of their visit. If he had made
written note of the innumerable questions he has been asked about
the care and breeding of parrotlike birds--and has valiantly
endeavoured to answer fully and satisfactorily--they would indeed fill
a very sizeable volume.
This modest tribute to a great and venerable aviculturist is written
in the hope that it will in some measure inspire other birdlovers to
follow his fine example. It is one thing to keep birds for one's very
own pleasure and self-satisfaction ; it is quite another thing to ride
one's hobby successfully and at the same time share its successes and
its joys with like-minded men and women, not only in one's immediate
neighbourhood, not only in one's state or even country, but even
abroad--as Mr. Rudkin has demonstrated for so many years to so
many people.
In closing, I am confident that the members of the Avicultural

By Roland W. Hawkins (Pittsburgh, Penn., U.S.A.)
Down through the ages mankind has derived endless hours of
pleasure from keeping birds as pets. Some species are valued for their
songs or ability to mimic the human voice, and others for their
beautiful plumage. To-day there are many bird fanciers whose entire
enthusiasm and interest in birds is directed towards breeding certain
species to obtain purer strains and specific colour patterns. The
methods of keeping birds has unfortunately shown little imagination
and the conventional types of cages constructed of wood or metal
having either screen, wire, or glass sides does little to promote the
happiness of its inmates. Of all the animal kingdom, birds, due to their
powers of flight, are perhaps the most freedom-loving creatures on the
face of the earth. To capture and confine them within the cages as we
know them to-day produces results that are all too apparent in the
birds' condition. Certain species that have been domesticated by man,
such as the canary, thrive and appear perfectly happy within the
confines of a small cage. A great many of the larger public and private
aviaries where collections of local and foreign birds are housed, consist
of row after row of cages containing nothing more than perches, food,

and water vessels. Regardless of how well the birds are cared for, they
cannot reflect happiness in such an environment, for it is nothing more
than a jail bearing with it a sentence for life-time solitary confinement.
In recent years there has been a decided trend towards larger flight
cages containing running water and some plant life. This is a highly
commendable improvement as the birds have more area to exercise
and do not feel so badly shut in.
In keeping with the progressive march of the City of Pittsburgh is
the new Conservatory-Aviary located in West Park on the city's North
Side. Here is a success story of a building unique in design and
principle, where the method of exhibiting birds in captivity has entered
upon a new era that makes the old-fashioned cage methods seem
completely antiquated.
In two large glass-domed conservatory rooms constructed of steel
and aluminium, tropical birds and plants thrive in complete harmony.
Without the intervention of physical barriers of screen, wire, or glass,
visitors are permitted to walk in the rooms with the birds and plants,
to see and study them in a natural environment. The many species of
lush tropical plants, including bamboo, rubber trees, avocado, papaya,
coffee, mango, and various palms, etc., along with a myriad of interest-
ing smaller plants sets the stage for the many species of tropical birds
selected for their beauty, character, and song. A running stream,
complete with cascading waterfalls and pools, adds natural beauty as
well as providing a home for numerous species of fish, aquatic fresh-
water animals and water plants. It does not require an experienced
eye to see that the birds are completely happy in this environment,
a condition easy to judge through their actions and appearance.
Sleek in their full plumage they are active bright-eyed birds reflecting
their boundless energy and health with their songs and calls, echoing
and re-echoing throughout the rooms. Where the species are repre-
sented by both male and female birds, breeding and nesting activities
have been carried out successfully within the rooms. When birds
mate, build nests, and rear young it seems right to assume they are not
feeling remorseful at being held in confinement.
The overwhelming success of this new combination Conservatory-
Aviary will undoubtedly stimulate interest in vivariums throughout
the world. Now it has been conclusively proved that birds, plants,
flowers, and fish will all thrive and propagate themselves under the
same glass roof, aviaries and conservatories can unite and present
a continuous cultural showplace of far-reaching educational values to
young and old alike.
There were a few sceptical critics who believed a venture of this type
would be doomed to failure from the beginning, their reasoning being
that the birds would destroy the plant life and mess up the exhibit
areas to such an extent it would become unsightly. The rule of success

governing this problem was through the control of population, both
as to numbers and to species. Birds known for their destructive ten-
dencies towards succulent plants were either omitted from the rooms
entirely, or represented by a few individuals. By controlling the
population in this way, plant destruction is of no significance. Once
established the plant life grows so profusely it has to be cut back from
time to time, otherwise it would completely take over the rooms.
Insect pests pose a more serious problem as poisonous insecticides
cannot be used, being fatally disastrous to the birds. The insectivorous
birds keep the plants clean of mealy bugs and aphid, but the scale
insects have to be controlled manually. The foliage is kept clean by
the morning and afternoon syringing of the plants and any bird
droppings that may have spotted the leaves washes off readily.
With no need for far-reaching vision it is now possible to predict
the progress of new aviaries in the future. Large conservatory-type
structures will be built and planned along ecological lines by scientists
representing all the fields of our natural sciences. Together they will be
able to plan authentic ecological controlled rooms, of the various life
zones, complete with the dominant plants and birds endemic of the
different areas chosen. These displays will undoubtedly take the place
of existing bird and plant exhibits as we know them in our zoological
gardens, aviaries, and museums of to-day. In such buildings, where
birds and plants can be kept under continuous surveillance, ecological
studies of their inter-relationship will advance rapidly. The educational
and scientific prospects for such buildings will have tremendous
influence on the studies of natural history in the future.
Few people have an opportunity during their lifetime to visit
tropical countries, where in their leisure hours, they can make trips into
remote areas to observe and study the flora and fauna. With such
buildings as the Conservatory-Aviary within the limits of our modern
cities, many of the most interesting exotic birds and plants can be
studied in comparative comfort, without being subjected to the rigours
of tropical exploration. Jungle entanglements, biting insects, poisonous
snakes, are far away when one enjoys the thrill of watching a flame-
coloured " Cock of the Rock 53 fly from tree to tree in the new Con-
servatory-Aviary. Toucans with their large colourful bills, the piercing
calls of the Naked-throated Bell Birds, the pendulum tail movements
of the Motmot, the cordial greeting of the Javan Hill Mynah are
but a few of the many interesting and colourful tropical birds you will
encounter. Many visitors are thrilled to see how bananas grow while
others are amazed at the phenomenal growth rate of the bamboo shoots,
growing twelve inches a day. Flora and fauna, the combination of
the two makes an impressive exhibition.
Although many of us have dreamed of such a place the credit for
seeing these dreams realized belongs to Mr. Howard B. Stewart,

In response to numerous requests it has been decided to launch an
appeal for funds for a Memorial to the late Duke of Bedford. The
memorial will take the form of an aviary to be erected in the Zoological
Gardens at Regent's Park, London, where the Zoological Society
will maintain a collection of homing Budgerigars at semi-liberty. In
addition, it is proposed to provide a Challenge Cup to be known as
the " Duke of Bedford Memorial Trophy " for the best Parrot-like
bird, to be competed for annually at the National Cage Bird Exhibi-
tion. The appeal committee consists of Mr. Alfred Ezra, President of
the Avicultural Society, Miss E. Maud Knobel, Messrs. E. J. Boosey,
B. H. Dulanty, S. Porter, A. A. Prestwich, D. Seth-Smith, J. J. Yealland,
and R. C. J. Sawyer (Hon. Treasurer).
The Council of the Avicultural Society have decided to give the
appeal every support, and it is hoped members of the Society will send
donations, however small, to the fund for a Memorial to this great
aviculturist, to whom aviculture in general and the Society in
particular, owe so much.
Cheques, postal orders, etc., should be sent to :--

" The Technique of Bird Ringing ", " Trapping Birds and Rings ",
and " Records and Field Equipment ". It is written in an interesting
and readable style, but it is unfortunate that the authors have not
been more careful in checking their dates and other precise informa-
tion. On page 6, for instance, the establishment of the Royal
Hungarian Central Bureau for Ornithology is given as 1903, whereas
this should have been 1908, and the date of the establishment of the
Heligoland station as 1904 instead of 1909. Further, on the same
page, reference is made to work done in Spain which is no doubt a
mistake for work done in Portugal, and a distinguished Civil Servant
is designated " Professor ", a title he has never possessed.
Moreover, it is rather surprising that though the authors acknow-
ledge the " bibliographical assistance " given by Dr. W. Rydzewski,
no acknowledgment is made to the extracts which have been taken
from that author's paper " A historical review of bird marking "
(.Dansk Ornithologisk Foreninings Tidsskrift, May, 1951), which are
given in the first chapter.

Page 32, line 27. For " Green-winged Malkoha " read " Green-billed Malkoha
The St. Thomas Conure
During the time the parrot ban was suspended many Conures with orange-yellow
cheeks and orange circles round the eyes were imported. For reasons best-known
to themselves the " trade " sold them as St. Thomas's Conures. Strangely, none
appears to have questioned this name, although even a moment's thought would
have made it obvious that this was very probably a misnomer--it being most unlikely
that so many Conures could have come from an island the small size (32 square miles)
of St. Thomas, one of the Virgin Islands.
While in England during the summer, Dr. Lendon saw specimens at the London
Zoo, " Darenth-Hulme ," and elsewhere, and immediately expressed his disagreement
with the identification. The Doctor gave it as his opinion that this co-called " St.
Thomas's " was really the Yellow-cheeked Conure, Aratinga pertinax chrysophrys , of
British Guiana, Surinam, and Cayenne : this identification has since been confirmed
by reference to the skins at the British Museum (Natural History).
Dr. Lendon informs me that when on a recent visit to the Brookfield Zoo, Chicago,
he saw a real St. Thomas Conure (A. p. pertinax ). According to Karl Plath this bird,
the survivor of four, is considered really rare.
Other vernacular names for A. p. chrysophrys are Golden-eyebrowed and Guiana

SUSCEPTIBILITY OF MOUSTACHE PARRAKEETS TO PNEUMONIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9857445625" page_id="56238213"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Further experience with the Moustache Parrakeet tends to confirm their
susceptibility to pneumonia as discussed by Mr. Buckingham-Jones.
My birds were kept in unheated outdoor flights all the year round and appeared to
be perfectly fit and happy at all times. They were not shut in at night, but I was
always somewhat concerned for them in very cold weather as all Psittacula are
vulnerable to frostbitten feet. I am afraid that at that time I felt it worth risking a
loss as they were readily replaceable whilst the ban was raised on Parrot importation.
In the autumn, however, three birds were lost in cold, wet, changeable weather.
The first was a hen found dead on the floor of the flight, but as a considerable dis-
turbance had been heard during the night with owls, it was assumed that this was
a result and no post-mortem was made. The second and third were both cocks
and had precisely the same symptoms and result. Neither bird was thought to be
ill but just doubtful about nine o'clock in the morning, they were both watched almost
continuously for a couple of hours when it was decided to bring them in as a precau-
tion. One bird sat on the perch all day, ate nothing, looked better late at night,
and was dead early the next morning. The other bird seemed to collapse whilst
his cage was being warmed up and although he was only a doubtful bird when
I went for the cage, ten minutes later he was on the floor of the flight in a pretty
bad way and died in about four hours.
It would appear, therefore, that these birds are susceptible to pneumonia, but
are also extremely resistant to it in displaying any symptoms thus making diagnosis
almost impossible. The only remedy would appear to be prevention, as a cure is
almost out of the question at so short notice. Pneumonia in birds is almost always
incurable. I have tried penicillin, but this is useless if administered orally, it may
have a chance if injected into the blood by hypodermic. Recently, however, I have
heard of cures being effected with aureomycin on the continent (administered orally),
I have also tried it myself on two cases and both have been successfully saved. It
must be admitted that the steps were taken on suspicion rather than diagnosis, so that
although my birds recovered I cannot guarantee that they ever actually had
pneumonia. Perhaps some of our medical members can give further authentic
information on these possibilities.

PRINCESS OF WALES OR QUEEN ALEXANDRA PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996616875" page_id="56238213"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
I notice that in his interesting account of the National Show, Mr. Seth-Smith
deplores the fact that people will persist in referring to what he prefers to call the
Queen Alexandra Parrakeet, as the Princess of Wales Parrakeet, since, as he rightly
points out, England has had more than one Princess of Wales, but only one Queen
Alexandra.
Unfortunately, however, were his suggestion adopted, and taking into account
people's incurable habit of abbreviating names (Budgerigar . . . Budgie . . .
Budge !), I am afraid it would be no time at all before the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet
became simply the Alexandra Parrakeet.
This, in turn, would lead to endless confusion between the Alexandra Parrakeet
and the much commoner Alexandrine Parrakeet, and one can well imagine the
acrimonious correspondence that would ensue if somebody--possibly in all innocence--
sold one of the latter as one of the former !
I have sometimes heard Princess of Wales Parrakeets referred to as Princess Parra-
keets, but this does not matter so much, as there is no other Princess Parrakeet,
nor any with a name at all resembling it.

Mr. Seth-Smith, in his National Show report, says : "I wish they would not persist
in calling this bird the ' Princess of Wales Parrakeet
To be logical and correct one must call a bird by the name originally given to it.
This bird was named in 1862 and was therefore known by no other name until this
lady became Queen some forty years later. The fact that the title persists as the most
commonly used name for this bird to-day speaks for itself.
Surely it is not suggested that every time a title of address is altered for an individual,
the name given to anything as a mark of respect to that individual must also be
changed in scientific records. Otherwise we should now have to call the Stanley
Parrakeet the Derbyan, since it was named after the Earl of Derby who was then
Stanley, and what would happen to the other Derbyan Parrakeet. The Mrs. Johnstone
Lorikeet might have to become an entirely different bird if that lady had happened
to re-marry. A newly discovered species might be called the Cornwall Parrakeet,
later on this might be changed to the Prince of Wales Parrakeet, and even still later
to the King Charles Parrakeet. Let us be reasonable and stick to the most popular
and proper name, " Princess of Wales," in any case the scientific record retains
the essential dedication " alexandriae ".

BREEDING OF RED-BELLIED CONURES (. Pyrrhura vittata)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985217891891892" page_id="56238214"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
I am requested by Sir Edward Hallstrom to inform you that the birds he bred were
Red-bellied Conures (. Pyrrhura vittata ) as described on page 133 of Parrots and
Parrot-like Birds, by the Marquess of Tavistock.
The following notes, as dictated by Sir Edward on 8th February, 1954, no doubt
will be of interest to you and the Society members :--
These Conures were bred in an aviary approximately 3 feet wide, 6 feet high, and
16 feet long, with one end covered, back, sides, and top, for about 3 feet, and a cover
over the front of the aviary for about 3 feet to protect the food and water containers.
The nest used was an upright one of the grandfather clock type. Three eggs were
laid but only one chick was reared and this is now about twelve months old.
You may also be interested to know that during the last twelve months Sir Edward
has bred the following : 2 Musschenbroek's Parrots, 1 Double-eyed Dwarf Parrot,
8 Eclectus, 1 Alexandrine X Indian-Ringneck hybrid, 10 Hooded X Many-
coloured hybrids, 6 Hooded Parrots, 1 Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, 1 Blue-eyed
Cockatoo (New Britain), 60 to 70 African Lovebirds, such as the Peach-faced,
Masked, Black-cheeked, Fischers, as well as quite a number of lutino Nyassas, and
in addition to these, of course, Sir Edward has bred quite a number of the
commoner species such as Rosellas, Pennants, Scarlet-chested, Turquoisines, Red-
collared Lorikeets, etc.
Many of the young cock Hooded-Many-coloured hybrids are almost identical with
the Paradise Parrakeet, but unfortunately there has only been one female, which is at
present mated to an unrelated cock bird, and it will be very interesting to see the
results--if any.
The African Grey Parrots have had chicks and have reared them almost to maturity.
These birds nested in a vertical hollow log about 2 ft. 6 in. down from the top,
with wire netting on the side to enable the birds to get down easily, but it would almost
appear that the birds had jumped down on the young birds and killed them.
The Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos also damaged the wing of one of their
youngsters by jumping on them, but all nests are now on a slope to ensure that the
birds walk down and do not jump down on the youngsters.
At the present time there is a Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo sitting on an egg
and Sir Edward hopes that the young bird will appear within the next few days.
The Blue-eyed New Britain Cockatoos have bred in a heavy box-type nest and have
only had one chick at a time, although two eggs were laid on several occasions. It
was noted that the male sat on the egg most of the time, but occasionally both birds
were in the nest, but on the majority of occasions the hen was the only one seen
flying in the aviary.

The Musschenbroek's and Double-eyed Dwarf Parrots were most difficult to rear.
Although the Musschenbroek's, when first caught, is a seed-eater, it cannot rear the
youngsters on seed, and after losing several young birds I drove nails into the perches
nearest the door, and every morning pushed an apple on to each nail, and the birds
were thus able to feed their young ones with soft food. It was also impossible to
encourage the Musschenbroek's to go to the floor of the aviary for water, and as a result
the water was put on the same level as the food--about 5 feet from the ground. Many
young Double-eyed Dwarf Parrots were hatched and lost before I was able to give
them food on which they could rear their young. Millet or Pannicium seed that had
been boiled with figs and syrup solved the problem. This also created another problem
--ants. Although I have about 10 pairs of Double-eyed Dwarf Parrots the food
difficulty is such that I have only two pairs set up for breeding. Double-eyed Dwarf
Parrots will eat apples the same as described for the Musschenbroek's, and they will
also eat canary and sunflower seed, but destroy many more kernels than they eat.
At the moment there are two pairs of Macaws on eggs. The Blue and Yellow
and the Red and Yellow. The Red and Yellow have reared five youngsters this year,
but the Blue and Yellow have not yet been successful in rearing their youngsters.
About February each year for the last two years the Hyacinthine Macaws have
gone to nest, and have been observed mating. The eggs appear to have been fertile,
but neither clutch has hatched. A pair of young Hyacinthine Macaws are very
interested in one another and spend a considerable amount of time in the nest.
At the moment a pair of Blue and Yellow Macaws have three babies, whilst a pair
of Red and Yellow are sitting on eggs.

BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1953 AT HILLINGDON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.906968296296296" page_id="56238215"  page_num="77" year="" vol="">
Regarding breeding results for 1953, three pairs of Plumheads laid sixteen eggs
between them ; unfortunately these were all spoilt at various times during incubation
by cats getting on top of the flights and disturbing the hens. Bourkes reared five very
nice young and Cockatiels reared four ; in the case of Many-colours, seven eggs were
laid but no attempt was made to incubate. Elegants had two clutches of five eggs,
both being infertile, likewise the Princess of Wales had eight eggs, found to be infertile
after sitting the full time. A yellow Redrump also had four eggs but was disturbed
whilst sitting. Stanleys, Barrabands, and Rock Peplars all spent a great deal of time
in their nest-boxes but did not lay.
Good fortune, however, was registered by having a brood of three Painted Finches
reared ; all turned out cocks, a second pair nested and laid two clutches of five eggs
but made no attempt to sit. One pair of Gouldians, Black-headed cock and Red-
headed hen, nested, reared two very fine youngsters and carried on in the same nest
without a break, producing two more ; eight clear eggs were found when clearing
out their nest-box ; incidentally, this pair have gone to nest again and have youngsters.
Three other pairs did precisely nothing towards increasing the Gouldian population.
So much for 1953, what of 1954?
As planned, it is up to two pairs of Plumheads, two pairs of Many-colours, two pairs
of Bourkes, two pairs of Rock Peplars, a pair of Cockatiels, a pair of Moustache, I
hope to emulate friend Vane's success with these attractive and amusing birds.
A pair of Princess of Wales and Barrabands, and finally four pairs of Gouldians plus
youngsters, and two pairs of Painted Finches; not a terrific collection by some standards
but enough to cope with in a limited leisure.

(\0x25A0Cyanomilra verticalis verticalis)
By Gerald T. Iles (Belle Vue Zoo, Manchester, England)
The Green-headed Olive Sunbird, or, as it is also known, the
Olive-backed Sunbird, is not one of the most brilliantly coloured of
the family, but it is quite pleasingly marked and is of special interest
because the hen has a cap of metallic green. A detailed description
of the birds is hardly necessary in view of Mr. Reid Henry's exquisite
plate accompanying this article. I feel I should mention, however,
that because of the hen's unusual possession of the metallic cap she
was once considered to be a distinct species. Shelley, in his Monograph
of the Nectarinida , shows both sexes with pectoral tufts, the cock's being
very pale yellow while the hen's are shown as white. Bannerman, in
his Birds of West Africa , says that the hen does not possess pectoral
tufts, while Jackson, in his Birds of Kenya and Uganda , states that in the
sub-species Cyanomitra verticalis viridisplendens the hen's pectoral tufts
are white but not so well developed as in the cock. While the pectoral
tufts on our cock bird are visible at all times I am not certain about
the hen. She appears to have a few pale yellow feathers at the shoulder
tips.
Our pair of Sunbirds were caught by natives in the Kissy coastal
area near Freetown, Sierra Leone, for Mr. Kenneth Smith during
the early part of 1951, and he brought them to England and subse-
quently to the Zoo in May of that year. Where they were found this
species is fairly common and the birds were seen feeding from flowers
on several occasions. Ours were sent to us as a mature and an
immature cock, but with the aid of Shelley's Monograph I quickly
identified them as a true pair. The two birds have always been kept
in separate cages, as I have had unhappy experiences with fights.
The cock bird is exhibited in the range of Sunbirds in our Hall of
Living Jewels, while the hen has always been kept in the Stock Room
where she has become quite a pet.
Each evening I feed all the Sunbirds myself, and through doing so

G. T. ILES - THE GREEN-HEADED OLIVE SUNBIRD
I have had quite a lot of personal contact with this particular pair.
I have become greatly attached to the hen and find she has a very
charming and confiding nature. She appears to be entirely without
fear, and a finger presented to the front of the cage brings her over
immediately in order that she can probe around the nail with her
beak, while the tip of the tongue is gently extruded. I catch spiders
for this Sunbird on every possible occasion, and she becomes extremely
excited when she sees me approaching with one in a bottle. Whether
spiders are available or not she always has a mealworm each night
"to go to bed with ". I pinch off the top of the mealworm and
squeeze out the soft parts and present it to her in this way. Her method
never varies ; she always swallows the soft parts of the worm in two
or three gulps, and then takes the body of the mealworm in her beak
and generally plays around with it until she finally loses interest and
allows it to fall. When I am replacing the liquid for the night feed
the hen Green-headed Olive is the last Sunbird in the line, and if she
feels I am taking too long about reaching her an inquiring head comes
through the front of the bars and I see her beady eye watching me
along the line of cages. She looks particularly beautiful when she
does this, as there is a light point immediately above her cage and
with the head through the bars the metallic feathers catch the full
glow of light so that they glitter like a jewel. When I approach with
the re-filled feeding bottle the bird never waits until it is clipped into
place, but she is always so keen to feed that her head is pushed through
the bars to drink before I have an opportunity of clipping the bottle
into position. She has a pretty little twittering noise at times but
over the three years in which I have had her I have only heard this
song on a very few occasions.
The cock bird is in a glass-fronted exhibition cage and is not quite
so tame as the hen. He has, however, one rather endearing habit :
when I have replaced the feeding bottle at night he always gives what
sounds to me like a cry of derision as I am closing the door of his cage.
To conclude, I would like to ask a question in the hope that some
readers of the Magazine might be able to help me. Why do Sunbirds
place various materials in the spouts of their feeding bottles ? Not
only do the Green-headed Olive do this but many other species of
Sunbirds as well. I have noticed that mealworms, sawdust, and even
small pebbles are dropped into the open spouts of the bottles.

By David M. West (Montebello, Calif., U.S.A.)
Probably one of the recurring difficulties the average aviculturist
is confronted with is the problem of just how to keep more birds
without continually expanding his facilities. The possibility of
keeping more than one pair of psittacine birds together and still
breeding them, is the obvious answer, and yet this solution can be
filled with problems and dangers.
The standard texts dealing with psittacine birds under avicultural
conditions do not shed much light on the possibilities of keeping two
breeding pairs of birds in a single breeding aviary. The usual remarks
are to the effect that the bird under consideration can or cannot
be kept in a mixed collection. This is altogether unsatisfactory
information--for what we need to know is just what birds may be
kept together in a mixed breeding situation.
Over a course of several years I have kept a number of birds
together in breeding pens which average some fifteen feet long, four
feet wide, and seven feet high. As a result of this experiment I have
found that some birds can very definitely be kept together in a breeding
situation where peace and calm exist during the entire year.
Whenever the situation arises where one decides to mix the occupants
of an aviary it is a very good plan to have two separate feeding and
watering stations to begin the experiment. In some cases the only
antagonism shown is at feeding time when the stronger pair of birds
may scare the other pair of psittacines away from the feeding station.
Over an extended period of time this can result in a gradual weakening
of a bird's stamina--&amp;apos;but this situation can be easily overcome with
two separate feeding stations. A second consideration that is wise, is
to place the weaker or more timid pair of birds into their new cage
a few days prior to introducing the second pair of birds that you feel
might be the aggressors. This method gives the more timid pair
the chance to learn the cage and to learn where the higher perches
are, and so avoid the first days nervousness when the second pair of
birds are introduced.
The only real difficulty arises during the springtime, when mating
and nesting become the order of the day. This quarrelling over nesting
sites is the serious part of determining the success of the entire venture.
By placing the nest-boxes in different parts of the aviary, and by
providing a variety of nests, some of the difficulties may be eliminated.
If one, or both, of the pairs of the birds have previously nested it is a
good idea to give them their former nest-box for then they will gener-
ally take to this box, and the question of property rights is decided
without fussing and fighting.

D. M. WEST-FACTORS IN MIXING PSITTACINES
The following is a list of some of the birds that I have kept under
mixed conditions, and the general results of such a practice.
Queen Alexandra's. This species is very easy to mix with other
birds that are not too aggressive. I have kept pairs of Alexandras
with Bourke's, Turquoisines, Elegants, and Scarlets, with perfect
results. They will also agree with budgies, single pairs of African
Agapornis (except Peach-face), and with Cockatiels, Plum-heads,
and Javan Parrakeets. In very large pens I would have no hesitancy
in mixing them with Kings, Crimson-wings, or small American Parrots
as Lineolated, etc.
Barraband's. This is another species that is most charming in
mixed company. They will agree with practically all birds, indeed
one must be careful not to put them with smaller but more active
and aggressive birds, for they are not really capable of protecting
themselves. Besides the Neophema , they are safe with even some of
the larger birds as Indian Rock Parrots. I have not seen them ever
become aggressive even to very small birds such as Zebra Finches.
Crimson-wings. Individual pairs differ greatly in disposition.
One pair I have will agree with anything I place with them, while a
second pair agreed with Barraband's for a while and then the male
Crimson-wing became increasingly aggressive, and they were finally
separated. With birds of this individual variation it would be best to
try them out on a day when the owner is around to watch. A single
pair of Red-rumps kept for a short time with a pair of the Crimson-
wings proved to be absolutely impossible, for the Red-rumps literally
drove the Crimson-wings to distraction, chasing them and making
their lives miserable. It has always been my experience that Red-
rumps are totally impossible to keep with others birds--regardless
of the size of the birds they are to have as " room-mates
Kings. These rather phlegmatic birds are of a peaceful disposition.
They seem to like to sit on a perch alone--and the only time my pair
would get upset was when some Neophema would fly to the perch the
King would be dozing upon. Then, with great effort, the King would
walk towards the bird and scold it off that perch to another--and
then resume his nap where he had been interrupted. Kings will
agree with Indian birds such as Plum-heads and Ring-necks, and
related Indian birds. The one difficulty in keeping other birds in !
with Kings is that a King takes so much space while flying that it not
infrequently alarms the other pair of birds. For this reason a steady j
pair of birds would be the best choice. In very large aviaries Kings
are most desirable, for they will not bother anyone, and there is little I
chance for a quarrel over a nest, for most California Kings delight in ,
dropping their eggs from the perch--or at best in just laying them
hither and thither about the aviary.

Barraband's are equally applicable here. Indeed, the Rock is such
a lazy bird that it would appear nearly impossible to upset its placid
disposition.
Neophema. These birds are quite easy to mix in with other species
that are not too aggressive. They are clever flyers, and so are not easily
frightened by some larger, clumsy bird. They require a small nest-
box that can be placed up very close to the roof of the cage, so that
there is just enough room for them to perch on top of the nest--and
very few of the larger birds will try to inspect more than once the small
box required for the Grass Parrots. Their steady habits, once used to
the aviary, make them ideal for keeping under mixed conditions.
Rosellas. These birds are extremely difficult to keep in with
other birds at any time of the year--and during the spring nearly
impossible. Individual pairs differ greatly in their temperament.
In a large mixed collection some years ago we had a pair of Red
Rosellas that raised young each year, and never bothered the other
birds ( Agapornis and Neophema) at any time. In smaller breeding
cages I would not try to mix any of the Platycercus with anything else
during the breeding season. Of the group the Red and the Blue seem
to be the most aggressive--even to budgies and Zebras, etc. The
Pennant's and the Stanley seem to be a little more amenable to group
life--but I have never actually tried them with any other bird.
Possibly some other reader could shed additional light on this matter.
Barnard grouping. Like their near allies, the Platycercus , all the
Barnardius are inclined to be bullying and aggressive during the Spring
season. For this reason I have never kept adult Barnard's in with
other birds. Birds of the year are perfectly safe, though Barnard's
work in pairs when it comes to bullying other inmates of an aviary.
Psephotus. This group contains some birds that I personally
consider absolutely impossible subjects for communal living--and
other members that are ideal subjects. The Red-rump I have already
commented upon--and I have had Red-rumps (working in pairs)
actually murder Zebra Finches, budgies, and Button Quail. The
Blue-bonnets are reputed to be very dangerous and aggressive with
other birds--though this has not been our experience. In a large mixed
collection consisting mostly of odd birds (and the majority males at
that), a pair of Blue-bonnets have lived peacefully for over a year.
In another cage where a budgie had entered through an error, no
attempt was made to murder the budgie. They also appear to be
happy with Queen Alexandras and Cockatiels. One thing is sure
though--one male Blue-bonnet couldn't be happier than when he
is engaged in combat with another of his own species. It is a very
poor policy to keep this bird near other Blue-bonnets, for the owner
will eventually end up with a number of toeless birds from fights
taking place on the wire. Hooded are perfect in every respect and

are never aggressive to other birds. Because the Hooded generally
nest at a period in the year when any other bird in its right mind
is moulting or resting, there is very little occasion to worry over fights
concerning nesting sites. Many-colours are variable in their disposi-
tions. One breeding pair will not tolerate any living thing in their
aviary while they are nesting--and even hate and fight the English
Sparrows that sometimes alight on their aviary. Another pair is
never upset, and though I have not kept birds with this pair during
the spring breeding season, the pair were not upset when a year ago
a young Bourke got into their aviary when a door accidentally came
open. Not wanting to frighten the Many-colours who had young in
the nest, I did not catch the Bourke, and he stayed in with the Many-
colours for over a month with no bad results.
Asiatic Parrakeets. The only Asiatic psittacines kept in California
are the Plum-head, Derbyan, Ring-neck, Alexandrine, and Javan and
Moustache. They all seem quite well disposed to company in their
aviary, and are not over aggressive. Of the birds mentioned, possibly
the most problematical are the Ring-necks. Individual pairs will
differ greatly in their behaviour towards other birds--some pairs
agreeing and others bullying other birds. I think that the answer
here is space--for Ring-necks do agree well in an aviary that is
spacious. Moustache and Javan are both peaceful and the large and
fierce looking Alexandrine seems the most peaceful of the entire lot.
The Derbyan is another bird that does not resent companions--
agreeing very well even with budgies. As all the Asiatic Parrakeets
nest very early in the year (as compared to the average Australian),
there is not much likelihood of any serious disagreement over nesting
sites.
African species. Apart from the Senegal Parrot, which seems
another perfect aviary inmate, the only commonly kept Africans
(here in California) are the various Agapornis. I have found that
single pairs of the Agapornis will agree well with any of the larger
birds--both living and nesting well with them. Peach-faces are
certainly the most aggressive and I feel the least reliable in mixed
collections.
I would not trust the various African Lovebirds with small budgies
and finches, but with larger birds they are perfectly safe. As they are
very clever about tumbling quickly into their nests, there is little
chance that a larger pair of birds would want the Lovebird's nest,
filled with straw and leaves, as is generally the case. By hanging the
Lovebird nest up close to the roof and leaving just enough space for
the Lovebirds to sit on the nest top, all should be calm and peaceful.
I frequently allow no perch outside the nesting entrance to stop or at
least help prevent the larger and curious birds from looking in with
such great ease. Last year a female Barraband made regular visits

to a young family of Bourke's by sitting on the perch outside the
entrance hole and looking in at the mother Bourke feeding her babies.
As the Bourke's did not object all was well--but this year the Barraband
will have a hard time because the perch has been removed. This
makes the entrance to the nest a little more difficult for the smaller
birds too--but they do not seem to mind, and are certainly not
discouraged by this.
American species. The beauty of some of the American psittacine
species is undeniably great, but this is quite eclipsed by their voices.
For this reason they have not been extensively kept even here in
California. Some of the species appear to be not too aggressive, while
others may be considered as too aggressive for mixed company. The
only collection containing many American species here in California
is that of Mr. G. Rayson Brown in Arcadia. On visits to his aviaries
I have noticed that some Conures are being kept in with other birds--
but generally they are just unmated odds and ends. Possibly he would
let us know his observations on these American species. Mr. J.
Buteyn, at San Luis Rey, also keeps some excellent American species,
and at least two of the Conures in his collection have not been
identified.
Lories. The Lories are so very aggressive that they cannot be
kept with other birds. Mr. G. R. Brown once told me that a cock
Ring-neck accidentally got into a pen containing a pair of Dusky
Lories, and that by the time he discovered this, all that was left of the
Ring-neck was a pile of green feathers on the floor. It does appear
quite possible to mix Lories together, for Mr. Sheffler has done this
in Arizona, keeping a number of different kinds together, but in
aviaries, with no nesting facilities.
Eclectus. These large and beautiful Parrots do not seem to object
to having companions. A pair in my father's collection have a pair of
Cockatiels in their pen, and both the Eclectus and the Cockatiels get
along fine. A second pair do not object to some lutino budgies that
are housed with them. Some of the larger Parrots are slow moving, and
so not likely to cause any trouble with any companions that are swift
on the wing.
In a large pen (some 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and about 12 feet
high) the possibilities of keeping a variety of odds and ends is enormous.
At the present time in this pen there are a large number of birds
that are either too young to breed or a mate is not available for them.
The following birds are all living in a state of contentment and agree-
ment : a cock Blue Rosella, a cock Stanley, female Yellow Rosella,
a cock Barraband, female Crimson-wing, three Ring-necks, a young
Pileated, a pair of young Many-colours, a Lineolated, a pair of Eclectus,
a Cockatiel, and a Blue-bonnet. In addition to this there were (prior
to their being mated up) a King, a Red Rosella, and a Pennant's.

D. H. S. RISDON-NOTES ON HARTLAUB'S TOURAGOS
Although this cage contains birds that doubtless would fight one |
another in smaller aviaries, their present home appears large enough
for all to live in peace. The precautions of double feeding stations
and drinking fountains are doubtless no hindrance to the present
happy state.
I think that the most important points in mixing psittacines are the
double feeding and drinking stations, the provisions of nesting sites
that are as far apart as is possible, and the provision of suitable
perching facilities. It would be most interesting to have other members'
experiences in mixing various birds. Who knows--maybe I'll find
some place to put one more pair of birds without building a new

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
Cecil Webb's very interesting article in a recent issue of the
Magazine concerning the wild life of these birds prompts me to write
the following notes on observations I have made of their habits in
captivity.
In 1950 there was an adult pair of Hartlaub's Touracos at Dudley
Zoo. They were housed in one of the large flight cages in the Bird
House on their own, and that being my first summer at Dudley I was
bitten with the desire to try and breed them.
I had no idea whether or not they were a true pair. There was
certainly no obvious difference between them as far as appearance
went, but they got on well together so we fixed up a bunch of twigs
in a corner of the flight. The middle of this was flattened out and a
shallow dish-shaped piece of wire netting was fixed to form a platform.
On this some coarse hay was shaped to form a foundation for a nest.
Needless to say this corner of the cage was screened from the public
to give the birds as much privacy as possible.
Much to our delight the birds took to this nesting site almost at
once. They spent a good deal of each day sitting on the platform
side by side and I think they roosted there at night. I did not know
then, as I discovered later, that these Touracos much prefer to roost
on a platform of this nature rather than a perch, and in subsequent
years, when I had them in an outdoor aviary containing several
open-fronted nest-boxes, they invariably used them to sleep in.
In spite, however, of taking so well to the site we made for them
the birds made no obvious attempt to build a nest. They did, however,
show other signs of breeding condition. One bird, presumably the
male, fed the other one with food regurgitated from the crop and

frequently displayed by tilting its head right back till its crest touched
its back, exposing the throat, meanwhile uttering a low growling note.
A form of threat display is to depress the crest which has the effect
of enhancing the white patches in front of the eyes. At such times
these patches appear dazzlingly white and are obviously intended to
intimidate a rival. These are the only displays I have ever seen them
do which is surprising considering the lovely colouring of Hartlaub's
Touracos. Somehow I would have expected them to show the beautiful
carmine of the flight feathers, but this never seems to be seen except
when the birds are flying.
Matters continued in this sort of stalemate for some weeks and
I began to think our efforts had been in vain and that the birds were
just spoofing us, when suddenly one died. To our intense disappoint-
ment the post-mortem examination revealed an impacted egg in the
oviduct, so that was that. Subsequent events, of which more anon,
have more or less proved the other bird to be a cock and I am afraid
that, although we imported some more the next year, the bird that
died was the only hen we had.
The newly imported birds consisted of four obviously hand-reared
specimens in immature plumage. This was like that of the adult,
but all the colours were duller. Of these one died soon after arrival
and we placed the other three with the single old bird in the Bird
House where they passed the winter.
By the following spring the young ones had moulted into adult
plumage and then trouble started. First one died suddenly and
mysteriously, and some weeks later two of the remainder set about the
third. Fortunately it was discovered what was happening in time
and the odd bird was removed. Naturally I thought the two
aggressors were a true pair which had come into breeding condition,
and that summer (1952) I removed them to my garden aviary which
is planted and not being directly accessible to the public has some
degree of privacy.
Here the birds spent the summer and did absolutely nothing in
spite of being given a variety of nesting sites in the shape of open-
fronted boxes, closed boxes with only a hole entrance, and wire plat-
forms fixed both in the growing bushes, as well as in bunches of twigs
fixed up on the walls. They did, however, use the boxes for sleeping
in, but never together as did the original pair. Each bird slept in a
separate box. They never went to them until dusk when, having
carefully looked about them, to see if the coast was clear, they made
a sudden dive into their respective boxes and settled down for the
night.
Although they didn't breed they did, however, give me a lot of
joy in watching them in a really big aviary where they could show
their graceful flight with the flash of brilliant carmine as they glided

D. H. S. RISDON- 0 --NOTES ON HARTLAUB's TOURACOS
from perch to perch. I think if I were only allowed to keep one sort
of bird I should plump for Touracos. They seem to me to combine
all the best qualities of the pigeon, parrot and pheasant families
rolled into one. Their colouring is exquisite, and their movements i
the essence of gracefulness whether in flight or hopping, skipping and
jumping along their perches. Moreover, they have delightful voices
which, calling across the garden on a summer's day, make you feel
they really have brought a bit of their native jungle with them.
It might be as well to record here the various noises they can make.
Besides the well-known Touraco call " wowk wowk wowk " which
both sexes seem to use when they are feeling pleased with themselves,
there is the growling display note described above, which is also
used as a note of aggression. The alarm note is a high pitched " chip
chip " and anger aroused say at the sight of a cat is expressed in a
kind of chatter which cannot be imitated in writing.
As my garden aviary is only a summer one and has no proper
shelter, the Touracos were transferred to one of the Zoo aviaries for
the winter where, apart from being shut in at night, they had no
extra protection in the way of heat. They came through the Dudley
winter, which can be extremely bleak, in fine fettle, which I think
proves them to be a hardy species.
When the spring of 1953 came round I again transferred them to
my garden aviary and as they still showed no sign of attempting to
nest I thought I would see what a little jealousy would do. So I
caught up the odd remaining bird which all this time had been
living in the Bird House, and put him in with them. I stood by,
half expecting there to be a frightful row, remembering how they had
attacked him eighteen months before, but not a bit of it. Both birds
jumped up one on each side of the newcomer and there ensued what
I can only describe as a lot of billing and cooing between all three.
So far from fighting they all seemed frightfully pleased to see each other
and began feeding each other indiscriminately !
I felt justified, therefore, in leaving all three together to see what
would happen. All this time, remember, I had been assuming that
the original two were a pair. I had watched them and noted what
I thought were differences in their appearance--more white on the
facial markings of the cock and so on, but that's where I tripped up
and my experience only goes to show how easily one can jump to
conclusions. After some weeks of living in harmony the bird which
I always supposed to have been the hen became somewhat aggressive
towards the other two, then the position would be reversed and one
of the others would seem to be top dog for a while.
No serious quarrelling took place, however, and I was content to
let well alone, thinking that perhaps they were at last being stimulated
into breeding condition.

D. H. S. RISDON-NOTES ON HARTLAUB's TOURACOS 89
Alas for my hopes. One morning after a period of tranquility in
the aviary I noticed the newly introduced bird was missing. With
a sinking heart I searched the aviary and eventually found its corpse
crammed in a corner completely scalped. This made me think more
than ever that the survivors were a true pair, but this winter, for
accommodation reasons they were put back in the Bird House in
one of the large built-in cages. They had not been there long before
one set about the other and, but for the timely intervention of one
of the keepers, would undoubtedly have met the fate of the other bird.
As it was the feathers were scalped from the back of its head.
We are now left with two Hartlaub's Touracos living apart and
I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion after three years' trying,
that all our birds except the first one which died of egg trouble,
must have been males--hence no efforts to nest.
Hartlaub's Touracos appear to be perfectly hardy. They stayed
each year in an open aviary with only a bit of overhead shelter till
well into October when night ground frosts were experienced. Even
then they showed no discomfort and were only moved into more
sheltered conditions because they are too rare and valuable to be
trifled with.
They seem to be entirely fruit eaters and provided plenty of this
is supplied, will eat little else. They will take boiled carrot, boiled
potato, soaked bread and insectile food under protest, but never
touch it if there is plenty of fruit. Grapes and cherries are favourites
and privet berries are liked. They have large gapes and swallow
grapes and cherries whole, disgorging the stones later. After
swallowing a large cherry they sit still with a fatuous expression
looking extremely uncomfortable for a few moments while it slips
down.
They are keen bathers and although I have examined their bath
water most carefully on many occasions, I have never seen any sign
of the red colouring matter from their flight feathers being dissolved
in the water.

A splendid collection of mammals, birds, and reptiles presented to
the Zoological Society in commemoration of the Coronation and the
Royal tour of Australia and Tasmania, arrived in London on the
8th April.
Sir Edward Hallstrom was instrumental in arranging this
magnificent gift, and sent two of his staff, Mr. W. Turner and Mr. E.
Hargreaves, to care for the collection on the long sea voyage. Due to
first-class packing and expert care, the specimens arrived in excellent
condition.
Taronga Zoological Park Trust ; Sir Edward Hallstrom ;
Mr. David Fleay, the Zoological Society of Southern Australia ; the
Animals 5 and Birds' Protection Board, Hobart ; the Agent-General
for Tasmania ; the Zoological Board of Victoria, and the Zoological
Gardens of Perth all contributed generously to the collection, which
totalled some 190 specimens.
The rarest of the birds are two Baudin's or White-tailed Black
Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus baudini), the first to be brought alive to this
country for many years. A pair of Greater Palm Cockatoos ( Probosciger
aterrimus) of Cape York peninsula and the opposite coastal areas of
New Guinea makes another attractive exhibit and an interesting com-
parison with two of the very closely allied Aru Island form that have
been in the Parrot House since 1927 and 1946 respectively.
Other exhibits of especial interest that have not been in the collec-
tion since before the war are Tawny Frogmouths ( Podargus strigoides ),
three of them hand-reared by Mr. Fleay ; Australian Cranes ( Grus
rubicundo) ; White-backed and Black-backed Piping Crows ( Gymnor-
hina hypoleuca leuconota and G. tibicen) ; Cereopsis Geese ( Cereopsis
novae-hollandiae) , and Maned Geese (Chenonetta jubata).

R. G. KIRKHAM-SIR EDWARD HALLSTROM's PARRAKEETS 91
A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF A WONDERFUL DAY
SPENT IN SEEING SIR EDWARD HALLSTROM'S
COLLECTION OF PARRAKEETS IN SYDNEY,
N.S.W., DECEMBER, 1953

By R. G. Kirkham (Clonskeagh, Co. Dublin, Eire)
I had come to Australia for a health trip, and to get away from the
Irish winter, and was armed with a letter of introduction to that fairy
godfather of Australian Aviculture, Sir Edward J. Hallstrom. Im-
mediately on my arrival in Sydney I sent off my letter to him, and
then sailed away for a short visit to Fiji and New Caledonia. Within
twenty-four hours of sailing I received a Marconigram on board
which read : " Delighted to see you on your return to Sydney," and
Sir Edward was indeed as good as his word. I called at his office by
appointment, and was cordially received and introduced to his chief
collector and zoologist, Walter H. Turner, with the instruction to
" show him everything ", and that is just what he did.
We started out the following morning at 8.30 a.m., and went first
to Sir Edward's beautiful home at Northbridge, which is situated on
a narrow neck of land overlooking Sydney Harbour. There the
principal collection is housed, in all about 860 birds. The aviaries are
built on three sides of the house, and take up, I would say at a guess,
about two acres or perhaps a little more. Sir Edward has a great
fondness for Macaws and Cockatoos, and where in the past I have
seen perhaps five or six in a zoo collection, Sir Edward keeps no less
than 67 Macaws of all the well-known species, including several pairs
of the giant " Hyacinth " looking very beautiful and in tip-top condi-
tion, with not a feather astray. One pair in particular were obviously
in breeding condition, making a great fuss of each other. The cock
sitting close up beside his wife with " one arm around her neck "
as Sir Edward put it. After visiting the Macaws, and feeling a little
overwhelmed by them, I asked about Lovebirds, as these are great
favourites of mine, and was taken to a range of aviaries each measuring
about 10 feet by 6 and 7 feet high. There I was truly amazed to see
in each compartment a flock of Lovebirds, nothing less. Sir Edward
told me that at the start of each season he puts six or eight pairs of
birds in each compartment, with plenty of nest-boxes, and allows
them to go ahead without let or hindrance. At the end of the breeding
season he usually finishes up with 35 or 40 youngsters in each division,
and this goes for Peach-faced (Agapornis roseicollis ) as well as the
other less pugnacious species. I discussed this phenomenon with Walt
Turner, and it is his considered opinion that if only a couple of pairs
are kept together they usually fight for want of something better to

do, but if four or five pairs share the same compartment, they are so
busy increasing the Lovebird population they haven't the time, or the
inclination, to fight, and large and happier families are the result.
This is something which will be only of purely academic interest to
most Lovebird breeders at home, as very few of us have more than one
or two pairs of any but Fischer's or Masked, and are too scared of
losing any by fighting to risk more than one pair to a compartment.
It gave me a great thrill to see about 40 Black-cheeked and 20 or
30 Nyasas, but the biggest surprise of all was to see ten of the lovely
little lutino Nyasas looking, as Ted Vane so aptly put it on one
occasion, like " little irate Colonels ", their orange-red cheeks giving
them a really fiery appearance ! Last, but by no means least, about
40 Peach-faced sitting in a row, and living in harmony together.
They reminded me of the words of a popular song : " And never is
heard a discouraging word," etc.
Having seen and marvelled at the Lovebirds, I mentioned " Princess
of Wales " Parrakeets. I liked them so much, and was the proud
possessor of an excellent pair. Sir Edward quietly took me to an
enclosure near the Macaws, and there I saw them rise in a cloud
from the ground where they had been feeding. I just could not guess
how many there were, but there seemed to be at least a couple of
dozen pairs. They all lived happily with a pair of Blue-bonnets, several
pairs of Hooded and Many-colours, and one or two odd birds, and
what a picture they made !
After leaving the " Princess of Wales " with reluctance, we made
our way to another range of aviaries constructed of concrete, coloured
and shaped to look like logs, and of very attractive appearance. These
housed a very large and varied collection of Cockatoos, numbering
about sixty-five in all, which included the Yellow-tailed Black, the
Red-tailed Black, and the White-tailed Black. There were also
several pairs of the Palm Cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus) very Black !
very Beautiful, and, I should say, very hard to handle ! I might
mention in passing I also saw a lone specimen of the Lesser Vasa
Parrot, also known as the Pigeon Parrot of Madagascar. This is a most
unusual looking slim bird, washy black in colour, with a small head,
and light-coloured horn beak, about the size of a Rock Pebbler,
but with a very long neck, which to my mind, quite spoils its appear-
ance. The lovely little Musschenbroek's from New Guinea, a small
dwarf parrot, green shading to yellow, with a crimsom breast, is a very
friendly little bird which Sir Edward has recently been successful in
breeding. In a nearby enclosure was a whole flock of little Fig Parrots
(the Double-eyed Dwarf), little bigger than a Lovebird, the cocks
with dark red heads and the hens with grey heads. Noisy and
chattering, never still, always on the move, they made a most attractive
sight.

R. G. KIRKHAM-SIR EDWARD HALLSTROM's PARRAKEETS 93
I also had a very good look at seven Glossy Black Cockatoos, but as
there is quite a story attached to them, they must be the subject of
some further notes.
After a cup of morning tea with Sir Edward, I was whisked away
to his week-end retreat at Mona Vale, about 25 miles outside Sydney,
where a small collection of about 100 of the most prized specimens are
housed, and there I saw three of the most rare and wonderful Parrakeets
in Australia, which I believe nobody else possesses at the moment.
Four pairs of " Paradise Parrakeets ", two cock Golden-shouldered
Parrakeets and a Ground Parrakeet, and all in the same collection,
virtually rubbing shoulders together. If I say it was worth travelling
from Ireland to see the " Paradise Parrakeets " alone, I know my
readers will understand and forgive my enthusiasm. How can I
describe them ? The cock is a long, slim bird with the forehead and
under tail-coverts red ; the crown of the head black, the face and
breast bright green shading to a blue which reminds one of shining
butterfly wings, and the whole bird looking a most graceful and
enchanting sight, enough to delight the heart and, whisper it, arouse
a little touch of envy in every true bird keeper. My description of this
beautiful bird (I'm liable to run out of adjectives when talking about
it) is perhaps a little sketchy, but as Sir Edward kindly allowed me
to take a colour film of the birds, and they were most co-operative,
I am looking forward to seeing, for the first time on any screen, " The
Paradise Parrakeet." It should, of course, be explained that they
are really Hooded X Many-coloured Parrakeet hybrids.
The Golden-shouldered Parrakeets, also very rare, and to be found only
in one or two places in Australia, was believed by many to be extinct, but
was rediscovered by Walt Turner to take their place in Sir Edward's
collection. The cock has a black head with a bright golden-yellow
frontal band and golden-yellow patches on the wings and shoulders,
and the body is bluish-green. The hen is a pale edition of the cock,
with the body yellowish-green instead of blue. I might add that the
colours of both cock and hen appear to change in different lights.
The Ground Parrakeet is stated in all the best books to be found
in the coastal areas in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
and Tasmania, but I'm told on very good authority, that less than
half a dozen are known to exist in aviaries throughout Australia, in
fact very few bird keepers have ever seen one, let alone kept it.
Mr. Turner told me they have had great difficulty in keeping theirs.
The bird is very nervous and shy, hiding in the grass on the floor of the
aviary, and then at the slightest noise or disturbance, hurling itself at
the wire netting. It will be interesting to know if a mate can be
found and if it can be persuaded to go to nest in an aviary. Time
alone will tell.
Sir Edward also possesses the largest collection of Birds of Paradise

in the world, and he is coming to Switzerland in May to lecture on
them, their habits and nuptial display, and as I am sure, complete and
comprehensive reports will appear in the Magazine, I propose to
refrain from comment !
In concluding these notes, I should like to express my thanks and
pay tribute to the generosity of Sir Edward Hallstrom. He has done
more than any man alive to save many beautiful species of Australian
birds from extinction, to preserve them for posterity, and to make it
possible for aviculturists in many lands to enjoy their beauty, by
sending them to zoos all over the world.
After my visit to Mona Vale, I felt I had seen everything that
mattered in the avian world, but not so. Walt Turner took me to
Taronga Park, and there I saw many of the treasures presented to
Taronga by Sir Edward. Having spent a few hours there, I came to
the conclusion that Taronga was misnamed. It really should have
been called Hallstrom Park, because Sir Edward, more than anyone
else, is responsible for Taronga Park being the finest zoo in the southern
hemisphere.
About the birds in Taronga I shall try to tell you a little later !

Of the four Vieillot's Fire-back Pheasants hatched late last summer
one has survived and could now be regarded as being fully reared.
Hopkinson records successes in France, but so far as I know this is

In my view the common names of birds should, where practicable, be descriptive
of their form, plumage, voice, habits, habitat, or distribution, and they should
never be named after persons.
In the case of the Queen Alexandra's or Princess of Wales' Parrakeet, a far better
name would be the Pink-throated (or even the Racquet-winged), while the
Alexandrine (presumably named after Alexander the Great) should be the Greater
Indian Ring-necked.
Terms like splendid, beautiful, superb, and so on, should not be used. The Blue-
backed Manakin is a better name than the Superb for this member of a family
containing many superb birds, while there are plenty of Sunbirds other than those
so named that are beautiful, splendid, and superb.
The Many-coloured Parrakeet is well named, but Paradise Parrakeet, Tanager,
Whydah, or Shelduck are meaningless. The Elegant Grass Parrakeet is not more
elegant than others of the genus, all of which, by the way, are blue-winged.
Names like Festive Amazon, Mercenary Amazon, and Sordid Parrot are unsuitable,
but not more absurd than those given to " Amazons " coming from districts as far
from the Amazon valley as the West Indies or the forms of " Senegal " Parrot living
far from Senegal.
There used to be a story of a London dealer who, finding that trade in Avadavats
was poor, advertised them as Tiger Finches, whereupon they sold like hot cakes.
If Avadavats bore the slightest resemblance to tigers, he would have been justified
in changing this corruption of Ahmadabad.

SPLENDID X TURQUOISINE GRASS PARRAKEET HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99336525" page_id="56238241"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
In the past Turquoisine Grass Parrakeets have bred well for me, and, perhaps due
to the climate, Splendids have not done so well. I thought a hybrid between the
two might perhaps be more hardy, and in this I may possibly be right, because
during the last two seasons I have bred fourteen hybrids--eight in 1952 and six
in 1953 -
The cock hybrid is very pretty and looks like the cock Splendid, except that the
red on the breast is not so extensive and it has the small red patch of the Turquoisine
on the shoulder. Without the latter it would be difficult to distinguish it from the
pure Splendid. Apart from the fact that the blue is not so deep on the face of the
hen hybrid she looks exactly like a pure Splendid. This lighter colour is so slight
that it might not even be noticed. I tried to breed with two pairs of the hybrids
last season, but had only clear eggs. Edward Boosey suggests that they may be
fertile in the second year.
Last season I also bred nineteen Bourkes--from two pairs, one Brown's X Mealy,
four green Indian Ring-necks and two lutino, two Barraband's, one Crimson-wing,
twelve Masked Lovebirds, two Turquoisines, two Elegants, one Barnard's, eight

During the course of Mr. Stuart's Exploratory Expedition into Central Australia
in 1862 Mr. Frederick G. Waterhouse made an ornithological collection. The
Board of Governors of the South Australian Institute forwarded a selection to John
Gould for his inspection. Included were specimens of what Gould describes as
" a new and very beautiful species of Parrakeet pertaining to the genus Poly teles, ..."
It is perhaps worth recalling Gould's naming of this species. He writes : " The
specific appellation I would propose for this novelty is alexandrae, in honour of that
Princess who, we may reasonably hope, is destined at some future time to be the
Queen of these realms and their dependencies, of which Australia is by no means
the most inconspicuous " (P.#.S., 1863, 232). Here Gould does not give a vernacular
name, but in his Handbook to the Birds of Australia, vol. ii, p. 32 (1865) and his Birds of

Who first changed the name to Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet cannot be determined
after this lapse of time. Possibly it was almost automatically adopted after the
accession. How has this species been called in Australian modern ornithological
literature ? It would seem that almost every possible variation has been used :

COLOUR CHANGE IN THE BEAKS OF YOUNG DERBYAN PARRAKEETS
I can confirm that the colour changes in the beaks of young Derbyans as described
by Mr. Rudkin (Avic. Mag., Nov.-Dee., 1953, p. 219), the reappearance of the

red in young males being first apparent on the lower mandible and gradually spreading
over the upper. The change was completed in those I have bred in 15-18 months.
There is, however, a slow and very gradual colour change in plumage which
commences earlier than the " beak change ", and I have found it possible to determine !
the sex from this change at a much earlier stage--certainly less than twelve months.
In the adult female there is a very distinct pale pink ring round the neck forming
a border to the grey hood. This ring is absent in the male at any age, but begins
to develop on the young hens with the partial moult, which occurs not long after
the birds leave the nest, and is followed by the appearance of a pink suffusion on
the upper breast feathers.
The appearance of these changes would, of course, depend to some extent on the
general development of the young birds, and would doubtless be delayed if they
were backward or ill-nourished.

RECORDS OF PARROTS BRED IN CAPTIVITY (ADDITIONS).
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992635" page_id="56238242"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
By Arthur A. Prestwich. London, 1954. Price ios. net.
This volume contains 121 additions to the records already published,
largely obtained by the author's careful search through various
Australian periodicals, notably Australian Aviculture and Bird World.
As Mr. Prestwich states in his preface, much of interest has come to
light as a result of this search, and thus made the Australian records
less incomplete. The present volume is a valuable addition to its
predecessors, and one that no aviculturist interested in Parrots should
be without.
The author makes an appeal for further information, particularly
relating to Germany to be embodied in " Further additions ", and it
is hoped all aviculturists will respond to this request to the best
of their ability.

THE OVERLOADED ARK. By Gerald M. Durrell. Faber
and Faber, Ltd., London, 1953. Price 15.L net.
The collection of wild animals rarely fails to arouse interest, and
this account of a six months' collecting trip to the little known British
Cameroons will appeal to a wide public. The author's main interest
was in mammals and reptiles, but he was accompanied by Mr. J. J.
Yealland, whose special concern is birds.
The greater part of the book deals with the capture of mammals
in the great rain forests in the neighbourhood of Eshobi, and subse-
quently with collecting around Bakebe where Mr. Yealland had made
his headquarters. The author gives a very entertaining account of his
various experiences with native hunters and the trials and disappoint-
ments of hand-rearing young animals and keeping alive a very assorted
collection with their different food requirements. The rare Angwan-
tibo, Arctocehus , the Black-legged Mongoose, and the curious Giant
Water Shrew, Potomogale, were among the more interesting captures,
but many visitors to the London Zoo will find a special appeal in the
story of the life and death of Cholmondeley, the famous chimpanzee
who, after being brought back from the Cameroons, twice escaped
from Regent's Park.
There are relatively few references to birds, but every aviculturist
will sympathize with the account of the heavy-footed hen foster parent,
who after successfully hatching a brood of Crested Guinea-fowl,
equally successfully exterminated them by walking over the young
chicks with complete unconcern and a bland expression on her face.

DIE UNZERTRENNLICHEN [LOVEBIRDS]. By Helmut
Hampe. Published by Verlag Gottfried Helene. Pfungstadt/
Darmstadt. 1953.
Helmut Hampe was a great aviculturist, and a great authority on
Parrakeets, particularly love-birds, or Agapornis, and a debt of gratitude
is due to Dr. J. Steinbacher for arranging the production of a second
edition of this book. Published in 1934, Die Unzertrennlichen was
immediately in great demand for it was a comprehensive and infor-
mative book and became out of print : hortly before the war. As
Dr. Steinbacher states in his preface to: he new edition, " Everything
that was known about Lovebirds is to be found in that book."
Helmut Hampe was wounded in the first world war, and during the
last ten years of his life, before his early death at the age of 42, in
!939, he had to remain in an invalid chair, but despite these draw-
backs he carried on his avicultural studies with an ardour and attention
to detail that has seldom been surpassed. His articles on his breeding
experiments with Red-faced Lovebirds and with Hooded Parrakeets

and on Brotogeris Parrakeets published in the Avicultural Magazine
in 1939, were outstanding, and the cessation of his valuable studies
was a severe loss to aviculture.
Die Unzertrennlichen opens with a chapter of general information
about Lovebirds in which the author explains how the Greek word
agapein = love, combined with ornis = bird, was given to these birds
by J. O. Selby in 1826, and how this was translated into the vernacular
name of Inseparable in French, Lovebird in English, and Unzertrennlich
== Inseparable, in German. A map showing the distribution is
included, together with a table of the points of similarity in coloration
of the six species and of the four races of personata. Detailed descrip-
tions of the birds then follow and the Latin, German, and English
names are given, with full information regarding breeding, rearing,
and behaviour of the birds in captivity.
In his preface, Dr. Steinbacher deplores the fact that it-has not
been possible to include all the illustrations which appeared in the
original book as these were destroyed during the war, but nevertheless
there are a number of most interesting photographs of various species.
Whilst the text is in German, all those who are interested in these
attractive birds will wish to possess this book, even without knowing
the language, and with a dictionary they will be able to obtain much
information of value.

(.Aratinga pertinax chrysophrys)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
Swainson (1837) was the first to describe this Parrakeet and give
it full specific status under the name Conurus chrysophrys. De Souance
(1856) also recognized it as a species, compared it with the Brown-
throated ( aeruginosa ) and the Cactus ( cactorum ) and figured it (1857),
giving it the vernacular name " Perruche des Cactus a joues brunes 55 .
Various other authors recognized it, but Salvadori (1891, 1906),
owing to limited material, considered there were only four species--
cactorum, aeruginosas, ocularis , and pertinax --in this group, regarding
chrysophrys as synonymous with aeruginous. Later (1912), having had
an opportunity of examining a large series of specimens, loaned by
the Hon. W. Rothschild, he admitted eight species--*" C. cactorum,
from S.E. Brazil, C. xanthogenius, from Bonaire, C. pertinax, from
Curasao and Saint Thomas, C. ocularis, from Panama, C. aeruginosas,
from British Guiana and Venezuela, C. aruhensis, from Aruba,
C. tortugensis, from Tortuga Island, and C. chrysophrys, from Colombia. 55
Peters (1937) has rearranged this group, and recognizes eight

Peters gives the habitat of chrysophrys as British Guiana, Surinam,

bird is, however, the true aeruginosa.
Nothing appears to have been written about the life of this Conure
in the wild state : and until the recent importations of the so-called
" St. Thomas's " it was unknown to English aviculture--at least there
are no records of its arrival in this country.

The Diamond Jubilee of the Avicultural Society was celebrated
by an Avicultural Conference held in London from ^th-ipth June,
1954. The meetings were held in the Meeting Room of the Zoological
Society of London, Regent's Park, London, N.W. i, by kind permission
of the Council.
In opening the proceedings at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17th June,
1954, the President of the Conference, Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith,
said that the Diamond Jubilee was a most important occasion in the
history of the Society. At the time of the 50th Anniversary the only
means of marking that important milestone in the Society's history
had been by the publication of a Jubilee Supplement of the Avi-
cultural Magazine. In that Supplement it had been stated that
in the ordinary course of events the attainment of the Avicultural
Society's 50th Anniversary would have been celebrated with due
festivity--scientific and social ; it had been the Hon. Secretaries'
happy idea to celebrate the 60th Anniversary with the scientific and
social activity which had not been possible ten years ago, in the middle
of a world war. It was most encouraging that so many members of
the Society and guests had travelled, some of them very great distances,
from different countries to take part in these celebrations, and they
were warmly welcome.
The Avicultural Society was founded in October, 1894, when there
were 52 members, to-day they numbered 982, and perhaps at the end

of this Jubilee year they might reach the thousand mark. In the
early days of the Society the membership had been chiefly concen-
trated round Brighton, where the Hon. Secretary, Dr. C. S. Simpson,
lived, but now there were members in Africa, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Ceylon, Denmark, Dutch Guiana, Fin-
land, France, Germany, Holland, Hongkong, Hawaii, Iceland, Italy,
India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Sarawak,
United States, and the West Indies. Though none of the founder
members were still living, she was particularly glad that Mr. Seth-
Smith, who joined the Society in December, 1894, and therefore only
missed being a founder member by two months, was here to-day.
Mr. Seth-Smith had always played a leading part in the affairs of the
Society, and rendered great service both to it and to aviculture, par-
ticularly during the time when he had edited the Avicultural
Magazine.
The Society had only had four Presidents, the first the Countess
of Bective had been President for one year, she was followed by the
Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton who was President from 1896 to
1920, being succeeded by Mr. H. D. Astley in 1921, who remained
in office till 1925. Since 1926 Mr. Alfred Ezra had been President
and under his wise guidance the society had grown and prospered---
he had been President for nearly thirty years, and the Council had
decided that the Diamond Jubilee celebrations would be a suitable
occasion on which to present the President with a small token of the
esteem and affection in which he was held. Miss Barclay-Smith then
presented Mr. Ezra with an illuminated scroll, and read to the meeting
the wording upon it :--
" Presented to Alfred Ezra, O.B.E., President of the Avicultural
Society on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the Society by
the Members of the Council as a token of their affection and
appreciation of his many years of office and notable contributions
to Aviculture."
The scroll, painted by Mr. D. M. Reid-Henry, contained vignettes
of Pink-headed Duck, Crowned Crane, Humming Bird, and blue
Alexandrine Parrakeet--symbolic of Mr. Ezra's main avicultural
interests.
Miss Barclay-Smith formally declared the Conference open, and
then gave details of the letters and telegrams of congratulations and
good wishes which had been received from members throughout the
world, as follows :--

THE FOUNDATION AND EARLY DAYS OF THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY
"The Avicultural Society may be said to have commenced its life
in Brighton in 1894, thanks mainly to two gentlemen, interested in
the keeping and breeding of foreign birds, Dr. G. S. Simpson, a
medical practitioner, and Mr. Horatio R. Fillmer, a solicitor. But

these were supported by several others. There was Mr. Reginald
Phillipps, a retired Civil Servant and very experienced aviculturist,
living in London ; Dr. Arthur G. Butler, of the Entomological
Department of the British Museum, who lived at Beckenham ;
Mr. J. B. Housden, a retired business man, living at Sydenham ;
the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton, of Bibury Rectory, and Mr. H. T. T.
Camps, the two chief authorities of their day on Parrots. And
there was Mr. John Frostick, who most of those present will remember
to have met at the great bird shows, and Mr. W. H. St. Quintin, who
I shall mention again later. The first President was the Countess
of Bective.
Dr. Simpson was Honorary Secretary, and Mr. Fillmer Treasurer,
and these two together edited the Magazine. The printers and
publishers were Messrs. W. T. Moulton, of Brighton, and they served
the Society very well for many years.
It was considered desirable to invent a name to denote c a person
interested in the keeping and breeding of birds \ Such persons had
previously been known as ' Bird Fanciers ', a term which included
those who kept any kind of bird, domestic or otherwise. The term
' Aviculturist 5 being analogous to 4 Horticulturist ', seemed to fill the
bill, and we read, c Unless any one will suggest a better name we
beg to subscribe ourselves " Aviculturists " '.
There were several societies connected with birds and bird-keeping
which existed for the purpose of holding meetings to discuss their
problems, but there was also a large number of persons scattered
about the country, though too far separated to meet often. It was
therefore felt that a magazine managed by experts on the subject
who would be prepared to advise members both in print and by
means of the post, would be a great help. So it was decided to start
the first number of what was to be called the ' Avicultural
Magazine 5 , although with a membership of only 52, but the funds
for the first year were generously guaranteed by Mr. Fillmer. He
wrote that the Society must be self-supporting after October, 1895,
and he would not be satisfied until the membership was up to 200.
Queries were answered by what was then the penny post, and the
more interesting of these published with the answers in the Magazine.
The object of the Society was the study of Foreign and British
Birds ; poultry, pigeons, and Canaries being outside its scope. The
subscription for the first year was five shillings with an entrance fee
of two-and-sixpence, but in 1899 this had to be raised to seven shillings
and sixpence, and in 1900 to ten shillings. Even this was cheap
enough, considering the Magazine was published every month.
Although the holding of shows was never an object of the Society
and not encouraged, reports of the more important of these were
regularly published in the Magazine, and very good reports they

generally were, written by such authorities as Reginald Phillipps,
H. R. Fillmer, C. S. Simpson, and others.
By the end of its second year the membership had increased to 173,
and included such names as J. L. Bonhote, O. E. Cresswell, Rev. C. D.
Farrar, Frank Finn, E. G. B. Meade-Waldo and W. Swaysland.
At the end of his second year of Secretaryship, Dr. Simpson found
the time occupied by his medical work made it impossible for him
to continue and relinquished the post. He had successfully seen
the Society through its teething troubles, and now handed it over
to his friend and colleague, H. R. Fillmer, who also became Editor
of the Magazine. He certainly carried out the work well, and to him
must go most of the credit of having made the Society.
Volume III (Nov., 1896-Oct., 1897) was considerably enlarged,
the number of members having risen to well over the 200 mark, and
four coloured plates from original drawings by F. W. Frohawk were
issued. These were hand-coloured, a very usual process in coloured
illustrations of birds in those days. And there were two very nice
drawings, in monochrome, by H. D. Astley.
From now on the Magazine went ahead, increasing in size with every
volume, and the quality of the articles and illustrations was excellent.
In 1899, Mr. Fillmer resigned from his post of Honorary Secretary,
for which most at least of the members were very sorry as he had done
so much for the Society. He had put forward a plan for the enlarge-
ment of the scope of the Magazine by including domestic birds such
as canaries, but his proposal met with very strong opposition and no
support, which apparently distressed him considerably. Many years
later he was made an Honorary Member and Vice-President of the
Society.
And now a few words about some of the principal aviculturists of
those days, most of whom I could claim as valued friends.
I think the first I met, and it was in November, 1894, was J. B.
Housden, who lived in Sydenham. He possessed some large aviaries,
and used to breed a number of Australian Crested Doves, a species
I was greatly taken with at the time, as well as some of the Australian
parrakeets, while in a small aviary in one corner I well remember a
very fine pair of Great Eagle-Owls with two young almost as large
as themselves. After showing me his birds, Mr. Housden took from
his pocket what looked like a small pamphlet which he said he thought
would interest me, as it was the first number of a new publication
called the Avicultural Magazine, published by a new Society he
thought I might like to join. I was much interested, and asked him
to propose me as a member, which he did, though I just missed being
actually an Original Member.
Housden lived almost outside the gates of the Crystal Palace where,
at the great shows held there, he won many prizes for his birds.

Not far from him lived Dr. A. G. Butler, who was on the staff of
the Natural History Museum, though in the Entomological Depart-
ment. His hobby was aviculture, and he kept a fairly large number
of foreign birds in cages and loose in a bird room, though later he
built a large open-air aviary in his garden. His book, Foreign Finches
in Captivity, illustrated by Frohawk, is now long out of print, but he
wrote several other books and many articles in the Magazine.
Reginald Phillipps, at the time an elderly, white-bearded and
charming man, lived in a small house in the Hammersmith district,
and it was always a pleasure to visit him and his very charming wife,
as he was very keen and knowledgeable on all matters avicultural.
He kept a large number of foreign birds, mostly rare species, and was
very successful in breeding them. His back garden was not very
large, but the whole of it was completely wired over, the garden walls
forming the sides of the aviary which was divided into two parts,
the further half grown into a dense jungle. The half nearest to the
house was connected with one of the rooms, probably originally the
drawing-room, now forming the covered part of the aviary. It contained
also several cages where new arrivals would rest until considered fit
to be let out. Amongst his outstanding successes were the breeding
of the Australian Blue Wren and Regent Bower Bird, neither of
which had been bred elsewhere in captivity.
Phillipps was a very fruitful contributor to the Magazine, his articles
being complete and explicit in every detail. He later took over the
Secretaryship of the Society.
On the retirement of Fillmer from the Secretaryship in 1899, the
post was taken by J. L. Bonhote, while O. E. Cresswell became Editor.
Bonhote when he joined the Society soon after its foundation, was
an undergraduate at Cambridge and a student of Professor Alfred
Newton from whom he, no doubt, acquired much of his keenness for
British birds. He later kept many, especially concentrating upon
waterfowl, in the hybridizing of which he obtained much valuable
information as to their affinity towards one another. He wrote a very
good book on British birds.
O. E. Cresswell, of Morney Cross, Hereford, specialized chiefly in
foreign doves and parrakeets, though keeping many other birds as well.
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo and W. H. St. Quintin were, I think, cousins,
the one living at one time in Hampshire, later at his family seat,
Stonewall Park, Edenbridge, the other at Scampston Hall, York-
shire. Both were excellent all-round naturalists as well as keen
aviculturists. Meade-Waldo kept rather unusual birds such as Sand
Grouse, Trumpeter Bullfinches, and Teydean Chaffinches, which he
had himself captured in his travels in North Africa and the Canary
Islands ; and he kept also a number of owls of various kinds as well
as other predatory birds. He introduced Mandarin Ducks to some

ponds in his woods where they bred and increased as wild birds ;
and he was partly responsible for the introduction of the Little Owl,
and showed me with much pride a nest of young in an apple tree
stump in his orchard.
St. Quintin kept in his park a large collection of rare waterfowl,
Great Bustards, and Cranes, as well as, in large aviaries, Ravens,
Little Bustards, and Waxwings, while under more protection there
were the smaller foreigners, Gouldians, Parrot Finches, and Painted
Quails. These two naturalists were fast friends, keeping careful diaries
of all country happenings, and exchanging their experiences by almost
daily correspondence. I wish their diaries could have been published
as they would have been worthy successors to that of Gilbert White.
The Rev. C. D. Farrar was Vicar of Micklefield, in Yorkshire, and
possessed a very large garden aviary in which he seems to have bred
almost everything he tried, and he managed to winter even the smallest
successfully without artificial warmth. He was a prolific writer, but
his articles often led to heated controversies, to the distraction of the
Editor. When I was Editor later on, I had trouble with Mr. Farrar, and
he wrote asking if he might call and see me, to which I readily agreed.
From his previous writing one might have thought that this burly
Yorkshireman, standing over six feet tall, might be quite dangerous,
but, on the contrary, he was as gentle as a lamb and, in fact, quite
charming. We parted the best of friends.
Then there was Frank Finn, at that time Deputy Superintendent of
the Indian Museum at Calcutta, a man with a great knowledge of
birds in general and Indian birds in particular. He wrote several
books on birds, and possessed the most remarkable memory. And I
must not forget Miss Rosie Alderson, an authority on foreign doves,
who helped much in those early days of the Society.
Such is a brief outline of the foundation and early years of the
Society. The last years of the nineteenth century. Fifty-four years
ago. There were certainly some excellent aviculturists in those years,
perhaps more who actually kept birds in any numbers than now, but
I think there are probably more now who are interested in birds, even
if they are too busy to keep them. In those days the Society held no
meetings, not even of the Council, so it was difficult for the members
to get to know one another. Now the Society holds regular meetings
of Council, and we have the Aviculturists' Club which is a wonderful
means of bringing the members together, as well as adding to their
numbers."

ban on importation imposed in 1930. The raising, for nearly a year,
of this embargo in 1953, permitted the influx of a number of Asiatic,
South American and African species, but very few Australians came in.
The least said about the manner in which these birds were imported
the better. Thus, apart from these importations, the maj&amp;apos;ority of the
birds in our aviaries and zoological collections originate from well
established home-bred stock. In all there are at least a hundred and
fifty species or more represented, of which I have been able to obtain
coloured photographs of a hundred or so and now propose to show
you a selection from these.
Following Peters' Classification, of the six Sub-families of Parrots,
three can be dealt with instantly, as we have only one representative,
namely the Kea of the second Sub-family, the Nestors. The first,
the Owl Parrots or Strigopinae are no longer in the country, and the
third, the Pygmy Parrots or Micropsittinae, have never reached our
shores alive : I believe the nearest success was by Goodfellow as long-
ago as 1908. Returning to the Kea, a specimen is exhibited in the
London Zoo, and of course, Mr. Sidney Porter, who made avicultural
history by breeding these birds in 1947, still has some of them, and I
believe is still hopeful of repeating his success. He is most emphatic
that these are most intelligent and endearing birds, in spite of all that
has been attributed to them.
The Loriinae, which scientifically should be between the Nestors
and the Pygmy Parrots, are mostly only found as single birds, or at
least without any real breeding facilities. This picture is of a
Chattering Lory, but there are also several Purple-capped, Black-
capped, Black, Yellow-backed, Violet-necked, and possibly others.
Among the Lorikeets are Swainson's and Forsten's, both of which
have potentialities as breeders. Also there are Red-collared, Ornate
and Scaly-breasted pairs. At Whipsnade is an exhibit labelled Green-
naped, but I believe this is really Mitchell's or Edwards's. Well known,
too, on the show bench are a pair of rare Musschenbroek's which
were once in the Duke of Bedford's collection, but apparently
unsatisfactory as breeders.
The next sub-family of Cockatoos is well represented, although few
are accorded breeding conditions. The first picture is of a Banksian
cock who has a hen in the Parrot House, but no aviary and nest
box to try with. There are also examples of the Palm Cockatoo,
Funereal or Yellow-tailed Black, and in the Coronation Collection
are a pair of Baudin's or White-tailed Black Cockatoos which have
only been in this country once before, about forty years ago, and a
point should be made to see these birds whilst here.
There are at least two pairs of Gang-Gangs which are regular
breeders. I believe Mrs. Clark has two pairs now. There are several
Roseates, the picture shows an albino hen and her normal mate,

taken last year at Woburn. There are also a number of these in the
Coronation Collection.
Among the white Cockatoos we have specimens of the Moluccan,
or Salmon-crested, Triton, Blue-eyed, Slender-billed, and Bare-eyed ;
there is at least one true pair of Great White Cockatoos belonging to
Pat Maxwell at Whipsnade, but their skill and ability as wire cutters
make them a difficult subject to be kept in large breeding quarters.
There are many Sulphur-crests of the Greater, Lesser, and a few of
the Timor species, but few people can provide the space or a sufficiently
strong aviary to permit breeding ; some however do. There are quite a
few good breeding pairs of Leadbeater's which is probably the loveliest
of them all. During the relaxation of the ban some Citron-crested or
Orange-crested pairs were imported, and efforts are being made to
induce these to breed. Of the smaller species we have some Goffin's
and Ducorp's, but so far as I know none of these are potential breeding
pairs.
The prolific Cockatiel has maintained its numbers by being bred
in aviaries for generations. Our established stock compared very
favourably with the few imported specimens I saw.
Macaws again are large birds which few can accommodate in
strong breeding quarters, and most specimens are zoological exhibits,
such as the Scarlet or Red and Yellow, the Greenwing or Red and
Blue, Blue and Yellow, Hyacinthine, Lear's. Attempts are made
annually to rear some of these birds, but success is seldom attained ;
it is peculiar that whenever a large Macaw does succeed, it is nearly
always a hybrid youngster. Apart from the birds illustrated, we have
specimens also of Military, Severe, and Spix. Among the smaller
species there are pairs of Illiger's and Nobles which are being given
breeding opportunities. My own Nobles have bred every year since
their initial effort, and there must be a number of potential breeders
about.
The position over Conures is rather indefinite. With the exception
of Mrs. Clark's Queen of Bavaria's, breeding stocks as such are still
non-existent. A number were imported, but seem to have almost
disappeared without gaining any footing. Although there are a
number of old specimens still surviving in zoos such as Blue-crowned,
Red-masked, Black-masked, etc., a few of the latter were imported
along with some Jendayas, Half-moon or Golden-crowned. Then
a number of St. Thomas were imported which were in fact not the rare
species from that island, but the Yellow-cheeked from Guiana. These
have not been bred, but efforts are being made to start them. There
are also a few Cactus and related species. A few of the delightful
little Pyrrhura Conures were also sent over, and it will be a great
misfortune if we cannot establish the Red-bellied and White-eared.

young last year, and in my own aviaries last year the latter hatched
two young, which died when about five weeks old, and were still
rather under-developed. This year they have also been disturbed
by uninvited visitors, but they are trying again.
The few Patagonian Conures seem to have been unfortunate, and
one definite pair at Whipsnade made a neat little hole in the roof of
their flight and were never seen or heard of again. Possibly only
two or three pairs are left, and so far they have not been reared.
I have no photograph yet of the Lineolated Parrakeet bred last
season for the first time by Mr. Prestwich, who now has a small stud
of these delightful little birds and hopes to repeat his success.
Three species of Parrotlet were imported, the Blue-wing, Guiana
and the Turquoise-rumped. These birds do not breed readily here,
and we have never been able to start strains such as Mr. Enehjelm
has done in Finland. A few pairs actually reared families, but there
seems little likelihood of strains being firmly founded. The cock
illustrated nested twice indoors with a hen in my aviaries, but no
young were hatched, and the hen died on eggs before she was turned
out into an outdoor flight as originally intended.
The Brotogerys genus came over in quite good numbers, par-
ticularly Canary-wings. Odd White-wings and All Green turned up,
and one consignment contained four Gold-wings which are probably
the first and only importation of these birds into England. Mr. Prest-
wich is trying out these birds this year.
Pionus Parrots were also among the birds brought over as single
specimens, and included Maximilian's, Red-vented, Sordid, but none
of them took kindly to captivity, and few are still living. The only
record of these birds breeding here is of the White-capped hand-reared
by Mr. Yealland some years ago.
Amazon Parrots also arrived, but so far only the Blue-fronted have
been bred and a hybrid Blue-front X Yellow-cheek. Breeding pairs
(potential) are at present being kept in Blue-fronts, Yellow-cheek,
Cuban and Yellow-fronts. There are several odd specimens of other
species kept as pets which might one day be bred from. There are,
for instance, several Orange-winged, Salvins, Salles, Red-topped,
Green-cheeked, Festive, Mealy, to name a few.
Of the delightful little Caiques, pairs of both White-bellied and
Black-headed came in. Whether these will eventually breed is of
course highly speculative, but they are being given the chance to do
so, as also are a pair of Hawk-headed.
From Africa we have a number of Senegal Parrots, including
one or two of the Red-bellied variety. In the Zoo is a very nice

possibly the only one ever imported. The Meyer's and RuppelFs are
also represented in zoos.
Although there are many African Greys, probably there are less
than a half dozen pairs from which serious attempts are being made
to breed. Of course a few Timneh are also here, although their fond
owners are possibly quite unaware that it is any different to the
hundreds of other Greys.
At Whipsnade, Pat Maxwell has kept the only specimen of Pes^uet's
Parrot in good health and condition for nearly two years. Quite a
friendly bird if unusual.
There is at least one pair of Red-sided Eclectus which gained for
Mr. Indge the medal last year for being a first breeding. These birds
have now changed ownership, but I understand they are still trying
to breed again. I was only able to get the hen to pose for me.
The Asiatic Psittacula are well represented, mostly with well
established breeding strains in the Ringneck of which I have only one
photo of the normal bird, a hen, here shown with a lutino cock.
A better illustration of the lutino cock follows. Then there are the
blue birds which the late Duke had gone far to establishing. This
pair are still immature, being only two years old, but the following
illustration is of an adult cock taken last year at Woburn. Here I
was also able to get a picture of a yellow plumhead cock, not a lutino,
although there is one of these at Keston. There are quite a number
of possible breeders, although they are not very reliable regularly in
this direction.
My own success with the Moustache last year has unhappily
not been repeated. Experience has proved they are exceedingly
prone to pneumonia and the original pair have died. Others are still
trying to breed from good pairs, however. There are also a few
Alexandrine's and Layard's, and at least one Long-tailed and a hen
Malabar. One or two pairs of Derbyans, too.
Princess of Wales' are well established, and we were able to
reinforce our stock with a few imported specimens. Only a few pairs
of Rock Peplars and Barraband's are still here, but at least some of
these breed regularly.
We still have a few pairs of Crimson-wings, and there are two cocks
at least of the Timor Island variety, this one is in the Zoo here.
I believe there are only two pairs of the lovely Green-wing Kings *
left. One breeds fairly regularly at the Zoo, and our President has
a pair : my own died over a year ago of old age. Most of the Kings
are old birds, but again we were able to get a few of these magnificent
birds over recently.
* On the visit to Foxwarren on Saturday, 19th June, we were able to see two pairs
of Green-wing Kings at the President's Garden Party, one of which had two youngsters
on the point of fledging.

There are two of the Malay Blue-rumped Parrots in the country,
unfortunately both are males. This bird seldom is imported, and
appears to be difficult to acclimatize yet easy to keep once accustomed
to captivity.
The Lovebirds ought to be safely established considering the
numbers of Fischer's and Masked that were brought in. I wonder if
they are. The Red-faced, of course, has not yet been bred in captivity
in spite of near successes. This is a colony of some thirty birds with
which Mr. Prestwich is trying to accomplish this difficult task. There
are not a lot of Peach-faced, but several pairs are now rearing
regularly. Several Fischer's have been bred, but not as many as
should have been, when one considers the numbers that came in.
The same remark applies to Masked, and we now have quite a few of
the blue variety, although these do not appear to relish this climate,
and who can blame them after this year's effort at summer. The
Duke had a few Nyasas, including a luting cock. Only green birds
have been reared so far here, but we are still trying. A few Abyssinian
pairs exist, there are no Madagascars or Black-cheek. Swindern's have
never been imported.
The Hanging Parrots are not very popular as aviary subj&amp;apos;ects. The
Vernal came in in quite considerable numbers, but were not good
sellers, and the dealers soon dropped them, besides which they are
not likely to breed. The lovely little Blue-crowned also reached us,
but only cocks.
This brings us to the Australian Broadtails, which have been well
established as home bred stock for many years. Fresh blood has been
acquired recently, and we have pretty good stocks. Unfortunately,
when the ban was lifted, I concentrated on the rarer species, and
disposed of many of my old Rosellas, now difficult to replace with
birds of the same reliable standard. However, we have several fine
Pennant's, Golden-mantles, Stanley's, and Mealies. Brown's
are rare, and seldom reliable breeders. There are also one or two
pairs of Bauer's and several good Barnard's.
The Red-capped or Pileated Parrot, called Western King in
Australia, seems to be on the way to developing a strain at Keston,
one pair having reared almost twenty young. Others are now trying
their hand with this lovely bird.
Blue-bonnets are almost non-existent now. I had a pair of Yellow-
vented, but the hen died soon after importation, and these two
Narethas from the Duke's collection are both hens and probably
the only ones ever imported.
The Red-rumps are pretty well established, and many good birds
are reared annually. The yellow variety does not seem to be doing so
well lately. Many-colours breed fairly well here, and again their

blood has been reinforced. There is a pair of Hooded, but unfortu-
nately they are not together.
Of the Grass Parrakeets, Bourkes have been well established for
years. These also have had a few newly imported specimens. Elegants
are also well established with a limited number of breeders. Turquoi-
sines have been re-established, and given reasonable good fortune
these should be on the increase soon. The same applies to Splendids,
although I would like to see more of these birds in the country, as our
stocks are exceedingly low.
That I think records the position of the Parrot-like birds in England
to-day, and it goes without saying that the Budgerigar, the last
of the family to be mentioned, will most probably manage to hold
its own as an aviary bred species ! "

" At the invitation of the Board of Commissioners of Agriculture and
Forestry of the Territory of Hawaii, the Wildfowl Trust agreed to
take an active part in the attempt to save the Ne-ne or Hawaiian
Goose, Branta sandvicencis , from imminent extinction. In 1951, only
thirty-two individuals were known to be surviving. Up to this time
the Hawaiian Goose in the wild state had occurred, so far as is known,
only on the island of Hawaii, with the exception of a few isolated records
on neighbouring islands. Less than a century ago 25,000 of these birds
are believed to have existed, and the diminution is thought to be due to
several causes, besides their destruction by the islanders for food, during
the flightless moulting period. In addition to feral cats, dogs, and pigs,
the mongoose, which was introduced to kill the rats that were damaging
the sugar cane, helped to decrease the numbers of all ground nesting
birds by destroying nests, eggs, and young. The few remaining geese
which are still in the wild state have been seen on the slopes of the
13,700 feet volcano Mauna Loa and its neighbour Hualalai. These
lava slopes are in general character a kind of moorland--moss and
lichen covered rocks, a few trees, various grasses and other plants,
some of them bearing berries which are eaten by the geese, a favourite
being the Ohelo --Vaccinium reticulatum. Here and there the lava is
impervious enough to hold water, so that there are some shallow pools,
but no large areas of water.
In 1950 the Trust sent its Curator, Mr. John Yealland, to Hawaii
in order to advise and assist in the establishment of a breeding station
for propagating Ne-nes at Pohakuloa in Hawaii. Mr. Yealland

successfully raised a brood. On his return to England he brought
a couple of Ne-nes as a gift from Mr. Herbert Shipman, of Hilo,
to whose interest the species owes its existence to-day. Both of these
laid eggs in March, 1951. A gander was at once flown from Hawaii,
and during the breeding season of 1952, nine young Ne-ne goslings
hatched, all of which survived. In the same year three were raised
at Pohakuloa, and the total number of birds known to exist was
forty-six. In 1953 a further four goslings hatched at Slimbridge,
and were successfully reared. This year, 1954, five goslings hatched,
but only four have survived. Unfortunately one adult died, and
two young birds which were lent to another breeder were poisoned
by a disastrous accident, so the present total at the Wildfowl Trust
is seventeen, a quarter of the world population of these birds, which
is at present believed to be sixty-eight.
THE HIGH ANDES
(.Illustrated by colour film)
Early in 1953, my wife and I made an ornithological expedition
to South America. The first part of it was spent in the extreme south
of Chile and the Argentine--the southern tip of Patagonia, and the
island of Tierra del Fuego. The second half was spent on the Andean
Plateau of Bolivia, not far south of the equator. Before leaving Buenos
Aires we were able, in the nearby marshes, to study and film that
obscure but interesting bird the Black-headed Duck, Heteronetta
atricapilla , which is parasitic, laying its eggs in the nests of Coots,
Night Herons, and Ibises. From Argentina we flew up into Bolivia,
whose capital La Paz is 13,000 feet above sea-level, and from here we
went by rail past the famous pre-Inca ruins of Tiahuanaco, to the
port of Guaqui on Lake Titicaca.
The bird life of this lake is especially rich and interesting, because
many of the forms are confined to the puna district or altiplano , although
closely related to lowland species. These subspecies tend to be
larger than their counterparts. The commonest ducks on the lake
are the Puna Teal, the Sharp-winged Teal, and the Peruvian Stifftail.
We also saw the Giant Coot, many Grebes, Cormorants, Night Herons,
and waders, including Wilson's Phalarope on migration from North
America. Some of the ducks were moulting and flightless, and we
were able to catch a small number of Puna Teal and Sharp wings
from a boat by dipping them out of the clear water with a home-made
net when they dived. These birds are now established in the Trust's
enclosures in Gloucestershire, and the Sharpwings have nested.
The main objective of this journey in Bolivia, however, was to see
the beautiful Torrent Duck, Merganetta armata , which lives in the
waterfalls of the Andean streams. For this purpose we travelled
over a high pass near the great mountain Huaina Potosi (where on

a lake at 16,000 feet we saw a flock of Andean Geese), and down into
the Valley of the Zongo, which finally drains into the Amazon.
This valley is accessible because of a hydro-electric scheme, and it
was in the River Zongo that we finally came upon a group of five
Bolivian Torrent Ducks, M. armata garleppi. Although they could
not be filmed at very close range, their behaviour was carefully studied,
and hitherto unrecorded details of display and voice were noted.
The films show the swimming capacities of these birds in the white
water of the torrents, and some features of the display. They are
believed to be the first colour films ever taken of this little known
and fascinating bird."

" In this very short lecture I intend to give you a general idea of how
Bird Protection has developed in Belgium in the last few years.
But allow me first of all to thank you for your kind invitation to
address the Avicultural Society on the occasion of its Diamond
Jubilee. Please do not consider it as a mere complimentary phrase,
when I tell you that your invitation made me feel very much flattered.
I am glad to be here among friends who are in full support of an
ideal, for which we still have to fight the first battle in my country.
The celebration by your Avicultural Society of an imposing Diamond
Jubilee proves that the subject of Bird Protection is not new in Britain.
In Belgium it is only a growing idea and a very topical question at
this very moment. This is the reason why I have chosen ' Bird
Protection in Belgium 5 as subject for the speech I was asked to
deliver here.
On Sunday, 13th July, just a few days ago, the 4 Belgian Society
for Bird Sanctuaries 5 inaugurated its very first bird sanctuary.
This took place with a certain solemnity in the presence of repre-
sentatives of several Ministers, the Lord-Lieutenant, many prominent
people, and an attendance of more than one thousand enthusiasts.
This was the second year that the 4 Union of Societies for Nature
Conservation 5 succeeded in organizing what we call 4 The National
Nature Conservation Day ', and we were glad to be able to offer the
public a new nature reserve rather than words and speeches.
Members of the Press and of broadcast and the film journals were
present, and have helped enormously in the promotion of nature
reserves all over the country.
An intensive propaganda campaign has been launched during these
last months. We cherish the hope that this will improve public
opinion and will result in a better protection of nature, a protection
of the animal habitats, and an increase of bird sanctuaries.

I expect you are wondering at the excitement in Belgium over so
simple a thing as the very first small bird sanctuary, purchased by
a Society.
I have a map of Britain, nicely dotted to mark the numerous and
well managed bird sanctuaries, and I know we are shamefully behind
in Belgium. This explains the stir over the event.
The idea of ' bird protection 5 has been successfully realized in
your country for many years, and whenever a new bird sanctuary
is added to your long list, it is quite a normal thing, a familiar event
of little account !
However, conditions are quite different in Belgium, and it may
be of some interest to you to sketch in rough outline the struggle for
nature conservation in Belgium. First I will try to show you what
the situation was three years ago, when the Belgian Society for Bird
Sanctuaries was founded ; next I will do my best to give you an idea
of the present state of affairs and a glimpse of our prospects for the
near future.
There has always been a great number of ornithologists all over
Belgium : amateurs, bird watchers, semi-scientific workers, reporting
upon migration and nesting, and ringing birds. Some of them
co-operated with the Royal Institute of Natural History, others with
our bird journals, De Wielewaal and Le Gerfaut , two publications that
are evidence of their enthusiasm. There were also a considerable
number of unambitious individual bird-watchers for whom wild
bird life was just a thing of interest and who never decided to tackle a
special problem.
These ornithologists recorded a steady decrease in both number
and variety of many Belgian birds, and noticed the disappearance
of several species from our country. They constantly called public
attention to the urgent necessity of improving the actual Bird Pro-
tection Acts, and of supporting the conservation of wild animals and
plants by protecting the very last natural wood-, marsh-, moor-, and
coastland in our overpopulated land.
On the other hand, bird-catching has always been a deplorable
hobby of the lower classes in Belgium, and too many politicians, who
stick to their mandate, are afraid of alienating their electors by voting
any new Bird Protection Bill.
Not one of our successive governments ever made a serious attempt
to vote any funds for nature conservation nor for the protection of wild
plants and animals in their natural habitat, and owners of natural
landscapes can still spoil them as much as they like, for there is no
act to put a stop to such vandalism.
In the meantime private societies for the protection of nature and
monuments were created, and did their utmost to call attention
to the urgent necessity for action, but they were voices crying in the
io

wilderness. Local authorities and ministers pretended to listen kindly
and attentively, promised to do their utmost, but never took any action.
The government never considered the purchase of nature reserves.
Eventually these societies came to the conclusion that there remained
only one, but rather expensive, solution : to try to collect the money
and purchase the menaced natural landscapes !
These societies for protection of nature deserve our warmest grati-
tude. Their sphere of action, however, is very large, and moreover
they are so much pressed for money that they have had to limit their
activities. They really did their very best to promote nature protection,
but it only resulted in unsuccessful protests in the papers and in
government circles.
The International Congress of Ornithology of 1950, in Upsala,
indirectly brought a change for the better in this sad situation. Those
Belgian ornithologists present suggested the foundation of a special
society for the protection of nature, which would concentrate all
activities on bird protection.
Architect Jan Jacobs actively pushed on the work, and he was
assisted by Leon Lippens, an all-round experienced man, a first-rate
ornithologist and a man whose voice carries weight. In 1951 the
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.632697" genericHeader="categories and subject descriptors" page_id="56238270" page_num="118" year="" vol="">
4 Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries 5 was founded. Through the
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997951166666667" page_id="56238270"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
kind offices of Dr. Rene Verheyen, the Society was invited by Dr. Van
Straelen, president of the National Parks in the Belgian Congo, to
establish the seat of the young society under the same roof.
This brought a sudden rise in prestige. A few weeks later,
H.M. Queen Elisabeth of Belgium granted her high protection to
the Society. Her Majesty invited Dr. Koch, who is well known in
Britain, to make gramophone records of the bird-song in the Royal
Park of Laeken, near Brussels. A copy of this beautiful collection
of records, accompanied by a well illustrated handbook, has been
sent by Her Majesty to many schools, and the remaining records are
sold for the profit of a charitable institution.
So the new society started with good prospects and high hopes.
It may be of some interest to relate the experience gained since 1951
and the results obtained.
Three years ago the Society still laboured under the delusion that
a nice pamphlet could do wonders, that it would be able to draw
government attention upon the shameful state of affairs, that print
could awake public opinion, and that automatically thousands of
enthusiasts would join and pay a small contribution to defray the
costs of administration.
The pamphlet looked nice. It was a cry of alarm from end to end,
and especially drew attention to the fact:--
--that in the moorlands : Ruff, Tawny Pipit, Black Grouse, Curlew,
and Bar-tailed Godwit were getting very rare ;

<bodyText confidence="0.997450153846154" page_id="56238271"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
--that in the polderlands, along the low rivers : Black-winged Stilt,
Avocet, and Oyster-catcher were becoming scarce ;
--that in the marshes : the Bittern, and the Little Bittern were in
danger;
---and that along the sea shore : Plovers and Little Terns had already
disappeared.
Twenty thousand of these pamphlets were distributed throughout
the country in 1951. They were sent to friends, teachers, doctors,
lawyers, readers of ornithological journals, etc. The result was
disheartening. Public opinion was not ripe, and the total amount
of subscriptions collected hardly paid the expenses of printing and
postal charges !
In the meantime we grew aware of the fact that the little group of
active members did not increase. Six people had to carry the load,
and among the members not even a seventh bird-lover could be
found to spare time to help the Society by practical co-operation.
At this very critical moment the Society by chance secured the
valuable help of Mr. Herberigs, a very active ornithologist, who is at
present the delegate of the Society. He was not afraid of paying an
endless number of annoying visits to people all over the country who
might possibly join. These interviews proved to be a success, and in
1952 a change to another method of collecting subscriptions was made.
Instead of trying to gain a vast number of ordinary members, efforts
were concentrated upon securing an increase of protecting members,
who pay annually 1,000 F. and up.
This new method succeeded wonderfully with the help of
Mr. Herberigs' persuasive power, and soon a considerable number
of protecting members joined.
About that time circumstances were such as to be favourable to
the idea of nature reserves ; one of those psychological moments
which are very difficult to explain, but which could be expected just
then, as the papers had done their very utmost to support and push
the idea. The leading part was taken in the country by the 4 Friends
of the River Ourthe ' who tried to prevent the construction of a
barrage, that would spoil the most beautiful valley of the Ardennes
(a battle, which I regret to say, they lost !)--by 4 The Friends of the
Foret de Soignes, south of Brussels, through which the government
planned to build an autostrade or main motor-road--by Mr. Leon

public became interested in the question as a result of all the publicity
that had been given.
I do not know how politicians behave in Britain, but the leaders
of the people in Belgium often prefer to follow the track of their voters
instead of guiding them. But as things are at present, politicians can no
longer ignore such ideas as protection of nature and bird sanctuaries.
There is good hope that they will soon show their voters that they
are still following the crowd, and that they will prove to the govern-
ment that they can keep abreast with general opinion.
All this contributed to create a favourable atmosphere in 1953 for
the activity of the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries. About that
time a marshland called ' Snepkensvijver ', beautifully situated
along a main road, was going to be parcelled out for building summer
houses. This splendid natural breeding place for many birds would
disappear for ever, and once again the authorities did not move.
The Society forced the issue. Within a few weeks, 1,000,000 F.
(about #7,150) was collected by means of a very few subscriptions,
ranging between 1,000 and 100,000 F. This put the Society in a
position to buy the land, and so become owner of its first bird sanctuary.
We still very much regret that the new Bird Protection Bill to
restrict bird catching, which was brought in by the three political
parties, was rejected in 1952. If the same bill had been introduced
a few years later, the same assembly would certainly have voted for it,
because public opinion is at present much more in favour of the
question.
The actual problem of bird protection in Belgium can be summarized
as follows :--
During the last two years a successful attempt has been made to
influence and educate public opinion about nature preservation and
the protection of wild animals. The population now expects some
practical results.
The Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries by chance started its
activities at the right moment. In three years 800 members j&amp;apos;oined
the Society, and the total annual contributions amount to 200,000 F.
(more than #1,300).
The first bird sanctuary in Belgium was ' De Zegge ', a marshland
of 35 Ha. The Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp purchased the
land for the purpose of establishing it as a bird sanctuary, and acted
in close co-operation with the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries,
which manages this natural reserve.
Thanks to the zeal of Mr. Leon Lippens, who collected nearly all
the money, the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries was able to
purchase # Snepkensvij&amp;apos;ver 5 , a marshland of 50 acres.
About sixty private estates have been declared as bird sanctuaries,
and the owners co-operate fully with the Society.

All these quick and rather spectacular successes, however, do not
produce the results that ornithologists might expect. The sanctuaries
are badly managed, and there is still a serious lack of supervision,
and too few investigations are made. This is because the number of
our members, who really do co-operate and take an interest in practical
field work is far too small.
It therefore has been decided to put a stop to declaring new estates
as bird sanctuaries, till we shall have a larger staff of trained co-
operators.
The actual private bird sanctuaries are still badly organized, but
we want to follow the British example, and hope to be able to attack
the problem squarely and well. We started with the protection of
nesting areas of rare species, and we are advising landowners and
training gamekeepers ; we give information to bird watchers on
useful subjects for research and investigation, and publish an annual
Bulletin, etc.
I fear the very short film I am going to show you will not come up
to your expectations. It has all been done in a hurry. We even had
no time to complete the film with some pictures of real interest to
ornithologists. This year spring was very late in Belgium, as was
perhaps the case in Britain too. We had to wait till last week to film
a few interesting nests, and I regret to say that the copies arrived too
late to be inserted in this film. A film which claims to be about bird
protection ought at least to show some rare nesting breeding birds,
and I offer my apologies.
Please remember too, that we were pressed to produce a film on
bird protection for the Belgian public. We know that our own
people are critical on the subject of films, and we would rather show
them high standard films, but as these require much time and money,
we think it is better policy in Belgium at the moment to produce
something that is not perfect, rather than nothing at all.
We must go on beating the drum every day, even when there is
a hole in the drum and the drumsticks are broken. It is the big
push that people expect now.
This method would not be suitable for Britain, so please try to
understand this, and excuse the gaps in the film. "
Mr. Van den bergh then showed the film which included pictures
of the bird sanctuary " De Zegge ", a marsh owned by the Royal
Zoological Society of Antwerp, in winter. The water was quite
overgrown with vegetation, and the film showed how some open water
was obtained and so the territory made more suitable for water-birds.
Nest-boxes were made in schools, and the boys offered them in
May to the Director of the County Park, which was declared a bird
sanctuary.

was purchased by the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries, were taken
in winter, others in spring. Attempts were successfully made here
to improve the conditions for the very large breeding population of
birds in this rather small area. More than one thousand Black-
headed Gulls are breeding here this year. The white cloud of birds
circling over their breeding-place is a very impressive sight. Besides
this great number of breeding gulls, forty-eight other species of birds
were breeding in the same habitat, and Mr. Van den bergh said he
regretted that he could not show some of them. The Bittern and its
nest was filmed, but this was not ready in time to be included.
Mr. Van den bergh then said :--
" From all this we may conclude, that Bird Protection in Belgium
has not passed its teething troubles.
The first obstacles, and most heavy ones, have been removed.
New members join every day.
No doubt, many of them will grow to active co-operators, who
will turn bird protection into a reality.
Britain showed the way. We follow in her footsteps."
The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m. for tea in the Library of the
Zoological Society, and later a sherry party was given by the Editor
of the Avicultural Magazine, Miss Barclay-Smith, at her house.
The meetings were resumed on Friday morning, 18th June, at
10.30 a.m., when Mr. G. T. lies , Superintendent, Belle Vue (Man-
chester) Zoological Gardens, showed a colour film entitled " Fine
Feathers ". Mr. lies gave a running commentary as he showed his
film, which depicted beautifully plumaged birds in the Belle Vue Zoo,
with other bird scenes from Gleres and Vincennes. The film ended
with a sequence in lighter vein, which showed the various ways in
which feathers are utilized, beginning with the wonderful head-
dress of the Red Indian.
The following papers were then contributed, illustrated with
lantern slides :--

following winter with a fine collection of birds, providing two birds
to each of five Zoos, with a gratifying number for his share in the
project.
When the pair reached the San Diego Zoo we were dismayed to
see that the cock bird, though in fine immature plumage, had a
badly swollen knee joint, already stiff, which would be likely to
prevent breeding.
The hen matured more rapidly than the male and during the
first summer, after only about six months in the Zoo, laid forty-seven
eggs. There had been no sign of mating nor mating display on the
part of the cock, and although we felt sure the eggs were infertile
they were tried both under hens and in the incubator without results.
In the following spring the male bird assumed complete nuptial
plumage and daily performed one of the most spectacular mating
displays we have ever seen among our large collection of such birds.
No actual mating took place so far as we could observe but we again
tried to incubate the eggs with hens, the incubator, and the Ocellated
Turkey herself. Again all of the eggs were clear.
We therefore decided that we would call upon the Poultry Depart-
ment of the University of California for assistance in using artificial
insemination. Dr. Arthur Kelly, Veterinarian of our Zoological
Garden, contacted Dr. V. S. Asmundson, of the College of Agriculture,
who eagerly agreed to assist us during the next breeding season. He
instructed us to try to incubate the first few eggs of the following
season and if they showed clear after the required number of hours
to call him or Dr. Frederick W. Lorenz, and he would do the work at
the University and the latter would fly down immediately to do the
actual insemination.
As we anticipated, the first few eggs were infertile, in spite of the
vigorous and beautiful display of the cock, and Dr. Lorenz was
contacted. The next morning he inseminated the hen with no
apparent shock to either bird. And as the result of this and a later
insemination, seventeen young Ocellated poults were hatched and
raised. Due to several cold spells several young of the first two broods
were lost. Small Red Jungle Fowl hens, which are excellent mothers
for any wild pheasants and other fowl, were used as foster parents,
but some of the young turkeys were brooder raised. Their diet
consists largely of protein, and green stuff and insects actually made up
the large part of their food.
Artificial insemination was used again the following year. However,
the third spring several of the young hens and the original hen mated
naturally with the two-year-old cocks and a fine large group of these
magnificent birds resulted. Although the original hen has mated
successfully with our young cocks, we felt it was wise to maintain the
original wild strain and so we have resorted to artificial insemination

during the last two years because the original pair are still produc-
tive.
We have been able to place a number of the birds in American
and European Zoos as well as the Agricultural Department of the
University of California. We feel especially hopeful of saving this
rare bird, by placing any large surplus of these birds in the collections
of some of the most successful game bird breeders of California and
south-western United States where they are removed from the public
contacts and other difficulties which face those who maintain public
exhibits.
I am happy to report that those we sent to European collections,
especially at Cleres and Rotterdam, are doing well and promise to
provide specimens for European Zoos and breeders, and we feel that
we have been more than justified in resorting to the expediency of
artificial insemination in our efforts to insure the continuance of this
magnificent bird, at least in captivity."
Mrs. Benchley showed slides of the adult birds, the egg, chick just
hatching, and a series of the chick at 4 days, 14 days, and 28 days old
respectively.
Mr. Kenton Lint, Curator of Birds, Zoological Society of San
Diego, wrote a full account of the successful breeding of the Ocellated
Turkeys in Captivity, which appeared in Bulletin No. 27 of that
Society. His paper contained the following summary in tabulated
form of the experiences at San Diego Zoological Garden from four
successive successful years, the first two of which depended entirely
upon artificial insemination, the last two being the recordings of the
success with only natural matings from two year old, zoo bred cocks.

" Breeding of the Andean Condor has occurred in several instances
in Zoos displaying a mature pair. Therefore, the story of mating
them at the San Diego Zoo is of importance only because of our
experiments in increasing the breeding rate of these magnificent birds.
These experiments have been carried on during a ten-year period
with the hope that if we succeeded in fulfilling our calculations we
might be able to change the dismal and hopeless destiny of a bird
dear to the heart of every " Californian ", the California Condor.
Unfortunately, a pair of these birds has never been housed in any
Zoo, all those in captivity most unfortunately having been females.
The breeding pattern of both species of Condor is one young bird
at two-year intervals, for a yearling bird is still dependent upon the
parents for food and protection, due to slow physical development.
In addition to this is a discouraging rate of reproduction, for the

Andean Condor requires eight years to reach productive age, and
while it has not positively been established, it is agreed by most
authorities that it is the same with the California Condor. Practical
conservationists have established that the likelihood of survival of
rare species depends greatly upon very definite facts in the pattern
of reproduction. First, the balance between the sexes in existing
specimens and their mating pattern, whether monogamous or poly-
gamous ; second, an important feature is the age at which they reach
productive maturity ; third, the number of offspring produced
annually and fourth, length of intervals between breeding periods.
On each of these the California Condor, like its next of kin the Andean
bird, has a poor success ratio. The breeding age is accepted as
seven or eight years. The California birds have no identifying sex
marks. Therefore, the ratio between sexes is completely unknown,
and the number of known breeding pairs among the estimated number
of birds is ridiculously low. Finally, the breeding speed is one egg
laid at intervals of two years. This stimulated our interest in making
a systematic study of the Andean Condors breeding in a huge flying
cage among a mixed group of eagles, kites, and small vultures.
The first egg laid, after a rather long and very spectacular courting
display, was misshapen and rough and was broken by the hen about
the sixth day. But fortunately she laid another within a few months.
From this there hatched out a fine, sooty-coloured chick, which could
be sexed the day it was hatched because of the small comb which is
present only in the male of this species.
The baby developed very slowly. Feeding and other forms of care
were shared by the parents, as the incubation had been. The baby
did not emerge from the nest until it had grown to be almost as large
as its parents, though still somewhat shaggy and a dull dark grey
instead of the shiny black of the adult. The care of the young bird
continued until it was a year old. A normal mating season was
skipped. In fact, it demanded attention until well into the second
year, as it did not fly, but used its wings only to aid it in hopping
about the imitation cliffs and ledges of its huge cage. The spring
before it was two years old, however, the parents began their mating
display, and on almost the same day as before the egg was deposited
and the second incubation period ensued. The Zoo decided that we
could afford to make an experimental study of this second bird,
feeling sure that our pair of Condors would not be disturbed by our
activities. And so, when the bird was ten months old it was removed
from the cage. At first he sulked, but soon began to eat greedily
whatever food he was offered.
The pair of adult birds, relieved of its care, almost at once began
their mating display and laid an egg in due time which, upon hatching,
turned out to be a female. The parents raised this second baby.

We had doubled normal production of Condors by raising two in two
years. However, we felt that perhaps even greater speed in raising
Condors might be necessary, for more and more discouraging reports
regarding California Condor scarcity were brought to the Zoo by
men actively concerned with wildlife preservation. Therefore, when
the Condors laid their first egg in the following May, we took the
egg away to be hatched in the incubator. In about thirty days after
the first egg was laid, a second egg was deposited in the nest. This
we left with the parents for incubation. Both eggs hatched and we
raised two Andean Condors in one year, one without any aid from the
parents.
The hand-feeding of a baby bird of prey, normally fed by regurgita-
tion, is difficult, requiring much time, study, and real imagination,
but we felt a good deal of pride in having produced four young which
normally would have been the product of four pairs of birds in two
years under normal wild conditions.
When we were able to repeat this performance for one more year
we made no further efforts and the pair returned to their normal
breeding pattern.
We wrote to the authorities in charge of wildlife in California,
setting forth the results of our experiments with the Andean Condors,
and calling to their attention that the few breeding California Condors
in a sanctuary surrounded by thickly populated areas had little chance
of survival through the mere setting aside of a proscribed area in
which the birds could nest without interference of man.
We offered to turn our enormous cage over to the project of
increasing the numbers of the California Condors. We did not ask
for a permit to trap, but offered to take and care for any Condors the
State could furnish. This came before the Fish and Game Com-
mission, a non-political body concerned with such projects, and they
told us they would prefer to give us a permit to trap a pair of Condors.
Immediately, to our amazement, those organizations supposed to be
concerned with preservation of wildlife, while admitting that the birds
apparently were decreasing under their programme, violently opposed
this permit or the caging of any Condors, and refused any request
even for us to enter the sanctuary which had been set up in the area
of the five or six known pairs of nesting Condors.
In spite of this opposition we asked for and received the permit to
trap a pair of Condors outside the sanctuary any time except during
the mating season. Opposition continued from these organized
groups, but during several months in which our permit was in
existence, weather conditions and scarcity of birds in areas to which
we could have access prevented successful trapping. Finally, the
Audubon Society which has for its object preservation of wild birds,
brought enough political pressure upon the State Legislature to

squeeze through, during the closing hours of the session, a bill
cancelling all permits to capture California Condors, and so we and
those who share our desire to find a solution to the problem of real
wildlife preservation, were stopped without any opportunity to make
an active, positive approach to one of the most tragic and discouraging
chapters on preservation of a rare species that is taking place in the
world."

" European collections of pheasants were at a low ebb just at the end
of the last war. Only a small stock of some rare species remained in
England, at Leckford, and in Belgium, at Beez. Mr. Spedan Lewis,
with the help of the late Miss Chawner and of Mr. Milligan, had
saved a few pairs of Temminck's Tragopans, Mikado Pheasants, Grey
Peacock Pheasants, and a few others, while Mme. Malisoux had
Satyrs and Blyth's, Tragopans, Greys, and Palawan Peacock-Pheasants.
Prof. Ghigi still had birds at Bologna, and a number of pairs of the
commoner species were to be found here and there. In America,
however, pheasants were still plentiful and soon many found their way
to Europe. The pheasantry at Cleres was replenished by consignments
from England and from America and so were several other continental
collections.
The situation after nearly ten years has greatly improved, although
importations of wild caught birds have been few. Several species
however have come on several occasions : Palawan Peacock-Pheasants
and Japanese Copper Pheasants have reached California ; also a few
Malay Argus and Crested Firebacks. From India came Satyr Trago-
pans, Koklass and Impeyan Monals. But the number of birds bred in
captivity both in America and in Europe is constantly increasing. They
sell readily and there is no doubt that the taste for pheasant keeping is
also increasing, particularly in America and in Continental Europe.
This is not the case in England where practically only two collections
exist at the present time, at Leckford, at Whipsnade and in London
(Zoological Society).
It is a curious fact that pheasant breeding has always been
a neglected branch of aviculture in Great Britain while bird-keeping
generally has long been more popular and more successful there than
perhaps anywhere else, although one must remember that more species

have been reared in captivity for the first time at the London Zoo, over
a hundred years ago, than at any other place.
Belgium and Holland have very fine collections at present, mostly
private ; but the excellent Rotterdam Zoo has greatly contributed to
the promotion of pheasant keeping by importing several rare species
and by rearing them in special secluded quarters, an example that
other zoological gardens should follow.
There still are a number of private pheasant breeders in France,
where the market for birds is excellent. The fairly large numbers reared
at Cleres every year fall, by a long way, short of the demand. The
same is true of Italy.
Pheasant keeping in America is continually progressing. Not only
the American Pheasant Society, national in scope, but several local
clubs and groups, are active, and the number of birds reared each year
is considerable throughout the country. The largest and finest collec-
tion to-day is that of Mr. R. H. Gibson at St. Helena, California, but
there are many others, some very rich. The rarer species now reared
in the United States include Malay Argus, Palawan, Gray and
Germain's Peacock-Pheasants, Imperial, Edwards, Bel's (Berlioz),
Mikado, Elliot's, Cheer Pheasants, Malay and Siamese Firebacks,
Green and Sonnerat's Junglefowls, Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans.
Blue Eared-Pheasants are plentiful and there is a fair number of
Brown, which unfortunately are not breeding so freely as in the old
days. Spicifer Peafowl are common in the west. White Eared-
Pheasants are raised each year in small numbers, but their situation is
precarious. Some have been crossed with Blue and the three-quarter
bred birds are very similar to pure white. Perhaps this introduction of
new blood may save the stock, which is not likely now to be soon
renovated by imports from Western China. A few Bornean Crested
Firebacks remain, but none has been reared in some years. No Copper
Pheasants have so far been bred from the stock of birds recently
imported.
There are just a few Cabot's Tragopans now in the United States,
in England, and in Holland, and it is hoped that this beautiful species
may soon be re-established, as it was one of the commonest in captivity.
As to Blyth's, they are reduced to one pair, unfortunately so far infertile,
in Mme. Malisoux's collection."

eyries.
The waders depicted were Avocet, recently re-established as a British
nesting species after a lapse of 125 years, Redshank, Curlew, Common
Sandpiper, Snipe, Common Plover, Ringed Plover, Kentish Plover
(now extremely rare as a nesting species), and Oystercatcher.
All the British nesting species of gulls were shown, Great Black-

Blackheaded ; Common and Lesser Tern, Razorbill, Guillemot, and
Puffin, and finally several illustrations of the Gannet colony on Grass-
holm, with an estimated population of 15-20,000 birds.
All the slides were of a very high standard and of perfection in
colour rarely seen. The slides of the Peregrine tearing its prey and the
Razorbills in flight were especially outstanding.

temperature of the egg chamber. Mr. Frith stated that this process
usually results in a loss of heat and cooling of the egg chamber, which
is contrary to the usually accepted theory that it causes an increase
in temperature by means of solar heat. Only towards the end of the
breeding season does it become necessary for the birds to make use of
the heat of the sun, and they achieve this by removing the soil cover to
within an inch or so of the eggs during the day. Mr. Frith then
showed a colour film, the first ever to be taken of this subject, of the
Mallee Fowl and their mound, the hen laying eggs, the position of
the eggs when laid, and the birds attending to the mound. One

With the experience of many years as director of the Zoological
Park, Edinburgh, Gillespie (1932) writes, " of all the animals in a
zoological park or garden, there is none more popular than the
penguins." Yet these birds are almost unknown outside zoos because
they are difficult to procure, expensive to keep, and more prone than
any others to disease. Moreover, only a few hardy species breed
successfully in captivity. The aim of every zoo would, no doubt, be
to build up a healthy and contented community of breeding penguins
under conditions as near as possible to their natural environment.
Can a knowledge of the natural history of these birds studied in the
wild in any way benefit them in captivity ? I believe it can in many
practical ways. In this paper I propose to give a very brief resume of
some conclusions made from a study in the wild, and then to discuss
the possible practical applications of this knowledge to those in
captivity.
A STUDY IN THE WILD
My knowledge of penguins in their natural environment is limited
to seven species that breed in the Antarctic and Falkland Islands.
The three Pygoscelid Penguins, the Adelie, Pygoscelis adeliae, Chin-
strap,* P. antarctica , and the Gentoo, P. papua, were studied closely
between 1948 and 1951. Much of what follows concerns these, and
particularly the Adelie.f The principles discussed, which are in very
general terms, can I feel be applied to other species.
Individual variation , familiar to all who keep animals in captivity or
study large samples in the wild, needs re-emphasizing. Penguins are
gregarious birds, and differences in temperament play an important
part in captivity.
Age and breeding experience do not appear to have been stressed
enough in previous literature. An Adelie community can be divided
into three main groups according to age and breeding experience ;
the " experienced " (or established) breeders ; the " inexperienced "
(or unestablished) breeders, and the non-breeders. On the whole,
the " experienced " breeders return to the same nests and keep the
* Often called the Ringed, Bearded, or Antarctic Penguin. I agree with Murphy
( 1 936) that the South American name " Pinguin de Barbijo ", equivalent to " Chin-
strap Penguin ", is the best vernacular name for this species.

same mates from year to year. " Inexperienced 55 birds, breeding for
the first or possibly second time when two to four years old, first have
to obtain nest sites and mates. To start with they may have to choose
inferior sites such as the edge of the colony where the snow melts last
and Skuas, Stercorarius skua , and Sheathbills, Chionis alba , can rob their
nests more readily. Their behaviour differs from that of the ex-
perienced breeders. Courtship is more prolonged, fighting more
frequent, breeding efficiency lower. The birds in Photo 2 were
found on the edge of a colony. The female, while arranging herself
more comfortably on her poorly built nest (compare with Photo 5)
has inadvertently scraped away the egg with her feet. The Sheath-
bills behind are waiting for an opportunity to get at the egg, perforate
it with their bill, and suck the contents. These little white birds,
which do very well in captivity, know all about the penguins in their
territory, and it is to nests such as these that they pay most attention.
The non-breeders having no permanent attachments to territory, are
seen in small parties walking around the rookery, or wandering far
away inspecting rocky outcrops as much as 1,000 feet above sea level.
A lone male might temporarily occupy territory, build a large nest,
and keep company with a female. Next season this pair might
come together again and breed for the first time. It is these
" wanderers " and some of the unestablished " inexperienced "
breeders which, under favourable conditions, will extend the range
of the species by establishing colonies in new situations. They are
also an important reserve population, ever ready to fill gaps. There
is, of course, considerable overlap in these age groups due to individual
variation. The only really satisfactory way to study these complexities
is by long term research on marked birds of known age ; a lead
which has been given by Richdale (1951).
Sex differences .--The birds appear to be able to tell each others'
sex, though to a human observer this is almost impossible. True,
females are usually smaller and shier than males, but measurements
and the temperaments of both sexes overlap to a considerable degree.
One of the most reliable methods of sexing breeding birds is the one
used by Richdale (1951), in which he compares the dilated, and
maybe blood-stained, cloaca of the female soon after egg laying with
that of her mate. Two birds seen copulating is another reliable
indication of the sexes, though the possibility of homosexual and
abnormal heterosexual relationships (especially in captivity) must
not be ignored. In the Adelie additional evidence can be gleaned
from breeding routine and courtship behaviour. For example, the
male is always the first to incubate the newly-laid eggs, while his
mate goes off to sea to feed. The ecstatic display (Photo 3) is confined
to males during the early part of the season before egg laying and
during incubation. These sex differences, though unreliable in other

<bodyText confidence="0.994665545454545" page_id="56238292"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
species, do however suggest that an intimate knowledge of the breeding
routine in the wild would help in many ways. The only certain way to
sex penguins (other than by dissection) would thus be to mark them
early in the breeding season and observe their breeding behaviour
closely. By the time the eggs have been laid, it should be possible
to tell in most cases which is male and which is female.
Affinity, a word understood in human social structures, but little
mentioned in works on birds, has been emphasized by Richdale (1951)
in his ten year study of marked Yellow-eyed Penguins, Megadyptes
antipodes. One interesting example given concerns a female (A)
who had an affinity for male (B), when (B) was already mated to
another female (C) and she, (A), already mated to male (D). In
September, 1939, just before the eggs were laid, (A) and (B) were
seen " keeping company " at (B's) nest when the rightful female (C)
returned to the nest and ousted (A). For this season and the next,
both (B) and (C), and (A) and (D), remained together at their
respective nests, but in the autumn of 1941, after her chicks had been
reared successfully, (C) disappeared. (A) forthwith deserted (D) and
joined (B) at his nest. But the story does not end here, for (A) and
(B) remained together and bred successfully for the next three seasons,
their union only being broken when (A) was unhappily killed in a
rabbit trap. Also interesting is the fact that (A's) former mate (D)
remained without a partner the season after (A) had deserted him.
Moreover, during the six consecutive seasons that Richdale followed
the intimacies of their lives, this male (D) had three different mates,
and twice remained unmated. He was perhaps an " odd man out ".
The Adelie, though generally more faithful to its territory and
partners (Andrew and Roberts, 1951) than the Yellow-eyed Penguin,
shows these discerning qualities as well. They not only take in their
surroundings, but are most aware of the temperaments of other birds
around them. The affinity of one bird towards another plays an
important part in pair formation and in other social relationships in
the breeding area.
Breeding routine varies much from species to species. Only a few
points which have practical application in captivity will be mentioned.
(1) Fasting periods .--Probably all Penguins fast during the moult,
and may lose as much as 40 per cent of their body weight. The
Antarctic species seem to be the only ones that fast for really long
periods during the breeding season. The male Emperor, Aptenodytes
forsteri, fasts the longest, eating nothing for at least sixty days (Stone-
house, 1953) and probably longer, during incubation. The Adelie
comes next. Once arrived at the beginning of the season, it will not
return to sea to feed until the eggs have been laid, and then it is the
female that departs first, leaving the male alone. It is only when the

female returns recuperated that the male can break his fast. The
duration averages forty days (Figure i), and his weight, starting at
about 6-5 Kgm., will drop to about 3*5 Kgm. A fortnight at sea,
however, is long enough for this bird to regain most of its lost weight.

(2) Nest sites and nest building. --Some penguins, for example, the
Magellanic, Spheniscus magellanicus , and Black-footed, S. demersus, build
their nests in burrows. Of the majority that lay their eggs above
ground, the King, Aptenodytes patagonica , and Emperor are the only
species that do not build a nest. The others build with the materials
most easily available. Thus, in the Falkland Islands the Gentoo builds
its nest of grass and twigs of " Diddle-dee ", Empetrum rubrum, whereas
in the Antarctic, where there is almost no vegetation, nest material is
confined to stones (Photo 6) and the occasional bone of their dead
companions.

guarding the chick (Photo 4) and feeding, while the other returns to
sea to collect more food. Feeding is at intervals of one or two
days, the chicks' stomachs having a great capacity for holding the food
regurgitated to them. When the chicks are too large for guarding, the
parents leave them to look after themselves and are both away at the
same time collecting food. Visits then become more irregular. Most
of the species that breed close together in big colonies, such as the
Adelie, Chin-strap, Emperor, and King, have what is known as the
creche system where the chicks group together in large numbers up to
two hundred or even more. I believe this is chiefly for protection from
predators, and in particular from the Skua. This bird will attack and
kill any chicks that are isolated from the creche and alone. Another
factor is protection from the cold, the importance of which has been
emphasized in the Emperor by Stonehouse (1953). When Adelie
chicks begin to moult their down and show their first year plumage,

<bodyText confidence="0.998122522727273" page_id="56238296"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
they no longer seek the protection of the creches and disperse back to
their nest sites. Skuas can now be seen walking among the chicks
which do not show fright, for the chicks quickly repel those that
approach too close. The Skuas thus respect penguins that show a bold
front. During my studies on the Pygoscelid Penguins I was constantly
impressed by the fact that these predators, almost without exception,
attacked the weak or stupid chicks only.
Individual recognition .--Richdale has shown that Yellow-eyed Penguins
recognize others in the community, and parents recognize
their own chicks. Unlike the Adelie, whose chicks group together in
creches, the Yellow-eyed Penguins' nests are scattered among rough
and wooded country. Previous literature on the Adelie summed up
by Murphy (1936) suggests that parents do not recognize their chicks
in the creche and that they feed indiscriminately. In 1948-49 ,1 placed
coloured rings round the flippers of chicks of marked parents before
they went into the creches and discovered that the parents found and
fed their own offspring, and only under exceptional circumstances
led strangers. A substantial amount of evidence was also collected
to support the fact that the pair-bond between two Adelies was
maintained more as a result of the individuals recognizing each other
from year to year (even after separation during the winter months)
than by their return to the same nest sites. Penguins recognize each
others' features, gait, movements and voice. The mutual display
seen so frequently between two of a pair and between parents and
chicks at the nest, and later when a parent comes back to feed its
young in the creche, has an important function in the Adelie, for I
believe the noise and movements confirm as well as re-enforce
recognition.
Individual recognition thus plays a very much more important
part in a penguin community than has generally been supposed. The
more one studies these interesting birds by marking them, the more
is one impressed by the orderliness of their social structure, a structure
based on many attributes which are taken for granted in human
behaviour, but which might be thought incredible in such a lowly
animal.
Porpoising is the normal swimming movement of penguins and is
used by no other birds. Adelies porpoising at high speed is a
truly magnificent sight. Swimming for several yards under water
they surface, and, barely rising as much as a foot, vanish under
the surface again a few feet ahead. They no doubt breathe each time
they surface, and can travel at ten knots or more. When landing,
an Adelie (Photo 7) or Gentoo will pop out of the water like a jack-
in-the-box, clearing up to six feet of ice-cliff in an almost vertical
leap. Sometimes they land erect and, balanced by their tails, run

feet, they will fall on to their bellies and toboggan along the snow
surface in a most enchanting and amusing manner.
Pathological conditions in the Adelie , Chin-strap , and Gentoo Penguins .--
Infestation with intestinal parasites was the only constant patho-
logical condition found in wild penguins. The amount of infestation
varied according to the species, and in the case of the Gentoos also
according to their breeding distribution. For example, the Falkland
Islands breeding Gentoos were almost free, whereas the ones breeding
in Graham Land and the South Orkneys were riddled with a cyst-
forming cestode.
Many wild birds were dissected,* but in none was found any macro-
scopic evidence of the fungal infection which causes mycosis. More-
over, forty-one cultures taken from throats of healthy Penguins at
their breeding places or within six days of capture, though they grew
a variety of moulds, did not demonstrate any that were potentially
pathogenic. These cultures, collected by swabbing the part of the
throat around the nasal passages and epiglottic region, were grown on
Sabouraud's media, and brought back to the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for identification. More work of this
nature is required, for evidence that the spores of pathogenic moulds
do not occur as normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tracts of
wild birds is still fragmentary. Nor is there sufficient evidence that
the spores reach the birds via infected foodstuffs (Sladen, 1952).
Wild penguins are therefore remarkably free from disease and it is
only when they are brought into captivity that they become
susceptible.

CAPTURE AND TRAVEL

How can our knowledge of penguins in the wild be used to build
up a healthy and contented community of breeding birds in captivity ?
We have seen that they know each other as individuals, usually keep
the same partners from year to year, and come back to the same
area, and often to the exact nest-site, to breed. Affinity draws some
together ; lack of affinity repels others. Disease appears to be
accelerated when a bird is unhappy and lonely ; morale higher when
their gregarious nature is satisfied. In the light of such knowledge,
the capture of penguins becomes a job which should not be under-
taken indiscriminately, as is so often the case, but in a careful and
thoroughly scientific manner. I believe the best way to do this would
be to collect a complete section of a penguin colony. This section
should include peripheral nests as well as central ones for, as already
* It was necessary to feed our sledge-dogs on seal and penguin meat. Maximum
biological use was made from all collected for this purpose, and particular care was
taken to cause no unnecessary waste of life.

explained, the inexperienced younger birds are more likely to be on
the edge than inside. In theory, this sounds excellent, but it may be
difficult to put into practice. For example, at what time of the
season should they be collected ? This can only be answered according
to knowledge of the breeding routine and habits of the individual
species, a knowledge which is still incomplete for most, and is thus
quite out of the scope of this paper. A few general principles should,
however, be discussed.
First, the birds should not be incubating or rearing chicks, for
one of the pair is likely to be away at sea. Second, though most
species return to their breeding place to moult, after recuperating
from the breeding season at sea, and during this period fast for
about a fortnight, the physiological upset at this time would make
travelling (especially through the tropics) undesirable and probably
dangerous for the birds. Thus the only good time to collect
birds, as a community, may prove to be during the short period after
most of the colony have settled down into pairs at their nest sites and
before eggs are laid. The Antarctic is still ice-bound when the Adelies
are at this stage. The Chin-strap colonies might be more accessible
for their breeding cycle starts roughly one month later, and the first
eggs are laid at the end of November or early December. Penguins
that breed in the Sub-Antarctic and more temperate zones, and
particularly the non-migratory species, should present fewer problems,
and I would suggest that this method of collecting a section of the
community should be tried first on these.
It is now generally accepted by zoos that the expense of transporting
penguins by air is worth while. In my own experience, they travel
best if standing on half-inch mesh wire netting in a box of similar
design to that recommended in the Third Annual Report (1949-50)
of the Severn Wildfowl Trust. A slatted front with sack curtain is
much safer than a wire netting front, through which they thrust and
often damage their bills.

Two, often conflicting, points of view must be considered : the
birds', and the zoo's.
From the Birds' point of view.
(1) A community of the same species .--Many zoos are justifiably
anxious to exhibit as big a variety of animals as possible. For penguins,
however, there should be a different approach, an approach which
concentrates on building up reasonable sized communities of at least
ten pairs each of, say, two or three individual species. Zoos in different
parts of Britain and America will eventually discover which of the
eighteen possible species of penguin are most suited to their climate
and conditions. How much more interesting and instructive will it

then be to visit different places boasting successful breeding colonies
of their own specialities.
(2) Acclimatization .--The first year in captivity usually takes the
greatest toll of wild birds. More attention paid to acclimatization
during this period, for example, by transporting them direct to a
spacious quarantine station in the country, might save money in the
long run. The upkeep of a lake and enclosures would be prohibitive
for one zoo, but could be shared by several. A station like this could
solve many problems of quarantine in zoos, and also prove of immense
value as a centre for investigating avian disease, and especially mycosis,
in captivity. Unfit birds could be sent there for observation and would,
no doubt, stand a better chance of recovery than if left in unfavourable
and cramped conditions in zoos. Gillespie (1932) stresses the fact that
King Penguins, once recovered from the strain of their voyage to
Europe, become indifferent to conditions of weather and temperature,
and if anything, prefer the sunshine. Thus the most important
functions of acclimatization would be (i) to build the birds up to the
health they enjoyed before capture, (ii) to allow them to adapt them-
selves to different food and a new fresh water environment and,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.658612666666667" page_id="56238301"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
probably the most important, (iii) to give them a chance to adjust
themselves to a very much less active life in captivity.
(3) Space and nesting sites .--From the birds' point of view, obviously
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993933272727273" page_id="56238301"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
the larger the enclosure and the deeper and bigger the lake the
happier they will be. There must be limits, but the limits set by many
zoos are too severe. Penguins in captivity are very rarely seen por-
poising because the ponds are too small and shallow. They are
sometimes even deprived of their natural nest material. If they build
nests of stones or grass they should be given stones, or typical grasses
planted in their enclosures (as is most successfully done at Edinburgh
Zoo). If they nest underground in burrows, they should have a
suitable place for this. Due to lack of appreciation of their habits and
behaviour in the wild, these very simple but fundamental require-
ments are often overlooked; yet one or two small points rectified might
tip the balance in favour of breeding.
(4) Human interference is a difficult and controversial topic. Should
birds that refuse food be force-fed ? Should a bird that scratches
away its new laid egg from the nest, or tramples its young chick, be
interfered with ? These questions I cannot answer with any authority
for birds in captivity, but in the wild this kind of behaviour is seen
frequently where certain species normally fast for long periods, and
where many apparent inconsistencies in behaviour and temperament
can be attributed to age and breeding experience (Photo 2) as well
as to variation among individuals. The establishment of a reasonable
sized community of one species would minimize the need for human

<bodyText confidence="0.991581636363636" page_id="56238302"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">
interference because the birds would be happier and
would not matter losing the odd egg or young chick.
(5) " Occupational therapy ."--No better example can be given than
the King Penguin parade to the post-box at Edinburgh. This kind
of activity has public appeal, and gives the birds something else to look
forward to as well as their food. The exercise keeps them in condition,
while all the time they are becoming more familiar with humans at
close quarters. If this sort of therapy is not practicable, they should at
least be given their natural nest material to " play " with, or suitable
breeding burrows to excavate.
From the Zoo&amp;apos;s point of view.
A balanced view must, of course, be taken, for penguins are not
the only animals in a zoo ! Much will depend on the size of the
zoo, its situation, and financial commitments. A large zoo could
probably afford the upkeep of a large enclosure with communities
of two or three species. There is no reason why species should not be
mixed, in fact the contrast in behaviour between one kind and another
is most entertaining. In the Antarctic, the Adelies, Chin-straps, and
Gentoos breed in the same rookeries, and often side by side. On
Deception Island, South Shetlands, a small colony of Macaroni
Penguins, Eudyptes chrysolphus , nest amidst a community of hundreds
of thousands of Chin-straps. A small crowded zoo would save
unnecessary expense and disappointment by purchasing captive bred
penguins, and concentrating on one species only. If enclosures
must, of necessity, be small, some form of " occupational therapy "
will help to keep them happier.
Acclimatization for a year, although ideal for the penguins, will
be an additional financial burden for a zoo whose aim is naturally
to have the birds on show as soon as possible. This approach, as
already explained, should save money in the long run. Hygiene is
another controversial subj'ect, though the zoos that worry least about
this appear to have the best breeding results. Penguins live in squalor
in the wild, and I therefore believe it more important that they have
adequate nesting material and surroundings than a barren and
uninteresting enclosure designed for frequent ablutions. Surely visitors
to a zoo have to be prepared for a few strange smells. A community
of penguins would, however, find it difficult to compete with the
odours that come from the elephants, seals, or a wallowing hippo-
potamus. Moreover, incubating penguins are often fasting, and their
excreta quite innocuous. Carefully designed enclosures could dis-
courage the accumulation of too much guano, and still allow the birds
plenty of scope for breeding in as near a natural environment as
possible.

A STUDY IN CAPTIVITY

<bodyText confidence="0.8781885" page_id="56238303"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
A study in captivity cannot take the place of a study in the wild,
for three important reasons :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.71262275" page_id="56238303"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
(i) The birds are in confined and abnormal surroundings.
(ii) A large enough sample cannot be studied to make allowances
for variation among individuals.
(iii) Those in authority in zoos are naturally reluctant to allow

<bodyText confidence="0.9957148" page_id="56238303"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
birds or their young to be handled.
There is, however, an almost unexplored field for research on many
practical aspects of life in captivity, and these, correlated with a
knowledge of the same species' behaviour in the wild would ultimately
help to solve many problems such as breeding efficiency, the moult,
mycosis, and some aspects of behaviour. So many ideas and
" hunches " are founded on isolated examples, and it is only by
systematic and well planned research on a small community that our
knowledge can be really furthered.
As in the wild, one of the most important aids to a study in captivity
is to mark the birds. I do not wish to refute the fact that the keepers
and those who spend a long time with their birds recognize them
as individuals. They no doubt do if the number is small enough,
but research workers come and go, and valuable material is sure to
be lost during the penguin's life span of ten to twenty years. They
should therefore be marked with metal rings as soon as they arrive in
the collection. These rings, bearing a large reference number (or
popular name for each individual if preferred for public enjoyment),
are best attached round the flipper (Photo 8), in the axilla so that the
number can be plainly read from a distance. These flipper-rings
(Sladen, 1952a), must be put on very carefully, otherwise they will
injure the bird. Richdale (1951a) marked his wild birds with tarsus
rings. These also require skill and care, and though successful with
the New Zealand penguins, are unsuitable for the Antarctic species
which nested on rocky ground.

Dr. Edward Hindle, Mr. G. S. Mottershead, Chester Zoo,
Mr. D. H. S. Ridson, Dudley Zoo, and Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith,
took part in the discussion on penguins in captivity which followed.
The President of the Conference then moved a vote of thanks to
the President and Council of the Zoological Society of London for
the loan of their meeting room and many other facilities, and this was
agreed with acclamation.
Miss Barclay-Smith then said she would like to move a particularly
warm vote of thanks to Mr. L. Ellis, Library Assistant of the Zoological
Society, who had been in charge of all the projection of films and slides,
during the Conference, and to whom a great deal of the success of
the meetings was due. This was received with prolonged applause.
A vote of thanks to Miss Barclay-Smith for presiding over the
meetings was moved by Miss E. M. Knobel, Vice-President of the
Society, and the proceedings then terminated.
On Saturday afternoon a Garden Party was held at Foxwarren
Park, Cobham, Surrey, at the invitation of the President of the
Avicultural Society and Mrs. Ezra, and was attended by 150 guests.
In the evening the closing dinner was held at the Rembrandt
Hotel, at which one hundred members and guests were present.

By J. J. Yealland
Mr. and Mrs. G. M. Durrell have recently returned from Argentina
and Paraguay, bringing a small collection of birds, mammals, and
amphibians. Some of these were presented to the Society, and the
remainder to the Paignton Zoo. Among the birds were a Brown
Cachalote [Pseudoseisura lophotes ), the first of this genus to be exhibited
here ; a Southern White-breasted Crake ( Creciscus leucopyrrhus) , also
known as the Red and White Crake, and two d'Orbigny's Pectoral
Sparrows ( Arremon orbignii ), new to the collection.
Two Guira Cuckoos ( Guira guira) ; an Argentine Lapwing ( Belonop -
terus cayennensis grisescens) ; two Jendaya Conures [Eupsittula jendaya) ;
a Scarlet-headed Marsh Bird (. Anblyrhamphus holosericeus) ; a Green
Cardinal ( Gubernatrix cristata) ; two Yellow-billed Cardinals ( Paroaria
capitata) ; a Brazilian Blue Grosbeak ( Cyanocompsa cyanea) ; three
Striated Tanagers ( Thraupis bonariensis) ; two Violet Tanagers [Tanagra
violacea ), and a Blue Sugar-bird (. Dacnis cay ana) complete this
interesting presentation.
It will be seen that not all these birds were collected in Argentina
and Paraguay ; some were obtained in Rio de Janeiro on the way
home.
The Daily Mail Himalayan Expedition has presented two Satyr
Tragopans ( Tragopan satyra) ; a Himalayan Monal (. Lophophorus
impejanus) and a Himalayan Snow Partridge ( Tetraogallus himalayensis) ;
Mr. Sibley sent a gift of two Lapland Buntings [Calcarius lap-
ponicus) ; two Yellow Buntings [Emberiza citrinella) ; a Reed Bunting
[Emberiza schceniclus) ; four Twites [Carduelis flavirostris ) ; two Lesser
Redpolls [C. jlammea cabaret) ; a Goldfinch [C. carduelis britannica) ;

two Lesser Whitethroats (Sylvia curruca) ; a Wheatear ( (Enanthe
csnanthe), and a Greenland Wheatear (CE. ce. leucorrhoa). A Kittiwake
Gull (. Rissa tridactyla) has also been presented.
Three Pileated Jays (Cyanocorax chrysops) ; a pair of Wedge-tailed
Sunbirds (. Anthobaphes violacea) , and a Black-headed Bunting ( Emberiza
melanocephala) have been purchased ; a Brown Thrasher (Toxostoma
rufum) deposited, and six King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonica ) ; four
Purple Herons (Ardea purpurea) ; a pair of Teal (Anas crecca ), Common
Wigeon (A. penelope ), and Common Sheld-Duck (Tadorna tadorna)
have been received in exchange. Two Night Herons, six Egyptian
Geese, two Upland Geese, a Silver Gull, a Black-footed Penguin, five
Red-rumped Parrakeets, and three Greenfinches have been bred.
The King Penguins, Rheas, Snowy Owls, and Green-winged King
Parrakeets have eggs ; the Canada, Greenland White-fronted, and
Emperor Geese all laid infertile clutches.
The Marabou Storks and Indian Wood Ibises showed signs of
nesting, and carried twigs about, but nothing came of it. The Choughs
got as far as hatching a chick, but it did not long survive.
It is hoped that the aviary for homing Budgerigars will be finished
by mid-July.

Few of our members have been so consistently successful in breeding
rare birds as Sidney Porter. During the past thirty years he has had
many successes, but now there is the prospect of one to eclipse all
previous--the Malachite Sunbird. The first nest contained an egg
with a fully-developed young one that failed to emerge. The hen is
again sitting on two eggs--this time it is to be hoped with a happier

C. af Enehjelm, Helsingfors, reports one Black-crested Finch fully
reared ; two left the nest, but one was weakly and soon died. The
parents are again on three eggs. Also reared : one Red-headed Parrot
Finch, five Cherry Finches, one Fire Finch, three Ruficaudas, three
Bichenows, and five Cordon Bleus. It has been a bad year so far
for Parrot Finches ; many clear eggs and one young one from one
pair ; three other pairs have done nothing at all.

D. Bowles, Director-Secretary, Royal Zoological Society of Scotland,
reports on the breeding of King Penguins in the Edinburgh Zoo, 1953 :
" Thirteen King Penguin eggs were laid, of which five proved to be
infertile. Of the remaining eight, three chicks hatched, but one died
a few days afterwards. This meant that five birds were found dead in
the shell, and it appears almost certain that the reason for this was
some violent electric storms which occurred a few days before the
eggs were due to hatch, causing the parents to desert the eggs, which
were thus allowed to chill resulting in the death of the inmates."
Altogether, a total of 23 Penguin eggs were laid, from which seven

A nest of four blue Ring-necked Parrakeets, not three as previously
reported, were hatched at Keston. Misfortune, however, overtook this
brood. Vice-President Boosey writes : " My heart sank as each day
became colder and colder about the middle of May, as I knew the
young Ringnecks would be in that critical stage when they are too
big for their mother to brood them, but they are only just starting
to feather. Finally, when the parents had started to eat less and less,
I decided to look in the nest-box, and found three well-grown young
ones in the quill stage, dead ; only the fourth and eldest, which was
better-clothed, being still alive." The fourth young one eventually
left the nest, but was later found dead in the shelter--possibly killed
by a marauding Magpie.

A tragedy of another kind has occurred at a well-known zoo. A pair
of Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos showed great interest in a nest-
box, and when they disappeared it was assumed they were nesting
in earnest. When, after several days, the box was inspected, the two
Cockatoos were found to be dead, having been unable to climb out.
Since then we have heard of a Leadbeater's Cockatoo suffering a
similar fate. These events are cited as a warning to breeders to make
doubly sure that their birds have an easy means of climbing up to the
entrance hole.

Kathleen Deery de Phelps. Published by the Creole Petroleum
Corporation, Caracas, Venezuela.
This attractive book, the first illustrated book on the birds of
Venezuela to be published, does great credit to its author, who is also
responsible for the coloured plates. It contains a hundred coloured
illustrations of the best known birds in Venezuela with a descriptive
text about the bird, its nest, eggs, and other details, together with a
map showing its distribution. The distribution maps are coloured
differently, each colour indicating a different zone according to the
altitude, for instance the tropical zone o m. to 1,500 metres is depicted
in red, the sub-tropical zone, or 1,500 to 2,500 metres, in yellow, the
temperate zone from 2,500 to 3,500 in blue, and the heights above this
in grey. By this method it can be seen at a glance at what altitudes the
bird is found. Hints are given as to the food to be put out for birds,

and how to attract them to the garden by the provision of water.
Advice on photographing birds is added and also ideas for noting
observations. A section deals with the protection of birds pointing out
that they have many enemies and drawing attention to their
usefulness in destroying harmful insects.
The book, which is primarily intended for distribution among the
schools of Venezuela, is one that all those interested in the colourful
birds of the South American continent will wish to possess. The Creole
Petroleum Corporation are to be congratulated on their far-sightedness
in making the publication of this book possible for it will undoubtedly
do much to arouse an interest in the birds of Venezuela both in that
country and other parts of the world. Anyone wishing to obtain the
book should write to the Creole Petroleum Corporation, Caracas,
Venezuela.

You may be interested to hear that I have another pair of African Greys with
young. After one abortive attempt--due I think to interference, unintentional, on
my part--the hen went to nest again in March. I have not dared--after my first
experience--to disturb the birds, so do not really know what has happened. I am
satisfied, however, that at this date there must be young as one or other of the birds
is always on the nest.
Incidentally, amongst my " run of the aviary " breeding successes this year, I have
managed to rear two lots--each of two--of Crested Barbets and one of Magpie Robins

(from India). A third brood of Crested Barbets was lost--again because of inter-
ference. The more breeding I have the good fortune to supervise, the more I am
convinced that losses are to a very large extent caused by the intentional or unin-
tentional interference of the over-curious and impatient owner.
I recently procured, in very damaged condition, a Little or Pigmy Bee-eater.
I have now had it a month or so, and it is very nearly back to normal. I have force-fed
it on meat, which it still does not always take willingly, and on grasshoppers, meal-
worms, etc., and I now see no reason why it should not make the grade. I am quite
proud of this achievement, for which I must thank my wife who struggled manfully
while I was away at office, as this is the first Bee-eater I have ever tried to keep.
Contrary to what I have read, this Bee-eater is far from silent--in fact on a warm
day it keeps up a constant chattering, and has a very pretty little song.

Breeding Golden-shouldered X Hooded Parrakeet Hybrids
The Golden-shouldered is exceptionally rare. For the last twenty-five years I have
made many attempts to procure them, without success, until this year when two
birds came into my hands. As these were both males, I had no alternative but to
give them females of their closest relative--the Hooded Parrakeet. One male
immediately commenced driving the female, and proceeded to dig a large hole
under their bath trough. The female, however, preferred a nesting box, which the
male eventually agreed to. Four eggs were produced and four youngsters are now
completely reared--three males and one female. It was most interesting that this
small, cheeky bird would immediately attack me on entering the aviary, and on
several occasions it nipped my ear, or the back of my hand. Another point of great
interest is that the Golden-shouldered and the hybrid can be sexed as soon as they
leave the nest. The female is quite plain, but the male is very much brighter.
For the breeding season commencing May of 1955, I am proud to say that (ex-
cluding hybrids) at least four pairs of Golden-shouldered are already in my aviaries.

It may be of interest to your members to hear that I am now in my second season
with Fischer's and Masked Lovebirds, which I am flying at liberty.
The original pair homed to a flight 6 feet by 3 feet, bred four youngsters, who
left the flight two days after leaving the nest, and were herded back by anxious parents
towards the late afternoon. I now have nine with two pairs nesting, and I have
heard of a further pair, which I thought to be lost, nesting in the eaves of a nearby
house. The furthest distance which has been reported to me is two miles from
their aviary, and due to their habit of continually calling on the wing, I have had
numerous reports up to one mile, including a telephone call to say that three were
sitting on the siren of the local fire station.
Their flight home is now very straight, and with purpose, and since I am moving
house to about three miles away, I wonder if I can keep them to new quarters.

" MARKED WHITE " ZEBRA FINCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910924461538461" page_id="56238318"  page_num="150" year="" vol="">
In the September-October issue of the Avicultural Journal there appears an article
on the recent arrival at Keston of the Marked White Zebra Finch.
In his article Mr. Boosey has changed the name of the Australian bred Marked
White Zebra Finch to the Chestnut-flanked Zebra Finch, yet he states that the
name " Marked White " describes them tolerably well.
So as to keep names uniform it is suggested that the country of origin should be
consulted as to the desirability of a change of name.
As this variety is well established in Australia, and is known throughout as the
" Marked White ", a change of name now would only add to the confusion that
already exists through the multiple naming of birds.
Wishing the Avicultural Magazine every success.

One very interesting bird which Sir Edward has bred, and that came out of the
nest while I was away, is a hen Eclectus with a yellow and orange head. The wings
and side feathers have the appearance of a patchwork quilt, some of the feathers
having a normal maroon colour, whilst the other feathers have the appearance of
being yellow mixed with maroon. The head of the bird, though mainly yellow and
orange, also has a few flecks of red feathers in it. The hen Eclectus usually has a
black bill, but with this bird it is noticed that there is quite a lot of yellow in the bill.
The bird is strong and vigorous, although a little more timid than the usual young
Eclectus.
Sir Edward hopes to photograph this bird in colour to enable him to check the
colours as each moult takes place.

The Blue Robins had five eggs in the first nest, and young hatched on 22nd June
--cannot say how many, but judging by the vast quantity of live insects carried to
the nest, and the excreta brought out by the old birds and " dumped " on the door
frame (the same spot as used last year for this purpose), I should say there must be
at least four lusty youngsters.
Although both parents are kept well occupied feeding this family, the cock has
found time recently to encourage the hen to build a second nest, which she has now
completed in a box in the flight, and I think she will be laying again in a day or so.
I am a little disturbed by these " rush tactics " in case the second nest hatch before
the first lot are independent. It would be amazing if the cock continued to feed the
older family and the newly-hatched young at the same time.

Later postscript. --The Blue Robins have four young on the wing and a further
five eggs. One egg from the first nest was infertile and was thrown out into the soft
ground. The Cedar Waxwing promptly " adopted " it and has been brooding
it on the floor where it fell !

THE CEYLON BLUE MAGPIE
Cissa ornata (Wagler)
By G. M. Henry (Church Enstone, Oxon, England)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999336" page_id="56238325"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
This bird is confined to Ceylon, its relatives of the same genus being
found no nearer than the Himalayas and Indo-Malayan countries ; it
is therefore an interesting example of discontinuous distribution. In
the pear-shaped island of Ceylon a great mountain massif, rising to
8,000 feet, occupies the centre of the southern half. Owing to the
action of the monsoon winds, the southern and western aspects of these
mountains and their foothills receive a heavy and well-distributed
rainfall (80 to 250 inches annually), and it is this wet zone which
constitutes the habitat of the Blue Magpie ; it is found from a few
hundred feet up to nearly the highest point in the Island. Unfortu-
nately, during the last century, the demands of tea and rubber cultiva-
tion have depleted the once-extensive forests of this region, restricting
the bird's range very severely.
A forest-loving bird, it usually dwells in small flocks of less than a
dozen except in the breeding season, when pairs or solitary birds are
frequently met with. It moves about a good deal, a flock seldom
being found for many consecutive days in the same area. They keep
in touch with each other by a great variety of loud calls, most of which
have a harsh or rasping quality. Some of these are described in my
notes as follows : " a ringing, metallic crink, crink-rink suggestive of
jingling a gigantic bunch of keys " ; " crak crak rak rak rak --a loud,
rasping sound " ; " a sharp, harsh qui qui " ; " crikrak " ; " twiwi-craa
---a as in hat ". Besides these calls, low conversational notes--squeaks,
croaks, chatterings, and sucking noises--are uttered by members of
a feeding flock, and a solitary individual will express its feelings in
a quaint subsong into which it introduces excellent imitations of the
notes of other birds--the scream of the Serpent Eagle, rattle of the
Scimitar Babbler, etc.--all in subdued tones.
The Blue Magpie feeds on both fruit and animal food, but much
prefers the latter. It partakes of the fruit of Freycinetia, a small screw-

pine which clothes the tree-trunks in its haunts. Small vertebrates,
such as lizards and tree-frogs, are eagerly sought, and many insects, of
which beetles, tree-crickets, and caterpillars appear to be the favourites.
Hairy caterpillars are methodically rubbed on mossy branches--
presumably to divest them of stinging hairs--before being swallowed.
In hunting it is very active and agile, searching foliage most thoroughly,
and often adopting attitudes worthy of a tit in the process. All levels
of the forest, from ground to tree-canopy, come within its purview.
The flight is rather weak and laboured ; the beautiful, graduated
tail is carried closed and strap-like, except in vol-planing when it is
widely spread. In flying any distance, the bird tends to drop from its
perch to within a few feet of the ground, rising again at the end of
its flight.
Moulting takes place in August and September. The breeding
season is in the early part of the year. The nest--which has seldom
been found--is built in a well-concealed site among foliage near the
top of a tree in jungle. It is built of twigs in the shape of a crow's nest,
with a deep cavity lined with soft roots or " old man's beard " lichen ;
the latter abundantly festoons the trees of the mountain forests. The
three to five eggs are described as pale greenish-blue or whitish,
heavily mottled with grey and brown.
So far as I am aw r are, the only Ceylon Blue Magpie that has been
kept in captivity was one given to me in September, 1943, by Mr.
Ralph West with whom I was staying. His tea-estate in the mountains,
4-5,000 feet, was in the best area for Cissa ornata known to me. It was
partly surrounded by virgin forest, and a stream--rapid and bouldery
--traversing the estate was bordered on both sides by a strip of jungle.
This belt of trees was a favourite resort of a flock of Blue Magpies and
offered exceptionally favourable opportunities for watching them.
Coolies working in the neighbouring tea-field found one amongst the
tea bushes and managed to capture it by throwing a cs cumbly " (coarse
woollen blanket carried by every estate labourer) over it. In the
process the bird lost its tail completely ; it was in heavy moult about
the head, thin, and generally in poor condition, but seemed uninjured
and worth taking some trouble over. A tea-plucker's basket was soon
fitted with a perch and sacking cover, and in it " Cissy " spent the next
few days until she could be taken to Colombo where more spacious
quarters were available. Her feeding presented some difficulties, and
much time had to be devoted to hunting frogs and lizards, beetles and
grasshoppers--for her appetite proved to be quite unimpaired by her
adventures. Once installed in a large cage in Colombo she throve,
tamed quickly, grew a new tail, and became a delightful pet. She lived
in captivity for three years, the last one in the Colombo Zoo at Dehi-
wela. The greater part of her domesticated life was spent at Jaffna in
the north of the Island, in a climate very different from her natural

abode--hot, dry except for two or three months of the year, and at
sea-level ; in spite of this she maintained, in general, excellent health.
A holiday upcountry, however--contrary to expectations--gave her
little pleasure ; she lost condition, and on returning to Jaffna, fell ill
and got so low that her life was despaired of. Brandy and milk, ad-
ministered at frequent intervals in tiny sips, eventually restored her to
health. Normally her diet consisted of bread and milk, scraps of raw
meat, lizards, grasshoppers, and fruit such as bananas and pawpaw.
On one occasion, when she was sharing a large aviary with a peacock
and a pair of Great Stone Plovers, her predatory nature revealed
itself; a Spotted Dove was unthinkingly introduced into the company
and Cissy lost no time in pouncing on it ; only the promptest of action
saving its life. Although, in the absence of companions of her own kind,
she refrained from uttering the noisy calls above-mentioned, she
indulged in the subsong during her afternoon siesta, including in it
a beautiful imitation of the chok chaw-choyik of a distant Jungle-Cock,
which she must have learnt in her native forests in her youth. She was
fond of bathing, and always became lively and talkative in rainy
weather which seemed to have a tonic effect.
Although known as " Cissy ", and hereinbefore treated as of the sex
appropriate to that name, no proof exists that " she " was indeed a
hen ; the sexes are practically indistinguishable in this bird.
Regarding the " expectation of life " of the Ceylon Blue Magpie as
a species, I am pessimistic. As already mentioned, the beautiful
indigenous forests of the mountains and wet zone foothills are steadily
being whittled away on one pretext or another, and are now but a
pitiful fragment of their former extent. Protective laws exist for certain
rare and beautiful birds, Cissa among them, but will and power to
enforce them are absent, no real public opinion on such matters exists,
and protective laws will be useless if the bird's essential habitat be
destroyed. Reafforestation in the hills consists mostly of the replace-
ment of primeval forest with plantations of exotic trees--eucalypts,
acacias, and conifers--which offer no harbourage to any of the more
interesting of Ceylon's endemic species. It is true that " Wild-life
Sanctuaries " and " Strict Natural Reserves " exist--and look very
well on paper--but they are neither sufficiently extensive nor sacro-
sanct to ensure the survival of a relict fauna. Unless the remains of
the natural hill forests are rigorously preserved, both from official
exploitation and the insidious process of illicit sapling-cutting and
firewood stealing, I have personally no doubt that a very few genera-
tions hence will see this beautiful bird--and several other species which
inhabit the same area--added to the sorry list of birds lost to our
posterity by man's greed, lack of foresight, and thoughtlessness.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
These notes are, in part, a continuation of my previous article
(Goodwin, 1953) to which readers are referred for descriptions of the
appearance, behaviour, and display of the species. The Spring of 1953
found me with only four Lanceolated Jays, the males Green and
Yellow (birds are named according to colour of their rings), and the
females Blue and White. The female Red got out in February and
soon vanished, probably having been killed by some predator. Of
the four remaining, the male Green is, and was, the tamest ; he is
very steady, has little fear of strange people, and will freely perform
all his innate behaviour patterns within a few feet of me. At one
time he was subordinate to Yellow, but since he gained dominance
over him in June, 1952, he has retained it. Yellow is less tame and
rather more jumpy and nervous. The female White is the shyest
of all, but even she will behave quite normally within a couple of
yards of me if I am still or moving quietly. Blue, in contrast to the
others, who are all splendid specimens of their kind, is rather small
and dingy in colour. She has what seems to be the garruline
equivalent of that captious self-assertiveness that is apt to be correlated
with sub-average stature in another species of vertebrate. She is
quite as tame as Green, in the sense that she will come as near to me,
but is very prone to take alarm, or offence, and to start scolding.
She invariably does this if I look into any bush or tree in the aviary,
and even to glance towards a possible nesting site or to search the
ground vegetation for Partridges' nests will often elicit her harsh
screams of disapproval. The others usually ignore this hysterical
behaviour, although if she is particularly excited her cries and gestures

will sometimes evoke a similar, but less intense, response in them.
I can only assume that she does this because such behaviour on my
part " suggests " a nest- or roost-seeking predator to her, although
if so it is rather strange that it should extend even to ground vegetation
in which the species would be most unlikely ever to breed or sleep.
All four birds spent the winter of 1952-53 in an outdoor aviary
about 30 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet high. The only shelter consisted
of roofing felt, covering certain parts of the roof under which were
strategically arranged perches, but although freely availing themselves
of these by day the Jays all preferred to roost among the foliage of
two Cupressus trees. In early March it became apparent that Blue,
instead of pairing with Yellow, had set her cap at the " married "
male Green. He showed no Macheathian embarrassment at the
presence of two rivals for his favours, and when in courtship-feeding
mood bestowed his gifts on whichever hen happened to be nearest.
As soon as I realized the state of affairs I moved Yellow and Blue
to a slightly smaller aviary some way--but not far enough--away.
Green and White displayed and indulged in courtship-feeding
throughout the Spring, but showed no serious nesting behaviour.
This I think was White's fault, as her mate began a nest, which never
got beyond the foundation stage, and I feel sure he would have built
properly had the female shown interest.
Yellow also started a nest which was never completed. So far
as I could see he and Blue were never really paired. At odd times
one of them would make sexual advances towards the other, some-
times very fervently, but they never seemed to reach any sort of
mutual " rapport ". I think this was probably due to Blue's matri-
monial ambitions still being centred on Green, whom she could,
unfortunately, both see and hear.
When they started to moult the four were reunited in the large
aviary, where they remained until early April, 1954. Once again the
two hens had both bestowed their favours on Green. Blue was the
dominant female, and had begun to make occasional attacks on her
rival. This she was most prone to do, not when White was being-
paid attentions by the male, but immediately after she herself had
been fed by him. In view of White's record, I decided to leave Blue
with the favoured male, thinking that, poorish specimen though she
was by comparison, she could hardly prove worse than White had
done so far as reproduction was concerned.
On 18th April I moved Yellow and White to an aviary only a few
feet away. This was done in the expectation that if the birds were
fairly close the display of any one would be seen by, and perhaps
help to give reproductive stimulation to, those in the adjoining aviary.
As will be seen, these expectations were fulfilled, though not in the
manner hoped for. Blue and Green left together continued to indulge

in much courtship-feeding. Prior to this Green had carried odd
twigs and fibres to various possible nest-sites and in one--a smallish
wire-netting " nest-bowl 53 fixed high up (but lopsided) under the
roof--had constructed a slight and very rough nest-foundation. Both
birds, however, spent much time flying restlessly to and fro, due I
feared rather to a desire to get out and seek a more congenial nesting
place than to any innate urge to exercise their wings. On the 23rd
I noticed to my great joy that a lot more sticks had been added to the
nest. Progress on it evidently continued on the 24th, and on the
25th (a Sunday when I was at home) the birds spent most of the
morning selecting fibrous roots and taking them to line the nest.
To my surprise they both did this freely in my presence. Blue--
who was then quite prepared to tolerate me in the aviary so long
as I did not look at any " forbidden areas "--coming eagerly near
to my feet to sort over the roots I threw down, in great contrast to the
shyness which White had shown when nesting two years before.
Some more work was done on the nest that afternoon, but no further
building was observed, and I think the nest was finished on the 25th.
On the 26th and 27th Blue spent much time sitting on the nest, and
Green frequently fed her there. On 29th April, Blue went on the
nest at dawn, and sat for most of the day, coming off for a long period
in the afternoon and several shorter spells. I thought she must have
laid but when I felt in the nest at 9 a.m. on the 30th, it was empty.
The horrible idea occurred to me that she might be laying an egg
each morning, and then eating or hiding it. After some indecision,
I decided to try to remove the next egg so as to save at least one of
the clutch if my fears were justified. Next morning I flushed Blue
at 8 a.m. (she sat very tight and once off mobbed me more vehemently
than she ever had before) and took a fresh-laid egg from the nest.
This I placed under my old hen Common Jay, who was then incubating
her own eggs, replacing Blue's egg with a Common Jay's. Needless
to say, all this created a great deal of " alarm and despondency " so
far as Blue was concerned, but she returned to her nest and proved
my suspicions of her false by having two intact eggs in her nest the
following morning. It is interesting that she had had a sort of " dress
rehearsal " for the laying of her eggs from at least two days before
the first was in fact laid. It will be recalled, however, by those who
read my previous article that the female White behaved in this way
on the day prior to that on which she laid, as Common Jays also
sometimes do.
Blue sat very tightly, coming off the nest to bathe, preen, and exercise
just before dusk and also, usually for shorter spells, at other times
during the day. Green fed her attentively both on and off the nest.
Their behaviour was similar to that previously described (Goodwin,
1953) f* r Green and White, except that Blue, both before and during

incubation often received or solicited food with appeal calls, or the
chirruping notes, and when she used the juvenile begging note she
did so much less intensely. Green now showed the same animosity
towards wild Jackdaws that my Common Jays always do when they
have eggs or young, attacking them furiously through the wire when-
ever they alighted on the aviary. He spent much of his spare time
" in communication " with the exiled White, reinforcing her con-
viction that she was his and his alone, to my great annoyance. But
of this more anon.
To my sorrow the egg put under the Common Jay proved infertile
as, presumably, were two of the three under Blue. On the evening of
10th May there were still three eggs in the nest, but at 7 a.m. on the
19th, one young one had just hatched. It was naked and hideous
and so far as I could see in a very hurried look, it seemed slightly
deeper pink in colour than a newly-hatched Common Jay. But this
may have been imagination, since I did not risk a close inspection.
With Blue's hysterical curses ringing in my ears, I beat a hasty retreat,
fearing that I might already have done enough to cause disaster.
If, as seems likely, the only fertile egg was the last of the clutch, then
the incubation period is 16 days, about the same as in our native
species. In this connection it might be mentioned that although the
Lanceolated Jay is much smaller than the Common Jay, its egg is
only slightly so. Indeed, only by closely comparing size plus the
slight (individual) colour differences when the eggs were lying side
by side on my hand, could I be sure " which was which " of the eggs
in the mixed clutch I had manufactured. Blue sat very tight for
several days after the young bird hatched. I only risked occasional
quick glances, with the aid of a mirror, at the young bird when she
was off the nest. This invariably aroused her to a frenzy of mobbing.
Finally, on 1st June, she screwed her courage up to the point of actual
physical attack, swooping from behind and striking the back of my
head. This she repeated on most subsequent occasions when I entered
the aviary. To my surprise Green showed no overt resentment of
my presence. Particularly amusing was the way in which he would
calmly continue gathering, preparing, and engorging food for the
young one without the slightest sign of anxiety, whilst his mate was
" yelling her head off". As is the case with the Common Jay (Good-
win, 1951) the male bird at first prepared all largish or hard-bodied
insects (such as mealworms) by carefully pulling them to pieces and
discarding the harder parts before engorging them, when he was
feeding the young one, although he had taken no such trouble when
merely feeding the hen on the nest. He took ant pupae and meal-
worms readily, also cockchafers and some lean meat when the young
one was a few days old (they were not offered before), but refused to
take greenfly, small beetles, or centipedes. When given leafy branches,

he would at once fly to them and search eagerly for caterpillars. Since
caterpillars were few but greenfly many, I had thought and hoped
the latter might prove acceptable, but no matter how thick they were
on the branches, he ignored them. On reflection it occurred to me
that the only birds I have ever seen eating these insects--which,
unlike most others, could be procured in any number without search
or trouble--are the House Sparrow and the phylloscopine warblers.

at the young one. On 3rd June it was about half-feathered and lay
in the nest, crouched immobile and gaping in fear in response to its
mother's alarm cries. By this time my visits to the nest had resulted
in Blue usually beginning to screech at me and to attack as soon as
I entered the aviary. On 8th June the young one was fully feathered
and was perched on the edge of the nest. For about a week previously
Blue had spent much time off the nest, although still brooding the
big youngster for about 50 per cent of the time and roosting on the
nest at night. I think the young one first left the immediate vicinity
of the nest on the morning of 11th June, when it was 23 days old.
At 7 a.m. that morning it was hopping and scrambling about among
some branches at the opposite end of the aviary. Green, like some
anxious but rather incompetent human father in charge of a toddler,
fussed nervously around it, oblivious of me, but Blue's only concern
was the danger I represented and she mobbed me vehemently and
unceasingly. Her behaviour was very similar to that recorded of the
Beechey Jay (Cyanolyca beecheyi ) when breeding in captivity (Sutcliffe,
1926). On the 12th the young bird was seen to be able to fly (with
the usual rather fluttering and awkward flight of fledgeling passerines)
from branch to branch without losing height. It returned to the
nest edge to roost that night, and has done so since. This no doubt
is due to its being a high and sheltered perch rather than to any innate
tendency to use the nest for roosting after having once left it. At the
moment of writing (15th June, 1954) the young bird is still spending
most of its time in cover, although it can and does fly quite com-
petently about the aviary. I think both parents are feeding it,
although, owing no doubt to Blue's mistrust of me, I have only seen
the male doing so. Unfortunately it is more influenced by its mother's
warnings than by its father's indifference where I am concerned.
It freezes as soon as Blue starts to screech, and when I approach it
closely it hops and flutters away through the branches, using every
time it pauses the same jerking " flight-intention " movements that
an adult Jay does when mobbing. I am hoping that its present con-
viction that " mother knows best " will be ousted by experience to
the contrary, as usually happens with juvenile Homo sapiens. Its
hunger call is harsher, but at the same time higher-pitched than that
of a young Common Jay, and as it is fed subsides into a similar eager
gabble which is, I suppose, caused by the bird trying to call out and
swallow at the same time.
The young one is a pale and rather dull edition of its parents, with
shorter crest and the black and white markings on the secondaries
less distinct. In one respect it differs from the specimens of juvenile
G. lanceolatus in the British Museum. These all have the blue parts
of the wings and tail of a pale bluish-grey, but in my bird they are
of a similar azure blue as the adult. The skins in question are,

however, all of older juveniles, and it is possible that the blue on my
bird will fade to greyish later. On the other hand the food may affect
the colouring. In the Common Jay unsuitable food may result in
abnormal colouring of the juvenile plumage which is, however, in
such cases always duller than the normal. Brightness of the blue
parts seems to be a certain sign that food is suitable and feathering
will be normal. My juvenile Lanceolated Jay shows every sign of
being fit, and I take the brightness of its blue parts as a hopeful rather
than a warning sign. Its bill and legs are a pale pinkish or fleshy
grey instead of the grey of the adult. Its eyes appear a similar colour
(dark brown), but I have not examined them at very close quarters.
The skin of the eye-rims is paler and more conspicuous than in the
adult, in which it is hardly visible.
Since the young one left the nest the pair have indulged in a good
deal of courtship-feeding--although this never entirely dropped out--
and Green displays a lot to his mate. He has shown signs of wishing
to copulate, and has made frequent sudden attacks on Blue, which
I think are caused by anger at his sexual impulses being thwarted.

D. GOODWIN--LANCEOLATED JAYS BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY 1 6 I
Yellow and White in the other aviary have wasted the entire season.
This was due primarily to White's faithfulness to Green. Despite
barriers of wire netting and the constant sight and sound of her loved
one bestowing his affections elsewhere, she remained
" True as the dial to the sun,
Although it be not shined upon "
to her first love and ignored or evaded Yellow's early tentative
advances. Whenever she heard Green offering to feed Blue she would
fly to the nearest point of her aviary, cling to the wire, and call
imploringly to him. Often at the same time Yellow, prepared food
in his gullet, would be flying back and forth vainly giving the food-
offering call. Had White ever " asked " him to feed her, I have
little doubt he would have responded gladly, but she never did.
Green, as has been hinted, was largely responsible for this state of
affairs. Although when Blue was with him he had time for no one
else, whilst she was on the nest he did not scruple to seek feminine
company elsewhere. In fact he spent the greater part of his ample
spare time on the perch nearest to White's aviary, his notes and
actions leaving neither her nor I in any doubt about his feelings
towards her. The birds have now (17th June) begun to moult, so it is
too late to hope for any last minute change of heart between White
and Yellow.
This breeding season has certainly been a case of " third time
lucky ", although as Green and Blue have proved such exemplary
parents, it is the more annoying that three of their four eggs should
have been sterile. This was undoubtedly Blue's fault, as I repeatedly
saw her sidle or fly away when Green wished to copulate. Presumably
her physical reproductive processes were a little ahead of the psycho-
logical ones that should have kept time with them. The two pre-
sumably infertile eggs remained in the nest for at least five days, but
had gone on the ninth day. Evidently this bird, like the Common
Jay, does not remove intact eggs until the young are well grown.
Probably in both cases the eggs are removed only subsequent to the
young breaking them.
Food Given to the Young
Since my feeding methods seem to have been successful, I give them
for what they are worth. This could no doubt be improved upon by
anyone with more cash or leisure. For the first two days after hatching
I fed the male bird with fresh ant larvae and pupae (Formica rufa) or
mealworms or caterpillars, but mostly ant pupae, every hour or so.
Thereafter I had to be away from home most of the day, and the
regime was as follows :---
5 a.m. Fresh ant pupae (about a dessertspoonful) given to male.
5.30 a.m. Leafy branches, with caterpillars on them, strewn on

floor of aviary (the male always searched these eagerly, but owing to
the poor crop of caterpillars locally, I think he seldom got more than
four or five at most).
7 a.m. Dish filled with mealworms to last day.

<bodyText confidence="0.996413413793103" page_id="56238336"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
After the first three days cockchafers were sometimes substituted
for ant pupae at the early morning feed. Three or four times during
the period that the young bird was in the nest I gave the male shreds
of lean beef which he fed to it. He probably caught some insects
for himself in the aviary, and at least once he caught a mouse. The
non-insect foods on the adult Jays' menu--wholemeal bread, peanuts,
sop, etc.--were also given to some extent, but they were not, I think,
used for the young one, except perhaps as a stop-gap, at least up to
the time of its leaving the nest.
Note. --The diagrammatic sketches are merely intended to give a
general impression of the birds, and have no pretensions to accuracy
of detail. Nor are they quite to scale.
PS. --Those with experience of the ill fortune that so often dogs the
aviculturist will not be surprised to learn that the above story has
an chappy ending. On 21st June, the young bird seeming now past
all likely mishap, I ventured to go away on a short holiday. When
I returned on ist July, I learned to my horror that the kind neighbour
who looked after the Jays in my absence had found it dead that very
morning. It had been fit and well the evening before, and when found
had severe wounds on its head which had cracked the skull. Pre-
sumably an Owl or some other predator must somehow have managed
to seize it through the wire. The only slight consolation is that it
did not die of any illness that I might have forestalled had I been at
home, and since the bird was in every way fit and active previously,
there is no reason to think the regime was at fault.
As the old Norse saying has it :
One's enemies one can overcome,
God one can bribe,
But against bad luck no man can do anything.

BREEDING OF GLOSSY BLACK COCKATOOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979854476190476" page_id="56238337"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
By Sir Edward Hallstrom (Willoughby, N.S.W., Australia)
The Glossy Black Cockatoo is the only Black Cockatoo that has
proved really too difficult for the ordinary aviculturist or the
amateur to raise from the baby stage after being taken from the nest.
The feeding is so highly specialized that they gradually lose weight
when given ordinary food. I had some failures until I commenced
experimenting with matured birds to see if I could produce substitute
food. It was no use putting food before them, they would starve
themselves to death unless, of course, they were given food they were
used to--the seed of the Casuarina tree. This is not easy, as for
many years, particularly around Sydney, the wood of this particular
tree (which burns with a great heat) has been used for bakers' ovens.
Its use is now being replaced with newer methods of baking bread,
but the inroads on the trees were so considerable that it was hard to
locate the seed anywhere near to Sydney.
The seed is contained in a hard cone, and it is very difficult to
extract it from the cone. Even when the seed has been extracted the
birds will politely refuse to eat it--they must tear the cone to pieces
themselves. This is tremendously important, as their mandibles have
been especially designed by nature for dealing with the cones. If the
birds do take to softer foods, such as sunflower seed, maize, etc., their
top bill begins to extend, the bottom grows out in two long horns, and
is very soon of no use to the bird whatever. It will be understood,
therefore, that this was a real problem. As previously stated, in my
experimental work I used matured birds, giving them just sufficient
of the cones to keep their bills in trim, and fed them on a mixture of
canary seed flour, plus peanut butter, and peanut oil. This was
administered directly into the crop by means of a syringe and a rubber
tube that was pushed down the throat. This could be accomplished
with the greatest of ease provided, of course, one knew how to handle
the bird.
My aim was to induce the creature to eat sunflower seed, or canary
seed. Canary seed was useless, as it did not have sufficient oil, but
the oily content of the sunflower seed made it more suitable. I calcu-
lated that if sunflower seed, plus some Casuarina nuts daily to keep
their mandibles in trim, were used, it might be possible to keep these
birds in captivity. The experiments were carried out over six years.
Eventually a satisfactory method was found, and the birds now do well
on the before-mentioned diet. Unfortunately, they cannot be tempted
to eat any other type of food.
In my aviaries there are nine of these birds, and to feed them it is
necessary for a man to drive, every day, into the country to gather

fresh nuts. Two separate aviaries were set up with a nice pair in each
and suitable hollow logs were provided. One pair were noticed
mating, but the other pair, although friendly, did not appear interested.
Suddenly the latter pair produced one egg. Several days later another.
The female sat closely, and in twenty-nine days hatched one chick.
It was then noticed that the male was losing condition, and I am
convinced that he had been starving himself in the feeding of the
female who rarely emerged from the log. This really was a desperate
position. After very careful observations, I decided to remove the
male, and found he had really lost a lot of condition. It was necessary
to recommence feeding him by injecting canary seed flour plus peanut
oil directly into the crop. In a few days he was showing good progress,
and was returned intermittently to the mother and youngster. It
again appeared as though the double feeding was too much for him
and although, at this stage, he had an ample supply of Casuarina
cones, I found it necessary to remove him again.
At the moment of writing (1st June, 1954), the baby is over two
weeks old and is being well cared for by the mother. The father,
who is still separated from the female and the youngster, is now doing
well again. A peep into the nest hollow this morning revealed a
fluffy cream-coloured youngster about the size of one's closed fist.
I am sure that this is the first time ever that one has been hatched in
captivity. They are really a lovely bird, and I think it will be
remembered in my talk in Sweden I described them as a Cockatoo
which does not have a gizzard, similar to the other Black Cockatoos.
As feeding is so highly specialized and consists of a great amount
of oil, it makes it most difficult to solve the problem of keeping them
in captivity, let alone the successful nesting and producing of a
youngster. From all appearances, the youngster is doing so well I
am sure it will be successfully reared.
Additional note, 25th June.--The young Glossy Black Cockatoo is
doing exceptionally well. It is in faultless condition (the mother
having done all the feeding) and is now almost fully feathered and
shows itself at the entrance to the nest. I did not return the male
to his mate for fear of disturbing the progress the mother had made
with the rearing of this singularly glorious youngster.
Further additional note, 20th August.--The Glossy Black Cockatoo
has now left the nest, and is accompanying its mother to the food
containers, and I should say has been successfully reared by the mother
alone. The youngster has a considerable amount of down protruding-
through the now matured feathers on the head. The down is quite
long and gives the bird an attractive appearance.

By W. G. Osman Hill (London, England)
In 1951 (Avicultural Magazine, 57, p, 37), I recorded an
example of longevity in a Blue-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva ). This
individual, a male, had an authentic life of at least 50 years. Since
then two other instances of aged Blue-fronts have come to my notice,
and in one of them the history is as well evidenced as one ever hopes to
get. Both far exceed my previous record. I give the protocols here-

to have been in possession of immediate past owner for 42 years and
in the same family before that for 37 years. Total 97 years. Post-
mortem revealed the usual senile degenerative features.
2. No. BP 275, female, received from owner 21st July, 1954 ;
weight 450 gm. Last owner had known the bird personally for 25
years, but it had been in his possession for only 9^- years. It had
previously been in the possession of his wife's aunt, who had kept it
for 19 years. This lady had received it originally from an old lady of
80, to whom it had been given as a present when she was 10 years old.
Total age of bird, if the history is reliable--98^ years.
The owner had subjected the bird to euthanasia on account of its
progressive weakness and loss of appetite. Post-mortem revealed the
usual cardio-vascular degenerations, together with an abscess in the
basal lobe of the right lung.
It is interesting to note the close correspondence in the total period
of captivity in these two birds. This possibly represents, within a year
or so, the potential longevity for this species. If this is the case, then
Flower's (1925) statement to the effect that " a parrot, under favour-
able circumstances, may live to 20 years, though certain individuals
have been known to live for over 50 years " needs revision.
Flower's oldest psittacine bird with reliable documentation was
a Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (Kakatoe galerita) of 51 years, but
Aspinall (1933) recorded a well authenticated example of the same
species as being accidentally killed after 109 years in captivity. A
traditional record of 137 years 10 months for the same species is given
by Hamerton (1943).

Among the birds which generally cause a lot of trouble as far as the
food is concerned, the Woodpeckers can certainly be mentioned first.
Many aviculturists have indeed tried to keep these birds in good
condition in captivity but, apart from a few exceptions, with very
poor results. Although some fanciers have managed to keep one or
more of these birds for some time, it cannot be said that they did so
with entire success.
Now chance has brought us a way of feeding these birds, which up
to the present has given us complete satisfaction, and therefore we
wish to communicate this to our fellow-aviculturists, trusting that it
will be of some use to them in taking care of their feathered pets.
Early last year, we were informed that a sailor had brought from
abroad a very beautiful, finely coloured bird, of which he knew neither
the name nor the country of origin. It lived mainly on fruit (oranges
and bananas), and some insects.
We hastened to have a look at the bird, and found that we had to
do with a Melanerpes Jlavifrons (Vieillot), i.e. a Golden-fronted Wood-
pecker from Southern Brazil and Paraguay.
It was a rather lively bird, which did not seem to have suffered
very much from the long voyage. We soon struck a bargain, and we
were able to add this new species to our collection. The bird having
come into our possession quite unexpectedly, we had not been able
to prepare a suitable cage. So we were forced to house it provision-
ally in the cage of a couple of Nectarinia famosa (Lin.), in which we
had quickly erected a fragment of a tree trunk, so that the bird could
perch at ease.
After the arrival of the new guest, both it and the Sunbirds
fluttered anxiously around the cage for a short while, but they very
quickly settled down, and were visibly satisfied that each of them
could go its own way without caring too much about its companions.
After having observed the Woodpecker for a couple of hours, during
which time it swallowed some fifteen mealworms and pecked greedily
at the orange, we left the birds to themselves, fully convinced that
things were going as smoothly as could be expected. Next day every-
thing was going on just as perfectly, but in the afternoon the keeper
informed us that our Woodpecker was drinking the liquid food of
the Sunbirds, i.e. the food of the Nectaridae. We were of course
surprised, but the news pleased us enormously, because we hoped
that this would be a way to give our new acquisition more varied food.
We placed a few more drinking troughs in the cage, and awaited
further developments with interest. After one week we were quite

sure that the liquid food, intended for our Nectaridae, had also
become the main food of the M. flavifrons. The bird is always quite
ready to swallow some ten mealworms, but it completely disregards
all fruit since it has tasted the Nectaridae food.
We have also tried this liquid food with a Hoopoe, and found
that this species accepts it quite willingly as well, but does not consider
it as its main food. Since we have given it our liquid mixture, the
health of the bird has, however, considerably improved.
The birds are still in excellent health, and we should be glad to
learn from other aviculturists whether they have already had some
experience with liquid food.
Our liquid food for Nectaridae consists of:--Water, i litre ;
glucose, 75 grams ; liquid honey, 120 grams ; condensed milk,

ban, the most frequently imported of the small group of Amazons
having white or pink on the face and throat, and a rather dark green
body colour is, nevertheless, a rare species in captivity.
It is a very handsome bird of a rich darkish green, yellowish on the
tail-coverts. The forehead is white, while the cheeks, and a large but
somewhat irregular patch on the throat, are of a beautiful deep coral
pink. The feathers of the forepart of the body are bordered with black,
the width of the borders increasing in the region of the head and neck
and upper part of the breast. Behind the pink cheeks is an area of very
dark slate grey. There is some wine colour on the abdomen and the
tail is yellowish-green, the outer feathers having a large red patch near
the base. The outer webs of the flights are rich Prussian blue. The bill
is whitish and the legs oatmeal colour. Total length twelve inches or
a little over. The bird has the appearance of being slightly smaller
and slimmer than a Blue-front.
I do not find them particularly easy to sex, but I should say that
hens have a slightly smaller and more irregular area of pink on the
throat, but a rather larger and more extensive area of vinous on the
abdomen.
During the brief period of the lifting of the parrot ban, we received
six of these Amazons at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm. Two of them
died--one from a fit, and the other through an accident--but the
remaining four have done extremely well.

E. BOOSEY-CUBAN AMAZON PARROT
As I believe they have the reputation of being somewhat delicate,
their aviary shelter was heated during their first winter. Since then,
however, they have wintered successfully without heat, though it should
perhaps be added that their aviary is in a very sheltered position,
facing due south. Only during the winter months, however, are they
shut into the shelter each night.
They are delightful aviary birds, being strong fliers, and altogether
very lively and active. They are also very vocal, uttering both morning
and evening a wonderful medley of typically Amazonian cries.
These, however, while very attractive when heard from a distance
out of doors, might prove rather deafening indoors, and this is one
reason why I think these Amazons more suited to aviary than cage life.
If they have a disadvantage, it is that they are so terribly shy and
wild.
For weeks they became completely panic-stricken if one went
anywhere near their aviary, but now at last they have calmed down
a bit, and one bold spirit--a male I think--will actually take a slice
of apple from my fingers, watched apprehensively in the background
by what I take to be his wife, who obviously considers it a most risky
proceeding ! The other two think it more prudent to retreat at once
into the shelter, until all danger is past.
Cuban Amazons have a curious display which consists of the male
thrusting forward and slightly lowering his wings, thus bringing into
prominence the wonderful blue in the flights and, at the same time,
making a sort of mock-serious token lunge at the female.
Their seed mixture should consist mainly of sunflower, with a few
monkey nuts, and a little canary, groats, and hemp. Twice a week
we give ours a few cubes of stale bread, previously soaked in sweetened,
slightly watered milk. As to fruit and green food, Cubans are very fond
of apple, and also of spinach beet, particularly the fleshy stalks of the
Seacale variety.
They have the reputation of possessing but little aptitude for
learning to talk.
As far as I know Cuban Amazons have never been bred in captivity,
but there is a Continental record of the breeding of a hybrid between
this species and a Blue-fronted Amazon.
The accompanying photograph of two of our Cubans at Keston was
taken by my partner Mr. Brooksbank only with the greatest difficulty.
At first, alarmed by the appearance of a camera in their aviary, none
of them would stay still for a second. Eventually, however, after con-
siderable patience on the part of the photographer, two of them
remained still just long enough for this photograph to be taken.

In the past birds have been classified largely on the basis of their
structures and colours, but recently there has been a growing tendency
to analyse the relationships between bird species by also making
particular use of the specific behaviour patterns exhibited by them.
The best conditions for behaviour studies of this sort are undoubtedly
those in which large numbers of closely related species are kept in
captivity in cages or, preferably, aviaries. For, as Konrad Lorenz
(1954) has pointed out, when one is making a detailed inventory of
all the specific behaviour actions of a number of species of birds, one
has to live with them day after day over a long period of time. Lorenz
has even gone so far as to say that " it is really impossible to gain the
necessary knowledge by observing animals in the wild state Many
field ornithologists will disagree with this, but I feel that it depends
on the type of study one is making. If, as Lorenz was doing with his
ducks, you are studying a large number of closely related species,
then the possibility of slight distortions of behaviour resulting from the
conditions of captivity will only be a small disadvantage, for the
time and labour involved in travelling all over the world to observe
the many species in the group under investigation, would make such
a study exceedingly difficult. If, on the other hand, you are making a
detailed study of one species, then it is probably better to study it in
its natural habitat, as Niko Tinbergen (1953) has done with the
Herring Gull.
The earlier investigators, who were interested in classifying bird
species, were able to carry out most of their work in museums, with
hundreds of skins of birds arrayed on their desks. But they overlooked
the fact that to classify living things on the basis of dead objects
involves a serious omission !--namely, of course, behaviour. Now-
adays, as the result of the work of such pioneers as Heinroth, Whitman,
and Lorenz, specific behaviour characters are treated with the same
respect as structural characters, from this point of view. But although
behaviour characters are thought of with respect to-day, there are,
even so, too few actual investigations of this type made. This is
probably because it is more difficult to observe, measure, and record
a behaviour pattern than, say, a colour pattern. For this reason, a
combined investigation has been planned, and already begun, to
analyse the relationships of a group of birds using information obtained

from recording their structures, behaviour, genetics, and geographical
and ecological distributions. When all this information is pieced
together, the result, it is hoped, will give as clear a picture of their
evolution as is possible.
Because the study of the behaviour of a large number of closely
related bird species necessitates the use of a large number of aviaries,
the choice of species for such a study is narrowed down immediately
to very small birds--for spacial economy--and to species that are
easily available. This leads inevitably to the Mannikins and Grass-
finches, which breed readily in captivity and which have simple food
requirements. The work that has been done so far has been concen-
trated on a few species, and now that this initial reconnaissance has
proved successful, a much wider range of species is being obtained and
investigated.
The Cutthroat Finch
One of the first species studied in the present investigation was the
Cutthroat Finch. This species has been bred in captivity as long
ago as the eighteenth century, and is particularly hardy. It occurs
in East, West, and Central Africa, and is replaced in South Africa
by a very closely related species, the Red-headed Finch (Amadina
erythrocephala ). Although these two species are at present classified
with the Mannikin tribe (Amadinae), they are rather different from
the typical Mannikins. The male is very distinctly different from
the female, whereas in all the typical Mannikins, the sexes are alike.
Also the mottling of the light brown plumage is rather unlike that of
other Mannikin species. A third difference is that the nestlings of the
Cutthroat Finch do not exhibit the characteristic horseshoe-shaped
marking inside the mouth. All Mannikins, in which nestling mouth-
markings are known, possess the typical horseshoe-shape, but the
Cutthroat nestling shows large blotches inside its mouth instead.
These and other facts make the Cutthroat a particularly interesting
species to study ; for, since it does not fit any too easily into its present
taxonomic position, any new data/:oncerning it may help to improve
the way in which it is classified. In the present paper, however, I will
confine myself more to a discussion of the displays which this species
uses in its courtship behaviour, because until we know more about the
behaviour of many of the Mannikin species, it will be impossible to
make any statements about the possible evolution of the group. This
stage has yet to be reached. In the meantime, it is very profitable
to look at the courtship displays for their own sake.
The Song-and-Dance of the Male
The male Cutthroat differs from the female in appearance by
having, not only the famous "cut-throat", but also a dark brown

patch over the belly region. However, owing to the startling sex-
difference provided by the red throat-patch, the brown belly-patch is
seldom referred to. It is nevertheless important, in the display of
the male to the female, immediately before copulation.
The male birds, when in full sexual condition, sing almost in-
cessantly. During most of their singing, they pay no attention to the
females, and do not orient themselves towards them. Throughout
this singing, the heads of the males are swung smartly and distinctly
from side to side.
In this species, as in several related ones, it has become quite clear
that this song does not have the same function, nor, apparently, the
same causation, as in many other kinds of birds. Typical song has
the effect of intimidating rivals--warning them off a territory, or
disputing a boundary--and of attracting females. It is primarily
aggressive. In the Cutthroat, the song appears to have not the slightest
threatening effect on other males, but, if anything, rather attracts them
to the singer. Also variations in aggressiveness and singing seem to
bear no relation to one another. This may be due to the distortion
of life in captivity, or it may be due to the fact that all this group of
birds have become semi-social and may nest together in close
proximity under circumstances that would make ordinary song and
territorial behaviour a hindrance.
Although song may be given by Cutthroats when several birds are
sitting together in one part of an aviary, it is more likely to occur
when a male is left alone, for example, when all the other birds are
down on the ground feeding. In the case of the Java Sparrow (Padda
oryzivora ), which is also a member of the Amadinae, I only ever heard
a male sing when it was left alone by its mate. The Java Sparrow
song was very infrequent, however, and it appears that as the
frequency of singing increases, so the males may sing even when their
mates are sitting next to them on a branch, although even under these
circumstances it is still possible to detect that the song is more likely
to occur when no other bird is close at hand.
In the case of the Cutthroat and its relatives, the song is also included
as an almost non-stop accompaniment of the courtship dance of the
male. This courtship singing differs from the type described above
mainly in that the male now orients himself towards the female and
specially directs the singing at her, instead of into space. As he
sings, so he advances along the branch towards her. If she is
unresponsive and does not intend to be mated with, she hops or flies
away at this point. If she is moderately responsive, she remains
still on the branch as the male advances, her feathers sleeked, ready
for a quick take-off if necessary. If she is very responsive, she reacts
to the song and dance of the male with an invitation display. If she
gives this, it acts as a signal to the male that she is ready to copulate

with him. He responds by mounting her, their cloacae are brought
into contact, and insemination takes place.. The male then dismounts
and usually both birds shake and preen themselves.
But what is the precise nature of the movements made by the
displaying male as he dances to the female, and what exactly is the
significance of the invitation display of the female ? All too often,
such displays are described simply as " comical antics They are,
however, much more than this to the birds concerned, being specific
signals which indicate the mood of the individual performing them.
Just as man-made signals, such as traffic-lights, must be quite precise
and rigid, so that their meaning cannot be misconstrued, so it is
found that animal signals are also quite fixed and rigid in form.
In the evolution of a species, a particular display movement becomes
uniquely associated with a special mood of the performer. Just as
the green light of a traffic indicator means exclusively go to the
motorist, so the invitation display of the female means mount to the
male. Just as the green light signifies that the cross-roads are clear
for the motorist to continue, so the invitation display of the female
bird signifies that she is ready to be mounted and will not flee. The
question remains as to why one type of display, rather than another,
should be performed by any one species in any one instance. Before
answering this it is necessary to describe the display of the Cutthroat
in some detail.
The Inverted Curtsey
As the male advances towards the female, he assumes an upright
posture, which is much more vertical than his normal stationary
pose. Also, his feathers are raised in a special way. Most of his
feathers are somewhat raised, but his ventral feathers are not all
raised to the same degree. Careful observation shows that the feathers
in the ventral region are differentially raised in such a way as to
exaggerate and enlarge the brown belly-patch to a maximum. This
has the effect, viewing the bird frontally (as does the female Cut-
throat), of displaying the brown patch efficiently during the advance.
It is so swollen that the lower belly feathers reach down beyond the
branch on which the male is standing. Seen sideways, the bird appears
to have grossly over-eaten, there being a large brown swelling in the
belly region ! As the male advances in this posture down the branch
towards the female, it gives a rapid series of dance movements every
few hops it takes. It advances a little way, then, pausing, stretches
and bends its legs very rapidly a number of times in quick succession.
The body is held at the same, rather vertical, angle as it is raised
and lowered, and the general effect has been likened, by certain
authors, to the human curtsey. But a correction is necessary here,
for the first element of a human curtsey is a downward one. The legs

D. MORRIS--THE COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF THE CUTTHROAT FINCH I 73
start stretched and then bend and then straighten again. But the
reverse is the case with the Cutthroat. It begins with its legs bent,
straightens them, and then bends them again. Then, without pausing,
it repeats this action a number of times in rapid succession. Then it
stops dancing and hops nearer to the female, only to repeat the whole
performance over again. Each little dance is therefore a series of
inverted curtseys. But why should the dance take this particular form ?
By studying many such displays and movements, the general con-
clusion that has been arrived at is this. Animals often perform low
intensity versions of activities which do not lead to the completed
act, but which one can nevertheless recognize as being its first stage.
For example, when a man gets up from an armchair he leans forward
and places his hands on the arms of the chair and then rises. If one
watches the whole action take place a number of times, it soon
becomes clear, even if one only sees the man lean forward in the
characteristic manner, that he intends to get up. Thus the first
sign that he is going to get up is not actually seeing him rise, but
seeing the intention movements of rising. Footballers and boxers, for
example, make great use of the fact that human beings react very
keenly to intention movements. For instance, a footballer pretends
to kick the ball to the left and then, while his opponent is reacting to
that intention movement, he kicks it to the right. Reactions to
intention movements are very common in birds, and, in evolution,
it appears that certain intention movements and the appropriate
responses to them have become " fixed " as special inborn signals.
Not only that, but they have also become modified--usually exagger-
ated in some way--and now have the quality of rituals. During this
process of ritualization, the original intention movement, from which
a signal has been formalized, is often obscured by the now wildly
exaggerated version in which it is seen. But in the case of the Cut-
throat, and in a number of other cases, ritualization has not gone
so far as completely to mask the derivation of the display. For, if the
dancing male Cutthroat is observed closely, it will be seen that the
upward movement of each inverted curtsey is sharper, quicker, and
more forceful than the downward movement. This can only
mean one thing, namely that each series of inverted curtseys is a
series of intention movements of jumping up, and as the male is facing
the female, and, further, as the courtship ends with the male jumping
on to the back of the female, the jumping up in this case must mean
mounting. Therefore I interpret the dance of the male Cutthroat
as a series of intention movements of mounting the female.
But why, in the first place, should the male have been making
only intention movements to mount ? There are two possible answers
here. The first is that the sexual tendencies of the male may have been
thwarted by the female refusing to give any indication of readiness
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.991578444444444" page_id="56238350"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
I 74 D. MORRIS-THE COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF THE CUTTHROAT FINCH
to be mounted. In his sexually aroused, but thwarted, condition,
the male may then have kept on starting off the mounting action, but
never quite completing it, until finally the female gave the invitation
signal. It is easy to see how this situation could have evolved into
the present one. Alternatively, there is considerable evidence that
the male is afraid of approaching close to the female when he is courting
her. His upright posture and his hesitant advance, for example, lead
one to think of his mood as being basically a conflict between a sexual
tendency to mount the female and at the same time a tendency to
flee from her. The reason for the intention movements could, there-
fore, be that the male has to overcome his inclination to flee from
the female.
This second explanation applies more clearly in a related species,
the Zebra Finch, which I have studied in rather more detail. In this
species, the male also performs a song and dance as he approaches
the female, but, unlike the Cutthroat, he does not give the inverted
curtsey dance, but a&amp;apos; lateral pivoting dance instead. He swings his
body from left to right as he advances, and as he does so, swings his
tail round even farther than his body, so that it is displayed to the
female. The male Zebra Finch also holds himself in an upright
posture and shows signs of being hesitant in his advance towards the
female. Each of the lateral swings of his body can be thought of as
intention movements of turning away from the female to flee from
her. The male turns away to the left as if to flee and then, his sexual
tendency getting the upper hand, he swings back towards the female
again. But this brings him closer to the female, and his tendency
to flee increases again and he turns away to the right, and so on.
Specific differences, such as the one described above, between the
dance-types of the male Cutthroat and the male Zebra Finch are very
helpful indeed in determining the relationships between species.
Work is going on at present to ascertain the dance-types of as many
species of Mannikin and Grassfinch as possible. It must be stressed
that a difference or similarity in such a behaviour character as dance-
type is just as reliable for classifying the species concerned, as is the
colour or marking of their plumage. In fact the two types of character
are often related, as I hope to show below.
The Invitation Display
Returning for a moment to the display of the female Cutthroat ;
when the male has danced to her for some time, she may give the
invitation display which consists of placing herself in a horizontal
posture, couching low over the perch. She then proceeds to quiver
her tail in a series of immensely rapid vibrations. They are so rapid
that, until they have been filmed in slow motion, it will be impossible
to analyse them fully. The main path of the vibrations, however,
</bodyText>

D. MORRIS--THE COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF THE CUTTHROAT FINCH I 75
appears to be a vertical one, but it is by no means as simple as that.
I said earlier that sometimes movements become ritualized to such
an extent that they are difficult, if not impossible, to relate to their
origins. This female display is just such a case. It is, in fact, the
most completely ritualized movement I have ever observed, and I can
only guess at its origin. Tentatively, it can be suggested that this
is a very rapid series of ritualized intention movements of fleeing,
presumably prevented from developing into actual fleeing by the
conflicting sexual tendency to remain near the male. In support of
this, the female is in the horizontal posture typical of the take-off
before leaving a branch. Also, flicking of the tail is often seen as
part of the usual take-off intention movement.
Again, here is a problem which will probably best be solved by a
wide comparative study of a number of related species, for there is
quite a chance that some species will not have ritualized the action
to such a degree and that its origin will then become clearer. Lorenz
found this in many cases with his ducks. Unfortunately, all species
of Mannikin and Grassfinch, in which I have observed the female
invitation display so far, appear to be equally ritualized. (But there
are many more species to be observed yet !)
The Display Markings
Finally, something must be said about the nature of the bright
colours and vivid markings which are used in display.
It is dangerous for animals to be too conspicuous because it renders
them too vulnerable to predation. Many animals are completely
cryptic and show no bright colours or markings at all, but a number
arrive at a compromise. They can be cryptic or conspicuous as the
occasion demands. The one way of doing this is to possess a trans-
formation display of some sort, such as the inflation of pouches,
air-sacs, and the like, or to change colour during the breeding season,
risking the danger of attracting predators only during that time of
the year, in order to be conspicuous in display. The other way of
compromising is to be cryptic over that area which the predator
normally sees, and conspicuous over that area which the mate, or
rival, normally sees. This latter method is the one adopted by all
the Grassfinches and Mannikins. They are all cryptic from above,
so that when a flying predator looks down at them from above, say,
feeding on the ground, he cannot see them too clearly. All the
Grassfinches and Mannikins, as far as I know, without exception
possess back and wing plumage colour which merges with their
natural environments. Their ventral surfaces, however, are a different
question altogether. Here one finds bars, spots, bands, and patches
of colour and intense contrast. These are displayed to the female
by the courting males, and it is remarkable to note how frequently
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.989757466666667" page_id="56238352"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
I 76 D. MORRIS-THE COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF THE CUTTHROAT FINCH
the particular patch of colour or contrast, possessed by a particular
species, is displayed so well by the special dance movements and
posturings of that species. I will use the Cutthroat and the Zebra
Finch as two excellent examples of this. The former has a frontal
brown patch on its belly, and a frontal red patch on its throat. Its
display is performed facing the female, and the male fluffs out its
brown patch to the full, and then proceeds to shake it up and down
at the female. In the case of the Zebra Finch, the male keeps on
turning its sides to the female, and thus displays its white-spotted,
chestnut-coloured, flank feathers, which, although normally carried
inconspicuously inside its wings, are now fluffed outside them for the
occasion. Also, the male displays its chestnut ear-patches, one after
the other, as it pivots in front of the female. The twisting of its tail,
through an angle which makes it clearer for the female to see, also
displays a special marking, for the tail of the Zebra Finch is banded,
with intense contrast, in black and white.
A study of many such correlations, between bright markings and
display movements, has revealed that it is a general rule with animals ;
and further, that it seems likely that the movement has preceded the
colour in evolution. This is borne out by the fact that many species
of a group often show a particular movement, but not all have
developed a bright marking which can be displayed by it. It seems
that when a particular organ, such as the tail, is moved about in
display, any mutations which occur which make the tail of that species
more conspicuous, will be strongly favoured, since they will draw,
even more, the attention of the opposite sex to the displaying individual.
It is unnecessary to mention in detail the bizarre extremes to which
some species have taken this principle (Birds of Paradise, Pheasants,
etc.). Most species do not go too far because, as stated above,
predators as well as mates are likely to be attracted !
Conclusion
I have attempted to give some idea of the type of bird behaviour
analysis that can and is being carried out using some of the commonest
of aviary birds. This work is expanding rapidly at the moment and,
as a result, it is hoped that when a greater number of species has been
studied, both the interrelationships between the various species,
and the organization of their reproductive behaviour systems, will
be more clearly understood.
From the point of view of the classification of the group, the produc-
tion of hybrids is of the utmost importance, in order to obtain some
idea of their genetical make-up. Many Mannikin and/or Grassfinch
hybrids are reported in the literature, but photographs of them are
rare, and descriptions are often too brief to be of much use. It is
hoped that, in the next few years, it will be possible to produce a large

variety of hybrids, with the aid of artificially increased day-lengths
and, if necessary, injections of sex hormones. However, this will
undoubtedly be a slow process, and it is also hoped to obtain valuable
information from some of the many private breeders of these birds,
who may already possess just those hybrids in which we are most
interested.

The sadly neglected dove family contains many a bird of great
beauty and loveliness. From the humble Barbary, with its laughing
call, gentle coo, and sober Quaker-like dress, to the more exotically
clad Green-wing with ruby bill and sparkling, vividly green plumage.
The dainty little Harlequin's moth-like flight has a charm which
must be seen to be believed--misty grey above and gleaming cinnamon
beneath, and in the cock, the orange and red bill foiled by its black
mask. The blue-grey, brown-flecked English Turtle-Dove's almost
purring note harmonizing so wonderfully with the sharp pheasant-like
call of the Vinaceous Turtle-Dove and the treble coos of the dainty
little rosy pink Senegal and the Necklace Doves. The latter with its
deep checkered collar and crimson ringed eye. How can anyone
say that the dove's song is monotonous ? Why, no two birds--even
of the same species--coo exactly alike.
Last year, two of the fawn Barbarys gave me a little white nestling
as a fellow to a fawn one. Also I believe I have an albino Barbary.
The difference between them is that the first bird has the spacercollar
and yellow eye-ring of the " Java ", while the second has no suspicion
of a collar and a cream eye-ring with eyes that flash red in the sun's
light. Also I was lucky enough to breed two Barbary x English
Turtle hybrids.
Though perhaps few doves are brilliantly coloured (those which
are, are outstandingly so), all have a soft harmony of colour that
would be the envy of any dress designer and quite vies description
with their soft merging and mingling.
All the above-mentioned birds live quite happily in eight unheated,
grassed aviaries in a shrub planted plum orchard. The whole garden
is very well sheltered by pines, rhododendrons, a privet hedge, and
a gorse-topped turf bank, which does much to keep at bay keen winds.

There is also a largish goldfish pool, with pink and white water lilies,
and tiny artificial stream.
The houses of the aviaries are made of tongued and grooved wood
with heavy roofing felt on the roof, and on their north and east sides
for extra protection.
The birds are mainly fed upon split maize, paddy rice, and millet,
with sugar sprinkled bread and milk for all nesting Doves.
Rock salt somehow seems to increase the bloom on the bird's
plumage, and tends to intensify the colour, and we feel it is absolutely
necessary for the Green-wings. In their native home, I am told, they
frequent the salt-licks and it is believed there they die if they are denied
access to them for more than twenty-four hours.
As the doves are gathered from many countries, so are the trees
and flowering shrubs which surround them, and do so much to provide
a beautiful setting. The Bird Cherry blossoms beside the Indian
Gatalpa Bean, Canadian and Japanese Maples, are backed by the
evergreens of Northern Europe, and the Liquidambers of America
glow among the silver birches and oaks of England. Rhododendrons
of many colours blossom in their appointed season. The wisteria of
distant China clings and rambles among the branches of our native
apple trees, one of which has mistletoe " in its hair ".
Goldcrests nest in the cedars, Sparrows in the ivy and tits---of
various kinds--in specially set-up nest boxes. Robins and Hedge-
Sparrows are housekeeping in the gorse bank. A vent pipe has made
a rather odd home for a pair of Starlings. Thrushes have reared a
family high up on the rhododendrons. Blackbirds and the Green
Woodpeckers, too, have nests somewhere in the garden. Brown
squirrels gambol among the Scots pines where the Wood-Pigeons are
nesting. A Nightingale, in summer, often sings in the apple tree
beside the window, but they have not nested in the garden. We do
wish they would !
The other day, when the doves were softly cooing, we were much
amused to hear that a little girl visitor--staying in a nearby house--
ran indoors calling out, " Auntie, Auntie, the lady over the hedge
has a garden that's simply full of Cuckoos ! "

An interesting and curiously coloured Plantain-eater, the Uganda
Black-faced (Crinifer per sonata leopoldi ), was brought back by Mr. Seago
during July. It belongs to the sub-genus Gymnoschizorhis of which, as
pointed out in recent correspondence, there are two forms. The body
colour is of soft pale shades of grey and brownish-grey, the neck is
white, and there is an incongruous looking patch of green on the breast.
A Varied Thrush (Hesperocichla navia ) has been deposited. This
and the Plantain-eater are new to the collection.
Presentations include a Martial Hawk Eagle (Polymatus bellicosus ) ;
three Squacco Herons (Ardeola ralloides ) ; a Common Heron (Ardea
cinerea ) ; a Bank Myna (Acridotheres ginginianus ), and fourteen
Budgerigars, six of them trained " homing " birds from Mrs. Upton's
flock.
Two Black-chinned Yuhinas (Tuhina gularis) ; five Green Imperial
Fruit Pigeons (Ducula anea) ; three Nicobar Pigeons (Calcenas
nicobarica ), and a Narcissus Flycatcher (Xanthopygia narcissina) have
been deposited.
Purchases consist of a One-wattled Cassowary (Casuarius unappendi-

Perhaps the most interesting nesting event was that of a pair of the
Tawny Frogmouths in the Australian Collection. One egg was laid
and it contained a chick which had died when nearly ready to hatch.
The breeding pair of King Penguins' egg was infertile. As is well
known, these birds moult just before the breeding season and choice of
mates is dependent upon the time that the individual birds moult.
The breeding female preferred her old mate, though he did not
moult until some time later than she, and it may have been that he
was not ready to breed at the time the egg was laid. One of the

bred here in 1952--at any rate, he took his turn at incubating the
egg, but after a few days it was somehow broken. It could scarcely
have been fertile, for observations at Edinburgh show that these
Penguins do not breed until the fifth year.
The report that a young Green-winged King Parrakeet hatched at
the Parrot House had been destroyed by vermin is incorrect. Mice
have been exterminated, and the very few rats in the Gardens do not
get into the parrakeet aviaries. The old breeding pair of Green-
winged Kings have a fine young one which has just left the nest.
The " homing " Budgerigar aviary is now completed and contains
some fifty birds.

Walter Higham showed his recently completed coloured film, " Birds
of the Scottish Highlands." In this, typical Scottish birds such as the
Dotterel, Ptarmigan, Greenshank, Capercaillie, Crested Tit, Red-
throated and Black-throated Diver, and Slavonian Grebe, are shown.
The Buzzard, Corncrake, Greyhen, Common Gull, Sandpiper, and
other birds are dealt with ; and a visit is made to a colony of nesting
Black-headed Gulls.

The most important part of the film, however, deals with the
Golden Eagle. For many years Walter Higham visited the Highlands
in search of eyries suitable for filming. At last, after fourteen years,
he succeeded in finding two of very different types. One was built in
a tree near the head of a glen, the other amidst rocks, high up on a
mountain side. The result of this perseverance is a fine series of
photographs of family life.
In thanking Walter Higham for showing his absorbingly interesting
film the Chairman said the technical quality was well in keeping
with the very high standard associated with this famous photographer.
The audience showed by its sustained applause that it was in full
agreement with this tribute.
The next meeting of the Club is on 10th November, 1954.

Dr. Roger Tory Peterson (National Geographic Magazine , August,
1954) gives a very interesting account of the unassisted arrival and
settlement of the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) in America. This Egret
is a familiar sight in southern Spain, in Africa, and in the warmer
parts of Asia. Some twenty years ago it appeared suddenly in South
America. Just how it made the transatlantic flight and when is not
known. The birds flourished and within twenty years the flocks have
increased and spread, with the result that the species has now
been seen in Florida, where as many as 152 have been counted,
Virginia, Maryland, and other Atlantic Coast States ; also in New-
foundland. This is a bird migration unprecedented in history i;

The Avicultural Magazine has now reached the venerable age
of three score years. While rejoicing in this fact, we must not overlook
a milestone in the existence of a journal with somewhat similar objects,
namely Foreign Birds , formerly the News Bulletin of the Foreign Bird
Exhibitors' League, now the magazine of the Foreign Bird League.
The League was founded in March, 1933, and has thus " come of
age ". The prime mover in its foundation, Harold King, is still the
guiding genius, being both Hon. Secretary and Editor, and it is due
mainly to his efforts that it is in such a strong position. It is worthy
of record that the President, Chairman, the majority of the principal
officers, together with some three hundred members, are also members
of the Avicultural Society.

Credit for this breeding is due to our member, W. H. Punter. This
is a somewhat uncommon event and the records are few. The Pink-
footed bred for many years with Major P. Hammond, D.S.O., of
Blakeney, Norfolk. Two of the young ones were given to W. H.
St. Quintin, and from these young were bred at Scampston Hall, in
1924 and 1925. The Kensington Gardens' birds originally came from
Peter Scott in 1947. In answer to our inquiry, Peter Scott said they
have not yet succeeded in breeding the Pink-footed at Slimbridge.
He also drew attention to the fact that Dr. John Berry has bred them
annually for some years : so has a Mr. Williams, in Norfolk.

gars and Lovebirds). By M. Legendre, with illustrations by
L. Delapchier. Editions N. Boubee &amp; Cie. Paris, 1954.
Price 500 francs.
In the preface to his book Oiseaux de Cage , which was reviewed in the
May-June number, 1953, of the Avicultural Magazine, Monsieur
Legendre stated that he hoped to deal with the Parrots and Doves,
which were not included in that book, in later volumes. The book
under review follows the same lines as its forerunner, and the first
and larger half is devoted to Budgerigars. The opening chapter is an
account of the original Budgerigar in Australia, and this is followed
by chapters on the first importations, acclimatization in Europe,
colour varieties, aviaries, bird-rooms and cages, feeding, breeding,
taming, and illnesses.
The second part of the book, which deals with Lovebirds, opens
with a description of the various species, after which there is a chapter
containing general information. It is stated that the information
given concerning the keeping of Budgerigars also applies very largely
to Lovebirds, so the various points are not dealt with so fully as in
the first section of the book. Details regarding the special needs of
Lovebirds are given, and it is pointed out that some species are more
sensitive to cold than Budgerigars, and attention is drawn to their

same species. Full descriptions of nine species are then given, with
details of their native haunts, first importations, requirements in

The book is well illustrated with good photographs and two colour
plates, one showing four varieties of Budgerigars and the other five
species of Lovebirds. In addition, there are a number of line drawings, 1
and diagrams showing the layout of aviaries. The book is dedicated

(The experiences of a bird-lover between two ages and in two
worlds). By Wilhelm Kracht. Verlag Gottfried Helene,
Pfungstadt-Darmstadt. Price 5.90 DM.
As Dr. J. Steinbacher says in his Introduction, this book is the
story of the varied life of a man who is both an expert at bird keeping
and a great bird-lover.
In the first chapter Wilhelm Kracht describes his early efforts at
keeping and rearing birds in a small village in Westfahlen where no
one had any knowledge of this art, and relates that the first bird he
kept was a Blackbird. He gives a vivid description of the countryside
and the life at that time--the last part of the nineteenth century--
and concludes the chapter by giving a list of the different species of
birds he kept. The author then describes his experiences in Paris
where he had a post, and his first visit to the Paris bird market. His
journeys then took him to Madrid where he again paints a word
picture of the life and country, with particular attention to the birds
he kept there. This is followed by an account of the time he spent
in Berlin, his friendship with the Heinroths, and the many species of
birds he kept in captivity. In 1913 he went to Odessa, where he states
he reached the peak of bird keeping ; he remained in Russia for six
years and returned to Germany in 1918, where he lived in various
towns, always keeping birds or maintaining his interest in some way,
and finally settled in Freiburg. Wilhelm Kracht has lived during
a period of great change and visited widely differing countries, and
he writes vividly of his impressions, the life of the countries he has
lived in, the interesting people he has met, and the many different
species of birds he has kept, varying from small passerine birds to
various species of Eagles. His book contains much interesting informa-
tion gained from his own practical experiences.

The Effect of Climatic Conditions on Breeding Results
It has long been the custom to associate inclement weather occurring in Spring
and early Summer with low fertility in foreign birds' eggs--probably rightly, but is
it as simple as that ?
Naturally warmth and sunlight will have a more cheering effect on tropical and
sub-tropical birds than will dull cool weather, but what is the extent of the physio-
logical effect ?
Bad weather seems a likely cause of a falling off of interest in nesting after early
promise that so often happens, but in these cases no eggs are laid. The causes of
infertility in birds' eggs must be many : there may be a lower concentration of
sperms in cold weather, or, though fertilization might be adequate, activation of the
germ does not take place or ceases at an early stage.
Spermatogenesis in domestic poultry is thought to be partly related to the length
of daylight and by early April there are more than twelve hours of daylight.
Climatic conditions appear not to have any effect on the nesting of some birds.
Black-footed Penguins breed in winter here ; Cereopsis Geese usually nest in January ;
Hooded and Brown's Parrakeets in October, and Indian Ringnecks in March, so in
these cases, at least, there seems to be some cyclical influence.
Then there are so often the exceptions. This year, for instance, Mikado Pheasants
and Cape Teal have bred exceptionally well at Leckford and Turquoisine Parrakeets,
the most delicate of the Grass Parrakeets, have bred well at Keston.
Controlled experiments would be very difficult and expensive, but it would be
interesting to see whether another ten degrees of warmth and some artificial sunlight
supplied where practicable during the Spring made any appreciable difference.

When I first came in contact with the Avicultural Magazine, I read that it was
a magazine for British and Foreign Birds. So far, I have only read of the higher
priced foreign birds (with the exception of once, when Mr. Boosey gave an article
on Zebra Finches). Would it not be possible to have more notes on the more common
birds ; we are not all millionaires, and while the more exotic birds make interesting
reading for the richer people, they do not interest the common everyday working
class. I would like to read more about the British birds and cheaper foreign finches,
etc. There is very little in the Magazine to interest me at the present time, and
I believe it would be of more interest to a lot of subscribers if articles such as I have
just mentioned were more frequent. No offence now please ; I'm just writing what
I think.

I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed in this letter, and am only too anxious
to receive articles on the more common birds. It is quite a mistaken idea that because
a bird is commonly kept in captivity there is nothing more of interest to write about it.
When Mr. Delacour came to write his monumental work on Pheasants, he found a
great lack of information regarding the Golden Pheasant, one of the most popular
species kept in captivity. And with regard to ornithology in general, it is significant
that though there have been monographs written on many of the rarer species,
knowledge regarding the House Sparrow is lamentably small.-- Editor.

MAGPIES AND SQUIRRELS AS MENACES TO AVICULTURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99597559375" page_id="56238362"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
Although they are pests, I had never thought of either the Magpie or the Grey
Squirrel as actual avicultural menaces. Both, it is true, will frighten birds by running
about on top of their aviary, but so will an innocent stray homing-pigeon that alights
upon it.
I now know, however, that the presence of Magpies and Grey Squirrels gives cause
for far greater anxiety.
The late Duke of Bedford's breeding pair of Blue Ringnecks hatched every egg and
had four young ones in the nest. In the middle of May, however, when they were at
the stage when they are only just starting to feather, but are too big to be brooded,
the weather became more and more arctic every day, so, on looking in the nest-box,
I was hardly surprised to find that the three youngest had died of cold. The fourth
was better-clothed and eventually fledged successfully. It had, however, a habit of
clinging on to the wire netting, and a few days later was found dead with a chest
wound. The Magpies had been taking a great interest in it, and I have little doubt
it was they who killed it by jabbing at it through the wire netting. Had it been
murdered by its parents they would almost certainly have scalped it.
A pair of Roseate Cockatoos reared a fine brood of three, and not long after they
fledged the feeding door was mysteriously found wide open, the birds, fortunately,
being still in the aviary.
The button closing the feeding door was somewhat loose, and through a chink, the
sunflower and monkey nuts could be seen from outside. A Grey Squirrel had fre-
quently been seen in the vicinity and inspection of the aviary disclosed a mass of
scrabblings of its toe-nails on the woodwork, particularly round the feeding door.
I think there is little doubt it had discovered that by turning the loose button, it could
get inside and feed, particularly as on the day of the discovery of the open door not
a scrap of food of any kind was left in the food vessel.
The door is now secured by a small bolt, and there has been no further trouble.

Since writing this I have actually seen the squirrel carefully examining the new
door fastening so there is no doubt whatever that he was the culprit.

We thought Chestnut-flanked White Zebra Finch a better name for the new

Vieillot (1817) bestowed its present specific name when he described
it as La Perruche a bandeau rouge , Psittacus frontalis. (By rules of priority,
Psittacus vittatus Shaw (1811) is antedated by P. vittatus Bodd. (1783).)
Peters (1937) gives the distribution as "Southeastern Brazil from
eastern Minas Geraes and Espirito Santo to Rio de Janeiro ".
As usual, very little has been written about this Conure in the wild
state. One of very few writers, J. F. Hamilton (1871), describing a
small collection of birds made in the south of Brazil in the spring of
1869, says : " Very common. I met them frequently in the neigh-
bourhood of maize-plantations, on which they commit great havoc.
Along the Sao-Paulo railroad flocks were frequently seen flying over-
head. 55 Not very enlightening ! But then field-collectors rarely are.
Possibly the first of this species to arrive in this country were the two
purchased for the London Zoological Gardens in May, 1869 ; five
were purchased in June, 1883, since when there have, of course, been
others in the Collection.
D. Seth-Smith (1926) says : " I am informed that some of these
Conures were offered for sale in London in 1898 ; and three speci-
mens, two males and one female, were obtained by the writer on
August 24th, 1903. 55
During the past fifty years just a few have been imported from time
to time, wars and parrot ban permitting, and in 1924 a pair owned by
W. Shore-Baily successfully reared a nest of four young ones, for which
event the Society's Medal was awarded.

A REMEDY FOR AIRPLANE WING

In the summer of 1954, at the Delta Waterfowl Research Station,
Delta, Manitoba, where my mother and I have spent several seasons
raising young marsh birds from the egg to study their behaviour and
development, I was asked by Dr. Martin Moynihan to look at one
of his young Franklin's Gulls, because its right primary joint had
started to turn out.
On examining both wings I discovered that the primary pin
feathers were just starting to develop, and that the affected bone was
noticeably more flexible than the normal one.
I told him what I had been told by Peter Ward, the head of the
duck hatchery, and by two zoo men, that the underlying cause of the
weakened condition of the developing bones was some unknown
deficiency in the diet. I thought, however, that the immediate
cause of the twisting of the joint was the weight of the developing
primaries, and suggested that if the joint were taped into the correct
position it might grow normally.
(The year before, when the wings of one of our hand-raised Franklin's
Gulls were constantly slipping down, I had put them in the wing
pockets several times, telling the young bird kindly but firmly to keep
them there. The next day and from then on the gull carried her
wings properly. I had been equally successful this summer with the
only hatchery raised Blue gosling, although it was not particularly

tame. I think that these young birds, without close association with
adults of their species, had never happened to discover the proper
and comfortable adult method of holding their wings, but almost
immediately adopted it when shown.)
Dr. Moynihan taped the joint into position with ordinary Scotch
tape, just before putting all the young gulls to bed in the dark. Starting
the next day, the joint was held in the correct position. He found this
method completely successful on his two or three gulls whose primary
joints had turned out.
It did not matter whether they were taped as soon as he noticed the
condition or two or three days later, or whether the bird was able
to remove the tape very quickly, or whether it stayed on for several
hours. Sometimes he had to apply the tape for two or three nights
over a period of several days before the bird held its wings normally.
In the case of our hand-raised Sora Rail, whose primaries were
already at least half an inch long, I taped both her wings off and on
over a period of a week. However, it was not till the last time that
I observed her brothers and sisters carefully and tucked her growing
primaries as far under her secondaries as they were holding theirs.
The next day and thenceforward the Sora held her wings correctly.
Also on Peter Ward's advice, Dr. Moynihan immediately bought
a vitamin-mineral supplement, Polynutrin, and sprinkled it on the
birds' food. None of the younger birds showed any indication of
developing airplane wings.
We never taped the wing to the body, but just the primary in the
proper position under the secondaries, and always removed the
Scotch tape some time the next day, holding on to the feathers under
the tape to try to keep from pulling them out or tweaking them.
The birds often lost a few small feathers, but this did not spoil their
appearance.
Whether taping the wings of a bird whose primaries had developed
further would bend the joint into its proper position, and whether the
bird would then hold it so, I have no idea.
In September, 1954, Dr. Konrad Lorenz told me that he treated
airplane wing by making a roll of Scotch tape with the sticky side out,
and putting the upper side under the secondaries and sticking the
sheathes of the developing primary pinfeathers on to the lower side
of the roll, so the primaries were held in the correct position. The tape
was left in place until it dropped off with the feather sheathes.
This method should be less annoying to the birds than having the
tape wrapped around the outside of their wings, and it certainly
would be less trouble to have to tape the wing only once.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
The Pigeon ( Columba livid) is among the commonest of birds in
British towns, as well as elsewhere throughout most of the temperate
and tropical regions of the world. Ornithologists have, however,
tended to ignore this species wherever its populations were derived
from or interbred with domestic stock. Finn (1921) in his book on
London's birds, included it under the name " Common Pigeon ",
a very apt one, as this bird is the Pigeon of the layman. Unfortunately,
Fitter (1945) used the name " London Pigeon " and later he and
Richardson (1952) misleadingly applied it to all feral pigeons,
irrespective of locality or origin. Naumann (1833) gave a most
interesting and detailed account of the status and habits of feral,
dovecote, and domestic pigeons in Germany, and Darwin (1859 and
1868) dealt with the appearance and distribution of dovecote and
domestic pigeons throughout the world. The present paper deals
chiefly with observations on feral birds, but some notes on wild birds
are included, and most of the behaviour patterns described are, of
course, common to all members of the species.
The following terms will be used to designate different categories
of Columba livia
Rock-Pigeons --wild populations of C. livia.
Dovecote Pigeons --pigeons nesting or roosting in dovecotes, pigeon-
towers, barns, etc., exploited by their " owners " for food (young-
pigeons) or dung, but not selectively bred or confined in any way, and
not usually fed by their owners.
Feral Pigeons --pigeons living in a free and ownerless state, but which
have originated from Dovecote or Domestic Pigeons.
Domestic Pigeons. --Pigeons kept under a greater degree of control
subject to selective breeding by man and fed by him.
Homing Pigeons. --Any domestic pigeons kept and bred for their
ability to return home when released at a distance. Such birds are
usually subjected to rigid control and selection by man, and regularly
fed. The breed now used for this purpose in Britain (and elsewhere)
is known as the Racing Pigeon or Racing Homer. The Carrier
Pigeon is a purely fancy breed, and has been so for at least two
centuries.
Flying Pigeons. --Any domestic pigeons kept for the entertainment
they afford their owners by their flying when liberated. This may
consist of height and duration of flight (tipplers, cumulets), or
aberrant forms of flight (tumblers, rollers, sharpshooters). Many
fancy breeds have been derived from Flying Pigeons, and still bear the
same names. (For example : Long-faced and Short-faced Tumblers,

Exhibition Flying Homers, and Show Homers.) These breeds are
subject to control and selection, and are usually kept closely confined
except when liberated to perform.
Fancy Pigeons. --Domestic Pigeons of any of the numerous breeds and
sub-breeds that are kept and bred solely for their appearance and to
conform with some artificial " standard of excellence ". Many of
these birds are monstrosities, incapable of feeding their own young
owing to their abnormal skull and bill structure.
Pigeon. --The species C. livia, where the remarks made apply equally
to wild, feral, or non-monstrous domestic birds.
The Origin of Feral Pigeons.
That all Domestic and Dovecote Pigeons owe their origin to the
Rock Pigeon ( Columba livia) and to no other species is fully established
(Darwin, 1868). I have met many ornithologists and pigeon-fanciers
who doubted this fact, but none has any valid evidence to the contrary.
Fertile hybrids have been produced between C. livia and some other
species of Columba (notably and rather surprisingly, the Woodpigeon
(C. palumbus) among them), but the domestic breeds show no trace
of such hybrid ancestry. Where they differ most from the Rock-
Pigeon they differ equally from all other wild species. That the
markings or structural developments of some Domestic Pigeons show
similarity to those of certain wild species not even con-generic with
them is of no significance in this respect (see Darwin, 1868).
The existence of clearly differentiated breeds of Domestic Pigeons
dates back at least to Roman times (Darwin, 1868), but the practice of
keeping, or rather exploiting, Dovecote Pigeons has, at any rate until
recently, been practised on a far larger scale than the breeding of
domestic varieties. Such Dovecote Pigeons were (and usually still
are) very similar to Rock-Pigeons in type. In England and Western
Europe (and doubtless elsewhere) they were mostly either of the
natural blue colour or " blue chequers ", " dark blue chequers ", or
" velvets ", that is birds showing varying degrees of melanism resulting
in the wing-coverts being spotted with black on a grey ground, pre-
dominantly black with some blue-grey spotting or completely black.
There is some likelihood that " chequered " birds may occur among
wild Rock-Pigeons (Darwin, 1868, Petersen a Botni and Williamson,
1 949)j but no proof, as such birds have always been observed in areas
where it is possible that feral or domestic birds could, at some time,
have interbred with the wild ones. Conversely, of course, it is only
in such places that the occurrence of aberrant specimens is likely to
be noticed.
The Feral Pigeons of most parts of the old world appear to have
been derived originally from Dovecote Pigeons that strayed to find
homes for themselves, with a slight admixture of strayed or lost

Domestic Pigeons. Of the latter, only such as approximated to a
Wild Pigeon in form and ability would have survived and successfully
reared progeny. Hence the general similarity of Feral Pigeons to Rock
Pigeons rather than to the various Fancy Pigeons is because, for the
most part, they are descended from birds equally like the wild stock.
There is no need to postulate some hypothetical and semi-mystical
" reversion to the wild type ". In the past century, and more especially
in the last fifty years or so, the widespread popularity of pigeon-racing
has had an enormous effect on the feral population of Britain. Homing
Pigeons get lost in large numbers during training and racing. Most of
them are physically capable of getting their own living and many
which appear psychologically incapable of fending for themselves in
the fields are able to adapt to the more directly parasitic role of " town
pigeon In Britain (as in many other parts of western Europe), the
resultant constant influx of lost Homing Pigeons has coincided with a
widespread elimination of Dovecote Pigeons by man, and with con-
tinued periodic destruction by him of large sections of the feral
population. Because of this the Feral Pigeons in many places are now
predominantly of Homing Pigeon type.
As was pointed out by Darwin (1868), Dovecote Pigeons normally
show characteristics in common with the Rock Pigeons of the same
geographical area, particularly as to the colour (white or grey) of the
rump. Hartert (1912-1921) considered Domestic Pigeons to have
originated separately in various places from different sub-species of
Rock-Pigeon. This is doubtful. It is known that many of our Flying,
Homing, and Fancy Pigeons were first brought to Europe from the
Middle East or India, and it is likely that such breeds as were " made "
in the west were derived from these already domesticated birds rather
than from pristine wild stock. Dovecote Pigeons may have been
derived independently from local wild stock. On the other hand,
their resemblances to the local Rock-Pigeons might be due to inter-
breeding with them, or to similar environmental influences being at
work on the Dovecote Pigeons as on the wild ones.
Sociability and Segregation of Populations.
In all its activities that are not purely reproductive, the Pigeon
is gregarious. It does, however, like most social birds, defend its
roosting perch and an area around the nest which varies in size
according to circumstances. For a detailed account of sexual and
aggressive behaviour see Heinroth (1943). This sociability is not
simply a matter of many birds wishing to exploit good feeding, bathing,
or resting places at the same time. The lone Pigeon will actively seek
a companion to rest near. A good example was given by a female in
my possession, which I hand-reared after it had fallen from its nest.
When it began to fly about it soon discovered some Barbary Doves

preening perched above them on the wire roof of their aviary. If they
were not in the open part, but in the shelter, the Pigeon rested on a
ledge outside their shelter window, through which it could see them.
This Pigeon is blue, its parents were a blue and a blue chequer. It
had never in its life seen a Pigeon of similar colour to these doves, yet
it evidently recognized them (? by shape and movement) as " the
nearest thing ". It was not at that period reacting sexually to the
doves, but regarded me as its mate, and left them to seek my company
whenever I appeared.
That Feral and Domestic Pigeons interbreed in many cases with
Rock-Pigeons is familiar to all, since it is mentioned, often emphasized,
in most accounts of the species. The far more interesting fact that in
many places there is very little interbreeding--relative to the apparent
opportunities for it--between Feral, Dovecote, and Rock-Pigeons on
one hand and Domestic Pigeons on the other has received little
attention, although it was remarked upon (Adams, 1864) briefly
nearly a century ago. This is very noticeable in the Nile Delta, where
the Dovecote and Feral Pigeons are very similar to the local Rock-
Pigeons (C. lima schimperi ), but the Domestic Pigeons are mostly much
larger and white, pied, or red in colour. Such relative segregation
may arise, partly through birds tending to pair with those in the same
colony (though I know no proof of any such tendency), partly through
human interference, but also partly, I think, through the preferences
of the birds themselves. It is known that in many species of pigeons
and other birds, recognition of their own kind is not innate, but occurs
through the young bird identifying itself with the creature which has
reared it and/or with which it has been reared. This is probably
true for C. livia. It is certainly a fact that the young Pigeon will often
show a strong preference to pair with another similar in appearance to
those which reared it, or among which it spent its early days. Such
preference may be most striking in members of the more unusually
coloured domestic breeds and is generally thought to be due to
their being " instinctively " drawn to their own aberrant kind.
It is, however, a result of " imprinting " ; such birds only show this
trait if they have been reared by, and spent their youth with, pigeons
like themselves.
Thus whenever the majority of Domestic Pigeons differ appreciably
in appearance from the majority of Feral (or Rock or Dovecote)
Pigeons it is likely that barriers to interbreeding arising from
differences in ecology will be reinforced by the acquired mating
preferences of the birds. In countries, such as Britain, where the
keeping and racing of Homing Pigeons is practised on a large scale,

the situation is very different. Here thousands of lost Homing Pigeons
are scattered widely throughout the country every spring and summer.
The vast majority of those which survive join other Domestic Pigeons
or Feral Pigeons in towns, but presumably some join cliff-dwelling
Feral or Rock-Pigeons. A lost Homing Pigeon that joined a flock
of Rock-Pigeons would perforce have to accept one of these as a mate.

Since it would be used to seeing companions of this colour--among
others--it would have no aversions to so doing. Apart from colour
(which in many is identical with or similar to that of the Rock-
Pigeon), a Racing Homer differs from the wild form being larger,
having a proportionately heavier bill, larger cere (called cc wattle " by
pigeon-fanciers) and more bare skin (" cere 55 of pigeon-fanciers) round
the eyes. It is unlikely that these differences would deter a Rock-
Pigeon from pairing with a Homing Pigeon, at least if the latter
were blue or blue-chequer in colour. Indeed, it is conceivable that
if the Rock-Pigeon were the female and the Homing Pigeon the male,
their differences in size and head proportions might be mutually
attractive rather than otherwise. The difference between them being,
in effect, an exaggeration of the normal sexual dimorphism, which is
slight in the Rock Pigeon but more pronounced in most strains of
Homing Pigeons.

Despite its theoretical probability, however, there seem to be few
actual records of mixed pairs of Rock and Feral Pigeons. In a brief
trip to the Shetlands last June, I saw apparently pure Rock-Pigeons
within a mile of Feral Pigeons that showed no trace of wild inter-
mixture. Mr. W. B. Alexander informs me that he suspects that small
groups of Rock-Pigeons still exist in some of the Yorkshire and Welsh
cliffs, maintaining their purity in spite of the large Feral Pigeon
populations in the same areas. It is quite possible that where Rock-
Pigeons have been replaced by Feral Pigeons this has been achieved
through their " going under 55 in competition with the latter rather
than extensive interbreeding between them. For example, safe rain-
proof nest-sites may often be scarce. Where this is the case a pair
that can obtain and hold such a site will, in the course of a very few
years, rear many more young to independence than will a dozen
other pairs that are forced to " make do " with inferior nesting places.
Some Local British Populations .
In some instances these observations are little more than impressions
based on brief visits of only a day or two. They are in such cases
offered very tentatively rather to stimulate further investigation than
for any other reason. The dates and duration for which such popula-
tions have been under intermittent observations are given in brackets.
Inner London (igg6-ig40 and ig^y-iggP). --Here the Pigeons show
every intergradation between a small minority almost if not quite
identical in type with the wild form and a much larger minority
which, although unringed, are to all appearances pure Homing
Pigeons. The majority are about mid-way between these two
extremes, but inclining to Homing Pigeon rather than otherwise.
On the whole the smaller Dovecote Pigeon types are more numerous
in the most central districts, suggesting that the influx or establishment
of lost Homing Pigeons has been greatest in the peripheral areas.
I have never seen a ringed bird (" first generation homer ") among
the small parties, pairs or singletons that one finds busily searching
for food in back streets, railway stations, etc., and hardly ever failed
to spot one or more in any flock waiting to be fed in a park or square.
I have dealt elsewhere (Goodwin, 1952) with the colour-varieties
of London's pigeons, but must emphasize here that there is no correla-
tion between colour and type. Homing Pigeons, or for that matter
Fantails, may be identical in colour with wild birds.
Windsor. --Most, if not all are of Homing Pigeon type, some indi-
viduals are, however, rather neater and smaller than most Homing
Pigeons, and may represent Dovecote Pigeon origin.
Scarborough [April, ig^o-June, ig^o , and November , 7945).--In 1940
there were about a dozen birds of Homing Pigeon type living in the
castle ruin on top of the cliff. When I returned in 1945 the colony

had increased to at least two hundred, probably many more. These
birds fed inland during the day and returned during the afternoon
and evening to roost on the cliff ledges. Most of the roosting places
offered little shelter and I saw no pigeons entering any of the holes
or crevices, all of which seemed to be owned and defended by Jack-
daws. All the pigeons seen at close quarters were Homing Pigeons
or their immediate descendants.
Bristol ( September , iggg, and May , iggg, two days only). --Here, as in
London, I got the impression of stocks derived from a Dovecote Pigeon
nucleus, now in process of being swamped out by Homing Pigeons.
A small colony near the station were largely of Dovecote Pigeon type,
had they been a little smaller one or two of the blues could have
passed for Rock Pigeons. Most other birds seen were, however,
close or identical to Homing Pigeons, and ringed birds were plentiful.
Lerwick ( June , igj4, two days). --The many Pigeons I saw in the
streets and about the dock were of Homing Pigeon type. About half
were racers bearing rings. Most of these appeared to be having a
hard time, and their tails had been pulled out. About a dozen pairs
of Pigeons were nesting in some boxes fixed to an old barge not far
from the harbour. These were of mixed Dovecote Pigeon and Homing
Pigeon type. None of the birds showed any signs of inter-breeding
with wild stock, and there were no aberrant birds among the Rock
Pigeons I saw on Noss and Bressay near by. I did, however, see a blue
Pigeon and a black pied flying together below the cliffs a short distance
from Lerwick, but was not close enough to see whether the former
was a Rock Pigeon or a blue Homing Pigeon. Lerwick is a major
liberation point for pigeon-fanciers who fly " the north road ", so
that there is likely to be a constant addition of Homing Pigeons to the
local population.
Predators and Competitors.
There can be little doubt that the most important non-human
predators of adult Rock-Pigeons are falcons, particularly or perhaps
mainly the Peregrine ( Falco perignnus). I have never seen Rock or
Feral Pigeons attacked by falcons, but I have seen a good many
pursuits of Homing Pigeons by the Lanner ( Falco biarmicus) in Egypt.
The Lanners are hardly so swift or strong as Peregrines, and I think
they were usually attracted because the circling of our " nomad "
Pigeons, about a basket in the desert, suggested an exhausted or
injured bird to them. When pursued the Pigeon would usually fly
low and swift, jinking slightly sideways or downwards at the moment
that the Falcon struck or attempted to seize it. The Lanner invariably
missed at its initial stoop, and then would sometimes rise for another
attempt, but more often would chase the Pigeon in swift, low flight.
Often the Lanner on overtaking the Pigeon would appear to fly right

over it. This, I think, was due to the Pigeon swerving downwards at
the critical moment. The Lanners seemed unable or unwilling to
keep hold of the Pigeon, as often the latter would be knocked to earth
two or three times, yet finally escape. The chase commonly ended
with the Pigeon managing to return and dive under the army truck
or between our feet. When chased by a falcon, Homing Pigeons--
which are usually very hesitant about entering any strange enclosed
place--will dive headlong into any hole or shelter that offers. A few
would dodge the stoops and circle upwards, trying to gain height.
I imagine these tactics would prove fatal with a Peregrine, and they
perhaps represent an abnormal response by domesticated birds. It is,
however, amazing how stereotyped and perfect the escaping tactics
usually are. I remember well my astonishment on seeing a young
Homing Pigeon that had only been on the wing a few weeks and had
never seen a falcon before, fleeing and dodging in typical manner
as though it had practised escaping from falcons every day of its life.
These escaping movements are also used by the Pigeon when
pursued by Sparrows. Both the House and Spanish Sparrows ( Passer
domesticus and P. hispaniolensis ) have a habit of chasing pigeons and other
large birds. The sparrow flies surprisingly fast close at the Pigeon's
side, as if trying to peck it under the wing. The Pigeon behaves
similarly to when chased by a falcon except that it does not go into
shelter, thereby indicating that it is not so frightened as it appears to be.
Cats, owls, Snapping Turtles, and various other creatures have been
recorded as taking Rock or Feral Pigeons, but I have little or no
personal experience of these predators in relation to them.
In towns, such as London, where they rely largely on bread given
by the public, Feral Pigeons suffer much from the competition of
other birds. They cannot carry off bread as a passerine or gull will
do, nor can they swallow large lumps like a gull or duck, or easily
peck them to pieces like a crow. The annual influx of wintering
Black-headed Gulls greatly reduces the amount of food available to
London's pigeons.
To what extent Feral Pigeons living in the country--and Rock-
Pigeons--suffer from food competition from other species is unknown.
One would think that both the Rook ( Corvus frugilegus) and the
Jackdaw ( Corvus monedula ) might exercise a considerable influence, as
these species also feed largely on grain. The Wood Pigeon ( Columba
palumbus ) is probably not a serious competitor since although fond of
grain and weed-seeds when these are available in quantity, at other
times it relies largely on acorns, nuts, berries, and greenstuff. The
Stock-Dove ( Columba oenas ), however, appears to feed not only on the
same fields, but actually on the same foodstuffs as country-living
Feral Pigeons do. Much detailed and careful work will have to be
done before it can be ascertained if, and to what extent, the two

species compete, but it seems at least possible that the remarkable
increase of the Stock-Dove in Britain and western Europe during the
past hundred years is not unconnected with the contemporary decrease
in the numbers of Rock and Dovecote Pigeons. It would be interesting
to know if there is any region where Rock-Pigeons and Stock-Doves
are both plentiful, and if so whether they there share the same feeding
grounds and compete for the same foods.
Relationship with Man.
Most Feral Pigeons are dependent on man-made buildings for their
nesting and roosting sites. Man's reaction to their presence ranges
from welcoming them as guests or even as sacred birds, as in many
Buddhist and Muslem communities, to active dislike and attempts
to destroy them in many western countries. In Britain and America
the slight disfigurement of buildings by the birds nests and droppings
is considered to justify their destruction.* Such destruction is usually
of a sporadic or haphazard nature, undertaken by officialdom against
the wishes of the majority of people. In London, at any rate, it has
no permanent effect, the periodic mass destruction merely encouraging
a higher breeding success in the survivors. As with man, so with the
Pigeon, it usually happens that the fewer the number of individuals
in any given area, the higher the standard of living which each enjoys.
In country districts Feral Pigeons (and Domestic ones too !) may be
shot for sport or to protect crops. They are, however, often spared
by sportsmen who do not wish to risk shooting domestic birds. Most
unfortunately Rock-Pigeons breeding in natural sites do not share
this relative immunity. Many British pigeon-fanciers have a great
dislike of Feral Pigeons, particularly if they approach Rock-Pigeons
in appearance. Such men kill every ownerless Pigeon that comes into
their lofts, and often deliberately decoy them down for this purpose.
Man destroys many of the Pigeon's natural enemies in his own
interests, real or supposed. It seems likely, however, that even if
he gave such enemies a free hand, the Feral Pigeons would show only
slight diminution of numbers, and this would consist for the most part
of inexperienced juveniles and birds suffering from disease, malnutri-
tion, or injury. These latter often drag out a miserable existence
for months or even years in districts--such as inner London--where
predators are rare.
Much of the food of " town " Pigeons is deliberately given to them
by man. Thus the subjective feelings of pity, friendliness, or com-
passion which they evoke in man (or woman) is of the utmost biological
importance to them. The relative slowness of peristalsis in this species,

largely with bird-protection of a sentimental nature, carrying advertisements for a
contrivance designed to cripple any Pigeon or other " unwanted " bird alighting on it !

and the resultant posturings as the hungry bird with gullet over-full
(but crop and stomach probably empty) endeavours to avoid having

superficial observer consider them as extremely " greedy As a
result of this, and perhaps also of official anti-pigeon propaganda,

some of the people who feed the birds in London's parks make every
endeavour to prevent the Pigeons obtaining any of their bounty.
Even in country districts, Feral Pigeons are largely dependent, albeit
indirectly, on man, since most of their feeding grounds are produced
by his activities. The same is true to some extent of Rock-Pigeons.
A study of the feeding ecology of Rock-Pigeons in areas where they
do not use man-made feeding grounds would be of utmost interest.
Feeding Ecology .
From this aspect Feral Pigeons can be roughly grouped into two
main classes ; those feeding in the countryside and those feeding
inside towns. In their feeding habits the first group do not differ
from such Dovecote Pigeons or Rock-Pigeons as may be getting their
living in the same area. Feral Pigeons dwelling in cliffs, ruined
buildings (in the country), old barns, quarries, and similar places get
their food outside the towns, but the converse is not always true.
In some towns all or part of the Pigeon population may fly out into
the surrounding country to feed, returning to roost and nest on the
buildings. The same individuals may--though not very commonly--
feed both inside the town's streets and in the surrounding fields.
Food is sought on the ground. Pigeons normally alight to look for
food only where the earth is either bare or covered only with short or
scanty vegetation. Cultivated land, particularly arable fields and
stubbles, is usually chosen where available. Fields of hay and corn
are visited as soon as they have been cut, but the birds do not often
settle among standing corn, as does the Wood-Pigeon (Columba
palumbus). They may come into stackyards and about farm buildings,
particularly if Domestic Pigeons are kept there. They may even under
certain circumstances (Naumann, 1833) feed in woodlands on the
fallen seeds of conifers and other trees. Exceptionally they may feed

in trees on growing buds or berries. This I have only seen in Kensing-
ton Gardens, but it has also (Szemere, 1948) been recorded in Hungary. ;
This is probably an acquired habit which perhaps originated by a j
bird which had perched in a tree to rest, observing a Wood-Pigeon
or some other bird feeding.
Besides seeds of many kinds, some of the more quiescent forms of I
animal life are also taken, particularly small snails. Cultivated grain
(especially wheat) and pulse and the seeds of vetches are favourite
foods. In Kensington Gardens they habitually search for and eat
such acorns as are, or can be, broken up. Naumann (1833) observed
Pigeons swallowing whole acorns. This I have never seen, and all
my efforts to get the Kensington Garden birds to do so have been
in vain. That they are perfectly capable, physically, of swallowing
and digesting small whole acorns I have proved by feeding them to
a young one that I was hand-rearing, whilst it was still at the stage
when it would blindly swallow anything I put into its mouth. For
a comprehensive list of foods taken by Feral and Dovecote Pigeons in
Germany and by Rock-Pigeons in Scotland, the reader is referred to
Naumann (1833) and Macgillivray (1837).
Feral Pigeons living in towns often, and in England usually, feed
inside the town itself. Some natural food is obtained from exposed
earth or grass plots in parks and gardens, but the greater part consists,
as a rule, of bread or other artificial food which is given to them by the
public, or obtained by scavenging. Large numbers congregate in
parks and squares where they are regularly fed. Others seek food
in the roads, railway stations, dockyards, and so forth. Grain spilled
from horses' nose-bags once constituted an important food source,
but owing to the decline in horse-traffic it is now a negligible one in
most places. Bread is usually the staple food, since being cheaper it is
given in greater quantity than any other, but grain, pulse, peanuts,
or cheese are always taken in preference except by individuals that
have not learnt that these substances are edible. Cooked meat, fat,
bacon rind, apple, potato, chocolate, and other sweetmeats are also
eaten, at least by some individuals. The need for lime, especially
by breeding birds, prompts them to eat the mortar from buildings.
This they can only do where it is already sufficiently loose and crumbled
for their weak bills to detach pieces of suitable size. The popular
idea, largely spread by professional pigeon-killers with an axe to grind,
that they are capable of harming sound buildings in this way is, of
course, ludicrous.
Feeding Behaviour and Recognition of Food.
It would be of great interest to know to what extent (1) likely feeding
grounds, and (2) food, are recognized innately. Normally the young
Pigeon follows older birds to the feeding areas. Similarly adult birds

are often attracted to new feeding grounds by seeing other pigeons
flying to or alighting on them. In any flock there are usually
experienced birds who will probably " recollect " previous experience
at sight of a new-cut stubble, new-sown cornfield, or other man-made
feeding ground. A pigeon usually remembers any place where it has
found food and returns to it again next time it is hungry. It seems
that, in the absence of the greater stimulus of experienced birds going
elsewhere, Pigeons instinctively alight on relatively bare ground and
away from the immediate vicinity of trees when seeking food. It seems
certain that they have an innate tendency to go to the ground when
hungry, for hand-reared young ones that have never been fed at ground level
will do so if left without food. Probably nobody would have thought
of putting food for pigeons in the many barren town squares where
they are fed, had not hungry birds first alighted in them to search
for food.
Pigeons feeding in open country commonly set off for their feeding
grounds in flocks, although they may do so singly or in the company
of only one or two others. They usually fly fairly low, and on arriving
at the feeding ground alight either at once or after some preliminary
circling. This latter hesitation is due to the birds being somewhat
afraid to alight or undecided exactly where to do so. It is not a
deliberate attempt to make sure that no enemy is concealed near by.
Such hesitation is seldom shown if the birds are very familiar with
the feeding place, or if there are other Pigeons already feeding there.
Once on the ground the birds walk about rapidly with heads down,
peering closely as they go, and stopping or turning aside to pick up
anything edible they see. In loose friable earth, leaf-mould, chaff,
etc., pigeons (all species of Columba and Streptopelia whose feeding
behaviour is known as well as the present species) will search for
buried seeds by turning over the substrate with their bills. The bird
uses a quick sideways flicking movement of the head, whereby some
of the loose earth is thrown to one side. Although less like the normal
movement of picking up food, and hence one might suppose more
specialized, this movement does not seem any more efficient than
the " pecking with closed bill 55 of gallinaceous birds. Pigeons do not
often dig in this manner except where they have already found some
grains or have been accustomed to find them.
Homing Pigeons and Flying Pigeons that are allowed their liberty
frequently go into the fields to feed in spite of regular and plentiful
supplies of food. This habit most often starts when they are feeding-
young. They are generally believed--probably correctly--to do so in
search of snails and other animal food. If this is so, it suggests an
innate urge to seek such foods--which are not normally sought after--
even though the diet supplied is sufficient to rear apparently perfect
young. Any reader who keeps Homing Pigeons which have not

hitherto " gone fielding " could make valuable observations by
noting full details about its first occurrence, where the birds first alight,
and what appeared to induce them to do so.
Pigeons feed by preference mostly on seeds, which are swallowed
whole. There would seem to be no possibility of a sense of taste in
any way similar to our own, giving the bird clues as to the edibility
of new objects. Adult pigeons make no attempt to " show " food to
their offspring at any stage. The method of parental feeding does
not enable the young one to see the food it swallows, and under normal
conditions the young pigeon does not appear actively to seek food
until the parents have ceased to feed it.
A young Pigeon will, if hungry, and if no creature from whom it
is accustomed to be fed is within sight, commence to peck at all sorts

of small objects that contrast to some degree with the substrate.
These are picked up, held a moment in the tip of the bill, and dropped
again. If some edible seeds, such as grains of wheat or dari, are found,
the bird will almost invariably eat them. The first grain to be eaten
will, however, be picked up and dropped again many times before it is
finally swallowed. The second will be taken with much less hesitation,
and the third--if the young Pigeon is really very hungry--probably
with none at all. Whatever items are first swallowed will, at this first
meal, be taken exclusively until they are all gone. This behaviour
does not seem to be on quite the same plane of trial and error as the
feeding of young game-bird chicks, since the young Pigeon does not
usually swallow inedible substances. It may indeed refuse--even
though starving--to eat many palatable foods at this stage.
If other Pigeons are present when the young one first starts to
feed itself, its behaviour is somewhat different. It shows interest the
moment it sees another Pigeon pick up food. The young bird at once
runs to it, looks eagerly when it pecks again, and tries--always

realize that other similar grains, over which it may be treading as it
tries to seize the one in its unwitting mentor's bill, are equally so.
Suddenly (perhaps as a result of clearly seeing the actual morsel the
other picked up) realization comes, and the young Pigeon starts to eat,
usually with much less hesitation over the first grain than it would
have shown had it been " learning to feed " alone. None of the
hesitation shown by the young Pigeon at this stage is due to insufficient
maturation of the innate feeding movements. In a natural or feral
state the young one does not feed itself until after it can fly well, and
has left the nest. It can, however, as every pigeon-keeper knows, be
taught to eat freely long before it can fly, by placing a supply of corn
beside the nest, so that it constantly sees its parents feeding themselves.
Also adult Pigeons confronted with some food new to them behave in
the same manner except that they are--other things being equal--
usually " quicker on the uptake ". There is much individual variation
in the speed of both adults and young when " learning " new foods.
Pigeons do not learn to eat bread so readily as they will seeds.
Nevertheless, they soon do so if they are famishing and other Pigeons
are eating it. Chopped-up cooked meat, another unnatural food like
bread, but one that is given very little by the public, has been learnt
by very few Pigeons (in London, at any rate) which will leave bread
to scramble for it whilst the majority ignore meat if there are known
foods, such as bread, available. Pigeons always " learn " more quickly
to take strange seeds of small size--millet, dari, wheat, canary seed,
hemp, etc.--than larger ones such as maize, tic beans, or shelled
peanuts. This bears no relation to their choice when u experienced ".
It is difficult to see the utility of this behaviour. It can hardly be to
guard against the ingestion of unsuitable food, since once it has
convinced itself of the edibility of some new food and swallowed the
first morsel, the Pigeon will always continue to eat. Thus it will--if
there is enough available--consume as great a bulk of a food consisting
of small particles as of larger.
Since the war the Pigeons in inner London have been fed chiefly
with bread. Knowing that Pigeons that have once learned to eat
them usually take peanuts in preference to other foods, I experimented
by giving peanuts and millet to many different groups of London's
Pigeons. It was obvious that the birds had no previous experience
of millet. Its unfamiliar appearance when thrown to them often
made them fly up in alarm and show fear when approaching the
millet-strewn ground. Most have, however, eaten the millet after

only the briefest hesitant " picking up and dropping " and with two
exceptions (out of very many hundreds tried), all the individuals
to whom it was offered ate it within a few moments of the first birds
to do so commencing. With peanuts (shelled but whole) the results
have been otherwise. Of the birds which obviously did not " know "
peanuts, many have refused them, often after picking them up several
times. The majority of Wood-Pigeons to which I offered peanuts
would not even pick them up, although the very few that " knew "
them took them eagerly in preference to anything else. To my
astonishment, a starving young Wood-Pigeon, so weakened by hunger
that it tottered and stumbled repeatedly and showed no escape
reactions, repeatedly refused to swallow even broken-up peanuts
(which inexperienced pigeons take at first more readily than whole
ones, because of size), although repeatedly seizing them eagerly when
thrown to it and lifting and dropping them. This bird could not have
been flying more than three weeks, it had learnt to eat bread, but had
evidently not succeeded in finding sufficient food.
A young Feral Pigeon which fell from its nest (in South Kensington)
when about three weeks old, was hand-reared, chiefly on milk-sop,
wheat, peanuts, and millet, although it was also fed small amounts
of meat, cheese, crushed egg-shell, grit, and acorns. After it had
reached the age when it would normally have been fully independent
(I had deliberately made no attempts to encourage or coerce it into
feeding itself) it would no longer let itself be fed sop (which nestling
pigeons take more eagerly than dry grain), closing and withdrawing
its bill if it felt sop in my hand, but opening it and gulping eagerly if
it felt grain or peanuts. At this period it began to pick up and swallow
wheat or millet grains that were spilled during feeding. When I
" pecked " at a peanut with my finger the bird immediately showed
interest, but I had to repeat the process for several days running
before it at last swallowed one of its own accord. Thereafter they
became its favourite food. It did not eat bread--in spite of attempts
to make it do so extending over several weeks--until I had kept it
without food for some thirty hours. During this time bread, suitably
broken up, had been available in dishes from which it habitually fed,
but had been untouched. The bird was by then very hungry, but by
no means near starvation point, and after a great deal of finger tapping
and proffering bread in my hand, I at last persuaded it to eat a little.
This specimen had come from a bread-fed population and the relative
slowness with which it learned to eat this food suggests--as does
observation of their condition--that the majority of " squeakers 99 in
London are actually starving when they first learn to feed themselves.
The same may be true for wild pigeons.
The above examples (and many similar ones that might be quoted)
suggest that seeds from about millet to pea size present C. livia with

innately recognized visual and possibly also tactile stimuli. Such
foods as bread seem to supply no such stimuli. Most Pigeons first
begin to eat them through the example of others. Some individuals
may learn to eat such foods either through extreme hunger inducing
them to sample it or because it is offered by a human being from
whom they are conditioned to expect edible gifts. Initially some bird
or birds in each area must have learnt to eat bread in some such
manner. Nevertheless, Pigeons that are starving may, in the absence
of others which take them , refuse such foods as bread and peanuts if they
have never seen them before. This they may do after repeatedly
picking them up, holding them in the tip of the bill, and dropping
them, thus showing that this behaviour pattern is not--as it often
appears to be--a means by which a Pigeon can deduce the edibility
of any object. It is true that Pigeons often discard bad grains (of a
species they are accustomed to eat) after such treatment, but this may
be due to the bird appreciating the difference between the visual and
the tactile stimuli after it has learnt what " good " grains look and
feel like. Jays ( Garrulus sp.) and Wood-Pigeons will at once discard
a bad acorn after similar treatment.
The eating of and apparently deliberate searching for invertebrate
life sometimes shown by Pigeons that are feeding young, suggests an
innate impulse to find such food and to be able to recognize it when
found. It would be interesting to know whether this is a result of
the birds being in a certain phase of the reproductive cycle or whether
it depends on the diet being deficient, to some degree at least, of food
elements needed at this period. I have noticed that captive Pigeons
of many species are eager for such foods as cheese, cooked egg, and
milk-sop when they have young. A pair of Turtle Doves ( Streptopelia
turtur) which I kept many years ago, and on which I made no precise
or written observation, fed chiefly if not entirely on seeds except when
feeding young, at which time they ate quantities of milk sop. A pair
of Palm Doves (caught as adults) which I kept in Egypt (Goodwin,
1947) fed entirely on maize until they hatched their young, when
they commenced to take broken-up peanuts and lentils--both foods
of high protein content--as well. Whitman (1919) found that most
of his pigeons would eat earthworms at this period, possibly their diet
was somewhat faulty and the many weaknesses which he ascribed to
hybrid ancestry may not always have had this as a sole cause. I have
never known pigeons eat earthworms--though I have offered them to
many species--but I strongly suspect that the London Wood-Pigeons
do so.
The eating of greenfood (leaves and shoots of various plants) may
perhaps often be due to an otherwise deficient diet. I have never seen
Pigeons in the country eating greenstuff and none of the Domestic
Pigeons I have kept have eaten it except in very small quantities.

On the other hand I have seen Domestic Pigeons that would devour
cabbage, lettuce, and other greenstuff avidly. Some in the Cairo
Zoo during the w r ar years appeared to be fed on nothing but white :
maize, and these poor birds would fly madly to the wire to devour
anything green offered to them, swallowing leaves, stalks of dandelions,
and so on, in a manner unlike anything I have seen before or since.
Roosting , Nesting , and Related Behaviour.
Rock-Pigeons nest and roost in caves. Where available sea-caves
appear to be preferred, probably a result of selection through survival,
because persecution by man has fallen less heavily on populations in
such sites. The nest is placed either on a ledge in a cave, or, less
often, in a hole or crevice in the cliff-face. The nest-site is often in
semi-darkness and usually well inside the cave. Little detailed
evidence about roosting is available. On Fetlar, in the Shetland
Isles, I was shown a very large, almost cathedral-like cave, from the
roof of which depended large sloping ledges of rock. There was no
place in this cave where a Pigeon could have nested, yet large numbers
had evidently used it as a roosting place for many years. None were
" at home " when I visited it (on an afternoon in late June, 1954),
and it is possible that it was only used by non-breeding birds. In a
small dark sea-cave occupied by an incubating pair, the cock roosted
on a ledge near the nest. Much remains to be found out about the
behaviour of the truly wild Pigeon, and a comparative study of feral
populations is equally desirable. In some parts of the world Rock-
Pigeons have taken to living in buildings. Where doing so their
habitat preferences do not seem to differ from those of Feral Pigeons.
The roosting and nesting places chosen by Feral Pigeons are, in
effect, the nearest artificial equivalents of natural sites. The girders
under bridges, church belfries, ruined buildings, large railway stations,
and old castles are commonly favourite haunts. Any sort of suitably
sized hole, nook, or sheltered ledge may be used for nesting. If they
fail to find any better place, a pair will sometimes nest on an exposed
ledge, usually without success. Although the favourite roosting
perch would seem to be the equivalent of " a ledge in a big cave " the
birds often roost regularly on ledges or roofs with no shelter from
above. They never roost " on the skyline " (although lost Homing
Pigeons may, exceptionally, do so), but always with a solid wall of
some sort on one side of them.
What are the essential " sign stimuli 55 that guide a Pigeon in its
selection of a nesting or roosting site ? That remains a question that
perhaps some of our members will be stimulated to solve, and I can
only offer some tentative suggestions. Pairs of Pigeons seeking a
nesting site seem strongly attracted to any conspicuous " dark
opening *\ I have often noticed in London that when new blocks of

flats are being built and have been nearly completed, but with empty
spaces where the windows will be, nest-seeking Pigeons frequently
enter them and attempt to breed. Whenever I have kept Domestic
Pigeons a pair has sooner or later found the open trap-door of the
garage loft--which from below appears a square black hole--and
nested therein. Whether height, as such, in a building or cliff has any
attraction for Pigeons--over and above that occasioned by its mere
conspicuousness--I do not know, but am inclined to doubt it. Height
after all is a relative matter, and the Rock Pigeon must usually after
foraging fly downwards when it returns to its cave. For the actual
nest itself, Pigeons like to get in some sort of hollow, or depression if
on a ledge, this obviously being related not only, or not so much, to
the greater security as to making the somewhat ill-constructed nest
4 4 stay put ". Taking advantage of this some pigeon-fanciers put
earthenware nest-bowls in large and bare nesting boxes, and birds nest
in them as the most suitable place available.
In contrast with the energy with which they will search for a suitable
nesting place, Feral Pigeons often seem to lack initiative over roosting
places. The many birds that one sees roosting night after night
exposed to wind and rain could in most cases find better places, but
once having established the habit of roosting in a particular place,
it never seems to occur to them to seek for a better one. They will,
however, often desert their roosting place if they are frightened at it by
man or some other predator. What causes apparently unsuitable
roosting places to be initially chosen is difficult to understand. Roosting
on exposed ledges seems to be rather more general with Feral Pigeons
of Homing Pigeon type and ancestry, but this may merely be because
these tend to be more numerous in smaller, newer, towns with relatively
few buildings that offer shelter. The disinclination to seek a fresh
roosting place, except under the stimulus of fear, is easily explicable.
So long as the bird remains alive and fit for reproduction, there will be
no selection against individuals that stick to an accustomed roost in
spite of discomfort. Indeed, since such a roost has for some time
44 proved safe " there may well be selection in their favour.
On the other hand there will be selection in favour of pairs that
show initiative in seeking a suitable nest site, since the apparent optimal
site for the adult--sheltered and in semi-darkness--is that where the
young are most likely to be successfully reared. It may be mentioned
that although in a pigeon-loft pairing often or usually takes place
through a hen being attracted by a cock 44 calling to nest ", yet it is
evident that in a feral state many pairs form prior to either partner
having secured a nest-site. Also one can, of course, pair a cock and
hen Domestic Pigeon just as surely (and a good deal more safely) by
leaving them free outside the loft together by themselves as by shutting
them in the male's nest-box.

The nesting behaviour of Pigeons is well-known and has been
described in some detail by many authors, correctly by Heinroth
(1948), and with varying degrees of inaccuracy by most others.
One point about the parental feeding, that so far as I recall is not
mentioned by Heinroth, should be discussed, as it applies equally to
other species of Columbidae , and is of importance to aviculturists.
The parent at first feeds the squabs with pigeon&amp;apos;s milk that forms in
the upper part of the crop. When they are a few days old it begins

also to regurgitate the food in its crop, of which the young can at this

age swallow only small or soft morsels. If one watches the parent
feeding one will see that after each regurgitation it re-swallows some
food in its gullet. At about four to five days old the squab's crop will
contain pigeon's milk plus some small seeds (if these have been
available to the adult), and perhaps some soft food or animal matter.
A little later the young one can and does swallow anything the parent
regurgitates.

The pigeon's milk, I suppose because it lies above the food in the
main part of the crop, is fed off first at each feed. If both squabs are
equally vigorous, both will get a share. Indeed, the parent often feeds
both at once (see sketch). But if one of the young is older or stronger
to a marked degree, it will usually be fed first. The weaker young
one will get little or no pigeon's milk, and although its crop may be
full after each feed, it will be malnourished. It will be weakly and
badly fret-marked if it survives at all, although it may improve after
fledging if food supplies are good. For the same reason a brood of
three is seldom, if ever, completely successful. These circumstances
are not likely to occur in a wild, or even a feral state, although excep-
tionally they may do so. But it will often happen that an aviculturist
may wish one pair of doves to rear other young without sacrificing
their own. In such cases I have found that if the weak young ones are
fed--additionally to the parental feeding--with egg custard, a few
mealworms and a very little chewed up lean meat, they will soon
start to thrive and thereafter progress normally.
Colour Varieties.
In this brief description of the colours most prevalent in Feral
Pigeons, I use the usual name given by pigeon-keepers in Britain.
Unfortunately, in some parts, and in America, different terms are
used for some colours.
Blue .--The natural colour of the Rock-Pigeon. General plumage
blue-grey, usually pale blue-grey on wings, and sometimes also on
underparts. Two conspicuous black bars across the wing, and a broad
black bar at end of tail. Rump usually white or pale grey, but often
same grey as rest of plumage. Neck and upper breast iridescent
green and purple. A very common colour among Feral and Homing
Pigeons.
Blue Chequer .--As in blue, but the wing bars wider and the rest of
the wing feathers with black markings (" chequering "), giving a
spotted effect. In dark blue chequers only a small grey mark may be
left on each feather, and the closed wing appears very dark. In such
birds the grey of the rest of the plumage is also darker, and the black
spotting may extend to rump and flanks. The commonest colour
among Feral and Homing Pigeons in Britain.
Velvet .--As dark blue chequer, but wing-coverts entirely black.
All the " blue " colours may show a chestnut or rusty tinge on the
black portions of the plumage, and may show a good deal of minor
variation in shade of grey, type of chequering, amount and colour of
neck gloss, and so on.
Mealy .--As in blue, but ground colour silvery or creamy grey,
neck and breast usually tinged brown and with green and purple
gloss, often rich chestnut-brown, head may be brown or mealy white,

Velvets. The " Red 55 colours are usually rather infrequent in Feral
Pigeons, except where these have been derived largely from Homing
Pigeons, in which these colours are frequent.
Grizzle. --A pattern, difficult to describe, in which all the feathers
are curiously streaked and intermixed with white. They vary from
the " light print " which is predominantly white with dark-tipped
primaries, and some dark feathers in its head and neck, through
various shades of grizzled grey (with darker wing bars), and the same
in the " red " colours. In juvenile plumage grizzles are usually
much paler than they will be after moulting.
Black. --The deep solid black found in some fancy Pigeons is rare
in feral birds. But specimens of a uniform slaty-black are not
uncommon.
Pieds. --Any of the colours mentioned may be pied, that is, marked
with white, the underparts, rump, primaries, and head being the
parts most often affected. Such birds are common among Feral
Pigeons in English towns. Gay-pieds--that is birds with more white
than coloured plumage, are rarer. Pure white birds--other than first
generation escapes--are most uncommon, although Gay-pieds coloured
only on tail and scapulars are much less so.
Silvers. --A dilute form of blue, ground colour silvery cream, with
grey-brown instead of black markings. Rather rare and, when they
occur in feral population, almost always females.
Barless Mealies. --The term is sufficient description. Not uncommon
(perhaps one in 2,000) in London.
Some other colours, such as mosaics occur very rarely (in feral
populations). Most of the colour varieties described are subject to
some variation. Thus blues may be " smoky ", a dull dark grey
ground colour on wing coverts ; " silver blue ", of a bright pale,
silvery hue ; " plummy " with pinkish eye-rims, a peculiar dulling of
the plumage and much non-iridescent wine-red colour on the upper
breast ; or " pencilled " with slight black marks along the vanes of
the wing-coverts. But it would have taken up too much space to
describe fully such minor variants of each colour phase.
Sexual Dimorphism and Juvenile Plumage.
In the Rock-Pigeon the visible sexual differences are slight, and the
birds are difficult to sex accurately from their appearance. Generally
the male has a slightly bolder head, and the iridescence on the neck
is more intense and often more extensive. In Homing Pigeons and
Feral Pigeons that approach them in type the male usually shows a
larger cere (" wattle " of pigeon-fanciers) at the base of the bill, and
his bill and head are altogether bolder and coarser-looking. But unless
one knows one is dealing with related birds this is often of little value.
Some strains of Homing Pigeons have much larger bills and wattles

than others, and a hen of such strain may be bigger and coarser than
a cock of another.
Pigeons of any of the " red " colours (I am talking now of Feral
and Homing Pigeons, not of fancy varieties specially bred for colour),
generally show a difference in colour by which they can be at once
correctly sexed if in adult plumage. Most males show small blue-grey
or black marks--like little streaks or splashes of ink in appearance--
on the webbing of the tail and wing quills. In the females these marks
if present at all, are brownish in colour. All the sons of a " red 55
hen Pigeon are always reds (mealies, red-pieds, red grizzles, red
chequers, etc.), unless they are albinos, no matter what colour male
she is paired to.
Juvenile Pigeons are generally duller than the adults, and have only
a very little iridescence on the neck feathers, which are not bifurcated
like the adults'. If they are going to have rich purplish colour or wine
colour on the upper breast, the feathers of these parts are tipped with
rusty brown. The " reds " are browner and more gingery than they

will be after moulting, the " blues " duller and often darker, the
chequers have their wing markings less distinct. Grizzles are usually
much paler and are often almost entirely white, it is surprising to see
the near-white juvenile moult into quite a dark bird, as it often does.
Young blues sometimes have the wing-coverts edged with dull whitish.
Sometimes a juvenile will show beautifully laced blackish or reddish
edges to the feathers of its wing-coverts. Such birds moult out, as a
rule, into very ordinary and unattractive " blue-pencils " or " straw-
berry mealies " (a sort of clouded pattern between a light red chequer
and a mealy).
The juvenile usually shows two areas on the wing (see sketch) where
the feathers--before it commences to moult--show the adult colour and
pattern. The feathers in these areas are indeed not exactly the colour
they will be, or rather will be replaced by after moulting, but they
are very close to it, and in the more deceptively-coloured juveniles
they enable one to guess pretty accurately what the bird will in fact
look like when adult.

The young birds have dark greyish--sometimes nearly black--legs
and feet, and their eyes are also dull and greyish in colour at first.
In young white (albino) Pigeons the feet are pale salmon colour,
although adult albinos have the same purplish red feet as other
colours.

By Dorothy A. Jakobsson (Ferndown, Dorset, England)
The best and least expensive way, in our opinion, for safeguarding
one's birds from little wild creatures is to maintain a bodyguard
of well-fed neuter cats. I stress well fed, as no weary, ill-nourished
animal will delight in the sport of the chase. It may catch a stray
mouse for food--if spry enough--and there the matter ends. My cats
bring me in rats, stoats, weasels, mice, or young rabbits daily, and take
no notice whatsoever of the doves when prowling around the aviaries.
I am afraid they occasionally catch a wild bird, then what right have
we to say them nay, who breed birds merely for food, or box hens in
tiny cages that they may produce more eggs for our pleasure !
Lewes, Muezza, and Tangy Tim are real pets, and while always
having access to the house and a cosy corner beside the fire in which
to sleep, frequently toil out through rain or snow and bring home
their catch in due season.

My aviaries are merely raised--on a foundation--a couple of bricks
high, never once have I lost a bird through rats and the like. I must
mention though that the actual sleeping quarters--where the doves
are fed--are three feet up from the ground. All the aviaries are
surrounded thickly with flowering shrubs, and the grass during
flowering time is hay-high, giving perfect cover to any wild creature
seeking such protection. Water also abounds in the vicinity--pools,
a small stream, and boggy land near-by.
Perhaps it is not generally known that an old law--never repealed--
still exists whereby anyone can be fined 5^. for not keeping a cat if
a near-by householder can prove the vermin doing the damage came
from the former's premises. Of course, in this age of high sounding
phrases, the offence is termed " for not taking proper care in the
destruction of obnoxious vermin ". In days agone, it was so judged
that a person might not have the money with which to buy mouse
traps, but a cat could always be kept, and as it could be maintained,
in the main, from table scraps there was absolutely no excuse for not
having one.
Is this the real reason, I wonder, why cats are still untaxed when
almost everything else upon the earth is ?

SOME REFLECTIONS OF A SOFTBILL
ENTHUSIAST

<bodyText confidence="0.982648944444445" page_id="56238396"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
For nearly twenty years I have kept quite a number of softbills
year in and year out without interruption. So much effort, time,
money, and above all, regard for the birds, have gone into this pastime
that I should like to pass on a few of my reflections and reminiscences
to other interested persons, in the hope that they may prove interesting
as well as informative, and perhaps even helpful in some way.
Prior to moving into the beautiful San Fernando Valley in 1932,
I had never kept softbills or, in fact, any kind of birds, except pigeons,
which usually do not come under this classification. I well remember
my modest beginnings : I started off with, of all creatures, foreign
doves, getting a pair of Diamond Doves and other small varieties from
the late Mr. Eighmey, of Costa Mesa, a dealer and a birdlover. Soon
after, I obtained a variety of small finches, whose behaviour, however,
seemed rather stereotyped to furnish continuous and lively interest for
me over a period of years. Soon my attention was directed to singing
softbills advertised in various domestic and foreign bird and pet
journals. Then the fun--and also some work--began.
Happily do I recall my first softbill, a beautiful Shama Thrush,

supplied to me by the firm of Louis Ruhe in New York City. So eagerly
did I look forward to this bird's arrival that I telephoned the railway
express office half a dozen times in an attempt to ascertain its exact
arrival either in Los Angeles or in Van Nuys. Finally, when word
came that the bird had arrived in Van Nuys, a suburb of Sherman
Oaks, I left my work in Los Angeles early and quickly in order to claim
the precious bird shipment without further delay. When I got the
shipping box home and opened it, the Shama hopped sprightly out of
it and into the wire-cage I had readied for him, greeting me right then
with a lovely little tune. This sort of greeting evidenced that the bird
was in good health and apparently not at all fatigued from the four-day
journey en route from New York to California. In those days no air-
express service for birds was available. That first Shama proved to be
one of the finest songsters it has been my pleasure and privilege to
keep. But what pleased, even fascinated, me almost as much as his
excellent singing was his cockiness and inclination to fight, his swiftness
of flight in the room where he was kept (he was let out of the cage
once a day for bathing and exercise), and his growing tameness and
friendliness. All these attributes pointed to a bird possessed of over-
flowing energy, charm, and " personality ". I shall always remember
with delight the utter joyousness of the musical calls and whistles of
that first Shama--in fact, I can hear them now as I type these lines.
Alert from early morning until late evening, that handsome bird took
notice of everything that went on within his view. Let a stranger
approach, even at a distance, or a strange noise be heard, and the
Shama would sound his sharp alarm note, whipping his long, beautiful
tail all the while and scolding. Every day this bird would bathe in
a large aluminium pan set outside his cage. He lived in apparent
perfect health for three years, dying suddenly one forenoon of a stroke.
Though greatly saddened by this Shama's passing, his unforgettable
charm prompted me forthwith to try my luck with other softbills.
In the summer of 1933 there came a Clarino, or Solitaire--all the
way from Brownsville, Texas, in a dirty little uncovered wire cage
containing a few dried-up berries. In English and in German books
I had read of the quite unusual, clarinet-like music made by this plain,
brown-coloured bird, a specimen of which I had neither seen nor heard
before. Acute was my disappointment when reluctantly I signed for
the shipment at the express office, for the Clarino was in bad condition
owing, no doubt, to lack of food and water. Head tucked in his wing-
feathers, he was sitting listlessly in the bottom of the dirty cage as if
resigned to an early demise. When I arrived home with the bird, I
soon found that he was much too weak either to eat or to drink ; so
in order to save him, if at all possible, I forced a few drops of lukewarm
milk down his throat, repeating the process--a rather delicate one for
a beginner like me--at numerous intervals. It was my first experience

<bodyText confidence="0.999491022222222" page_id="56238398"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
with forcing a bird to drink, but it was effective, for the bird began
slowly to take an interest in his surroundings, but still he would not
touch the soft-food mixture I had prepared for him. So, having read
that Clarinos are fond of flies, I got busy at once and caught flies,
numbers of them, till it got too dark--and I was greatly encouraged
by the bird's taking them at first gingerly, then eagerly. By evening
the Solitaire's plumage was almost smooth, and he did not bury his
head in his wing-feathers any longer. I felt I had won the battle--with,
of course, the bird's co-operation. Next morning, I looked after the
Solitaire the very first thing, finding him quite well and willing to take
mealworms and other food. Day after day this luminous-eyed bird
improved, and it was not a week before he began to sing his flute-like
melody which somehow carried me back to the stillness of the High
Sierras, where I had journeyed in my younger days and where
Solitaires usually build their nests in the shadow of waterfalls. So
utterly different from any other bird's song was the Solitaire's that
I could hardly trust my ears, for I did not know that any bird was
capable of making such exquisite music. Though not as active as the
Shama, and certainly not as nervous, this Solitaire, being easily cared
for, became tame quickly. He especially relished freshly caught flies
and moths, but he would also take mealworms.
These two good songsters constituted the beginning of my softbill
venture, which to date has brought me many, many joys and occasional
disappointments. Twenty years ago I was pretty ignorant of such birds'
food requirements, even though I had made it my business right from
the beginning to purchase and consult English and German authorities'
writings on this subject. It seemed that in Europe during the greater
part of the year, live ant-eggs constituted the principal food of captive
softbills. It was asserted that they were so complete and effective in
nutritive values as to satisfy almost any softbill's requirements com-
pletely--no additional foods being needed. But here in America live
ant-eggs were not available. Of course, I eagerly read advertisements
concerning various softbill food mixtures, purchasing this and that
mixture in order to determine its merits. Always it was maintained
that the food was " complete "--meaning that the bird fed with it
required no other food, except perhaps a few live mealworms once or
twice a day. Soon, however, I learned that my softbills did not like the
commercial Mockingbird food, that they ate but very little of it, and
that their general condition was not noticeably improved by it.
Moreover, the birds would sing but little or not at all on this mono-
tonous diet--to me a sure sign that their daily food lacked something
quite essential.
So gradually I began to experiment by adding certain items to the
soft-food, such as moistening it thoroughly with freshly grated raw
carrot or sweet apple, enriching it with finely chopped hard-boiled

egg, boiled beefheart, or dried ant-eggs, first soaked in warm milk.
I learned also that tastes of softbills differ widely, and that at times it
requires considerable time and patience to accustom any softbill to
a food he has not eaten before. I had often read in various foreign
books that milksop was relished by certain species of softbills. However,
my birds would have none of it--until I placed pieces of cut-up meal-
worms atop the milksop, so that every time the bird reached for a piece
of mealworm, he also got a good taste of the milksop. By and by I gave
the milksop without any worms--and it was taken. It consisted of
spongecake and some Pablum soaked in fresh, sweet milk, with some
honey added. This mixture is a much-relished daily food of such birds
as orioles, honeycreepers, flycatchers, and thrushes. I give it to them
fresh once a day.
Though rather ignorant of many essential aspects of successful
softbill keeping, I managed with the aid of good books to learn much
about it. I soon found that Europe had a corner, so to speak, on dyed-
in-the-wool softbill enthusiasts. All the worthwhile books on this
subject were published in Europe. When it came to keeping in good
health for long periods of time even the most delicate wrens, warblers,
and flycatchers, English and German fanciers seemed to be the
experts. They, so I read, had been at it for years and years. Their
magazines and books were filled with fascinating, practical experience
articles on softbill keeping and training, while ours in America were
almost wholly devoted to information pertaining to hardbills. More-
over, I soon learned that most American bird-fanciers consider the
keeping of softbills, whether in cages or in aviaries, as entailing far too
much trouble in feeding and in cleaning. Moreover, they usually wish
their hobbies to pay expenses. Since it is practically impossible to raise
softbills in captivity in appreciable number and since the market for
them is limited, most American birdmen and women much prefer to
keep finches and parrotlike birds, which breed more or less freely in
captivity and which can be sold readily to other fanciers or to dealers.
So, taking everything into consideration, the best I could do in
caring for my softbills was to rely on the printed suggestions found in
British and German books and papers. Avicultural Magazine,
Cage Birds , and Die Gefiederte Welt --in those early years of my hobby
--frequently brought articles on how best to care for certain, more or
less delicate, softbills. Moreover, I obtained some sound help from
several fellow fanciers in California, in particular Alex Isenberg and
Eric Kinsey, both of whom maintain to this day quite extensive
collections of softbills, the former specializing mainly in foreign, the
latter mainly in domestic species. Both, however, live five hundred
miles distant. Detailed letters describing the various and ingenious
foods supplied captive domestic softbills, received from Eric Kinsey,

and a subsequent visit to his aviaries, proved quite enlightening, as did
a visit also to Alex Isenberg's avian establishment.
It was inevitable that in the beginning of my softbill hobby I should
make blunders, resulting largely from giving the wrong foods. Thus,
a disastrous blunder I made was to feed a delicate, wren-like bird quite
a number of mealworms on the advice of a Japanese bird-dealer in
Los Angeles from whom I had purchased the lively creature. If
I remember correctly, the bird was a Japanese Wren. At any rate, it
was modestly coloured--brown all over, tiny, and very, very lively.
A J apanese woman who was in the store at the time of my purchase,
gave an imitation of the bird's call which, to the best of my recollection,
was something like " Uguisu, Uguisu ! " Sorry to relate, the bird did
not utter these--or any other--notes while he was in my possession,
where he lived but three or four days. Had I cut the mealworms into
small pieces or had I soaked them in warm water to soften the hard
shells, this charming, vivacious wren might have been mine to enjoy
and to care for a long time. It could not, of course, digest the hard-
shelled worms. For days the loss of this rare little bird saddened me.
Hard as I tried to obtain another specimen--they cost $15 which at
that time was a good price--such was not to be had since but few had
been imported from the Orient. The loss of this bird taught me an
important lesson--carefully to adapt the kind and the texture of the
food, be it in natural or in commercial form, to the needs of each
individual bird. Different softbills have different tastes and these
manifest themselves in a variety of preferred foods. It is up to their
keeper to determine as best he can, what foods keep certain birds in
sound condition year in and year out. If he is genuinely concerned
about the welfare of his feathered charges--wants to see them healthy
and happy day in and day out--he will constantly endeavour to find
new items of food and new food combinations, trying them out very
carefully and gradually so that his birds' digestive mechanisms may
adjust themselves readily to them, and without any ill after-effects. In
other words, the new food or foods are given in addition to the regular
daily menu and the birds are left to try them out themselves. It was
in this manner that I learned that most of my softbills like peanut
butter very much. Now I keep jars of this nutritious item in every
aviary the year round. Even my foreign doves take peanut butter with
gusto. But Indian flycatchers, Yuhinas, and shrike, added recently to
my little collection, have not touched the peanut butter as yet. They
no doubt will in due course of time. I never thought that softbills
such as, for instance, Golden-fronted Fruitsuckers would eat fresh
lettuce. Nevertheless, such is the case with mine--as well as with other
softbills. It must be quite tasty to these birds because they have been
in my aviaries for many years, a number of them for fifteen years, and
quite a few over ten years. Recently I " discovered " pecan-meal as

<bodyText confidence="0.999258888888889" page_id="56238401"  page_num="219" year="" vol="">
making an excellent addition to the softbill mixture. Finely ground, it
is easily mixed with the other items. The birds eat it readily and
apparently it does them good. Not long ago I read an advertisement
offering wingless fruit flies ( drosophila) to fish fanciers. I purchased
several cultures of these small flies in glass bottles some weeks ago, and
I have been feeding the flies daily to a pair of jaunty Yuhinas. They
make a lot of " musical fuss " the moment I place a dish with fifty or
more of the tiny flies in their cage and they eat them in a hurry. I am
convinced that these flies would serve as an excellent live food also for
wrens, sunbirds, and humming birds, even though the two last
mentioned might prefer flies that can fly. But my Canyon Wren takes
them avidly. Since these wingless flies, feeding on decaying fruit,
multiply fast, they are easily and quickly raised in numbers. In all
softbill feeding, it is self-evident that the more natural we can constitute
the daily diet, the more conducive it is likely to be to the birds' health
and general well-being. Live food being the most important item in
most softbills' natural diet, I make it my business to take every spider,
moth, butterfly, angleworm, beetle, etc., to my birds the moment
I catch it--take it, mind you, with a sort of boyish triumph as if I were
bringing them an unusual delicacy--and maybe I am ! Always I find
certain birds requiring some extra attention, extra care, extra food.
Softbills exude individuality. My business is to cater to this charming
trait in every possible way. Years ago I learned that giving my birds
extra attention pays large dividends--in improved health of the birds,
in more and better singing, in greater tameness and friendliness. Over
the years certain birds, such as a Solitaire, a fruitsucker, a Shama,
and a wren, simply expect extra service from me. They fly to me the
moment I approach their cage or enter their abode, begging for titbits,
which usually they get. I try never to forget that my birds are my
responsibility--my very deserving responsibility !
But to return briefly to one of my main topics--initial blunders.
Another blunder, one that I made several times, caused me consider-
able chagrin. A fellow birdlover (?), calling at my aviaries, would
persuade me to let him have this or that bird, which he wanted
" oh, so terribly much ! " Twice I have given in to such pleas, only to
be very much disappointed some weeks later by the report that this
person, not finding the birds to his liking, disposed of them on short
notice and without making any sincere effort to learn their good
qualities and to fit them into his collection. In this connection my
many years of keeping softbills have made me sensitive to the birds'
feelings and reactions, perhaps too much so. Softbills' feelings, it seems
to me, are very easily upset. Being captive, they must endure so much
fear from man, so much cruelty--directly and indirectly.
Take the average softbill. First of all, it is trapped in its wild
habitat, stuck in a small box or cage, shipped over long and noisy

distances, then caught again, only to be again transferred from cage
to cage and aviary to aviary. Its whole life pattern is being changed
by this process, changed suddenly, often ruthlessly. The bird has to
change many of his habits to conform to his keeper's whims and
wishes. It is in constant fear of being caught up, dashing against
cage-bars or aviary wire in a mad attempt to escape the grasping hand
or enveloping net. No wonder that many softbills (and hardbills, too)
require months, if indeed not years, to recover from such maltreatment.
Some of them never recover, shown partly by the fact that they simply
will not sing or breed in captivity, not only because they are wholly out
of their accustomed milieu , but because they are mentally and physically
shocked. Other softbills regain, after a time, their ability to sing,
provided they are given humane treatment and patient care.
When one considers the fear which captive birds are subjected to,
especially when caught up and transported, one finds it difficult indeed
to justify the hobby of keeping such live birds as softbills. Many birds
simply die from the effects of fear--the strain is too much for
their delicate constitutions. Assuredly, the hobby of keeping softbills
is in most cases nothing more than just that--a hobby, a personal
pastime. It has practically no so-called scientific aspects or values.
To be sure, occasionally this or that, more or less rare, species of softbill
is successfully raised in captivity, and a general account of its breeding
is reported and published in the avian press. But in many instances
this account is far too general, too superficial to disclose essential habits
of either parent birds or youngsters, or both. A report of such habits
to have even the semblance of scientific character and value, would
have to be based on continuous, day-in and day-out, very thorough
observation of certain birds' behaviour. But such thorough-going
observations are foreign to most keepers of softbills since, apparently,
their recording would entail too much concentrated effort and writing.
If, then, a species of foreign softbill has been induced to breed in
captivity, and does so successfully, by all means let its owner report
this success--but as a personal achievement more or less, not as a
scientific one. And let such report be written from the standpoint of
the hobbyist so that other hobbyists may benefit from it. It is regret-
table that so many keepers of softbills cannot or will not communicate
their observations and experiences through the printed word to other
like-minded men and women. Go through the issues of this magazine,
for example, and count the number of articles devoted to softbill-
keeping and you will find few of them, not because softbills are
not kept by many people and often in considerable numbers, but
because their owners are reluctant to report on their collections, often
greatly underestimating the value of their observations and their
experience.
I have kept softbills for nearly twenty years--and I keep them to-day

<bodyText confidence="0.995417088888889" page_id="56238403"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
--for one principal reason--their ability to sing. So I more or less
confine my hobby to obtaining male birds of singing species and try
to induce them by means of good care to entertain and inspire me with
their songs. To me it is a never-failing, joyous surprise to hear a
recently acquired bird sing for the first time. Shama and Dhyal
Thrushes have, on the whole, proved my finest songsters, followed by
European Nightingales, White-Cheeked Jay-Thrushes (really whistlers)
European Blackbirds, and many other species. Freshly imported
softbills, if not frightened out of their wits by frequent and rough
handling in transport, will sometimes sing soon after arrival in my
aviaries. Some, however, will require a season or two of acclimatizing
and adjusting to new surroundings and of freeing themselves, so to
speak, from shock before they will sing at all. In captivity some soft-
bills' ability to sing will improve from year to year. The exact reason
for this condition I do not know, unless it be due to a more nutritious
and eminently regular diet than that obtained by birds which are at
liberty and on their own, and perhaps also to an increased feeling of
cc at-homeness ". Anyhow, I have learned that it pays to give a bird
ample time--a year or more--in which to prove his singing ability.
In certain instances he may need that much time to recover from the
effects of fright induced by having been caught, boxed up, and shipped
--to him thoroughly fearful and wholly unnatural experiences.
Whether to keep softbills in cages or in aviaries is assuredly a
debatable matter. It depends largely, so it would seem to me, on the
specific purpose for which the birds have been acquired and for which
they are meant to be kept. If that purpose is to tame a softbill quickly
and convert him into a pet or to observe his habits at close range over
a period of time, then the cage is by all odds the proper enclosure for
the bird. If, on the other hand, a softbill is to lend avian atmosphere
to a piece of wired-in outdoors, or to breed, then the aviary is the
proper place for him. Planted aviaries are best for most softbills since
they afford them the most natural environment and protection in
captivity. By nature shy, most softbills will hide in bush or shrub,
especially when they see strange persons or animals approaching.
Usually, therefore, an aviary is not as effective a means of showing
off birds as is a cage. Even those birds which ordinarily are so tame as
to take mealworms from their keeper's hand will, when sighting
strangers, go into hiding. Here I recall the enterprising birdman who
filled his spacious, partially planted aviaries with numerous softbills
only to discover that, as a rule, they would stay out of sight, so that
most of the time neither he nor members of his family, nor friends
could see and enjoy his colourful collection. For a time he vowed
" I'll cut out the shrubbery. I want to see my birds. I'll soon fix
things ! " However, he soon found that among members of a large
collection of softbills, such as he maintained for a time, frequent fights,

often resulting in serious injury to smaller or weaker birds, occur,
unless the birds have close at hand a ready avenue of escape, such as the
leafage of shrubs and trees planted in the aviary. When, more or less
frequently, this same hobbyist found valuable birds dead on the floors
of his aviaries, he became convinced of the birds 5 need for shelter, for
hiding places, which he then supplied promptly. Since most softbills
do not damage living plants, their aviaries may be thickly planted to
suit their needs for protection and also their keeper's needs for attrac-
tive landscaping. Except for the birds, assuredly nothing gives to an
aviary a more pleasing and a more natural setting than various living
plants, deciduous as well as evergreens. They lend it that indispensable
out-of-door atmosphere, which invites favourable attention from its
owner and often favourable comments from his friends and visitors.
In conclusion, my keeping of softbills has afforded me hours upon
hours of quiet relaxation. The work of caring for and feeding my birds
has been--and is--pleasant and not time-consuming. Now, with
between fifty and sixty softbills, largely in aviaries, the preparation of
the various foods as well as the actual feeding requires only an hour
or so--and a very pleasant hour it is, this fairly close association with
my feathered friends which, given reasonably good and regular care,
repay me handsomely in so many ways, not the least of which is their
fine singing. By some persons the hobby of keeping softbills is con-
sidered expensive, but I have not found it so. What if I pay, say, fifty
dollars for a Shama Thrush or a European Nightingale ! Assuming
that I can maintain such a bird in sound health for at least ten years,
the initial purchase price thus spread over the bird's life-span in my
aviaries is quite reasonable. The major drawback to this hobby, in my
opinion, is that it tends to keep its followers too much at home, for it
is usually difficult to find a reliable man or woman, or one sufficiently
interested, to care for one's softbills during a prolonged absence.
Moreover, one is usually reluctant to entrust one's precious birds into
the hands of a stranger for fear he or she might neglect them, since such
neglect, whether intended or not, can easily prove fatal with more or
less delicate birds accustomed to being given precise care.
All in all, I believe that softbills make remarkably interesting and
intelligent subjects for a stimulating hobby, owing largely to their
unique character. And they repay their keeper variously and gener-
ously for whatever attention and care he devotes to them day in and
day out the whole year through.

REPORT ON PROPAGATION OF HYBRID
SONNERAT'S JUNGLE FOWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99766835" page_id="56238405"  page_num="223" year="" vol="">
By David M. Johnson (Port Orchard, Washington State, U.S.A.)
Since my report of a year ago we have learned a considerable amount
by trial and error in propagating our birds.
We find that new blood is a most important factor in producing
chicks that are biologically proficient, with the will to hatch well and
with constitutions for good stamina or low mortality. The question
arises from time to time, why cross Grey Jungle Fowl with any fowl
of another species regardless of what breed of that species it may be ?
The answer to that is that Grey Jungles or sonnerati are limited in
number in this country and in need of new imported blood to re-
juvenate them. Sonnerati are not too prolific in the first place, laying from
four to seven eggs per clutch in a brief spring season, their autumn
bloom after eclipse being too late in a northern latitude when the sun
is rapidly leaving us, while hybrid birds and back crosses are so
prolific, producing an abundance of eggs comparable to poultry.
Birds produced from hybrid cocks and sonnerati hens, which we
may refer to here as f Sonnerat's, all have the general appearance of
pure sonnerati including the inherent wildness if not more wild.
We have learned that our best birds from all standpoints are those
obtained from cock f sonnerati J Bankaiva crossed on Cornish Indian
Game hens. These are the chicks so much in demand this season
which we call " Johnsoni " 2.
They come as much alike as peas in a pod in uniformity of shape
and colouring with all the qualities one would wish to obtain in a bird
lovely to behold.
It is birds of this type we are exporting now to southern States and
overseas, some 30 odd in number, which will be tried out in re-
habilitation projects, habitats believed suitable to it as birds potentially
for the coverts.
We believe there is much future for it as a wild bird as it retains
all the wild and sharp-witted instincts of sonnerati and its distaste for
captivity. Its powers and willingness for flight are all one could wish
for, comparable to pheasant in flight.
We find that Cornish, or any of the true games, are the best medium
for crossing as it makes a harmonious blend of no offshoots or muta-
tions, no erect tails or surplus combs and wattles indicating the stigma
of domestic degeneracy of most fowls.
It has been our hope that more aviculturists would experiment on
the establishing of their own birds from original crosses so that we could
exchange birds of different blood lines of no relation to one another

and who could introduce new Sonnerat's Grey Jungle Fowl blood to ;
their flocks from time to time as the need shows itself.
A strain almost identical to pure sonnerati could be established with
strong constitutions and a potential to abundance of egg production
and prolific aptitude. Our S cocks inherit the beautiful cape or hackle
with the waxy dots as in sonnerati except the spots are slightly narrower.
Our experience in the rearing of chicks is that they do not thrive
well in confinement and under artificial conditions. They are birds of
energy, lovers of freedom, work hard for a living and seem to derive
things from the earth essential to their welfare and good health.
Free range or semi-enclosure seems to be essential, and they are more
carnivorous and less granivorous than domestic fowl.
There has been no mortality from illness or disease in spite of our
cold overcast sky and altogether reluctant summer to date.
Our parent birds are already going into eclipse for the season

BAUDIN'S COCKATOO

Baudin's, or the White-tailed Black Cockatoo, originally described
and figured by Lear in 1832, is a native of forested areas of south-
western Australia.
Gould says of it : " Like other members of the genus, it frequents
the large forests of Eucalypti and the belts of Banksiae, upon the seeds
of which it mainly subsists ; occasionally it seeks its food on the
ground, when insects, fallen seeds, etc., are equally partaken of; the
larvae of moths and other insects are extracted by it from the trunks
and limbs of such trees as are infested by them."
Mathews ( Birds of Australia , vol. vi) quotes Tom Carter as having
observed that : " This is the common Cockatoo of south-west
Australia and is found as far north as the Murchison River. They
associate in flocks when the breeding season is over ... At times
a flock will settle in an orchard, and do great damage in a very short
time to the buds and young shoots of the trees . . . The breeding
season about Broome Hill seemed to commence in August and continue
until November. Two eggs appear to be the full clutch, and very
frequently one egg is not hatched . . . The fledged young birds are
fed by the parents for many weeks after leaving the nest ; thus on
10th February, 1914, I noted young birds being fed by adults . . ."
The nest is situated in a hollow tree, usually at a considerable
height from the ground. At what age breeding commences is, so far as
I am aware, not known.

BREEDING OF COMMON RHEA IN ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS, ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA.

By Vincent D. Haggard (Director)
In 1938 Adelaide Zoological Gardens acquired a solitary hen
Common Rhea (Rhea rothschildi ), and it was not until thirteen years
later that a mate was obtained for her. In the meantime she regularly
produced eggs which, incidentally, proved excellent for culinary
purposes such as omelettes and scrambled egg, these being not too
strong in flavour as might have been expected.
Late in 1951 it was arranged with Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney,
that we should have a male on loan for mating purposes. This bird
arrived by air on 22nd November, 1951, and the two were placed
together soon afterwards.
The first egg was laid on 5th December and others at irregular
intervals, eight having been laid by 13th January. In the meantime
three eggs had been broken by the birds and all were then removed
from the yard as they appeared and held until the male showed signs
of commencing incubation. In anticipation of this a nest had been
hollowed out in the ground underneath a tree and an egg placed
therein.
The male sat on this for a short time on 13th January and the other
remaining four eggs were then placed under him. Subsequent to this
the hen laid a further seven eggs, the male ultimately covering a
total clutch of twelve. It followed, therefore, that he had been sitting
a considerable time before the last egg was laid and that the first
chick would make its appearance long before the last eggs were
expected to hatch.
Incubation period is about forty days and the first chick appeared
on schedule on 21st February. There was something abnormal
about the arrival of this little stranger, as it was found early in the
day at a considerable distance from the nest, together with the remains
of the egg from which it emerged. This chick was placed in a box
and kept in warm sunlight until later in the day when an attempt was
made to place it under the brooding male. However, he gave it
several vicious pecks and it was therefore placed in a warm brooder
overnight. Next morning a second chick was found in circumstances

similar to the arrival of the first, and the two were placed in the
brooder out in the sunlight which was nice and mild at the time.
At this stage they were too young to be in need of food, but both
showed an interest in shell-grit and swallowed a few pieces. Instinct
was already prompting them to take in this necessary adjunct to
assist in digestion of food.
Late in the second day three more chicks had hatched and the
male was by then looking upon them with a more kindly eye ; the
opportunity was therefore taken to return to him the first two arrivals.
The score was now five. On the third day a sixth chick hatched and
the proud father came off the nest the following day, leaving six
unhatched eggs. This eventuality had been foreseen, owing to seven
eggs being laid some days after incubation had commenced, and an
incubator had been warmed up in advance in readiness to carry on
with the job. Two of the eggs were obviously no good, but the other
four were placed in the incubator although hopes were not high of
getting more chicks. However, much to our delight, about a week
later three more new arrivals appeared at odd intervals. These were
kept in the brooder for several days till they gained strength, then
being transferred to father's care. He accepted them readily enough
but there was a very noticeable disparity in their size compared with
their elder brethren, this difference persisting for several months
when it became more difficult to differentiate between them.
At no stage after the eggs were laid did the hen evince any interest
in the proceedings and, after the arrival of the chicks, it was deemed
advisable to remove her from the yard as her attentions were inclined
to be hostile rather than maternal. Early every evening and when the
weather was cool, father would sit down and fluff out his wings
and the chicks would snuggle underneath just as domestic poultry
chicks do. He proved a good parent and not one chick was lost.
When about four months old, five chicks were sent by air to Taronga
Park Zoo, one in exchange for " father " who was retained and
four as Taronga's share of the " dividend " resulting from the satis-
factory arrangement entered into earlier.

E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING THE CANARY-WINGED PARRAKEET 22 7
It might be thought that undue importance was attached to the
breeding of this species which has since proved very easy to rear.
It is pointed out, however, that Australian Zoological Gardens are
subject to very restrictive quarantine regulations, and several years
prior to the first breeding referred to, a complete ban was placed
on the importation of all birds from anywhere in the world except
New Zealand, where quarantine regulations are equally restrictive.
The reader will readily understand, therefore, the importance that
Australian Zoological Gardens place on the breeding of foreign birds
which, unfortunately, can no longer be imported. Unless we can breed
from the stock of exotic birds in our possession the species gradually
becomes extinct in our Zoological Gardens as individuals die out.
We hopefully look forward to the day when perhaps the severe
restrictions might be somewhat ameliorated, but in the meantime
must do the best we can in the circumstances. We envy Zoological
Gardens in other parts of the world which operate under much more
liberal quarantine regulations and which, with certain reservations,
can make a choice from the birds of the world.

BREEDING THE CANARY-WINGED PARRAKEET

By E. N. T. Vane (Ballinger, Bucks, England)
Records of the breeding of Brotogeris parrakeets are few, probably
because they are such delightfully finger-tame pets that the oppor-
tunity to reproduce is seldom given them. Peters lists three sub-
species of versicolurus , regarding the Canary-wing as only subspecifically
different from the Whitewing, yet the All-green he considers as a
different species. When the Parrot ban was raised recently a number of
Canary-wings came over and among the consignments it was not
unusual to find an occasional odd specimen of either of the above-
mentioned birds.
Some specimens appear to be considerably larger than others, but as
all the birds in each consignment are generally of the same size, this
feature is possibly only due to a local race variation. The distribution
is rather wide, ranging from Eastern Bolivia to Argentine, Eastern
Brazil, and Paraguay.
In setting out to breed them, the first obstacle is to sex them correctly.
There is no external sexual distinction ; South American parrakeets
are very difficult to sex by the pelvic bone test, as these are much more
close set and elongated than African or Australian birds, but when in
breeding condition there is a noticeable variation in the opening in the
sexes. This definitely disappears when breeding is over and it was quite
impossible to tell my breeding pair when they were eventually brought

in, although I knew perfectly well which was which as the male had a
slightly upturned toenail on one foot. They had been in my possession
over a year before all doubts on this point were removed. According
to some old writers the hen has a less deeply notched and narrower
bill and her head is rounder and smaller than the cock's. If anything,
my hen is larger than her mate, but they are practically indistinguish-
able. Her bill is less notched on one side than the other, in other
words it is impossible to sex them by sight.
For the first year they were kept in a cage indoors as they were
pinioned and unable to fly at all. They were absolutely fearless of
human beings and appeared fully conscious of their superiority. They
chattered incessantly and made a great noise when certain programmes
were on the radio or one attempted to speak on the telephone. When
they were fed they always came down to wait for the fresh food and
used to bite my fingers impatiently ; it would have been perfectly
easy to tame them to sit on one's finger, but I always hoped to breed
them so did not encourage them to become over-familiar.
During the winter of 1953-4 they moulted out and grew their flight
feathers, the cock being the first to do so. It now became possible to
distinguish their sex as the cock sometimes fed the hen and it was then
noted that he had one upturned toenail. At the end of April they were
moved to a small aviary facing south, 6 feet long, 6 feet high, and
3 feet wide, with half of the roof covered in and the whole of the back
protected on the north with asbestos sheet. There was no completely
enclosed shelter, but 2 feet from the rear a sheet of windowlite afforded
protection from wind and rain, and behind this screen their food was
supplied through a service door. A large, solid nest-box about 18
inches deep and 9 inches square, with 3 inches of peat mould in the
bottom, was fixed to the rear of the flight. To start with they did
not use the box for roosting, but were sensible enough to get right
at the rear high up under cover, which was just as well as mid-winter
returned early in May and they had to be brought in once more.
When roosting they like to hang upside down on the wires both in
cage and aviary. A second attempt was started on the 8th May,
and by the 21st they began to roost in the box, and a week later the
cock was feeding the hen regularly.
Their demeanour in the flight did not change, they were still
perfectly fearless and friendly though when they came nibbling at my
fingers the cock began to scold rather badly and sometimes bit rather
hard. It was plain that with the approach of breeding operations he
was going to be somewhat vicious and it would be unwise to associate
more than one pair in a flight at this time. They made much less
noise in the aviary, only chattering when they saw anyone coming
round to see them. They ignored some lovebirds in an adjoining
flight unless they hung on the wire, but as this was double and spaced

one inch apart no harm could result, though without this precaution
I fear there would have been many toes missing by the end of the
season.
On the ioth June they were seen mating. This was accomplished
standing side by side on the perch gripping their left and right feet
together as if they were " hand-in-hand The box being hung
outside the flight I was able to inspect it without their having any
idea that I was doing so. As soon as their food was supplied in the
morning they were so busy examining it and scolding me through the
service door that I could safely look in. The box was perfectly clean,
a certain amount of whittling had been done and a hollow made in
the peat mould in one corner. No materials were taken in.
The first egg was laid on nth June. There were two on the 13th,
and the hen began to spend more time in the box. On the 20th
she was off feeding and there were five eggs a little larger than a
Budgerigar's and more elongated. She had been almost continually
in the box since the 13th, and I assumed she had been sitting from the
second egg and they would probably hatch about 1st July, though
the eggs appeared so light in colour that I hardly expected them to be
fertile.
This fear mounted when I was next able to inspect the nest on
1 st July. Still five eggs and not very fertile-looking. The box was right
next to the feeding trap and the hen sat close every morning until
I had moved two or three flights away, when she immediately came
off and started feeding ravenously. I did not wish to disturb her
unnecessarily so did not go back and interfere.
On the nth July I looked once more and was very disappointed
to find still five eggs which did not look particularly " heavy
I decided in desperation to give them three more days. On the 14th,
when I went to remove them two looked as though they had some-
thing inside, so I left them and was most thankful the next morning
I had done so as three eggs had hatched on the 15th within the twenty-
four hours. On the 16th all five had hatched. The period of incuba-
tion is, therefore, a lengthy one of about twenty-six days at least.
The young were entirely naked, just like Budgerigars, which might,
therefore, be used as fosters if the long incubation period is allowed
for by moving the eggs. They were slow in developing, being com-
pletely naked until ten days old. On the 30th (fifteen days) the
feather tracts could be seen forming, there was no down, their eyes were
black and still unopened, the beaks were white--not black as I once
saw them described.
Their eyes were really open on 8th August (twenty-four days old) by
which time the feathers were opening and showing yellow and green.
By the 18th their bills were horn colour like the adults, and they were
looking extremely well--one had disappeared in the early days. All

the eggs had hatched, but they were never interfered with beyond
the unsuspected inspections from the back, all that one could see was a
tangled bunch of young birds and possibly the last to hatch did not
get its fair share and was lost.
The hen did all the incubating, the cock joining her at night in the
box when he may have assisted in these duties, but she only came off at
short regular intervals to feed and exercise. Both birds remained
perfectly fearless and literally finger tame, yet aggressive and a little
vicious, especially the cock, who was a model parent, spending the
whole day preparing the family meals ; he scarcely left the food bowl
which was filled twice daily. Enormous amounts of greenfood were
consumed.
The first young one to leave the nest made the effort on 3rd Septem-
ber, just eight weeks from the date of hatching. It was exactly like
its parents but a little smaller and the bill was obviously immature.
It stayed out all day, but as it was cold in the evening he was put back
into the nest at nightfall. Two came out on the 5th and again were
replaced at night. On the 6th all four fledged and made a very pleasant
sight on the perch together in a row with mother and father on the
outsides. One was rather less steady on the wing than the others. On
8th September they all stayed out as I neglected them by attending
the B.A.C. dinner, but the night was fine and they appeared none the
worse.
On the 9th it rained and rained, just like an English summer, and
I was very sad to find the youngest one lying on its back with its feet
in the air in a pool of water an inch deep. I picked him up and was
about to throw his body away when I discovered he still had a spark of
life left. I brought him in and held him in front of an electric fire
fully convinced that I was wasting my time, but in an astonishingly
short time he recovered and within two hours he was sitting on my
finger quite dry and preening himself. To cut a long story short,
he was hand-reared and was feeding himself in ten days. He was
given soaked bread rusks with a little oatmeal and peanut butter and
Virol. He also had a little apple, a daily dose of abidec, and in a
few weeks he had caught up his brothers, with whom he is now reunited
although he is much steadier than they.
The other young stayed out in the aviary until the end of October.
They did not go back into the nest to roost, but sat side by side on a
perch, the parents hanging from the wire overhead. On one occasion
the temperature dropped to 25 degrees before they were brought in.
Their food is mainly canary (mazagan), with a quarter part of
white millet, one-eighth part sunflower, a few oats, and a small ration
of hemp whilst being reared. They are very fond of fruit and had a
slice of apple or pear daily each, occasionally a piece of banana as

almost exclusively. They did not care for millet sprays much. Every
day they had moistened brown bread rusks and sprouted canary
seed. They consume a large quantity of greenfood, starting in the
early part of the season on dandelion leaves, then their seeding heads,
groundsel, chickweed, sow thistle, and later on all seeding weeds.
They delighted in chewing up a huge whole sow-thistle.
Given a true pair and the right accommodation, which is very
modest, I believe there is every hope that these delightful little birds
would establish themselves in our aviaries, but I do think that each
breeding pair requires separate quarters.

DARENTH-HULME, 1954
By Kay Bonner (Southgate, England)
The past breeding season has been very poor, in fact it is really
remarkable how few young ones have been reared. It is fortunate
therefore that, in spite of the atrocious weather, even including the
near arctic conditions early in the year, the mortality has, for a
comparatively large collection, been extraordinarily low.
It will perhaps be easiest to list the various aviaries and their inmates.
The main range has housed the following :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.916597380952381" page_id="56238416"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
1. Stanley Parrakeets, a well-tried breeding pair produced only one
good young one. Diamond Doves.
2. Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets laid, but did not hatch.
3. Stanley Parrakeets, and two cock Yellow-naped Whydahs.
4. Cockatiels produced one very undersized young one that died
soon after leaving the nest. Fischer's Lovebirds, a small
colony that just holds its own. One young one was hatched
and reared by a pair of Budgerigars. A cock Peach-faced
Lovebird.
5. Lineolated Parrakeets, the breeding colony has increased but to
what extent is not known exactly.
6. Pennant's Parrakeets, the pair that reared four good ones last
year, reared only two this season.
7. Abyssinian Lovebirds, the three pairs again failed to reproduce.
8. Golden-winged Parrakeets, the two pairs made no attempt to
nest, not even inspecting nest-boxes.
9. Moustache Parrakeets, most dreadfully noisy and definitely not
recommended to any aviculturist likely to suffer from neighbour
trouble.
10. Cactus Conures and a single Weddell's Conure. Painted Quail.
11. Two pairs of Yellow-cheeked Conures, both nested unsuccessfully :
</listItem>

another pair died during the arctic weather, feet badly frost-
bitten.
12. Two pairs of Canary-winged Parrakeets occupied this aviary
early in the season. This species has the reputation of being
very quarrelsome, and this was confirmed by the fact that one
of the quartet was severely maltreated and rescued only just
in time to save its life.

13. Golden-mantled Rosellas reared one only.
14. Black-headed Conures reared one good young one. Cock
Delamere's Whydah, a really handsome bird.
15. Barraband's Parrakeets, the cock went down with paralysed legs

early in the spring. As no attempts have been made to nest,
we are wondering whether it might perhaps have been our
breeding hen.
18. Eight Yellow-cheeked Conures at the beginning of the season ;
one has died since. No breeding attempts, nest-boxes not even
inspected.
The 7 ft. 6 in. wide flight stretching along the front of the main
aviaries was stocked this year with two dozen Budgerigars of assorted
colours ; and the breeding here has been very satisfactory indeed.
The 72 ft. flight has enabled the young to develop into really fine,
robust birds--very different to some of the control-bred, bird-room
birds seen nowadays. For want of other accommodation two Jobi
Island or White-breasted Ground Pigeons (Gallicolumba jobiensis)
were put in this flight. Fortunately they proved to be a pair, and
built a very slight nest, mainly of old millet sprays, precariously
constructed on the top of a Budgerigar nest-box hanging under shelter
in a corner of the flight. Not only did they hatch a young one, but
they succeeded in rearing it in spite of the Budgerigars. At one time
we were troubled by daily visits from a Sparrow-Hawk. On these
occasions the Budgerigars panicked, and it was not uncommon to find
a dozen or fifteen taking refuge with the pigeons on top of the nest-box.
This young one is probably the first reared since Herbert Bright's
first success when he reared two young ones in 1922.
The 10 ft. wide service passage and wilderness aviary at the rear
of the aviaries contains two pairs of Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons,
four Purple-headed Glossy Starlings, and a hen Amherst Pheasant.
The cock bird was allowed to escape and, as it stayed in the district
for a week or more, the daily papers were able to carry reports of a
mystery bird seen in North London, with the usual, totally incorrect
statement that " Zoo experts are puzzled " !
The large aviary containing the Red-faced Lovebird colony of
twenty-eight remains just a colony. There has been considerable
activity and much excavation, but as far as we know at present there
has not been a single egg. There are also Chinese Painted Quail and
breeding Diamond Doves.
The nine outside pens hold a miscellaneous assortment of Golden

and Silver Pheasants, domestic Pigeons, Bantams, Java and Barbary
Doves, Bronze-winged and Triangular-spotted Pigeons, and, most
important, three Pied Imperial Fruit Pigeons. The latter, commonly
known as Nutmeg Pigeons, are in perfect plumage, the white parts

being spotless, snowy white, so very different to the dull, cream-
coloured birds sometimes seen in zoos. There is also a very tame
Carrion Crow.
The White-bellied Caiques continue to occupy their own especial !
aviary. Although they pair frequently they never go further towards
nesting than to sit on top of their nest-box.
Bird-room No. i, at present houses a pair of Noble Macaws, three i
Canary-winged, one White-winged, one All-green, and eight
Lineolated Parrakeets ; one Rosella ; two Senegal Parrots ; two
pairs of Emerald-spotted and two pairs of Blue-spotted Wood Doves,
and three Peaceful Doves.
A second chalet-type bird-room has recently been completed, and
now has as tenants a pair of Blue-crowned Conures, a Black-headed i
Caique, and four Bleeding-heart Pigeons.
The house Parrots still consist of a pair of Greys, three Senegals,
a Brown-headed, and a Meyer's--originally believed to be Riippell's.
Finally, at the London Zoological Gardens, we have three Nicobar
Pigeons and five Green Imperial Fruit Pigeons which John Yealland is
kindly keeping for us until next spring.

By Alan Lendon (Adelaide, S. Australia)
This article records the results achieved in my collection from the
time of publication of my articles in the Avicultural Magazine
(Vols. 55 and 56, 1949-50), until my cessation of avicultural activities ;
after the 1952 breeding season.
Barraband's Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsonii ).--The three young in the
nest at the time of writing (November, 1948) were successfully reared,
leaving the nest early in December. The same pair of birds reared five
young in November, 1949, and the same number again in November,
1950. In 1951 the old cock died just as the clutch was hatching, but
the hen successfully reared all four young single-handed, and they were
perfect specimens when they left the nest in November.
For the 1952 season the same hen, one of my own breeding in 1946,
was mated to a young wild-caught cock. He proved to be possessed
of the nature of a Crimson-wing, and drove her mercilessly long before
she was ready to nest, but she eventually hatched four young and
reared three.
Rock Pebbler Parrakeet ( P. anthopeplus ).--The hen that successfully
reared six young in 1948, died in September, 1949, and her mate died
in September, 1950, just after a newly obtained hen had started

laying. This hen did not seem at all attractive to male Rock Pebblers,
as in 1951 she could not persuade either of two mates to feed her, and
she laid two eggs, but did not incubate.
In 1952, although a fourth male, who had been most attentive when
mated to a hen King, fed her occasionally, she laid three eggs, but again
did not incubate.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet (P. alexandrae ).--Three of the four
young previously referred to were satisfactorily reared in January,
1949. In the 1949 season four young were reared in November from
the first nest. Of the second clutch only one egg was fertile, but this
was hatched and reared. In 1950 four young were reared from the
first nest, but a second clutch was deserted. In 1951 three were
hatched, and two reared from the first clutch, and two hatched
and reared from a very large second clutch.
The old hen failed to moult satisfactorily before the 1952 season,
and her first clutch of five were all infertile ; she died after laying
four more eggs. A second pair kept that year laid a clutch of six late
in October ; four proved fertile, three hatched, and two left the nest
late in December, being very poor, undersized specimens.
King Parrakeet (Aprosmictus scapularis ).--In 1949 the old pair did
absolutely nothing, although the hen had raised my hopes by laying
from the perch the previous season. For the 1950 season I changed
the hen, but she got no further than visiting the log occasionally.
In 1951 I was fortunate to obtain the pair of birds that had bred
regularly for Mr. H. Bradley, but the hen did nothing beyond lay
two eggs on the ground in mid-November. In 1952, although I
obtained their original massive log, they did not even lay, and a
second pair did likewise.
Crimson-winged Parrakeet (A. erythropterus ).--A new pair obtained
in 1949 did nothing and began their moult in the first week of Decem-
ber. In 1950 this pair came into breeding condition in mid-September.
The first egg of a clutch of three was laid in mid-October ; all were
fertile and had hatched in the first week of November, and although
two died quite early, the survivor was reared and left the nest in the
middle of December.
In 1951 the same pair had a clutch of four eggs early in November,
and all had hatched by the end of the month ; of these, three were
reared, leaving the nest about the New Year. All three young, in
addition to their father, died within a month !
For the 1952 season the same hen was mated to a new adult cock,
and an egg was found on the ground in the middle of November ;
although this was placed in the log, three further eggs were not laid
until the end of the same month. Of these all three were hatched
and reared, the young birds leaving the nest towards the end of
January, 1953.

Pileated Parrakeet (.Purpureicephalus spurius ).--In 1949, a clutch of
seven was commenced on the last day of September, six were fertile,
five were hatched, and four reared, leaving the nest in early December.
In 1950, for some unexplained reason, no eggs were laid, but in
1951, although the first egg was laid from the perch in mid-October,
six more were suitably placed and all were fertile and had hatched by
mid-November. Of these five survived to leave the nest about
Christmas time, but the smallest only lived a few days.
In 1952 the clutch of six was not commenced until the end of
October, four out of six were hatched, and three left the nest late in
December.
Crimson Rosella (Platycercus elegans ).--This species was not repre-
sented in my collection in either 1949 or 1950, and a pair obtained
before the 1951 season did nothing, as did another pair in 1952.
Adelaide Rosella (P. adelaida ).--The pair that I had had for several
years laid a clutch of six in the middle of September, 1949 ; four of
these were fertile, but they were deserted when about due to hatch,
and disappeared a couple of days later. A second clutch of four was
laid early in November, and three dead young were found late that
month. In 1950 the same pair had four eggs by the end of Sep-
tember, but had broken them a few days later, and several more eggs
were subsequently laid and broken.
For the 1951 season I obtained a new hen, and she completed a
clutch of six eggs, all of which were fertile, by 25th October. Three
newly hatched young were observed on 17 th November, and four
days later there were three young living and one was dead ; the two
remaining eggs were given to a sitting pair of Western Rosellas, who
hatched them, but allowed them to die. The three young Adelaides
flourished and the first, a cock, left the nest on 20th December, and
the other two, a pair, two days later. This constituted my first
success with this species.
In 1952 the hen started to lay early in September, but the eggs
were broken almost as soon as they appeared. I thereupon removed
the log for a few weeks, and on replacing it, the next egg was laid
about the middle of October, and promptly broken ; five more
followed and were incubated, but only one was fertile, so two Golden-
mantled eggs were substituted for the clear ones. The young Adelaide
hatched first and the two Golden-mantleds about a week later ; the
Adelaide died nearly a month after hatching, and the smaller Golden-
mantled a week later, the other left the nest prematurely next day, and
was obviously being neglected, so was given to a pair of Pale-headed
Rosellas who were successful in rearing it.
Yellow Rosella (. P.jiaveolus ).--The pair which reared two clutches in
the previous season commenced a clutch of six eggs in the middle of
October, 1949. These were all fertile and young were seen early in

November, and four were later counted ; these were all reared and
left the nest between nth and 22nd of December.
In 1950 a clutch of six was started early in October, five were
fertile, and young were seen by the end of the month ; all of these
were reared, and left the nest early in December.
In 1951 the clutch of five was started a little later in October, and
all were hatched ; four were reared in early December, but one must
have injured a wing, as it was never able to fly. The following year
six fertile eggs were produced towards the end of October ; five were
hatched and left the nest from mid-December onwards.
Green Rosella (P. caledonicus ).--No results were obtained in either
1949 or 1950, but in 1951 the hen of the previous season was given a
new mate, and she laid the first egg of a clutch of six on 3rd November.
All proved fertile, and the first had hatched by 1st December, and
four could be counted two days later. One of these died quite early,
and two left the nest prematurely on 27th December, an extremely hot
day, and were replaced. The first young bird did not leave finally
until 8th January, and the other two followed two days later. All
were successfully reared ; they were a cock and two hens, and this
was my initial success with this infrequently bred species.
In 1952 the same pair laid a clutch of seven fertile eggs at exactly
the same time of the year, all hatched and five survived, leaving the
nest in mid-January.
Pale-headed Rosella ( P . adscitus ).--The pair which had reared two
young the previous year, started the 1949 season with an infertile
clutch, and only reared one out of three hatched in the second nest.
The following year the same hen, with a new mate, did not even lay.
In 1951 I acquired a new pair which had been regular breeders for
several years. They laid their first clutch of six late in August,
hatched the lot, and reared five of them. The second round of five
was laid in the middle of November, and were all reared by early
January. Carrying on in 1952, the same pair reared four out of five
hatched from their August clutch, and only one out of the two hatched
from the November clutch, in addition to the Golden-mantled
previously mentioned.
Northern Rosella (P. venustus ).--In 1949 the pair that had been
mated up the year before started with an infertile clutch in July, and
followed with four more eggs in September, all of which were hatched
and reared. This was the precursor of three remarkably successful
seasons, for in 1950 they reared five young from the first clutch
laid early in July, and five more from the end-of-September clutch.
1951 saw a very similar result, four being obtained from a clutch
laid late in June and four more from a mid-September laying. For
1952 the results were three from the early clutch and a further four

from the later one ; thus the total works out at twenty-nine hatched
and all reared from seven clutches in four seasons.
Eastern Rosella (P. eximius) .--In 1949 the hen that had been
successful in the previous year was mated to one of her sons. She
laid a clutch of five eggs towards the end of October and incubated
steadily, but all proved infertile. In August of the following year the
son, having fallen in love with a Golden-mantled hen in a near-by
aviary, proceeded to commit matricide, since when the common race
has not been kept.
Golden-mantled Rosella (P. splendidus) .--The cock which had bred
in 1948 was mated to one of his daughters the following season, and
although she laid three eggs in November, she did not incubate. In
1950 she was given an unrelated mate, and she started to lay early in
October. Although most of the early eggs were broken, I removed
eleven from the nest early in November ! Undeterred, she recom-
menced laying late in the month, and when I removed seven eggs
at the end of December I was amazed to find one contained a chick
on the point of hatching !
In 1951 the same pair had a clutch of six, laid late in September, of
which three were hatched and reared. In 1952 bad habits were again
in evidence, for many of the early eggs were broken, ten were removed
in November, and two of these were hatched by Adelaides and one
eventually reared with the help of the Pale-headeds.
Western Rosella (P. icterotis). --No results were obtained either in
1949 or 1950 from the pair which had laid and hatched young in
1948. A new hen was obtained for 1951, and although she laid a
clutch of five early in November, all the eggs were broken. She was
given a new mate for 1952 and laid a clutch of six in mid-October ;
three were fertile, but only one was hatched, and it promptly died.
Three more infertile eggs were laid in November, and another two
in December, which were not incubated. A second pair of immature
birds laid five eggs early in November of that year, but did not incubate.
Red-rumped Parrakeet ( Psephotus hamatonotus) .--This species was
not kept in either 1949 or 1950. A pair obtained in 1951 had an
infertile clutch of six early, then started non-stop laying early in
October, and had a clutch of four in December, three of which were
found to be fertile when deserted. In 1952 a different pair did nothing.
Many-coloured Parrakeet (Ps. vanus) .--Not kept in 1949 or in 1950.
In 1951 a wild-caught hen mated to an aviary-bred cock did nothing,
and a different pair obtained in 1952 were no improvement.
Red-vented Blue Bonnet Parrakeet (Ps. hcematorrhous) .--The old
male did nothing with either of the mates provided in 1949 and 1950.
A pair of young birds bred in my collection during the war were
bought back, but they did nothing in either 1950 or in 1951, and both
died in May, 1952.

Yellow-vented Blue Bonnet Parrakeet (Ps. xanthorrhous) .--The old
breeding cock was given a tame hand-reared hen as a mate in 1949,
and she laid a clutch of six towards the end of August. Five were
fertile and three were hatched and reared, leaving the nest at the end
of October. In 1950 the same pair hatched three and reared two at
the same time of the year, and in 1951 four were hatched and reared,
again at exactly the same time. In 1952 the old cock failed to induce
a new mate to lay, even though she spent some time in the log in
November.
Little Blue Bonnet Parrakeet ( Ps . naretha). --The old breeding hen,
with a new mate, had five clear eggs early in September, 1949. In
1950 the same pair had six eggs late in September ; only one was
fertile, but it was hatched and reared. In 1951 three were fertile out
of four laid early in September, and two hatched and were reared.
In 1952 a new hen was obtained, but she did not lay, although the
cock seemed more vigorous than in previous seasons.
Hooded Parrakeet ( Psephotellus dissimilis ).--No results were obtained,
although three different pairs were tried during the four years.
Bourke Grass Parrakeet (Neophema bourki). --In 1950 the first pair
was the old cock with a new mate. They hatched and reared four in
the first clutch, but only reared three out of five hatched in the second
try. A second pair reared only three out of six hatched in their first
attempt, then laid eleven eggs without incubating, and finally only
reared two of six hatched at the third try. In 1951 the first pair
only brought off two out of five hatched the first time, but reared
all four that hatched in the second attempt. The second pair laid
ten eggs, of which I left them seven, all of which they hatched and
five of which they reared. The hen then laid a further ten eggs, of
which I left her six, all of which hatched, but only three survived.
In 1952 the results were not as good. The first pair started by
hatching five and letting them all die, and followed with two hatched
and reared. The other pair also let die all five that they hatched in
the first nest, but reared four from eight hatched at the second attempt.
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (jV. chrysostoma). --In 1950 the hen of
the pair that had hatched young in the previous season broke a wing
and did not lay. The other hen ran true to form, and again laid a
number of eggs without incubating. In 1951 the profuse egg-layer
was mated to the by then bereaved husband of the broken-winged
hen ; her first clutch of seven were laid in October, which is unusually
early for this species, but all proved clear. Five out of a second lot
of seven were fertile, only three hatched, and all died quite soon.
The other cock of the previous year was given a new mate, and she had
four hatched from five fertile eggs, but only succeeded in rearing two
of them in mid-January. In 1952 this pair hatched all of four fertile
eggs laid early in November, and had reared three by mid-December.

Elegant Grass Parrakeet (JV. elegans ).--The old breeding pair raised
three out of three and one out of four hatched in 1950. In 1951 the
first clutch was clear, only one was fertile in the second, and it was
reared, and four Bourke eggs were substituted for an infertile third
clutch, and two of four hatched were reared. For 1952 a new cock
was obtained, and though the first clutch was again clear, two were
reared from three hatched in a second try.
Rock Grass Parrakeet (JV. petrophila ).--In 1950 the old hen had a
new mate, and she laid three eggs in October, hatched two of them,
but allowed them to die when a fortnight old. The same pair had
two clear eggs in 1951, and a new pair in 1952 did not lay, although
the hen was in the log a great deal.
Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet (JV. chrysogastra ).--In 1950 the hen
became interested in the log early in December, and laid her first egg on
the 30th of that month. The clutch consisted of four, which she incu-
bated steadily, but unfortunately all were clear. Early in 1951 Sir
Edward Hallstrom was kind enough to let me have a new cock to
replace the old one, known to have been in captivity since 1938 ! This
year the hen was seen in the nest, and feeding was observed late in
December. On 4th January the cock was dead, and three days later the
hen laid an egg ! However, she did not incubate, but produced another
egg early in February. Early in 1952 I was lucky enough to obtain yet
another cock, the best specimen that I have ever possessed, but
unfortunately the hen died in September. The only pair that I know
of in captivity nowadays is at the Adelaide Zoo, and though the hen
lays and incubates most years the eggs have always been clear.
Turquoise Grass Parrakeet (JV. pulchella ).--In 1950 one pair did not
lay ; the other pair did not sit on the first clutch, and reared the
only one hatched in the second. The following year this latter pair
again did not sit on the first clutch, the second were all clear, and the
third again were not incubated. A new hen provided for the cock
of the other pair had an infertile first clutch, and reared only one of
the three hatched in the second. In 1952 a single pair laid eleven
eggs late in the season, but did not sit.
Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeet (JV. splendida ).--Recent results with
this usually easy species were appalling. In 1950 a very fine cock
had two eggs laid by his first mate, and they promptly vanished ; he
was then given another hen who hatched three and four in successive
clutches, but reared none of them. Another cock had an early clutch
of seven from this hen, and when mated with the other did no more.
In 1951 both hens broke their eggs, and one ultimately died egg-
bound, and in 1952 one pair did not lay while the hen of a second
pair also died egg-bound, and a new hen then hatched two young
and they promptly died.

By J. Ye ALL AND
A very attractive little collection of birds, a present from Sq./Ldr.
K. C. Searle, was brought back from Singapore by Head Keeper
Akhurst of the Aquarium.
It consisted of a Blue-rumped Parrot ( Psittinus cyanurus ), a Long-
tailed Parrakeet (Psittacula longicauda ), the most beautiful of the
genus ; six Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeets ( Loriculus galgulus),
and two Malayan Yellow-breasted Sunbirds ( Leptocoma jugularis
microleuca) , new to the collection.
Other presentations include a Gannet (Sula bassana ), a Yellow-
casque Hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), and two Red-eared Bulbuls
[0 to comps a emeria).
Two Abyssinian Ground Hornbills ( Bucorvus abyssinicus ), two of the
handsome Goliath Herons ( Ardea goliath ), and two Black Pies or
Piapiacs ( Ptilostomus afer) have been purchased. It used to be thought
that red-billed specimens of this Pie were females, but it is now known
that only immature birds have red bills. On arrival from the Gambia
it was found that one of the Ground Hornbills had some of the common
African ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineus , on its head.
Twelve young Budgerigars of the Woburn homing strain have been
sent from Whipsnade and a few young ones have left the nests in the
new aviary. Two more Crested Pigeons have been bred ; also a
Bronze-wing, five Quaker Parrakeets, three Masked Lovebirds (blue-
bred green), a Rosy-faced Lovebird, two Lesser Black-backed Gulls,
a Herring Gull, and two Night Herons.

Peter Scott gave a brief review of some vanishing birds, California
Condor, Whooping Crane, Hawaiian Goose, etc. He suggested the
Society might use its influence in any attempt to persuade the con-
servation societies concerned to allow responsible breeders oppor-
tunities for increasing the numbers by breeding in captivity. D. M.
Reid-Henry and Frank Grant took part in the discussion that followed.

Bananas as a Food for Birds
In the tropics the banana is the chief food given to many caged fruit-eaters. Some
of the smaller sorts thrive solely on banana. There are many very fine and also many
inferior varieties of this fruit. The latter are very indigestible even when fully ripened.
The finer sorts do not last long enough to reach our shores, as the period of edibility
lasts for but a day or two. It is these sorts on which tropical birds thrive best. Even
the larger parrots will not thrive on inferior kinds yet I have known of a Macaw
to thrive on sound banana as its chief food.

The banana of commerce is of a more lasting nature than some of the fancy kinds,
keeping as it does for several days in an edible state. Nevertheless not until it is
thoroughly ripe is it safe for many birds. Under-ripe it causes colic, frequently
followed by deaths. Over-ripe it causes looseness, being then of no value.
Greenish-yellow bananas, whether with or without dark patches on the skin
are unwholesome food for the smaller birds, and for that matter the larger parrots.
A good test is that the skin peels off easily, neither breaking nor leaving any of it
adhering to the fruit. Should any skin adhere to the fruit it should not be fed, as it
is still undigestible in such a state. A thoroughly ripened banana has a golden yellow
skin covered sparsely with light brown spots.

THE USE OF NECTAR IN FEEDING BIRDS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.989612966666667" page_id="56238428"  page_num="244" year="" vol="">
I was very intrigued by the article and illustration of the Golden-fronted Wood-
pecker partaking of nectar food by J. Carpentier of the Antwerp Zoo.
Whilst I have not had experience of this particular species, the fact that it is
a fruit-eating bird explains why it has taken the nectar, mainly, I think, because the
sweetness compares with fruit juices. Old-standing members of the Avicultural
Society and foreign bird enthusiasts will know me in the trade as specializing, over
the last thirty-five years or so in Tanagers, Manakins, Fruitsuckers, and all the
nectar-eating species, and will know that I have always advised feeding fruit-eating
birds with sponge-cake or brown bread moistened with nectar, in addition to fruit.
I have always fed so and I am certain that it must have saved me many thousands of
pounds in preventing losses in fresh consignments.
Tanagers and Sugar Birds are generally packed with banana, which I consider
a bad food. I find that fresh arrivals after taking the sponge-cake or bread, which
they do straight away, will seldom touch banana again and my sole method for these
birds is to give only orange in the way of fruit and for the Sugar Birds a jar of nectar.
I have never tried Tanagers with nectar itself, but no doubt they would drink it ;
I like the cake and bread for roughage. I have, however, on occasions given pots of
nectar to the larger birds arriving in very poor condition. I recently received some
Greater Himalayan Barbets in very poor condition and in addition to the food
mentioned above I gave a 2 oz. jar of nectar to each bird. They consumed two jars
each day, and in a week, unless seen, one would never believe the difference in the
condition. At the moment I have a female Cock-of-the-Rock which drinks about 2 oz.
each day and a Red-crested Manakin which takes a similar amount.
I give nectar to all my stock, for finches and softbills I add it to the drinking
water ; my food, however, differs from that used by Mr. Carpentier. Many years
ago I cut out honey, condensed milk, and prepared invalid foods as they all turn sour
overnight ; I use only Dextrine-Maltose ingredients which even in hot weather will
not turn sour in 24 hours. My birds, from Humming Birds to Cock-of-the-Rock,
do excellently on it. I trust these few notes will be of interest to our members.

In his article (Sept.-Oct., 1954, issue) on " Woodpeckers in Captivity ", Mr. J.
Carpentier seeks information on the use of nectar for birds other than those for which
this preparation is normally provided.
This is a very intriguing subject, because when feeding Sugar Birds on this diet
I always have on hand each day a surplus which is placed before my Superb Tanager,
Golden-fronted Fruitsucker, and Black-headed Sibia. As these three birds proved
extremely partial to this liquid food I gave a little to my Scarlet Tanager who likewise
displayed a marked liking for it.

As a result of these experiments, which I carried out some time ago and from which
the above-mentioned birds derived much benefit, I decided to put about half a
teacupful in the main aviary to discover whether any other birds in my very mixed
collection would be attracted by it. Imagine my surprise and delight when I found
that not only did my Blue-throated Barbet and Indian Mynah regard it as a special
treat but that they had to reckon with competition from Bulbuls, Pekin Robins,
Ground Thrushes, Dyal Birds, and many kinds of seed-eating Finches. My pair of
tiny Grey Singers, for example, drank it eagerly as did also Orange-cheeked Waxbills,
Zebra Finches, and Tri-coloured Mannikins.
I have little doubt that, especially as a final evening feed in cold weather, nectar
is a valuable supplementary diet for many birds for which it has, perhaps, been
considered unsuitable. It is, I am sure, a very nourishing medium for any bird that
can be induced to take it.
There are, we all know, many varieties of nectar preparations based on the general
principle of honey, Swiss milk, and baby food. In respect of choice of components
I have found that much depends upon the individual bird. One Blue Honey Creeper
I have will not touch his mixture if a meat extract has been added. Nor have
I found it desirable, except about once a week, to make use of any of the infant
foods. I have a notion that too frequent use of them tends to produce fatness, particu-
larly when birds (as not infrequently happens) are confined in cages where exercise
is necessarily somewhat limited.
The whole question of bird nutrition, it seems to me, is one that should be studied
very carefully, not merely in relation to species, but specifically (and this is of cardinal

I was interested to read Monsieur Carpentier's article on the Golden-fronted
Woodpecker living in the Antwerp Zoo.
I recently bought a Cuban Black-browed Woodpecker (Melanerpes superciliaris)
and I find that it, too, is fond of the liquid Sunbird food. It also eats grapes, apple,
and occasionally a little minced raw beef, but will not touch insectile mixture or
mealworms, though these are offered daily. So far the bird is thriving ; it is very
active and calls a good deal, but it never pecks at the tree trunk in its aviary. Unlike
the Antwerp bird, my Woodpecker is very aggressive towards other birds and an
unfortunate White-eye that got into the aviary was quickly killed.
I have not been able to discover anything about the natural food of the Black-
browed Woodpecker, but Gosse, writing about the Radiolated Woodpecker of
Jamaica, says that it eats various fruits as well as wood-boring larvae and ants. It
also damages the stalks of sugar cane and sucks out the juice, so I wonder whether
any of the Cuban birds have similar tastes.

<reference confidence="0.621638833333333">
Like Monsieur Carpentier, I have found that other birds will also drink the Sun-
bird food and I believe it is good for them, especially the newly-imported small
birds.

These two birds which were owned by Mr. Rouwenhorst, of the Kroonstad district,
nested in a very ordinary box approximately 10 inches square and some 22 inches

These three chicks left the nest about four weeks ago (18th May, 1954). In all
appearances they are very healthy birds and the characteristics of both parents
can be seen. So far it is difficult to do any sexing as they are so very much alike but
there appears to be two and one. The one carrying more yellow colouring about the
head. However, all show yellow feathering amongst the head which, like the Black-
headed Conure, is all black. Wings similar to the same--black beaks and black feet,
all show yellowing on breast and abdomen.
The three chicks were acquired by me on 15th May, 1954, and the parents by
Mr. Rough. The three chicks are now fully feathered and independent of their
parents.

Whilst judging at a bird show at Southall in October of this year I was surprised to
find among the exhibits two Oxpeckers or Tick Birds (Buphagus africanus africanus).
If my memory is correct this is the first occasion that they have been exhibited alive
here* and I do not recollect having ever seen them represented at the London Zoological
Gardens. They were quiet when examined and in good health and plumage. Sitting
partly upright on their perch they peered at one curiously. Their strong feet which
enables them to clamber about the hides of herbivorous animals seemed fitted more
for this purpose than perching, although they perch on trees and on native cattle-
sheds. They were entered as " Blood Birds ", not altogether an unsuitable name.
Ornithologists at one time differed as to what they actually ate. It seems, however,
that not only are ticks eaten in quantity but stomach oxaminations include diptera,
lice blood, tissue, and hair. Animals in bad condition with open saddle and gall
wounds have such afflicted parts kept open by the birds pecking at flesh and sipping
the blood. Much information on the habits of these curious birds has been contributed
by Mr. Moreau and Major Cheeseman and others and requoted.
