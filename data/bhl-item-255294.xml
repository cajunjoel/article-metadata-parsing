OBSERVATIONS ON OLD WORLD PAINTED SNIPE,
ROSTRATULA BENGHALENSIS AT THE TARONGA ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99082971875" page_id="56470727"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Kerry A. Muller (Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
The family Rostratulidae in the Order Charadriiformes is repre-
sented by two monotypic genera. One species, Nycticryphes semicol-
laris, the South American Painted Snipe ranges irregularly in the
lowlands of Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. It
averages approximately 8.5 in. in length, the female being slightly
larger. (1)
The second species, Rostratula benghalensis, the Old World Painted
Snipe, ranges from Africa, south of the Sahara, to Cape Province,
Egypt, Madagascar, southern Asia from Asia Minor through Persia to
southern and eastern China, and Japan, south to Arabia, Sind, all of
India, Ceylon, Malay Peninsula, and Cambodia, Philippines, Borneo,
Sumatra and Java, Australia and Tasmania. (2) This species may be
up to 10 in. in length, the female also being larger and brighter.* 3 )
The species' life history is little known. They are primarily crepus-
cular and nocturnal birds inhabiting muddy grasslands and marshes,
and are unobtrusive skulkers during the day, aided in concealment by
their disruptive coloration. They are said to be rather solitary, and are
usually rare in most areas within their range. For these reasons few, if
any, ornithologists have had the opportunity to study their ethology in
any detail.
A great deal can of course be learned of any species when it is kept
in confinement under the proper conditions. However, a search of a
wide range of publications has disclosed only one reference to a Painted
Snipe having previously been kept in captivity. In Baker* 4 ) there is
reference to a work called " Indian Waders " by Finn in which Painted
Snipe were kept for a period in captivity and their defence display is
briefly described. Finn also mentions that Painted Snipe were kept in
the Calcutta Zoo : however this was not elaborated upon.
The Old World Painted Snipe is represented in Australia by the
subspecies R. b. australis * 5) . It is rare and seldom seen throughout its
range. Late in 1972 and early in 1973, following a period of heavy

rains, I received reports of a few Painted Snipe in a series of marshes
near Windsor, approximately fifty miles from Sydney. On March 3,
in conjunction with several local bird-banders, a collecting and banding
expedition was organized to one of these marshes at McGraws Hill,
located adjacent to a sewage treatment works. The marsh area extends
over several acres and consists of very soft mud, from one and a half
to four feet in depth, with grass tussocks growing on the surface. The
water source is sewer effluent from the adjacent treatment plant; need-
less to say the smell was formidable and the mosquitoes even more so.
Mist nets were extended in a line for several hundred feet across the
marsh at dusk. When it was completely dark three men extended in a
line and walked (or perhaps more accurately, struggled) methodically
back and forth across the area--a very tedious process, as the mud
often extended almost to the top of the thigh. As a result, in addition
to netting several Japanese Snipe (Gallinago hardwickii) which were
banded and released, we were fortunate in securing two Painted Snipe.
These proved to be a pair, and were brought to Taronga Zoo.
Upon arrival the pair was housed in an outdoor aviary, roughly
circular in shape, measuring approximately fifteen feet in diameter and
rising to seven feet in height. One side incorporated an open-fronted
concrete shelter approximately six feet wide, four feet front to back
and six feet high. The floor of the aviary was natural soil covered
with a substantial layer of sand. Included was an irregularly shaped
pool approximately four feet in diameter sloping to six inches in depth.
The aviary was heavily planted with a semi-aquatic reed, tentatively
identified as Lepironia articulata , whilst a smaller unidentified aquatic
reed species covered up to fifty per cent of the pond area.
The shelter contained only sand, rising in one area to two feet in a
sand dune effect. The only other occupants of the aviary were a
nesting pair of White-winged Wrens, Malurus leuconotus.
Lacking previous experience with this species, a wide range of food
items was initially offered. Earthworms mixed with earth were placed
in shallow pans and these pans were then recessed to ground level, as
the birds showed an initial mistrust of shining metal pans. Mealworms
were also offered, as was our standard shorebird mixture of raw meat
mixed with biscuit-meal, turkey startina, hard-boiled egg yolk and fly
pupae. In addition a pan of food for the wrens also was available,
containing golden pound cake, grated cheese and fly pupae. Termites
are also fed to the wrens.
Adapting Painted Snipe to captive diets was a cause for some initial
concern, as previous experience with Japanese Snipe proved them to
be difficult subjects. Our trepidations for the Painted Snipe proved
groundless, however, for as soon as they became accustomed to the
aviary they began eating, first the earthworms, then the shorebird diet
and soon astonished us by devouring the wrens' food !

<bodyText confidence="0.996521791666667" page_id="56470729"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
Because Painted Snipe are crepuscular and nocturnal, most of their
feeding and other activities were conducted at dawn, dusk and at night.
Later they began to feed during the day-time after the food was
delivered. We fully expected them to hide during the day under the
abundant reeds in the enclosure; however, they prefer to spend the day
in the rear of the shelter, where they are relatively easily observed.
Ethologically these birds are highly interesting. When alarmed the
larger female growled loudly, much like a large dog, or hissed like a
snake. This could be most disconcerting to anyone unfamiliar with the
species. Perhaps the most outstanding behaviour trait of the Painted
Snipe is their defence display (also described as a threat display and
courtship display). (5) (see illustration) When facing an adversary and
unable to fly away, both wings and tail are fully extended, displaying
their striking butterfly colour pattern. When moving sideways, only
the furthest wing is extended, the nearer wing being folded or partially
extended toward the ground. In appearance and behaviour they are
remarkably like a miniature Sun Bittern, Eurypyga helias.
Despite the fact that Painted Snipe are described as being largely
solitary our two birds are always seen together. They have proved to
be considerably more adaptive and intelligent under captive conditions
than I had anticipated.
I believe that much will be learned of the ethology of this species
by observing their behaviour under captive conditions, and they are
certainly an interesting exhibit in a zoo.

The term " sparrowy " in bird literature is invariably used to suggest
that the bird referred to resembles a female House Sparrow (Passer
domesticus). It is a kind of shorthand to avoid a detailed description
which, if it were to be really accurate would take up a lot of space. It
is unfortunate that the term has become synonymous with " dull,
drab ", and by implication, " uninteresting Whether sparrows in
general are dull and drab is a matter of opinion, but I feel that they
are all undeniably interesting. However, to many bird keepers, the sin
of lacking pretty colours can only be mitigated by a lovely song and in
this the sparrows also score badly. History is also against them; witness
the way Butler dismissed the Tree Sparrow (P. montanus) as being
". . . of little interest as an aviary bird, perhaps a trifle better than the

Few writers can be bothered to consider any of the European
sparrows at all other than to dismiss them as being " dull, drab and
uninteresting ". The facts appear to be different and one should not
consider a town-living House Sparrow as representative of its species.
A clean male in Spring plumage is undeniably richly coloured, as is a
Spring Tree Sparrow. The less well-known Spanish Sparrow (P.
hispaniolensis) is much more striking for its whites are whiter and the
orange and chestnut streakings on the mantle are really lovely. In
fresh autumn plumage the new feathers are edged with greyish buff,
which gives a dulling effect, and the birds are noticeably less colourful,
but as these edgings disintegrate or wear off so the clearer colours
become displayed. I have not kept the Italian Sparrow (P. italiae)
but as an intermediate between the House and Spanish it can hardly
be drab.
I have kept many sparrows, both European and African, but (and
I include the Petronia and Auripasser in this) I have found the Euro-
pean Passer sparrows to be quite distinct. They differ from the others
in their behaviour and attitudes towards man, wild-caught birds rarely
settling down, and always behaving like newly-caught birds whenever
one enters the bird room--dashing about recklessly. I agree whole-
heartedly with Steinbacher who says that hand-reared sparrows make
delightful pets but need comparatively large cages to feel secure and
happy.
Back in England a summer hardly ever went by without me hand-
rearing one or more House Sparrows. Each year I varied my tech-
nique, more out of a desire to experiment and learn than from
consideration for the birds I must admit. I used to take the bird of
the moment to the office with me on the train, commuting to London,

and would feed it whenever time allowed. One year a nestling was
brought to me that could not have been more than 7 or 8 days old.
It was found in the centre of a very busy crossroads. This bird was
raised mainly on maggots, a few mealworms, and an increasing amount
of human food--like cheese and ham sandwiches! The young bird
quickly began pecking at hard seed and within a couple of weeks I was
leaving it for the day in the large mixed aviary to be hand-fed morn-
ings and evenings only. It became as wild as any real wild bird almost
as quickly as it was weaned. In a 17-foot flight it would hurl itself
from end to end in its effort to escape from me, its welcome benefactor
of only a few weeks before. I soon released it as it disturbed the other
birds so much. Every story is different, but of all of the House and
Tree Sparrows that I have hand-reared, each has ended the same way.
I do believe that hand-reared sparrows can be really delightful pets,
but these are invariably those imprinted onto humans. I have always
tried to integrate my sparrows into bird society as much as possible,
and the result has been inevitable.
Summers-Smith said that the House Sparrow was probably unique
in the way that it lived so much in association with man, yet distrusted
him so profoundly. One can always be put to flight by simply being
watched; however absorbed a House Sparrow may be, or secure (as on
a guttering pipe), the moment it notices the human watcher its
demeanour changes, and it flees. Derek Washington overcame this
problem by watching the behaviour of his sparrows from a distance
of 80 feet with the aid of binoculars. I have found the " wary "
characteristics exactly repeated in the Spanish Sparrow both in the
wild in the Canary Islands, where it occupies the usual House Sparrow
niche, and in captivity. The few adult Tree Sparrows that I have
kept have been the same. Bennett found the Tree Sparrow to be
" restless and most difficult to steady, the only really tame specimens
. . . having been hand reared ".
This characteristic does not endear these birds to the aviculturist,
who earnestly seeks some evidence of a rapport with his charges. How-
ever, not all aviculturists have found these sparrows to be intractable
and difficult. Arthur Douglas mentioned in a recent letter to me that
he had had some sparrows that remained fairly steady, although most
became or remained very wild. Frank Meaden told me that an aviary
strain of fawn House Sparrows had been passed on to ASPEBA not
so long ago, so obviously somebody found a way to cope successfully
with them. Colin Harrison mentioned (pers. comm.) that A. H. Scott
had bred the House Sparrow, and Derek Washington subsequently
contributed a most interesting article to the Avicultural Magazine
on his success with this species. Clearly, while P. domesticus is not a
species suitable for cage life it can adapt sufficiently to life in an aviary
to perform all the functions necessary to survive as a species.

As Mr. Washington pointed out, records of breedings in captivity
are sparse to say the least. Without his detailed and interesting notes
one would in fact be left without any first hand account. Even
Summers-Smith, in his 260 pages, only refers obliquely to captive
breedings.
Some of the aspects of breeding behaviour are what might be
expected. Thus the sexual development in the male occurs as a
response to external stimuli, in particular in temperate climates to
changing day length (Summers-Smith). However the sexual develop-
ment in the female occurs later than in the male, but for the female
to reach ovulation she must be exposed to the stimuli of a displaying
male, plus a nest and nesting material. The communal display of the
sparrow is an integral part of this display factor (Polikarpova). Wash-
ington mentions that a male was often excited by the presence of wild
females outside the aviary which suggests that the community aspect
should not be overlooked.
My own interest in European Sparrows did not rise above the hand-
rearing-then-releasing stage until I came to Spain. There is a thriving
bird market in Madrid every Sunday morning and I have been visiting
it every few weeks for about four years now. Of course the species
that I always look out for are never there, but my hope never
diminishes. One can often see Tree Sparrows, not many, but some-
times one, two or three, in a trappers travelling cage full of Gold-
finches or Linnets. The behaviour of these Tree Sparrows is very
interesting. They invariably hold themselves in a low crouching posi-
tion, and will bury themselves beneath any other bird, especially in a
corner. This characteristic I have only seen in newly caught or badly
frightened Pied Flycatchers. The difference is that once steadied down
and used to its environment the Pied Flycatcher will not do this,
whereas the Tree Sparrow always will. The wild adult Tree Sparrows
proved to be so panic stricken that I soon stopped buying them unless
I was to release them the same day. I found that the hand-reared
Tree Sparrows that I bought went the same way as the House
Sparrows.
One day I saw a single adult male Spanish Sparrow that had been
caught locally (by clap net at a water hole) in the company of Linnets,
etc. The vendor regarded it with amusement as a curiosity, and I
bought the bird. The extent of black on the bib is much less than one
might be led to believe by looking at the field guides. To make the
point clear I have made a comparative sketch of a typical male
Spanish Sparrow and the male shown in the Hamlyn guide, using
Arthur Singer's sketch as the base. Out of the collection of a large
number of skins in the museum at Seville, only one male has the
amount of black indicated in the Singer bird.

A male Spanish Sparrow, Passer hispaniolensis, [left] in the author's collection
for comparison with a field guide illustration [right].
I had by this time become very interested in the Italian Sparrow. Is
it a race of P. domesticus or a separate species? Following the disci-
pline of the Geographical Species Concept then all three birds must be
races of the one species, Passer domesticus domesticus , P. d. hispanio-
lensis , and P. d. italiae. If on the other hand P. domesticus and P.
hispaniolensis are true species why is the population in Algeria known
as P. domesticus x P. hispaniolensis and the Italian population known
as P. d. italiae. If italiae is a synonym for domesticus x hispaniolensis
then the so called hybrid zone across northern Italy must be described
as domesticus x (domesticus x hispaniolensis), and it becomes obvious
that the whole affair is a muddle.
Acting in the belief that aviculture can aid science I arranged with
my friend Herbert Murray that he would run this Spaniard in with a
domesticus female that he had, with the hope that we would produce
Italian Sparrows. The result of this ambition can be read in Mr.
Murray's interesting notes elsewhere is this issue.
Shortly after delivering the lone Spanish male to England, I was
delighted to be able to go to the Canary Islands on a business trip. To
the mystification of my Spanish colleagues I neither swam, nor siesta-
ed, but travelled all over Palma and Tenerife trying to find " bird-
men ". My efforts eventually bore fruit and part of the small collection
that I acquired was a pair of Spanish Sparrows. The species is an
introduction on the islands, but I do not believe that their subsequent
isolation has brought about any island race characteristics yet. All the
books had said that the females of hispaniolensis are indistinguishable
from those of domesticus. On the assumption that this was correct I
concluded that I had an adult and an immature male, for the female
has a white spot behind the eye, is very cleanly marked on the mantle

and wings, and shows a tendency towards black streakings on the side
of the breast. I kept these birds in my bird room for a couple of months
and regret that I never found time to paint them. There is no doubt
in my mind however that this particular bird at any rate was definitely
not a female House Sparrow.
On the next business trip to England in April of this year I took
these birds with me and handed them over to ASPEBA for breeding
purposes and study in relation to the domesticus / italiae / hispaniolensis
matter. Colin Harrison had hoped to be able to breed them but I
gather that some Saffron Finches breeding in the same aviary were
sufficiently dominant as to prevent the sparrows from settling down.
They were passed to Mr. Murray who fortunately succeeded with
them.
With a species as opportunistic a feeder as the House Sparrow (and
the Spanish Sparrow must be considered to be virtually equal) it may
be of interest to consider their diet preferences. Kalmbach did some
detailed studies of this and reached the following data (expressed as

I very much regret that I did not conduct any controlled feeding
experiments. All my sparrows this year have been given a mixture of
one part standard canary mixture, one part white millet, one part
hemp, corn and wheat. They very quickly recognised the mealworm
procedure--not that I give very many to the seedeaters--and were
invariably the first to the bowl beating larks and buntings alike. A
newly fledged Tree Sparrow was always first. Some soft food is given
each day to these birds; it is a standard universal mixture to which I
add ox heart, cheese, grated carrot and a good lashing of Squibb
Vionate. This mixture is taken in small quantities.
In conclusion I suspect that sparrows--especially the European ones
--will continue to lack much interest for the majority of the avicul-
turists. Certainly the breed-now-or-all-will-be-lost brigade won't bother
with them. The fact remains however, that with the domesticus /
italiae/ hispaniolensis triangle there is an undoubted opportunity to
contribute to ornithological knowledge. It will be most interesting to
see the development of Herbert Murray's family of Spanish Sparrows.
It would be equally interesting to involve the Italian Sparrow and I

BREEDING THE SPANISH SPARROW
(Passer hispaniolensis)

In the early part of the year Robin Restall sent me a cock Spanish
Sparrow. As there did not seem much chance of getting a hen of its
own species, we thought that it would be a good plan to try and cross
this bird with an English (House) sparrow. The result, we imagined,
would be the Italian Sparrow.
During the course of the previous autumn the wild sparrows had
found a means of ingress to my large aviary and try as I would, I
could not locate the hole. Sparrows began to pour in and I had nearly
forty wild ones in the aviary before I found the point of entry, a small
gap in the wire where a pair of parrots had spent a long time playing
in the previous summer. No sparrow apparently ever went out by
means of this hole in the wire and how the wild birds located such a
small gap I do not know, but as I had no intention of feeding a mass
of sparrows all last winter, I repaired the gap and week by week
managed to catch and release outside the illegal immigrants. I got
out all save one, an active, intelligent hen that seemed to profit from
the mistakes of its friends. When the Spanish Sparrow arrived I
decided to keep&apos;the English bird for the summer to see if it would
pair with the Spaniard, but nothing was further from either of their
thoughts. Whether the differences in their natures stemmed from
religious, political or purely national grounds I do not pretend to
know, but the two birds ignored one another completely and absolutely.

As the season went on the Spanish Sparrow reached a state of
absolute frenzy and spent the day building nests, calling, displaying
and showing signs of completely demented desire that we cold English
dismiss as the Latin temperament. At this time a colony of African
Golden Sparrows were in full career in the same aviary, turning out
young far too freely and if an odd hen Golden Sparrow went close to
the Spaniard she was subjected to the full treatment, but on the whole
they just ignored him. The English Miss remained aloof and I never
saw even so much as an ardent glance pass between them.
Late in June, being by this time rather fed up with the constant
calling and displaying of the bird, I asked Colin Harrison how his pair
of Spanish Sparrows were doing, and as his birds showed little prospect
of going to nest and he very kindly brought them over and we released
them in my aviary.
Within a short time they went to nest, but my original Spanish
Sparrow still continued on his own with his endless calling and dis-
playing. The English Miss ignored the lot of them.
The Spanish Sparrows reared one young bird in a typical ball nest
in a joint where two pieces of wood met, but I regret that I cannot
give any incubation time, etc. as I did not interfere with the nest. The
young bird was fed on soft food and any live food going and looked
very like an English Sparrow. It begged for food from both parents
and is now completely self-supporting, but is terribly wild. The young
bird is a male and the English Sparrow has been released with her
virtue intact. The display was similar to that of the English Sparrow,
though not quite so violent, but I feel that if the Spanish Sparrows had
been in larger numbers the courtship would have been as boisterous as
one sees with our sparrows.
As described above, the Spanish Sparrow, Passer hispaniolensis , has
been bred by H. Murray. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain
or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the

BREEDING THE YPEGAHA WOOD RAIL AT
HAREWOOD BIRD GARDEN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987760317073171" page_id="56470737"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
By Peter B. Brown (Harewood, Nr. Leeds, Yorkshire)
Rails of the genus Aramides are found on the mainland of Central
and South America and are quite large birds with a general coloration
of greenish-brown, brown and grey. The largest of the genus is the
; Ypecaha or Giant Wood Rail (Aramides ypecaha ) occurring from
Brazil, to the Argentine, and it is this species which was successfully
; reared at the Harewood Bird Garden in 1973.
When alert, the Ypecaha Wood Rail stands approximately 15 in.
tall, and whilst not brilliantly coloured, it is a most attractive bird.
The sexes are identical in colouring which is as follows :\0x25A0-- Face, throat
and chest, grey. Crown, rear of neck, flanks and underparts warm
brown with a pinkish tinge. Back and wing-coverts greenish-brown
(a sort of khaki shade). Rump, tail and vent area black.
The bill is basically lime green with an orange tinge at the base
turning yellowish at the tip. It is a powerful beak sharply pointed
and approximately 3 in. long. The iris is a burning red and the legs
are also bright red. Sexing the birds presents a problem and I would
say that the female is slightly smaller, with the beak a little less heavy
than that of the male. The stance is very upright and they are far
from secretive birds, much preferring to be out in the open and indeed
I have never known them to skulk. They also have the rail habit of
flicking their tail up at right angles to the back with each step. In the
autumn of 1969 three of these birds were purchased and as the Bird
Garden was still in the process of being built, and the weather was
cooling, I decided to keep them in an inside flight for the winter.
During this time unfortunately, one bird, the smallest, was found dead,
quite plump and no outward pointer to the reason for death.
The other two birds were put in an outside aviary in the spring of
1970, and apart from the occasional skirmish, lived very contentedly
together until 1973 when they were separated. They were at no time
given a heated shelter, being only shut in on the very coldest nights,
and did not suffer in any way from frostbite. Yet one night of frost in
1971-72, admittedly very severe, so badly attacked a related rail, the
Cayenne Wood Rail (.Aramides cajanea), that the feet and half the
legs were affected and the bird had to be destroyed. The same frost
had no effect on the Ypecahas proving that the Cayenne Wood Rail
is not hardy and should not be left out in frosty conditions.
In the summer of 1972 a local dealer imported a pair of very young
Ypecaha Wood Rail by mistake and hurriedly rung me up to, (a) find
out what they were and (b) what they should be fed on. I saved him
the trouble and bought them although one of them was not able to

stand properly. They both fed very well, and the poor one soon ;
improved so that we had them in an outside aviary within a month, j
As I said they were quite young so we left them alone for the rest of
the season. By the Spring of 1973 they were fine strong birds, but I
smaller than our other pair so we decided to change them over, and
have an old and a new bird in each of two aviaries. I managed to i
obtain some 18 gallon wooden barrels, and with half of one end taken j
out, a barrel was laid on its side in the corner of each aviary; the whole
thing being camouflaged by several Yew branches covering it with the
entrance facing away from where the public could see. A generous
layer of straw was spread around the bottom of the barrel as an j
incentive to the birds.
No courtship or mating was seen, and, apart from the occasional
deafening chorus in the evening when all four birds struck up together,
no signs of excitement were observed. They are, incidentally, at these
times quite the loudest birds in the Bird Garden. The first egg was
reported as laid on the 27th April in the barrel provided, and by the
4th of May there were four eggs. On the following day the birds were
incubating well and we subsequently proved that they lay one egg each
day, so why the delay between the 1st May when Egg No. 4 should
have been laid and incubation on the 5th May, I cannot say. The
egg is perhaps more like a Coot's egg than any other, for it is creamy
white with small reddish-brown spots evenly spread over it. Measure-
ments of three eggs were--55 x 39.3, 56 x 40.8 and 57 x 39 mm. Both
birds took turns to incubate, and on the 28th May three young had
hatched with the fourth egg hatching on the following day. The young
stayed in the nest for 3 or 4 days, and were then led out by their
parents to the gap 3 in. wide between the barrel and the wall, and
this small area was their retreat and home until they were half grown.
The youngsters were fed by their parents for at least three weeks on
maggots, mealworms, and meat until they became a little adventurous
and started to hunt around for themselves.
This particular aviary has a pond and a stream running through it
so until I felt the young were big and strong enough I covered the
water with hessian, to prevent accidents which can so easily happen
with young birds. These four youngsters started life about the size of
a pheasant chick though with longer legs, and an overall colouring of
very dark mahogany brown; and as they grew, so they got a little, but
not much, lighter. They grew very rapidly, were devotedly cared for
by their parents and by the end of June were half-grown.
On a routine check on 7th July the nest was found to contain three
more eggs, and the second pair had also two eggs in their barrel. On
the 8th July, both nests contained five eggs, so presumably both pairs
laid their first on the 5th July. The pairs then settled down to
incubate. I did not feel that the youngsters were independent enough

at this stage to be separated as they were still being fed a little by their
parents, so they were left with them until 27th July when a little
belligerence was noted. Since in addition the eggs would be due to
hatch soon, the young were removed to another aviary. On the
30th July three eggs were found to have hatched and a fourth had a
crushed shell with a live chick inside. This was placed in an incubator
and the chick assisted out; the fifth egg was infertile. These chicks
spent the first few days in the nest, like the others, before moving
round to the back of the barrel, but they were not so keen on staying
there, and were often seen scrambling around the aviary following
their parents, whilst still quite small. Fortunately it was a dry period
and the chicks came to no harm apart from the one hatched in the
incubator which had been re-introduced, for this disappeared after a
week. The second pair meanwhile were incubating perfectly, but we
took the eggs away after they were two weeks overdue, and they were
all infertile.
The three young grew as quickly as the others and the parents then
decided in late August to go to nest once more, but this time they
chose to build a nest of grass on a ledge half way up in one corner of
the aviary. This position was quite open and exposed with the sitting
bird there for all to see. I was sure it was doomed to fail, and sure
enough the eggs were rolled out of the nest after a week. This was
the end of their efforts at nesting for 1973.
Their seven youngsters are all fit and well, two having gone to new
homes and the others at present still with us. The remaining two from
the first clutch are now quite indistinguishable from their parents,
whilst the other three, still with their parents in late October, differ by
being slightly less distinct in body colouring with the legs brownish-red
rather than bright red and the beak having a brownish tinge rather
than the clear yellow and green of the adults. The diet is made up
from a variety of meals, minced chicken and beef with some chopped
apple. Maggots and mealworms are given daily.

14 KAREN S. VOSS-OBSERVATIONS ON ADOPTION IN CRANES
OBSERVATIONS ON THE ADOPTION OF A SANDHILL
CRANE CHICK BY A PAIR OF MANCHURIAN CRANES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997645268292683" page_id="56470740"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
By Karen S. Voss (Baraboo, Wisconsin, U.S.A.)
During January, 1973, two Manchurian Cranes {Grus japonensis),
a male from the Philadelphia Zoological Society, and a female from
the Honolulu Zoological Society, were brought together at the Inter-
national Crane Foundation. They have paired as is evident by their
compatibility and nuptial displays (synchronized calls and dancing),
but did not attempt to nest this spring. Based on research done by
Dr. George Archibald at Cornell University on the rare White-naped
Crane (Grus vipio), we believe that the pair bond is strengthened
and the probability of nesting success increased after an inexperienced
pair has raised a foster chick. With this in mind, a Greater Sandhill
Crane chick [Grus canadenisis tabida) was introduced to the Manchu-
rian pair, and subsequently " adopted " by them. The procedure used
was as follows :
An egg collected from a wild nest was incubated at I.C.F. and
hatched on 13th May. In Japan the normal egg-laying season of the
Manchurian Crane is 1st April to 15th May.
At 46 days of age the chick was well feathered and was then placed
in a large (approximately 60 ft. x 60 ft.) indoor-outdoor pen, directly
adjacent to the pen containing the Manchurian pair. The chick was
thus in visual and vocal contact, but not in physical contact with
the pair. During this time both the male and female showed great
interest in the chick, often following it closely when it foraged along
their common fence. The male also danced and displayed several
times near the chick which in turn appeared to show little interest in
the adults.
After one week, the chick was placed for several hours with the
Manchurians, under close and constant supervision. Initially, the
chick appeared to pay little attention to them, foraging to within
several feet of the male. This resulted several times in threat displays
and chases by the male. Within an hour the chick became much more
wary of the adults, particularly the male, running rapidly away, giving
loud stress calls when either adult began to threaten or chase it.
The following day, the chick was again placed, under supervision,
with the Manchurian pair for several hours. Behaviour observed was
similar to that described above, except that the chick appeared less
wary of the male and the male was less aggressive towards it. Fewer
interactions were observed between the chick and the female. The
female threat-displayed several times when the chick foraged too
closely, but she either did not chase the chick at all or chased it only
a few steps.

For a second week the chick was still housed adjacent to the Man-
churians, and then placed with the pair, under close observation, for
several hours. By this time, the male's and chick's behaviour had
changed dramatically. The chick showed no fear whatever of the
male, and the male actually fed it. The male would catch an insect,
then walk rapidly, with head lowered, toward the chick. Occasionally
he would emit low clucking food presentation calls to which the chick
would immediately respond by running to him, uttering loud food-
begging calls, and take the insect from the adult's beak. At no time
since the end of the second week has the male been observed to
threaten or chase the chick. The female's behaviour towards the
chick has not changed since the first week. She appears to ignore it
unless it approaches very closely to her. Then she will make a pecking
movement towards it, and the chick will step away from her. The
chick in turn shows no fear of her, and will even occasionally nibble
at her feathers.
After the second week (on 15th July), a partition separating the two
pens was removed, and the three birds have been together since then.
In addition to the pair's behaviour towards their adopted offspring,
there were distinct changes in their behaviour towards each other,
and towards intruders.
Although the pair was mated before the chick was introduced,
sexual activity greatly increased after the adoption, even though the
the normal Manchurian Crane breeding season was over by mid-May.
The pair began calling and displaying together more frequently after
the adoption and we often heard the sexually distinct unison call (pair
duet), and guard and alarm calls were often given by both birds simul-
taneously. They could often be heard calling together throughout the
day and the female began giving the precopulatory call and pre-
copulatory posture more frequently after the chick had been adopted.
Both birds now do more dancing together than previously.
After the adoption, the pair became extremely defensive when
approached by any intruder (humans, other cranes, dogs). Even when
the intruder was several hundred yards away, they would begin unison
calling. When the intruder was near to, or inside the pen, the pair
would give alarm and guard calls. Prior to the adoption, both cranes
were quite timid and would move quickly away from anyone inside
their pen. About a week after the adoption, the male's behaviour
changed quite obviously; he would either stand firm, or move towards
the intruder, particularly if the intruder approached him.
As mentioned above, once a bird pair has begun breeding in cap-
tivity, they will usually continue to do so year after year, with none
of the difficulty experienced in getting the pair to breed the first time.
Our objective in using this adoption technique is to prepare the birds
for that first important nesting attempt, and to increase their chances

of breeding successfully the following year,
I think it is of great significance that we have been able to use
the young of a common species as a foster chick for a pair of very
rare cranes. Hence the technique can be quite readily used by persons
attempting to breed rare crane species. Conversely, adult pairs of
common crane species could also be used to adopt and raise chicks
of rare species. This might be a useful facet of any programme to
reintroduce birds raised in captivity to the wild.
Although we began adoption procedures when the chick was 46
days old, the use of younger chicks might well result in a stronger
pair bond in the adults, and greater parent-chick and chick-parent
bonds. Caution must be taken in using very young chicks, because of
their lower resistance to avian diseases, though under careful con-
ditions, it might be practicable to keep the chick in a brooder pen
adjacent to the pair's pen, and hence start the adoption process at a
very early age.
We shall not, of course, know until next spring how this successful
adoption will affect this Manchurian pair's willingness to breed, but
their behaviour this summer encourages us to be optimistic. It appears
that adoption is quite possible and may prove to be a valuable avi-
cultural technique, well worth further investigation and experimenta-
tion.
I would like to thank Dr. Archibald and Mr. Ronald Sauey,
Directors of the International Crane Foundation for opportunity to
observe cranes at I.C.F.; I particularly thank Dr. George Archibald
and also Dr. Edward Beals of the University of Wisconsin for help
and advice; Mr. Jack Thrope of the Honolulu Zoological Society and
Mr. John Griswold of the Philadelphia Zoological Society for their
generous loans of the two Manchurian cranes to I.C.F.; and the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for permitting two
Sandhill Crane eggs to be collected for raising the young at I.C.F.

BREEDING THE BLACK-CHEEKED WAXBILL,
ESTR 1 LDA ERYTHRONOTA
</sectionHeader>

By Denis G. Osborne (Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire)
The Black-cheeked Waxbill, Estrilda erythronota, is one of the larger
waxbills, about no mm. long of which 50 mm. comprises the tail. It
occurs in Africa, in the north-east and again in the south and south-
west.
The colouring of this bird is not easy to describe, the colours being
sombre and delicate shades of fawn and grey with crimson-red on the
underside and flanks, a crimson rump and black tail. There is a
conspicuous black cheek patch extending over the eye. There is fine
barring on some of the plumage, becoming black and conspicuous on
the wings. Both sexes have similar markings, but the male is slightly
brighter in colouring, especially in the crimson of the body, and with
the black cheek patch extending across the chin, in a much wider band
than in the female.
I purchased a true pair in December 1972 and kept them in a small
indoor cage of dimensions c. 3 ft. 5 in. x 1 ft. 7 in. (914 mm. x 480 mm.)
attached to an outside flight cage of similar dimensions. This outside
cage is well sheltered from the weather in a corner position and the
birds had access to it all through the winter which fortunately in
1 972/3 was very mild in comparison with other years. The birds were
locked indoors each evening and provided with warmth and light.
They were fed on a normal seed diet of white and panicum millet
(soaked and germinated mostly), supplemented with my own mix of
soft food, with as many titbits of lettuce, groundsel, apple etc. which
I could obtain through the winter. Under these conditions the hen
laid a total of 16 eggs over the winter months. These were laid in a
small wickerwork basket I had provided for roosting in the indoor
cage. At no time did the hen try to incubate.
About the middle of May I transferred the pair to a small green-
house 6 ft. x 4 ft. (1800 mm. x 1200 mm.) in which I have growing a
grape vine which is now 3 years old and which covers the whole of
the top of the greenhouse providing cover and shade for the birds.
The Black-cheeked were housed with a pair of Zosterops (Zosterops
palpebrosa) which also built nests but each time the 3 eggs laid were
infertile but the hen sat the full incubation period.
To help keep the greenhouse cooler in the height of the summer,
I obtained special whitener for the glass; also I took all the glass out
of the door and replaced it with wire netting for ventilation. In the
summer watering the vine and spraying inside the greenhouse gave a
real tropical atmosphere, for it was very hot and humid at times. This
seemed to encourage my fruit fly culture previously started in the

greenhouse to increase.
It was not long before I noticed the cock Black-cheeked carrying
large pieces of grass in his beak and displaying to the hen in a typical
nuptial display in waxbills i.e. bobbing up and down and at the same
time giving a long sweet whistling note. Later this was followed by
both birds bobbing up and down standing side by side with their heads
turned to face each other and with their tails moving from side to side.
At times, they would both knock their beaks on the perch as they do
when cleaning them. This type of display went on for a few days and
eventually I saw the hen stop in the middle of one of these nuptial
displays, stoop down and vibrate her wings and immediately copulation
took place.
They ignored the baskets and boxes placed in suitable positions
around the upper part of the greenhouse and started building high up
in the top part of the roof amongst the foliage of the vine. The cock
bird seemed to do most of the work of finding and carrying the
building material up to the hen who sat inside placing the large pieces
of grass into a large globular nest approx. 6 in. (150 mm.) in diameter
or even more. The nest itself looked untidy from the outside, but I
then noticed they had built a tunnel type entrance which led into the
centre of the nest. The entrance hole was very small and was facing
downwards at an angle of at least 45 degrees. I also noticed that the
entrance hole was nearly always covered over when the hen was
incubating.
The nest itself was made entirely of grasses which I placed about
the floor. The cock bird would snap off a length of grass and carry
it to the nest. The centre of the globe was lined with soft seeding heads
from the grasses after the seeds are eaten. You will understand from
the above notes how difficult it was for me to observe anything going
on inside the nest itself.
By the 9th June I noticed the hen was sitting in the nest and she
seemed to do most of the sitting, with the cock bird only, I believe,
taking his turn when she was off for feeding, but I can't be sure on
this point. It was approx. 14-16 days from the 9th June before I
noticed an increase in their consumption of food and it was at least
another week later before I noticed both the cock and hen off the nest
together taking in quantities of food. This activity increased over the
weeks and by now I was pretty certain of healthy youngsters, but how
many, I wondered?
At no time did I provide ants' eggs, but I gave them practically
everything else I could think of. I watched the parents take a little of
each of the various foods, as they knew exactly what was required.
They would eat large quantities of maggot pupae, then over to the
bread and milk and then large quantities of sprouting seed and heads
of seeding grasses. Also most meals included broken cuttle fish bone

and a little of my own soft food which contains many highly nutritious
ingredients. Branches full of aphids were also provided and eaten.
They may also have included in their diet the fruit flies but I was
unable to observe this.
By the 17th July I thought it must be time the young came out and
I was getting a little anxious as it was nearly six weeks since I had
observed the hen sitting, so I ventured into the greenhouse and tried
to look into the nest when to my surprise and great delight three
beautiful youngsters shot out fully feathered and in first class condition.
The first thing I noticed was that they had the exact colouring of the
adult birds except for their short tails which had grown to about half
their normal length, and the fleshy part at the base of the beak.
I put a split plastic ring on each so that I would be able to identify
them later. It was then that I saw I had two cock birds and one hen.
The parent birds continued to feed the young by regurgitating the
food after consuming mainly sprouting seed and fly pupae, and on the
23rd July I noticed the young birds feeding themselves from the pot
of soaked seed.
The parent Black-cheeked started to nest again on the 4th August
in a completely new nest but this effort came to nothing and I took
out three very small pure white eggs. All were infertile. I separated
the young birds from their parents on the nth August. In the wild
the separation of young and parents may have happened earlier but
I decided not to risk it for I noticed a little bickering between the
young and parents at this later stage but nothing serious.
The young birds went into a moult in early September and are now
in their winter plumage. In fact, one of the young cock birds and the
young hen have been displaying to each other and I found two
eggs on the cage floor at the time of writing this report which is early
November, so I have decided to separate them. The young birds will
be kept indoors for this coming winter.
These waxbills are described as being difficult to keep alive let alone
to breed, but I found them no more difficult than the Lavender
Finches which I bred in 1968.
As described above, the Black-cheeked Waxbill, Estrilda erythronota
has been bred by D. G. Osborne. It is believed that this may be a
first success. Anyone knowing of an earlier breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is asked to communicate at once
with the Secretary, Editor or Assistant Editor.

The ban on importation of birds into the United States imposed at
the end of 1972, has resulted in an increased import of Central and
South American birds into west European countries, and large con-
signments of neotropical birds including tanagers have reached
Belgium and the Netherlands.
Most of the tanagers were from Ecuador and Colombia, but small
consignments were also obtained from Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia, Para-
guay and Peru.
The following list gives the rare species (or subspecies) which were
included in these imports :

tropical part of South America; nevertheless, this remarkable cavity-
breeding tanager is rarely imported. This species has diverged so far
from the tanagers in its habits and structure, that it is placed in a
separate subfamily; although the colour and feather texture is also
found in certain callistes, and the sexual dimorphism is like that in the
Blue Dacnis (Dacnis cayana), Its bill is rather like that of a calliste,
but much broader at the gape, which is an indication of its fly-catching
habits. In captivity it does well on the usual tanager diet.

the genus with a distinct light to purplish blue crown and nape in both
sexes. This euphonia is distributed in approximately eleven isolated
populations throughout Central and South America, and the West
Indies.
The Chestnut-bellied Euphonia ( Euphonia pectoralis) is steel blue
above; the lower breast, belly and under tail-coverts, dark chestnut
with a small patch on the sides of the breast orange-yellow. This
euphonia is closely related to the Rufous-bellied and the Golden-sided
Euphonias ( Euphonia rufiventris and E. cayennensis). As suggested by
their names, the colour difference between the males of Euphonia
rufiventris and E. pectoralis , is the rufous ochraceous and the dark
chestnut underside respectively. These three Euphonia species prob-
ably originated from one common superspecies, which evolved into
three distinct species, after being geographically divided into three
populations.
The White-vented Euphonia (Euphonia minuta) is very small (less
than 4 in.). It is one of the two smaller euphonias occurring in
Colombia and Ecuador. The other species is the Fulvous-vented
Euphonia (. Euphonia fulvicrissa ), which has never been imported. As
indicated by their names, the males are distinguished by the white and
rufous under tail-coverts respectively. The female Euphonia fulvicrissa
has a distinct rufous forecrown and is more dark olive than the female
Euphonia minuta.
The Orange-eared Tanager ( Chlorochrysa calliparaea) is the most
widespread of the very delicately coloured Chlorochrysa. These diffi-
cult tanagers are highly insectivorous, and require a large variety of
live food. They are especially fond of fruit flies (Drosophila), ant
pupae and mealworm pupae.
The Peruvian Paradise Tanager (Tangara chilensis chlorocorys)
differs from the regularly imported nominate race by having a more
yellow instead of crimson rump.
The Green-headed Tanager (Tangara seledon) is closely related to,
but not so beautifully coloured as the Seven-coloured or Superb Tana-
ger (Tangara fastuosa). Both species are extremely hardy, but tend to
be rather pugnacious in a mixed collection.
The Red-necked Tanager (Tangara cyanocephala) is a small calliste,
with a beautiful head pattern of blue and red. These tanagers are
rather sensitive in regard to nutrition, and require careful acclimatisa-
tion. They were bred in 1967 by Mrs. K. M. Scamell (England).
The Orange- or Brassy-breasted Tanager (Tangara desmaresti) is
very delicately coloured and timid. The sky blue forecrown and eye
ring give it a somewhat gentle appearance. Tangara desmaresti should
not be confused with the so-called Desmarest's Green Tanager (Tan-
gara gyrola viridissima).

seledon, T. cyanocephala and T. desmaresti, and also Stephanophorus
diadematus ) which arrived during the past months, were often heavily
infected with salmonellosis or aspergillosis.
The Yellow-bellied Tanager ( Tangara xanthogastra) belongs to the
group of " spotted " tanagers, which also includes the Spotted,
Speckled and Dotted Tanagers ( Tangara punctata, guttata and varia).
Tangara xantho gastra (5 in.) looks like a small, more yellowish green
Tangara guttata (6 in.). Its belly is a beautiful yellow, in contrast with
the white ones of Tangara guttata and punctata .
The Rufous-throated Tanager ( Tangara rufguld) resembles a rufous
Tangara guttata, but has a black crown, and a distinct rufous throat.
The colour pattern is also more scaly, rather than spotted.
The inverse colour pattern of the " spotted " callistes is found in the
Beryl-spangled Tanager {Tangara nigroviridis ), which has a black
ground-colour, covered with bluish-green spots.
The Orange-crowned Tanager {Tangara xanthocephala lamprotis )
differs from the Yellow-crowned Tanager {Tangara x. xanthocephala )
in having an orange instead of the yellow crown, thus giving it a more
Flame-faced Tanager appearance {Tangara parzudakii).
The Metallic-green Tanager {Tangara labradorides) is a small silvery
green calliste, with a typical black head colour pattern. This species
was found to be rather delicate, being insectivorous and fond of ant
pupae and white mealworms.
The Rufous-headed or Scrub Tanager {Tangara vitriolina) was
found in large numbers in shipments from Colombia. This tanager
can be confused with the northern subspecies of the Cayenne Tanager
{Tangara cayana). But the upperparts are silvery straw coloured in
Tangara cayana, and silvery green in Tangara vitriolina.
The Chestnut-backed Tanager {Tangara preciosa) is one of the
typical south Brazilian species, which is imported only occasionally.
The male has a bright coppery chestnut head and mantle, an ochra-
ceous to greenish lower back and bluish-green underparts. The female
is mostly green, only the crown and nape being coppery chestnut.
The subspecies atrocaerulea of Tangara vassorii differs from the
uniform shining purple-blue nominate race, the Blue and black Tanager
by having a conspicuous silvery straw-coloured nuchal patch and a
more or less spotted underside.
The Green-throated Tanager {Tangara argyforenges) is very rare.
The male is remarkably coloured, being mostly black with a silvery
green throat, and silvery straw-coloured flanks and back. The female
is mostly green, silvery on throat and breast, yellowish on back and
flanks. A male of this species, together with certain other tanagers
from Bolivia, were purchased from Ch. Cordier (Cochabamba,
Bolivia) by Antwerp Zoo (Belgium). The whole shipment consisted of
seldom seen species or subspecies.

The Golden-collared Tanager [Tan gar a pulcherrima) has been pre-
viously classified as a honeycreeper ( Iridophanes pulcherrima ), where
it was placed between the Cyanerpes honeycreepers and the Dacnis,
together with the Green Honeycreeper (Chlorophanes spiza). Recently
it was transferred by Storer to the genus Tangara. The status of this
tanager remains dubious; the bill form is somewhat intermediate
between Chlorophanes spiza and Tangara vassorii, while in general
behaviour and feeding preferences, it follows the Green Honey-
creeper, both being very fond of nectar and fruit flies, and flying in
the same swift, fluttering manner. However, its colour pattern closely
resembles that of the Black-headed Tanager (Tangara cyanoptera ),
with which it also shares sexual dimorphism. Although most hand-
books do not mention any sexual difference, the female Tangara
pulcherrima differs from the male in that it lacks the golden collar,
and has a greenish back and a greyish breast and throat.
The Diademed Tanager (Stephonophorns diadematus ) is a remark-
able species with a stout, bullfinch-like bill, which is rather unusual
for this family. The snow-white crest, crimson in the centre, is raised
with little provocation. The female has a less brilliantly coloured
crest. This tanager was bred by Mrs. K. M. Scamell in 1965.
The Bolivian subspecies, flavinuchus , of the Blue-winged Mountain
Tanagers ( Anisognathus flavinuchus) differs from the more commonly
seen subspecies, in having a black back and shining blue rump and
the yellow crown patch is also narrower. The Blue-winged Mountain
Tanager was bred in the Keston Foreign Bird Farm (England) in 1962.
The Lacrymose Mountain Tanager (Anisognathus lacrymosus) is
closely related to, and has about the same colour pattern as, the Scarlet-
bellied Mountain Tanager ( Anisognathus igniventris), except for a
tear-like orange spot below the eye. Both Anisognathus species were
placed by de Schauensee in one genus with the previous Compsocoma
species ( Compsocoma flavinucha and notabilis), although both groups
of mountain tanagers differ greatly in general behaviour, e.g. perching
position, calling activities, etc. The Hooded Mountain Tanager
(Buthraupis montana) is a sturdily built bird (8 in.), with a black, blue
and yellow colour pattern. This species is protected and is therefore
rarely imported.
The Chestnut-bellied Mountain Tanager (Delothraupis castaneo-
ventris) is a very rare species, previously called Dubusia, and recently
placed by Storer in a separate genus of its own again. The silvery
blue crown, the black sides of the head and especially the conspicuous
black moustachial streak give it a rather untanager-like appearance.
This mountain tanager is highly insectivorous and moves through the
vegetation in a quick, stealthy manner, always on the lookout for
insects.
The Ornate or Golden-chevroned Tanager ( Thraupis ornata) is the

only Thraupis with a sharp, pointed bill; even so its behaviour is
typical of the Thraupis species. This tanager was bred to the second
generation by H. Murray (England).
The Sayaca Tanager ( Thraupis sayaca) is a duller version of the
Blue-grey Tanager {Thraupis episcopus ), to which it is closely related,
and which it replaces in the southern part of tropical South America.
The Blue-capped Tanager {Thraupis cyanocephala :) is a delicately
coloured species. As with all this genus, the species mentioned are
not difficult to feed.
The Vermillion Tanager {Calochaetes coccineus) is a very rare and
beautiful species, related to Ramphocelus. It resembles the Masked
Crimson Tanager {Ramphocelus nigrogularis), but only the mask,
throat, wings and tail are black; the mantle and centre of the belly
being vermillion. The red colour in both species is caused by a
different carotenoid, being astaxanthin in the Ramphocelus species
and canthaxanthin in Calochaetes . The Summer Tanager {Piranga.
flava) is the only all rosy red tanager with a pale bill. The Hepatic
Tanager {Piranga rubra) is slightly larger, and has a dark bill with a
conspicuous notch in the upper mandible.
The Scarlet Tanager {Piranga olivacea) resembles the Brazilian
(Scarlet) Tanager {Ramphocelus bresilius) in colour, but not in general
behaviour. Piranga olivacea , like all the genus, has a light, swift
flight. It is the only tanager which moults into winter plumage, when
it differs from the female by having black instead of brown wings and
tail. This North American Piranga was imported from its wintering
grounds in Colombia. When no artificial colour food is given, the
red colour of both species fades during the first moult in confinement,
and is replaced by dull grey. The Stripe-backed or Flame-coloured
Tanager {Piranga bidentata) arrived in a shipment of grosbeaks
(Pheucticus species) from Mexico. Typical of this large tanager is the
double-toothed bill, the distinct white wing-bars and especially the
black tail with white on the tips below. It has a sharp and metallic
call-note.
All Piranga species are very fond of live food (mealworms, ant
pupae, maggots, etc.) and seem to take little fruit.
The Olive-green Tanager {Orthogonys chloricterus) is olive tinted,
with greenish upperparts and yellowish underparts. This large tanager 1
from southern Brazil, has a long tail and slender black bill.
The male Scarlet-browed Tanager {Heterospingus xanthopygius ) is j
mostly black with yellow shoulders and rump, and white pectoral
tufts. The conspicuous eye-tufts are made up of feathers varying in
colour from yellowish white to scarlet, and which spring from behind 1
the eye. The female is greyish black above, and dark grey below, with
a yellow rump and white pectoral tufts. The Danish veterinary sur-
geon and tanager specialist E. Norgaard-Olesen, owned a female some ;

years ago. This tanager is fond of live food, and all kinds of berries.
The male proves rather pugnacious and attacks other&apos; tanagers alight-
ing on the feeding table, even the larger Ramphocelus and Thraupis
; species.
The Magpie Tanager ( Cissopis leveriana) is unusual in that it has
pure glossy black and white plumage, and a long graduated tail. It
is the largest of all tanagers (11 in.).
The male Black-faced Tanager {Schistochlamys melanopis) is grey,
with an extensive black mask. The female is olive green, somewhat
paler below. This tanager belongs to a transital genus between the
tanagers and the cardinal finches (Cardinalinae), including saltators,
cardinals and certain grosbeaks. This species includes some seed in its
diet.

BREEDING THE BLUE-CROWNED CHLOROPHONIA
Chlorophonia occipitalis

Blue-crowned Chlorophonias are outstandingly beautiful, being a
brilliant emerald green, with bright blue caps, and rings of a similar
blue colour round the back and sides of the neck. The flight and tail
feathers end in black tips, while with the hens the green underneath
merges into a beige colour towards the tail. The cock bird sports a
bright yellow waistcoat and in addition to his blue neck ring he has
some dark brown round the front of his neck.
The birds are approximately six to seven inches long. They have no
song but chatter away in a most conversational manner interrupted
with occasional inelegant squawks. They are extremely energetic,
especially in the evening when they fly restlessly from one end of the
aviary to the other. I cannot imagine them thriving or being happy in
a cage.
Although they only infrequently take a bath in spite of the fact that
one is always provided, there is nothing they like more than a heavy

shower--whether from the sky or from a garden hose; and they will
invariably manage to hang upside down from a perch in order to get
thoroughly soaked.
They are perfectly amiable with other birds and when at first they
were sharing an aviary with Avadavats, Zebra Finches, Green and Grey
Singing Finches, none of these ever showed the slightest fear of them,
although sometimes rather disconcerted by their excited flying activi-
ties. Physically they seem very hardy, and provided that they have a
heated shed (64*F.) they seem to suffer no ill effects even from being
out in the snow.
They take a great interest in their food, and as extras find much
enjoyment in tackling the problems of sprays of blackberries, rowans,
black currants, wortleberries, cherries and in fact anything that is avail-
able. They are very clever and thorough when eating grapes, extract-
ing every morsel of the flesh to leave a perfectly empty skin; the same
method also being used to deal with maggots.
Chlorophonias could be described as birds of considerable character
and very rewarding for the expense and effort involved in keeping
them. My experience with breeding them has been as follows :--
1968. In spring I bought one pair of Blue-crowned Chlorophonias,
sold as tanagers. They had only arrived from Mexico the day before,
and were in pretty poor shape. After a short time and in greatly
improved condition they were put into an outside aviary with a heated
shed, already containing the numerous small seed-eaters, and they kept
very well all through the winter.
1969. Some time during May the pair nested in an open box in the
flight which is partly protected with corrugated plastic sheets. I think
they had four eggs which were duly hatched. Despite every attention
from the parents the young died within four to five days.
1970. The same thing happened as in the previous year, despite my
efforts to provide extra food by breeding fruit flies, of which the birds
took no notice whatever. They had their usual diet of every imaginable
kind of fruit--banana being their favourite--with maggots and meal-
worms, the latter not being much liked except in the pupal form.
Various artificial insectile food was given them, but they would not
touch it. They have always had Abidec and Delrosa in their drinking
water, and the parents were in really magnificent condition. I always
noticed that as soon as the eggs were hatched the adults became frantic
for something; for they clung to the gate the moment that I appeared
and climbed all over me searching for the missing something, but this
I again failed to find, and the babies died.
1971. Undeterred by previous failures my pair again nested in early
May and hatched three out of five eggs, and once again they and I
nearly went mad trying to find the answer, which resulted in the usual
death of the young. I vowed I would never let them breed again, they

were so distressed by the recurring fatalities. Then in the May-June
issue of this magazine there appeared an article by Mr. Roles, the
assistant curator at Jersey Zoo, recording that although he had man-
aged to breed from a pair of euphonias he had lost some young because
he had not been able to keep up a sufficient supply of live spiders.
I knew that tanagers, euphonias and chlorophonias were related, so
my immediate reaction was " can this be the clue? ". My birds were
only too anxious to nest again, so I let them, but reduced the eggs
from five to three. From the moment the little birds were hatched the
hunt was on, and a daily supply of live spiders was fed to the parents,
who regurgitated them to their young. I know it is straining belief
when I say that the joy and relief of the parents were absolutely
unmistakable. A noble friend and I spent hours each day searching
for these elusive and agile creatures which we put into jam jars, these
having the only unclimbable surface. Spiders are also very cannibal-
istic and they must be sorted into different jars, or one ends by having
one very large spider. The really large ones can give quite a penetrat-
ing nip, and the birds diving into the jars which we held for them
became extremely wary as to how they caught hold of them.
In addition the birds had all their other food listed earlier; plus a fruit
" mush " made of equal quantities of grated apple, banana, honey,
one of the tinned baby foods such as veal, and some of the insectile
food which was thereby disguised. It was very hot while the young
were in the nest and I used to feed both the hen while brooding, and
afterwards the young, with their drink mixture from a dropper, which
they quickly learned to appreciate. As the days went by I grew more
and more hopeful. After three weeks the young left the nest and
turned out to be two hens and a cock, the latter unfortunately dying
in November, 1972 from visceral gout, diagnosed on a post mortem at
the Wickham Laboratories.
1972. The original pair nested again and laid five eggs, of which I
again removed some, three this time, and the remaining two were
hatched and the young brought up as in the previous year. They
turned out to be a pair. I bought a new cock to introduce new blood.
His markings were slightly different, as he had a yellow band across
his forehead and his cap was of a slightly mauver shade of blue. This
is apparently the Costa Rica and West Panama race, C. o. callophrys ,
sometimes called the Golden-browed Chlorophonia.
1 973* The new cock mated with the young hen from 1972, and
they brought up two young (three eggs removed). These were doing
very well when by some mischance one of them was choked by a piece
of wool in the nesting material. Incidentally by this time I had had
an addition made to the aviary which the chlorophonias had to them-
selves except for a pair of Vernal Hanging Parrots. Meanwhile the
two sisters from 1971 shared a nest, sitting side by side in a hanging

basket, having mated, I believe, with their father. I am afraid this was
more than I could cope with, especially as I had lost most of my best
spider sites to builders, so rather sadly I removed the whole nest,
finding that some of the eggs were fertile.
The eggs were white, covered with rather faint fawn blotches, and
for nest material the birds used mostly dried grass, a few feathers, bits
of wool, leaves and hair--the latter mostly pulled from my head!
The incubation period is approximately fifteen days, the young emerg-
ing from the nest about three weeks after hatching; and the parents
continue to feed them for about another two weeks. Then quite
suddenly the day comes when the parents are no longer interested in
spiders, and as the young will not take them themselves I realise with
a sigh of relief that a backbreaking task is over for another season.
The present numbers are as follows--one hen bought 1968, the old
cock having died this summer; 1971 two hens from the above pair,
(and cock which died 1972); 1972 one hen, one cock from original pair,
one cock bought; 1973 one, sex unknown, from 1972 hen and new
cock. Total seven, of which five are home-bred over three years.
As described above the Blue-crowned Chlorophonia, Chlorophonia
occipitalis has been bred by Miss M. P. Gourlay from 1971 onwards.
It is believed this may be a first success. Any member or reader
knowing of a previous breeding of the species in Great Britain or
Northern Ireland is asked to communicate at once with the Secretary,
Editor or Assistant Editor.

Since 1967 our pair of Andean Condors ( Vultur gryphus) have
hatched one young each year, and as the parents either overfed their
offspring or they were lost by accident in previous years, we had the
young hand-reared since 1967 by our very efficient bird-keeper and
from that time we reared them safely. This April a male was hatched
and was hand-reared by the keeper so that we now have four young
Condors, two of each sex.
With the Hawaiian Geese ( Branta sandvicensis ) we have had a
breeding success for the third year (two chicks).
Other rare offspring are three Australian Silver Gulls ( Larus novae-
hollandiae), and following last year's first zoo-bred Boobook Owl in
Europe, these owls again hatched one young.
Spring has been a very rich and successful season concerning breed-
ing, for in addition to the above mentioned species there were hatched
the following birds :

Rare Parrots in the Berlin Zoo
This spring the Berlin Zoo purchased two Vulturine or Pesquet's
Parrots ( Psittrichas fulgidus). Scientists are still uncertain as to how
these strange birds should be classified : they remind one of Grey
Parrots in a way, but their bills are weaker, less curved and longer.
They seem to me rather crow-like in body shape and they are about
the size of the Carrion Crow. The body colour is mainly black and
the lesser wing-coverts and belly are bright red; the facial area is bare
of feathers. They are birds of the mountain forests of New Guinea
from 2,400 to 6,000 ft. and the natural food consists of berries and
other fruits, foliage and buds. Little is known of the natural life of
these parrots which are said to live in pairs or small groups. The
natives consider them quite rare and sometimes keep specimens, feed-
ing them on rice and fruit.
The first living specimens were brought to Europe (England) in
the 1920s and the Berlin Zoo received two in 1931 and 1934 where
they lived for several years. Here the diet consists of cooked rice,
raisins, banana, buttered bread, egg, salad and the blanched chicory,
this last item being one of their favourite foods.
A coloured plate of Psittrichas fulgidus has been published in the
Avicultural Magazine.

For some eighty years the Avicultural Magazine has been con-
sidered the best in the world of its kind. It has recorded the greater
part of the observations made on living birds kept in captivity under
conditions which often permit investigations otherwise impossible.
Early in this century it was generally thought that these investiga-
tions were of little biological value, but the works of Konrad Lorenz
and of a few other ornithologists, including my own, have changed
this attitude and aviculture is now recognised as an important tech-
nique for biological studies and itself a science.
The high standard of our magazine has been upheld throughout
the years by the excellence of our Editors, two of whom have been
women. I had the greatest esteem for the late Miss Ethel Chawner
who occupied the position with distinction for a number of years : the
other feminine Editor has been Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith who has
just retired after 34 years of the most remarkable and successful tenure
of office. I am particularly happy to express here the tremendous
gratitude due to her from all members of our Society--the more so
since I was instrumental in persuading her to accept the burden of the
Editorship just before the last war. We were then in dire need of help
and though she was reluctant to undertake such a difficult task, Miss
Barclay-Smith has proved to be an outstanding Editor who has for so
long maintained the high standard of our magazine, even under the
exceptionally difficult conditions of wartime when publication was
never halted.
In the name of our whole membership, as well as in my own, I ask
Miss Barclay-Smith to accept this tribute of our very special apprecia-
tion of so much work so well done.

A success story from Mr. J. S. Rigge in Cumberland whose Green-
winged Macaws (Ara chloroptera ) have again bred in 1973, rearing
three young. They have bred each year since 1962, when Mr. Rigge
received the Society's Medal for the first breeding in Great Britain, and
have now reared a total of 21 young. Mr. Rigge wonders whether there
is any record of more than this being reared from one pair and would
welcome further information from any fellow members. This fecundity
is not without problems and Mr. Rigge writes, " The parents don't
look a day older than when I first purchased them in 1956 when fully
adult, and if they continue breeding as regularly as they are at the
moment, they are even likely to cause me some embarrassment housing
the young while I find suitable homes for them."

The London Zoo, in a recent newsletter, give details of their success
with the owls. In the last 10 years alone, n species or subspecies have
bred and 137 young have been successfully reared. Six of these species
or subspecies are first time breedings and at least three probably world
first. The Snowy Owl pair, the male of which is at least 23 years old,
have reared 14 young since 1969. The Kenya Eagle Owls have reared
37 since 1962 when the first young was produced. The original male
died in 1970, by then at least 17 years old; another male was intro-
duced and breeding began again after a gap of two years. African
Spotted Eagle Owls have reared 32 young since beginning to breed in
1959. The Savigny's Eagle Owls, only introduced to each other in
1972, have reared 13 young, including two broods in 1973. Although
the Spectacled Owls have produced a single young in each of the last
three years, the last two have been killed by one of the parents, and in
future a fosterer will be used.

The Lazuli Bunting, Passerina amoena has been bred, for what
appears to be the first time within the British Isles, in the aviaries of
Mrs, G. M. Harrison-Wells at Mennor, Lelant, St. Ives, Cornwall.
Mrs. Harrison-Wells writes : " In June this year I purchased a pair
of Lazuli Buntings, my intention being to add them to my show team.
I put them with other exhibition birds in an aviary away from the
main aviaries where parrakeets, owls, pheasants and finches, as well as
my exhibition Budgerigars are housed. The buntings had as their
companions in seclusion a pair each of Heck's Grassfinches, Star Fin-
ches, Yellowhammers, a Gouldian and a Cuban Finch and here they
settled down well, being seen mostly on the ground under low bushes.
Earlier I had put up various nest-boxes and baskets in the honeysuckle
which grows in abundance in the aviary, shrouding the boxes where
necessary with heather, and I supplied a variety of nesting materials.
The following month I noticed that the hen bunting was taking a lot
of interest in an open-fronted nesting box and later I found that the
front of this box had been built up with dry grass, moss and hair, but
that the hen sat at the back on the bare base of the box. I did not
disturb her in any way, but I noticed that the grassfinches spent a lot
of time around and on this box. About a week later I found two
newly hatched dead chicks in different places on the ground, but could
not be certain that they were young buntings. I then removed the
grassfinches and Star Finches in case they were causing disturbance and
not long afterwards the hen bunting returned to the same nest-box
where she would sit and watch me while I put out the food which
consisted of seeding grasses, chickweed, mixed small seeds and meal-
worms, the mealworms being eagerly taken.
A couple of weeks later I again found a chick dead on the floor; it
had started to feather on the wings and I presumed that the Lazuli
Buntings were its parents. I then broke all rules and looked in the
nest, finding to my surprise a large chick alive and well, and two days
later it left the nest. There was one egg remaining in the nest; it was
of a beige colour with spots of deeper beige. I wonder whether the
exceptionally hot summer of 1973 was a factor in the breeding success
of these buntings."

David Fleay, at the Burleigh Fauna Reserve in Queensland, Aus-
tralia, has bred the Grey Goshawk, Accipiter novaehollandiae. There
are two young. This species is dimorphic and individuals may be either
grey or pure white. The parents were a white male and a grey female.
He also has hybrids between the Whistling Eagle, Haliastur sphenurus ,
and the Red-backed Sea Eagle, H. indus, the latter perhaps better
known as the Brahminy Kite. These also have two young.

Herbert Murray, in sending us his account of the breeding of the
Spanish Sparrow, also comments : " As regards other breedings cer-
tainly the most numerous were the Golden Sparrows. They go to nest
and breed before getting into full colour. I should imagine that in their
natural surroundings they must have many enemies, otherwise Africa
would be solid with them. Yellow-rumped Serins bred, and my colo-
nies of Red-eared and St. Helena Waxbills produced a fair number of
youngsters. One young Yellow-backed Tanager was reared. It is
always a pleasure to breed a difficult bird of this nature."

Mr. Tom Spence, Director of the Perth, Western Australia, Zoo
writes to say that the bird collection there now numbers nearly three
hundred native species and that the breeding successes include some
species of Honey-eater not previously bred in captivity. Among other
birds reared in the gardens are Black-winged Stilts (now nesting them-
selves), Banded Stilt and Australian Avocet. Recently hatched Pink-
eared ducks are thriving.
A feature of the gardens is the collection of native plants and
recently a film was made showing how species of Honey-eater pollinate
the curious flowers of the species of Kangaroo Paw ( Anigozanthos ).

Members who visited Chester Zoo this autumn were very impressed
by the number of species that were breeding. Emus and Rheas had
been raised by their own parents, or to be more exact, by the long-
suffering male. Breedings of Blue-eyed Cockatoo, Slaty-breasted Rail,
and Jungle Mynah are probably first breedings in Britain. Other
species included the Red-headed and Yellow-breasted Buntings, Nan-
day Conure, Rothschild's Mynah, or Grackle, Grand Eclectus Parrot,
Weka Rail (a second generation I believe) and Jerdon's Starling. There
were also a number of partial successes which altogether added up to
a very impressive breeding programme.
The " News and Views " feature can only be as interesting as
members make it. If you have any interesting notes about your collec-
tion or others which you have visited, please do take the trouble to
write to us.

CAGE BIRD IDENTIFIER. By Helmut Bechtel, trans. by

K. T. Dutfield, London : Oak Tree Press Co. (1973). No price
given.
The title of this pocket-sized book is unfortunate. It will not help in
the general identification of any but the commoner species of cage
birds, but is in fact an introduction, in colour, to a typical range of
the birds commonly encountered in cages and aviaries. It consists of
a series of colour photographs, usually a portrait of a single male,
on the right hand page; faced on the left by a short text giving a
series of general facts about the bird and its suitability for aviary or
cage, its food, and the likelihood of breeding in captivity. The photo-
graphs are sharp and mostly of good colour but sometmes too close
for more than head and shoulder portraits. It covers about 120
species, ranging from barbets to crows, but with an emphasis mainly
on small seedeaters, and to a lesser extent on parrots. In summary it
is a mistitled work that might be of interest to the beginner in bird-
keeping.

DIE VOEDING VAN VOGELS. By J. P. Holsheimer. Zutphen,
Netherlands: B.V.W.J. Thieme &amp; Cie, 1973. Price 16.90 Guil-
ders (c. #2.50).
This slim volume of c. 120 text pages is entirely devoted to
bird food and feeding. The first part deals with the functions of the
alimentary canal, and the basic theory of nutrition and utilisation of
food as it applies to birds; including the vitamins and minerals.
The second part concerns the various types of foods, listing the seeds
and tabulating analyses of their food and amino-acid contents. It also
deals with various manufactured protein foods. After a section on the
needs of birds under different conditions the various types of bird
are dealt with in turn, and diet mixtures recommended. In the case
of small seedeaters mixtures with varying proportions of main con-
stituent seeds are listed, and total protein and fat contents of mixtures
indicated. The author suggests that such diets are deficient in some
amino-acids and recommends an additional compensatory compound.
Finally there is a short section on dietary ailments. The work appears
to be a valuable summary on the subject, especially for the non-
zoologist; and it is a pity that unless a translation becomes available
the language barrier will limit its usefulness for most of our readers.

TANAGERS. Vol. 1. By E. Norgaard-Olesen, trans. by S. Bruhn.
Skibby, Denmark : Skibby Books. 75.00 Danish Crowns.
Most aviculturists have a favourite group of birds, and often acquire
a deep and detailed knowledge of them, but few manage to produce
a book on the subject. Mr. Norgaard-Olesen has for many years been
interested in tanagers and has compiled data and illustrations of the
birds, finally combining them into this work. The book has been
produced in Danish, as a two-volume work "Tangarer", and with the
publication of the second volume the publishers have produced the
English translation of the first volume, reviewed here, and promise
the second for next year.
Field study and avicultural information on tanagers is scanty and
the book is mainly a systematic listing and description of the various
species and subspecies with ancillary information where available. The
present volume covers sixteen genera and consists of an examination
of these species by species, or subspecies by subspecies. The pattern
for each is to give the Latin name with a comment on its meaning,
followed by the common name in various languages. A paragraph is
devoted to the synonymy of the Latin names, necessary perhaps in a
group where classification is still fluid; but long in some instances
and occupying more space than it deserves. There is a diagnostic
plumage description of male and female, with conventional measure-
ments. Where subspecies occur these are treated as separate entities
but the plumage description is given in full with the first and differ-
ences quoted under the others.
The distribution of each form is given, with a distribution map for
each species, with subspecific distributions marked. It is unfortunate
that the map is often a small reproduction of South and Central
America, and where distributions are limited keen eyesight is required
at times to make sense of them. Finally, information is given on the
bird in the wild, and any information on it in captivity. Where
detailed study has occurred fairly full data may be given, but in
general these sections indicate the lack of information on most
tanagers.
The book commences with rather brief sections on tanagers in the
wild and on aspects of tanager keeping. In these, and in the text
generally the translation is at times literal and a little awkward, but
the meaning is usually clear.
Illustrations are a problem in works of this kind and the author has
relied largely on colour photographs of variable quality, about three
to a page, which together with two painted plates and some mono-
chrome photographs illustrate some fifty forms.
This is undoubtedly a useful work covering a field not adequately
dealt with elsewhere. It is a little uneven in content and perhaps a
little too academically taxonomic at times. Most aviculturists will

them find their way around it. It is a much-needed reference work
for the tanager keeper, but not really for general reading.

THE SOCIETY'S MEDAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999475264705882" page_id="56470776"  page_num="39" year="" vol="">
When, in 1896, the Avicultural Society's Medal award was instituted,
all the members lived within the British Isles. Now some 40 per cent of
them are resident elsewhere and so, I submit, it is time for a re-
appraisal of this award.
It is, of course, given (subject to certain conditions) to members who
breed species not known previously to have been bred in Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, and it could be said that the rules are now of
too parochial a nature and that members resident here are given a
benefit denied to others who pay the same rate of subscription. There
is also an element of farce about it--for instance a member living in
Northern Ireland would be eligible while one living just across the
border in Eire would not.
The rules do not specifically say so, but it has always been assumed
that the birds must be bred as in nature and that those hand-reared or
raised in any other artificial way would not qualify, but the medal is
an award of merit and it is surely more skilful artificially to incubate
eggs and rear young than it is to leave it to the parents.
Then there is the matter of species and subspecies : in 1896 life was
more simple and many forms that were then considered distinct species
are now known to be geographical races and so it goes on as more
becomes known about the relationships of birds. The rules say : " The
question of awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-
species of species that have already been bred shall be at the discretion
of the Council ". That is a recipe for inconsistency and in any case, is
it any less meritorious to breed a subspecies for the first time when
another of the same species has already been bred? It could be argued
that a first or any breeding of birds is its own reward and that the
abolition of the award is the simplest solution, but it does seem a pity
not to mark a first breeding in some way, though to do so on a world-
wide basis is hardly practicable.
Around the turn of the century the Rev. C. D. Farrar, himself the
breeder of several " firsts ", wrote frequently about his birds, the
articles being later re-published in the form of two books. He often
ended his accounts with an entertaining story and one of these con-

"Who knows what nine eights are?" "Gawd", replied the village

PLUMAGE VARIATIONS OF THE BANDED PITTA
</sectionHeader>

By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts.)
The Banded or Blue-tailed Pitta Pitta guajana shows some striking
differences in various parts of its range, the most conspicuous variation
being in the colour of the underside of the male. The accompanying
plate by C. B. Frith shows the plumage of both sexes of the three
main types.
The top pair represent the typical Banded Pitta P. g. affinis of West
Java. The nominate race P. g. guajana occurs in East Java and Bali,
but the two forms are very similar, the only difference being in the
width of the blue band across the top of the breast. This is said to be
nearly 10 mm. wide in the nominate form, but since such descriptions
are based on museum skins in which the manner of stuffing may affect
such areas of plumage there may be reason for some reservations about
the separation of these two, and it would be very difficult to be certain
which was which in captive birds of unknown origin. The male illus-
trated is an exceptionally dull-coloured specimen. There appears to
be individual variation in colour, but most males show a strong yellow
or bronzy-yellow suffusion over the lighter parts of the underside and
extending up onto the pale cheeks. In this respect they resemble the
Borneo birds, but they lack the blue belly patch.
The next pair are of the race in which the male has a striking violet-
blue breast. This race, P. g. irena , which occurs through Sumatra,
Malaya and Siam is sometimes called Van den Bosch's or Van den
Boch's Pitta. Deignan, in 1946, suggested the separation of the
Malayan and Siamese forms as another race, P. g. ripleyi, but the
characters he uses, rather fine variations in colour, would seem from
British Museum specimens to be so finely differentiated as to be of
little use for practical purposes.
The form in Borneo, P. g. schwaneri (below), is yellow on the
underside in the male, with a blue belly patch and there are traces
of the yellow and blue on the underside of the female. Little seems to
be known about this race in its natural haunts.
The present number of the Magazine contains an account of the
breeding of the blue-breasted race at Blackpool. Pittas are infrequently
bred and this seems to be only the second successful breeding of a
pitta species in Britain.

Pittas or jewel thrushes are birds of tropical forest ranging from
Africa to the Solomon Islands and Australia. They live mainly on
the ground and the food consists mostly of worms, snails and various
insect life. Although in the wild the nests are usually on or near the
ground, they have also been located in trees to a height of 30 feet.
The nests are large and globular with a circular side entrance and
composed of twigs, leaves, rootlets and various vegetable fibres. The
eggs, which usually number four to six in the Indo-Malayan species,
measure approximately 25 x 18 mm. and, in Pitta guajana, are whitish
in colour with brown speckles.
Van den Bosch's Pitta is not the easiest of birds to manage in
captivity, as it needs warm, humid conditions which we are able to
provide in the Free Flight Bird Hall at the new Blackpool Zoological
Gardens.
Our pittas were released in the Bird Hall, which contains a mixed
collection, on the 5th July, 1972. The first nest was not started until
approximately six months later on the 17th December, 1972, a second
on the 29th December, 1972, and yet a third and a fourth on the
2nd January, 1973, and the 19th June, 1973, respectively. The first
three nests were not successful because they were too accessible to the
public and to the Bengalese, Silverbills, and Spice birds which took
squatters' rights and pushed out the pittas without a single beak being
opened in anger. One lesson to be learned from this is always to omit
from the collection these nest-building fanatics, if serious breeding of
more uncommon species is anticipated. All three nests were approxi-
mately 4 ft. from the ground, and built in the same manner as in
the wild.
The fourth nest was much more successful. It was built about the
same height from the ground as the three previous nests, but a new
area and a new type of plant, a seven foot cactus, was selected this
time. However, one thing it had in common with the three previous
nests was its vulnerability to the general public; the nest was only 2 ft.
from the main footpath and 4 ft. from the ground, which made it a
focal point to the interested, the ignorant, and the sadistic. My
assistant erected a thorn hedge beween the birds and the path, which
proved quite effective, and in this nest was laid the one and only egg.
The egg was incubated by both birds, which shared about equally the
total incubation period. After 16 days, the egg was tested and found
to be infertile. The same day I removed the nest from the cactus, but

the next morning, the birds started again in the same place. Having
decided that it was a waste of time for the birds to nest again in
this spot, I played a long shot. Whenever either of the birds came
with nesting material to the cactus, I sprayed it with a hosepipe.
After about one hour the birds finally started looking for a new site,
and to my delight they selected the top of a large tree, about 8 ft. high
in which I had provided a wire frame on which the birds could build.
They had completed the nest in two days and I felt that if we were
to succeed, this was our best chance. The first egg was laid on the
ist August, 1973, but owing to the female pitta not sitting, the egg
was destroyed by a Green-backed Wood Hoopoe. The following
day a second egg was laid, to which I added an old starling's egg,
hoping that with two eggs the birds would sit tight. This worked, and
the following day a third egg was laid. This completed the clutch,
and from then on the pittas were model parents.
Both birds again shared the incubation, which took only thirteen
days, and the two chicks hatched out on the 16th August, 1973. The
female spent most of the time with the chicks, while father searched
for suitable food for them. This consists mainly of earthworms, which
are broken up into small pieces about J in. long, and are fed by the
female to the young.
The chicks, when one day old, are blue-grey in colour, with grey
down. The latter is lost after three days, but the inside colour of the
mouth remains the same, a plain pale yellow. Whenever the male
brought food to the nest for the female to feed to the young, she gave
her mate the excreta, which he took and dropped approximately 30 ft.
from the nest. The chicks were surprisingly quiet.
At five days old, the wing feathers begin to show, and both parents
need to look for food as the appetites of the chicks grow. This
made the chicks vulnerable to the Green-backed Wood Hoopoe, and
to a pair of Kiskadee Flycatchers, which are also at liberty in the Bird
Hall. Because of the interest shown by these three birds in the
nest, I decided to keep a ready food supply of worms for the adult
pittas, not less than 30 ft. from the nest, so that the parent birds did
not have to go too far away. This worked so well that both birds
began to defend this area with great ferocity, putting to flight even a
pair of harmless Victoria Crowned Pigeons, and killing a Cordon Bleu.
By the 29th August, the wing and tail feathers had grown. The
chicks were very similar to a young Blackbird in colour, except that
they had the eye and wing stripe of the adult pitta.
As the days progressed, the appetites of the young birds grew, as
did the size of worm pieces brought by the parent birds. On the
31st August, the young pittas flew from the nest. At this moment we
decided that the young birds were attracting too much attention from
the much larger birds. This, combined with the large surface of deep

water, 15 in. at the deepest point, made us decide to put the young
pittas in a cage near to the nest, with bars wide enough apart to allow
the adults to feed them. Once more our luck held. Everything went
according to plan, and immediately the adult birds began to feed their
young.
On the 4th September the young birds started to feed themselves,
although the parents, especially the hen, still fed them on occasions.
The cock was eager to nest again and was looking for a new site; we
decided to remove the young from the Bird Hall into quarantine
quarters, so that we could watch over them.
In the quarantine quarters we housed the birds in a large box-cage
with a thick layer of damp peat on the bottom. Up to this time the
pittas had been reared almost entirely on earthworms, and they were
in first-class condition, so I tried to introduce a more varied range of
food consisting of fruit, softbill mixture, containing egg and meat, and
also mealworms. I also halved their earthworm supply and replaced
it with maggots.
This was our first mistake, because on the 35th dav from hatching
we lost one of the birds and very nearly lost both. It was the morning
after our local press had been to take some photographs. While the
photographer was setting up his camera, I noticed that the young
birds were a little quiet and that their eyes were not as round or bright
as before. The next morning one bird was near to death, and the
other was in a very serious condition. I noticed that the bird had
difficulty in passing the droppings and that they were white and green
and had the texture of elastic. Fortunately the surviving bird still had
an appetite, so acting as quickly as possible, I collected four or five
earthworms. I sprinkled them with Stevacin, the small grains stuck
to the worms, and one by one the young pitta ate them. The result
was more than I could have hoped for. Within six hours the wings
were no longer drooping, the feathers were tight and the eyes much
brighter. The following day the bird was back to normal and the
crisis was over.
During the three days that we had been so pre-occupied with the
young, the adult pair had built a new nest in a safe place and had
laid five eggs. We were able to time the interval between the laying of
two of the eggs as 27 hours.
When for the first time a new species is bred in captivity, a great
deal of luck is needed. In our case three main points were in our
favour: we had two healthy, compatible birds, an ideal environment,
and a good supply of worms. As for the five eggs in the new nest,
three hatched, so we were back to the beginning again, but this time
a little wiser on how to rear pittas.

Geotrygon chrysia
By Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
In his well-known book wild pigeons and doves, Jean Delacour
calls the Key-West Quail Dove "Golden Dove", thus paying well-
deserved tribute to its remarkably colourful plumage. It represents a
much more descriptive and appropriate designation than "Key-West
Quail Dove"; also in view of the fact that Key-West is known to have
been only its temporary habitation. Without exaggerating, I can testify
to the beauty of this dove, its plumage shining in full glory when I
photographed my breeding pair in sunshine in a glass-fronted cage.
The average breeder of this species has in all probability never come in
such close contact with this rare beauty. I purposely placed the cage in
a position where the rays of the sun would envelope the doves favour-
ably and completely for my purpose. They evoked patterns of shimmer-
ing green, brilliant purple, and flashing golden on crown, nape and
back.
Descriptions of this dove's behaviour in the wild are rather few.
A. G. Butler in Part II of foreign birds for gage and aviary quotes
Gundlach's beitrage zur ornitholgie gubas in part as follows : "The
habits of this Dove nearly resemble those of the Blue-headed Quail
Dove, preferring rocky and wooded regions. I scarcely ever met these
doves outside of the forest. In the densely timbered sections they may
be seen scratching among the leaves for food. They like to perch on
horizontal limbs, especially on limbs of zacsas.
"Its rather doleful call-note resembles the syllables 'hu-up'. The
nest, consisting of a slight platform of sticks, is usually placed on the
top crown of certain parasitic creepers found in the more open but
shady primitive forests. The eggs are two in number, of a pale ochre
colour, and measure 31.5 by 24 millimetres. I found nests between the
months of February and July."
I obtained my original breeding pair, then two years old, in 1963.
Today, ten years later, they are still hale and hearty, occupying the
same individual aviary and the same nest-site. The site is a glass-
enclosed hanging box, which enables me to observe the pair's nesting
behaviour readily and, since these birds are not shy, at reasonably
close range. They build the usual fragile nest of a few sticks and
leaves, adding but little new material when initiating the annual
second or third clutch of eggs. The male alone gathers the sticks and
straws, then flies swiftly to the nest to drop them, one at a time, in front
of the sitting hen, who then picks them up promptly to arrange them
round about her. He presents his offerings to his mate with quivering
wings. Often he interrupts his labours to squeeze into the nest close

beside her, the pair at times sitting so together for hours. This same
and rather curious habit of occupying the nest together for long
periods which, incidentally, I have never observed in any of my domes-
tic pigeons, is indulged in also during and after incubation. Usually
it is the male which is reluctant to leave the nest.
As to be expected during these long years in my aviary, the pair
have become fairly gentle, though, as becomes a wild creature, not
truly tame. When I approach too closely, the male especially, becomes
agitated, warning with a short, sharp whirring note, at the same time
bobbing head and body up and down vigorously and quivering the
wings. Though sometimes called ground doves, my "Golden" Doves
spend but little time on the floor of their pen, since food and water
containers are set high up on a shelf where they are not easily soiled
and can be conveniently attended to.
During the first four years of the Key-West Doves' sojourn in my
aviary, they laid two buff-coloured eggs in each clutch which they
incubated from 12 to 14 days, varying slightly with the warmth of
the prevailing climate. Since then, they have laid but a single egg in
each clutch. This egg production has been continual--and quite re-
markable--through summer and winter, in all probability owing to
ample feeding and to our prevailing mild climate. Since the fifth year,
there have been frequent layings of infertile eggs. The intervals between
the layings are usually only ten or twelve days. Thus, taking into
account their year-round efforts, they have produced, and produce at
this present time, their tenth year in my aviary, a really large total of
eggs. Their mating behaviour is much like that of the Common Bronze-
wing Dove, the male bowing before his mate, with quivering wings
and raised, spread tail. This takes place on the ground as well as on
the perch.

elders, and usually they are fed--and fed very well--by the parents
for several weeks after leaving the nest. Moreover, they are tolerated
in and about the nest for many weeks after they have left it. Each
pair of young raised by my breeding pair has turned out to be a true
pair. However, other breeders of this species report a preponderance
of females among the offspring.

THE PINK-HEADED DUCK (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea)
IN THE WILD AND IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970116710526316" page_id="56470792"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent)
The Pink-headed Duck was first named Anas caryophyllacea and
later described by Dr. John Latham in 1790. In 1852 it was accorded
a genus of its own, * Rhodonessa , by H. G. L. Reichenbach.
About sixteen years ago the Bombay Natural History Society
endeavoured to obtain reliable information concerning the present
status of this duck : with this object in view the Society widely dis-
tributed coloured illustrations with particulars of the bird's known
range, etc. to forest and district officials, private hunting organisations,
individual sportsmen, members of the Society and other likely infor-
mers, but the conclusion reached was that it had indeed become
extinct. This duck had a very extensive range and it is just possible
that a few small colonies still exist in remote places. It is perhaps best
for the present to rely on the old Scottish verdict " Not Proven
Whenever a species declines or becomes greatly diminished the blame
is almost invariably laid on Man. In this case it may be true because
this duck was non-migratory and confined to India; any close season
was all too often ignored, with the result that it was shot all the year
round. In addition within living memory vast areas of swampy ground
have been drained and brought under cultivation, with more people
settling near the birds' haunts and constantly cutting reeds and grass.
During the past fifty or so years little or nothing new has been written
about this duck and authors have in the main relied on the writings of
others. I most certainly must be included in this category, as I have
no personal experience. It was never my good fortune to see a living
example of this unique duck, neither do I possess a skin, but I do have
two original water-colour paintings by A. de Paret (reproduced in the
Avicultural Magazine, 1926, L'Oiseau in 1927 and Aviculture
1931 vol. 2) and Roland Green; I have also a quite comprehensive
ornithological library. Hence I have to rely on the oft-repeated obser-
vations and descriptions of others.
F. A. Shillingford, 1880, a contributor to the Asian Sporting News-
paper and a correspondent of A. O. Hume, is responsible for most of
the basic information we possess about the Pink-headed Duck in the
wild state, and it is his writings that have been copied wholly or in
part by the great majority of others.

48 A. A. PRESTWIGH - THE PINK-HEADED DUCK
Characteristics
Since Dr. John Latham first described this duck, there have, of
course, been many descriptions both of museum and living specimens,
such information being found in any text-book on Indian ornithology.
To mention just a few : Salvadori 1895, Stuart Baker 1908, Frank
Finn 1915, Wright and Dewar 1925, Jean Delacour 1956 and James
Greenway 1958. Some authors, possibly those with museum experience,
are inclined to describe birds in minute detail; others give the briefest
essentials. I prefer one of the most recent descriptions, that of Jean
Delacour, mainly because he alone of all authors has had the unique
personal advantage of keeping this species in confinement:--
" This strange duck has a narrow bill, a long, very thin neck, fairly
long legs, a thick body and a short tail. The head is slightly tufted on
the occiput. The bill, head and neck of the male is rose pink, of a
bright but tender hue, except for a blackish line on the forehead and
a black band from the chin to the breast, broadening on the foreneck;
rest of the plumage brownish-black, the mantle, scapulars and breast
finely lined with pale pink; edge of wing pinkish-white; outer second-
aries pale fawn or salmon with white tips; tertiaries glossy chocolate-
brown. Iris orange; legs reddish-black.
The female is similar, but the pink on the head and neck is whitish,
dull and tinged with dusky, particularly deep on the crown, nape and
hind neck; no black line on the throat and foreneck; rest of the
plumage duller and less dark. Iris brownish-orange; legs brown
There is a fair degree of variation in the measurements, possibly due
partly to the fact that older writers worked in inches whereas more
recent ones use millimetres. Count Salvadori is about average for the
former: "Length about 24 in.; wing 10.5 in.; tail 4.25 m.; culmen
2.1 in.; tarsus 1.6 in.", and Stuart Baker (1929) for the latter : " Length
about 350 mm.; wing 250 mm. to 282 mm.; tail 106 mm. to 131 mm.;
tarsus about 40 mm.; culmen 50 mm. to 56 mm." Female similar in
size, but Delacour gives the wing as 250 mm. to 260 mm.
Young (immature) birds: " Head and neck pale rose-whitish colour,
with the top of the head, nape and hind neck brown; the whole
plumage lighter brown; the underparts pale dull brown, with the
edges of the feathers whitish " (Salvadori). Chick (in down) un-
described.
Weight: C.M. Inglis gives the weight of a pair shot in ? 1935 as
3 lbs. each ( c . 1360 gm.), but F. A. Shillingford gives the weight of
five males shot between 13th February and 28th June, 1880, in con-
secutive order, as (1) 2 lbs. 3 ozs. (13th Feb.); (2) 1 lb. 14 ozs.; (3) 2 lbs.;
(4) 1 lb. 13 ozs. and (5) 1 lb. 12 ozs. (28th June) ( c . 793-992 gm.)
It is possible that the considerable difference in the weights given by
these two authors can be attributed to the fact that Shillingford's birds

were shot just prior to and at the beginning of the breeding season--
with consequent loss of weight.
Eggs: In shape they are quite unlike those of any other duck. They
are very nearly spherical, dull white with a scarcely perceptible ivory
tinge. Allan Hume (1890) gives the measurements of five eggs sent to
him by Shillingford as: 1.82 x 1.7; 1.78 x 1.68; 1.8 x 1.62;
1.71 x 1.69 and 1.81 x 1.61.
Dillon Ripley says; "Average size of eggs from two different nests
c. 44 mm. x 41mm. Two very round ones measured c. 43 mm. x
42 mm.". Again with the majority of writers there is slight variation
in dimensions; some at least, must be based on Shillingford's original
measurements. Five to ten eggs are laid in a nest.
Distribution
The status of the Pink-headed Duck seems always to have been
shrouded in something akin to mystery. It is credited with a wide
distribution, but despite the assertions of several writers it does not
seem to have been common anywhere. Authors in the main go from
one extreme to another--from Latham's bald " India " to others who
seem anxious to list almost every locality in which it has been seen.
Perhaps the best, certainly the easiest, way is to copy Greenway who
has compounded Stuart Baker, 1908; Frank Finn, 1915, and John
Phillips, 1922 : " India, formerly in scattered localities from Bhutan
south and west to central Bihar, along the Ganges and south along
the coast to the vicinity of Madras. The centre of distribution or area
in which they were to be found most commonly was north of the
Ganges and west of the Brahmaputra including Purneah, Maldah,
Purnlia, Bhagalpur and Tirhoot ".

Few authors appear to have had any personal experience, relying
on the observations of others; consequently there is considerable repeti-
tion. The following may be taken as a summary : Secretive and shy,
they are seldom seen except by chance. They are said to be partial
to swamps and small ponds surrounded by tall grass and bushes.
Sometimes in cold weather they resort to rivers; otherwise they are
sedentary. The flight is powerful and fast. The beautiful pale rosy
tint of the under surface of the wings is very conspicuous during flight
and renders this duck very readily distinguishable even at some dis-
tance. It never perches or dives in ordinary circumstances and seldom
associates with other species. During cold weather--November to
March--it is usually seen in small companies, varying from six to
eight (possibly family parties) to as many as thirty. Naturally, in the
breeding season pairs only are to be seen.
Jean Delacour, presumably as the result of studying captive birds,
records : " The voice of the male is a wheezy whistle recalling that of

the Mallards, but lower and weaker. The female has a low quack.
The males display in company, again like Mallards, but much more
simply; they puff out the short head feathers with the neck shortened
and resting on the back, then stretch the neck upwards and utter their
call. The females show in a rudimentary way the posture of the
dabbling ducks ".
The breeding season starts in April, they begin to build in May and
their eggs may be found in June and July. The nests are well formed,
made with dry grass interspersed with a few feathers and perfectly
circular in shape about 9 in. (c. 23 cm.) in diameter and four to five
inches ( c . 10 cm.-13 cm.) deep with three or four inch ( c . 7 cm-
10 cm.) walls and no special lining.
The nests are built in the centre of tufts of tall grass, well hidden
and difficult to find, generally not more than 500 yards from water.
It is not definitely known whether the male assists in incubation, but
judging from the loss of weight during the breeding season, recorded
by Shillingford, the male must be in constant attendance at the nest.
When the young are fledged in September-October the birds return
to their usual haunts in the jungly lagoons. The females are said to
indulge in injury-feigning to decoy would-be predators from the
vicinity of the young. It is a true surface-feeder in all its habits and is
said to feed on both vegetable and animal foods, remains of water
weeds and small shells having been found in the stomach. It is now
accepted that Rhodonessa is closely related to the Pochards (Aythyini).
... ;
Captivity
A well-known author-naturalist writing from India in 1901 said,
. . it has been not infrequently sent home ". If, indeed, any of these
ducks were sent, they very rarely reached Great Britain. It is doubtful
whether such ducks have, down the years, arrived alive on more than
half a dozen occasions in all.
Great Britain : The Zoological Society of London purchased the
first pair to arrive in Europe on 12th January 1874. They lived only
a few years. In 1887 A. Jamrach, the well-known dealer, imported
several pairs. They are said to have sold readily at from #40 to #60
a pair, surely a very high price at that time. Jamrach must have had
others later, for in my library there is an unique manuscript Collection
of Living Animals, Lilford 1878-1893 and in this Lord Lilford lists a
pair bought from Jamrach 19th April 1892. Wm. Cross of Liverpool
offered some in 1897. Then after several years of effort Alfred Ezra of
Foxwarren Park obtained five birds in 1925. A female arrived in July
and three males and a female on 10th August. These had been pro-
cured in Calcutta by Alfred Ezra's brother, Sir David Ezra. All
arrived in an excellent state, but one male died within a few days as
the result of an accident and another a month later from some infection

of the eyes. The remaining three were flourishing and looking wonder-
fully well in December 1926.
In the winter of 1929 ten more ducks arrived, mostly males. There
is a photograph in L'Oiseau 1930, facing p. 524; duplicated in Laidlay,
1933. Captain H. S. Stokes, 1933, says that the only female at Fox-
warren Park died during the winter of 1932.
Ezra, 1941, records that some of these ducks lived over ten years,
and although in perfect condition for several years and kept under
ideal conditions, they never attempted to nest. The skins of all the
Ezra birds were sent to various museums. It is a very great pity that
in view of this duck's possible extinction they were not more extensively
studied so as to provide detailed information on moult, behaviour, etc.
France : Jean Delacour says that in 1925 Alfred Ezra obtained three
pairs, one of which went to Cleres : in this I am afraid he is mistaken.
In 1929 two pairs of Ezra's second importation were received there.
Germany : Salim Ali, 1958-59 lists the 71 known skins in museums
and included is a male in the University Zoological Museum, Berlin,
marked "Died in the Zoo, Berlin, 1908 ". It is just possible that this
duck has been present in Germany in living memory, because H. A.
Fooks, 1947 writes: "The two Pink-headed Duck in the Gardens
(Calcutta) disappeared at about the same time that a distinguished
German Zoo proprietor was on a visit to Calcutta ".
U.S.A. : Delacour, 1956, says that one reached Darien (Connecticut)
in 1912.
India : At the beginning of the present century the Calcutta Zoo
usually exhibited two or three that always attracted considerable notice
and there were two fine adult males in the collection in 1923, the most
recently obtained was taken in 1919.
Once acclimatised, Pink-headed Ducks appear to have been hardy,
to have lived well, requiring no special care.
James Fisher and the Red Data Book both say that the last bird in
captivity died in 1944, but Peter Scott gives the date as about 1939
and this latter date is probably the more correct.
Salim Ali, i960, has been to very great trouble contacting the
principal ornithological collections in Europe, Asia and N. America
where specimens might be preserved. He succeeded in locating a total
of 71 skins in 15 collections, the oldest specimen being in the Paris
Museum dated 1825. Salim Ali is of the opinion that there might be
a few more skins in other public or private collections, making not
more than 80 skins in existence at the present time.
The Pink-headed Duck is now very scarce indeed; in fact some
authorities reluctantly consider that it is extinct. The last authentic
sight record was by C. M. Inglis in June 1935 in the Darbhanga
district, Bihar. During fairly recent years there have been several
sightings mainly by casual duck shooters, but it has been suggested that

By Robin L. Restall (Madrid, Spain)
It is unlikely that Cetti's Warbler will ever be very much in demand
as a cage or aviary bird. This is not a state of affairs that I am anxious
to change, but nonetheless it deserves to be commented upon. It is all
but ignored in the literature. Hubert Astley's contribution in avicul-
ture (Vol. i, 1925) was, " Cetti's Bush Warbler ... is resident on both
shores of the Mediterranean," this is followed by a brief description.
Unless there is something tucked away in an early Avicultural
Magazine that is about it! The ornithological literature has to be
more helpful, but not much. Bannerman, for example, does not men-
tion diet at all. I have quite a few books, collected over the years, and
the only one that really helps is the part-work published by IPG
during 1970-72 entitled Birds of the World. The entry for Getti's
Warbler is in volume 7, pages 2080, 2081. The notes on habitat, habits
and diet are excellent and provide much food for thought. Diet is
given as, " insects and their larvae, especially beetles and marshland
and aquatic species, but they also take small snails and worms and
some seeds, especially in winter when, indeed, these must sometimes
form the basic diet." Las Aves de Espana, published by Selecciones
del Readers' Digest, gives the following : " nest built by female alone in
April-May; clutch 3-5 eggs; incubation by female alone, 13 days;
nestlings are fed by the female alone and fledge in 15 days. Food :
insects, larvae, worms, molluscs and seed."
My bird journal for 16th January 1972 contains (more or less) the
following entry :
CETTI'S WARBLER. Saw a single bird in the cage of a softbill
dealer in the Rastro (Sunday morning market in Madrid), along with
some Robins. It was very weak and fluffed up, so weak in fact that one
foot had lost its power to grip and if the bird hopped up onto a perch
it would fall off. It was hopping around, fluffed up like a very cold
Robin, pecking at bits of food and dropping them. The dealer said,
" It wants to eat, but I have no worms and it won't take the food the
Robins eat." (His own home-made soft food.) The outcome of the
talk was that I was given the bird free since the fellow was convinced
that it was at death's door. Keeping it in the travelling box that I
bought it home in I gave it some mealworms. An hour later I hand
(force) fed a large fat mealworm and placed the bird in a suitable cage.
I supplied water well laced with antibiotics and multi-vitamin drops,
mealworms and softfood. I sat quietly in a corner and watched it take
a minute to beat a mealworm into submission, so I sorted out a dozen
or so very small mealworms to add to the bowl. By nightfall it had
recovered sufficiently to scold me with a couple of sharp chip, chip.

I kept this bird for a few months then, on a visit to England, took it
with me and gave it to Frank Meaden for a possible ASPEBA study
project. Despite frequent visits to the market throughout that year
I never saw another Cetti's Warbler, and Frank was unable to locate
anybody with the species in their collection. This bird died early in
1973, having lived for over a year in captivity, and remaining perfectly
healthy throughout.
In the Spring of 1973 I was offered a pair of Getti's Warblers and
gladly took them. I put them into a suitable cage with doctored
water, food and mealworms and left them to it. I was unable to look
at them that evening, but the next morning was horrified to find them
practically dead. They were too weak to feed, and obviously hadn't
eaten a thing the previous day--or since being trapped most probably,
so I decided to force feed. One bird died in my hands before I could
do anything and the other took a couple of beheaded fat mealworms.
When I left for the office 20 minutes later it looked decidedly better.
When I returned that evening it was dead.
A week later I saw the same dealer who, by a great coincidence,
had another pair of Cetti's Warblers. Recognising me he offered me
these birds, but on hearing my tale of woe thrust them upon me on an
only-pay-if-they-live basis. Reluctantly, I accepted. I am sorry to say
that the story is an almost identical repeat. This time I put on my
thinking cap for I was most upset, and very annoyed. Let me add
incidentally, before any reader concludes that I'm a total idiot, that
in my bird room I had at the time Reed Warblers, Willow Warblers,
Whitethroats, a Nightingale, Grey Wagtails and Bluethroats, and not
one had even looked shaky, let alone died. The (possible) answer did
not dawn on me until the autumn when I saw an odd Getti's Warbler
in a cage with some other birds.
I bought this odd bird and placed it in with the Reed Warblers.&apos;The
food consisted of a soft mixture, a bowl of mealworms, and a bowl of
wireworms and queen ants. I concluded that the two pairs of Cetti's
had not recognised the bowls of mealworms as food, and obviously the
softfood would be meaningless. The new bird must have seen the
Reed Warblers taking the mealworms and, being hungry, soon followed
suit. When the opportunity to buy a further bird a few weeks later
came along I bought it and simply put it in with the established
residents. Again I had no trouble. On thinking back I reckoned that
maybe the first warbler in the Robins' cage had learned to recognise
food source, but hadn't liked the food until it tasted my mealworms.
Those seven Getti's Warblers are the only ones that I have ever seen
on offer anywhere. My last pair are still fit and well and are taking
soft food mixed with ground ox heart and grated cheese, plus maggots
and mealworms (both well powdered with Squibb's Vionate). They are
also offered mealworm beetles and larvae, and get the odd handful of

creepy-crawlies that turn up under the compost heap. This diet is
identical to that provided by Frank Meaden.
An alternative hypothesis has presented itself as a result of rejecting
the obvious and attempting to analyse natural behaviour patterns. The
Getti's Warblers that have survived with me have been caught in the
autumn. At this time of the year the birds have a totally different
behaviour pattern, for they are bold, fly across the path of the intruder
freely, and sing with vigour and willingness. It may be that at this
time of the year these sedentary and resident birds are establishing
their winter territories. Also, with change of food supplies, fewer free-
flying insects, increase in berries, increase in dry seed, that they are
going through an " open-diet " phase.
By contrast, in Spring they are extremely secretive and shy and are
very difficult to catch sight of. The characteristic explosive song is as
easy to hear as in the autumn, but not to locate. Also in the Spring,
with breeding, feeding, and dense insect populations they are un-
doubtedly more insectivorous, if not totally so. They may also be more
highly strung, and sensitive. My guess is that physiologically the species
is more able to adapt to life in captivity in the autumn than in the
Spring.
This is probably true of a lot of species of birds, but maybe notice-
ably more so with the Getti's Warbler. I am rather shy of asking for
information from readers, as I know from experience on a number of
occasions that responses are always poor. Nevertheless I would like to
end this with a plea to anyone who has ever kept this species, or who
has observed it in captivity to please inform the Editor. I suspect that
diet may prove to be all important, as with so many species, but it
could be that other factors assume an equal importance.
I began by stating the opinion that it is unlikely that Cetti's Warbler
will ever be very much in demand as a cage or aviary bird. I believe
this because it (a) lacks a decorative song, (b) lacks bright or pretty
colours, (c) is very retiring, positively skulking in fact, (d) appears to
present difficulties when newly obtained, (e) may well be difficult to
maintain in good condition, or get over the moult, (f) does not interest
the trappers or the dealers. Nonetheless it is a lovely and very interest-
ing bird. My own success rate of three out of seven is a ratio that
deserves to be forgotten, and not repeated. If more information on the
species can be collected maybe the odds will be improved tremendously.

Rhyncopsitta pachyrhyncha
By K. W. Dolton (Shoulton, Hallow, Worcester)
In 1966 Mr. Alfredo Marques very kindly gave me a Thick-billed
Parrot that he had deposited at London Zoo and which, I understand,
was the only one of the species in the country at that time. In Decem-
ber of the same year I obtained a pair that had been imported from
Mexico and a further pair in 1968.
These birds were housed together in an outdoor aviary and in
addition to seeds, nuts and fruit, I gave them raw mutton obtained
from a pet shop. In the winter of 1969 three died from liver fluke
(Trematoda) of the same species, Fasciola hepatica, as that affecting
sheep. The bodies were examined at the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries laboratory in Worcester and the flukes identified by Mr.
Shaw who was surprised that the birds should have died from this
cause, for birds are generally resistant to such flukes.
After this I continued to give the mutton, but this was obtained
from a butcher, though for the past two years the parrots have not
received any meat.
In the spring of 1970 I obtained two more pairs of Thick-billed
Parrots and all were divided up into pairs which occupied separate
aviaries, each aviary measuring 12 feet long by three feet wide with
a three foot cube shelter at one end. One hen laid an egg on the
shelter floor, but next day it had disappeared, presumably eaten, and
this pair has shown no sign of breeding intention since.
In the flight of each aviary is a grandfather clock type of nesting
box and on September 9th, 1973, I was surprised to hear the sound
of a nestling being fed in one of them. This chick was then about two
weeks old : the parents fed it on hemp and sunflower seeds soaked
in water, peanuts and apple which they would only eat if it was
pushed through the wire-netting, not if put in a dish. On the 4th
November the young one left the nest, being then about three-parts ;
grown. It was green except for a band of red on the forehead and
yellow under the wings. I shut the young bird into the shelter at
night for the next three weeks, but it now roosts there of its own
accord. All the time the chick was in the nest the parents slept with it,
but as soon as it left they went back to roosting in the shelter.

By T. E. Bowes (Norton- j uxta-Twycross, Atherstone, Warwickshire)
The Cayenne or Grey-necked Wood Rail ranges from Mexico to
Argentina and its habitat includes marshy places and dense under-
growth of forests up to an altitude of 900 metres. This species measures
some 37 cm. in length and the sexes are alike in appearance except
that the female is the larger. The head, neck and chest are ash-grey;
breast and flanks reddish-brown; centre of abdomen black; feathers
around the abdomen white; lower back, tail-coverts and tail black;
mantle and wings olive; flight feathers chestnut; irides pink; bill
brownish-yellow at the base and green at the tip; legs and feet coral,
these main colours differing slightly in the various subspecies. Our
pair at the East Midland Zoological Society's Twycross Zoo are
believed to be Ar amides cajanea pacifica which is restricted to Hon-
duras and Nicaragua.
They are housed in our free-flight aviary with crowned pigeons,
Scarlet Ibises, Vulturine Guineafowl, White-cheeked Turacos, various
doves, mousebirds (colies), cardinals, weavers and whydahs. The aviary
is well planted with conifers and various deciduous trees; there are
two quite large pools, one supplied by a waterfall.
Naturally, a wide variety of food is offered to the inmates--chopped
apple, banana, grapes and tomato in six shallow dishes; a mixture of
minced meat (including heart), fish, layers' (poultry) mash, grass meal
and a carotenoid preparation in two other dishes and mixtures of
seeds and corn together with live maggots are also given. The rails
appear to eat mainly the meat and fish mixture and maggots.
During the winter of 1972-73 the birds were shut at night into a shed
together with the ibises and crowned pigeons, this place being heated
with infra-red lamps. Next to this shed is a small tool-shed which the
rails often visited, going in and out through a hole in the door and
it was here that they chose a nesting place, building the nest on some
empty grain sacks at about the middle of April, 1973.
The nest had been completed some eight or ten days before the
first egg was laid. It was cream in colour, spotted and blotched with
red-brown and purple and on each of the next four days another egg
was laid, incubation beginning with the laying of the last. The birds
were given as much privacy as possible and on the 25th day the eggs
hatched. It soon became apparent that four of the chicks were weakly
--in fact by the evening of the first day only one was surviving. The
parents were busy all day long catching flies for this ever open mouth :
the fly was first stunned or killed by being knocked against some hard
object and then offered to the chick which would greedily take it

from the tip of the parent's bill. When hatched the young one was
about the size of a newly hatched Coot; its body was covered with
predominantly black down, but with some patches of very dark chest-
nut; the legs and feet were black. The parents nested again at the end
of July, another clutch of five being laid at intervals of one day and
it appeared that both parents took part in incubation, the father at
night and the mother through the day. Once again after a period of
25 days the eggs hatched and the diet of the chicks, as before, was
made up of flies caught by the parents, no other food being eaten by
them, though the adults continued with their normal diet.
By the time the second clutch had hatched the young one from the
first nest was in the juvenile plumage which resembled that of the
adults except that the colours were not so vivid and the legs and feet
were still black. A week later the weather became a little colder and
this had an effect on the numbers of flies about the aviary, so, as the
chicks were still dependent on them, the food situation became serious.
Flies were caught by us and put into jars so that the birds could
more easily catch them before they escaped, but the parent birds
would not go near the jars and by the time the weather became warm
again, only two of the brood had survived. The chicks did not begin
to eat maggots until about three weeks of age and meat was taken
about two weeks later. Until the chicks were about eight weeks old
the parents were very protective and even birds three times their size
were attacked if they came near.
At the time of writing the eldest chick is over seven months old
and appears to be in the full adult plumage, but still not as brightly
coloured as the parents. The younger ones at over four months have
just moulted into the adult plumage and it would seem that the
colours deepen with each moult--the parents appear to get more
richly coloured with age. This winter (1973-4) a heating lamp has
been put in the tool-shed where the rails all roost. The parents are
still protective of their young, but it will be interesting to see if they
tolerate them when the next breeding season comes.
No record of previous successful breeding of his species in Britain
has been found. The first success seems to have taken place in 1868
at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Paris, and the San Diego, Detroit,
Cologne and Frankfurt Zoos have published accounts of breeding
this species in their gardens.
As described, the Cayenne or Grey-necked Wood Rail Aramides
cajanea has been bred at Twycross Zoo, and this is believed to be a
first success. Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding
of this species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to
inform the Secretary, Editor or Assistant Editor at once.

By N. A. Wood
(Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucester)
Nematodes (roundworms) are elongated, unsegmented worms with
attenuated anterior and posterior ends and a tough, noncellular
covering known as the cuticle. They are mainly parasites of the
intestinal tract, but some species inhabit the eyes, windpipe, air sacs,
lungs, heart and body cavity of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals. Unlike tapeworms (where both sexual organs are present
in the same animal) nematodes are usually either male or female.
One nematode, Acuaria (Echinuria) uncinata, is a not infrequent
parasite of waterfowl, where it may stunt growth and cause death,
especially in young birds. Its status in wild duck is relatively little
known, although Connell (in Cornwell, 1963) has shown that it can
be an important and extensive source of mortality to wild ducklings in
Canada. In captivity, it may account for a small number of deaths, or
reach epidemic proportions like the outbreak described by Buxton
et al. (1952) in which 85% of a flock of 250 ducks died within a period
of eight weeks. Since almost all waterfowl seem to be susceptible,
special care needs to be taken by those with captive collections of
ducks, geese and swans, or those planning waterfowl parks. The
following account reviews the situation at Slimbridge, where 100 cases
of Acuaria have been confirmed during the last 12 years. As this
constitutes only 1-2% of deaths, the disease can be said to be fairly
uncommon at the Wildfowl Trust. Other aviculturists may, neverthe-
less, be interested in our findings.

In birds, the stomach is divided into two parts, the proventriculus
and the gizzard. Post mortem examinations of waterfowl infected with
Acuaria show that the worms burrow deeply (using their anterior
ends) into the lining of the proventriculus, and form tumour-like
growths. The posterior end protrudes into the cavity of the proven-
triculus, and this, in the female, facilitates egg laying. If heavily
parasitised, and up to 2000 worms in a single bird have been reported
(Cornwell, 1963), the host's tissue reaction may be so severe that the
swelling blocks the passage to the gizzard and the bird starves to
death.

Table i shows all cases of Acuaria recorded at Slimbridge between
1962 and 1973. During that time, no cases were observed in flamingos
or in screamers, Magpie Geese, shelducks, eiders and stiff tails
(Oxyurini). Acuaria was only rarely found in the whistling ducks,
true geese (Anser and Branta) and sheldgeese, although these are well
represented in the collection at Slimbridge. In contrast, it was common
in the swans, the perching ducks (Cairinini) and, proportional to the
small number kept, also in the Harlequin Duck. Table 2 shows the
incidence in some of these apparently susceptible species, where six
or more birds were involved.

It is clear that the Carolina is no more susceptible than other
perching ducks--the number of cases appears high merely because
a large number are examined. Strangely, Acuaria was not recorded
in the Mandarins, although these ducks are almost as common at
Slimbridge as the Carolinas, to which they are apparently related.
That young swans are more susceptible than adults is obvious (see also
Cornwell 1963). This may be a question of the absolute size of the
proventriculus (a small one is presumably severely damaged by only
a few worms), or may reflect a difference in feeding habit--the cygnets
filtering the surface water for insects and duckweed, while the adults
take vegetation and grain. Acuaria may even be quite common in
some wild Mute Swan populations in Britain, where stunting and
death of cygnets are frequently reported.
Waterfowl that have not been affected perhaps do not normally
filter the top layers of the water, and so avoid any Daphnia (scream-
ers, Magpie Geese, eiders and stiff tails) or are genuinely immune
(flamingos). Other workers have reported cases in young Mandarins,
shelducks, eiders and stifftails (Venn 1954, Cornwell 1963, McDonald
1969), so these species cannot be considered totally resistant.
The youngest bird to die at Slimbridge from the effects of Acuaria
was a Hartlaub's duckling aged 12 days. Several others died at 14
days old. On the other hand, many juveniles were fully feathered when
they succumbed. The exact age of many mature birds was not known,
but several were 2-4 years old suggesting that adults never achieve

immunity.
Few deaths associated with Acuaria were recorded in the first half
of the year; in fact only eight individuals of eight susceptible species
died between January and July, while a peak occurred between August
and October. This is shown in Figure i, which in addition to the
species in Table 2, also includes the Ringed Teal, the White-winged
Wood Duck and the Harlequin. The Daphnia population in Great
Britain is often largest from about early July, shortly after the peak
hatching time for most waterfowl. This presumably explains the in-
creased number of infected birds in the latter half of the year.

It is probably easier to ensure that there are no Daphnia than to
be certain they are free of infection. Daphnia has but slight ability
to move against the water flow and lives mainly in stagnant ponds and
lakes where there is little or no current. It prefers the edge and surface
of ponds where, in summer, the water is warmer. Increasing the flow
through the waterfowl collection, and making sure there are no stag-
nant backwaters, should reduce the numbers of Daphnia. Precautions
are particularly necessary during the late summer months and on the
rearing grounds. The Wildfowl Trust has had considerable success in

reducing Acuaria infestations in young birds by increasing the water
flow through the duckery. Before this was done, in 1952 and 1953
alone, there were 65 cases of Acuaria (Venn 1954) and this accounted
for 35% of deaths in the collection. All the young listed in Table 2
as dying of the disease since 1962 were being reared elsewhere in the
grounds, usually by their parents.
Healthy Daphnia are a useful food for ducklings, for example
Pink-eared ducklings ( Malacorhynchus membranaceus ) reportedly feed
on little else (T. Spence pers.com.). Nevertheless, water fleas must be
fed to captive ducklings with caution. One should also beware of
bringing in duckweed ( Lemna ) from really stagnant ponds. If wild
waterfowl are present at these places, there is the added danger of
introducing other parasites, such as tapeworms, since the secondary
hosts of these also commonly live among the weed. It is, however,
unlikely that wild birds other than waterfowl contract Acuaria uncinata
and, therefore, not to be expected that the parasite will be introduced
into a collection by Coots, Moorhens, Herons, gulls and similar avian
visitors.

TREATMENT OF AFFECTED BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999718615384615" page_id="56470808"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
It can only be stated that there is no easy and reliable treatment
yet available and more research is needed before any definite course
of treatment can be recommended. Although a number of different
substances have been tried by various workers, the results have been
inconclusive or even contradictory. However, when valuable birds,
like young Bewick's Swans, are affected by this parasite, attempts at
treatment still seem worth making.
Gibson and Barnes (1957) treated eight domestic goslings aged 14
weeks, with a 1 ml. capsule of carbon tetrachloride. Two died within
a week but the condition of the remainder very slowly improved. As
ho untreated control group was available, the value of carbon tetra-
chloride remains unassessed. Further, Kovalenko and Kalcmenko
(1966), who used the larger dose of 2 ml. per kilogram body weight,
found it of little value, a similar result to that found by Guilmon et al.
(1971). The latter study also showed that thiophenylamine, ethylene
tetrachloride, methyridine and thiabendazole were ineffective.
More satisfactory results were found by Mineev (1969) who, after
artificially infecting ducklings, suggested the following treatments (or
more correctly prophylaxis) :
Potassium permanganate 2.5 to 5 mg. per kg. (body weight)
Sulphathiazole 60 to 120 mg. per kg.
Piperazine dithiocarbamate 20 to 40 mg. per kg.
Formalin 0.5 to 1.0 mg. per kg.
The birds were given these treatments for a period of 50 days, and
then the degree of protection achieved was considered by examining
the number of lesions and by comparing the weight gains with those

of untreated controls.
Grafner et al. (1967), and Kovalenko and Kalchenko (1966) agreed
that Phenothiazine at 0.4 g. per kilogram in the food for three to four
weeks gives satisfactory results.
Tetramisole (I.C.I. : "Nilverm"; Jansen Pharmaceutica: "Apper-
col") has been used at Slimbridge, with varying degrees of success,
at the rate of 1 ml. per kg. body weight, as single doses by the mouth.
As with all the antihelminthics mentioned in this review, repeated
weekly or twice weekly doses over three to four weeks gave the most
satisfactory results. Seneviratna (1969) has recommended Tetramisole
at 0.04 per cent in the drinking water for one day for intestinal round-
worms in poultry. This procedure, on a repeated basis, might also be
tried, provided that access to other water is prevented.
Anyone attempting these treatments, if unfamiliar with the method
of drenching livestock for worms or unable to accurately measure or
weigh the required dosage, is strongly advised to seek advice from a
Veterinary Surgeon or someone familiar with the procedure.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime, France)
I was in Northern California from November 27th until December
4th, 1973, on the occasion of the annual meeting of the International
Wild Waterfowl Association. We had met in France, Belgium and
England in 1972. Under the care of our Vice-President, Mr. Ed.
FitzSimmons, our 1973 meeting was, needless to say, an excellent one
--San Francisco is always a perfect headquarters, and a visit to the
National Waterfowl Refuge at Willows, north of Sacramento, con-
stituted a particularly exciting excursion. I was there for the first time
fifty years ago, in the company of the late James Moffitt, a great
expert on Californian waterfowl. The vast sanctuary was then full of
wintering geese--Snow, White-fronted and Cackling, as it still is today,
but there were also thousands of Taverner's Canadas which, at present,
no longer stay there for some unknown reason. One also sees a small
number of the large Canada Goose ( moffitti) as well as a fair popula-
tion of the large Tule White-fronted. These very big geese, still
scientifically unnamed, keep to a small area of the refuge and do not
mix with the others. Their northern breeding grounds have yet to
be discovered. These birds are considerably larger, with longer necks
and bills, than the dark Anser alhifrons gambelli which winters in
Texas.
I had a couple of days after the meeting to visit some old friends'
aviaries north of San Francisco where pheasants, pigeons and doves
have been successfully reared for many years. We went one day to
Sonoma where Mr. A. Sebastiani keeps a large collection of waterfowl
and doves in the middle of his vineyards--his vinery is one of the
oldest and best in California and it retains an old world atmosphere.
His aviaries are numerous, his collection extensive and his success
great. Another day, his son-in-law, Mr. Cuneo, himself a bird amateur,
took me to see other collections, including that of Mr. J. W. Steinbeck
(at Danville near Mt. Diablo) for many years the best and most con-
sistent breeder of pigeons and doves in the country. I remember
visiting him at Concord almost fifty years ago and obtaining rare
species from him. He moved later to a new location and the present
one is his third, for he moved as the neighbourhoods became gradually
more and more built up--but all his successive installations looked
very much the same. They consist of a walnut orchard with a house
near the entrance and a large series of roomy aviaries, fan-shaped, on
the opposite side of the grounds. Each compartment is planted and
has a deep shelter at the back and, being contiguous, these shelters
form a closed wall around the orchard which is thus free from
draughts. Besides a very large and varied collection of doves, Mr.

Steinbeck also breeds a few rare pheasants such as tragopans, monals
and peacock pheasants; finches and a few parrots. Crowned cranes and
a few other large birds live free in the orchard. It is all well kept and
a pleasing scene where each year very many young birds are reared.
Each aviary contains a pair of game birds and crowned pigeons and
from ten to twenty pairs of various doves which nest successfully in
baskets and boxes fixed along the walls of the shelters and on the
branches of the trees. Among the rarest species bred in 1973 I noticed
the young of Satyr Tragopans, Grey and Palawan Peacock Pheasants,
three species of crowned pigeon, Nicobar, Partridge Bronze-winged
P.scripta, many Plumed Doves, P.plumifera , and some of the very rare
Australian Flock Pigeon, P.histrionica. It is always interesting and
instructive to visit Mr. Steinbeck's establishment and to recall memories
of bygone avicultural achievements, for he has been so successful for
so many years.
We also called on Mr. Blankenship who lives in the neighbourhood
and who is another old dove amateur; we then went to see the remark-
able collection of Mr. V. Denton at Liverpool who keeps and breeds
there, in partnership with Mr. FitzSimmons, some of the rarest species
of pheasant. Only the most valuable ones are represented, but often
in great numbers--Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans, Bornean and
Malay Argus, Bornean Fireback, various jungle fowl, Bulwer's, Ijima,
Mikado and White Eared Pheasants and an amazing and complete
series of the peacock pheasants {Polypiectron). There are numbers of
Grey and Palawan, unfortunately only odd specimens of Malay,
Bronze-tailed and Rothschild's and a few Germain's, but I saw there
three males, one female and one young of the extremely rare Bornean
Peacock Pheasant, a very scarce bird on that island, for fewer than a
dozen specimens are preserved in the great museums of the world.
There are also hybrids between it and the Malay, a close relative and
only subspecifically different. One of the four pairs of Bulwer's had
laid, but the eggs proved infertile; this seems to be the first clutch
ever produced in captivity, as specimens at Cleres and elsewhere before
the last war had never nested. The climate of Livermore, fairly mild
in the winter and hot summers, suits the tropical species very well, but
it has proved too warm for pheasants from the high mountains. Here
there are also a number of parrakeets, particularly yellow and blue
Ring-necked, and a few other birds.
On our return to San Francisco we went to see Mr. A. Thierry at
Oakland. I remember him as a young man, which he no longer is,
but he is still a very successful pheasant breeder. Being near the ocean
the climate here is equable and cool in summer so that it suits the
tragopans and crossoptilons, while it is warm enough in winter for the
argus and firebacks. I noticed a dozen young Temminck's among
many others such as argus, different firebacked and peacock pheasants.

By R. T. Kyme (Kirton, Lincolnshire)
I received a pair of Azara's Conures from my good friend Alan
Coupland who has also been most helpful in assisting in the building
of my bungalow, birdroom and aviaries.
Azara's Conure is mainly green, with the forehead maroon and
crown dark green, the feathers of the nape light-edged, and the eye
surrounded by a prominent circle of white skin. The ear-coverts are
lighter buffish-brown, the cheeks dark green, and the sides of the neck
and the upper breast are scaled in appearance, being olive with yellow
edges on the breast, and tipped with whitish-yellow on the sides of the
neck. There is an irregular maroon patch on the breast, the upper parts
are dark green and the flight feathers bluish. The bill is black and the
bird is about 11 ins. long. In the wild it occurs in northern Argentina
and Paraguay.
My birds were placed in an aviary 7 six feet square, with a two-foot
asbestos shelter. The cock bird is quite tame and the pair were seen
mating on numerous occasions. They were fed on sunflower seed and
hemp; they relish sweet apple and spinach beet, especially the former.
Their nest was a natural log which they visited as soon as it was
placed in the flight. Four eggs were laid, white and about the size of
those of the Red-rumped Parrakeet. The first egg hatched on 22 nd
July, and the remaining ones hatched on alternate days.
The chicks left the log on the 7th, 9th, nth and 13th September.
The young were like the adults except that they have shorter tails.
The adults are now, in October, mating again, so perhaps they will
have a second brood.

The bird collection here has continued to show a steady improve-
ment in all aspects : initially several broad objectives were set for its
future development. These include : representing as wide a range of
birds, on a family level, as possible; emphasizing their diversity and
ecological adaptations; reduction in numbers of common species and
elimination of domestic forms; specializing in rarer and lesser known
representatives of the various families with a view to learning more
of their management, ethology and biology; preservation through
propagation of the foreign species that are rare or declining in
Australia and emphasizing habitat exhibits of mixed compatible species
that are normally sympatric.
Because of the complete bird import ban in Australia, initiated in
1948, many species foreign to Australia are impossible to obtain or
are very rare in the country. On the other hand, there are approxi-
mately 385 species that are endemic to Australia, and over 700 that
are known to occur here, although several of these are very sporadic,
particularly the waders and sea-birds. Most Australian species are
protected by law in the six states and the Northern Territory : each
state is quite independent and the laws vary considerably between
them. In some, permits may be obtained for the zoo to collect birds;
in others, not.
Bird dealers in Australia offer primarily c the more common parrot
species, finches (as well as some foreign finches), a few quail and the
commoner pigeons. Aside from those species which reproduce readily
in aviaries, native birds are seldom available from dealers and if a
representative collection is to be assembled for the zoo, they must be
trapped personally. Fortunately the zoo has a good relationship with
the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Department, and was granted
a permit to trap a limited number of individuals for the collection.
This does not extend to other states, however, and therefore the birds
collected are from New South Wales.
Our last bird inventory, on 30th June, 1973, reveals a total of
around 2,000 birds of 311 species, representing 23 orders and 69
families. The following might be of interest to aviculturists : one pair

BIRDS OF PARADISE IN CAPTIVITY; A MAJOR
MORAL PROBLEM

By C. B. Frith (Walton-on-Thames, Surrey)
I have for a number of years been concerned with the study of the
birds in the Australasian area, and in particular with the birds of
paradise (Paradisaeidae). As a keeper at Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney,
I cared for the then large collection of birds of paradise and have
made use of captive populations in England for observations (Frith,
AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE, vol. 74 : 85-90). I believe in, and
support, aviculture in both practice and principle and my aim in
writing the following is not to criticize it in any derogatory fashion
but simply to point out what I consider urgent and important facts.
During recent years an increasing number of live birds of paradise
have been reaching the bird markets of Asia and continental Europe,
and thence to Britain and America. The vast majority of these birds
are illegally exported, being fully protected by wise conservation laws
in their native Papua New Guinea, West Irian and Australia. Possibly
the populations of a number of species are little affected by such
exploitation, having in recent years been somewhat relieved from the
pressure upon them of hunting by natives. In many other species,
however, the situation must be made worse by exportation of live
birds in view of the fact that, for the live bird market, hunting is not
restricted to adult males but includes the females and immature males.
The fact that people in Europe and America are prepared to pay
vast sums for birds of paradise reflects that they greatly appreciate
and admire them. By virtue of this one imagines that these people
would wish such birds to flourish in the wild. Do they realize, I wonder,
the terrible implications involved in simply parting with their however
many hundreds of pounds for such a bird? With every sale of a bird
of paradise the illegal exporter rubs his hands and laughs as the
market demand rises; in go more collectors and out come more birds.
The enjoyment of seeing these live birds in this and other countries
could bring about the extinction of them in the wild. This would be
more likely in the case of some species than in others I admit. Take
for example Wilson's Bird of Paradise Diphyllodes res public a, several
of which I have recently observed in England. This ornate bird is
confined to the hilly interior of two islands off western New Guinea.
The Red Bird of Paradise Paradisaea rubra is also confined to these
two islands and one, or possibly two more where it is found in the
lowland forests only. Many other species are very restricted in range
and the live bird trade is not the only pressure upon them. Some
species, such as the Blue Bird of Paradise Paradisaea rudolphi are
suffering from habitat destruction and in addition are still being taken
by native peoples for the splendid plumes.

It must be noted that the majority of birds of paradise are poly-
gynous and the reproduction of the species is, therefore, dependent
upon a relatively small number of males in the population at any one
time. Obviously it is these fully plumaged males that are most con-
spicuous and more easily trapped by the natives for the illegal export
trade. This situation must have a seriously detrimental effect upon
the populations if the trade remains constant and in the case of some
of the island isolated species it could bring about local or complete
extinction.
I, least of all, would not deny that captive birds of paradise are of
value in gaining a greater understanding of them. To emphasise this
point a list of publications resulting directly from captive birds is given
below. It is noted, however, that most of these have been produced
by the staff of large zoological institutions. New data, and breedings,
from captive birds of paradise represent success from an infinitesimally
small percentage of birds exported from the country of origin and/or
kept in captivity.

Most birds of paradise are relatively easy to keep in captivity but
are not so easy to breed. Most of them are polygynous and the presence
of a male and female continuously in one area is an unnatural one.
The fact that immature males are (for several years) identical in
plumage to females means that much time may pass before the sex
of a female coloured bird is assured after its arrival in a collection.
Naturally in cases where a supposed female turns out to be a male,
two cock birds have been removed from the wild, polygynous, society
and have in most cases been denied their reproductive potential as few
people (or zoos) could afford to instantly obtain a mate even if one
should be available.
Obviously figures for illegally exported birds of paradise are not
available but some indication of the kind of legal trafficking supported
by avicultural demand can be gained from Mr. Martin's paper on the
trade in Thailand, published in a recent issue of this magazine. Mr.
W. H. Timmis, Curator of birds and mammals at Chester Zoo, has
recently returned from a three month trip to Indonesia. He tells me
of seeing cages containing possibly hundreds of live birds of paradise
in the bird markets of Singapore and Bangkok. In addition he told
me of shops and markets at various localities in Indonesia where cases
of birds of paradise (and various other colourful groups) skins were
offered for sale to tourists. Obviously the birds of paradise are
suffering considerable predation by mankind at present. The effect
of this activity cannot be accurately judged and, as in other historical
cases, it may be realised too late.
The Paradisaeidae is by no means the only group in which several

species are possibly endangered by the innocent and laudable appre-
ciation of aviculturists. Our appreciation can, however, be harmful
when carried as far as wanting such groups or species in our cages.
With his kind permission I quote an applicable paragraph of Mr.
Martin's ( loc . cit.) changing only the first word from "Figures" to
Facts.
"Facts such as these must concern even the most hardened avicul-
turist. Clearly we have a lot of work to do if aviculture (the foreign-
bird branch) is to remain a respectable occupation. It is my personal
opinion that there has got to be changes, and many foreign-bird en-
thusiasts are going to have to try a lot harder to breed their own
stock replacements--for that is surely our responsibility. We cannot
continue to be consumers of nature in this wholesale manner. Avicul-
ture, for its own good, must change with the times." These wise words
are simply fact. If demand for a species becomes greater than the
reproductive rate, the bird is doomed to extinction. As it is, any
predation upon bird populations by man other possibly than for food
(cases such as primitive natives taking plumes accepted as debatable)
can be considered unnatural.
What form then should such changes take? Firstly let me stress
the point made by Mr. Martin; that WE should make the changes
and change with the times. It is OUR responsibility and business to
know our limitations. Aviculture should not wait for directives from
the conservational bodies and legislation, but should express the deep
concern most of its practitioners have for rare and endangered
avifaunas with recommendations of its own.
Obviously there is need for captive populations of rare species as
illustrated by the studies and breeding successes of the Wildfowl Trust
and others. I do not personally want to see the importation of, say,
the birds of paradise completely stop, but I do want to see control.
Control brought about by the sense of responsibility and actions of
the members of the Avicultural Society and similar bodies.
In his message of congratulation to our magazine on the occasion
of its 75th anniversary (vol. 75 .*228) Walter Van den bergh wrote
of it, "Most important is the contribution that this journal has con-
sistently made towards the preservation of certain species of birds
which without support would have already become extinct." One of
our more important aims is still to preserve such "certain species",
and in some cases this aim can be better reached by quelling our
enthusiasm to keep the species in our aviaries. The body of experienced
and skilful aviculturists forming the Avicultural Society and their
ornithological associates should be able to decide which species has
a better chance of maintaining itself in the wild and which is adaptable
enough to be assisted in captivity.
As a member of the Society I would like to ask the Council and

members to consider the formation of a "rare and endangered list"
committee consisting of members and consultants. I would suggest
the initial function of such a committee be to draw up a list of bird
species considered to be too rare in the wild to be freely kept in
captivity without an examination of the specific circumstances and
conditions under which they are retained. Obviously the initial powers
of such a group would be purely advisory but, as in all legislative
matters, such things gain support and momentum if justly founded.
Far better be it for aviculturists to bring about legislation of their
own origin than to be dictated to by other bodies with possibly less
knowledge or understanding of the situation. The sort of final aim I
personally imagine is that the keeping of very rare or endangered
species be restricted to persons or institutions with adequate conditions
for breeding as judged by the Society's committee. Such privileged
parties should undertake to record and make available as much in-
formation as possible on the captive birds. I would like to see bird of
paradise keeping confined to places where perfect conditions, relatively
unlimited funds and qualified specialists are available.
I sincerely believe that the birds concerned will benefit and avicul-
turists will gain far more success if the latter were to act as one and
bring about some control on the keeping of endangered species. The
market for rare birds will be dried up until the collectors have to limit
their trade to the less endangered, but no less interesting, species.
This surely is a state of affairs all aviculturists would wish to bring
about.

What appears to be a major advance in duck-rearing technique
is embodied in the new centre completed and in operation last June
at the Wildfowl Trust's headquarters, Slimbridge. Hygiene was the
paramount consideration in the design of this building, special at-
tention being paid to surfaces where Aspergillus spores might lodge.
The room temperature is thermostatically controlled and extractor
fans ensure that the air is constantly changed. Underfloor and overhead
heating is installed in the brooders and machine-washed drip-dry mats
are used for the brooder floors. Bantam-borne diseases are avoided,
for bantams are used only for incubation of eggs for the first two
weeks, the eggs then being transferred to incubators.
The ducklings remain in the brooders for upwards of ten days and
are then moved to larger brooders with reduced heating where they
stay until feathered and ready to go out of doors.
A considerably improved survival rate, particularly among the most
difficult and delicate ducklings, is reported and among those reared
last summer were three White-headed Oxyura leucocephala , a species
never before bred in captivity--except for one reared by its mother
in the European Pen at Slimbridge a few weeks earlier.

Members, particularly those who remember the President's garden
parties held at Foxwarren Park in pre-war summers, will be saddened
to hear of the death of Mr. A. P. Shearing who was in charge of Mr.
Alfred Ezra's collection from 1931 until 1956 . During that time very
many breeding successes were achieved, accounts of them, by Mr.
Ezra, being published in the avicultural magazine.

A report has been received of a recent sighting of the Ivory-billed
Woodpecker ( Campephilus principalis) in swampland south-east of
Dallas, Texas. This spectacular bird, which was formerly widespread
in the West Indies and south-eastern United States, has been called the
rarest creature on earth. Its size (21 in. in length) made it easy prey
for Texas Indians who liked its red crest feathers, and frontier hunters
who used its beak to adorn their powder pouches. By the early i92o's
it was believed to be extinct, but made one brief appearance in the
swamps of Louisiana in 1930. It disappeared again until 1948 when a
pair were seen and photographed in Cuba and in 1966 one bird was
seen in East Texas where other sightings have been reported since;
also in Florida and South Carolina. However, this species is a wan-
derer and this latest sighting may well be of the same bird seen
previously elsewhere.
Other apparently less welcome sightings have been recorded recently
in the eastern United States where large numbers of Quaker Parrakeets
(Myiopsitta monacha) have become established in the wild, presumably
descended from free-flying colonies and aviary escapees. In its native
Argentina the Quaker Parrakeet is considered one of the worst pests
to agriculture and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Albany, New
York, alarmed by reports of flocks 4,000 strong, has issued a plea to
people sighting the birds or their nests to inform them of their location.
The Duke of Bedford in " Parrots and Parrot-like Birds " stated that
the Quaker is an excessively hardy bird and the only thing that will
kill it is permanent confinement in a cage; American fanners obviously
have other views on this statement.

From Denmark, Mr. E. Norgaard Olesen wrote in December :
" This year has been rather bad for me as regards breeding results.
I have no young. The Blue-winged Mountain Tanagers had a nest of
two eggs, as did the Turquoise Tanagers (T. mexicana ) but in both
cases the young disappeared on the date of hatching. The Brazilian
Tanagers ( R . bresilius) had several nests, one young one reaching the
age of eight days. The Hanging Parrakeets had fertile eggs, but no
young ones left the nests. But this is what happens now and then, and
one has to be patient. I hear that people all around Europe have had
a bad year.
" I have just made a survey and find that up to the present I have
kept seventy species of tanagers and euphonias, several as more than
one subspecies, and in the case of Thraupis palmarum all four sub-
species."

Mr. F. W. Behrent, a member living in Warzanini, New Zealand,
who breeds pheasants and peafowl, writes about the general situation
in that country : " Private persons are not permitted to keep many of
the native birds in captivity which to my mind is a pity. So far as I
know, it is only possible to keep the native parrakeet and the Weka
(Galliralius). I have never kept parrakeets and have never seen them
in the wild. I have kept Wekas; they have laid and incubated but
never successfully hatched and eventually died of old age. I have no
idea how long they live. I had these birds fifteen years and they were
wild-caught and mature when I received them from the Wildlife
Division of Internal Affairs. The above mentioned Department main-
tains a wildlife station (Mount Bruce) in the Wairapa in the southern
part of North Island. They have had success breeding some of the
rarer birds but so far the Notornis has them beaten. It is a pity that
this was not started fifty years ago as it seems fairly certain that the
Kakapo is now on the verge of extinction il not already extinct. Most
New Zealand birds are fearless, there were no native mammals but
now there are introduced cats, rats, stoats, ferrets and weasels, and the
Australian oppossum which eats birds' eggs".

The current issue of the National Audubon Society's journal gives
a fairly gloomy forecast for the future of the Puerto Rican Parrot
(Amazona vittata). Once common through most of its native island
and nearby Culebra, the latest count revealed 16-18 birds living in the
Luquillo rainforest, three captive birds at the Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center in Maryland, U.S.A., and another five captive birds
(all nestlings) in an installation in Puerto Rico, maintained by the
Patuxent Center. Although efforts to save the Puerto Rican Amazon
in the wild have so far cost the Puerto Rican Government $65,000 and
the World Wildlife Fund $15,000, its slide towards extinction seems
almost certain and the main hope would appear to be captive breeding.
Two of the Maryland birds are known to be female, having laid
several clutches of eggs during the eighteen years they spent together
at the former home in Mayaguez Zoo, Puerto Rico, and the Patuxent
Center is now hoping that a newly-arrived youngster, caught in the
wild last year, may turn out to be a male.

islands is in such immediate danger, they too are all caught in the
squeeze of expanding human populations and the accompanying dis-
turbance of nature, and may eventually face the same fate as their
Puerto Rican relative. It would seem important, therefore, for avicul-
turists to establish good captive breeding populations of these birds

During 1973 there was a rapid upswing in the number of dove en-
thusiasts in the U.S.A. and this is evident in part by the organisation
of the American Dove Association with headquarters in the Eastern
States. This newly fonned group publishes an informative monthly
Bulletin for its members. Moreover it has been instrumental in formu-
lating a standard for exhibition purposes, currently limited mainly to
domesticated breeds such as white and Barbary Doves. At various
pigeon shows in the Eastern States these have been exhibited; also
some foreign doves such as Green-winged and Bleeding Heart. The
number of dove fanciers is especially large in states such as California
and Florida which have a mild winter climate.
There have been importations of doves from the Philippine Islands
recently and a shipment of about 90 Bartlett's Bleeding Heart Doves
reached Southern California via a quarantine station in Honolulu.
So keen is the demand for this colourful and rather difficult-to-breed
species that the lot was speedily disposed of at 200 dollars per pair,
assuredly a typically inflationary price. Crowned pigeons [Gourd) in
large numbers also reached Southern California : they are being offered
at prices from 800 to 1250 dollars per pair, but have, at the time of
writing, found few takers. The growing interest in breeding foreign
doves in the U.S.A. is the result in part of informative articles which
have appeared in three different avicultural publications and in books
published on the subject.

vogelleben. By jurgen nigolai (with introduction by Konrad Lorenz.
Published by Chr. Belser Verlag, Stuttgart, 1973. No price shown.
Large illustrated books on birds can sometimes be disappointing;
the text obviously written by some hack who has "mugged up" his
information with more haste than discernment, the lovely pictures
themselves marred by the errors and inanities of some trendy caption
writer. No one who knows the works of either Jurgen Nicolai or
Konrad Lorenz will have any fears that such is the case with this
large illustrated book; nor is it.
Konrad Lorenz's introductory chapter "Ornithology and Ecology"
should please all serious aviculturists, as he emphasises the great im-
portance of tame, hand-reared wild birds for behaviour studies, and
the desirability for all such studies to be undertaken only by people
who enjoy watching their birds irrespective of whether or not any
scientific discoveries are going to be made thereby. New to me, and
of enthralling interest, was his account of some of his childhood aspira-
tions and activities. Thwarted in his wish to be a duck, he opted, as
second best, to have a duck. Fortunately his mother and some duck-
owning neighbours were sympathetic and the far-reaching result was
a mutual "imprinting" between the four-year-old boy and his first
duckling.
The subsequent chapters in the 207 pages of text: "Birds as world
citizens". "The wooing of a mate", "Nestbuilding and care of the

young", "Partitioning out the sources of food", "Defence from enemies
--camouflage and deception", "Bird flight and the great migrations",
and the captions to the pictures are written by Jurgen Nicolai. Dr.
Nicolai is not only one of the world's leading figures in bird be-
haviour studies, he also has the ability, demonstrated throughout this
book, to write in a clear, compelling and absorbingly interesting
manner.
The book is illustrated with 144 coloured photographs, all care-
fully chosen to illustrate some aspect of the text. Among the many
that greatly impressed me were those of a Kori Bustard patrolling
the edge of a bush fire in search of prey, of a male Senegal Sand-
grouse watering his young from his belly feathers, and of a mixed
flock of Scarlet Macaws and Red and Green Macaws eating salty
earth from a river bank in the Peruvian forest.
I can wholeheartedly recommend this book for all who are inter-
ested in birds and can read German. I hope it will soon be translated
into English for those who cannot.

beginner's guide to birdkeeping. By rosemary low. Pelham Books.
London 1974. Pp. 217. 13 coloured plates, 16 photographs and 19 line
drawings. Price #3.50.
This well produced book contains chapters on starting with birds,
their housing, hygiene and the treatment of the sick or injured, diets,
pet birds, exhibiting, breeding and general care of many kinds of
small bird both wild and domesticated. There are appendices on
classification, record-keeping, a short list of books for further reading
and a list of suppliers (in this country) of the bird fancier's requisites.
There are two good indices.
It is said on p. 9 that cage and aviary birds can be divided into
five sections, but the Bengalese has been omitted, though, as stated
later, it really deserves a chapter to itself and is certainly one of the
best of birds for a beginner. The topography of a bird (p. 13) gives
the impression that the under tail-coverts are above the tail and the
upper ones get no mention. The scapulars are wrongly placed and
there is no mention of mantle or flanks, terms often used in printed
descriptions. It is said (p. 190) that an excess of live food in the diet
can cause eye trouble including blindness--is there really any evidence
to support this statement? Zosterops are said to be hardy and can
safely be wintered out of doors. There is a great difference between
winter in the south-west and the north-east and the position of the
aviary is an important factor ; also it is one thing to survive a winter's

night and another to do so in reasonable comfort. Do Zosterops really
eat black aphids? Would not carrot be a better food for mealworms
than cabbage leaf or spinach? The Green Glossy Starling is an old
name for Lamprocolius chalybeus but is also used by dealers for the
Malayan ( Aplonis ) and the modern name, Blue-eared, should have
been added. There is no mention of suppliers of nectar or insectile
foods and on the dust cover the author is credited with a book on
the parrots of South Africa, whereas it was South American parrots
that she wrote about. Some of the statements are a bit dogmatic and,
as most of us have learned, it is safer to say what is likely to happen
in avicultural matters. However, both the beginner and the more
experienced will find a wealth of sound, practical and detailed advice
here.

OBSERVATIONS ON MAINTAINING AND PROPAGATING
CRANES IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996420081081081" page_id="56470832"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Kerry A. Muller (Gurator of Birds, Taronga Zoo, Sydney)
Cranes are good zoo subjects inasmuch as they are large, attractive,
easy to feed and remarkably long-lived. A Siberian White Crane lived
over 6i years in captivity and there are other instances of such
longevity. Unfortunately, they are not good breeders.
Many zoos and private aviculturists have raised various species of
crane, and a few continue to do so. Nevertheless, the importation of
birds captured in the wild far exceeds the number raised in captivity,
and very few collections have maintained a successful propagation
programme (I do not know of a single authenticated case of second
generation captive-bred cranes, although this may have occurred in
respect of Manchurian and White-naped Cranes in Japan, and Brolga
Cranes in the Healesville Sanctuary).
At least five species of crane are listed as rare and endangered and
several others are threatened, so no responsible aviculturist can continue
as a predator upon these birds.
When I was first employed by the National Zoological Park, Wash-
ington, D.C. in 1965, there were several cranes in the collection, but
the zoo had not raised any for at least 50 years. By the time I left to
come to Taronga Zoo in 1970, we had hatched 13 of three species and
raised most of them. By a combination of observation, deduction and
experimentation we had arrived at a method that seems to work.
In Taronga Zoo in 1970, we had one old pair of Brolga (Native
Companion) Cranes and a single old female Eastern Crowned Crane
in the collection (the zoo had not raised a crane in over 20 years). We
adopted the methods developed at the National Zoo and the Crowned
Crane laid two clutches of three eggs each in 1972, and one clutch of
two in 1973, all, naturally, infertile. We now have an old male recently
on loan from the Adelaide Zoo. The Brolgas laid two clutches of infer-
tile eggs in 1972 and hatched one young in 1973 from their first clutch.
Because these results from two different zoos in different environ-
ments appear to show promise, and because of several inquiries from
other zoos, I offer the following opinions for consideration by anyone
wishing to propagate cranes.
Ideally an adult, compatible pair should be obtained. Most cranes
will not lay eggs until their third year, and young males may not be
fertile until their fourth year. They may, however, be capable of repro-

ducing for well over 20 years, and in most collections where young
have been raised for several years the same pair of adults is responsible.
Cranes of the same species and race may easily be sexed after 12
months of age by the difference in height; males are considerably
longer and larger in diameter than females, and the tibiotarsus and
tarsometatarsus are demonstrably longer and larger in diameter than
in females. If sufficient numbers of birds were available for measure-
ment, fonnulae could easily be worked out for different species and
races but this seems not to have been done.
Different races of the same species may vary considerably in height.
Southern Crowned Cranes are demonstrably smaller than the eastern
race. This is also true of western Sandhill Cranes as opposed to the
eastern races.
Cranes are highly sensitive and intelligent birds and not all indi-
viduals are compatible for, like other animals, they exhibit likes and
dislikes. If an adult pair has been together for at least two years and
shows no signs of courtship activity it may be best to exchange one for
another bird.
Although cranes are gregarious in the non-breeding season, pairs are
extremely territorial when nesting. In the wild, some species such as
Whooping, Manchurian, Siberian Cranes and others, may maintain
and defend territories of several square miles. In captivity nesting pairs
should be kept out of visual and audial contact with each other. It is
the practice of some zoos to keep several species, such as Crowned or
Demoiselle Cranes in flocks, often together with waterfowl and hoofed
stock. Under these conditions mortality is high and they seldom breed.
Large cranes can be quite dangerous to smaller birds and are highly
sensitive to disturbance by other animals when nesting, so this is also
a reason for isolating breeding pairs in their own paddocks.
If breeding cranes are in adjacent paddocks, partitions should be
solid or opaque. Even pinioned cranes are quite adept at jumping or
climbing mesh fences; I once saw a male Crowned Crane scale a 7 ft.
chain-link fence, kill the adjacent male, and return to its own paddock,
all within a few minutes.
In the wild, cranes construct nests from long grass or reeds which
may be pulled from the close vicinity around the nest, or merely bent
over. In a bare or neatly mowed paddock they may not nest, and any
activity with a power-mower during the spring may completely deter
them for the season. It is best to allow weeds, reeds and grass to grow
long during the spring and early summer, and to plant grass for this
purpose if necessary. This additionally provides the birds with a sense
of security in concealing the nest, and harbours insects which they
delight in stalking. On the other hand, cranes are birds of the open
spaces and prefer relatively unrestricted vision, so trees and shrubs
should be reduced or eliminated from the area. Admittedly an over-

grown paddock may prove unsightly to the public, but a sign or
graphic explaining the purpose of this can be interesting and informa-
tive.
There has been some contention over the years on proper diet for
cranes in captivity, and each zoo may offer a different formula. Cranes
generally are omnivorous and adaptable in diet, and appear to be in
good health on widely differing diets. Wild cranes feed primarily on
grains and other vegetable matter in the winter months, and on protein
rich foods during the spring and summer. In captivity, food is usually
available with little effort, space is restricted, and the birds are unable
to fly and thus burn off excess calories and maintain proper muscle
tone. Under these conditions they are often overweight--although they
may not appear obese. As any good aviculturist knows, a fat bird breeds
poorly and is often infertile. Additionally, many cranes, particularly
Grus species, forage in the wild on crustaceans and other invertebrates
which are unusually high in mineral and vitamin content. I suspect
that cranes require a higher concentration of calcium and other
minerals and vitamins than most other birds, particularly when breed-
ing.
Following the above hypothesis, a search was made at the National
Zoo for a diet high in protein and mineral content. We discovered a
product made by a local commercial poultry feed company called
"Chicken Breeder Chowder" (Appendix). This contained 36% pro-
tein, was high in mineral and vitamin content and low in fats and
carbohydrates. It was formulated to be used by poultry breeders as an
additive to a grain diet. It was produced in a " crumble " form but we
had it made into pellets so that cranes could consume it readily. We
discontinued all other food, offering the pellets only. For most birds the
high protein level of this diet would result in a considerable weight
loss, but it proved to be excellent for cranes. In long spells of very cold
weather in the winter we added some grain to provide extra calories
for heat generation. This was discontinued immediately at the onset of
warm weather. After using this diet for over six years on seven species,
I am convinced that it is the most suitable for propagation of cranes
in captivity.
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the captive propagation is
the question of natural versus artificial incubation and rearing of the
chicks. The normal clutch size for cranes is two (three for Eastern
Crowned Cranes) and if the eggs are removed a second, and often third
clutch are laid. The eggs are readily hatched in incubators, and chicks
hand-reared if food is presented by hand for the first five to seven days,
and precautions are taken to avoid rickets and related leg problems. I
have strong doubts, however, as to the suitability of hand -reared young
for future propagation.
Unlike the majority of birds raised artificially, which are primarily

Anseriformes and Galliformes, cranes invariably become strongly im-
printed when hand-reared. The behaviour of Anseriformes and Galli-
formes is largely innate, and they revert to natural behaviour when
breeding. Cranes have a higher component of learned behaviour and
hand-raised birds usually try to mate with their keeper and attack or
ignore other cranes. I am not aware of a single instance where both
members of a breeding pair of cranes were hand-raised. I know of one
or two instances where a hand-raised female has mated successfully
with a wild-caught male.
Close observations of young Stanley, Crowned and Brolga Cranes
being hatched and raised by their parents revealed a whole range of
vocal and visual communication between the parents and young just
preceding, during, and after hatching. Calls could be heard from the
chicks at least 24 hours preceding hatching, these being answered by
calls and " clucks " from the adults. After the initial opening was made
in the eggshell by the chick, the adults assisted hatching by breaking
away and removing small pieces of shell. Shortly after the young had
hatched the adults frequently gave their " triumph " dance, accom-
panied by strong antiphonal vocalizations. Within 36 hours the young
had learned to respond to the danger calls of the adult by dropping flat
on the ground, or running away from the adults and hiding in tall
vegetation. They would later return to the adults when the " all clear "
call was made. I am convinced that this learned range of vocal and
visual behaviour during the family life of young birds is important in
their subsequent adult and breeding behaviour. My opinions in this
regard differ from most authorities on cranes, such as Dr. George
Archibald of the International Grane Trust, John " Gus " Griswold of
the Philadelphia Zoo and Glen Smart of the Patuxent Wildlife
Research Centre. A logical compromise would be to remove the first
clutch and hand-rear them, taking every precaution to avoid imprint-
ing on humans, and to allow the parents to raise their second clutch.
When parent birds are allowed to raise their own young, care must
be taken to avoid certain dangers. For the first two weeks the young
are very small and vulnerable to predators, such as rats, cats, crows,
hawks, etc. The parents do not always recognise these as dangerous,
and it is up to the keepers to guard against them. Young cranes can slip
through a rather small hole in a fence, and will often do so when
responding to the alarm call of the parents, so care must be taken that
the fence is free of such holes near the bottom. Chicks also can drown
easily in deep water or steep-sided pools, so it is best to allow them only
enough water to drink.
The diet of young cranes is very important. For the first few days
the parents feed the young by offering them bits of food in the beak.
For the first four to six weeks we fed our young cranes 50% crane
pellets, 25% gamebird startina, 20% ground raw meat fortified with

vitamins and minerals, 1 % cooked egg yolk, and 4% mixed grain, fed
twice daily on a. flat pan. Mealworms, crickets and grasshoppers, as
available, were supplemented for the first two weeks and after six
weeks they were fed crane pellets only. We never had a single case of
rickets or leg problems with our young birds, and they usually
exceeded their parents in size when adult.
Because zoos must cater to exhibition, and because each breeding
pair of cranes must have their own paddock, it is difficult for any one
institution to maintain a viable breeding stock. Zoos can seldom afford
to duplicate or triplicate the same exhibit, and the young birds that are
raised should not be interbred. It is therefore imperative that a super-
vised system of exchange is maintained among zoos and related institu-
tions, and that each bird be banded and records kept of its lineage, etc.
If surplus young are raised beyond the housing capabilities of the zoo
they should be farmed out to other zoos proved capable of properly
housing and breeding them. Young should be interchanged to avoid
inbreeding.
A breeding pair of cranes is capable of reproduction for many years,
and because of the length of time involved, and because the young do
not mature for several years, insufficient attention has been paid to
crane management in zoos in the past. Unless the past role of zoos and
aviculturists is changed from that of a predator to that of a consistent
producer, they will have failed in the conservation of cranes.

Columbina talpacoti
By Jeffrey Trollope (Hounslow, Middlesex)
This small dove is also known as the Ruddy Ground Dove, Blue-
headed Ground Dove, Cinnamon Dove and Stone Dove, and is often
called Pigmy Dove by dealers in common with congenerics such as
C. minuta.
Importations are fairly frequent, but the Talpacoti Dove is not such
a popular aviary bird as, for example, the Diamond Dove and certain
Streptopelia species.
Breeding in captivity has occurred quite often, but published records
are very few and probably the first in this country is that of Castle-
Stone (1903-4).
Description
From three males and four females :
A compact bird with a rather short tail; length overall 7 in.
Male: Bill horn coloured; irides dark brown with outer ring of red;
orbital skin grey. Top and sides of head and nape bluish-grey; throat
greyish-white. Rest of plumage pinkish-chestnut, looking very red in
sunlight. Black spots of variable size and shape on wings; primaries
blackish with narrow brown tips on the outer feathers; tail feathers
black, tipped with light brown; legs and feet a light flesh colour.
Female: Irides dark brown with outer ring of yellowish or buffish-
brown. The pinkish-chestnut plumage of the male is replaced by brown
on the upper surface and lighter brown below. Wing and tail markings,
leg and foot colour as for male. One female had narrow white margins
on the lateral black tail feathers.
Young at 18 days: Irides dark brown; bill greyish-brown; light greyish-
white area around lores and ear-coverts. Upper parts brown with black
spots on wings not so distinct as in adults. Lower surface light buffy
brown; legs and feet greyish-brown.
A pair of Talpacoti Doves hatched in August 1972 showed sexual
dimorphism in plumage at approximately 60 days and after a moult in
March 1973, the smaller "female" had complete male plumage.
Distribution and Habitat
De Schauensee (1971) gives the distribution as the drier parts of the
Guianas, Venezuela and Colombia, south to northern Argentina, acci-
dentally as far south as Tucuman and Buenos Aires (sight records in
Chile and Uruguay), Margarita Island, Trinidad and Tobago. He
includes in this species buckleyi which breeds in arid coastal Ecuador
and north-western Peru.
The habitat of talpacoti is recorded as shrubby savanna, pastures,
gardens and towns.

A "pair" of birds purchased in February 1966, proved to be two
hens (Pair A). They were housed in an outside aviary from May to
October. The enclosure was 12 ft. x 8 ft. x 8 ft., and was planted with
privet bushes. Random observations were made during this period.
A true pair (Pair B), obtained in August 1971, were housed in an
outside aviary 7 ft. x 5 ft. x 6 ft. 6 in. from June to November 1972.
The aviary was planted with two privet bushes, thick clumps of gorse
were hung at various heights to provide nesting sites and cover. Four
Chestnut Sparrows Sorella eminibey and a pair of Harlequin Quail
Coturnix delegorguei were housed in the same aviary. The doves were
very nervous at first, but settled after a few weeks.
This pair were watched from the house with binoculars and from a
distance of 10 feet from the aviary.
Food
Seeds available were plate yellow and pearl white panicum millets,
hemp, rape, niger, maw seed and small canary seed. As far as I could
see, only the smaller seeds were eaten. Wheat and dari were given to
both pairs, which either could not or would not eat them, so they were
discontinued.
Liberal amounts of ground cuttlefish bone, fine oystershell, grit, sand
and Kilpatrick's Pigeon Minerals were always available. The food,
water, minerals, etc., were placed in pots on the floor and on a feeding
platform four feet off the ground. Sand covered the aviary floor.
Reproductive activity " Pair " A
The two hens obtained in February 1966, laid 10 eggs during the
period February to August. These consisted of three clutches of two
and a joint effort of four.
Three nests were made; in each case the birds ignored what I con-
sidered to be suitable small twigs provided. Wood-wool, dried grasses
and straw were used; the nests were very substantial for doves, the
largest being approximately 7 in. deep and 5 in. across, with a shallow
but well defined cup. Sometimes the second hen would sit on the nest
with the " incubating " bird. Dual " incubation " seemed to be almost
constant during the double clutch. They sat on the two single clutches
and the double one for 8, 1 o and 11 days respectively.
Breeding Pair B
The birds were released into the aviary on 8th June, 1972; the cock
had been giving the advertising call for some weeks before and he
began driving the hen two days after release.

Nest
The site was in a thick clump of gorse, five feet up and the cock was
observed picking up material on the aviary floor and taking it to the
site; the hen built the nest. As with the nests of " Pair" A, it was a
substantial structure made of dried grasses and wood-wool; twigs were
available but not used.
The same nest was used for the five clutches laid (Table i); after the
first brood had left, a ring of dried droppings surrounded the cup.
There was no apparent rearrangement of existing material, a small
amount of wood-wool was added to the base.
Eggs
The eggs were glossy white and " short " elliptical. Four measured
22.7 x 16.0 (1) 21.0 x 16.4 (1) and 21.0 x 16.0 mm. (2). One egg which
was not measured was larger than normal and could be described as
oval or ovate.

unfortunately just by the aviary door. I entered to feed and water as
carefully as possible and the birds did not panic, either the hen or cock
would leave the nest and walk along the thicker gorse stems until
about 18 inches away and then keep still. It was noticeable that the
cock left the nest before the hen; the latter would sometimes remain
and ignore my activities.
As far as could be ascertained the hen always sat at night; the
cock's share of diurnal incubation over the first io days of clutch 2
is shown in Table 2. This pattern did not seem to differ in the success-
ful incubation of clutch 4. The unsuccessful clutches 1, 3 and 5 were
deserted and removed, 1 and 3 were fertile.

Chicks

<bodyText confidence="0.997708242424242" page_id="56470840"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
In both broods the chicks hatched on consecutive days, a broken
eggshell was found on the floor and a chick and egg were seen in the
nest. The nest would be checked again, as late in the day as possible,
but the second chick did not hatch until the next day.
Brooding of the chicks was performed by both sexes, with similar
time periods and change-overs to diurnal incubation and the cock
would often sit alongside the hen when she was brooding.
On one occasion the cock was covering the chicks and the hen sat
on his back in a crosswise position, for about 20 minutes. When the
young were 9-10 days, both adults often covered the chicks, apparently
brooding one each.
One chick of the first brood left the nest in the morning, the second,
noticeably smaller than its sibling, followed in the early evening. This
chick was unable to fly up to the higher perches for the first three days
and roosted on the ground. The larger one roosted with the adults, in
a close contact clumped position, near the nest. Both young roosted
with the father in the same position when the hen was incubating the
next clutch.
The chicks were seen feeding themselves when 21 days old, although
they still followed the father to solicit food, for two or three days after-
wards. They were removed from the aviary when 27 days old.
The second brood followed the same pattern as the first, the chicks
hatching on consecutive days and leaving the nest the same day, but
with a time lag. The first to leave was larger and more active than its
sibling. They were seen feeding themselves on the 22nd day from
hatching. The smaller chick was found dead when 24 days old,
although it appeared well nourished without signs of injury or disease.
The survivor was left in the aviary with the adults, until they were
removed to heated quarters in November. When the parents were incu-
bating clutch 5, this chick (which proved to be a female) was seen
sitting on the eggs while the parents were feeding. Later the cock was
sitting and the hen took over in the afternoon. This chick sat on top
of the adults on one occasion, when they were both on the nest.

The wing-flick display is given by both sexes, but most often by the
cock when he approaches or is being approached by the hen, or chases
her, and also during nest-calling.
It is sometimes accompanied by a head bow, but I have not seen the
bow in the nest-calling situation. Once I saw the cock making lateral
bows to left and right while wing-flicking instead of the usual bow in
line with the body. It would appear that the wing flicked is on the side
nearest the hen, if she approaches facing the cock, both wings are
flicked.
Billing, allopreening and wing-flicking, with and without the head
bow, precede copulation.
A young cock, having nearly full adult plumage at 69 days, was seen
wing-flicking when approached by his sibling. The two hens housed
together would often wing-flick, when one of them was approached by
its " partner ".
Single birds of pair A and B, have been observed lifting one wing,
fully extended and holding it in this position for approximately 30
seconds. This wing-lift is always given when perched and seems to be
the same full extension of one wing that is given during sun-bathing,
when the birds are in close contact on the ground. However, this wing-
lift has only been observed on dry, but sunless days and the 54 partner "
whether cock or hen was not close to or approaching the actor.

Voice
The advertising call given by the cock is a disyllabic " 00-woo ",
repeated rapidly four or five times. Goodwin (1967) remarks that there
does not appear to be a different vocalization for nest calling, the nest
call and advertising call I have heard sound identical.
The only other vocalization noted is a nervous " 000 " or sometimes
" oop ", when the birds are disturbed or anxious.

Sunbathing Posture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984367" page_id="56470842"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
This has often been observed with both pairs, the birds sit in a
sunny spot on the aviary floor, in close contact with each other, their
dorsal surfaces exposed to the sun. Frequently one bird will lie on its
side and lift a fully extended wing, exposing the underside to the sun.
Interactions with other Species
When a quail moved near the doves they would sometimes begin to
flick one wing, but they would lift the wing higher, well clear of the
body, as if to buffet the quail. A complete wing-lift, with the wing fully
extended, has also been observed when a quail has approached a dove
in a box cage 4 ft. x 2 ft. x 3 ft. This wing-lift appears to be the same
action as that described in displays.
A cock Chestnut Sparrow was seen trying to copulate with the hen
dove on one occasion. The dove walked along the perch for about 2 ft.
with the sparrow on its back, before the sparrow flew away. Pair B
have lived amicably with a pair of Emerald Doves, Chalcophaps indica,
in an indoor aviary 6 ft. x 4 ft. x 6 ft. during the winter.

The breeding habits of these doves in captivity seems to be similar to
those of Buckley's Ground Dove ( buckleyi ), Hanover (1969). Both build
substantial nests, and the eggs are laid and the chicks hatch on consecu-
tive days, with an incubation period of 14 days.
The Talpacoti Doves roosted, nested and often fed off-ground; how-
ever, owing to the size of the aviary, I think they felt insecure on the
ground, without a good field of vision. It was noticeable that the two
hens housed in a larger aviary seemed to spend more time on the
ground, feeding and sunbathing and appeared to be more relaxed.
Hanover (1969) observed a broken-wing distraction display in cap-
tive buckleyi when their nest was approached in a large aviary, a very
different reaction from Pair B, with what could be described as a
" hiding " attempt when the aviary was entered. The wing-lift some-
times given by these doves when perched, appears to be the same
action observed in some species of doves when rain bathing. This is an
activity I have not so far noted with the Talpacoti.

THE RED-CHEEKED MACAW
(Ara rubrogenys)
By John Halford (Broughton, Stockbridge, Hants)
In February 1973 I obtained one Red-cheeked Macaw with a

promise of more to come. The bird was in poor condition and not
eating at all well, so I kept it in heat (85*F.) and tried various foods
such as corn on the cob, boiled maize, sunflower seed, brown bread and
peanut butter, fruit, Farex baby food with honey added, but of these,
only the corn on the cob and boiled maize with Abidec vitamin com-
pound added were eaten. After about a month the macaw worried me
considerably, as it started sicking up the little food it was eating; more-
over it was very thin, so I gave it antibiotics, increased the heat and it
recovered from being sick, but still ate very little. For about a further
month the bird's condition remained static and then it again began
vomiting, so I gave the treatment as before and it recovered. I suspected
the cause of the sickness was the corn on the cob (deep frozen and
bought from a supermarket) so I discontinued this and relied on the
boiled maize alone for some days. Then I tried giving some semi-
roasted peanuts (the bird refused the peanuts in the shell and the rest
of the usual parrot mixture one buys) whereupon for the first time it
had the good sense to eat a nut of any kind. I tried repeatedly to get
information on how the macaw had been fed in Bolivia, but without
success and I suspect that its diet had been the usual boiled maize.
As the hoped for consignment of further Ara rubrogenys failed to
arrive and there was no word from Bolivia about them, I put a tame
Ara manilata with the rubrogenys in the hope that the one would teach
the other to eat the foods provided for my other macaws. I had been
wary of introducing another bird to the Red-cheeked as I was not sure
what was wrong with it, but anyway the two got on well together and
by degrees it learned to eat the other foods, though I continued to give

the roasted peanuts and after about a month the newcomer had
improved so much that I put them both,, at the end of May, into an
outdoor aviary where they have lived ever since. They are not given
any artificial heat and are not shut in at night, but they do go into the
aviary shelter.
In October 1973 when I had almost given up hope of obtaining more
Red-cheeked, I received a further four which I think are two pairs.
They have wintered inside and have thrived, though again I had diffi-
culty in getting them to eat and they still only take the boiled maize
and roasted peanuts, so later I shall get my original bird to teach them
its acquired diet even though they are meantime doing well. At a
rubrogenys is only found in a small part of Bolivia, I am told; it is
correctly described in several books and said to be rare, but how rare
must surely be a matter of conjecture where observation must be diffi-
cult. To describe the colours in writing is to give a vague picture, a
good coloured photograph or drawing being far better. My birds are in
size between the Severe and the Military Macaw, A. severa and
militarise olive green with blue primaries and tail feathers. The fore-
head is orange-red and this colour extends over the top of the head
and is repeated in a spot behind the eye, on the bend of the wing and
on the thighs. A small bare area of pinkish-white skin on the lores is
lined with small blackish-brown feathers and there is a strip of bare
skin around the eye and at the base of the lower mandible, as in the
Hyacinthine Macaw. The beak and feet are dark grey and the irides
yellow. The voice is very difficult to describe, but my birds give a
medium pitched gurgle and a more raucous cry when excited. The five
birds are relatively tame, but not too tame for breeding, so it is my
duty and intention to get them established outside and, of course, to try
to breed from them.
Miss Rosemary Low writes :
In the words of Joseph Forshaw, author of parrots of the world,
this is " the least known of all South American parrots ". It was quite
unknown to aviculture until 1973 and there appears to be no published
information on its habits in the wild. It is a native of Bolivia where it
is found in the province of Cochabamba, also probably in Santa Cruz.
Immature birds have much less red on the crown and ear-coverts, no
red on the smaller wing-coverts, shoulders and carpal edge of the wing.
The under wing-coverts are pale orange and the thighs greenish, tinged
with orange.

This generic nomenclature originates from C. L. Bonaparte--C on-
spectus Genera Avium Vol. i p. 3 (1849).
The term Chalcopsitta is an amalgam of chalco, meaning bronze or
copper, and psitta--a parrot.
This genus is sub-divided into five species and six subspecies and the
distinguishing features of these birds are a long tail and a naked base
to the lower mandible.
It would seem that the species comprising the genera Chalcopsitta
and Eos show many similarities and more thorough study might ulti-
mately suggest that the two be combined.

Ornithology
I can trace very little information concerning this species 5 habits in
the wild. However, those who have observed the Black Lory in the
wild state that it frequents well broken woodland, forest edges and
savannah, it congregates in large flocks and is frequently seen feeding
from the flowers of trees.
Aviculture
I believe that the first living example to reach this country was a
single bird collected by Mr. Walter Goodfellow in 1905. This bird
which had been hand reared and was consequently very tame, was
captured in N.W. New Guinea. On the voyage it was fed on Swiss
milk and fruit and on arrival in England was acquired by Mrs. E. J.
Johnstone of Rougham Hall, Bury St. Edmunds. Although this was
the first Black Lory to reach England, Mr. Frank Finn had seen living
examples in Calcutta before that date.
First Breeding of Black Lory in Britain
In 1907, Walter Goodfellow succeeded in landing a further three
Black Lories and these were purchased by Mr. E. J. Brook, of Hoddam
Castle, Ecclefechan. These birds which were all tame, proved to be
two cocks (one adult and one immature) and a hen of uncertain age.
These three birds were housed together in an aviary and agreed very
well.
In May, 1909, two eggs were laid in a large nest box; these were
incubated by all three birds, but eventually proved to be infertile. Two
further eggs were laid in mid-June, but incubation did not commence
until a week after laying and on this occasion the old cock was refused
access to the nest box. One chick hatched after an incubation period
of approximately three weeks. This chick was brooded assiduously by
the parents for two weeks, after which they would leave it for about
an hour a day. However, in the absence of the parents the old cock
took over brooding, and this old bird was also again permitted to roost
in the box nest with the family at night.
The youngster fledged at eight weeks. At this age it closely resembled
the adults, except it had a few small splashes of blood red and the skin
around the eyes and lower mandible was white.
The diet that these birds received consisted of " Sop made with

occasionally a little biscuit or bread added for a change; they also
had fruit. 55
First Breeding of Black Lory in U.S.A.
This took place in San Diego Zoological Gardens in 1969. The
parent birds were purchased from P. H. Hastings who then operated
from Portsmouth, England, and arrived at the Zoological Gardens on
21st September, 1967. These birds, which were immature, were
housed in an aviary 6 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. x 7 ft. furnished with a nest box
12 in. square x i6# in. high; the entrance hole was 4 in. x 3 in.
On 16th March, 1969, the female was observed to be incubating
a single egg and on the following day the second egg was laid. On
10th April, when the nest was examined, one egg had hatched and
on the nth the second also hatched--incubation was therefore 24-25
days.
As the parents stopped feeding the chicks when they were six weeks
old, they were removed and reared by hand.
The diet of the adult birds consisted of bread and milk sweetened
with Karo syrup to which was added diced apple (fresh and stewed),
finely ground carrots, raisins or currants which had been soaked,
chopped grapes, figs, papaya and sponge cake. During the breeding
season supplies of steamed bone meal, cuttlefish bone meal and Abidec
(vitamin compound) were added to this mixture.
San Diego has found that bananas and citrus fruits cause indigestion
to lories, and fits and paralysis of the legs may result.

the time so must trust to memory.
One bird bounded sideways along a perch in typical lory fashion
until about nine inches from the supposed female, both birds then
stretched to their full height and indulged in short bursts of rapid
wing-flapping interspersed by bouts of vertical bobbing. They then
stretched their necks and turned their heads at right angles to the
vertically held neck and although I could not hear through the glass
aviary front, I assume that they " sissed " as do other lories when
indulging in a similar display. The supposed male then fed the female,
the female moved away, was followed by the male who mounted and
copulated.
Although I assumed these two birds to be a true pair, I cannot be
certain, as I have become exasperated trying to sex lories and lorikeets
by behaviour. It seems that they are absolute philanderers and because
two birds display and apparently copulate it cannot be certain that
they are of opposite sexes.

Remarks

<bodyText confidence="0.997656958333334" page_id="56470849"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
It would seem that this subspecies only differs from the nominate
race in that it possesses some red flecking and it was this feature
which prompted Rosenberg to identify it as a distinct subspecies.
Count Salvadori and Dr. F. H. H. Guiilemard subsequently upheld
this decision. However, both skins and the living examples now
reaching this country in unprecedented numbers seem to vary
infinitely in the amount of red flecking that they possess. Therefore
rather than there being two distinct groups consisting of examples
with and without red flecking, it would appear that a spectrum of
variation exists ranging from specimens showing no red to those in
which red predominates (now identified as Chaleopsitta insignis
insignis). It would therefore seem difficult in practice to define at
what point in this spectrum the subspecific transition occurs.
I therefore have some doubt that Chaleo psitta atra bernsteini
warrants subspecific classification.
An Appeal for Information Relating to the Loriinae
As readers will be aware, lories and lorikeets are widely kept and
bred, yet in spite of this interest and the fund of knowledge that
must now exist, very little written information is available. With this
fact, and the difficulty of accurate identification sometimes experi-
enced, in mind, I decided to compile a set of notes that might be of
help and in order that they may be as comprehensive as possible I
appeal to members to send any information, illustrations or photo-
graphs that are relevant to me at 164 Chelmer Road, Chelmsford,

BREEDING THE POPE CARDINAL
Paroaria dominicana
By Robin L. Restall (Madrid, Spain)
Introduction
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.996551" page_id="56470849"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
This species is found in eastern Brazil where it inhabits forest
clearings, scrubland, parks and gardens. It seems to be something of
the Brazilian equivalent of the North American Cardinal Cardinalis
cardinalis in its ubiquity and lack of fear of man. It has a loud and
cheerful, although not particularly elegant, song which is uttered
throughout the day by the male during the breeding season. How-
ever, in my experience, one is most likely to hear it during the early
morning.
Although normally known as Paroaria dominicana , tire species
may be found as P. larvata. The common names are Pope, Red-
headed, Red-cowled and Dominican Cardinal.
It is regularly imported and is not expensive for such a fine bird.

However, the sexes are virtually impossible to tell apart and this
fact undoubtedly results in many " pairs " being of the same sex. In
my experience a true pair can be willing breeders, and not aggressive
in a mixed collection.
Description
About 7 to 8 inches long. The adult bird has the head and throat
crimson red; above, from nape to tail grey with some irregular black
marks and white blotches on the scapulars, the wing and tail feathers
are dark grey edged with paler; below, white. The bill is blackish
above, whitish below; eye sepia; legs grey.
The juvenile is smaller with a shorter tail, duller above and below,
and has the red of the head greyish-reddish-brown.
There are several other red-headed cardinals from S. America but
all of these (with the exception of the Red-crested) may be distin-
guished, among other differences, by having the lores black.
Feeding
Pope Cardinals may be maintained on an all seed diet. Advice in the
literature varies from " budgerigar mixture " to quite complicated
menus. One author suggests oats, berries, " universal food " and such
green food as lettuce, chickweed and twigs with leaf buds on them,
wholemeal bread, mashed potatoes, apples, hemp and sunflower seed.
I recently saw an example in a pet shop that had been fed exclusively
on a canary/millet mixture for a long time. It was very melanised,
nearly all the white feathering being black. This may have been due to
other factors, however.
The birds referred to below were kept in an outdoor aviary in
Surrey, England, well planted, and containing a small collection of
softbills and seed-eaters. They were thus able to eat from the follow-
ing : canary mixture, plain canary seed, plain millet seeds, Sluis
universal (insectile food), canary rearing food, sliced oranges, bananas.
Every morning a handful of maggots (fly larvae) and a handful of
mealworms were thrown across the flight area. I regret that I did not
carry out any controlled feeding experiments.
Housing
Pope Cardinals may be kept in cages, but they are lively birds and
there is no doubt that they do very much better in outdoor aviaries.
The particular aviary that mine bred in was set against a brick wall,
it had a flight some eight feet long that faced south and west. A
four-foot shelter covered the eastern end and the wall protected it
from the north. It was a very sheltered and sunny spot.
In this fairly small flight was a rambling vine that filled about a
third of the total space. It provided a hide-away area that all the
birds loved, and two species built nests in. Over the flight was a
clematis and the floor area was planted with sunflowers, Kniphofia
and daffodils.

Breeding
The two birds seemed to be identical in every respect, but I at first
decided that they were a couple of males as each would display to
the other. However, with increasing familiarity I felt that I could
tell them apart at a distance by behaviour and stance, the male being
perhaps a little bolder, more upright, and with slightly more white
feathering on the scapulars. Close to however there was no doubt,
for the male, as it turned out to be, had a toe missing.
Soon the male was singing practically all day while the other spent
long periods in tugging off rootlets from the end of a root stump,
and trying to pull off the pieces of string with which the millet sprays
were tied.
Display posture of male Pope Cardinal
The main courtship seemed to take place after the reunion fol-
lowing a short spell apart. For example, the female will have spent
ten minutes in the house sorting around the seed pots, after which it
would fly out to join the male in the flight. The male would bow
down, then, with body still inclined slightly forwards and down-
wards, would reach upward with its beak, exposing the red throat
and white breast patches fully. With tail fanned and wings drooped
it would utter a series of rapid chirps, chirrups, warbles and burbles.
The female performs a similar display, at the same time, but at a
lower intensity.

The duet display is immediately followed by the male still bowing,
but silently, and with head craning sky-wards, bill open. It looks
quite menacing but does not lead on to anything else.
Three weeks after the birds had been obtained and placed in their
aviary (March) it was so obvious that they wanted to nest that I
decided to do something to help. I adapted a large open-fronted box
by ramming some wire mesh across the lower half in the shape of a
crude nest. In this I laid some fine twigs and coarse grass, and hoped
that the birds would continue the good work. Instead, they threw
out all of my material and replaced it with some of their own.
It took them four days to build the kind of nest that a House
Sparrow would make in four minutes. I felt that something was
inadequate in the aviary (probably availability of nesting material)
so I helped again. On 31st March I placed a last-year's Blackbird's
nest right on top of what the cardinals had prepared and this was
accepted.
On 3rd April I felt in the nest to check on progress and found two
eggs. That evening I went on holiday, leaving the birds in the care
of a friend, and returned on 10th April to find three eggs. They were
exactly like a Blackbird's in shape and size, and similar in colouring
(dull bluish-green with brown spots and blotches) but were a little
more darkly and richly speckled.
On 17th April two eggs hatched, and on the 18th the third hatched.
At this time I noticed a fourth egg in the nest. On the 19th this
extra egg had been thrown (?) out of the nest and was seen to be
clear (or newly-laid). It was smaller and paler than the others. It
seems that the incubation might have been 14 days.
During incubation (which I believe was done by the female alone)
the male spent all the time sitting about the flight singing.
From the day that the first chicks hatched I kept up a continual
supply of live food. This was much appreciated by the other birds
in the flight. A female Roller Canary reared a healthy brood almost,
entirely on maggots, supplemented by Sluis " universal " food.
When the cardinals were one week old they were exactly the same
size as the canary nestlings that were then two weeks old. At this
stage I could clearly see the purple skin and dark grey downy feathers
on the upper parts, and the white of the breast. Brownish feathers
were growing on the breast, spotted with white tufts.
Throughout the entire nestling period, the chicks seemed well fed,
for they never once called for food to my knowledge. The diet
seemed to be about 90% maggots, the remaining 10% being made
up of mealworms, small garden worms, and a little insectile mixture.
On the evening of the 30th April, the three chicks took great
exception to my entry and suddenly found their voices. Two of them
took off out of the nest like rockets and, squawking like insane Bud-

gerigars, plummeted to my feet. The floor of the house had been
covered with a thicker covering of sawdust than usual in anticipation
of such an event, so no harm came of this. The female screeched and
really attacked my head with a performance that would do a Mistle
Thrush credit.
On ist May all three youngsters were on the perches, exactly 14
days from hatching. The canaries fledged at the same time and their
mother, set a fine example by the cardinal, also dive-bombed me at
each visit. In contrast it is worth noting that when the chicks had
been nestlings I had been completely accepted by both parents, and
each would even feed their young in my presence--and don't forget
that the house was only four feet square, but six feet high. The male,
which had shown little interest in gathering building material, nest
building or brooding, became very active when it came to feeding
the young at all stages and participated fully.
During the 14 days of the nestling period I supplied 22 ounces of
fresh maggots, and 10 ounces of mealworms. Feeding took place twice
a day, before going to work, and on my return. The maggots seemed
to be preferred in the freshly pupated stage, while the pupae are still
dark red and soft. Freshly pupated maggots were regularly mixed
with the insectile mixture, and might well have been the reason why
the cardinals took to this food.
Two days after fledging the smallest of the three chicks was found
dead. However, the two remaining birds seemed to be well cared for,
and fed regularly. The female, however, was already repairing and
relining the nest and the first egg of the second clutch appeared on
8th May, the second on the 9th and the third on the 10th.
The two nestlings from the first brood were caught and examined
and found to have slightly deformed feet. I am happy to say that
both birds gradually overcame these problems and as young adults
looked to be in perfect condition. However, I took the hint and
treated the live food given to the second brood with a multi-vitamin,
trace element additive.
A fortnight after fledging, the young cardinals were seen pecking
at millet sprays, and the male was seen to be taking seed from the
same sprays and giving it directly to the youngsters. At this time the
male showed no antagonism at all towards its offspring and all three
birds would sit side by side in the sunshine, preening themselves.
However, within a couple of days, before the second brood hatched,
both parents were seen to be attacking the two fledglings and quite
savagely. I promptly caught the innocents and placed them in a flight
cage. They eventually went to an acquaintance where they moulted
and certainly survived to the following spring at least.
The male canary regularly attacked the male cardinal, and would
do so by hovering in front of and slightly above it singing furiously.

Normally the cardinal would maintain indifference, which, being of
a rather more powerful build, stood the small canary in good stead.
However, I happened to be present on the one occasion when the
cardinal snapped at its attacker and bit it on the toe. Within a week
the canary died and this left its second clutch unguarded when the
female left the nest, and a Mesia and Pekin Robin soon polished off
the eggs. I then removed these two miscreants.
The second brood of cardinals were given 24 ozs. of gentles and
16 ozs. of mealworms. This increased quantity, fortified with addi-
tives, and not shared with others resulted in the young cardinals
being larger, and better feathered. They also fledged in exactly 11
days. The departure from the nest was natural, and not inspired by
my intrusion, and in fact the largest of the three flew from the nest
on the 10th day, but returned for the night.
During this nestling period I noticed that spray millet was being
taken to the nest, and was given to the young. Two of this brood
were close-rung on the eighth day, the third being already too far
advanced. There were no foot deformities.
The above report has been written in Madrid, this year, but is
based on comprehensive notes made at the time of breeding which
was actually in 1963. At the time I believed that my success was of
little merit; however, in recent researches into breeding records I find
that this particular species is virtually a " non-breeder ". Pennant
bred it in 1912, and a report appeared in Bird Notes of that year. I
discussed my breeding with Mr. Yealland who was, at the time, the
curator of birds at the London Zoo. I told him that I had seen one
of the cardinals pull a worm from the ground in Blackbird fashion.
This he considered to be worthwhile recording, and commented that
he thought my achievement might be the first since the thirties.
A note on the affair appeared in Gage and Aviary Birds, which
elicited the following reply from P. A. Birch, of Dodford. "... suc-
cessful breeding of Pope Cardinals. It took my mind back to the
early or middle 1930's when my friend L. F. Marshall was also able
to produce at least three strong nests of youngsters in the one breed-
ing season. I think the hen died the following winter.
" Unfortunately none of the young birds moulted into adult plum-
age. In nest feather the young birds' heads were more grey than red.
When the first red feathers appeared all the young died. Although
these birds were provided with a great variety of live food, and soft
food, together with most seeds, and seeding plants, something was
lacking. I hope that Mr. Restall may be more fortunate than my old
friend."
I do not know whether the second brood survived the winter or
not, since my passion for trying something new resulted in me exchang-
ing the whole collection for some other birds.

It seems as though the Pope Cardinal will breed readily under
modest conditions, its needs are certainly not excessive and should not
deter an enthusiast. The first moult may well be a critical period.
Further information is obviously beneficial to all if all breeding
activities are reported, whether successful or not. Information on the
successful or unsuccessful moulting of imported immature birds may
throw some light on the last point.

INTERSPECIFIC ACTIONS OF SEXUAL
SIGNALS AMONG HAND-RAISED WOODPECKERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975323935483871" page_id="56470855"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
By Lawrence Kilham (Dartmouth Medical School,
Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, U.S.A.)
The way a signal, such as a patch of colour in one bird can release
instinctive behaviour in a conspecific has been described by Lorenz
(1970) in his "Companions as factors in the bird's environment."
Noble (1936), in a famous experiment, showed that the black
moustache stripe of the male probably acts as a sexual signal in the
Yellow-shafted Flicker ( Colaptes auratus). Since that time little has
been done with specific sexual signals in woodpeckers as far as I am
aware. From 1957 to 1969, in the course of studies on their life
histories, my wife and I raised nine species of woodpeckers, all from
eastern North America, by hand. Although the actual number of
species varied from year to year they were kept as far as possible in
one aviary.
The placing of varied species together led to a number of unplanned
experiments and as the observations given below were, for the most
part, observed repeatedly and month after month, they are considered
worthy of recording. The most noteworthy of these consisted of the
differing reactions of a male and a female Red-bellied ( Centurus
carolinus) to a lone female Pileated ( Dryocopus pileatus) Woodpecker,
the reactions having been as follows :
Reactions of Red-bellied to Pileated Woodpecker --As detailed in two
previous publications (Kilham 1958, 1961) the courtship of Red-
bellied Woodpeckers is closely associated with a potential nest hole
which, in winter and early spring, consists of an old hole used by die
male for roosting. The male typically calls at dawn, bringing his head
out and down in a manner displaying the feathers of his bright red
crown. His mate then flies to him and the two birds tap together in
mutual tapping. When meeting at other places, the members of a pair
may exchange low, intimate "grr, grr" notes that can be a prelude
to copulatory behaviour. These patterns of behaviour were repeated

almost daily and for many months in the aviary where, in a first year,
a lone female Red-bellied addressed her courtship to a female Pileated
Woodpecker. These two species, in addition to being extremely different
in size, have nothing in common in coloration of body plumage. The
point of similarity between the two thus seemed to be that the Pileated
has a crest of the same sort of silky bright red feathers as are found
on the crown of the male of C. carolinus. The following are examples
of the interspecific behaviour observed in relation to these signals.
Tapping --The female Red-bellied tapped to the Pileated in two types
of situations. In the first of these the Red-hellied might fly to the
Pileated when it was pecking on a log. Such tapping might go on in
repeated bursts for three minutes. The Pileated either paid no attention
or might, occasionally peck at the smaller woodpecker if it came too
close. A second situation and one precipitating even more vigorous
tapping, was when the Pileated flew to its roost hole in a hollow log
nest box, as it did occasionally during the day. The female Red-
bellied would then fly to the side of the hole and start tapping, some-
times moving to get closer to the Pileated as she did so. This tapping
always stopped as soon as the larger bird flew away.
Intimate notes --A second type of behaviour released, it would seem,
in response to the red crest of the Pileated, was when the female Red-
bellied gave low "grr, grr" notes whenever the larger woodpecker
happened to come close.
A few comments should be made on the seeming specificity of these
repeated responses of the female of C. carolinus. In the first place the
aviary contained a variety of other species of woodpeckers all of a
size range much closer to her own. She never, however, courted any
of them as far as I was aware. The other species included at various
times a pair of Yellow-shafted Flickers, four Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers
(Sphyrapicus varius ), and a pair each of Downy ( Dendrocopos pubes -
cens) and Hairy ( D . villosus) Woodpeckers. Another point is that the
reactions were not those of one particular female Red-bellied Wood-
pecker for in a following year a second female, when caged separately
with the Pileated, behaved in an almost identical manner.
Aggressive reactions of a male Red-bellied to the lone female Pileated
Woodpecker ---In a second year I raised another brood of Red-bellied
Woodpeckers which this time included a male The male had assumed
adult plumage by September and by the end of the month he had
become very aggressive. This aggressiveness was directed solely at the
female Pileated, the other species being ignored. He continued to
attack the Pileated over the next year treating it always as if it were
a rival male. The attacks were so persistent that the Pileated remained
in her roost box all day, afraid to emerge. I had, therefore, to keep
the two birds in separate cages much of the time. On May 29th of
the following year the male was feeding young, having mated success-

fully with my original female Red-bellied Woodpecker. When I
placed the female Pileated in an adjacent cage, the male Red-bellied
attacked so persistently that he completely neglected the young he
had been feeding. It thus seemed that both male and female Red-
bellied Woodpecker treated, in their varying ways, the Pileated as a
male of their own species. The female, however, took no further
interest once she had a mate of her own kind.
Reaction of the Pileated to the male Red-bellied Woodpecker --One
form of courtship among Pileated Woodpeckers is for members of a
pair to do bill-waving dances to each other while making "woick,
woick" vocalizations (Kilham 1959). The lone female Pileated per-
formed these displays to the male Red-bellied on two occasions. One
was when the latter had just become adult in plumage, but was still
unaggressive and a second time a month later, when I had put the
Red-bellied in a cage by himself. When replaced into the larger aviary
after a week alone he was quite subdued for several days. During
this time the Pileated again courted him and it seemed from these
two limited episodes that the bright red crest of the male Red-bellied
had released courtship behaviour in the Pileated. It is noteworthy that
in over a year of close proximity, the female Red-bellied had never
released any such response in the larger bird. This suggested that the
Pileated had distinguished clearly between the sexes of C. carolinus.
These responses of the Pileated to the male of C. carolinus were, how-
ever, short-lived. During the remainder of the second year the Pileated's
reactions to the aggressive male of C. carolinus were so overlaid with
fear that it appeared incapable of any other reaction. It should be
noted, in conclusion, that the term red-bellied is a misnomer for
C. carolinus. The red is no more than a light tint and a better name
would have been Zebra-backed Woodpecker.
Reaction of lone Pileated Woodpecker to female but not to male
Yellow-bellied Sapsucker --Sapsuckers, in having black lines radiating
through the eye and from the base of the bill resemble small editions
of D. pileatus from a head-on point of view. This is especially true
of the female sapsucker that, in addition to having a red crown, has
a white throat. She thus bears a resemblance to a male of D. pileatus,
whereas the male sapsucker, with his prominent red throat, does not.
This appeared to explain why the lone female Pileated Woodpecker
courted only one bird in the aviary that contained four other species
of woodpecker. This was a lone female sapsucker and the courting was
over a course of many months. In October of the first year, wanting
to be sure that the sapsucker was serving as the source of his behaviour,
I removed her from the aviary for several days. The Pileated became
quiet immediately and remained so. When I re-introduced the sap-
sucker two days later the Pileated flew to it immediately with crest
raised and giving the most effusive sets of "woicks" and bill-waving

dances that I had yet witnessed as it followed the smaller bird about.
In a second year I had a male as well as female sapsucker. Even
when only the male was left in the aviary, however, the Pileated
Woodpecker never showed the slightest interest in him, thus making
it evident, as in the case of its differing reactions to the male and
female of C. carolinus, that it could differentiate between the sexes
of the sapsuckers as well.

The first description of patches of colour serving as releasers of
sexual behaviour in a woodpecker is that of Noble (1936). Whereas
markings differentiating the sexes in nearly all woodpeckers are bright
red or yellow, neither of these colours function in the sexual differences
of plumage in Yellow-shafted Flickers, the equally bright colours of
the two sexes being an evolutionary problem worthy of continuing
study. The spontaneous experiments observed in the aviary brought
out clearly, it would seem, the importance of bright red as the chief
sexual marker in both C. carolinus and D. pileatus. Unlike Noble's
unrepeated experiment, the aviary experiments were repeated many
times, sometimes daily, in birds that were relatively tame.
An objection might be raised that the situations were artificial. It
can be pointed out, however, that interspecific reactions have been
described in nature, by Tinbergen (1958), for example, for a lone
female Red-necked Phalarope ( Lobipes lobatus ) on her breeding
grounds in Greenland and by Kilharn (1954) in the repeated territorial
attacks of a male Pied-billed Grebe ( Podilymbus podiceps ) on a Ring-
necked Duck ( Aythya collaris) but not on other ducks or waterfowl
that came close to it. The Ring-necked Duck, seen from a distance,
has bill and general body markings of much the same patterns as
those in the grebe.
Among situations most likely to engender interspecific reactions, the
most common is probably a lowering of threshold or motivation taking

place in a lone bird without a mate of its own species. This was true
of my lone female Pileated Woodpecker in the aviary as well as of the
phalarope described by Tinbergen. Added to this, in the case of the
lone female Red-bellied, was that the bright red crest of the Pileated
Woodpecker was about twice as large as that displayed on the crown
of a male C. carolinus . The crest of the Pileated, therefore, may have
thus also acted as a supernormal stimulus (Tinbergen and Perdeck
'OS 0 )-
Another objection that might be raised to present observations on
releasers is that they were not planned as were those of Noble (1936).
Konrad Lorenz (1970), however, in speaking of techniques used in
his studies on "Companions as factors in the bird's environment"
wrote that "The factual data upon which all of the following investi-
tions are based is derived almost entirely from chance observation. I
kept various bird species in an environment as close as possible to
their natural habitat . . .", this latter qualification having also been
true of arrangements made for the woodpeckers in the aviary (Kilham
MS.). One might say in conclusion that much remains to be learned
about releasers of courtship behaviour. For this purpose more than
one avenue of approach should be possible and that of observations on
hand-raised birds, maintained in aviaries, would appear to be far
from exhausted.
N.B.--Since writing the above, the article by Kinsey (1945) on the
nesting of the California Woodpecker (Balanosphyra formicivora) in
captivity has come to my attention. In it, he gives an interesting
description of how a hand-raised male repeatedly attacked red objects
that acted as "releasers".

Tan gar a chrysotis

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995364666666667" page_id="56470860"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
In a short note recently published, Norgaard-Olesen (1973a) men-
tions a display of the Golden-eared Tanager Tangara chrysotis in
which the ear-coverts are raised.
Since studying tanagers under captive conditions, I have observed
five Golden-eared, some of which displayed in the manner described.
In the following article, this particular display is more extensively
described.
The distribution range of the Golden-eared Tanager includes sub-
tropical mountain slopes of the Andes in S. Colombia, E. Ecuador,
Peru and N. Bolivia. Meyer de Schauensee (1970) mentions that it
prefers a forest habitat, but I have been unable to find any further
observations in literature.

The five Golden-eared Tanagers were studied during the period of
1967 to 1973. They lived with a mixed collection of approximately 40
small tanagers (Euphonia and Tangara species), in a well planted and
heated inside aviary connected to a large densely planted outside flight,
to which they had access during summer months (Ingels, 1971).
From 1969 to 1972, I owned two of these birds at the same time : in
the summer months both were often seen together in the undergrowth
of the outside flight, but neither showed any behaviour which gave an
indication as to their sex.
Golden-eared Tanagers are rather shy, and prefer the cover of dense
vegetation. During summer my birds liked to bathe, after which they
would select a warm spot in which to dry and preen their plumage.
These birds would also sunbathe on a well screened perch in the upper
vegetation of the outside flight.
The Golden-eared were given a " normal 55 tanager diet (Ingels,
1971); they appeared to be more insectivorous than most Tangara, and
were very fond of " white 53 mealworms, mealworm and ant pupae.
During periods of activity, they could be seen to hunt amongst the
vegetation for insects, having a special preference for spiders, moths
and small grasshoppers.

In the Golden-eared Tanager, the forehead and eyebrow is glisten-
ing opalescent gold. The crown, lores and a band below the cheeks is
black; the ear-coverts are glistening golden copper. The throat and the
tips of the small black feathers on the sides of the neck are glistening
opalescent golden green.

The species has well defined ear-coverts, made up of slightly
elongated feathers. Distinct ear-coverts or patches on the sides of the
head are found in certain other species: i.e. Chlorochrysa , Tangara ,
Aniso gnat hits; however, no species has been seen to use them in display
as does the Golden-eared.
Ear-covert Display in Singing
Norgaard-Olesen (1973b) describes a male Golden-eared Tanager,
which raised its ear-coverts while singing a hissing, piping song. The
raising of the ear-coverts gave the head a flat and somewhat broad
appearance.
In Disputes with other Tanagers
The behaviour described is not used by all Golden-eared Tanagers,
and as sexual differences are difficult to determine, it has been impos-
sible to ascertain if males only perform the ear-covert display or
whether females also indulge. However, as the birds which display
always appear to be the most active, bold and singing specimens, I
have assumed they were males.
Fig. 1
The display plays an important role during encounters with other
tanagers and is used most frequently in competitive disputes for food,
especially when the Golden-eared is attempting to drive away another
tanager from the feeding shelf. It is also used when the Golden-eared

is threatened by another tanager; however the distance between the
birds has to be less than a foot, before the former will display.
As already mentioned Golden-eared Tanagers are highly insecti-
vorous and because of this are always the first to alight on the feeding
shelf when ant pupae and mealworms are distributed. While feeding,
should another tanager alight nearby, the Golden-eared will usually
take up the following posture: the head is raised until the bill is
almost vertical, the tail may be slightly raised, so as to form a right
angle with the bill. At the same time, the ear-coverts are raised and the
displaying bird utters a series of high-pitched rattling notes (fig. i). The
erected ear-coverts give the head a snake-like appearance (Norgaard-
Olesen, 1973a), when seen from behind or from the front (fig. 2). The
Fig. 2
Snake-like appearance of the head with erected ear-coverts
crown feathers are slightly flattened, but no feather movement on any
other part of the body has been observed. To what extent the ear-
coverts are raised, depends largely upon the aggression of the display-
ing bird. The tanager sustains this display posture as long as no sign of
submission or domination is shown by the opponent.
The dispute may be terminated in two ways :
(i) The alighted tanager feels threatened and flees; the Golden-eared
then ceases to display and continues to feed.
(ii) The alighted tanager takes up an aggressive posture and attacks
the Golden-eared, who immediately ceases to display and leaves
the feeding shelf.
It is possible that light intensity could play an important part in the
display, as under favourable conditions light reflected from the ear-
coverts can help to intensify the brilliance of these feathers.
As Golden-eared Tanagers are rather timid birds, most of their
encounters with other tanagers usually end abruptly with the Golden-
eared fleeing without attempting to display. When the display is used,
it is during encounters with tanagers of approximately equal size only;
larger or smaller species are never displayed to.

The winter of 1972-73 was mild, but the spring cold, which was not
conducive to early breeding, and consequently many birds laid late in
the season and many eggs were infertile.
However, we reared 28 Emus, but only one grey and two white Rheas,
a large number of eggs being laid during the summer, but few proving
fertile. For the first time in many years we had fertile eggs from Sarus
and Demoiselle Cranes, a couple of each being hatched in an incubator
and hand-reared. One Demoiselle Crane chick was destroyed because
of a deformed leg, but the other three, as well as two dark Crowned
Cranes were hand-reared without difficulty. A curious fact is that it is
impossible to associate two crane chicks together in a small brooder, for
they soon start pecking viciously at each other and one or the other
would soon be killed. Before 1940 when our fields had not yet been
contaminated with gape-worm, parent cranes nearly always reared their
two chicks easily, each chick being cared for by a parent at feeding
times and we never had any quarrelling. The dark Crowned Cranes
had a normal clutch of three eggs, but one chick died in the shell.
Tasmanian Waterhens reared ten young in the park where there is
room for six or seven pairs, each pair defending a well defined territory
and if surplus young birds are left there in the spring, they will be
killed by the mated pairs. These rails prove very satisfactory park birds,
as they are hardy, flightless and do not destroy the eggs of other birds;
also they are tame and amusing in their ways. We encountered unfore-
seen difficulties in the rearing of waterfowl and lost a considerable
number of ducklings and goslings which were fed on some turkey-
rearing pellets containing certain ingredients no doubt favourable to
game-birds, but harmful to waterfowl. However, we reared a good

Common Peafowl, 11 Edwards' and many other pheasants--Silver,
Black Kalij, Swinhoe's, Elliot's, Green, Amherst's, Golden (including

It is interesting that the Spreos nest practically all the year round
even in their indoor winter quarters where a number of doves also nest
if afforded enough room and privacy. In fact some species prefer to
nest during the winter months if kept under good conditions.
Our collection of small birds, indoor as well as outdoor, is kept at a
satisfactory level, though new acquisitions are limited by available
accommodation. It is well known that mated birds become highly terri-
torial and often attack companions after several months, or even years,
of peaceful cohabitation. Birds kept isolated, singly or in pairs always
live much longer. We lost recently a Green-billed Toucan which had
lived at Cleres since 1947 and we now have a Guyana Cock of the Rock
which came here over twenty years ago; also five Ruffs and an Oyster-
catcher sent by Copenhagen Zoo in 1946. These waders, of course,
share a large aviary with other birds, but they are not overcrowded.
Sunbirds and humming birds in particular do well only when kept
singly or in a suitable aviary in pairs. Only if the space is considerable
is it practicable to keep more together, but never in large numbers.

During its first full year of operation, the World of Birds proved to
be one of the major attractions of the zoological park. The large simu-
lated habitat exhibits in the new building featuring lush live plantings,
controlled photoperiods and even a daily tropical cloudburst have done
much to capture the imagination of the visitor and seem to have acted
as a stimulant to the bird collection as well. The fact that a number of
species have reproduced in these new surroundings has been of particu-
lar importance since federal restrictions on most bird imports, imposed
during 1972 following outbreaks of exotic Newcastle disease in the
United States, have been continued throughout 1973.
Most notable among the breedings at the World of Birds during 1973
were: 6 Palawan Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron emphanum; 6
Tawny Frogmouths Podargus strigoides and 2 Green Wood-hoopoes
Phoeniculus purpureus, only the second recorded captive breeding for
this species.
Nearly 400 birds were reared in the collection during the year
including: one Caribbean Flamingo Phoenicopterus r. ruber, the
fourth reared here since 1966; one Tufted Puffin Lunda cirrhata, the
second reared here and the only known records for captive propagation
of this species or for the family Alcidae; Red-gartered Coots Fulica
armillata nested successfully for the second year and reared five chicks.
The 1973 hatching results for several species that have been repro-
ducing in the collection on a long-term basis were even more gratify-
ing: 52 Greater Rheas Rhea americana ; 7 White-quilled Black Bus-
tards Afrotis atra afraoides; 6 East African Pratincoles Glareola pratin-
cola fulleborni ; 14 European Avocets Recurvirostra avosetta; 6 Black-
winged Stilts Himantopus h. himantopus and 6 African Spur-winged
Plovers Vanellus spinosus are all included in this category. The bus-
tards represent the only breeding group of this species, or family
Otididae in a New World zoo and three generations of spur-winged
plovers have produced more than 70 chicks here in the last eight years.
The most prolific breeders, in 1973, were a group of Kurrichane
Hemipodes Turnix sylvatica le pur ana. Six female hemipodes laid more
than 430 eggs and 115 chicks were hand-reared by keepers.
Species breeding at the zoo for the first time were : Australian

A number of breeding loans were made to other zoos during the
year, including both unmated specimens and pairs that were progeny
of groups breeding at the zoological park. One example in the former
category was a Philippine Monkey-eating Eagle Pithecophaga jefferyi
that was sent to the Philadelphia zoo as a possible mate for an egg-
laying female in their collection. Because the sex of the Bronx eagle
was not known for certain, a chromosome analysis was made, proving
beyond doubt that the bird was a male. The two eagles are at present
housed in a specially prepared flight with a heated winter shelter,
nesting tree and an observation post with one-way glass for surveil-
lance. Pairs of White-quilled Black Bustards, Tawny Frogmouths, East
African Pratincoles and African Spur-winged Plovers were loaned to
the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., and a pair of Lilford's Cranes
Grus grus lilfordi , was loaned to the International Crane Trust, in
Baraboo, Wisconsin.
Several important breeding loans were made to the collection during
1973 including : a female Costan Rican Quetzal Pharomachrus mocino
costaricensis from the National Zoo; a male South American Condor
Vultur gryphus from the Milwaukee Zoo in Wisconsin and three
Indian Pied Hornbills Anthracoceros m. malabaricus from the Wood-
land Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. The quetzal and the condor are
prospective mates for specimens in the collection here; the hornbills
were hatched and reared at Woodland Park Zoo and it is hoped that
two of die trio will become a future breeding pair.
Declining wild bird populations, complicated procedures and em-
bargos on importation, quarantine restrictions, etc., have all made it
clear that efforts to propagate the birds in our collection are one of our
most important functions.
A grant from a generous donor for the construction of a supple-
mental breeding facility for endangered birds was a giant step in this
direction. Late in the fall of 1973, work was started on a one and three
quarter acre site, adjacent to the World of Birds. Scheduled for com-
pletion early in the spring of 1974, the new off-exhibit compound will
feature nine spacious crane areas, with streams, islands and appropriate
plantings and a heated building with indoor-outdoor flights for
pheasants and small birds.

With the Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis we have had breeding
success for the fourth year now. In 1971 two young were bred, in 1972
six, and in the following year (1973) two were reared. In 1974 already
14 goslings are hatched so that we hope to achieve an excellent breed-
ing result. The eggs this year all belong to one pair. In order to ensure
success, we took the eggs into the incubator. The eggs are of about
78 x 54 mm. and the young were hatched after 30 days. During the
first days they receive a mixture of biscuits, chopped stinging nettle,
different salads, oat flakes and a lime preparation. This mixture is
soaked in milk. After some weeks the young geese receive commercial
chicken food instead of the biscuit. It is especially important to give
them a lot of green food (salad, etc.). Also as adults they need a lot of
green food. We trust that we will continue to have good breeding
results in the future so that we can contribute to the conservation of
this rare species.
Our pair of European Eagle Owls Bubo bubo has hatched again
three young this year. This successful pair has raised a total of 36
young, beginning in 1963. Several of the young birds are given to
institutions for the preservation of nature which try to reintroduce
them to the wild, and we are especially happy that in some cases
re-naturalization has been successful.
Two Olive Pigeons Columba arquatrix have also been hatched.
On 31st December, 1973, living in the Berlin Zoo were 1,064
mammals of 232 species, and 2,820 birds of 752 species. To this are
added 9,616 fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates of 1,416
species in the Aquarium, a stock which no other aquarium can exhibit.

During 1973 there were 270 new arrivals in the Bird Section at
London Zoo. It has been a year when several of the aviaries have had
a face lift, an isolation unit has been set up, many " marriages " have
been arranged and our owl collection had no less than twenty-two
successful hatchings !
The minor reconstructions included " revamping " the aviary which
used to house Budgerigars and which now houses a breeding colony
of Fischer's Lovebirds. The Pheasantry on the North Bank--rewired
and with new doors to the inside shelters--now contains some species
not seen in the Zoo for many years; these include Satyr Tragopans,
Soemmering's Copper Pheasants and Nepal Kalij. The Parrot House
has been rearranged, replanted, given new lighting and been repainted.
The outside aviaries of this House now has potential breeding birds
including a pair of Thick-billed Parrots and a pair of Ruppell's
Parrots. The isolation unit has been set up in the back of the Eastern
Aviary. This conversion will accommodate new arrivals (which do not
have to undergo statutory quarantine) until routine health checks, etc.,
can be carried out and they can be released to the main collection. A
series of small cages which were arranged along one wall of the Bird
House have been removed and a series of new indoor aviaries are being
built which, when completed, will each house a pair of breeding birds.
The Snowdon Aviary has had a number of additions including flocks
of Inca Terns and Spoonbills.
We have introduced new partners for many species, including
Gereopsis Goose, Swinhoe's Pheasant, Hawaiian Goose (the Wildfowl
Trust have kindly deposited a male to join the female we reared in
1972), Wreathed Hombill, Ostrich, Sarus Crane (our female was
widowed and, fortunately proved compatible with the male we intro-
duced from Whipsnade Park).
Arrivals include pairs of Azure-winged Magpies, Trumpeter Horn-
bills, Toucan Barbets, Red and Yellow Barbets, Gaudy Barbets and
African Harrier Hawks.
New species to the Collection include--Pavonine Quetzals Pharo-
machrus pavoninus , Laminated Hill Toucans Andigena laminirostris,
Vermiculated Fishing Owls Scotopelia houvieri, Citron-throated Tou-
can Ramphastos citreolaemus and Jackson's Hornbills Tockus jacksoni.
The pair of Jackson's Hornbills from Kenya have not been seen
here before, and present an interesting enigma. For many years this
species has been the subject of considerable taxonomic debate--is it a
true species, or is it a subspecies or race of the closely related Van der

I 1 8 P. J. OLNEY-REPORT FROM LONDON ZOO
Decken's Hornbill T. deckeni? Is it, as was once suggested, merely a
juvenile stage of Van der Decken's Hornbill? There has been much
confusion in the literature, and in many early works the two have not
been differentiated. It is difficult, therefore, to be clear as to the limits
of their geographical range, though it now appears that there is con-
siderable overlap and they occupy much of the same area of rather
arid bush country and open acacia woodland. Ogilvie-Grant in 1891
was the first to describe T. jacksoni as a separate species, and though
his contention was disputed by other workers, it is now generally
considered that he was correct. Certainly the adults are quite clearly
different: T. jacksoni retains the white spots on the upper wing-coverts
in the adult plumage, whilst T. deckeni does not. The juvenile plumage
of both are said to be virtually indistinguishable. The two birds now
within the collection have distinct white-spotted wing-coverts, are
quite definitely a pair, and are certainly adult. Obviously they are
closely related species, living in the same habitat. Hopefully, further
field work and avicultural practice will solve the problem as to how
they can live in the same area without competing. Possibly it will be
found that they do compete at times; possibly they use the habitat in
different ways, having for instance preferences for different nest-sites
or different foods. The answers could provide clues as to how such
speciation takes place.
A welcome and rare event was the breeding of the Black Kite in the
Southern Aviary. The Knysna Turacos successfully reared two young--
this is a first time in this Collection. Perhaps the most successful of all,
the owls--no less than twenty-two young reared in all. These included
four Snowy Owls, nine Savigny's Eagle Owls and two West African
Wood Owls.
A sad loss was the death with egg peritonitis of one of the female
Congo Peafowl on loan from Antwerp Zoo. More so as the male does
not seem interested in the remaining female.
Finally, during October, a juvenile Gannet was handed in to the
Zoo having been found in London. When we checked it was found
that the bird had been ringed--two months before--700 miles away
in the Shetland Isles !

The quest for the white Ring-necked Parrakeet may never rival that
of Gapt. Ahab for the white whale, but the fact remains that abnorm-
ally coloured birds, other creatures and plants have for long held a
fascination for many, so it might be of interest to report that in the
small zoo at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, there were until recently two
white Little Owls and that Aquila, the journal of the Instituti Orni-
thologici Hungarica contains news of the sighting of a black Little
Egret in Hungary, the fourth European record.

The well-known monthly Gazette contains many advertisements
for the sale of waterfowl and game birds, among them some species of
north American grouse--perhaps bought for releasing rather than for
keeping in aviaries, but if they can be raised artificially, why, one
wonders, are they not kept as aviary birds not only in north America,
but in Europe where one rarely, if ever, sees any of them.

through half-inch mesh wire-netting. Some time ago one of my pairs
hatched a brood of six and at dusk I left the proud parents brooding
the family between them, for the cocks share duties with their hens,
but when I went out soon after dawn, as is my custom, to give the
first feed of the day I found the parents running distractedly about the
aviary and scattered about were the bodies of the chicks. Evidently a
cat had scared the parents during the night and, of course, the young
were too frail to survive without being brooded. I took the bodies with
me to school, for it has always been my habit to show the boys any-
thing of natural history interest, stealing ten minutes or so from the
time allotted to the period--and I may say the standard of work never
dropped for that.
On this occasion I told them of the amazing vitality of baby birds
and cited an instance of reviving an apparently lifeless chick by holding
it in a warm hand and breathing on it. In response to requests of the
class, lots were drawn and the six winners were each given an appar-
ently lifeless quail. To the general amazement five of them one by one
revived and only the sixth was actually dead. The chicks were kept
warm until the morning break when they were reunited with the
parents and all five grew to independence. This anecdote raises the
intriguing question of hibernation in birds. Is this ability to drop into
a state of complete torpor an inheritance from birds' reptilian
ancestors? One learns that, in the short space between the formation of
the embryo and its hatching is condensed the history of millions of
years of evolution. If the embryo of a lizard is compared to that of a
bird of similar size at various stages of development it is hard to see
the difference, the bird embryo having a well developed tail structure
until a quite late stage (see The Origin of Birds by Gerhard Heil-
raann, p. 79). Several of the hummingbirds are capable of living at high
altitudes by becoming torpid at night and so lowering their rate of
metabolism and body temperature. The now famous Poorwill of
North America Phalaenoptilus nuttallii was found by Jaeger hibernat-
ing in bank cavities and rock crevices, practically no heart beat or
breathing being discernible, and this state lasted through three cold
months. I have had some experiences which might point the same way,
for once, as a boy, I found during a sudden snowy and bitter spell in
May some torpid Swifts in a church tower which I kept in a box and
released next day. What about a Swallow which I recorded hawking
for flies in a sun-warmed angle of a cliff at Ramsgate on January 5th,
1925? A hibernating bird? What are the possibilities of transporting
hummingbirds in suitably refrigerated containers?

Writing in the March 1974 Bokmakierie, the journal of the South
African Ornithological Society, Mr. C. J. Skead mentions the Cape
Parrot Poicephalus robustus and its ability to mimic the human voice
and other sounds, which apparently is only done by captive birds, for
he has never heard any attempt at vocal mimicry among the wild ones.
The same is almost certainly true of the Grey Parrot and the hill
mynahs, but on the other hand there are birds such as the robin chats,
mocking birds, lyrebirds and even our Starling among them that do in
the wild mimic the calls of other birds and other sounds. There was a
very talkative mynah in the London Zoo's Bird House that had a
remarkable repertoire, some of which, after a time, it appeared to
forget, or at any rate did not use, but it continued to learn new
expressions from visitors, though never the strident call of a bellbird
that it must have heard thousands of times, nor any other call of birds.

Society may be of real assistance to beginners, we have arranged to
give advice to members upon all matters relating to aviculture by Post.
. . . All letters and questions must be sent to the Secretary, and
contain a stamped envelope for reply. The Secretary will forward the
letters to those Members of the Committee who are best qualified to
deal with the subjects to which they relate, and who are willing to
undertake the task of replying to questions. . . . Those questions and

The Trade in Birds
The greatly increased trade in birds is, in combination with the ever
continuing destruction of habitat, indeed a threat to the very existence
of some species and the position must certainly be worse than either
Mr. Martin or Mr. Frith have indicated, for a factor unknown is the
mortality, particularly among newly caught birds.
In the case of countries where birds are protected, the first course
must surely be to bring pressure to bear on the governments to enforce
their own protection laws and this is best done through the Inter-
national Council for Bird Preservation, a body that can also influence
governments of countries where no bird protection exists. Miss Barclay-
Smith and the British Section can certainly be relied upon to act with
vigour in this field, as has been done by them in the past.
As Mr. Frith says, birds of paradise are not the only species in New
Guinea that are threatened and the crowned pigeons (Gourinae) may
be in even greater danger. His suggestion that possibly some body be
set up to decide which species should, on the ground of rarity, not be
kept in captivity is surely one for very serious consideration as to
practicability, but all would agree with Mr. Martin that more must
be done by aviculturists to breed birds whatever their rarity.
Another factor that must cause the gravest concern is that of disease,
and those who have seen the markets in various tropical places must
have been appalled at the conditions under which livestock is kept,
conditions which cannot fail to generate diseases. When, some forty
years ago, the first ban on the importation of parrots into this country
was imposed because of psittacosis (as ornithosis was then called)
there was some correspondence in the Magazine about it. I said then
that, but for the dealers, psittacosis in parrots would be unknown and
I see no reason to change that opinion now.

The Blue-breasted Banded Rail is about 27 cm. (10^ in.) in length.
It is dark brown above with irregular wavy white bands and spots.
Head and sides of neck are rufous-chestnut; chin and throat white;
foreneck and breast ashy-blue; abdomen and flanks blackish conspicu-
ously barred with white. The bill is partly red, the irides reddish and
the legs olive-green. The female is much duller above and whitish on
the belly. The juvenile has the back streaked with dark brown, the
white bars and spots absent or obsolete; crown and neck rufous-brown,
freely streaked with dark brown. Baker (1922--30) gives the measure-
ments as: Wing 108-131; bill 31-34; tail 38-41; tarsus 34-37 mm.,
and Hume gives the weight as 3.6 to 5 ozs. (c 100-142 grms.). Rallus
striatus ranges from India through Burma and Indo-China to southern
China and southward to Ceylon, Malaya, Java, Sumatra, Celebes and
the Philippines. Several races are recognised.
This rail inhabits swampy areas wherever there is suitably dense
herbage. In India Ali and Ripley (1969) record that it lives from
plain level to 1,300 metres altitude and Henry (1955) states that it
occurs in Ceylon up to 6,000 feet; also that Legge observed it feeding
along the edge of tidal water. I (Timmis 1974) observed two adults
feeding along the edge of a paddy (rice) field near Besuki, southern
Java, in February 1973. They appeared to be eating aquatic insects
and on approach they moved into thick sedge near the paddy field.
The local name for this rail was Alap-alap, and although it is said to
be usually silent, I found that one of the two that I drove into the
sedge was quite noisy, calling " Ka-ka-ka."
Local people said that this rail was not uncommon in the vicinity
of their village. The population of rails in an area is considerably larger
than inferred from the few individuals one happens to see. Shy and
secretive, they seldom allow one more than an occasional, usually
unsatisfactory, glimpse; yet on occasions they seek food openly among
the rice fields, or emerge boldly at the edge of a village or on a muddy
trail. When flushed they fly poorly, with dangling legs, before dropping

into a convenient clump of vegetation. They are seldom flushed a
second time. They eat snails, insects and small green seeds. One
stomach was crammed with the remains of almost twelve iridescent
green beetles, Galstaun (pers. comm.).
Captive Breeding
A pair of Rallus striatus were purchased on the 23rd April, 1973,
the pair being selected from a small group imported from Bangkok
several weeks earlier. Both birds appeared to be in very good condition.
Body weights: $ 132; $ 120 gms.
Measurements: $ Wing, from the carpal joint to the tip of the longest
primary, 132 mm. Bill length, from tip of upper mandible to first
feathers of forehead, 33 mm. Tarsus, from notch behind upper end to
joint between middle toe and front of tarsus, 36 mm. Tail, from
between bases of central tail feathers to tip of longest feather, 42 mm.
$ Wing 129; bill 31; tarsus 35; tail 40 mm.
After a veterinary examination, during which the faeces were
checked for parasitic burdens and enteric pathogens, the rails were
released into an outside aviary measuring 18 ft. long X 8 ft. wide X
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.622875272727273" page_id="56470883"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
6 ft. high. This had been planted specially in an attempt to breed the
rails, two-thirds of the flight being heavily planted with Mat Grass
( Nardus strict a), Meadow Foxtail ( Alopecurus pratensis) and clumps
of Hard Grass ( Sclerochloa dura), together with several small trees
and shrubs--mainly Alder ( Almus glutinosa) and White Birch ( Betula
alba). Fast growing creepers were planted along the wire and near to
some of the shrubs to give good cover. A concrete pool measuring
36 in. across and about 6 in. deep was built and surrounded with rushes
and sedge, these being identified as Soft Rush ( Juncus effusus), Com-
mon Rush (/. subuliforus), Hard Rush (/. inplexus), and Bulrush
(1 Scirpus lacustris). The remaining area was covered with river sand.

Two hollow logs, 6 ft. in length, were laid on the aviary floor and
covered at both ends with fast growing creeper to allow extra cover
for hiding, etc.
The rails were introduced into the aviary on the 25th April, 1973 :
they appeared to settle down almost at once and began feeding on a
mixture of minced meat, boiled egg, carrot, rice, insect mixture and
biscuit meal. They were also given live house flies, beetles, mealworms
and maggots dusted with Super Hydramin powder (Neon Corporation).

<bodyText confidence="0.966448166666667" page_id="56470883"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Preening is a constant occupation, a great deal of time being spent
in settling and oiling the feathers. The bird touches the oil gland at the
base of the tail and then rubs the bill over primaries, breast and tail
feathers. The side of the head is rubbed over the wing-coverts and the
bill poked repeatedly through the breast feathers, after which a long
time is spent in energetic scratching by the right foot under the chin

and about the face, terminated with a final ruffling and settling of the
feathers.
Bathing is observed daily. The rail walks into the shallow pool,
drinks, and then sits and rolls over on to one side, raising the upper
wing away from the body with the manus still generally folded against
the forearm. Then, with one side of the face in the water, the rail
throws droplets onto the back with a posteriorly directed head move-
ment. After a dozen or so more movements, the bird turns over on to
the other side and repeats the process. On occasions the rail bathes in
a standing position, ducking the head and chest in the water and flap-
ping both wings, which sends water spray all over the entire body. After
bathing it spreads out the tail feathers, droops the wings and then struts
about until quite dry again.
Dust bathing was recorded twice and took place in a sandy corner
of the flight during very hot weather. The birds made scraping motions
with their feet and loosened the hard-packed sand by probing with
their bills. They settled down in the freshly made depression with a
sidewise body movement. Then, with slightly extended wings and
fluffing out of the chest feathers, they inserted the bill into the sand,
first to one side of the body and then to the other, the sand being swept
on to the wings and back. This behaviour went on for about six
minutes.
Sunning has been observed on most hot days. The bird simply leans
on one side and wing with the other wing fully extended for several
minutes. This is done on the ground and also from a perch.

Roosting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981498631578947" page_id="56470884"  page_num="127" year="" vol="">
The rails never sleep in the grass or sedge, but always choose the
highest perches, the same roosting site being used night after night,
and both birds roost quite close together. Short periods of dozing have
been observed in the middle of the day. The individual dozes in a
standing position, gradually retracting the neck, raises one leg and
erects the body feathers. In this position it dozes for periods varying
from three to four minutes to eight or nine minutes. On occasions,
however, the rails remain on both feet or sometimes they sit in the
shade of a shrub.
They appear to be nocturnal to a certain extent, as twice on moon-
lit nights I have found them walking about, feeding and bathing.
Feeding
Almost all food items are picked up from the ground but some
insects and seeding grasses are taken by jumping from a standing posi-
tion or by perching on the vegetation. They prey upon many kinds of
insects, especially beetles, spiders, woodlice and ants. Sometimes they
simply pick up and swallow the insects or may peck repeatedly at
active insects regardless of size. Large insects, such as adult locusts, are
taken in the bill and beaten against the ground or a log before being

<bodyText confidence="0.980802666666667" page_id="56470885"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
swallowed. The rails also probe the aviary floor for earthworms and
insect larvae, especially when the sandy soil is damp from recent rain.
When an earthworm is found, it is shaken very vigorously with a side-
wise motion of the head, then jabbed before finally being swallowed.
Leaves and grasses are picked up or swept aside with the bill while the
birds are looking for food, but I have never seen the feet used in the
search for food.
Occasionally they catch an adult mouse which, after shaking and
stabbing, they drown in the pool, but the mice are never eaten.
Anting
This interesting behaviour has been observed twice. Red Wood Ants
Formica rufa which had been placed in the adjoining aviary, contain-
ing a pair of Red-rumped Green Woodpeckers Ficus erythropygius
nigrigenis, were picked up by the rails as several passed the aviary
wire-netting. The rails continued picking up the ants until they had
about fifteen in their bills. Some of these were swallowed and others
placed among the feathers. The beak, whilst holding an ant, was
rubbed among the wing, breast, rump and tail feathers and the head
was rubbed against the underside of the wings and the tail.
Display
Courtship display occurs while the rails are standing and is per-
formed by either sex; occasionally by both birds at the same time. They
stand in a slightly bent forward position, with the neck outstretched
and the wings held at right angles to the body. In this position they
sway slowly from side to side, lifting first one foot and then the other.
The male, when ready to mount, walks up to the female and attempts
to get behind her. She, on most occasions, turns to face him. He then
starts to circle her and she keeps turning away as he circles. The male
at this stage is erect and stiff, an attitude similar to the aggressive
posture seen with the Weka Rails when two birds confront each other
(Timmis 1972). While circling, he frequently emits a low " Kuk-kuk-
kuk ". When the female is sufficiently motivated, she sits, permitting [
the male to mount. Treading occurs only for several seconds as the
male secures his balance. As soon as the male mounts, the female moves
her head and neck from side to side in a very jerky manner and this
normally continues as long as the male remains on her back. After a
mounting the male extends his wings so that the primaries touch the
ground and raises his tail which is followed by fluffing out the body
plumage. Copulations are frequent through the initial nest-building
period.
Courtship feeding has been observed on several occasions. The male
picks up a mealworm or insect and at the same time emits a low
" Ka-ka-kaa-kaa This causes the female to stop whatever she is
doing and run up to the male who, after passing the food item, pro-
ceeds to circle and often tries mounting--obviously this form of court-

ship display feeding is to induce the female to approach the male for
mating and also it must strengthen the pair bond.
Nest-building
Contrary to previous reports (Salim Ali &amp; Ripley op, cit.), during
nest-building, the male appeared to do most of the material gathering
(usually bits of rush, grass and sedge), while the female remained on
the nest site. When actively building, the male often made as many as
ten trips per hour with material, which were followed by periods of
standing on or near the nest, preening and resting. While the male was
busy collecting grass, etc., the female, except for occasional trips to
gather material, usually remained on the nest, receiving the stems from
the male and working these into the structure. The nest was con-
structed in just under four days : it was a flat platform of grass, rush
and sedge stems, approximately 30 cms. across, with a very slight
depression in the centre which contained a few bits of moss and several
small green leaves. It was built in the centre of a very thick clump of
Scirpus lacustris, about four or five inches from the ground and well
concealed from all sides.
Incubation
The first egg was laid on the 2nd August, 1973, and, as with the
larger Weka Rail ( Gallirallus australis greyi), incubation commenced
with the first egg. Like the Weka, Rallus striatus is a likely egg-eater
in captive conditions and it is certain that if incubation began only
when the clutch was completed, there would be no eggs left. Because
of the difficulties of daily nest checking, it was not possible to deter-
mine when the remaining eggs were laid. However, piecing together
random observations by myself and members of the bird staff, it is
reasonably certain that subsequent eggs were produced over a period
of four days, and six completed the clutch.
Both birds took part in incubation, although the female appeared
to spend more time on the nest than the male. In this species there
was no display at the change-over when one bird relieved the other at
brooding. The eggs were turned by the sitting bird at varying times
during the day and night and on most occasions after the eggs had
been turned (with beak and leg movement), the bird also turned around
to face another direction in the nest. The eggs hatched on the 28th
August, exactly 22 days from the laying of the last.
It is often difficult to decide how much the eggs have been incubated
during the laying period and, for this reason, incubation periods are
best calculated from the laying of the last egg to the hatching of the
last young. Even when the adult bird is observed sitting on the eggs
frequently, or for long periods, in the egg-laying period, this does not
necessarily mean that the eggs are being subjected to full incubation
heat (Swanberg 1950).
Four chicks left the nest soon after hatching and followed both

parents about the aviary, keeping to well defined runs amongst the
thick vegetation. They were brooded at intervals, wherever they hap-
pened to be. If any kind of danger threatened, the adults immediately
ran away from them, deliberately attracting attention to themselves.
The chicks remained in a cluster for a few seconds and then scattered
in all directions, concealing themselves under grass and shrubs so well
that we found it practically impossible to locate them. They were able
to run very fast but on the few occasions when one or two of them were
caught in the open, they immediately flattened themselves to the
ground and remained absolutely motionless.
A fifth chick did not leave the nest and was found dead an hour or
so after hatching. This was preserved for future study. One egg did not
hatch. This measured 34.7 X 25.4 mm. and was creamy-white, very
smooth in texture with a slight gloss and heavily blotched and spotted
with reddish-brown and purplish-brown, most of the blotching being at
the broad end. Natal down was jet black with a very faint greenish
gloss above and below. Measurements of newly hatched chick : wing
21.7, upper mandible 10, lower mandible 8.5, body length 80 mm.
Both parents fed the chicks, almost all the food being carried in the
tip of the bill. When the food item was a mealworm, it was always
carried so that it projected forward from the tip of the beak. While a
chick was taking food from the parent, it emitted a very low whistle,
and quite often after swallowing food it wiped its bill vigorously
against the ground or grasses several times. On occasions when the
food items were not picked up by the parents, they appeared to move
their heads in an up and down movement to attract the chicks to the
food or dabbled with food, often to break it into small pieces. Maggots,
mealworms, earthworms, spiders and numerous insects were collected
and fed by the adults, as were an occasional number of seeds from
seeding grasses. Large quantities of insects were provided daily for
the first week, as the chicks seemed to be reared primarily on live food
during this period.
During the first seven days I never once saw the chicks picking up
food themselves. However, after the eighth day they started to peck at
most objects, edible or not on the aviary floor. They approached any
strange object in a very slow and cautious manner. If an object was
edible, one chick picked it up and ran for cover, usually pursued by
the others.
At two months old they were the same size as the parent birds but
much darker in colour and did not show as many white spots and bars.
At five months they were identical to the parents, except for the legs
which were slightly darker in colour. The four chicks proved to be
three males and one female.

Ara rubrogenys
By rolando romero d. (Santa Cruz, Bolivia)
The Red-fronted Macaw is found in a small valley within the district
of Cochabamba, Bolivia, and nowhere else in South America. I saw
this bird for the first time in 1970, but did not then pay much attention
to it, thinking it might be a hybrid between the Military A. militaris
and the Blue and Yellow Macaw A. ararauna. As described by Mr.
Halford, the body colour is mainly pale green; the forehead, crown,
ear-coverts, shoulders, under wing-coverts and thighs are orange-red;
the tail red and blue and the bill black. It was a surprise to me to see
a skin in the British Museum (Natural History) in December 1970 and
Mr. David Holyoak pointed it out to me as one of the rarest of the
macaws : I recognised it as the species I had seen earlier that year. I
spent almost three years in trying to locate a wild population and the
valley where the only known wild specimens live is difficult and
dangerous to reach, for it is approached by a narrow road on which
our jeep more than once very nearly slipped over the side and down
into a river some 600 feet below. In this valley we saw a few Red-
fronted (or Red-cheeked) Macaws and found that they feed on corn,
cactus fruits, " ceibo " (Erythrina cristigalli) " chanara " and other
fruits. The valley is at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and is
no more than about 1,000 square kilometres in extent, the plant life
being of a xerophytic nature. We saw the birds almost always in pairs
and it is very unusual to find them in groups of more than twelve. The
only readily discernible difference in the sexes is one of size. The
young are entirely green on leaving the nest, the orange-red appearing
about a year later. The people of the valley kill the macaws for their
tail feathers and for food, so that the species must be in danger of
extinction.

THE NORTH AMERICAN RUDDY DUCK IN CAPTIVITY

By Richard Mark Martin (Kent's Bank, Cumbria)
The North American Ruddy Duck Oxyura jamaicensis jamaicensis
is the most commonly kept member of the twelve forms which com-
prise the tribe Oxyurini, but even so, one usually has to visit a specialist
collection in order to see it.
The Oxyurini or stiff tails are among the most interesting of water-
fowl. They are principally New World birds, but there are species in
Africa, Australia and one--the White-headed Duck O. leucocephala is
found in Asia and southern Europe. The North American Ruddy Duck
breeds in central North America and winters south to Mexico, and is
also resident in the West Indies.
This enchanting little bird is from 35 to 43 cm. long and is almost
circular in appearance. It is a highly aquatic species, seldom venturing
on to land, is largely nocturnal, and spends most of the day swimming
round in haphazard circles--asleep--which it accomplishes by infre-
quent paddles of one foot. In breeding dress the male is mainly rufous
with a black head, large white cheek patches and a sky-blue bill. The
female is cryptically coloured brown and in winter the male moults
into an eclipse plumage, at which time he resembles the female apart
from his retention of the white cheek patches.

Being essentially aquatic, North American Ruddy Ducks' first re-
quirement is an extensive amount of fresh water to a depth of about
2 m. They are very fond of diving and thus obtain most of their food
and exercise. As they are normally kept in company with other water-
fowl--all of which may be more terrestrial in inclination--they are
usually, as a matter of course, retained by a predator-proof fence.
Although they themselves will be safe from overland attacks, they may
be susceptible to attacks from such creatures as Mink Mustela vison.
Indeed, apart from rare observance of ruddy ducks resting on the
extreme edge of the water, the only other time when I have seen them
on land is when nesting.
Diet
Ruddy ducks are predominantly vegetarian--ingesting various plant
materials, such as pondweeds, sedges and the seeds of other water
plants; insects, crustaceans and molluscs are also consumed. In cap-
tivity, kept on natural or well-matured lakes they can find most of their
own food, but in more sterile ponds they will live on the usual duck
fare (two feeds daily) and require no special treatment.
Breeding
Copulation takes place on the water after elaborate display. Mock
fights between males are common but no physical contact takes place.
The main display involves the male circling the female with his head
erect and tail vertical; the neck is inflated, and this is beaten by his
bill so as to emit a dull, hollow tapping sound. This progressively
becomes faster as the display reaches its climax; small bubbles appear
on the water caused by the expulsion of air from within the neck
feathers. The display finishes with the thrusting of the head along the
surface of the water and the sudden deflation of the air sac causing
a low croaking sound.
An untidy nest in thick cover is constructed as near the water as
possible, often on a pile of reeds. Sometimes there is an improvised
slipway from the nest into the water affording the incubating duck a
quick escape should danger threaten, for on land they can only move
with great difficulty. The eggs are white (becoming stained) and thick-
shelled; they are astonishingly large: 64 mm. X 46 mm. An average
clutch comprises 8-14 eggs, although I knew one duck who laid no
less than 20.
During incubation, the eggs become tiered in the nest as this is the
only way in which they can all be covered. They are periodically
shuffled around, of course.
Both parents are extremely pugnacious in defence of their brood--
driving away much larger creatures than themselves. As soon as dry,
the almost jet-black ducklings can swim and dive almost as well as
their parents; they resemble great hairy water beetles as they skate

about the surface. They are in all ways highly precocious and are
tremendously difficult to catch for pinioning operations. This has
resulted in several feral populations becoming established especially
in the south of England. Such environments as flooded gravel-pits
favour them ideally.
Despite their independence, mortality is high amongst ducklings.
In the wild, pike Esox Indus and harriers Circus spp. account for a great
number. The drake stays near the nest during incubation which lasts
for about 24 days, and assists in the rearing. The young birds soon
become independent of both parents--even before they are fledged.
A supplementary diet for the young appears unnecessary providing
there is plenty of aquatic plantlife, especially duckweed Lemna minor
available.
Artificial Hatching and Rearing
As opposed to the majority of waterfowl, stiff tails present many
problems in the artificial rearing of their offspring. This should only be
attempted as a last resort : ducklings are seldom deserted by their
parents even if it may appear so. Occasionally, however, one will find
eggs laid well away from nests, perhaps in a clump of rushes or in
shallow water, and these can be " sat " under a broody bantam or hen
in the usual way.
I incubated six abandoned eggs under a broody hen with a fair
amount of success. Having regard to the inevitably moist condition of
a natural stiff tail nest, I endeavoured to increase the humidity of the
nest by frequent applications of water to the eggs by lightly spraying
them twice a day. After the due term of incubation, four ducklings
hatched, the remaining two eggs being infertile.
The four ducklings were removed to an indoor coop measuring
51 x 15 x 46 cm. For the first few days an infra-red lamp was
suspended above them to maintain a temperature of 35*C. Although
the foster mother was also retained the ducklings did not accept her,
and appeared very nervous and highly-strung. The foster mother was
soon removed as she became a liability.
Three of the ducklings died at progressive intervals, the first as late
as on the ninth day. A great variety of food was offered : the most
popular items were maggots and mealworms which were consumed
avidly, as was aquatic live food; they were also seen to eat finely
chopped lettuce, Lemna minor and Turkey Starter Crumbs. The live
food was laced with Adexolin to the rate of one drop per day per bird
(approximately 400 units of Vit. A; 40 units of Vit. D and 1 mg. of
Vit. C).
Without doubt the most important aspect of the rearing process is
the need for a constant supply of water. The ducklings like to be able
to get thoroughly wet but must also be allowed to dry again quickly.
This may necessitate replenishing the water hourly, as at the younger

stages of growth they should only be given shallow supplies (no deeper
than 4 cm.). They deteriorate quickly if deprived of this most important
part of their natural habitat.
The infra-red lamp was retained but at decreasing temperatures
until the duckling was fledged. It never learnt to accept me, which was
saddening, and was no tamer on the day of its release than on the day
of hatching. Until independence, it continued to receive the manu-
factured crumbs and live food in addition to green food of one sort or
another.

By paolo bertagnqlio (Torrimpietra, Rome)
I have been asked by the Italian league for bird preservation to try
to breed the Great Eagle Owl Bubo b. bubo , for this species is near to
extinction in Italy and the league is anxious to reintroduce it in suit-
able habitats. A male and two females were obtained in January 1973
from a private collection where they had been since 1965. No eggs had
previously been laid by them, so I was surprised when, in March, one
of the hens nested and laid two eggs on the ground in the corner of the
flight. The eggs were infertile and so far the birds have not nested
again.
Of the lories and lorikeets in my aviaries, a pair of Yellow-backed
Domicella g. flavopalliata which have been breeding since 1967 had a
single nest, rearing two chicks. A second pair consisting of an imported
male and a daughter of pair 1 reared two young from two nests and a
third made up of a son of pair 1 and a daughter of pair 2 reared four
young from two nests. Pairs 2 and 3 share the same aviary 7 and two nest
boxes are fixed inside the shelter.
A pair of Black-capped D. 1 . lory nested for the first time and two
eggs were laid, the embryos dying when nearly ready to hatch, due
perhaps to too dry conditions. A pair of the Red Lory Eos borne a
hatched two chicks in July, but they died when respectively eleven and
seventeen days old. The mother is unable to fly because of having had
one wing pinioned at some time, so she could only reach the nest by
means of a long branch leading up from the ground to the nesting hole,
so I suspect that mice may have disturbed the birds at night, gaining
access to the nest by the same route. Two more chicks were hatched in
mid-November, but when they were two weeks old, the branch some-
how became dislodged and I did not notice it, so the result was that the
mother was unable to get into the box that night and the chicks, which
were well nourished and in perfect condition, died from the cold.
Schildpad's Violet-necked Lory Eos s. attenua of which I have a
pair, hatched two chicks in May. One soon died and the other did not
appear to be thriving so, at a little more than two weeks old, I put it
into the nest of Ornate Lorikeets who had a rather older chick of their

own and they reared both perfectly. In 1972 the same pair of Violet-
necked bred successfully on rather a colonial system, another pair of
E. squamata and an Edwards' Lorikeet sharing the same aviary. Early
in 1973, in order to make room for some parrots, I moved the breeding
pair of Violet-necked to a small flight about 3 metres long, and this
was surely a mistake.
The male has red irides and dark blue under tail-coverts; the female
brown irides with brick-red outer edges, while her under tail-coverts
are a mixture of purplish-blue, greenish and reddish, all rather pale,
but whether these characters represent true sexual dimorphism or only
individual variations I cannot say. A second pair of the Ornate Lori-
keets Trichoglossus ornatus, the male a son of pair 1 (two years old)
and the female an imported bird nested but the eggs were infertile,
due presumably to the young age of the male.
Swainson's Lorikeets T. h. moluccanus reared two chicks from two
nests and a second pair raised three from two nests. Western Green-
nap ed T. h. berauensis reared two from one nest.
Early in 1973 I obtained a three-year old male Rose-breasted Cocka-
too Kakatoe roseicapilla for my old female. Four eggs were laid, but
all proved infertile, perhaps due to the young age of the male and to
the short time that the two had been together. Citron-crested Cocka-
toos K. s. citrinocristata nested, one infertile egg being laid. I have two
Spectacled Amazon Parrots Amazona a. nana, one with red greater
wing-coverts (but green alula) and the other with no red at all on the
wings. Both laid (a total of eight eggs) and sat side by side in the box
for over a month. This confirms that it is on the colour of the bastard
wing that this species can be sexed.
A pair of Pallid Caiques Pionites m. pallida hatched four from four
eggs. Two chicks died early but the other two were successfully reared.
Three Lesser Patagonian Conures C. p. patagonus were hatched, two
being reared by the parents and the third, because of its noticeably
smaller size, was hand-reared. I keep some Australian parrakeets, not
(with a few exceptions) because of any particular interest in them, but
because the young are good exchange material. My pair of Pale-headed
Rosellas Platycercus a. palliceps, the male of which is of an unusual
" pied " appearance, reared a single chick and one pair of Golden-
mantled P. e. ceciliae reared three and a second pair which I have had
since 1965 were for the first time double-brooded, rearing three and
four chicks.
Lastly, my pair of Red-capped or Pileated Parrakeets P. pileata
reared four young from four eggs. Incubation lasted 25-26 days and
the young remained in the nest for seven weeks. Three of these young,
on leaving the box were noticed to have thin red frontal bands, while
the fourth (obviously a female) showed in the same area a scarcely
perceptible bluish wash. This fact does not agree with the common

belief that in the juvenile plumage both sexes have completely green

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime, France)
I had the pleasure of paying a visit to Mr. Charles Sivelle at
Huntingdon Station, Long Island, early in March 1974. I had been
there a few years ago, and I was delighted to see how much his
collection of pheasants had increased and improved : it is probably
now the finest in the world. There are some acres of grounds devoted
to a number of large, well planted pens, about half of which have
ample indoor accommodation, slightly heated for tropical species.
They are disposed in several units, well planned and well kept, and
there are various installations for the incubation of eggs and rearing
of chicks.
Although Mr. Sivelle also keeps a few other game birds, waterfowl
and cranes, pheasants constitute the bulk of his collection. Few of the
commoner species are kept, but there are often several pairs of the
rarer ones.
We first find several pairs of Koklass ( nipalensis ) and Blood Pheasants
Ithaginis emeritus (both species reared young last year) as well as Satyr
and Temminck's Tragopans. There are also two pairs of White Eared
Pheasants ( drouyni) and an imported pair of pale grey ones which I
believe to be the rare Crossoptilon c. dolani. Mikado and three forms
of copper pheasant--Ijima's, Soemmering's and Scintillating are pre-
sent and breeding; also Edwards' and a few other more ordinary
species. The aviaries are heavily shaded by trees and creepers during
the summer, which can be very warm on Long Island, although not
as hot as it sometimes is inland in that part of north-east America.
Koklass, tragopans and blood pheasants, although living in the wild
state high up on mountains where it is always cool, appear, however,
to prosper under such conditions.
More delicate species inhabit a long double row of pens connected
with adequate shelters in a large central house with roomy heated
compartments on each side of a central corridor. One finds there a
dozen pairs of Malay and Bornean Argus which produce many young;
different firebacks, including Lesser Bornean and Malay Crestless, and
four magnificent pairs of Bulwer's. The latter have not yet started
laying, but they are well acclimatised and in excellent condition. There
are also many Grey, Germain's and Palawan Peacock Pheasants. Mr.

Sivelle has moreover been very successful with Roulrouls, Tree Par-
tridges A. torqueola and the bustard-quail Turnix sylvatica which
breed freely. Large fenced spaces between the groups of aviaries are
the home of peafowl, males of Golden, Amherst's and other commoner
pheasants and of crowned cranes. In another part of the grounds a
very large wired-over pen with an extensive pool has been almost
completed and will soon accommodate a collection of the smaller water-
fowl.
Mr. Sivelle's collections are ever increasing and improving. Many of
his rarer birds have been privately captured and there is no doubt that
his establishment is one of the most important to-day, highly significant
for the propagation and conservation of vanishing species of game
birds.

on the flanks in front of the tibiae. The violet becomes darker, indeed almost black, on the hindermost
parts of the abdomen; about the anal aperture there are some crimson feathers and the tibiae are crimson
in front and on either side. The inferior tail coverts are fundamentally violet, but shot with green. The
forehead is dark red. The sides of the head and the chin are of a shining very dark violet with crimson
markings. The nape and the base of the neck are also violet fundamentally, but the middle and terminal
margins of the feathers are of a clear brownish grey, which appear lilac in certain lights. Such greyish
lilac shades may extend themselves to the scapulars, the hinder parts of which become of an intense
maroon colour, as also the posterior part of the back. The lesser upper wing coverts are of a uniform dark
brown, but the median and the larger wing coverts become maroon coloured, especially the more
internal ones a shade of dark green shows itself in certain lights on some of these and extends to the more
external secondaries, to the primary coverts and to the primaries themselves. The more internal second-
aries have their apices tinted with a dull yellowish olive, especially upon the internal webs. The rump is
of a clear violet blue, bordered by dark violet, passing into a greenish tint. The rectrices are, above, of
a dark purple-red towards their base and of a violet lilac colour for the rest, except their apices, which

are a yellowish green. The three external tail feathers have their internal webs, towards the base of each,
of a bright carmine-red, but this colour extends but a short way. The undersurface of the tail is bright
carmine-red at the base of the feathers and then a darker red, but greenish yellow towards the ends of
the feathers. The undersurface of the tail, so looked at that the rays of light fall at a very acute angle,
shows vivid shades of gold colour and purple red. The inferior wing coverts are of the same carmine-red
as the tibiae; the more external ones, towards the margins of the wing, are more violet. The larger remiges
are brownish black, with the basal half of the internal web of a red colour, but less intense than that of
the coverts.

Aviculture
In the 1925 (vol. 31) avicultural magazine, a letter from Wilfred
Frost mentions a single Red-quilled Lory. This example performed
tricks and talked (a fairly uncommon accomplishment among lories)
and as Frost states that this was the only bird of this species that he
had ever encountered in twenty years spent in New Guinea and the
East Indies, it would seem to be rare or local. This specimen was sub-
sequently brought by Frost to Britain in 1927, but it died shortly after
arrival.
I can find no earlier accounts of this species being imported alive
into Europe.
In 1942, Dr. Alan Lendon, writing in the avicultural magazine
mentioned a single Raja Lory in the collection at the Cairo Zoo.
I know of no breeding in captivity of this species.

Bearing in mind the scanty material available for this lory, it would
be imprudent to make any dogmatic statements concerning the validity
of its current specific status. However, judging from the live specimen
and from colour plates, the similarity to Chalcopsitta atra is quite
pronounced, the only distinction being the increased amount of red.
As I mentioned in my notes dealing with atra , examples of that species
vary infinitely in the amount of red flecking they possess, consequently
it would seem to be somewhat capricious to award insignis full specific
status on such slight and variable grounds. I would suggest that it be
revised to Chalcopsitta atra insignis , although more detailed research
may prove even this classification unworkable, if examples of all of the
intermediate stages between this and the typical all black atra atra are
are shown to exist. The only factor which could provide an easy means
of distinguishing the Raja from the Black Lory is the coloration of the
under wing-coverts, which in the latter are black whereas those of the
Raja are red; this feature seems less likely to vary.

Avicultural rarities which one longs to possess sometimes, on acquisi-
tion, turn out to be not so interesting after all. However, this is not
true of my Slender-billed Parrakeet or Conure Enicognathus lepto-
rhynchus. A year after the death of its former owner, Mrs. N. Howard
of Godsall Wood, Mr. Howard telephoned me to tell me that he was
considering parting with the bird. He had promised that I should have
first refusal but there was no question of refusing a bird I had coveted
for years!
The following weekend my husband and I drove up to Wolverhamp-
ton to collect the Slender-bill. It was in immaculate condition with a
glossy sheen to its plumage which is most striking. Until this bird
became mine, I had not realised just how beautiful its plumage is.
Mainly dark olive-green, the centres of all the feathers are faintly
tinged with maroon and the whole of the underparts are mottled with
maroon; on the abdomen, there is a large patch of this colour. In a
photograph of this bird taken several years ago (which appears in my
book the parrots of south America) the colour is not as extensive on
the upper breast, so it would appear that it increases with age. The

upperside and the underside of the tail are an iridescent maroon,
reminiscent of that of some Pyrrhura conures.
The crown is broadly barred with black and these feathers are raised
giving them extra prominence when the bird is excited. The short
feathers of the forehead and lores--which remind one of those of a
Military Macaw Ara militaris --are dark red. They cover the cere and
the nostrils. The feathers surrounding the eyes are also dark red and
the peri-orbital skin is greyish-white. Orange is the colour of the iris.
The upper mandible is a dark horn colour, almost black, and the
lower mandible is light horn-coloured.
For once I was not sorry that the lack of an empty aviary prevented
me from placing the Slender-bill outside. He had always been caged,
was quite tame and appreciated attention--excuses enough to keep
him in the most lived-in room in the house. The day after collecting
him I opened the cage door and he soon climbed out and sat on top.
After a brief flight around the room--initiated by overbalancing when
he climbed down and stood on a dish on the table---he was returned
to his cage by the simple procedure of putting a towel round him.
Most parrots object in the strongest terms known to them at such an
injustice---but not this one. He lays in a towel on his back, making
no attempt to struggle and presenting a highly comical sight!
Let out daily for an hour or so, by the end of the first week he had
become so familiar that when I sat at the table writing, he would
approach and attempt to remove my pen. When preparing the list of
coloured plates for the Avicultural Society, I indexed each plate
using a card; the Slender-bill found much amusement in picking up
the cards and flinging them on the floor, leaning over the edge of the
table to watch their progress downwards. Before I had had him two
weeks he sometimes attempted to " feed " my hand, pumping his
head but not actually regurgitating; thus I felt he was probably a
male. After three weeks he would land on my shoulder and snuggle
against my neck and preen my hair.
This bird eats anything offered, but sunflower seed and fruit form
the mainstay of his diet. Apple, orange, celery, carrot, cabbage, cheese,
toast and treacle tart are all speedily dispatched.
I should put on record, for the taxonomist, that he sometimes holds
food in the foot and sometimes holds it " tether-footed " (clasped to the
perch). He scratches directly (under the wing). He is such an enthusi-
astic bather that I have to remember not to fill his water container
too full or the vicinity of his cage is soon drenched.
The sight of the mealworm tin has the same effect on this bird as it
does on most softbills. He eats the insects in the same manner as a
softbill--but more rapidly---squeezing out the inside and leaving the
skin. I wonder whether, in the wild, the long bill is ever used to extract
wood-boring insect larvae from trees?

The Slender-billed Parrakeet is a native of Chile where it inhabits the
central third of the country from Aconagua to Llanquihue. It is said
to feed on wild and cultivated plants, including thistles and wheat, and
to do considerable damage to cultivated crops. It also feeds on the
seeds of the Araucaria pine.
As very few birds are exported from Chile, this parrakeet is almost
unknown in aviculture. I believe that Sir Edward Hallstrom owned a
single specimen in Australia in the 1950s but I am aware of none in
captivity at the present time, apart from my own bird. I should be
most interested to know of the existence of any others.
Strangely enough, this rare species was bred in Holland in 1913 by
F. E. Blaauw, a member of the Society. While in Chile in 1911 he saw
a tame Slender-bill in an inn near Puerto Varas (avicultural maga-
zine, May 1913, p. 198). Just before returning to Holland he was able
to buy another.
To quote from the parrots of south America : " For two years the
pair lived in a large garden aviary during the summer and spent the
winters in a birdroom, demolishing the woodwork of their flight. In
1913 they went to nest in a roomy log towards the end of May. After
about three weeks the cries of young birds, described as resembling the
sounds made by young Green Woodpeckers, were heard. On August 3 a
strong young one fledged, followed by another a day later. Two addled
eggs remained in the nest. In 1916 four more were reared.
" Extras provided while the young were being reared were bread
soaked in milk, pieces of Berberis dulcis , and grass roots. It is interesting
to note that although Blaauw never observed these birds feeding on
the ground in the wild they delighted in digging up the turf in the
aviary."
The birds mentioned in this article are the only examples I know of
which have been kept in captivity. If my bird is typical of its species,
they are utterly captivating--but have one fault, that shared by so
many neotropical parrots--an unpleasant voice. The Slender-bill's
calls are exceptionally harsh and penetrating, rather like a much
amplified sound made by a Jendaya Conure. I am immune to most
psittacine screams and screeches but the Slender-bill has the unfortu-
nate ability to penetrate the top of one's head! His most deafening
call is made while rapidly bobbing the head up and down.

By K. E. L. Simmons
(Dept, of Psychology, The University, Leicester)
Having been interested in problems of head-scratching in birds for
many years (Simmons 1957, 1961, 1963, 1964), I read with considerable
interest the article on scratching and preening postures of humming-
birds (Trochilidae) published in the last number of volume 79 of the
avicultural magazine (Mobbs 1973). In particular, I was intrigued
by the descriptions of " scratch-preening " and the implication that the
method of head-scratching in this quite obviously monophyletic family
was variable.
Scratch-Preening
In my 1961 paper on head-scratching, I distinguished between (1)
basic scratching, and (2) extended scratching. The former--so-called
" scratching reflex "--is used by all birds as " a simple, automatic
response to irritation or foreign bodies on the head parts . . . , and the
scratching is usually limited to the one spot on head or bill The
second type is, in some species at least, an important part of the
feather-care system, i.e. it supplements the more usual preening with
the bill and enables the bird to deal with its head-parts which, of
course, are otherwise inaccessible for self-preening. A particularly good
example of the use of the " extended " scratching is the head-oiling
behaviour of most passerine birds (see descriptions in Simmons 1961,
1963). Some groups, e.g. herons (Ardeidae) have a special preening
comb (pectinated claw) on the longest toe of each foot for the extended
treatment of the head-parts by scratching.
The distinction between basic and extended head-scratching has
been accepted by later writers (e.g. McKinney 1965). However, the
term " extended "--which refers to function--is apt to be confusing,
giving the general reader the impression of duration. While it is true
that " extended " scratches (in my sense) do tend to last longer than
basic scratches, this is by no means always the case; besides, that dis-
tinction was not intended. Mr. Mobbs' term " scratch-preening " is
much to be preferred and should be widely adopted. I also propose that
the term " plumage-scratching " should be used as a generic name for
all types of self-scratching to distinguish these from other forms of
foot-scratching behaviour-- i.e. as used in food-seeking nest-shaping,
and dusting. Two main types of plumage-scratching may be recognised:
(1) head-scratching, and (2) scratch-preening; and we may also talk
of a " head-scratch " and a " preening-scratch " for the individual
movements concerned. Thus, in the new and stricter sense, head-
scratching is the equivalent only of what I previously called " basic
scratching ", just as scratch-preening is the equivalent of " extended
scratching". Of course, in practice, it may sometimes be difficult to

differentiate between a true head-scratch and a preening-scratch of the
head, but I still believe the distinction to be a valid and useful one.
Most known examples of scratch-preening concern the head-parts
and involve the same sort of rapid movements as in true head-
scratching. In some parrots (Psittaciformes), however, I recorded
(Simmons 1961) a much slower, gentler "face-clawing" action in
which the toes are used like fingers; also " face-rubbing " in which the
head in the area of the bill is played against the clenched toes--though
this is not scratching in the obvious sense, i.e. by use of the claws.
Brockway (1962) has also recorded that the Budgerigar Melopsittacus
undulatus commonly " scratches " its rear-end in the area of the lateral
under tail-coverts with the foot; but, like the face-rubbing behaviour
just mentioned, this hardly seems true scratching as the bird uses only
the upper parts of the toes and the joint between them and the tarsus
to rub its plumage with a rapid back and forth movement. It would
seem, therefore, that true scratch-preening of parts of the body other
than the head has, so far, been described adequately only among
certain hummingbirds by Mobbs (1973), though it seems likely that
similar behaviour may well prevail in at least a few other groups con-
vergent either in their highly aerial habits or in possessing long bills
that make conventional preening difficult. One would also perhaps
expect to find scratch-preening of the body in some of the birds which
otherwise use the feet dexterously, e.g. as a hand for taking food to the
bill--as in certain rails (Rallidae) and parrots. In the hummingbirds,
the movements of scratch-preening are typically perfonned more
slowly than those of head-scratching, the birds giving " the impression
of actually combing the feathers with the claws" (Mobbs 1973).
Head-Scratching
As is well known, there are two methods used by birds when engag-
ing in true head-scratching : (1) the direct method, in which the foot is
brought straight up to the head " under " the wing; and (2) the indirect
method, in which the wing is lowered and the foot brought up " over "
the humerus. Despite assertions to the contrary {e.g. Nice and Schantz
!959, Berger 1961), it is now firmly established that in the vast majority
of cases each species of bird uses one head-scratching method only,
and that that method is shared by all members of the same natural
{i.e. monophyletic) family or subfamily. In odd cases, some species do
head-scratch in the opposite manner to that prevalent in the rest of
their family or subfamily, but here one mostly suspects that the tax-
onomy of such groups-- e.g. the Parulidae (American wood-warblers)--
may be at fault. There is, however, the rare puzzling case such as that
of the Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus which scratches directly,
whereas so far as is known all other Acrocephalus warblers and other
Sylviidae scratch indirectly.
There is no truth in the belief that individual birds are capricious in

which method of head-scratching they employ, now using the one,
now the other; on the contrary, the method is as fixed--as species-
characteristic---as any anatomical feature. In species that head-scratch
directly--of, for example, the families Gaviidae (divers), Podicipedidae
(grebes), Pelecanidae (pelicans), Sulidae (gannets and boobies), Phal-
acrocoracidae (cormorants), Ardeidae (herons), Ciconiidae (storks),
Threskiornithidae (ibises), Anatidae (waterfowl), Accipitridae (hawks),
Falconidae (falcons), Phasianidae (pheasants), Gruidae (cranes),
Rallidae (rails), Scolopacidae (waders), Laridae (gulls), Alcidae (auks),
Columbidae (pigeons), Guculidae (cuckoos), Strigidae (owls), Capi-
tonidae (barbets), and Ramphastidae (toucans)--no single case exists
of an individual ever, in any circumstances at all, using the indirect
method. For indirect scratching species-- e.g. in the Fregatidae (frigate-
birds), Haematopodidae (oystercatchers), Recurvirostridae (avocets and
stilts), Charadriidae (plovers), Pteroclididae (sandgrouse), Muso-
phagidae (touracos), Apodidae (swifts), Trochilidae (hummingbirds),
Coliidae (mousebirds), Trogonidae (trogons), Alcedinidae (kingfishers),
Meropidae (bee-eaters), Coraciidae (rollers), Bucerotidae (hornbills),
and the majority of passerine families--much the same situation exists,
but with some apparent exceptions. These latter fall almost entirely
within the following categories, (i) During ontogeny, the young of
certain species may initially head-scratch directly but later switch
exclusively to the adult, species-characteristic, indirect method; this
has been recorded, for example, in some waders (von Frisch 1959), in
lovebirds Agapornis (Dilger i960), and in some passerines (various
authors). (2) Some species which habitually head-scratch indirectly
when perched will do so directly in flight; these would seem mainly to
be highly aerial birds, such as frigatebirds (which spend much of their
lives soaring and carry out much of their feather-care in the air) and
hummingbirds (as recorded by Mobbs 1973)--but there is also a
record for the Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta (Makkink 1936), and I
myself have seen it once in the Rook Corvus frugilegus. (3) Indirect
scratching species subjected to abnormal irritation on the head in
stressful circumstances will sometimes react so quickly that their move-
ments become uncoordinated : they may droop the wing but take the
foot straight up to the head; this happened when Nice and Schantz
( 1 959 ) P ut bits of sticky paper on the heads of trapped birds (Simmons
1961).
In the hummingbirds, Mobbs (1973) claims that, while indirect
scratching is the rule, many long-billed species--- i.e. those most inclined
to scratch-preen--are as likely to scratch one way as the other. Here,
one suspects, no clear distinction was made between the types of
plumage-scratching, and I would guess that if one carefully collected
records of both type and method of scratching in this group, it would
be found that all true head-scratches were indirect while the preening-

scratches might be either direct or indirect. Certainly, neither in this
group or any other, would one expect plumage-scratching to be
invariably carried out by the indirect method--even on the head. The
parallel may be found in some parrots which head-scratch indirectly
but (1) face-rub directly, e.g. Sierra Parrakeet Amoropsittaca aymara,
or (2) take food up to the bill directly, e.g. Bauer's Parrakeet Barnardius
zonarius (Simmons 1961).

Compiled by Peter Brown
The results of this, the first attempt to publish a list of birds, other
than common or domesticated species, bred in this country during the
past year are given below, together with the names and addresses of
those who kindly responded to my request.
In future it is hoped to publish the list much earlier; also it is hoped
that more members will provide the necessary information and in good
time.

Writing in the avicultural bulletin the journal of the Avicultural
Society of America, Mr. Rae V. Anderson tells of receiving in 1969 a
pair of the Great Black or Palm Cockatoo Probosciger aterrimus
imported from Singapore and believed to be the race intermedins from
the Aru Islands. The birds were apparently quite young and had had
the vane stripped from all the primary feathers so as to prevent flight.
They were kept indoors until the following summer and then put into
an outdoor aviary at Mr. Anderson's home in California. The male
moulted and his plumage became perfect, but the female did not moult
at all, so that by the winter of 1970 her feathers had deteriorated even
further, the few that did fall being replaced by others that never
properly formed and dropped out before being fully grown. This con-
dition continued for the next two years and in addition to the poor
state of the plumage, the bird suffered periodic seizures. Although offered
a varied diet of nuts, seeds, pelleted foods, fruit, carrot, green peas and
other green food, bread and cheese, this bird ate nothing but sunflower
seeds and cheese, a few almonds being sometimes eaten. Peanuts would
be eaten if other foods were withheld. A vitamin compound was given
daily in the water. Tests were made to see if the feather condition was
due to fungal invasion of the follicles, but with negative results. In
December 1972 Ocean salt (the residue from solar evaporated sea
water) was added daily to the drinking water at the rate of i# grms
to a litre of water (about J teaspoon to 1 quart) and this was, of course,
the only water available to the bird. Within four months she began to

grow new feathers, the seizures stopped and by August 1973 the
plumage appeared to be normal and, of course, she could fly; also the
cheek colour had changed from an anaemic pallor to the normal pink.
Mr. Anderson says that Ocean salt is obtainable from "health" food
stores in the United States and that ordinary sea water could be used,
provided, of course, that it is unpolluted. The title of Mr. Anderson's
paper is "Trace mineral deficiency as one cause of improper feather
growth".

Mr. P. H. Hastings writes to say that a Black-headed Sugar Bird
imported by him in 1959 has, during the past four years, laid at least
40 eggs, laying two each time and at intervals of 6-8 weeks. The bird
was almost dead on arrival and was nursed back to health by Mrs.
Hastings. It must be some sixteen years of age, for it was adult on
arrival and the two most recently laid eggs which Mr. Hastings has sent
are perfectly formed and marked.

Among the diurnal birds of prey bred in captivity during 1973 are
the following records kindly sent by Mr. R. E. Kenward : Goshawk
Ac cipher gentilis : seven young at least have been bred in West Ger-
many. Lanner Falco biarmicus : a pair in West Germany raised five
and in the U.S.A. two pairs reared seven chicks. The Prairie Falcon
Falco mexicanus was bred for the first time in Europe, four young
being reared in West Germany, while at Cornell, U.S.A. two pairs
bred. A first recorded captive breeding of the Saker Falcon Falco
cherrug took place in Hamburg, one chick being raised, while three
pairs of Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus at Cornell reared between
them twenty young and a pair in Alberta, Canada, reared three.

dens, Rode, on 18th June: European White Storks. Two pairs have
nested and one pair now have three chicks, about a week old. Sacred
Ibis have two nests of chicks and Scarlet Ibis have three nests, two with
chicks. Spoonbills have started to build nests and Little Egrets have
two nests with eggs. Sarus Cranes laid their first clutch too near the
public pathway so the eggs were taken and both hatched under a
cross-bred bantam : one chick died almost immediately, but the other
is now three weeks old and is already taller than its foster parent. The
breeding pair laid again and have just hatched two more chicks.
Demoiselle Cranes. One pair are incubating two eggs.
Six pairs of macaws are breeding, including two pairs of second
generation Blue and Yellow. Of the six pairs, one is a pair of Green-
winged which were bred by John Rigge of Cumberland about eight
years ago, so these are really second generation home-bred. There are
two pairs of Red and Yellow, one with eggs and one with chicks, and
three pairs of Blue and Yellow, two with chicks and one with eggs. Of
these one is our old original breeding pair who now have three chicks.
Up to last year they had produced twenty young over a period of eight
years.
A pair of Severe Macaws and Umbrella Cockatoos are sitting on
eggs, while Leadbeater's have reared one chick.
Two pairs of Derbyan Parrakeets are sitting; a pair of Plumheads
hatched a brood but failed to rear them. Greater Patagonian Conures
are sitting and we have the usual crop of Ringnecks, Rosellas, Mealy
Rosellas and Cockatiels, all with eggs or young.
We have eggs from Eiders, North American Ruddy Duck and the
usual crop of Maned Geese, Mandarin, Carolina, Pochard, Barnacle,
Lesser White-fronted and Bar-headed Geese are being reared.
The Malayan Argus laid one egg which was unfertile and the adult
birds are now moulting. Peacock pheasants--four chicks only reared.
This is our worst result with these birds for some years. Swinhoe's,
Blue Crossoptilon, Monal, Golden, Amherst's and Reeves' Pheasants
have all laid or are being reared.
Rothschild's Grackles have hatched but failed to rear and are now
sitting on another clutch. Purple Glossy Starlings and Andaman
Mynahs are sitting on eggs.

Dr. L. A. Swaenepoel writes : The many friends of M. Guy Detry
will learn with sorrow of his death on 4th May after a short illness.
M. Detry, a member of the Society since 1958, kept a number of rare
insectivorous birds and specialised in humming birds. He achieved
some notable successes in breeding difficult and delicate species. Mme.
Detry will continue to keep the collection at Wavre, and to her we
extend our deepest sympathy in her bereavement.

Cerebral Haemorrhage in Birds
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993024578947369" page_id="56470921"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
In common with other aviculturists I have had the experience of having
apparently fit birds suddenly drop dead. When I have examined such birds the
only cause of death that I could find was evidence of haemorrhage within the
cranium, apparent as a dark patch on the almost transparent layer of thin bone
over the brain. W r hile this seemed to be the immediate cause of death it seemed
possible that it was brought about by some other factor. Stress due to captive
conditions was a possible cause, but since some of the birds were captive bred
and had been under aviary conditions for many years this did not seem to be
the whole answer. On the evidence then available I had assumed that it was due
to conditions of constraint, and I was therefore interested to read in Bird Life,
the magazine of the R.S.P.B. Young Ornithologists' Club, two records of appar-
ently healthy birds being seen to drop dead during flight. The birds were a
Common Buzzard and a Robin. The former was examined by the Nature Con-
servancy and brain haemorrhage was suggested as the cause of death. It may
be that this is a natural form of death in birds, occurring more frequently than
we imagine, but more likely to be noticed under captive conditions than in the
wild.

THE GENERIC NAME Rhodonessa
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976415555555555" page_id="56470921"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
There is a small error in Mr. Prestwich's paper on the Pink-headed Duck.
This is in the footnote on p.47 giving the derivation of the scientific name. The
generic name Rhodonessa is based on the Greek rhodon, a rose, as stated, but
the second half of the word is not derived from esson, less or weaker. The Greek
word for duck is spelled either netta or nessa and appears as the root in many
generic names of waterfowl --Heteronetta Amazonetta, Dendronessa, etc. Under
the entry for " duck " in R. W. Brown's Composition of Scientific Words
(privately published in 1956, but later distributed by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion) Rhodonessa is specifically cited as an example of the use of this root.

Frith on "Birds of Paradise in Captivity; a Major Moral Problem" published
in your March/April issue?
I share the concern expressed by Mr. Frith that avicultural activities might
be the reason why some species of birds are becoming very scarce and might
even cause their extinction; however, I am of the opinion that avicultural
activities have never been the cause whereby any species of birds has become
extinct and that aviculture has not yet prevented the extinction of a species.
Extra avicultural interest is always directed at a species as soon as it becomes

in short supply, the shortage in supply is always associated with causes such as
the destruction of natural habitat, the introduction of predatory animals and
changes in climatic conditions and supplies of food.
The suggestion put forward for the control of trade and illegal trafficking
cannot have any effect; no Society in this country can possibly influence a
foreign power with regard to the use it makes of its own fauna. I would also
suggest that other Societies would object to the suggestion that the Avicultural
Society should decide who should be privileged to care for rare birds.
Many hundreds of pounds have been spent on the provision of " Perfect
Conditions 55 for humming birds and for their care by " Experts ", yet a simple
garden setup and the dedication of Mrs. Scamell brought success with their
breeding. It is an accepted fact that the devoted small bird keeper gets better
breeding results than the large establishments using paid help.
When Mr. Frith suggests that we should not wait for directives from conser-
vational bodies and legislation, he is obviously not aware of the fact that the
waiting period is ended. The required legislation is being introduced by means
of the " Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora our Government has already signed the convention
and it now awaits our ratification. At least thirty-seven other countries have also
signed it.
The Convention issued two Appendices of endangered species of fauna and
flora, the Paradisaeidae appears in Appendix II and the following regulations
will eventually govern trade in these species.

determines that the export of specimens of any such species should be
limited in order to maintain that species throughout its range at a level
at which that species might become eligible for inclusion in Appendix I.

The conditions attached to the movement of species listed in Appendix I are
greater, for in addition to an export permit, an import permit is also required
and the conditions attached to the granting of an import permit include satis-
faction that the species will be suitably housed and cared for and that they will
not primarily be used for commercial purposes. It is possible that this condition
could prevent them being used as part of a bird garden where an entrance
charge is made.
Incidentally the Kakapo and the Puerto Rican Amazon, mentioned in "News
and Views" of that same issue are listed in Appendix I of the Convention.
Parrots and pheasants are the two largest groups of birds listed in these two
appendices: the only criticism I can make on these appendices is the fact that
the Splendid Grass Parrakeet Neophema splendida appears in Appendix I; there
is, however, an exemption clause that allows birds bred in captivity and listed
in Appendix I to be downgraded to Appendix II. Since there are perhaps more

Splendids in captivity outside Australia than there are wild Splendids in the
whole of Australia and since Australia bans the export of fauna, it seems a
waste of time to list it anywhere. I am sure that Splendids are more easily and
cheaply available from aviculturists than from a wild bird trapper/cum smug-
gler.
I hope that this information will put Mr. Frith's mind at rest and that the
conditions laid down will meet with his approval and indeed with the approval
of all right-minded aviculturists. I realise that the word legislation is looked
upon as a dirty word by some bird keepers, but how else can international
agreement on endangered species be arrived at?

Some Instances of Partial Albinism in Wild Birds
While looking through some copies of the East Africa Natural History
Society Bulletin, I found four recently recorded instances of partial albinism
in wild birds that concern species often kept by aviculturists.
The October 1971 issue contains an account of a RuppelFs Long-tailed
Glossy Starling Lamprotornis caudatus with a white head and tail which visited

the cattle yards and fruit garden of a farm near Nanyuki, Kenya. A letter from
a correspondent at Arusha, Tanzania, published in the April 1972 issue con-
cerns a Superb Starling Spreo superbus with almost all the areas of the plumage
that are normally blue, white instead, the characteristic white band across the
chest being indiscernible.
In the February 1972 issue there is a record of a Laughing Dove Streptopelia
senegalensis with the whole of the head, underside and upper mantle pure white,
but otherwise normally coloured. The same issue contains a letter about a Dark-
capped Bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus with the wing-coverts and top of the mantle
white and with white streaks in the wings and tail. Both were seen at different

(Deputy Curator, Wildfowl Trust, Slknbridge, Gloucester)
An expedition to South America was undertaken by the Wildfowl
Trust's Curator, Michael Lubbock, in November, 1973, in order to
collect adults, juveniles and eggs of native waterfowl.
Among eggs sent back were those of the Black-headed Duck
Heteronetta atricapilla. The species is interesting because it is an
obligate brood parasite, laying only in the nests of other birds, and has
not until now been raised successfully in captivity (Weller 1968). The
eggs were large (six measured on average 58.5 mm x 43.8 mm) and
with a finely pitted texture. They were collected at various stages of
incubation from the nests of many different species* and, prior to
being sent by air to England, were kept in portable incubators. They
were later packed, while still warm, in polystyrene boxes full of duck-
down. After a flight of 17 hours and custom procedures at both
Buenos Aires and Heathrow Airport, the eggs had been out of an
incubator for a period exceeding 30 hours. Nevertheless, from 20
fertile eggs, 12 ducklings hatched and 9 were raised to maturity.

bating and hatching the Heteronetta eggs. The incubation period
could not be determined exactly, but the longest time between the
arrival of the eggs and emergence of a duckling was 30 days. Hatching
was observed on each occasion. Thirty-six hours before the duckling
hatched, it became extremely vocal and, at this stage, the egg was
transferred to an incubator with a humidity in excess of 90%. From
the time of the first chip in the shell, hatching was extremely fast, the
whole process taking no more than two hours. This was the only
behavioural feature that obviously linked the species to the tribe
Oxyurini, to which it probably belongs (Johnsgard 1965).

The newly hatched ducklings were removed from the high humidity
and placed in a drying incubator for six hours. They were then placed
on cotton terry-towelling in a small cubicle measuring 45 cm x 30 cm.
A 250 watt infra-red heat lamp was hung 60 cm above the towel and
underfloor heating was also provided. Into the cubicle were placed
two circular dishes., measuring 14 cm in diameter, both containing
a few pebbles. Water was added to one dish and a commercial food
" Pro Nutro " (protein level 22%) mixed with water to the other. Once
hatched, the ducklings were noticeably quiet. Feeding was first seen
when they were twelve hours old and thereafter they fed frequently.
Every hour a little cold water was added to the food to prevent
drying out, and the food was completely changed every six hours
so that it did not sour. When the ducklings were not aware of a
human observer, they were very active, but if approached closely
immediately froze and remained motionless with head lowered in
an apparently threatening posture. During the first two days, there-
fore, the ducklings were not handled, and no attempt was made to
pinion or to sex them. Then the towel was changed, the cubicle size
increased to 45 cm x 40 cm and a small amount of ground dried
shrimp was added to the " Pro Nutro The size of the cubicle was
increased every twenty-four hours until the ducklings were enclosed
in an area of 45 cm x 80 cm. On the sixth day the heat lamp was
raised to 80 cm, and the towel exchanged for a fitted section of indoor/
outdoor carpeting. The food and water pans were placed on a wire
grid, through which spillage passed, thus allowing a continual flow
of water to be supplied by an overhead dripfeed system into the
water pan.
At this stage, with the ducklings feeding well, a mixture of finely
ground grain, dog biscuit, maize, dried shrimp and turkey starter
crumbs was introduced in small quantities to the existing semi-liquid
diet. The ducklings were now spending much time in their water tray
and were observed preening between regular intervals of feeding and
sleeping.
On the eighth day, the ducklings were transferred to a large water
tank built for rearing North American Ruddy Ducks Oxyura
jamaicensis jamaicensis, to a design suggested by Miss J. Cecil-Wright
in 1972. This measures 66 x 45 x 95 cm. Attached to the tank by a
ramp leading into the water was a shelf 66 x 30 cm with back and
side walls 25 cm high. A strip of plastic coated weld-mesh wire was
fixed to the ramp to help the ducklings enter and leave the water.
A heat bulb was hung 80 cm above a strip of indoor/outdoor car-
peting placed upon this shelf, and a food dish was available near the
edge of the water. No more than three ducklings were kept together.
At first the ducklings did not venture onto the water and tended to

drink with sweeping movements of the bill while sitting on the shelf.
Duckweed Lemna was floated on the surface and this soon tempted
the birds to swim. Although the water was accessible at all times,
there was a tendency for the birds to remain on the ramp (see also
Weller 1968). However, when two Heteronetta were raised with an
Argentine Ruddy Duck Oxyura jamaicensis vittata, the Ruddy Duck
spent most of its time on the water, only occasionally mounting the
ramp, and the Black-headed Ducks did likewise. They never dived
at any stage, although the Ruddy Duck did so frequently. After
three days in the tank, seeds consisting of white millet, canary seed
and red rape were added to the diet. These were floated on the
surface and the ducklings would immediately enter the water and
dabble eagerly.
On the seventeenth day, the first feathers were visible on the
breast and from this time the ducklings developed rapidly. On the
twenty-fourth day, the heat lamp was turned off during the day.
By the thirty-third day, the ducklings were well feathered on the
breast, flanks, and the top of the back, and the tail was well formed.
The head was still downy, as was the rump. The vertical dark stripe
from the eye to the forehead (very noticeable in the young duckling)
became barely visible. The heat lamp was switched off completely
on the thirty-fifth day.
By the fifty-fifth day the flight feathers were fully grown and the
entire body, except for the rump, was feathered. The juvenile plumage
of both sexes is rather like that of female stiff tails (the horizontal
dark barring of the flanks and sides being especially obvious), but
when adult, the birds show little similarity to this group.
On the forty-fifth day, the ducklings were taken from their tank
to a larger outdoor pond. A little wheat was added to the existing
seed diet and the milled mixture gradually phased out. Ample duck-
weed was always available floating on the water.
One duckling was reared alone, but unfortunately died at fifty-three
days of Aspergillosis; there was one group of three, and three groups
of two. It was clear that the young ducklings were not gregarious and
did not huddle together as other broods do. At about thirty-five days
they were, however, sitting together and appearing to seek each other's
company.
Conclusions
Hand-raising Heteronetta atricapilla is relatively simple provided
that they are kept undisturbed, a variety of suitable foods is offered,
and heat and water supplies are adequate.

THE BEHAVIOUR AND NESTING OF THE
TURQUOISE TANAGER
Tangara mexicana
By Johan Ingels (Destelbergen, Belgium)
Introduction
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9790005" page_id="56470935"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
These notes describe an unsuccessful breeding attempt made by a
pair of Turquoise Tanagers Tangara mexicana during 1973.
Other vernacular names are : the Mexican Tanager (Snow 1962)
(although it does not occur in Mexico), the Yellow-bellied Tanager
(Norgaard-Olesen 1973) and the Blue-and-yellow Tanager (Herklots
1961).
Description
The subspecies involved was Tangara mexicana boliviana, which is
found throughout N. Brazil (Amazonas), S.E. Colombia (Meta and
Vichada), E. Ecuador, E. Peru and N.E. Bolivia (La Paz, Cochabamba
and Santa Cruz). It is imported from Ecuador, and occasionally from
Colombia.
It differs mainly from the other subspecies in that it is smaller
(measuring only 5.2 in.) and has blue instead of distinct turquoise
wing-coverts. The centre of the belly and under tail-coverts are golden
rather than pale yellow; however, these parts may fade to yellowish
white after a moult in captivity. The throat and the sides of the body
lack the scaled appearance which is apparent in other subspecies.

Two Turquoise Tanagers were purchased at the beginning of 1972.
Once established, they were introduced into a mixed collection of
approximately forty tanagers which were housed in a well planted and
heated aviary. During the summer months, they were given access to
a densely planted outside flight (Ingels 1971). They spent the 1972-73
winter in the inside aviary, which was kept at about 6o* F.
At the end of March 1973, the Turquoise Tanagers were moved to
a large unheated greenhouse, approximately 80 ft. long X 20 ft. wide
X 10 ft. centre height. Also housed in the greenhouse were about
twenty-five other tanagers ( Tangara , Thraupis , Ramphocelus and
Piranga species). The greenhouse was planted with Aralia plants, a
number of small bushes of maple ( Acer species) and elder Sambucus
nigra , all of which were overgrown with weeds of about 3 ft. high.
At the end of March/beginning of April, the outside temperature
dropped during the night to below 32 0 F. These low temperatures
apparently did not harm the tanagers; even the smaller ones such as
Silver-throated Tangara icterocephala, Golden Tangara arthus,
Golden-masked Tangara larvata and the Turquoise.
The whole collection was fed on fresh fruits (apple, pear, orange,
some banana and soaked currants), deep-frozen berries (elder and

mountain ash), universal (insectile) food, softfood (a mixture of bread,
universal food, chick crumbs, honey, sliced figs and dates, boiled meat
and egg, vitamins and mineral salts), sponge-cake, live food (ant pupae,
mealworms) and a mixture of water, honey and water-soluble proteins.
Behaviour
During their first season the Turquoise Tanagers did not show any
real interest in each other, although they were occasionally seen
together, mainly on the feeding shelf. At the end of the 1972-73 winter,
the reciprocal interest grew, and I began to hope they may be a true
pair. However, they were never seen to feed each other, which is a
common habit in Tangara species.
When at the beginning of 1973, two more Turquoise Tanagers were
purchased, the resident pair harassed these newly introduced birds,
chasing them around the aviary until they become exhausted. Because
of this the newly acquired birds were removed. Turquoise Tanagers are
described as being highly social, living in small closely knit groups; a
pair only leaving the group temporarily while breeding (Snow 1962). It
is possible therefore that the original pair were already in breeding
condition when the newly acquired Turquoise Tanagers were intro-
duced, hence the aggression.
Although there was no obvious colour difference, one of the estab-
lished Turquoise Tanagers was slightly larger, more active and bolder
than its mate and therefore I assumed it to be a male; this assumption
was proved correct when the pair went to nest. Junge and Mees (1961)
drew the same conclusion when measuring skins collected in Trinidad,
Surinam and Guyana.
The behaviour of the pair changed completely after moving them to
the unheated greenhouse. Both birds kept together, and were often
seen to fly from the feeding shelf towards the rear part of the green-
house in one stretch (about 60 ft.), uttering their faint chirping calls
during the whole flight. When perched or flying over short distances
they were always silent. This observation agrees with that of Belcher
and Smooker (1937) who wrote, "a faint chirp was heard only when
these tanagers were moving from one tree to another in small parties
of seven or eight birds."
The pair always slept a short distance from each other, on a high
perch where the glass of the greenhouse was covered on the outside
with rush-matting. This matting was spread over part of the green-
house to provide shade during sunny weather thus helping to keep the
inside temperature below 85* F.
Nesting
Many different types of half-open and open nestboxes were placed
around the greenhouse. Other nesting sites such as hollow tree-stumps,
funnels made of rush-matting, etc., were also available. Dried grasses,
weed stems, etc., littered the floor, thus giving birds in breeding condi-

tion ample choice of nesting material.
It was on the 1st May, 1973, that the female was first seen carrying
nesting material. The pair had not yet made up their mind as to
where they would build, and were continually looking around the
greenhouse for an acceptable site. The birds were rather shy, and
observation of their activities was somewhat difficult, but as far as I
am aware, the female only built the nest. This agrees with the obser-
vations made by Snow (1962) who wrote, " only one bird actually built,
attended closely by another, the presumed male."
On the 7th and 8th May, the female seemed to be somewhat out of
condition, being weak on the wing and sitting fluffed when perched;
the reason for this was not obvious.
When I entered the greenhouse on the morning of the 9th May, the
female was seen to fly from a bunch of dried Platycerium ferns which
were growing in a basket hanging from the roof of the greenhouse near
the feeding shelf. On inspection, I found a nest containing two eggs,
situated beneath an overhanging dry leaf of the fern. The eggs were
basically greyish-white, with overlying brown blotches and spots, and
some underlying grey clouding; agreeing with the description made
by Belcher and Smooker (1937) and Haverschmidt (1968). The cup-
shaped nest was made up of rootlets, coarse weed stems and grass
blades, dried leaves, some seed fluff and a few reed leaves, lined with
fine grasses. The birds seemed to prefer pale coloured nesting material,
such as whitish coloured seed fluff. As to the position of the nest, it
was the highest and most well-concealed " natural " site available in
the greenhouse. This agrees with observations made in the wild by
Haverschmidt (1968). It is possible the female was out of condition on
the 7th and 8th May due to egg laying on consecutive days.
The female was rather shy, and would leave the nest whenever I
entered the greenhouse, to return only when I had left the building. I
noticed that when the female left the nest, either through my entering
the greenhouse, or because she wished to feed, the male always accom-
panied her.
On the 17th May, I learned from close inspection of the eggs with
a mirror, that only one was fertilized. This egg hatched sometime dur-
ing the afternoon of May the 21st. This means that if the eggs were
laid between the 7th and 9th May, the incubation period would be
twelve to fourteen days.
On the 22 nd May, both tanagers had become very active and could
be seen hunting for live food near the glass and along the top of the
side walls of the greenhouse. When sufficient live food was gathered,
both birds flew to the nest, the female going immediately to the
youngster, while the male waited nearby. Whether the male fed the
youngster, I was unable to determine although I had the impression
he did so occasionally. After two days, the female was seen to bring

mealworm pupae to the nest, but she showed no interest in the deep-
frozen ant pupae, of which she was normally very fond.
The youngster disappeared on the 25th May and was found dead
two days later under a perch near the entrance door, above which a
pair of Blue-grey Tanagers Thraupis episcopus were nesting in a box.
Whether the youngster died naturally or was killed by the pair of Blue-
greys, I was unable to determine. As this pair of tanagers were nesting
at that time, and as they showed interest in the dry ferns and weeds
in the basket, it is possible they discovered the Turquoise Tanager's
nest and removed the youngster, regarding it as a possible food item.
The Turquoise Tanagers commenced building a second nest at the
end of May. It was built in a funnel of rush-matting, situated on a
rafter near the glass roof, about 7 ft. from the ground. The nest was
only accessible to the smaller tanagers, and so well concealed that I
was unable to look into it. This second nest was never completed.
An aspect of the breeding habits of the Turquoise Tanagers which I
was unable to verify, was the social behaviour described by Snow
(1962). He observed that adult birds other than the parents but belong-
ing to the same social group, were often seen to help feed the young.
As I did not succeed in forming a social group of these birds, mainly
because the original pair were already in breeding condition, I was
unable to make any observations with regard to this particular
behaviour.

Padda oryzivora
By T. j. Seller (Imperial College of Science and Technology, London)
Species of the family Estrildidae have always aroused much interest,
both among aviculturists and scientists and many papers on them have
appeared in the pages of this Magazine. At least one, familiar to avi-
culturists, has been the subject of little scientific attention and this
is the Java Sparrow. English contributions on this species seem to be
confined to two short notes by Page (1897), a paper by Goodwin (1963)
and mentions in papers by Morris (1956, 1958). Additionally, there are
papers by various German authors cited in Goodwin (1963). This
dearth of literature is surprising since Java Sparrows are easy to main-
tain and, in my experience, breed well in captivity.
The paper by Goodwin contains a detailed description of Java
Sparrow courtship. These findings are generally confirmed, and are
extended in the present paper. The new description is also required
for the analyses of sequences, given below.
Five pairs of wild, grey Java Sparrow were kept in an indoor aviary
measuring approximately 6 X 6 X 4.5 ft. Lighting was provided by three
six foot, 85 watt, daylight fluorescent tubes, that were controlled by a
time switch. The birds' " day " lasted from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. throughout
the year. In addition to the various perches, each pair had a wooden
nest box, 6x6x9 in., screwed to the back or a side wall of the aviary,
70 in. above the floor, and at least 16 in. apart. Cleaning was made
easier by polypropylene sheeting on the floor, that was covered by
polyroll. The food provided was a mixture of two parts panicum millet
to one part foreign finch mix, and millet sprays. Mealworms were given
from time to time, and were always eaten rapidly. Green food was not
taken. The drinking water contained a vitamin supplement.
A Complete &amp;quot; Courtship Sequence
The male always initiated courtship, by approaching the female in
a posture with the neck, back and tail in a horizontal line. The beak
pointed down and the feathers fluffed. The male then began the
bouncing courtship display. This was achieved by extension of the
legs, rather than by an alteration in body posture. The movement was
similar to the " inverted curtsey " described in other estrildines ( e.g .
Morris, 1957; Baptista, 1973), but with a different body posture.
Frequently, the male jumped, rather than curtseyed, and the feet made
quite a noise on landing. The frequency and vigour of the bouncing
varied markedly, although they tended to increase. The male rarely
bounced on one part of the perch, but moved towards or away from
the female. The male performed stereotyped bill wiping between
bounces. In this, the perch was struck between the two birds, by a

sideways movement of the head. The duration of this bouncing display
varied between about ten seconds and two minutes. Generally, it
seemed that the display was of shorter duration when well established
pairs were involved. The reaction of the female seemed to have little
effect on duration.
Males were not silent during display. They emitted beak clicking
sounds during the early part of the display period; later this was
succeeded by song. Within the species, song is very variable, but indi-
viduals have only one song type. The song consists of a phrase that, in
non-courtship situations was usually heard twice. The song phrase was
repeated many times during courtship singing.
The female's first reaction to the bouncing display was to adopt a
similar posture to that of the male. The main differences were that the
female held her beak nearly horizontal, and she turned towards the
male. Some while after the male began courtship, the female would
bounce in reply; only rarely did she jump like the male. She also per-
formed bill wiping, and followed the male along the perch. Eventually
she solicited, in a manner similar to other estrildines, by crouching and
leaning forward, her head level with the perch and tail quivering. The
male then bounced up to the female, emitting song phrases. As he
approached, the male adopted a nearly vertical stretched posture, with
sleeked feathers. The female continued tail quivering after mounting,
but by then her body was horizontal. Balancing problems seemed to
delay the brief copulation. Mating was nearly always followed by
vigorous bill fencing, even in well established pairs. Frequently, each
individual stabbed five or more times at the other, before either the
female flew off, or the aggression changed to mutual mandibulation
and then mutual bowing display.
This courtship sequence was repeated several times before egg-laying
began.

Although the preceding section describes courtship in its most com-
plex form, it is neither typical, nor even frequently observed. Indeed,
it was recorded in only 7 out of 114 ( 6 %) of the sexual encounters
analysed. Within the aviary, courting birds were likely to be interrupted
by other adults or juveniles. Some 19% (27 out of 141) of all sexual
encounters were ended by an interruption. These are excluded from
the analysis, as they are not completed behavioural sequences.
There was a marked difference in the likely outcome of sexual
encounters between paired and non-paired birds (i.e. individuals paired
with other members of the colony), Table. Copulations between non-
paired birds were rare : 4% of sexual encounters between non-paired
birds resulted in copulation. The likelihood of interruption during
courtship was the same for all courting pairs. Therefore the small
chance of copulation between non-paired as compared with mated

birds, could not be attributed to males protecting their mates. The
most frequent cause of failure to mate in the non-paired birds was that
the female ignored the male (64% of observed encounters, see Table).
The other main reasons were that the sexual behaviour faded away for
no apparent reason (15%), and that the male dismounted without
copulation (15%). Non-paired birds were less likely to copulate after
mounting (22% of observed mounts) than paired birds (58%). Pos-
sibly, in the former group, the female was liable to be less co-operative.

The outcome of sexual encounters between paired and non-paired birds, after
the male had begun the bouncing courtship display.
Encounters between mated birds contrasted with those of non-paired
birds, especially in the behaviour of the female. The male was unlikely
to be ignored (only 6% of recorded cases). It was three times more
likely that the female would bounce in reply to the male (paired birds
60&apos;%, non-paired 19%) and that the female would solicit (paired
67%, non-paired 21%). Also the male mounted the female three times
as often (paired 68%, non-paired 19%). The chances of copulations
were ten times greater in paired (40%) than non-paired (4%) birds.
Points of similarity between the two groups of encounters were less
numerous. The behaviour observed was, of course, similar in both
groups, it was the likely outcome that differed. Aggressiveness after
mounting was equally probable, being 78% in each group. This indi-
cated that courting Java Sparrows had the strongly conflicting ten-
dencies of behaving aggressively as well as sexually towards their
partner.
Nest Building
The nest material provided was taken from baled hay, thus the
sizes of the pieces were very varied. Of these, the longest and thickest
were always preferred. The stalks of the millet sprays were also taken.
The material was carried in the usual estrildine manner, by one end,
in the tip of the beak. The nests built were examined on only two
occasions. Neither was well constructed nor showed any sign of weav-
ing; however, this may have been due to the unsuitability of the
nesting material provided. The lengths of hay were cut into short pieces
of about 2-3 in., and arranged to form a cup-like nest. The nest was
lined with feathers and small pieces of polyroll. One of the nests looked
at had been used for only a few weeks; the other was inhabited for

about 18 months. It appeared that the latter nest had been built up
throughout that time, as the construction was very thick, compared
with the other, but the nest cups were of similar size.

Subsequent Behaviour

<bodyText confidence="0.999504731707317" page_id="56470942"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
The females laid clutches of up to five eggs. Both members of a pair
incubated the eggs, although in general, the female sat for longer
periods than the male. There may be a nest relief ceremony, since
only during incubation were sounds heard from the pair when in the
nest box. These vocalisations involved a prolonged rolling call from
the female and many repetitions of the male's song phrase. The chicks
stayed in the nest for at least three weeks before fledging. These find-
ings agree with Soderberg (1956), who also reported that eggs took
about two weeks to hatch.
On emerging from the nest, juveniles had grey plumage with black
legs and beak. Initial periods out of the nest were rather short, ten to
fifteen minutes; these rapidly increased during the succeeding few
days. The juveniles began visiting the food bowls, and apparently
feeding, within three days of fledging, additionally they were
fed by both parents for several weeks. Members of the colony,
except for the parents, treated juveniles in a similar way to newly
introduced (" foreign ") adults. They were attacked and vigorously
pecked whenever an adult was approached and could lose a lot of
feathers. Attacks were mainly directed at the crown and nape rather
than at the feet, as is frequent in attacks on adult birds. In contrast,
to " foreign " adults, juveniles took little or no evasive action, and
rarely emitted even a squawk. Only occasionally did parents stay close
to their offspring, usually within a foot. This behaviour may have
protected juveniles from attack, and was the only such behaviour
observed. However, aviary individuals could not be more than three
yards apart. The vigour of the attacks on newly fledged juveniles and
the lack of effective protective behaviour made it surprising that
serious damage to a juvenile was observed only once. In this latter case,
the newly fledged bird was weak and could not fly properly. It was
subjected to attack by older juveniles as well as adults, and died within
36 hours. Juveniles became accepted, or at least ignored, by the
adults within two to three days. There was a similar period before the
acceptance of " foreign " adults.
The change to adult plumage is usually completed within four
months of fledging. In the present study the period to completion
varied from 8 to 14 weeks (average 9.6 weeks). However, one juvenile
was, at the time of writing, 16 weeks old and showed no sign of begin-
ning the moult. By the time the birds were in their adult plumage, the
bouncing behaviour, but not soliciting or mounting, had usually been
observed a number of times. The age at which sexual maturity is
reached does not seem to be recorded, but a pair raised in the aviary

bred in their eleventh month after hatching.
Breeding Record
During the period from January 1972 (when the colony&apos;was estab-
lished) until October 1973, 33 chicks were successfully fledged from
13 broods, raised at all times of the year. In addition, two newly
hatched chicks were found dead on the floor, and four found dead with
the hen, in a nest box. The mate of the latter bird had previously died
after being trapped against the aviary wall.
The minimum theoretical time between broods in the same pair is
about seven weeks, because the period from laying to fledging is 5-6
weeks (Soderberg 1956). The minimum recorded time between suc-
cessive broods was 11 weeks, the range extended up to 27 weeks
with an average of 19.67 weeks.

An attempt at breeding Peters' Twinspot began in mid-1972 when
a pair (pair 1) first nested. This pair was purchased in December
1971 and housed in a cage in a heated birdroom, the cage being
approximately 4x3x1! feet with access to an outdoor flight
measuring 6x6x6 feet. The flight faced south, the roof and east
side being partly covered. It was planted with two small Elder bushes
and a Cotoneaster, ground cover being provided by tussocks of grass
and a profusion of seeding grasses. Clumps of evergreen were fixed
high in each corner. Feeding was simple, only panicum millet being
added to the foods on the tray, since the other occupants of the
flight, Red-flanked Zosterops Z. erythropleura were supplied with
nectar food, sponge cake soaked in this food, soft pear, insectile food
and maggots. The twinspots were seen to eat all these foods and
when the zosterops were removed only the sponge cake soaked in nectar
was discontinued.

found on the floor of the indoor cage and a search of the outdoor
flight revealed a nest containing one egg, so from then on until the
winter the birds were no longer shut in at night. The nest was on
the ground in a corner of the flight under the sheltered part; it was
globular and measured approximately five inches across and a short
entrance tunnel was about one inch in diameter. Nothing came of
this nest; incubation commenced on July 8th and as the birds
were left undisturbed, the number and fate of the eggs is not known.
No further nesting activity was observed until, on September 4th,
a dead chick about a day old, was found on the floor of the indoor
cage and next day another dead one was found in the same place.
Following this the pair began nesting in a globular wicker basket in
the indoor compartment, but were discouraged by me because of
the lateness of the season. When tidying the outside flight at the end
of the summer, five completed nests and one partly built were found
and in every case they were built on the ground well hidden in the
grass. All were like the one already described, built of dried grass and
lined with finer grasses, dog hair and feathers, but only the first nest
had a distinct tunnel entrance.
A second pair (pair 2) was purchased on November 1 ith, 1972, and
housed in an indoor flight cage adjoining that of pair 1, the cage
measuring 5 x 3 x 1^ feet and having access to an outdoor aviary
12 x 4 x 6 |feet. The rear half of the roof and sides of this aviary
were completely covered in and a further three feet of the roof was
also covered, while the rear half of the floor was concreted and the
front half planted.
This accommodation was shared with Turquoise and Blue-headed
Tanagers, zosterops, an Ixula and several other birds; the food
provided was the same as for pair 1 and the birds were allowed
access to the outdoor flights throughout the winter. Pair 2 started
early, an egg being laid on November n-i2th, but the first serious
attempt at nesting was seen on February 3rd when this pair started
building in a clump of conifer at about ij feet from the ground and
under the sheltered part of the flight. Because of the cold weather I
destroyed this nest on February 10th and a second nest was dealt with
in the same manner on March 13th. The hen of pair 2 was found dead
on May 24th and a search of the outside flight revealed a nest built
on the ground at the base of a flowering currant and containing
three eggs. The male of this pair was seen to be incubating so the nest
was left in the hope that he would continue, but it was found that
he roosted away from the nest and so, on May 28th, two of the eggs
were transferred to a Zebra Finch's nest and two of the Zebra Finch's
eggs put in their place, but none of them hatched.
Nesting activity with pair 1 was noticed on March 24th, but it was not
until June 7th that a nest with three eggs was found in a clump of heather.

On July 9th a further three eggs were found in the same nest, but it
is quite likely that they were in fact the same eggs and they were not
fertile. On July 17th, a further clutch was being incubated, but
without any hatching being observed. However, on September 4th,
when a search of the flight was made following the continued absence
of the hen, a nest with two chicks of about 4-5 days old was found
and on the 8th they were still alive and vigorous, but on the nth
the mother was found dead on the ground and the two chicks dead
in the nest. They were about 8-10 days old and their crops were
empty. I moved house a week or so later and do not know how many
nests had been built by this pair, but the nest that was used by them
for all the known breeding attempts was sited in a large clump of
heather. The structure, as already described, was globular and com-
posed of dry grass with some fresh green grass and in this case a
tunnel entrance of approximately two inches length--a typical nest
of Peters' Twinspot, I consider. It was noticed that this tunnel was
renovated during the course of the breeding season and another
point of interest was that the nest was built beneath a layer of dead
leaves that had lodged in the heather. Although no definite conclusion
could be drawn from a study of only two pairs, it would appear that
this twinspot may be double-brooded in nature and that, like the
Diamond Firetail Zonaeginthus guttalus, pairs differ regarding the
length and even existence of an entrance tunnel to the nest. Most of
the incubation by day was done by the hen, but she was relieved for
periods of about one hour by die cock. However, the hen alone incu-
bated the eggs at night, her mate roosting high up in the flight and,
as already described, the cock of pair 2 incubated during the day
after the loss of his mate, but would not do so at night.
The cock of pair 1 was observed hawking insects after the manner
of a flycatcher, but he was never seen in the vicinity of the nest after
the chicks hatched and from the fact that they died when the mother
did, it seems doubtful if he was assisting much in the feeding of them.

By Mats Tell (Ljungbyhed, Sweden)
A seven-year-old hen Turquoisine Grass Parrakeet Neophema
pulchella of mine used to nest in a conventional plywood box, but
this year I managed to get a decayed tree-trunk which had some
holes bored in it by a Lesser-spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus minor.
I put the log into the aviary in the last week of April thinking that,
as Turquoisines are fond of enlarging any holes they find in logs and
tree stumps, this would provide a more suitable nest site. However,
after she had investigated the several holes, she showed no further
interest in them and started digging holes under the rubber mats in

the shelter. She never completed these holes but instead she laid her
five eggs on the floor in a dark corner (Fig. 3). I find that the " green
grass parrakeets often lay and incubate on the aviary floor while
the " red " species usually are reluctant to do so. Although I have
yet to see a Splendid N. splendida incubate properly on the ground
it seems impossible to prevent Blue-wings N. chrysostomus and
Elegants N. elegans from breeding even in an aviary with no nest
boxes. Turquoisines will sometimes lay and incubate in hollows under
pieces of brick, old boards and suchlike. My Bourke's N. bourkii,
which are not true Neophemas, never show any interest in a rotten
log, unless it contains the completed nesting holes of woodpeckers,
and they practically never lay or incubate on the aviary floor.
Although it may not be invariable behaviour it is well known for
hen Splendids to carry pieces of leaves and grass blades into their nest
boxes tucked in their feathers. But, as far as I know, nothing has
been published about this behaviour in Turquoisines. The ground in
the aviary where my Turquoisines live is partially covered with tussocks
of the grass Poa annua. This weed is greatly appreciated by the
majority of my birds and so I was not surprised to find my hen
Turquoisine among these tussocks in the late evening more especially
as she regularly dew-bathes during dry periods. For some days I
ignored this but then noticed that she was actually biting off small
grass blades which were then tucked in her rump feathers, under the
wings and in the feathers of the flanks (Figs. 1 &amp; 2). After collecting
about a dozen she returned to the shelter. She repeated this every
evening during the first week of incubation. It is difficult to explain
the reason behind these attempts to line the nest since such small grass
blades dried very quickly and blew away as the sitting bird left the
nest. Perhaps they might do a better job in a cavity where the bird
has to climb up to the entrance hole. In this particular case the
poor Turquoisine had laid very close to the feeding shelf and twice
a day, which is when I feed the birds, she, being a nervous little
thing, hastily left the eggs. Not only were the eggs addled but after
a few days one could not find a single grass blade still inside the nest.
Now' she has laid again, this time in her old box. I would be most
grateful to know whether other breeders of Turquoisines have had a
similar experience? By the way, it is not true that Splendids only use
aromatic leaves; a hen in the collection of a friend prefers Heather
Calluna to any other plant.

Columbina cruziana
By Jeffrey Trollope (Hounslow, Middlesex)
This paper records aspects of the reproduction and behaviour of
captive C. cruziana , with special reference to vocalizations and
displays, which apparently have not yet been described, Goodwin
(1970). Some comparisons are made with C. talpacoti , Trollope (1974)
kept under similar conditions.
As usual with imported doves, they are known by many common
names; these include Peruvian Ground Dove, Gold-ringed Ground
Dove and Croaking Ground Dove. In dealers' lists they are often
called Yellow-billed Ground Dove, Yellow-billed Pigmy Dove and

Three males were received in August 1972 and two pairs in April
1973. The male of one pair was dead on arrival and the female died
two hours later. The surviving pair were in poor condition, but with
warmth and a varied diet they improved. A male from the three
received in 1972 and the surviving female were housed in an outdoor
aviary from May 30th until November 12th, 1973. This aviary
measured 12x8x8 feet and was planted with privet bushes. Clumps
of gorse were hung at various heights so as to provide nesting sites
and cover: bowl type baskets and half-open fronted boxes were also
provided.
Two pairs of waxbills, Uraeginthus bengalus and Estrilda subfiava,
a pair of Petronias Petronia xanthosterna , Chestnut Sparrows Sorella
eminibey and Rain Quail Coturnix coromandelica shared the same
aviary.
The doves were watched from the window of a nearby shed.
Description
(From five males and two females)
Sexual dimorphism in plumage and also size occurs, judged by the
small number measured and examined, plus 6 females and 8 males
observed in a dealer's premises, the overall length being 7J in. males,
6 f-y in. females, but no mention of sexual dimorphism in size has
been found in the literature.
Male: Bill about two thirds from the base is orange-yellow or bright
yellow; the remainder is black. There is some indication that the
yellow-orange area intensifies in colour when the males are in
breeding condition, the bill appearing to be thicker in this coloured
area in the male. Irides--outer zone red, then concentric zones of green,
yellowish-brown and brown, the orbital skin being pale yellow.
The head is bluish-grey (white on the chin), shading into brownish-
grey or paler bluish-grey. The closed wings show a reddish-purple

bar and a variable number of blue-black spots and blotches, while
outer secondaries and primaries are tipped with black. The breast
and underparts are pink. The outer tail feathers are tipped with black
(lacking in one male) and the feet and legs are pink.
Female: Bill--the bright yellow of the male is replaced by pale yellow.
I rides--outer zone of greyish-white, then concentric zones of orange-
red and pale yellow, the orbital skin being pale yellow.
The upper parts are light brown, shading into light grey or whitish-
grey below. A variable number of feathers have light buffy-brown
edging, mainly on the abdomen and under tail-coverts. The closed
wings show a similar but shorter reddish-purple bar as the male, with
a narrow upper margin of buffy-brown. The spots and blotches are
not so well defined and lighter in colour than in the males. The feet
and legs are pale pink.
Individual markings
One male had the crown and forehead coal black when received in
September, 1972, these areas became the usual bluish-grey after a
moult in February/March, 1973. Although such temporary melanism
is often seen in imported birds, the abnormally pigmented areas in
this case were unusually well defined and clear cut.
Young birds at 21 days
Bill--dark horn colour. Irides--dark brown with outer ring of
white. Head light grey, with whitish-grey around eyes and ear-coverts,
chin white. Upper parts light grey, shading into whitish-grey below.
A number of feathers show a light brown edging, mainly on the breast,
abdomen and wings; the under tail-coverts show feathers with cinna-
mon edging. The closed wings show a bar and spots, which are paler
and not as distinct as those of the hen. The feet and legs are pale
flesh colour.
Distribution and Habitat
In the wild the birds occur from coastal Ecuador to N. Chile,
extending east in Peru to valley of Maranon. They are found in arid
scrub, oases and gardens (De Schauensee 1971).

Food and Feeding

<bodyText confidence="0.999688909090909" page_id="56470949"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
The seeds available were plate yellow, pearl white and panicum
millets, hemp, rape, niger, maw and small canary seeds. As observed
with C. talpacoti, it would appear that only the smaller seeds were
eaten. Wheat and dari were also offered but ignored.
Ground cuttlefish bone, fine oystershell, grit sand and Kilpatrick's
Pigeon Minerals were always available. The food, water, minerals etc.
were placed in pots on the floor and on a feeding platform 4 ft. 6 in.
off the ground, sand was thrown on the aviary floor two or three
times a week. Although no data were collected, it would appear that
more time was spent feeding on the ground than from the platform.

to " peck-dig " with the bill when seed is observed. They also make
a sideways sweeping motion with the bill in the " normal " vertical
position, thus scattering seed, when feeding at a container.
Breeding
A pair were released into the aviary on May 30th, 1973, the cock
immediately began to chase the hen, giving the wing-flick display,
but nest building did not commence until July.
Nest
Three nests were used for six clutches, no. 2 was selected on four
occasions. (Table 1.) Two or three days before the nest was built, the
cock would sit in the site, nest calling and wing-flicking. He would
turn around and press down any existing material, such as gorse, thus
making a shallow depression. When nest building commenced, he
picked up material from the floor and flew to the site, the hen making
the nest.
In four cases the nest was built on top of an oblong flat-topped
nest box, screened by gorse (no. 2). Sites 1 and 3 were in clumps of
gorse, the highest was 7 ft. and the lowest 4 ft. 6 in. The nest materials
consisted of dried grasses and fine roots. Twigs provided were ignored.
The nests were not substantial structures like those built by C. talpacoti ,
but a little new material was added on two occasions when the same
nest was used again.

Eggs

<bodyText confidence="0.987974428571429" page_id="56470950"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
The eggs were glossy white short ellipticals, three laid by the adult
hen measured 22.9 x 18.3, 23.4 x 18.00, 22.4 x 17.2 mm. An egg laid
by a young hen when 105 days old, measured 22.2 x 17.3 mm.
Incubation
Both sexes sat on the nest before the first egg was laid. When
incubation commenced, they sat very " tight ", lowering themselves
in the nest when I approached. The first nest (no. 1), was built in

a gorse clump near the feeding stations, so when attending to the
water pots, etc., I could have touched the sitting bird by stretching
out my hand. This nest was the lowest site and the most successful. I
think the desertions of eggs in nest 2, and of chicks in nest 3 happened
because these sites were higher, nearer the aviary roof and the
desertions were caused by the regular attentions of local cats.
Incubation commenced with the second egg in two clutches (nos.
1 and 5) and with the first in clutch no. 6. The hen sat at night, and
the cock's share of diurnal incubation seems to be similar to that
described for C. talpacoti. One of the many " change overs " ob-
served during incubation were as follows. The hen flew to the clump
of gorse containing the nest, alighting about 18 in. away from the
nest, in visual contact with the cock. She manipulated a few grass
stems in the gorse with her bill. The cock then began to wing-flick,
bow and give the nest call. The hen then alighted on the nest edge,
he pushed the eggs with the underside of his bill and flew away to
feed. She settled on the eggs and began to push and adjust the eggs
with the underside of her bill; then she made a complete turn ending
in the same position as she started from, preened her breast feathers
for a few seconds, and began to incubate.
Chicks
As far as could be ascertained the chicks hatched on the same day.
The nest was checked twice a day, a.m. and p.m., the last check being
carried out as late in the day as possible. The brooding of the chicks
was performed by both sexes, and as with incubation the hen sat
at night. The change over times were irregular during the day,
without the fairly consistent pattern observed during incubation
when the cock sat from morning until late afternoon.
Both sexes were seen feeding the chicks with a gentle " pigeon
pumping " motion, while they were carrying out their respective turns
at brooding. One of the change overs observed during the brooding
period, began with the hen flying near the nest and manipulating
some stems in the gorse with her bill. She then flew to the nest and
pecked gently on the cock's back. He stood up on the edge of the
nest and fed both chicks and then left the nest: the hen looked down
at the chicks and commenced brooding them. Although the cock was
noted on the nest with the hen twice during the brooding period
(apparently covering one chick each), " dual " chick brooding was
not frequently observed, as with C . talpacoti . It would appear the
chicks were covered constantly until they were 7 days old (nest 1),
then both parents would spend some time off the nest during the day.
The chicks left the nest on the same day, they could both fly up
to the perches and there was little disparity in their size and activity.
The parents had built a new nest and laid again, but the eggs were
deserted. Roosting was a social affair, and parents and chicks would

clump together in a line along a perch, with the chicks between the
parents. When they were 20 days old the chicks were seen feeding
themselves, but the chick which later proved to be a male was seen
soliciting food from the cock. He followed the cock on the ground
giving wing-flick, and when the cock stopped he adopted a soliciting
posture. The young were removed from their parents at 25 days.
Their bills were then showing a lighter patch in the area which is
yellow in the adults.
The young were transferred to a bird room and housed in a box
cage 4 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. x 5 ft. Later in the year the cock was nest-
calling and chasing the hen and a crude nest of paper was built in a
hanging seed pot. The hen laid an egg in this " nest " when 105 days
old and began to incubate. The egg was removed and the cock
transferred to another cage. The chicks of the unsuccessful brood
(nest 3), were dead in the nest seven days from hatching. They showed
a disparity in size, which was noticeable from the second day of life.
(Fig. 1)
Displays
The wing-flick display (as noted with C. talpacoti) is given by both
sexes. The cock gives the display when he approaches or is being
approached by the hen, also when nest calling. It is always accom-
panied by a head nod in the nest-calling situation (Fig. 2). The head
is lowered and the tail elevated and one or both wings are flicked.
This nest-calling display is a very good signal. The bars on the wings
and the orange-yellow bill are very noticeable when moved during
nest-calling.

On one occasion the cock was seen following the hen (both birds
were walking on the aviary floor) and he gave a series of very " deep "
bows, the bill nearly touching the floor. His posture was upright and
he had a bold " larger than normal " look, without any overt feather
erection. (Fig. 3.)
Fig-3
The hen wing-flicks sometimes when approaching the cock and
often when standing or sitting in the nest site. She will manipulate
stems with her bill, call and wing-flick to the cock, when he approaches
the nest with materials. The wing-flick and nest-calling bow were
given by a young cock when 90 days old. He was sitting in the seed-pot
nest, previously described.

and when the birds are perched, is preceded by allo-preening, dis-

placement preening and billing. The displacement preening is usually
a rapid movement of the head, the bill is pushed between the side of
the body and the wing, then withdrawn. The breast is also preened
in the hurried manner. Billing consists of the pair briefly touching
bills and sometimes bill-fencing, the female's bill momentarily entering
the male's.
When housed with quail in box cages, the doves will often lift one
wing in " defensive threat " when approached by a quail.
Voice
C. cruziana has a varied range of vocalizations with a marked
sexual difference in the calls.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.590194">
Male calls
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924771375" page_id="56470954"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
The nest calling vocalization is a rather drawn out tri-syllabic
" P w--aaa--up ", the " spare " cocks will often sit in seed pots and
wing-flick, while giving this call.
The advertising calls are variable and four different " variations "
can be identified. An independent observer was asked to consider
these calls without prior briefing and agrees that four variations can
be distinguished. The responsibility for the written descriptions is
mine. The four calls are :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.591964" page_id="56470954"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
1. " W--WUWK " 2. " W--OUWK "

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995851833333333" page_id="56470954"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
The cocks also give a call, which I can only describe as the grating
noise sometimes heard when a very heavy wooden door is being
slowly closed. The situations in which this call is given would lead
one to suppose it is an alarm call, certainly it is difficult to pin-point.
The bill is opened when the cocks give the nest and advertising calls,
but not when they give the grating " alarm " call.

Female calls
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991754785714286" page_id="56470954"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
Three vocalizations have been recorded for hens. The first is a
rather " mewing " drawn out " ME-aap", the second is " Me-
HAP, HAP, HAP, HAP ", this has the same " mewing " quality with
the rapid ending. The first call is given by the hen when she approaches
or has been approached by the cock, and has been followed by wing-
flicks, allo-preening and billing. The second when she is at the nest
site and the cock has been bringing material or has approached to
take his turn at brooding or incubation. A third call given by hens
is a soft low " Maa--waaa ", when the birds are nervous or anxious.
Sun-bathing
C. cruziana , like C. talpacoti is an inveterate sun-bather; on any
sunny day the pair in the aviary would sit close together on the
aviary floor, exposing their dorsal surfaces to the sun. However, no
wing-lift or other sun-bathing posture has been observed.

Dust-bathing
Dust-bathing is of frequent occurrence, often stimulated when I
throw sand on the aviary floor, although they also use loose dry soil
and dust. The birds squat in the substrate then rub alternate sides
of the body in the soil or sand with a hurried scuffling motion.
Peck-digs and lateral movements of the bill, similar to those seen
when the doves are feeding were also observed. The longest period
recorded of continuous dust-bathing was 8 minutes. On one occasion
when the cock was dust-bathing he began to give the nest call and
wing-flick to the hen, who was in visual contact. She flew down and
began to dust-bathe with him.
Apart from the Bare-faced Ground Dove Metriopelia cecilae ,
Nicolai, (1962) there is apparently no other record for dust-bathing in
Columbidae. Goodwin (1970) points out that the fondness of species
such as Turtle Doves and Diamond Doves for lying on the ground
to sun themselves, has led to incorrect records for dust-bathing.

Water-bathing has been observed on ten occasions, in each case
the birds were housed in box cages in the bird room. The birds
fluff out their ventral and lateral feathers and immerse their ventral
surface in the water. Rapid dipping movements are made with the
bill and the face, ventral and lateral surfaces become wet. Rain-
bathing has not been observed and unlike C. talpacoti no posture

Summary
The reproduction and behaviour of captive C. cruziana is described.
Preliminary results indicate that C. cruziana could be a free
breeding species in captivity, with early sexual maturation.

At the time of writing I am in the process of moving from Madrid,
to Caracas, Venezuela. I am approaching the end of a five-year tour
with my company, and am about to begin a new one, this time
hopefully for three years only. During my sojourn in Spain I have
lived for most of the time in a rented house. This fact, combined with
a lot of travel, has meant that I have been unable to develop any
permanent or meaningful collection of birds : I have not been able
to build an aviary, for example. This has not stopped me from keeping
birds, however, and a large room at the top of the house has been
devoted to birds ever since we moved in. During this period I have
never missed an opportunity to buy any unusual or hitherto " un-
known " species. I have managed to acquire well over 100 species
of birds, and have enjoyed that most satisfying of all avicultural
experiences . . . that of breeding several species (but all easy ones!).
A couple of dozen species have hailed from South America, and
since I hope to be able to expand this side of my bird life considerably
very soon, I will restrict these notes to the species native to Spain. I
made a list of all the Spanish species that I had kept and was
astounded to realise that it totalled 75. I suspect that I have led a
very Butlerian life of late . . . keeping lots of birds in zoo-bird-house
conditions but rarely giving them any kind of really suitable en-
closures. I have always thought that A. G. Butler's bird room must
have been like a dealer's shop. Well, maybe the reader should hold my
notes in similar light, for I have not kept many of these birds for
long periods--rarely over a year.
Finally, I should explain what I have done with them. The prime
objective was to sketch them, paint them when possible, and simply
to gain wider experience. As a member of ASPEBA I was able to
take the odd pair of particularly interesting birds to England (amusing
the Spanish customs officials at my British eccentricity), and this
activity has resulted in quite a few successful first breedings (mostly
recorded in A.M.) and several rare breedings (sadly not recorded--
yet anyway).
I will not list every species, but pick out the more interesting ones
--or those where I have something vaguely of interest to relate--
grouping them by type. There are some species that will receive
much more attention than others.
Among the seed-eaters, the buntings have provided the most interest
and most surprises. In the Madrid bird market one Sunday morning
I saw an itinerant countryman with a few cages of mixed seed-eaters.
They included three Little Buntings Emberiza pusilla and I was
assured that all his birds had been caught locally--indeed imported/

dealer birds never cost less than 150 pesetas each (about #1 at the
time) and I bought all three of these for 75 pesetas the lot. In the
same way I bought a male Yellow-breasted Bunting. This bird was in
fresh winter plumage and I could not believe it was what it was. I
sent a coloured sketch off to my friend Derek Goodwin who confirmed
immediately that it was Emberiza aureola. It was about this time
(the winter of 1971) that a member of our local Nature Society
reported seeing five Yellow-breasted Buntings in the mountains north
of Madrid.
Ortolan Buntings Emberiza hortulana became firm favourites. Ex-
tracts from entries in my bird journal include :
"Pair bought in the Rastro for 250 pesetas, mid-November, 1971.
Put them in a roomy wire cage--with a pair of Siskins--in my office.
They seem sedate and fairly calm birds, never panicking or fussing.
They take canary seed almost exclusively, picking only a few other
seeds, but not much else.
"November 16th. Saw male Ortolan peck at, and hold onto one
of the Siskins until its fluttering pulled it free, leaving the victor looking
smug--with a feather in its bill. As I had seen the female threaten a
Siskin on another occasion I took the Siskins away and kept them
with a pair of Serins. The Ortolans look rather comic with their
mutton chop moustachios. The difference between the male and female
is very clear--but very subtle. I feel sure that a winter plumage male
could well be taken for a female, in the field.
"Seed pots contained : canary mixture, rape, millet, lettuce, canary
and millet, and oats. Canary and millet preferred. Cuttlefish bone
crudely crushed and scattered on floor of cage. Both birds enjoy it,
especially female who picks a lump of the size of a bean and con-
tentedly chews away for ages. Birds brought home from office (where
they had a "day" of about 16 hours) and went into a large box
cage at home, on normal winter day length. This knocked the male
off song and both birds began moulting on the head." These birds
eventually went to England for ASPEBA study, and I'm happy to say
that they eventually bred, in the care of Mr. J. F. Dowling (A.M. 1973,
P . 167).
Corn Buntings Emberiza calandra are still common in Spain, but it
is only occasionally that one sees them in captivity. The first time I
ever saw one in the market I bought it instantly. It was an enormous
bird seemed to be very slow and clumsy, and its nape was very full
and ruffled. With hindsight I could tell that the bird was unwell, for
it was dead the next morning. An entry in my journal regarding a
rather more successful occasion :
"Autumn 1972. Bought a pair in the Rastro. Male noticeably larger
than female, and much calmer. Female had broken wing, hanging
down, and was very wild and terribly panicky. I bound her wing

in place with sellotape, gave a large bowl of multi-vitaminised water,
covered cage floor with a lot of seed and covered the cage for a
few days. The seed mixture consisted of all the usual seeds, including
cracked wheat, corn, sunflower, etc. Inside this covered cage the two
birds were totally calm and remained undisturbed by my movements
around. I changed the water and added more seed every three
days. At this rate the female had the minimum amount of disturbance.
I re-taped the wing after about a week and took the tape off altogether
a week later. Some 6 weeks later the pair were released into a small
flight and to my delight the female flew--not very well admittedly,
but fly she did."
For three years running I was tempted to buy Rock Buntings
Emberiza cia , and successfully kept probably a dozen or more during
this period. However, they were always either odd cocks or couples
of hens. I would negotiate, say, a trio of nice females from a cage
of Goldfinches for about 35 pence the lot, and about three months
later release them because no male had turned up, and I needed the
cage for something new. Sure enough, the next month I would be
offered a couple of males.
Never having kept a separate pair over a long period of time in
mixed company I cannot say how aggressive they might become. But
in my limited experience they were remarkably peaceful and easy-to-
keep birds. A couple of males in a large cage with some Rock
Sparrows and something else were in full song^ but not at all
aggressive. They seemed to be content with canary mixture and millet
seeds. When rearing, however, they become as insectivorous as any
bunting and I have watched them feeding grasshoppers to newly
fledged young on many occasions.

Breeding of Black-Footed and Humboldt&apos;s Penguins in Berlin Zoo
During the last 10 years there were hatched several Black-footed
and Humboldt's Penguins in the caves of their enclosure (1966 : 3
Black-footed and 2 Humboldt's; 1971 : 2 Humboldt's; 1972 : 1 Black-

footed), but only in 1966 were we successful in raising the young.
From 1967 to 1970 there were eggs, but shortly after having been laid
they disappeared, which may be due to the gulls and cormorants living
also in the enclosure. Two Humboldt's Penguins hatched in 1971 died
after 9 and 11 days. In the following year there hatched 1 Black-
footed Penguin that lived for about 3 months. In 1973 nothing hap-
pened, but now, in 1974, our penguins are breeding again and with
success. In 4 caves cut in sandstone, approximately 70 cm long, 35 cm
wide and about 50 cm high, the penguins started in March to collect
twigs and paper thrown into the enclosure by visitors. On this material
they laid their eggs and of 4 clutches one was of 2 eggs; the others
contained only one each. After an incubation period of one month
there hatched on April 30th, May 2nd and May 7th three Humboldt's
Penguins. Four eggs were laid by Humboldt's Penguins, one by the
Black-footed. At the beginning of July, two months after thev
were hatched, the young penguins left their caves for the first time
in the early evening. Now they are 2^ months old and seem to be
healthy. They are fed exclusively on fresh herrings and, of course,
while the young were being fed the number of fish consumed in-
creased by some 60%.
No additional vitamins or other medicaments have been given,
but to guard against malaria, all the penguins are given # tablet daily
of Primaquine (Bayer) during July and August.

Mr. P. D. W. McCarthy writes to say that a Greater Flamingo
arrived in Pegwell Bay, Kent, on June 19 and was joined by a second
on June 25. Both birds are well coloured and might, he thinks, be wild
ones. They appear to have settled there and have no difficulty in
finding sufficient food in tidal pools and the sea.
Pie also says that there are now seven feral Indian Ring-necked
Parrakeets in the Ramsgate area coming to feed at a bird table, but
also eating unripe apples and rowan berries. There is a family of six
and they were recently joined by another adult. ;
British Birds reports the presence of feral Ring-necked in south-
west Essex, as many as 22 being seen at one time. !

Parrots, feeding on the blue-black plum-like fruits of the Incense trees
(. Pachylobus ). When at Sotik, below Lake Victoria, more than twenty
years ago, she was brought two chicks which she reared on a mixture of
crumbled brown bread, hard-boiled egg and apple, one of these chicks
being still alive today. They became very tame and stayed about the
house, being given a shower bath each morning on the lawn by means
of a watering can rose, but they could not safely be left unattended in
the garden because of hawks. She had six birds at one time, but they
did not breed any until some five years later, the nests being partly
ready-made of bunches of long grass fixed high up in secluded places
in bushes and trees in the aviaries, the birds adding a few sticks and
using the same nest for a second brood. The two white eggs of the usual
clutch were incubated in turn by both parents, the incubation period
being 21 days. Dog meal made crumbly moist, fruit, hard-boiled egg
and green food were the foods provided and her birds have so far bred
to the second generation. She says that the Ross's Turacos of the Sotik
Kericho district can be sexed by the difference in the casque of male
and female, but the birds from the Cheringani area near the Uganda
border are identical in appearance.

Mr. Paul E. Schneider, of Riverside, California, writes : We had a
rather good year. My wife hand-fed five African Greys, five Grand
Eclectus, two Citron-crested Cockatoos, five Bare-eyed Cockatoos (2
nests, 3 and 2), plus a few other smaller species. With the exception of
the Eclectus, which were raised from the incubator, all the others were
left ten days to two weeks in the nest before taking them. A number of
birds were raised outright in the aviaries by the various parents.
In the January 4, 1974, edition of the Los Angeles Times there was
an article, date-line Sydney, stating that there was " a plan by Austra-
lian officials to poison one million kangaroos by putting arsenic in their
watering holes In Perth, A. R. Tomlinson, Chief Executive Officer
of the West Australian Agricultural Protection Board, said that the
kangaroos must be destroyed to conserve other life. I think arsenic
in water holes would destroy not only the kangaroos but " other life "
as well. If this is correct, I think all organisations should vehemently
protest to the Australian Government at this method of reducing the
numbers of kangaroos.

A prime nesting locale for birds of prey has become a National
Audubon Society Sanctuary. The society is leasing, for a token $1.00
a year, a 12,000 acre area north of Greeley, Colorado, near the Wyom-

one of the west's most productive nesting areas for Prairie Falcons,
Golden Eagles and several other raptors. The property is owned by a

at the end of 1973 he succeeded in getting the "rare" Madagascar
Mannikin, Bib Finch or Dwarf Mannikin, Lonchura, Spermestes, or
Lepidopygia nana and now has 27 young ones. He goes on to say that
his Diggles' Finches Poephila cincta atropygialis had nine young in one
brood and all have been successfully reared.
Never so commonly imported into Europe as its compatriot, the
Madagascar Lovebird Agapornis cana, the mannikin is indeed rare in

the collection has reached a total of 4,361 specimens of 274 species of
53 families. During 1973, 141 birds of 13 species were successfully
reared, among them two Emus, the eggs being artificially incubated!
and the chicks hand-reared. Notable breedings include 3 Rosy Fla-

BIRDS OF THE EDWARD MARSHALL BOEHM AVIARIES. By
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990154705882353" page_id="56470965"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
Charles Everitt. Published by Edward Marshall Boehm Inc.,
Trenton, New Jersey. No price shown.
This is a story rather than a text book. It is a story of the famous
collection of birds which was kept to provide living models for the
work of the late Edward Marshall Boehm.
As it states on the cover, this collection was primarily of softbills but
many other families are described including parrots, pigeons, cranes,
waders and gallinaceous birds. It does not set out to be all embracing
for any one family but deals in interesting detail with the species which
were actually kept. Mr. Everitt thus writes from personal experience
and not hearsay--a common fault with so many authors who try
to be comprehensive and in so doing copy the mistakes of others.
The book has three forewords by no less famous personalities than
the late Sir Edward Halstrom, Dr. Jean Delacour and Kenton C. Lint
of San Diego Zoo.
Then come chapters on the aviaries, feeding methods and breeding
records, followed by 12 chapters each dealing with the different

species kept. These include examples from almost every group of
birds known to aviculture. I found the descriptions of the aviaries
fascinating. What one can do with unlimited funds! Particularly
interesting was the way in which the huge planted aviaries were
covered in transparent plastic sheeting during the winter thus trans-
forming them into tropical houses. This was removed in the spring,
allowing the birds the benefit of sunshine, rain and fresh air for the
summer. Thus they had the best of both worlds. This innovation
could be copied in Britain and one would not need the elaborate
shelters which we have to build and which so often the birds do not
use anyway.
Mr. Everitt's description of the birds is accurate without being
boring. Where a species was bred he gives us much useful and valu-
able information.
The book is well illustrated with excellent photographs in colour
as well as black and white, not only of the birds themselves
but some of the exquisite porcelain sculptures for which the name
of Edward Marshall Boehm will ever be famous.
This is a book to be recommended to every aviculturist. Its first
appeal will naturally be to those interested primarily in softbills, but
the story it has to tell has something in it for everyone.

THE SEA AND THE ICE : A NATURALIST IN ANTARCTICA.
By Louis J. Halle. Michael Joseph, London, 1974. #4.50.
286 pp. and 28 black-and-white photographs.
This volume presents an eminently readable and well-informed
personal narrative of a journey from New Zealand to the South Pole
and back made by an American who is an amateur ornithologist and
(currently) a Professor of international studies in Geneva. He displays
both a scientifically enquiring brain and an aesthetically sensitive
heart.
He puts into print for the first time some additional records of
skuas in the interior of the great white continent and quotes, among
others, records of this venturesome predator at the South Pole and at
the Russian station Vostock.
While we may sympathise with Halle's being a taxonomic " lumper "
rather than a " splitter ", we can't allow him to lump the Brown Skua
and the South Polar Skua as forms of the same species. Near the north
end of the Antarctic Peninsula, if nowhere else, they live sympatrically
and behave as good species. That the Brown Skua of the South is
nonspecific with the Great Skua of the North Atlantic is much more
likely. To the list of places given by Halle where the northern bird
nests must be added Scotland. He is also a little out of date on the
number of full species of penguins, now reckoned by most authorities
to be eighteen, not seventeen.

That Wilson's Storm Petrel, contrary to what the identification
books try to tell us, can't in Halle's view be identified in the field by
feet that extend beyond the tail or by yellow webs between the toes,
confirms Bernard King's recent observations of the species in the Bay
of Biscay in the southern winter. The photograph of this species on
p. 102 is perhaps the most useful of the 28 in the book. The most
pleasing is Roger Peterson's study of the Snow Petrel in flight.
Halle was profoundly affected by his visit to the Pole. " What I
wanted to do, beyond all measure of desire, was to walk away forthwith
over the endless plain, all the way to McMurdo; for in this world of
divinity I could hardly imagine that it would not be a glory all the
way. But the little boy was safely encased in the grown man, who
managed to keep him under control." How distressing to have to
reflect also that chemical pollution has at last spread even to the snow
that falls on the South Pole !
More than 90% of the world's ice is locked up in Antarctica, where
it has taken at least 20,000 years to accumulate, and where it covers
an area twice the size of Europe. These and other stunning facts are
brought out in this pleasing volume. One last one : the man whose j
wife Adele is commemorated in the name of the Adelie Penguin was I
also the man who, twenty years earlier, had discovered the Venus i
de Milo!

Temporary Blindness of a Male Shining Honeycreeper
In October, 1973 I acquired a pair of Shining Honeycreepers Cyanerpes
lucidus , newly imported and very young--so young that neither bird was wholly
independent. In colouring there was little to choose between them, both being
green-backed and faintly barred, with buff-olive fronts, yellow legs and, of
course, decurved bills. The cock bird began to acquire the adult plumage very
rapidly; the characteristic blue developed with the distinctive black bib and
tail and the yellow of the underwings gave way to black. The flight which
housed the pair was supplied with dual drinkers and duplicated supplies of
fruit and other food.
At the beginning of May it was noticed that the male began to sit near a
a drinker of liquid honey food and he became very uncertain of perching.

The female started what could be described as 'dive bombing' flights which
unsettled him even more, so they were separated. The cock found it very
difficult to locate food and when he did he made several attempts to find the
honey reservoir; also his perching was now very precarious, so that rather
than fly from perch to perch he sidled along a twig and then back to the
food supply and when he toppled from a perch he was able to grope his way
back by scrambling up a piece of bark strategically placed. I felt it advisable
to leave things like that as he was getting a certain amount of exercise. Instead
of his usual varied diet of grapes, orange, pear and honey sponge as well as
the honey mixture, he concentrated on the orange and honey mixture. It
became obvious that he was blind and any alteration to his accustomed sur-
roundings caused distress and a complete inability to locate a new source of
food. It became necessary to hand-feed him; he was completely unaware of
my hand, so was easily caught and he became very trusting, drinking and
eating readily from food containers into which his beak was dipped. Examina-
tion with a glass revealed no opacity and certainly no obvious damage, for
the eyes were bright and clear. I decided to hand-feed him on the honey
mixture to which was added massive doses of Abidec and Hydramin and it
was after more than a month of this treatment that he began to perch more
firmly and to regain his sight and confidence to forage for himself. He is now
a perfect bird but after his recovery he would attack the hen if they were put
together in the same flight, which made me wonder whether she was the
'territorial&apos; culprit in the first instance. Now they are more reconciled and
have been playing with such nesting material as fine grasses; also their diet
has extended to such items as soft cheese and even lettuce leaves.

An Aggressive Talpacoti Dove
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.992626769230769" page_id="56470968"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
This may prove of some interest following Mr. Jeffrey Trollope's most
informative article on the Talpacoti Dove in the May-June issue of the
Magazine.
This spring I was able to obtain a mate for a male of this species that had
been in my aviaries for some time. They soon went to nest and hatched a
single chick; the other egg failed to hatch, although fertile. At this stage I
went away for a couple of weeks. On my return, I found the hen Talpacoti
had been attacked by the cock, and badly scalped; of the chick there was no
sign. Within a few days they had laid again and this time hatched both eggs.
When the young were twelve days old, the cock was seen furiously driving
his mate about the aviary, pecking her savagely about the head at every
opportunity. I immediately removed him to an adjoining aviary and I am
certain that, had I not acted, the young would have shared the fate of their
elder sibling. Both young left the nest the following day, and one was fully
reared by the mother; the other disappeared the day after leaving the nest. The
young bird was removed to another aviary three weeks after fledging, and its
parents re-united. An identical series of events proceeded with the third brood,
except that two young were fully reared.
In view of the above, it would appear advisable to watch Talpacoti cocks
closely when young are due to leave the nest.
Two years ago I possessed a solitary female Bare-eyed Ground Dove
(Metriopelia ceciliae ). This bird produced four clutches of eggs in a season,
all infertile, mated to a male Talpacoti Dove. Unfortunately she died before
I was able to obtain a male of her own species. If any member of the Society
has any Metriopelia, I would be most interested to hear of their experiences
with them.

A Viviparous Budgerigar?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992182" page_id="56470969"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
In one of my outdoor aviaries I noticed one day during the first week in
February, 1974, a cinnamon green Budgerigar hen looking unwell. I examined
her carefully for egg-binding, for she was swollen as if this were the case,
and put her into a hospital cage heated to a high temperature. Nothing hap-
pened that day, but next morning when I went to see if she had laid an egg
I found two perfectly formed chicks in the water container (about o.\ x i  |x 1^
ins. deep) one larger than the other and with black down, while the other
had less down of a paler shade. There was no sign of any shell and the hen
had recovered, though she died shortly after, never again appearing really
fit. This seems an extraordinary happening, for not only did the hen produce
unshelled chicks, but these appeared to have developed beyond the normal
hatching stage, as, of course, Budgerigars are born quite naked. There were no
nestboxes in the aviary and nowhere the hen could have sat without my seeing
her, nor could I have missed finding the chicks if they had somehow been
entangled in her feathers or under her wings.

IDENTIFICATION, CARE AND BREEDING OF

By Rosemary Low (New Barnet, Herts.)
Identification of the many subspecies of Trichoglossus haematodus 9
due to their numbers and the close resemblance of some forms, must
have caused more confusion to aviculturists than that of any other
parrots. During the past three or four years the number, both of
individuals and of species, of the Loriinae imported has increased
greatly, with a corresponding growth in their popularity. There must
be many owners of Trichoglossus haematodus lorikeets who are unable
to identify the subspecies in their possession. Some descriptions found
in the older avicultural works could apply equally well to several forms
and there is little in modern popular literature to be of assistance in
the matter of identification. The most helpful paper, although identifi-
cation is not its primary aim, is that by A. J. Cain ( Ibis vol. 97 (1955)
pp. 432-479). I do not know of any other detailed study of this species.
I have therefore prepared the chart in the hope that it will prove
useful for identification purposes. Names of breeders (from published
reports) are also given. Records for the less known forms are conspicu-
ous by their absence. Undoubtedly, this is partly due to the difficulty
of identification; some successes listed under forsteni and mitchelli, for
example, could well belong elsewhere. I would be most grateful to any
member who can inform me of additional breeding successes with birds
in their possession, with the exception of those relating to the Swain-
son's (Rainbow or Blue Mountain Lorikeet) which has been bred so
often that I have not listed breeders.
It should be noted that in all subspecies the bill is orange-red in the
adult and normally black in newly fledged birds. The iris is red in
adults.
The lorikeets under discussion usually nest readily, the main problem
being that common with so many species of parrots--obtaining a true
pair. If one reads the earlier aviculturists such as A. G. Butler, " larger
head and bill " is given as a means of distinguishing male parrots of
nearly all species. This is far from being so with a great number of
parrots, but I believe it to be true of the majority of lories, thus giving
the male a rather bolder appearance. Both male and female may

display but the male's display is usually more exaggerated, especially
when arching the neck and hissing.
However, some or all adults of at least one subspecies of T. haema-
todus are sexually dimorphic. In mitchelli , the red feathers of the
breast are edged with green or yellow in the female; the male's breast
is completely red. Similarly, some specimens of capistratus can be
sexed by the colouring of the breast feathers. In the female, some of
the feathers are edged with green, while the male shows some red on
the breast. I would be grateful to receive confirmation or denial of this
point from any member who has bred capistratus.
Most true pairs of lories will make an attempt to nest. They do not
require a large aviary; a good size for Trichoglossus species is, in my
opinion, 12 ft. long, 3 ft. 6 in. wide and 6 ft. high. Peat is the most
suitable floor covering, preferably on a concrete base. Welded mesh,
1 inch square and painted black, is the best type of wire mesh for
lorikeet aviaries. All my lories have open-fronted shelters; they invari-
ably use their next-box to roost in so that elaborate shelters are un-
necessary.
Lories are not fussy about nesting sites and usually accept any box
of a reasonable size. Most breeders use boxes about 13 inches to 15
inches high and 9 inches square; peat is the most suitable nesting
material. Two eggs almost invariably form the clutch; rarely the
number is three.
Many Trichoglossus lorikeets are nervous incubators, the hen appear-
ing from the box at the smallest disturbance. However, they are usually
quick to return. On more than one occasion breeders have recorded
never finding the breeding pair in the nest-box; this is quite possible if
there is a concealed approach to the aviary, as the hen could leave as
soon as footsteps are heard, and be sitting unconcernedly on the perch
in the presence of the owner.
The incubation period is 25 or 26 days. The young normally spend
80-87 days in the nest-box but some breeders have recorded young
fledging when between 50 and 60 days old. When hatched the chicks
are covered in white fluff which is replaced by thick dark grey down
by the time they are one month old.
Obviously, the diet must be as nutritious as possible while the chicks
are being reared. In addition to a nectar food, which is the staple diet,
the following foods have been consumed by pairs rearing young : apple,
banana, chickweed, sowthistle, spinach beet, gentles, sunflower, canary
seed and spray millet.

LARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995901575" page_id="56470984"  page_num="205" year="" vol="">
A very popular cage bird throughout Spain is the Calandra Lark
Melanocorypha calandra. Every year, about March and April, two
or three experienced old hands catch a few dozen or more and sell
them in the Madrid Sunday morning market. The males are superb
songsters but the females, being voiceless, are rarely available, though
of course the old females with good throat patches get sold as males.
These birds are offered at prices ranging from #i to #2 depending on
supply and demand. Later on however, from June to August, hand-
reared nestlings and fledglings appear. These range in price from #2
for week-old nestlings to #20 for weaned young males. I have kept
several Calandras--of both sexes and all ages--and have found them
rather variable in their reaction to captivity. Adult birds remained
nervous for much longer than any other lark (or pipit), and several
never seemed to be happy. Immatures (wild-caught, not hand-reared)
invariably settled well. Adults would usually fly up vertically when
alanned, a habit that the young birds rarely indulged in.
My notes in 1970 include " . . . Not apparently interested in meal-
worms or grasshoppers. Canary mixture and water." A note in 1971
reads, " The new Calandra is extremely big and bold, bigger than any
I remember last year. When alarmed he runs to the corner of his cage
and stands facing into it, head up looking back. He is in with a Crested
Lark and some Rock Sparrows. When I throw in the mealworms he is
the first to grab one now, and will take a couple very quickly--quite
overcoming his fear of me. His nails are very long and impressive, but
the bird is much more lark-like than the Steinbacher or Singer
sketches." In 1972 I bought an adult male and released it in the bird
room. It had had the flight feathers of the right wing completely clipped,
effectively preventing the bird from flying at all. It was an ideal bird
for its environment, and became quite tame and steady by my judicious
dispersal of mealworms.
In the spring of 1970 one of the local trappers brought me a cage
full of Short-toed Larks and Lesser Short-toed Larks Calandrella
cinerea, and C. rufescens, both adult and immature. A brief diary
entry made about that time reads, . . can separate immatures of both
species by patterning on crown. Adult Short-toed resembles an im-
mature Calandra but smaller and more delicate. Fantastically easy to
keep, even in a small cage and crowded. Neyer lost one. Chirrup and
warble under quite adverse conditions. Fed on only canary mixture
and water."
Delightful as these birds were they had to be cleared out for Bee-

eaters and Rollers, and were released along with a collection of similar
fortunates like Crested Larks and Rock Sparrows.
En masse, these birds are chirpy and interesting little creatures, but
single birds remain nervous. An odd bird that I have at the time of
writing will always run to the corner of its (roomy) cage and face into
the corner, head up, just like a Galandra did. When disturbed it will
run about, make flight-intention jumps, and eventually end up in
another corner. I saw some Lesser Short-toed in a large collection in
the Canary Islands. The floors of their flights were mainly concrete and
the feet of the birds were in very bad condition, balled with food and
excreta. These Canary Islands birds were much paler and more evenly
marked than the peninsular birds that I remembered.
Another species of lark that I found to be inordinately easy to keep
under any conditions was the Crested Lark Galerida cristata. My
journal contains the following entry, " They are very easy to keep, take
mealworms but not with the alacrity of the other birds they have been
kept with (Petronias, Rock Buntings, etc.), and take most of the seeds
given. They tend to be restless, especially when nervous. On several
occasions I have watched from a hidden position and seen the other
species sitting restfully, often singing. The Crested Lark will sing a few
stanzas, stretch its wings, run about a bit, sing a few stanzas, etc. On
one occasion was forced to keep io in a small cage for a whole week,
and when all the birds were moved out into a flight they were in perfect
condition. They are not vociferous in a crowd unlike the Short-toed
Larks which tend to chatter away like Budgerigars. The one that I kept
overwinter went into a very hard moult in October, leaving itself with
only one crest feather, and so bereft of primaries that flight w^as
virtually impossible. I wonder whether this happens in the wild.
I managed to get a few of these birds over to my friend Herbert
Murray and I can remember a steady correspondence over the distinc-
tion between the Crested and Thekla Lark Galerida theklae. I
remember Mr. Murray saying that his birds perch a great deal in the
aviary, much more than he had expected. It was this characteristic that
had prompted him to suspect that they were Theklas. I have never seen
a Crested Lark perch in my collection, but have seen them perched on
walls and even telephone cables in the wild. The largest cage they have
been kept in is a 7 ft flight. At night they roost in a corner, fluffing up
like quail. They sometimes do this in the daytime.
In November 1971 I made the following entry in my journal : " One
dealer in the rastro had two cages full of birds. Presumably he had a
different hunting ground from the others as he had several Woodlarks,
Tree Sparrows, a Rock Bunting, plus the usual set of Goldfinches and
Linnets. I bought two Woodlarks Lullula arborea, selecting a dark bird
with near-black streaks, and a paler bird with much browner streaks.
They are beautiful birds, in superb condition. The paler of the two is

much bolder and far less nervous of my presence. While I was tidying
up the bird room it made the well-known Woodlark call several times.
" Food offered was mealworm beetles, small mealworms, millipedes,
a grasshopper--all of which were eaten quickly. A bowl of soaked
sponge cake sprinkled with Sluis Universal food seemed to be ignored,
but the chopped-up mealworms with which this dish had been gar-
nished were neatly picked out. They roosted on the ground, fluffed out
and clumping, looking for all the world like a pair of broody bantams."
A month later the following postcript was added, ". . . have settled in
very well now. Are taking " universal " type softbill food plus just a
few mealworms a day." I took these birds along to illustrate part of a
lecture that I was giving to the Madrid Bird Society and one rather
crusty retired Army padre commented that the Woodlarks back in
Devon were bigger. He may well have been right; they turned out to
be two females.

By G. B. Frith (Walton-on-Thames, Surrey)
I was recently told by Dr. C. J. O. Harrison that a number of live
Wilson's Birds of Paradise were in several English collections. As a
result of this a one day trip was made to Birdland, Bourton-on-the-
Water and three days were spent at Chester Zoo. This prompt
action was stimulated by the lack of knowledge of the species with
regard to nearly all aspects of its biology. Wilson's is closely related
to the better known Magnificent Bird of Paradise D. magnifica the
displays of which have been graphically described by Rand (1940)
and several others. Wilson's is confined to the hilly interior of Waigeo
and Batanta, the largest of the Western Papuan Islands, where it is
thought to have evolved and diverged considerably from an ancestral
Magnificent bird type.
In general the feathering is not unlike that of the male Magnificent
but Wilson's differs markedly in having a bright blue bald head criss-
crossed with fine lines of short black feathers. The female is very
similar to that of the Magnificent but it also has a bald blue head

c. b. frith--Wilson's bird of paradise
(duller than male) with lines of black feathering. If the head colour
and pattern of the male is purely for courtship display it is curious
that the female's head should be so similar. Nothing is known of the
reproductive activities of this species so there is scope for major con-
tributions to our knowledge to be gained from captive birds. That is
not to say that I am in favour of wholesale importation of birds into
this, or any other, country (see Frith (1974)).
A full day was spent at Bourton-on-the-Water and approximately
four hours of observation were made on the lone male Wilson's there
at that time. Unfortunately this individual was extremely inactive and
had started to moult a little about the nape. It was housed with a
number of Diamond Doves which at times appeared to disturb it. I
believe the lack of activity by this bird was probably due to the high
temperature of the aviary and the start of the moult.
My time at Chester Zoo was more rewarding but, again, I think
the male there was about to start moulting. Long periods of observation
were made on a pair at Chester during October I2th-i4th, 1973,
during which notes, sketches and tape recordings were made. Both
birds were in splendid condition and were housed in, what I consider,
a near ideal aviary for them--a large planted outside flight (c. 15 x 9 x
9 feet) with access to a (at one time) planted sheltered area (9x9x9
feet). The latter area was slightly heated, just preventing it from
dropping below freezing and lighting was natural. At the time of
observation the male had defoliated all plants in the inside shelter
and had done the same to all manageable plants in the outside flight.
This leaf plucking was performed in the course of court clearance
activity. A fairly large privet hedge in the outside flight was entirely
stripped of leaves. A point can be stressed here : by virtue of the
fact that this male plucked foliage one can fairly safely assume, taking
our knowledge of other such " court clearing " birds of paradise,
manakins, etc. into account, that there is a definite motivation or
" need " to do so. If one wants to breed such species it is almost
certainly advantageous to provide a suitably foliaged area in order
to allow the male to go through a natural progression of courtship
behavioral patterns.
It should be remembered that birds of paradise are mostly birds
of medium or high altitude where relative temperatures change con-
siderably in a day. During several hours of very cold heavy rain the
Chester pair were seen to spend the whole period actively engaged
in the outside flight.
Display
A few, apparently low intensity, displays of the Wilson's Bird of
Paradise were described by Winterbottom (1928) but the postures
described below appear to be new records for the species. As was
expected the displays seen were very similar to those described for

the Magnificent by Rand.
When perched quietly on a horizontal perch in the presence of the
female the male continuously held the bill pointing at or slightly
above 45 0 with the head tucked well into the shoulders and the yellow
cape raised. Now and then the breast shield was " pulsed " and the
cape and back feathering further erected (Fig. 1) refraction of light
causing both areas to change from dark to brilliant iridescent colora-
tion. This " pulsing " developed into a very low intensity display if
the male was particularly attentive of the female.
It is from a vertical sapling that high intensity display in the wild
is given by the Magnificent and there is very little doubt that Wilson's
does likewise, as similar displays described for the former were ob-
served in this situation. The male would alight on a vertical sapling
or bamboo stem between one and two feet from the ground and perch
with the cape slightiy erected, looking up the stem. Should the female
be about, he might raise the cape further and partly raise and expand
the breast shield, holding the bill close to, and parallel with, the perch
(Fig. 2). On six occasions a more intense display was observed, usually
with the female perched somewhere above, if not actually on the

vertical stem. On these occasions the golden cape feathers were raised
at right angles to the body, the red back area with black bordering
was raised considerably and the breast shield extended to the full
(more so than in Fig. i). This latter display closely resembles one
described by Rand for the Magnificent but the bill was rigidly orien-
tated directly up the perch and close to it, which is not recorded for
the Magnificent. Mr. W. Timmis tells me that he has seen this male
give this display whilst moving up the vertical stem until almost
touching the female perched above and then turn and maintain the
same posture whilst moving down the stem. As in the Magnificent the
tail wires were held out from the stem at 90* from the body. On
occasions he also saw the male carry out this display with a leaf held
in the bill.
I did not see the horizontal high intensity type of display given,
such as Rand described and illustrated for the Magnificent, but Mr.
Timmis has seen such a posture frequently, given after the upright
one (Fig. 2).
Gaping was observed several times, usually when the male was on
a vertical stem. The bill was opened wide exposing the bright yellow-
green mouth. This colourful area is no doubt used in some form of
display.

Feeding

The birds were observed feeding on various fruits, insectile foods
and insects. Both birds were seen to regurgitate various matter,
sometimes re-swallowing it, sometimes letting it drop from the bill tip.
In the latter instances the matter probably consisted of fruit seeds,
skins and insect skeletons. The birds were seen to swallow large pieces
of fruit whole, throwing them from the top of the bill into the back
of the gape and using the tongue to force them backwards and down.
Large grasshoppers were taken in the bill to a convenient perch,
transferred to beneath one or both feet, and their antennae, legs
and other hard parts removed and dropped. It was noted that when-
ever the male was feeding on larger items of food the cape was
gathered together centrally and the breast shield raised either side
and pressed backwards, thus protecting the plumage (Fig. 3). As in
other birds of paradise the birds perfonned extensive bill wiping
and preening after feeding. Such plumage protection and care is
obviously critical in males with ornate and intricate plumage.

A sharp explosive single squawk keeetch was often given from a
horizontal perch and would be of less than a second in duration.
This call was audible up to approximately fifty yards from the bird.
More common was a pleasant soft high-pitched whistle, teel, repeated
five or six times. A stronger and louder call similar to the last was
given from a vertical perch, too - too - too - too - too - too - wit, the
last note of which was sharply raised in pitch resulting in a whip-
crack-like finish. Finally a much louder and penetrating form of

thrust upward with each note. This call was audible at considerable
distances from the bird and in the wild it is probably used in advertise-
ment of the male's presence on his courting ground. The female was
not heard to produce any call.
General notes
Birds in flight produced a soft rustling noise from the flight
feathering typical of birds of paradise, but less harsh than produced
by most other species familiar to me. No male postures seen by myself,
or described by Mr. Timmis presented the blue bare head skin to the
female in any way conspicuously different than those postures used
by the Magnificent when displaying to a hen. It would appear, there-
fore, that this brightly coloured area of naked skin may not have
developed purely for display purposes which would bring about a
display differing markedly from that of the Magnificent. It must
be remembered that both sexes have a naked crown, that of the
female being duller than the males. Perhaps selection by the female
has brought about brighter pigmentation in the male simply by virtue
of it being an additional colourful area; but no associated postures
have developed. But why a bare head in both sexes of the species
population? Gilliard (1969) thought that the bare head of Wilson's
might have evolved as an isolating mechanism on Batanta where the
fairly similar (particularly female) King Bird of Paradise Cicinnurus
regius also occurs.
I am grateful to Mr. W. Timmis for his kind hospitality and
assistance at Chester.

NOTES ON THE PUFF-LEGGED HUMMINGBIRDS
Eriocnemis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998706048780488" page_id="56470992"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire)
Of the ten species which form this genus, only three appear to be
brought into Britain in any numbers, and even these cannot be classed
as regular imports. All the Eriocnemis are extremely difficult to
establish and cannot therefore be recommended to any but the more
experienced hummingbird enthusiasts.
I would advise anyone purchasing an Eriocnemis species to cage the
bird for at least three to four weeks, after which, if the bird is in good
health, it could be released into a flight or aviary with other humming-
birds. The Glowing Puffleg E. vestitus is approximately 4 inches over-
all length; both sexes have extremely large and showy leg-puffs, which
are white. The male is shining dark green above turning to glittering
green on the rump and upper tail-coverts. Throat patch is glittering
purple surrounded by shining green; lower breast and belly is glittering
emerald green and the under tail-coverts are glittering purple. The tail,
which is forked, is dark steel blue.
Females have upperparts shining golden-green, glittering on the
rump. Throat patch and under tail-coverts are glittering blue; sides of
neck and breast buff interspersed with green, remainder of underparts
whitish interspersed with glittering golden-green.
Of the three species which are imported, the Glowing appears to be
the most difficult to establish, and as far as I can ascertain, no avicul-
turist has successfully moulted this species. In England both R. J. Elgar
(Manchester) and I have kept a specimen alive for six months. Elgar's
bird was a female, mine a male. I heard of a Glowing (sex unknown)
surviving for eight months in a collection on the Continent, but have
been unable to acquire details.
The majority of Glowing Pufflegs which enter Britain are dead
within a matter of days, a large percentage dying from enteritis due to
their inability to accept a captive diet.
In 1970, Don Bleitz (California) had a paper published relating how
he had successfully established certain species of hummingbirds con-
sidered to be difficult, by adding plant pollen to their diet. M. W.
Clifford (West Bromwich) and I purchased a small amount of this
pollen from Bleitz and when the next consignment arrived containing
Eriocnemis species, Clifford very kindly gave me a vestitus and a
iuciani; both were males. The vestitus was unable to fly more than a
few feet at a time, due to the three outer primaries of one wing being
broken off near the base. Because of this, the bird had to be housed
permanently in a cage. However, the bird was able to move about
surprisingly well and managed to reach its nectar and take a bath

whenever it wished; also it was seen to take fruit flies, albeit rather
awkwardly.
This bird died while I was away on holiday and as I returned home
the day after its death, I was able to inspect the body while it was still
fresh. I could find no reason for the bird's sudden demise; it was well
fleshed and appeared to be free from disease. I have a feeling the bird
died because of its inability to fly correctly. Hummingbirds rely on their
powers of flight more so than most species and if for some reason they
are unable to fly correctly, many of them appear to lose the will to
live. Since losing the Glowing, I have had one other, a male. This bird
did not have the vitality of my first bird and within ten days had died
from enteritis.
I believe that plant pollen could be of help when attempting to
establish such a difficult species as the Glowing Puffleg, however, the
bird would have to be reasonably healthy at the time of purchase;
otherwise there is little hope of success.
Unfortunately, plant pollen granules cannot at the time of writing,
be purchased direct in Britain and I have to obtain my supply from a
firm in France. For anyone wishing to add plant pollen to their birds'
diet, the following instructions should be adhered to. Into a small clean
jar, preferably with an airtight lid, place one (5ml.) teaspoonful of
pollen granules and two teaspoonfuls of cane sugar; add approximately
four ounces of warm water, place the lid on the jar and shake
thoroughly until the pollen and the sugar are dissolved.
The mixture should be made up last thing at night for the morning
feed and at lunchtime for the evening feed. It should be left at room
temperature, and not placed in a refrigerator.
I would like to point out that the plant pollen referred to is the
natural one sold in granule form. Pollenflor (and other such products)
which can be purchased from most health stores in Britain, have under
analysis been proven to be of no benefit to birds.
The Coppery-bellied Puffleg E. cupreoventris is approximately gf
inches overall length. Upperparts are shining golden green; throat and
breast glittering emerald green, turning to glittering coppery green on
the belly. Under tail-coverts are glittering purple and the forked tail
is blue-black; leg-puffs white. Sexes are similar.
This species had just begun to appear in consignments reaching
Britain when the South American countries started to restrict the
exportation of birds. As with the remainder of the genus, cupreoventris
has proved difficult to establish.
The late Guy Detry (Wavre, Belgium), had a Goppery-bellied for
almost three months and Karl-L. Schuchmann (Weiterstadt, West
Germany), had a specimen which he imported himself, for approxi-

It appears the habits of the Coppery-bellied are very much like those

of the other puff-legged species. The birds owned by Detry and
Schuchmann were extremely fond of bathing; also they were seen to
spend much of their time resting on one foot. The Coppery-bellied can
be rather belligerent, but as with the Sapphire-vented, much of this
appears to be bluff.
The Sapphire-vented Puffleg, E. luciani, is approximately 5^ inches
overall length. Upperparts are shining coppery green; underparts
glittering emerald green. Under tail-coverts glittering purple and the
forecrown shining blue. The long deeply forked tail is black; downy
leg-puffs white. Sexes are similar.
The Sapphire-vented is brought in less frequently than the Glowing.
It is a most attractive species and were it an easy bird to establish,
would without doubt be a great favourite among hummingbird
enthusiasts.
I purchased a male soon after becoming interested in hummingbirds.
At the time I was unaware how difficult the Eriocnemis can be, and was
most upset when the bird died after being with me for only a matter
of days.
Since then I have successfully established a male which was given to
me by M. W. Clifford on the 16th April, 1971. This bird was caged
for the first three weeks, after which it was released into my communal
hummingbird flight where it remained until its death 2^ years later;
surely a longevity record for this species.
As with all the Eriocnemis , the Sapphire-vented was extremely fond
of bathing; also it drank a certain amount of water each day. It is
therefore essential for the well-being of these birds, that clean water
is available at all times.
The Sapphire-vented can prove to be extremely aggressive towards
other hummingbirds and anyone fortunate enough to establish one,
should be wary when introducing it into a communal flight. Most of
the aggression shown by this species is bluff and should another
hummingbird have nerve enough to stand up to the puffleg, it will
usually be left alone. However, a bird which shows fear, is usually
harassed unmercifully.
The dividing line between mating display and aggression in certain
species of hummingbirds is very thin indeed. In fact there is a possi-
bility that many mating displays begin as aggression, turning to actual
mating display only when a submissive female is found. As can be
expected, the white thigh feathering is much in evidence during the
display of puff-legged species. The Sapphire-vented would hover in
an upright position with the legs held out away from the body, thus
displaying the leg-puffs to advantage. While remaining in this position,
the puffleg would then fly toward the bird at which the display was
being directed, stopping only a matter of inches away. If this was not
enough to persuade the bird into leaving the perch, the puffleg would

fly backwards, still remaining in an upright position, and then fly
toward the perching bird once more. The forward movement is
extremely rapid and it always surprised me that the puffleg was able to
stop so abruptly. The backward movement was more leisurely and an
observer is able to see this particular action most clearly. If the bird at
which the display was being directed became unnerved and left its
perch, the puffleg would give chase. Should the bird which was being
chased, turn on the puffleg at this stage, the latter would appear to go
berserk and would repeat the movements already described, again and
again until the unfortunate " victim 55 was forced almost to the ground.
Occasionally a very timid hummingbird would take refuge in a plant;
should this occur, the Sapphire-vented would direct its display toward
the plant in an attempt to drive the bird out. It is somewhat difficult to
describe in words just how remarkable is the display of the Sapphire-
vented Puffleg. As I have witnessed it many times, it has obviously lost
some of its appeal; however, someone seeing it for the first time, could
not help being fascinated.
None of the Eriocnemis appear to have a song, and other than a
weak alarm call {twit, twit , twit), these birds are silent. The Sapphire-
vented makes a cracking sound prior to the forward thrust during its
display, but I presume this is made by the wings.
I feel certain the problems encountered with many of the humming-
bird species considered to be difficult, are dietary ones. After having
success with the Sapphire-vented and partial success with the Glowing,
I had begun to hope that the addition of plant pollen to the diet would
prove to be the answer to all our problems. However, much as I believe
pollen to be beneficial to hummingbirds, it is most certainly not the
complete answer. It is essential therefore, if more is to be learnt
regarding these birds, that anyone fortunate enough to have even a small
amount of success with a known difficult species, makes known his or
her findings. The question is not why do such birds die soon after
capture, but why do the occasional ones survive long enough to become
established.

(Stellenbosch, South Africa)
As far as we can determine from literature such as Rutgers and
Norris (1972) the Purple-crested Touraco or Lourie has not previously
been bred in captivity. One pair at the Andries Venter Research
Station, Stellenbosch, South Africa, has reared two chicks in each of
two successive seasons and we outline the precise conditions under
which the birds were kept.

Aviary Construction and Contents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98463534375" page_id="56470998"  page_num="217" year="" vol="">
The aviary measured 3 x 3 x 8.5m. long and was constructed of
green coloured mesh with one quarter of the aviary completely closed
in with asbestos sheets on sides and roof. A cut pine tree was fixed
upright in the enclosed section to serve as a nesting place and a wire
mesh platform, 90cm. in diameter, was placed in it one metre from the
earth floor. This platform was covered with pine needles which the
birds later re-arranged.
The aviary was provided with running water and a covered feeding
platform two metres from the ground. Fresh food was prepared each
day and placed on the platform each morning and afternoon to ensure
that food was available continually. This is important since the birds
seem to prefer to feed every half to three-quarter hour. Each morning
any food remaining from the previous day was removed. The aviary
also contained a Mulberry tree that bore fruit during the birds' breed-
ing season. We allowed weeds and grass to grow on the earth floor.
Food
The diet consisted of apples, guavas, paw-paw, tomatoes, grapes,
plums, peaches, sweet melon, green peas and other fruits when in
season. These were cut into small pieces and mixed with a commercially
produced protein rich preparation in the ratio of ten parts by weight
of fruit to one part of the preparation. Each 100 g. of this product
contained: protein 22.0, fat 11.5, carbohydrate 56.2, fibre 1.4, min-
erals 4.5, calcium 0.46, phosphorus 0.48 g., iron 5.5 mg., vit. A
3500 I.U., thiamin 1.06, riboflavin 1.5, niacin 14.0, vit. C 53.0 mg. The
calorific value is 4.13K cal.
Every three or four days a few drops of multi-vitamin oil were
added but this was not essential and we only did so for one of the two
breeding seasons. When necessary, depending on the moisture content
of the fruit or on the heat of the day, the food was moistened with
water to ensure that the protein rich flakes were kept wet and adhering
to the fruit. From August the food was supplemented with approxi-
mately 15 g. of minced horse meat per bird per day. The eggs were

laid at the end of September in 1972 and in mid-October in the follow-
ing year, our spring, of course.
The need for addition of extra protein to the fruit diet was well
demonstrated when the birds had chicks. They were seen to actively
search in corners and under leaves for worms and insects.

Breeding Activity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953482051282" page_id="56470999"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
In each season the birds laid a clutch of three eggs at intervals of
slightly more than one day. The incubation period to pipping and to
full hatching was measured for each egg of the clutch but the
standard measurement is for the last laid egg. In the first season it took
20 days 7.0 hrs. (+/-38.0 hrs.) to pipping and the interval before the
chick was fully out of the shell was 22 days 22.5 hrs. (+/-5.0 hrs.). In
the second season the interval to pipping was 21 days 20.0 hrs. (+/-49.0
hrs.) and the interval to hatching was 22 days 8.5 hrs. (+/-15.5 hrs.). Thus
pipping took place on the 21st or 22 nd day and full hatching on the
23rd day. In the first season the third laid egg failed to hatch and so
the incubation period recorded for the second season is more accurate.
The birds did not incubate fully until the whole clutch was laid :
both sexes took turns and covered the eggs continuously. It was
common to see both parents together on the nest and sometimes one
was incubating one egg and the other parent the other two eggs. When
the eggs hatched the parents ate the shells. An extract from an actual
observation reads. "At 16.30 hrs. both parents were on the nest. One
was brooding the chick that had hatched earlier and the other was
sitting on its back. The third egg and second (which was hatching)
were exposed. The bird brooding the first chick appeared to be helping
the second chick out of the two halves of the shell which were still
joined at one small point. The second parent watched and then climbed
off the mate's back onto the side opposite to where the chick and egg
were lying. As soon as the hatching chick was clear of the eggshell, the
brooding parent began eating the shell, whereupon the other parent
leant over and pulled off about half the shell and ate it. This parent
now climbed over its mate and proceeded to brood the newly hatched
chick and the remaining egg."
The newly hatched chicks had their eyes fully open and had active
nictitating membranes. They possessed fairly thick, grey-brown down.
The skin was mainly pink and the eye dark and surrounded by bluish-
grey skin. The bill was pale pink at the base but otherwise dark.
The first pin feathers started to appear on wings and tail at 7 or 8
days. The 1 o-day-old chick had feathers appearing in many places and
the primary and secondary wing feathers were emerging from their
sheaths. The 22-day-old chick had an advanced state of feather
development and at about this age the chicks became very active.
They dashed about the nest platform and in the nest tree. The first
trace of red pigmentation on the wings was seen when 22 or 23 days

old on the first four primary feathers (counted from the inside towards
the wing tip). By the 38th day the red was still extending in area and
was present on primaries 1 to 9.
The first true flight was witnessed when chicks were 38 days old in
the 1972 season. In the next season chicks were climbing about the nest
tree when 25 days old and on the 29th day one was in a neighbouring
tree and had probably flown there.
Once the chicks hatched they were brooded almost continuously for
the first week, after which brooding was progressively less continuous.
Chicks were fed by regurgitation and often swallowed large lumps of
undigested fruit. Generally once a chick had been fed it erected its tail
and presented the anus upwards. The parent then often touched the
anal area with its beak and this seemed to stimulate defecation. The
large soft faeces were swallowed by the parent and apparently digested
since the parent did not regurgitate them on leaving the nest.
In the first season only two of the three eggs hatched and both chicks
were reared to maturity. In the second season all three eggs hatched but
one chick died before maturity. One chick from each year is still alive
and well. One of the other two probably died from accidental food
poisoning when some bad meat was fed to it and the other died for
reasons unknown. The parents are still well and indications are that
this is quite a long-lived species since our pair have been in our aviary
for eight years.

Barbara and Michael Glover have a fine comprehensive collection
of birds housed in the spacious garden of their home beside the Indian
Ocean at Malindi, Kenya. Malindi is north of the port of Mombasa
and has lately become an extremely popular resort with tourists. Dur-
ing 1971 they decided to open the collection to visitors and called it--
Birdland, Malindi. I stayed with them for four days earlier this year
and while there I never succeeded in counting all the many birds they
have, but did list just over two hundred species living in more than
sixty aviaries and pens.
The first birds that visitors to the garden see are the hornbills and
owls. There is a good selection of East African hornbills---a Southern
Ground, two Black and White-casqued, two Trumpeter and several
Crowned, as well as Red-billed, Jackson's and a single Von der
Decken's.

Owls are also well represented, with pride of place being taken by a
young Verreaux's Eagle Owl. This is the species that is also known as
the Milky Eagle Owl and now, occasionally, as the Giant. There are a
pair of Spotted Eagle Owls and a single specimen of the race Bubo
africanus cinerascens which differs from the former principally in
having dark, instead of yellow, eyes. An obvious distinction between
the living birds which is not mentioned by Mackworth-Praed and
Grant (1957). This particular bird was hit by a car and had a damaged
wing: the accident happened near the Galana River, Kenya which is
south of the range for it given by Mackworth-Praed and Grant who
do not record this race for Kenya, and this is in fact the second record.
A pair of Savigny's bred at London Zoo during 1973 and presented by
them is another eagle owl that is exhibited.
Other East African species are the African Wood and Barn Owls,
White-faced and African Scops Owls, and from elsewhere Tawny and
Little Owls. A pair of Collared Scops Owls Otus hakkamoena are to
be added.
Birds of prey which in the wild occur in great profusion in East
Africa are not too well represented. Of the bigger species there are two
pairs of African Fish Eagles, a Bateleur, and a magnificent Steppe
Eagle. When the noted East African ornithologist John G. Williams
visited Malindi recently in the company of Eric Hosking, he said, he
considered the Steppe Eagle to be the most handsome specimen in the
collection. It was certainly a healthy and alert looking bird, yet was
caught near Voi by a person walking up to it and throwing something
over it. The Steppe Eagle is a winter visitor to Africa, of course, and it
may have arrived in an exhausted condition. Among the other species
are a Long-crested Eagle, a young Wahlberg's, two Lizard Buzzards and
a Black-shouldered Kite.
Several of the aviaries have shrubs and other vegetation growing
in them and house varied assortments of softbills, doves and pigeons,
some weavers and other seed-eaters. There are Golden-breasted, Blue-
eared Glossy, Black-breasted Glossy Lamprotornis corruscus, Splendid
Glossy, Superb, Hildebrandt's, Bristle-crowned Onychognathus salva-
dorii, and Violet-backed Starlings; also the related Red-billed Ox-
pecker. On the first occasion I visited Malindi during an August there
were Violet-backed Starlings feeding among the bushes along the drive
leading to the garden.
Sadly at present there are only single examples of the White-cheeked,
White-crested Tauraco leucolophus , Hartlaub's and Fischer's Turacos
T. fisc hen. This was the first occasion I have seen the last named
species which was the subject of a very good picture painted by Rena
Fennessy and reproduced as a greetings card a few years back. Hope-
fully a mate for the White-crested will soon be obtained from Mrs.
Avril Roys ton of Nakuru, Kenya who, I have been told, may have

bred as many as six of this species, and Ross's Turaco as well. She has
also, I believe, bred the Joyful Greenbul Chlorocichla laetissima, but
so far I have been unable to confirm all of these breeding successes.
Most of the commoner African seed-eaters are on show, together
with less common species such as the Red-headed Blue-bill Spermo-
phaga ruficapilla , Purple Grenadier and Black-crowned Waxbills.
There are lots of Golden Palm Weavers Ploceus bojeri, and others not
very well known in avicultural circles like Fire-fronted Bishops
Euplectes diademata, Black-necked P. nigricollis, Black-billed P.
melanogaster and Chestnut Weavers P. rubiginosus. It was notable
that the red areas of the plumage of many species, particularly the
male Red-collared Widow Birds, had faded to a remarkable degree.
This also seemed to have happened with a pair of Double-toothed
Barbets, which is something I have not noticed with this species before.
Outstanding among the exhibits is an aviary called a " Walk in "
where visitors can go in among the birds. Not so much because of the
concept, for this is now far from new, but because of what lives in the
aviary. This includes no less than ten Carmine Bee-eaters Merops n.
nubicus, a White-throated Bee-eater M. albicollis, a wonderfully tame
pair of Ross's Turacos, a Golden-breasted Starling and two species I
have never seen anywhere before, namely the Violet-breasted Sunbird
Nectarinia pembae chalcomelas and Mangrove Kingfisher Halcyon
senegaloides.
The bee-eaters and, in fact all the other birds, are very steady and so
long as visitors do not stray from the path seem quite unconcerned by
their presence. When photographing the bee-eaters I found they would
allow me to approach to within a few inches of them. The most difficult
part was trying to operate with two inquisitive turacos climbing about
me, for they perched on my head and shoulders, and more than once
settled on the camera.
A most interesting part for me was to watch the bee-eaters feed, for
they thrive on a mixture of raw minced meat and chopped hard-boiled
egg, and a local brand of sweet biscuit soaked in fat and broken up.
They also get grasshoppers once a day, and if these are held above the
head they will snatch them in flight. There are some original birds
from before the collection was opened which first learnt to accept this
artificial diet, and as others have been added these have learnt to accept
it by watching the original birds.
They took an obvious delight both in sun-bathing and bathing in
rain water which got in through the roof covering. One Carmine,
though, I watched bathe in the pond below a waterfall which it did
like a kingfisher by plunging into the water. It did this several times,
returning to a perch between each soaking to shake its plumage and
preen a little. Before this, however, the first thing it did after landing
on a branch from the water was to bang its bill against the perch, as in

killing an insect, thus shaking excess water from the bill and head.
A smaller bird than the Carmine, the White-throated is mainly pale
green with black and white on the head and throat, and has two
extremely long and thin central tail feathers. Despite being smaller i
though, this bird was not averse to driving any of the Carmine from a j
spot on a perch if wanted for itself. It seemed to be a more excitable
bird, for it frequently called and did a lot of showing-off, holding the j
wings open to show a dark lower edge.
The male Violet-breasted Sunbird is not particularly brightly
coloured as sunbirds go, being generally dark metallic green with a
violet-purple band across the chest and a black belly. I am ashamed to
admit that until it was pointed out to me I carelessly assumed the
Mangrove Kingfisher to be an example of the commoner Woodland
species. They are almost identical, except that the Mangrove King-
fisher has the lower mandible red like the upper mandible, and not
black. Also, although I did not notice it at the time, the feet should
have been red, not black like those of the Woodland Kingfisher. A pair
of Grey-headed Kingfishers also live in this aviary.
Other species living in it include several Allen's Gallinules and Black
Crakes, more Superb and Splendid Glossy Starlings, African Pied Wag-
tails, Joyful Greenbuls and single examples of the Broad-billed Roller
and Red-headed Weaver. Elsewhere in the garden there are more
Allen's Gallinules and Black Crakes; also Purple Gallinules and the
African Crake Crex egregia, a Lesser Moorhen and some African
Jacanas.
An enclosure with some trees and a large pond houses an Ostrich,
Wood Ibises or Yellow-billed Storks, a Black-headed Heron, Sacred
Ibises, Egyptian Geese, grey-necked Crowned Cranes and lots of
guineafowl. Among these birds I was surprised to see an Openbill Stork
Anastomus lamelligerus. Michael told me it is no trouble now, although
when it first arrived it had to be force-fed. A Sarus Crane, Carolina
Duck and some Common Peafowl also share this enclosure.
Of course not all the birds are local species; the Glovers make
regular trips to Europe where they visit zoos, bird gardens, and dealers,
and never return home without some additions for the collection.
Among those they returned with last year were pairs of Victoria
Crowned Pigeons, Sulphur-breasted Toucans and Black-winged Lories,
together with a White-winged Trumpeter. At first the latter was
allowed to roam free, but after being kicked by a child it became
aggressive towards them, so unfortunately now has to be penned when
visitors are about.
Blue and Yellow, Red and Yellow, and Green-winged Macaws are
shown and soon it is hoped to add a Military Macaw. There are a few
Amazon parrots, cockatoos, and Australian parrakeets and finches; also
a pair of Swinhoe's Pheasants.

Gockatiels and Diamond Doves regularly breed, but unfortunately
few other species at present, although Red and Yellow Barbets have
done so in the past. When I was there Superb Starlings and White-
headed Buffalo Weavers had nests, while the Black-winged Lories were
showing signs of nesting. Since returning to England I have learnt that
these are now sitting on two eggs and Allen's Gallinules have bred in
the H Walk in Earlier in the year a pair of White-crested Jay
Thrushes nested and produced a youngster, but ate it; then one of the
pair was killed by a predator.
Predators are one of the most difficult problems; not only are there
the usual domestic varieties, but hawks and snakes, and worst of all
genets which will attack small birds through the wire at night and bite
their legs off. This means most birds have to be shut into shelters at
night, something which is not conducive to good breeding results.
Shelter has to be provided not only from the sun, but seasonal
tropical rainstorms, for many birds are incredibly stupid about rain
and will sit out exposed to the full force of it, and eventually become
completely waterlogged. The roof of the " Walk in " is entirely covered
over during the rainy seasons because the bee-eaters are prime
offenders.
To any members planning a holiday in Kenya I would certainly
recommend a visit to Malindi to see this bird garden. Close by are
Mida Greek which is one of the few places on the Kenya coast where
Grab Plovers Dromas ardeola may be seen, and the Sokoke-Arabuku

see the Yellow-rumped Elephant Shrew Rhynchocyon chrysopygus.

By Kerry A. Muller (Curator of Birds)
The breeding season at die Zoo for the past year was plagued by
several problems. Extensive strikes by electrical workers in Sydney
resulted in the loss of several hundred eggs in the incubators due to
chilling. These included most of the eggs from the ratites, pheasants,
quail, waterfowl and plovers. Additionally, severe wet and cold weather
in the spring nesting season, as well as our reconstruction and land-
scaping programme in the breeding aviaries, severely restricted most
of the parrot reproduction. Despite these problems, the overall breeding
results showed improvement over last year; 59 species were reared to
independence, a total of 312 individuals. Last year 54 species of 254
individuals were reared. The following are some of the more note-
worthy birds raised :

The total number of species and individuals represented in the
collection was deliberately reduced--particularly of common species.
Particular effort was made to represent a wider diversity of families
and to study the management and husbandry of little-known species.
Several new birds were added to the collection during the year.
Particularly noteworthy are the following :

Many of the Zoo's older 140 exhibit aviaries were landscaped to
simulate the habitats of the birds exhibited, e.g. desert, swamp, heath,
shore, etc and this greatly improves the exhibit from both the visitor's
and the bird's point of view.
Aluminium photo-sensitive signs have been completed and installed
for all the species in the collection. These state nomenclature, diet,
habitat, nest site and construction, and include a range map. In mixed
exhibits painted illustrations have been prepared for each species to
complement the aluminium label.
Viewed overall, it has been a year of satisfactory progress, with good
prospects for continued improvement.

Most of the passengers on my plane from Singapore to Perth accepted with
stoical resignation the pilot's mid-flight announcement that we would not land
at Perth but would proceed straight to Sydney. It was my first intimation that
a strike of oil-distribution workers was going to alter my plans and the plans
of the majority of the participants of the Congress in Canberra. Those people
on pre-congress tours were often stranded; those who had just arrived in
Australia could proceed no further than Sydney. However with super-human
effort the hard-pressed organisers of the Congress solved most of the travel
problems and by the evening of the advertised first day at least six hundred
people managed to reach Canberra and attend the postponed opening. Only
one day of the Congress was lost, but this did mean a further telescoping of an
already crowded programme. Some 200 papers to be delivered in 4 days!
Grouped into 11 specialist symposia and 24 general sessions, with as many as 5
sessions running simultaneously, the range of subjects covered, and often the
distance between lecture rooms, was extensive. Inevitably there were clashes
when 2 or more papers of personal interest were being given at the same time
in different parts of the campus. The titles of the symposia alone give some
idea of the diversity of papers available:--- Origins of Australasian avifauna:
Biology of the southern hemisphere species: The value of various taxonomic
characters in avian classification: Breeding birds in southern continents: Biology
of crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia) in two hemispheres: Structure of feathers:
Physiological and behavioural adaptations to arid zones: Systematics of
Australian passerine birds: Evolution of island land birds: Co-operative breeding
in birds: Seabirds --\0x25A0 distribution, speciation and ecological diversification at sea.
The organisers, determined that no one should be either bored or lonely,
arranged a variety of ornithological films for evening entertainment and a
number of excellent exhibits within the campus and the city. There was a
philatelic display by the Australian Post Office; a display of birds and books
by the National Library; Australasian bird sounds; birds and stamps; birds in
the mythology and life of aboriginal people; a palaeontological display and an
exhibition of wildlife paintings. For those really dedicated and not too exhausted
there were early morning bird-watching walks in the beautifully kept Botanical
Gardens.
Some participants stayed on in Canberra for The World Conference of the
International Council for Bird Preservation. This smaller conference of repre-
sentatives of National sections, International bodies, and observers from various
countries was very much a working conference with an intimate and enlivening

atmosphere. At the close of the conference a number of resolutions was unani-
mously adopted which well reflect the wide range of subjects discussed. They
included resolutions on the dangers facing island wildlife especially from
introduced predators, the need for more rainforest reserves in North-eastern
Australia, the need for minimising or avoiding the enormous mortality of
seabirds associated with salmon gillnets and the dangers of oil pollution to the
nesting seabirds around the southern continents. The organisers of this confer-
ence provided equally welcome diversions from the working sessions.
Participants at one or both conferences must be immensely grateful to the
hard working, enthusiastic and efficient organisers, and for the kindness and
hospitality of our Australian colleagues.

A very successful Wine and Cheese party was held on 21st Oct-
ober, at Burlington House when Derrick England delighted members
with an illustrated talk about birds seen on his recent visit to the
West Indies. The photography was of the superb quality we have
come to expect from this popular speaker and the technical details
given were just as interesting as the birds, particularly the revela-
tion that the lighting equipment used to photograph humming
birds cost a fraction of that normally considered necessary.

Prof. J. R. Hodges writes : "A reference to the remarkable breeding
record of one of my pairs of Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets Neophema
chrysostoma appeared in News and Views of the September-October
1972 number of the Magazine. The pair, consisting of an Australian
aviary bred (1965) cock and a 1966 English bred hen, had produced
56 perfect chicks in six years during each of which they were double-
brooded. In 1972 they reared only half their normal quota of
youngsters and although they went to nest twice, the second attempt
was unsuccessful. I thought that their breeding career might be
coming to an end, but in 1973 they reared five chicks and this year
another six. They continue to show no signs of old age. Blue-winged
are said to be less sought after by aviculturists than the other readily
available species of grass parrakeet. It is difficult to understand their
lack of popularity because they are far more beautiful than the
Elegant, more steady than most Turquoisines and more robust than
the Splendid--in fact they appear to possess all the attributes of a
perfect species for an outdoor aviary. They are quiet, steady, at-
tractive, hardy and long-lived, and they thrive and breed well in a
small enclosure. I have kept the species, with undiminished enjoy-
ment for more than fifteen years.
However, they do appear to be getting scarce and, for example,

In the July-August issue of the Magazine, the hatching of two
Timneh Grey Parrots was reported, with the owner's remarks that
he did not know whether this subspecies had been bred before. We

Busch Gardens, in Tampa, Florida, recently, she learned that this
subspecies had been bred there during the past few months and
that two young had been successfully reared.

At the Council meeting on 21st October, 1974, it was decided that
it was necessary, due to rising costs, either to increase the member-
ship fee or effect some economy. The Council decided that for
the next year the subscription would not be increased, but that the
Magazine would be published four times a year, instead of six.
Each number will definitely have 60 pages, one and a half times
the pages of each bi-monthly issue; thus the actual page numbers
per volume of the Magazine will remain unchanged. The economy
of only four printings and four lots of postage will enable us to
make ends meet and we hope that members will agree that this is
the best method of dealing with the problem.
The membership of the Society has started to rise again, and the
Council, which is now broadly-based and very enthusiastic, hope that
everyone will endeavour to bring in more new members. Another
200 members would enable us to reinstate the six issues and cover
a further increase in costs.

I would like to remind members of the library scheme which
we operate jointly with the Linnean Society, as it seems to me that
not enough are taking advantage of the very considerable benefits
offered for a modest fee, perhaps because they are unaware of the
scheme's existence. This seems to apply particularly to newer
members and it would be a great pity if the arrangement were to
cease for lack of support.
For #1 per year, Avicultural Society members can purchase a
Reader's Ticket which gives them access to one of the finest
reference libraries in the world, containing many old and rare books
on ornithology and botany as well as the branches of pure and
applied zoology. In addition some 900 journals are available in-
cluding those which this Society receives in exchange for the Avi-
cultural Magazine--approximately 80 publications from all over
die world and of particular interest to aviculturists. The books which
our Society owns are housed together with the Linnean Society's
collection of works on aviculture and ornithology making a total
of some 500 volumes, many of which are general reference books
for identification purposes as well as field guides, checklists, etc.
Reader's Tickets are available from the Avicultural Society's
office and I hope that there will be many more applicants--one or
two visits to this unique library and building would more than
justify the expenditure.

As members of the Club will know, a referendum was held earlier
this year to determine whether, in view of the fact that the Society
now holds three Wine and Cheese parties a year open to all, there
was still need for a dining club and, if so, whether a volunteer
committee could be formed to run it as a separate entity.
Of the 114 B.A.C. members circulated, only eighteen were in
favour of the B.A.C. continuing.
At the last Council meeting, it was decided that in view of this
rather unenthusiastic response and the fact that there would be
some conflict of interests between the Society's own social programme
and anything that could be arranged by the B.A.C., it would be
best to dissolve the Club.
Would B.A.C. members please let me know, by 1st January, 1975,
whether they have any objections to the Club's bank balance, at
present #75.96, being donated to the Avicultural Society's general
fund?

CEREBRAL HAEMORRHAGE IN BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984980258064516" page_id="56471019"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
I was interested to read (avicultural magazine July/August) Dr. C. J. O.
Harrison's observations of cerebral bleeding as a possible cause of death in both
wild and aviary birds. Certainly cerebral haemorrhage can occur in birds as in
any other animal, but the appearances described are, I think, very seldom due
to spontaneous haemorrhage and very commonly indeed due to violence.
In a good many birds picked up dead---I confess I have never actually seen
one fall--if one makes a cut across the back of the scalp, or even in little birds
such as waxbills, breaks the skin with one's thumbnail, and pushes the skin
forward to expose the cranium, then a dark blue-red patch of haemorrhage is
often seen showing through the nearly transparent skull, and is undoubtedly the
cause of death. If, however, the skull is now cut open and the flap covering the
haemorrhage turned forwards like the lid of a box, it will often be seen that the
effusion of blood has penetrated the cellular bone of the skull itself as well as
collecting between skull and brain. Now this cannot happen to a spontaneous
haemorrhage from a burst vessel in the brain due to raised blood pressure or
disease of the arteries. The membranes covering the brain and lining the skull
are quite tough and invariably confine cerebral bleeding to the surface of the
brain itself, and blood in the substance of the cranial bones is proof positive
that the haemorrhage was due to violence from outside.
Further, in a few cases I have seen, a minute dent could be found, sur-
rounded by a darker patch of effused blood, like the bullseye of a target, in the
middle of the darkened patch. This I think must represent the point where the
fatal jab at the base of the brain was given by one of the other inhabitants of
the aviary. No doubt the cause is sometimes " night fright " with collision of
the skull with the roof of the aviary, but I think the short sharp murderous
lunge at the base of the skull, which even the mildest waxbill will sometimes
indulge in, is much the commonest cause.
It is noteworthy that bleeding into the skin of the scalp, which one would
expect, is hardly ever seen, even in cases where the evidence of injury to the
cranium is unequivocal.

The suggestion made by Dr. Harrison (avicultural magazine 1974: 162)
that the " cerebral haemorrhage ", so often found in avian post-mortem material,
may be the consequence of stress and the cause of death is probably mistaken.
In diseases of gage and aviary birds 1969, ed. by Margaret L. Petrak, Lea &amp;
Febinger, Philadelphia, page 293 in the section on the cardiovascular system by
R. N. T-W-Fiennes this subject is discussed. I quote: " When the skin is
removed from the head of dead birds, haemorrhages are often noted between
the compact layers of bone of the calvaria. These are often misinterpreted as
being due to some injury or to a blow on the head, or they might be thought to
be haemorrhages of underlying meninges or cerebral tissue. Such an interpreta-
tion is usually incorrect . . . The haemorrhages into the calvaria are in most cases
agonal and arise from capillary rupture consequent to right heart failure".
I.e. it follows, rather than precedes, death.

REARING THE NORTH AMERICAN RUDDY DUCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98060075" page_id="56471020"  page_num="237" year="" vol="">
I read with interest Mr. Martin's article on the North American Ruddy Duck
in captivity. It is true that many problems will be met with if the rearing is done
in the conventional way--with coop and run, for the ducklings must be put on
to water from the start in a specially constructed pool which must, of course,
have sloping sides and a shelter overall. A 250 watt heat lamp must be suspended
in a corner of the shelter so that the ducklings can go under it for warmth
straight from the water. It is certainly not necessary to give live food and quite
disastrous to provide only shallow pans (4cm.) of water. Our pool is three
metres deep and the young Ruddy Duck are put on to this soon after hatching.
They do perfectly well on a diet of Turkey Starter Crumbs given in a dish
suspended at water level; they can also be reared on duckweed ( Lemna) and
millet. Mr. Oliver Squire pioneered the successful rearing of North American
Ruddy Duck and has secretly reared very many over the years. Another collec-
tion in which large numbers of stifftails are reared is that of Lord Brassey at
Apethorpe and currently he has 44 young in his rearing shed. This year on our
own small pool we reared 14 from one pair and last year raised 18 from the
same pair.
There is no doubt that, with the right equipment and treatment, this species
is among the easiest of ducks to rear and the rearing methods suitable for the
North American could obviously be used for other species of Oxyurini. Slim-
bridge now has a shelter over a pool containing a party of young White-headed
and Maccoa Ducks.

<bodyText confidence="0.999011" page_id="56471020"  page_num="237" year="" vol="">
I am reading with great interest the new series of articles on the Loriinae.
Many problems relating to this subfamily, both ornithological and avicultural
have still to be solved. I am still searching for a satisfactory diet for my lories
and lorikeets; at present I provide them with a 20% solution of sugared water
with a multivitamin compound added, a pinch of mineral salts and raw egg
yolk, one yolk to six litres of the solution; sunflower seed, plenty of green food,
fruit (mostly apple) and crumbled biscuits with, once or twice each week a
pinch of raw minced meat. I must admit that at least 30% of my past and
present pairs, after two or three years of good breeding results, start to let their
young die or kill them when they are a few days old. I do not think that any
disease is involved, for the eggs and chicks can be successfully fostered, but the
hypothesis that over excited males are the culprits cannot be ruled out, though
the problem is a complex one. The fact that at first the chicks are regularly
reared and that only later are they plucked, underfed or killed indicates, in my
opinion, something of a psychological nature. Boredom could be relieved by

colony breeding in large aviaries. I hope to read in the Magazine the experi-
ences of breeders who have had the same troubles--but more especially to hear
from those who have had none. My birds have their nest boxes in the shelters
which are of the open-fronted type.
Curious behaviour on the part of my caiques is worthy of mention. They
make excavations in the gravelled floor of their flight and in doing that the
caique rests its face against the ground and then rapidly casts a rain of gravel
backwards with alternate movements of the legs and the heap of material that
eventually accumulates would fill a wheelbarrow. What the birds are searching
for I do not know, but perhaps it is food such as tuberous roots, sprouting seeds
or insect life.

WORM INFESTATION IN CRANES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996667580645161" page_id="56471021"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
Some readers may recall the paper published in the Magazine Vol. 78 pp.
165-169 in which was described my limited breeding success with the Stanley
Crane Anthropoides paradisea. It was my hopeful intention to breed from the
second generation if things went well. Unfortunately, as most aviculturists well
know, there are more disappointments than successes in breeding programmes.
In May this year one of my home-bred 3rd year male Stanleys went off its
food. It was immediately confined in a small shed under an infra-red lamp and
was coaxed to feed intermittently for four days. At this juncture antibiotics were
administered but at the end of a week the bird succumbed.
A subsequent post-mortem report revealed that there was an infection of
nematodes (round worms). Adults v/ere found in the duodenum and larval
forms in the gizzard. The nematodes were of the Porrocaecum species. I have
been advised that the life history of this species is that the infective larvae are
taken in with the ingestion of earth-worms containing the infective stages. The
earth-worm is digested larvae released and enter the lining of the oesophagus
and gizzard, eventually to become adult.
From the above, it can be concluded that the earth-worm is the host for the
nematodes. Where cranes are kept in open enclosures, earth-worms form a supple-
ment to the diet normally fed and therefore the inherent risk of infestation as
already described must always be present.
On veterinary advice, I am told that Piperazine is the anthelmintic of choice.
The product is a proprietary one and comes in various forms but for practical
use I recommend it in powder form. It is recommended that dosage is carried
out every three months as a routine precaution. Personally, I have been admini-
stering it in cubes of bread cut to the size of a sugar-lump and dusted with the
product. This is readily accepted by the birds.
I trust that the above notes will be of benefit to aviculturists who keep cranes
in their collections and think they would be well advised to take precautionary
action as in my case.
