THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have
not been published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of
a particular bird or group of birds, or that describe their natural history.
Articles should be preferably typewritten, with double spacing, and the
scientific names as well as the vernacular names of birds should be given.
References cited in the text should be listed at the end of the article. Line
drawings, black and white or colour photographs which illustrate a particular
point in the article will be used where possible and should be clearly
captioned. If authors wish their eventual return, they must say so when
submitting the article and write their name on the back of each photograph.
Tables and graphs will also be used wherever possible but authors should be
aware of the constraints of reproduction, particularly regarding the width of
the page which is 105mm.

BREEDING THE RED-CRESTED CARDINAL

<bodyText confidence="0.929794129032258" page_id="56265995"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Paroaria coronata
by Gary Bralsford
I had always fancied keeping and breeding Red-crested Cardinals but
their limited availability and high price (#90 - #250 (approx. US$160-
US$450) a pair) held me back. Then in 2002 a large number were imported
from South America and the price came down to a more affordable level.
I purchased two pairs in September of that year and placed all four birds
in an indoor planted flight 8ft long x 4ft wide x 6ft high (approx. 2.4m long
x 1.2m wide x 1.8m high). I sexed the males by their scarlet red bibs that
went down their throats to a point, their slate grey backs, and their lovely
warbling song.
The pair that nested built a nest high up in a wicker nest pan, that was
fixed to a bracket which was covered with conifer cuttings. The male did
most of the nest building and the nest was completed in about four days.
The first egg was laid about six days later. A total of three eggs were laid.
They were grey-blue with dark blotches at the blunt end. Both the male and
female took turns to incubate them for 14 days.
When the eggs hatched I provided the parents with buffalo worms and
waxworms. Crickets that I put in a bucket were completely ignored. After
nine days two of the chicks were found dead on the floor, but the third chick
was reared to maturity.
The pair went to nest again and as the breeding male had turned aggressive
towards the other male, I removed the latter, leaving the first male with two
females and this time he paired up with the second female. I was able to
identify the two females as I had placed slit rings on their legs. The pair just
added a few pieces of coconut fibre to the first nest. Again there was a
clutch of three eggs and three chicks hatched after 14 days. Two out of the
three chicks were reared.
I was providing about 750 waxworms and 50Gg of buffalo worms per
nest. The two females between them went to nest another five times and
managed to rear a total of nine young. I lost two at the weaning stage, but

remained very pleased with the seven that were reared to maturity. When
they left the nest the young were not very strong flyers and would fall to the
floor when trying to take off from a perch. They would then scramble up
the wire to reach another perch.
They were duller, short stubby-tailed versions of their parents, with the
crest already visible at this early stage. After about four weeks with their
parents they could be separated. The adults were model parents and did a
brilliant job of rearing the young. I think four nests is about right, as young
from further nests are often weaker birds. The male was very aggressive
during the breeding season and would attack the birds in the next flight
through the wire..
At the end of October I separated them for the winter. Although I have
now kept the original birds in indoor flights for almost two years, the red
has not faded and is as bright as that of recently imported birds. They have
access to a good quality British finch seed mixture and softbill food. I also
give them fruit such as apple and pear, plus a few mealworms, and they
have remained in tiptop condition on this diet.
It was an education to watch the male display to and mate with the two
females. At one point I had a female sitting on three eggs and the other
female attempting to build a nest in a seed pan and even laying eggs in this
makeshift nest. During the course of the year both females laid eggs and
reared chicks in the original nest. I witnessed both females with the male
feeding the chicks. By the end of the 2003 breeding season the conifer
cover had died back and the nest basket was in full view, but at no time did
the sitting females come off the eggs or leave the chicks when I was present.
In future I intend to provide a larger nest basket, as I felt the one that was
used was on the small side. I think I could have ended up with a few more
chicks had the basket been larger.

Hombills in Thailand, Avicultural Magazine Vol.109, No.2, pp.57-61,
2003, gave a brief description of the work of the Hornbill Research
Foundation in Thailand and its Hornbill Family Adoption Program, followed
by a report on the 2002 nesting and fledging of a chick by the pair of Bushy-
crested Hombills Anorrhinus galeritus adopted by the society.
Great Hornbill arriving at nest-hole with a lizard.
At the Council Meeting held on Saturday April 5th 2003, the decision
was taken to continue for a further year to support the study of this pair of
hombills and to adopt a second pair of a different species. A pair of
Rhinoceros Hombills Buceros rhinoceros was chosen as the second species.
Later, however, we were advised that it looked unlikely that the pair of
Bushy-crested Hombills was going to nest in 2003, so we instead decided
to adopt a pair of Great Hombills B . bicornis. So, in 2003, the Avicultural
Society adopted a pair of Rhinoceros Hombills and a pair of Great Hombills,
as part of the Hornbill Family Adoption Program.
Dr Pilai Poonswad, Secretary-General of the Hornbill Research
Foundation, has written to thank the society for its support during 2003 and
has provided the following information on the two pairs of hombills adopted
by the Avicultural Society:

MAGPIE RESCUING ITS MATE FROM A CARRION
CROW AND OTHER CROW VERSUS MAGPIE
ENCOUNTERS
by Derek Goodwin
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998957194444445" page_id="56266002"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
The enmity that exists between Magpies Pica pica and Carrion Crows
Corvus corone is well known. In his splendid monograph on the magpies of
the genus Pica, Birkhead (1991) discussed this in some detail and stated,
rightly in my opinion, that this enmity is more harmful to the Magpie than
to the Carrion Crow, which sometimes succeeds in killing Magpies and often
in robbing their nests. Wittenberg&amp;apos;s long-term studies on Carrion Crows in
Germany (Wittenberg, 1988) showed the Magpie was the only species whose
numbers were reduced when Carrion Crows increased in the area.
The apparently great risks that Magpies often take and the nearness with
which they will often approach Carrion Crows on the ground, though never,
in my experience, one that is above them, unless both are in some densely
branched tree in which the Carrion Crow cannot move quickly, are due, as
Lorenz (1931) pointed out, to the Magpie's remarkably quick reaction time
and dodging ability which enable it to take such apparent risks with predators.
I think myself that, even when 20 or more Magpies are mobbing a crow and
close around it on all sides, only a Magpie whose own mate or young is held
or endangered by the crow, actually risks physically attacking it. Similarly
Jays Garrulus glandarius and Wood Pigeons Columba palumbus will
sometimes initiate attacks on Carrion Crows (and Jays also on Magpies)
when nestlings or recently fledged young are in danger, although at other
times they seek only to keep at a safe distance from a Carrion Crow and
immediately retreat if very closely approached by one (pers. obs.).
In my garden (watching with binoculars from the house) I have seen a
Carrion Crow suddenly fly at and seize a flying adult Black-headed Gull
Lams ridibundus (that looked 100% fit and showed no sign of impeded
flight) and fall to the lawn with it. But the gull struggled and managed to
peck at the crow every time the crow tried to peck it. This always caused
the crow to draw back out of reach of its victim's open bill. After a minute
or two, with a sudden violent struggle, the gull was free and flew off. A
young (trespassing) Carrion Crow was brought down in a similar manner
and given several vicious pecks but these ceased when it managed to present
its opened bill at its captor and it too got free and fled.
I have twice seen Wood Pigeons and once a feral pigeon grappling in
flight with a crow but each time before they reached the ground they got
free, though with the loss of many feathers. I have in the 19 years I have
lived in my present house seen scores, probably hundreds, of attempts by

Carrion Crows to catch Magpies, all of which failed. One male Magpie
which had a very slightly deformed or (more likely) injured wing but whose
flight did not show any imperfection unless one watched him very closely,
was especially liable to attacks. He visited my garden for four years, for the
last three of which he and his mate successfully reared young, and had many
escapes from the pair of Carrion Crows. He suddenly vanished though and
I think because a crow got him in the end. On two occasions I have seen, in
open fields in which horses are grazed adjacent to a public country park
(dog park would be a more descriptive title), a Magpie that had already
been captured by a crow. In each case my attention was drawn by the outcry
of Magpies already at the spot and the sight of others streaming towards it
from all directions.
In one case I was too far away and the ground between sloped slightly
upwards, so I could not see much detail but I think the victim escaped, as I
saw one Magpie emerge from the crowd, fly low and straight towards some
dense Hawthorn scrub and vanish into it and as this happened all went quiet,
the other Magpies at once disappeared and the crow also flew from the spot.
In the other case, which occurred on May 16th 1999, the Magpie was killed,
in spite of about 30 mobbing Magpies in a close circle around the crow, one
of which on three occasions (I think it was the same Magpie each time) flew
and struck or bounced off the crow's back. The crow stood, holding its
victim with its feet, and pecked at it again and again. This went on for about
15 minutes. Then another crow, evidently the Magpie catcher's mate, came
to the scene. Even before she alighted, the Magpies around retreated hastily
so that when the circle around the crow and its victim re-formed those nearest
were about 30ft (approx. 9m) instead of about 12ft (approx. 3.6m) away, as
before. At this point many of the Magpies left the scene, returning whence
they had come, but about a dozen (12) remained. The second crow walked
up to her mate and took a tentative peck at the captive Magpie. The crow
holding it was not pleased at this and made an apparently mildly threatening
intention movement of pecking towards her. This caused him to lose his
balance and the poor Magpie got free. But it could not fly and the crow
easily recaptured it and started hacking at it again. The female this time
remained near by though at a 'respectful' distance watching proceedings.
At last the Magpie lay inert on its back. Dead as I, and I think the crow
also, thought. To my surprise they made no attempt to eat or remove flesh
or guts to hide but walked away, the female leading. When they were about
60 yards (approx. 55m) away, the male stopped and looked back. I put my
binoculars on the 'corpse' and a second later to my horror, the Magpie moved
and straggled over onto its side and tried to stand but fell over again. At
once the crow flew back, alighted, jumped onto the Magpie and began
hacking at it in apparent fury. This time the Magpie was killed. The crow

made sure, by pausing several times to look back at it as he walked away
towards his mate who was about 150 yards (approx. 140m) away.
Though I do not generally think it is usually justifiable to interfere
between predator and prey, I should have been tempted to so on this occasion
but for the fact that all this took place on private land and within about 60
yards (approx. 55m) of some stables guarded by large dogs apparently kept
'free range'.
On May 30th 2001 1 saw two Magpies almost certainly a pair which, the
day before, had been seen with a flying juvenile which they were still feeding,
fiercely chasing a Carrion Crow. One, to my surprise, landed on its back,
grappling it and they fell together among the branches. At this point a second
Carrion Crow, presumably the mate of the one attacked, arrived and at once
both Magpies fled into denser cover.
On June 12th 2001 I saw a most surprising and to me heart-warming
Magpie versus Carrion Crow encounter. I was walking along a path in an
open area with scattered clumps of trees, mostly Hawthorns and feral apple
trees (not Crab Apples) more or less supporting Dog Roses Rosa canina.
On my left was an area where (owing to old concrete foundations of war-
time buildings) the grass was short but with clumps of taller herbs. Suddenly
out of 'the corner' of my left eye I saw a Carrion Crow flying obliquely
downwards in the fast, twisting, Sparrowhawk-like flight which they use
when trying to catch a Magpie or Jay they have spotted below them in the
open.
As I turned my binoculars on it, it caught a Magpie in the air about 4ft
(approx. 1.2m) above the ground. As it fell with it to the ground, a second
Magpie, that had been almost at the crow's tail, overtook it and alighted on
it. For a few seconds there was violent flapping and struggling of which I
could not see details owing to clumps of vegetation. Then suddenly both
Magpies were free, dodging around the crow, one attacking it from behind
(but only pecking at its tail, not jumping on it) whenever it turned to face the
other.
Then the crow hopped away fast, got airborne and flew away, one of the
Magpies dashing at and 'bouncing off' it as it did so. Then a second crow,
still at a distance, flew fast towards the scene. The Magpies at once saw it
and flew quickly across in front of me, alighted in the top of a tall Hawthorn
and at once went down into it out of my sight. But the crow did not return
and the second crow, presumably its mate, turned and flew after it.
Within seconds the two Magpies re-appeared on the very top of the tree
and exhibited the white parts of their plumage in typical manner. I had
thought at first that the Magpie caught by the crow would have been one of
the many juveniles then on the wing but both were adults and, from their
behaviour, evidently an established pair.

I was particularly surprised that the Magpie that had been caught by the
crow had not fled in panic when it got free but stayed and assisted
(consciously or not) its rescuer to frustrate the crow.
In my long life, much of it spent watching birds, I have only seen one
other instance of a bird succeeding in 'rescuing' another which had already
been caught by a predator. That was a Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, in
Rothesay, Isle of Bute, which, when a Herring Gull Lams argentatus caught
one of her ducklings, at once flew 'into its face' and somehow, the actual
movements were far too quick for me to see details, though I was within a
few yards (metres) of the birds, got it free from the gull

This year for the first time in more than 50 years, two pairs of Red-billed
Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax bred successfully on the Cornish coast.
The first pair was the wild pair living on the Lizard, which succeeded in
raising four young. The second was Paradise Park's Operation Chough
pair, which raised three young in a cliff-top aviary. This pair is being
encouraged to behave like wild birds and is therefore being kept in almost
total isolation, watched over only by CCTV cameras. The aviary has been
made as naturalistic as possible, with a small stream, rocks and bare earth,
and several places to nest and roost. The pair is also fed a largely naturalistic
diet by its volunteer carer Paul Carter. It consists mainly of ants and ant
eggs, woodlice, earwigs, centipedes and beetles, which are hidden so that
the birds have to search and probe for them. The pair is also provided with
insect-rich cowpats from organically farmed cows.
Next year Operation Chough hopes to build more breeding aviaries, near
the coast if possible, in which it hopes to produce more chough chicks with
the necessary foraging and survival skills to enable them to eventually be
released into the wild in Cornwall.
More information can be obtained from Operation Chough, Paradise
Park, Hayle, Cornwall TR27 4HB, UK. E-mail:info@chough.org

Introduction
The umbrellabirds are members of the family Cotingidae which is
distributed through forests of Central and South America, They belong to
the genus Cephalopterus, which consists of three species: C. ornatus, C.
penduliger and C. glabricollis.
Breeding male Long-wattled Umbrellabird.
This account refers to the hand-rearing of C. penduliger , the Long-wattled
Umbrellabird. C. penduliger inhabits the lower forested slopes of the western
flanks of the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, in the upper tropical and
subtropical zones (mainly 800m - 1,400m (approx. 2,600ft-4,600ft)). Its
diet seems to consist mostly of a variety of local fruits, insects ( Orthoptera
and Coleoptera ) and small vertebrates such as Anolis lizards. Here I give a
brief description of the hand-rearing protocol, describe the nesting site,
incubation, feeding and problems encountered.

Incubation
The nest was located about 3.5m (approx. 12ft) above the ground between
the branches of a tree in a mixed species aviary. The female built the nest
with fine twigs and it was possible to see the egg through the nest. The egg
was incubated by the female for the first 20 days, from the day the egg was
first seen in the nest (the exact date the egg was laid could not be determined).
On day 20 the egg was removed from the nest and placed in an incubator
(Grumbach) set at 37,1*C (98.8*F) and 60% humidity. After five days in
the incubator the egg hatched. The chick was covered in beautiful red down.
Hand-rearing protocol
The chick was kept in the incubator for the following eight hours, after
which the chick was transferred to a brooder (Grumbach) set at 35*C (95*F)
and 60% humidity. Feeding was started 10 hours post hatching. Exact(R)
macaw hand-rearing mix was used to feed the chick from day one to weaning
(day 57). From days one to seven only the Exact(R) mix was fed to the chick.
Brooder in which chick was kept.
We started with 3/4cc of weaning mix per feed which was increased gradually
as the chick grew bigger. For the first three days the chick was fed every
172 hours over a 20 hour period per day. On day seven we started to introduce
solid food, such as small pieces of papaya (pawpaw) and diced mice (pinkies),
into the diet. About day 30 the chick would eat up to three pinkies per feed,
which over the course of six feeds amounted to a total of up to 18 pinkies
per day. Solid foods such as blueberries, figs, papaya and hard-boiled egg
were increased gradually throughout that time.

The chick was kept in the brooder until day 20, during which time the
temperature was decreased gradually. Later the chick was set on an artificial
nest with a radiant heating lamp which was used at night. On day 35 the
chick was moved to a room with several perching places and was kept at a
constant temperature of 25 *C (77*F). There the bird had plenty of space to
jump from perch to perch and practise for its first flight (on day 40). After
day 48 the bird was moved into a cage measuring 50cm x 120cm x 60cm
(approx. 1ft 6in x 4ft x 2ft) within the main aviary. This was done to
encourage the young bird to feed itself without being distracted. Feeding
dishes were placed in several parts of the cage and another dish was placed
just outside the cage (see photo p. 112) so that the young bird could see other
birds feeding. As soon as it had learned to feed totally by itself it was moved
to a bigger cage (4m high x 4m deep x 3m wide (approx. 13ft high x 13ft
deep x 9ft 9in wide)) within the main aviary which contained several perching
places and lots of vegetation.
Problems encountered
During the hand-rearing of the chick a few problems were encountered.
About day 20 as the chick breathed a clicking sound could be heard when
close to it. A few days later it appeared to be having trouble breathing and
aspiration pneumonia was suspected. Prophylactic antibiotic and antimicotic
therapy through nebulization was initiated on day 25. This was performed
three times a day for 20 minutes for five days with enrofloxacin and
aminofilin. Latroconazol was administered orally for seven days. Humidity
was raised above 60% and the temperature was kept at approximately 30*C
(86*F). Respiratory wheezing disappeared gradually after one week. After
this feeding the chick became a hard task, as the chick tended to regurgitate
the food after each meal. This was solved by holding the chick's beak closed
and in an upright position for a few minutes after it had eaten. These were
the only problems encountered during the rearing. Otherwise the chick was
alert and playful most of the time and had an enormous appetite and a fast
growth rate.

NOTES FROM CHESTER ZOO - 2003

The successful breeding of the Red Bird of Paradise Paradisaea rubra
in the summer of 2003 was reported in the Avicultural Magazine Vol. 110,
No.l, pp.20-27 (2004). Other highlights of 2003 included the fledging of
our second Great Hombill Buceros bicornis , our second Victoria Crowned
Pigeon Goura victoria and our first breeding of the White-naped Crane Grus
vipio. Under the curatorship of Mike Jordan and the care of the bird and
parrot teams the collection continues to develop in line with the zoo's overall
conservation philosophy and direction to combine good welfare with exciting
and educational exhibits.
New arrivals included a pair of Montserrat Orioles Icterus oberi received
from the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Jersey Zoo. This is particularly
important in that this species is now Critically Endangered and with
continuing volcanic eruptions on Montserrat its future in the wild remains
uncertain. We also received two female Philippine Cockatoos Cacatua
haematuropygia to increase to four pairs our holding of this Critically
Endangered cockatoo. Plans are well advanced for a new off-show breeding
station to hold these and other threatened parrots.
Parrots bred in 2003, all of which were parent-reared, included Red-
tailed Amazons Amazona brasiliensis , Blue-throated Conures Pyrrhura
cruentata, Blue-winged Macaws Propyrrhura maracana, Derbyan Parakeets
Psittacula derbiana , Yellow-backed Chattering Lories Lorius garrulus
flavopalliatus and a Blue-eyed Cockatoo C. ophthalmica. Stella's Lorikeets
Charmosyna papou also fledged chicks but unfortunately these did not reach
independence. We hold two pairs of Hyacinth Macaws Anodorhynchus
hyacinthinus and the pair which laid for the first time in 2002 took this an
important stage further by hatching a chick in 2003. Whilst this chick failed
to survive it advanced our hopes of breeding these magnificent macaws.
Our Great Grey Owls Strix nebulosa reared a brood of six chicks which
in the late summer and through into the winter offered an impressive display
of a group of eight of these huge owls. This was especially the case in the
early evenings when their activity made these owls especially engaging.
Two Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata , three White-faced Scops Owls
Otus leucotis and a Tawny Frogmouth Podargus strigoides were also reared.
Two Schalow's Turacos Tauraco schalowi and two Violet Turacos
Musophaga violacea were reared and the Blue-winged Kookaburras Dacelo
leachii fledged three fine youngsters. Three White-collared Kingfishers
Halcyon chloris (two males and a female) were imported to join the three
unpaired females in our Islands in Danger exhibit.

Following their success in rearing a chick earlier in the year, in October
the Red Birds of Paradise nested again and hatched another chick that was
parent reared to 16 days old. In December a new young male hand-reared at
and imported from Bronx Zoo, New York, joined the young male reared at
Chester, and both are now housed together in an adjoining aviary to the
breeding pair of Red Birds of Paradise. In the same aviary as the pair of
Victoria Crowned Pigeons again reared a chick in 2003, the White-naped
Pheasant Pigeons Otidiphaps nobilis aruensis laid eggs for the first time.
Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita , Eurasian Spoonbills Platalea
leucorodia and Little Egrets Egretta garzetta nested in the Europe on the
Edge aviary. As a breeding aviary it presents some interesting challenges in
terms of managing competition for food between different occupants.
Successful rearing of the spoonbills was achieved through the keepers giving
supplementary food to the chick in the nest whilst the egrets successfully
reared chicks without keeper assistance. The recently paired European Black
Vultures Aegypius monachus also nested but were unsuccessful in hatching
the egg.
We again tried artificial insemination with our White-naped and Wattled
Cranes Bugeranus carunculatus . Our male White-naped Crane is genetically
important and we are encouraged that although he is now at least 55 years
of age he continues to produce motile semen. In 2003 artificial insemination
resulted in the female White-naped Crane laying two fertile eggs.
Unfortunately she is inexperienced as a breeder and did not sit on the eggs.
One was incubated by our pair of Red-crowned Cranes G. japonensis. The
pair, which has been so successful within the managed European Endangered
Species Programme (EEP) breeding programme that we have been requested
to limit the pair's breeding, are excellent and experienced parents and
successfully reared the chick. The second egg was artificially incubated
and the chick fostered by a bantam hen and that too was successfully reared.
Waterfowl reared included Black-necked Swans Cygnus melanocoryphus,

The pair of Great Hombills in the Asian Elephant House as in previous
years nested early in the year. Mating was observed in mid-January and
two eggs were laid in early February. A nest video camera was used to
record nesting behaviour. One egg hatched March 23rd whilst the other
failed to hatch. The chick was last seen to be fed by the female on March
27th after which there were no further signs of it and the female broke out of
the nest on April 7th. Later in the year the female re-entered the nest and
began mudding-up again in late September. Two eggs were again laid, the
first on October 6th and the second the following day. A single chick hatched
on or before November 8th and to our delight fledged on January 11th 2004,
making a fitting finale to our 2003 breeding season.

Introduction
The Mauritius Fody Foudia rubra is one of only six endemic passerine
species remaining on the island of Mauritius. Fodies are a divergent group
of the family Ploceidae, the weaver birds. The seven species of fody occur
on the western Indian Ocean islands of Madagascar, Aldabra, Comores,
Rodrigues, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Some species are generalist feeders,
eating a variety of food items such as seeds, fruits, insects and nectar.
However, the Mauritius Fody has a more specialised diet and feeds mainly
on insects and has evolved a brush-tipped tongue for sipping nectar.

citrinus, Black River Gorges National Park.
Classified as Critically Endangered (BirdLife International, 2001), the
declining population of the Mauritius Fody is estimated to be between 100-
120 pairs (Safford, 1994, 1997; Nichols et al. 2000). Loss of suitable native
habitat throughout Mauritius and predation from introduced exotic mammals,

primarily the Black Rat Rattus rattus and Crab-eating Macaque Macaca
fascicularis , have confined it to small areas of upland forest within the Black
River Gorges National Park. There a 6 hectare (approx. 14.8 acres) grove
of exotic Japanese Cedars Cryptomeria japonica, surrounded by and inter-
planted with native forest, known as Pigeon Wood, is of particular importance
to the species. The prickly, sap-laden cedars provide some security for nesting
Mauritius Fodies and as they produce no edible fruit are less frequently
used by arboreal mammals. Pigeon Wood holds one of the largest
concentrations of Mauritius Fodies (nine to 10 pairs) and studies have shown
that nesting attempts had considerably higher success (45%) in C. japonica ,
compared to only 6% in other (native and exotic) tree species (Safford, 1994,
1997).
As the Mauritius Fody remains extremely vulnerable, the Mauritian
Wildlife Foundation's (MWF's) passerine team has in recent years
concentrated its attention on this species and is investigating ways to increase
the dwindling population. The planting of additional areas with the non *
invasive C. japonica and the control or eradication of introduced mammalian
predators will play an important role in the long-term survival of the Mauritius
Fody. However, other intensive management techniques may have to be
implemented in the short to medium period to ensure the survival of this
species.
One option would be to harvest or rescue chicks from nests and hand-
rear them in captivity. The hand-reared young birds could then be
translocated to other locations, such as safe predator-free offshore islands.
Some of the hand-reared birds could be established in captivity to act as
founder captive breeding stock to produce young birds for future release.
As only two Mauritius Fodies had ever previously been hand-reared and
had subsequently died before reaching independence (Smart, 1992), and
only a small number had been maintained briefly in captivity prior to
translocation, very little was known about the captive husbandry requirements
of the Mauritius Fody.
During part of the 2002-2003 breeding season (October-February), a
trial was implemented to harvest the nests of Mauritius Fodies, hand-rear
the young and establish them in the aviaries of the Gerald Dune!] Endemic

The MWF passerine field team located fody nests in Pigeon Wood and
in adjacent privately owned hunting land outside the national park. Daily
nest watches were made and close observations of nest building, incubation
and early chick rearing were recorded. Nests designated for harvesting were
removed when chicks were estimated to be at least three days of age. A

skilled tree climber collected each complete dome-shaped nest, secured it
in a plastic tub and lowered it to the ground on a rope.
The nests were then driven to the Black River aviaries, which were about
45 minutes away. As the chicks were at least three days of age and the nests
were heavily lined with the feathers of Pink Pigeons Nesoenas mayeri it
was thought unnecessary to transport them in a portable incubator. On arrival
at the aviaries, the chicks were removed from the nests, weighed and placed
in their sibling groups in small plastic tubs lined with tissue paper and part
of the nest substrate (fine twigs, grasses and plant rootlets). This material
provided a firm, non-slip surface on which the chicks could grip. As
Mauritius Fody nests are domed structures, a sheet of paper towelling was
placed over each nest bowl, so that the chicks were in what resembled
covered, darkened nests.
Brooding
Depending on their estimated age the chicks were placed in one of three
forced air Roll X incubators set at different temperatures. Chicks estimated
to be three to four days of age were brooded at a temperature of 34*C (93.2*F).
Chicks estimated to be six to seven days of age were placed in an incubator
set a degree cooler. At eight to 10 days the temperature was set at 32*C
(89.6*F), from 11-14 days it was set at 31*C (87.8*F) and from day 14 until
the chicks fledged at 16-18 days it was maintained at 29*C 30*C (84.2*F~
86*F). Humidity was maintained at 50% 65% RFI throughout the rearing
period using shallow trays containing de ionised water. The incubators were
in an air-conditioned room maintained at a temperature of 25*C (77*F).

Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981856333333333" page_id="56266019"  page_num="121" year="" vol="">
Chicks were given their first feed two hours after collection. By that
time they were hungry and eager to feed from tweezers (forceps). Vibrations
caused by opening the incubator lid were usually enough to trigger a begging
response. Chicks reluctant to beg were stimulated to do so by tapping on
the side of the nest bowl.
Food offered comprised of bee larvae, scrambled egg (plain egg, beaten
and cooked in a microwave oven for two minutes) and small pieces of papaya.
Every second feed this was lightly dusted with Nutrobal multivitamin powder.
Chicks reared later in the season were also fed pureed or finely chopped
pieces of pinkie mouse as part of their diet. This food source which was not
available during the rearing of the earlier chicks (and is not included in
Table 1) replaced bee larvae during alternative feeds.
Twelve feeds per day at l 1 h hourly intervals were given to three day old
chicks. The first feed each day was given at 6.00am and the last feed at
10.30pm. The intervals between feeds were increased to every two hours

and the number of feeds was gradually decreased as the chicks developed.
Days four to six, chicks received 11 feeds a day, days seven to nine they
received nine feeds a day, with the last feed at 10.00pm. Between 11-18
days of age or until they fledged, if sooner, chicks receiving eight feeds a
day, with the last feed at 9.00pm.

Mauritius Fody chicks have an elongated crop that is clearly visible (on
the right side of the neck) when full. It was important that the crop was not
over-filled and that it had emptied prior to the next feed.
Large faecal sacs were produced by each chick (up to 2g in weight from
older chicks), normally after the first morsel of food had been swallowed.
Faecal sacs produced by young chicks were removed from the nest after
feeding, older chicks were encouraged to defaecate over the edge of the nest
onto a piece of tissue paper, thus maintaining a clean environment for the
young birds. After feeding, the tweezers were washed and placed in a solution
of Virkon S virucidal disinfectant at a dilution rate of 1:100. Tweezers
were rinsed prior to the next feed.
Weighing
Chicks were weighed before every second feed using Acculab digital
scales which are accurate to O.lg. Three of the 14 Mauritius Fody chicks
were harvested from the wild when they were 13-14 days of age. These
birds were initially very nervous and were therefore not put through the
additional stress of being weighed.

Chicks fledged at 16-18 days old. At that age they had become very
active and were able to fly and perch well. All left the nest at the same time,
even though there may have been an age difference between them of up to
two days. Once they had left the nest bowl they were removed from the
incubator and placed in a wire mesh cage 60cm long x 40cm wide x 40cm
high (approx. 2ft long x 1ft 4in wide x 1ft 4in high) furnished with natural
branches for perching. The fledging cage was kept in a room maintained at
a temperature of 28*C-29*C (82.4*F-84.2*F).

Within hours of being placed in the cage fledglings were observed pecking
at the spiked fruit and two days after being placed in the cage (at 18-20 days
old) were observed bathing. Tweezer feeds of bee larvae, egg and papaya
were offered every two hours throughout the day, with the last feed being
given at 6.00pm. After two days the number of tweezer feeds were reduced
to four per day to encourage the chicks to feed themselves. After four to
five days in the cage (when aged 20-23 days old) they became reluctant to
feed from the tweezers and began picking at the food in the dish. To further
encourage this bee larvae were dropped from above into the dish at regular
intervals throughout the day.
After nine to 10 days in the cage (when aged 25-28 days old), the chicks
were usually self-feeding and independent, although they did still
occasionally solicit for food. At that time they also received a tube of artificial
nectar (Avesnectar) and, when available, hibiscus flowers and those of the
Bottlebrush Callistemon citrinus.
Once they were independent the young birds were moved to a larger
cage 90cm x 50cm x 50cm (approx.3ft x 1ft 8m x 1ft Sin) in which they had
more room to exercise. During the day they were placed in an outside aviary,
in the weaning cage, to acclimatise to the hotter conditions. The cage was
covered with a cloth and placed in a shady position to prevent the birds
from overheating. At night the cage was returned to the rearing room and a
low wattage light was left on overnight.
Outside aviaries
After five to seven days acclimatising to the outside temperatures, the
young birds were moved to one of the aviary shelters (2m long x 2m high x
1.5m deep (approx. 6ft 6in long x 6ft 6in high x 5ft deep)), where they were
confined for a period of 24-48 hours. Once accustomed to their surroundings
and feeding well, the young fodies were given access to an outside aviary.
This was 8m long x 3m high x 2.5m wide (approx. 26ft long x 9ft 9m high
x 8ft 3in wide), covered with 13mm (Ain) wire mesh. Each aviary had the
back quarter of the roof covered in shade cloth and was connected to a
shelter. Each aviary had a substrate of soil, grass and leaf litter and was
planted with a number of shrubs and small trees including Bottlebrush,
hibiscus, Japanese Cedar, bamboo and Pongam Pongamia pinnata, A
concrete food platform, surrounded by a shallow water-filled moat, prevented
ants from gaining access to the birds' food. At 7.30am the fodies received a
dish containing insectivorous mix, egg, grated carrot, finely diced fruit and
bee larvae, and pieces of fruit were spiked on branches throughout the aviary.
Additional egg, bee larvae or small to medium-sized cockroaches, crickets
and leaf-hoppers were given every two hours during the day. A tube of
nectar was provided at 2.00pm.

Insects form a major part of the fodies' diet and the birds were frequently
seen searching among the foliage and leaf litter. Flying insects such as
moths and cockroaches were chased and caught on the wing. Large moss
covered rotten logs and branches were collected in the national park and
placed in the aviaries. These were an immediate focus of attention for the
fodies, which climbed up and down the trunks of the logs, probing for
arthropods in a manner similar to a nuthatch Sitta spp. Night-lights were
left on in the aviary shelters to attract night-flying insects into the aviaries.

During the four month period October 2002-February 2003, the first stage
of the Mauritius Fody recovery programme was initiated, involving intensive
management techniques. During this first trial season 100% success was
achieved when 14 Mauritius Fodies F rubra were harvested from nests in
the wild, hand-reared to independence and established in aviaries at the
Gerald Durrell Endemic Wildlife Sanctuary. This was the first time that
Mauritius Fodies have been successfully reared to independence. In an
earlier attempt in 1992, the two chicks being reared died at an early age.
Plans for future collaborative work between the Durrell Wildlife
Conservation Trust and the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation, include perfecting
artificial incubation parameters, so that fody eggs rather than nestlings can
be harvested from nests in the wild, greatly reducing the risk of nest
depredation during the vulnerable incubation period. There are also plans
to design hand-rearing and captive husbandry protocols and a trial programme
for releasing this species onto the predator free Me aux Aigrettes (Island or
Isle of Egrets).

(continued from Vol.l 10, No.2, pp.83-90 (2004))
I had often wondered why in this area Woodcock nest much earlier than
in areas a few miles (kilometres) away (as the crow flies) where Dr Graham
Heron was doing his study on Woodcock in Whitwell Wood. We had young
chicks when he had only just got eggs. This was especially evident when I
caught my first ever young Woodcock, which was in mid-February. As it
was about three weeks old, I calculated that it must have hatched from an
egg laid over the Christmas-New Year period.
Given that the male Woodcock is polygamous and takes no part in the
incubation of the eggs or in the rearing of the young, I had often wondered
how the female Woodcock manages to successfully hatch her eggs at a time
of the year when there is usually frost and snow about. As the Woodcock's
nest is only a shallow depression in the ground lined with leaves, it seemed
to me a wonder that the female could hatch and rear young in late January-
early February.
Another founder member of our club told me that at university he had
done his thesis on the geology of the area in which we live and that this area
had once been part of a shallow inland sea (the Zechstein Sea), which had
laid down a rich deposit of coral, which now takes the form of magnesium
limestone. This belt of limestone which varies from six miles to nine miles
(approx. 9km-14km) wide along its length, starts at Nottingham and runs
diagonally northwards to the coast just south of Newcastle. As our village
and the surrounding woodlands are situated on this strip of magnesium
limestone, though only near the edge of it, the soil is very rich in worms and
other soil invertebrates. In one spadeful of soil we can find approximately
30 worms, whereas if we go to the border of this, which is sandy clay and
'Bunter' sandstone, a spadeful of soil contains no worms.
The conclusions I have reached are that, given that we are situated on a
belt of magnesium limestone, with an abundance of food and patches of
marshland created by the springs in the woods, plus the fact that we are in a
shallow valley and are sheltered from heavier falls of snow by the Pennines
and higher ground to the west, Woodcock in this area come into breeding
condition extra early - I have since seen them roding on Christmas Day.
The favourable conditions enable the female Woodcock to find food quite
easily within a reasonable distance of the nest - but how did the eggs hatch
successfully when she needed to leave the nest to feed on frosty nights or
mornings? I was not to get a possible answer until years later.

The Wood Mouse association
A possible answer came whilst I was examining a Woodcock's nest one
March. The eggs had hatched successfully and the female and young had
left in the last few days of March. Whilst I was examining the eggshells I
noticed that the bottom of the nest was very loose, and on probing gently
with my fingers, found to my amazement that underneath the Woodcock's
nest was a nest or hibernation chamber of a Wood Mouse Apodermus
sylvaticus. I lifted the large round nest out of the ground and it immediately
became clear to me that the Woodcock had been using the Wood Mouse
nest or hibernation chamber to provide a form of central heating! I decided
that if by probing around the female Woodcock could find the nest of a
Wood Mouse which was just below the surface, she would nest on the top of
it and the warmth from below would allow the female Woodcock to leave
her eggs for a few minutes to feed, day or night, knowing that the warmth
from the Wood Mouse's nest would keep the eggs warm.
Homing ability and feeding
My first insight into the Woodcock's homing ability came about many
years ago, when a young Woodcock was brought to me by a 15 years old
lad, who had found it in the woods. This was over 20 years ago, before I
started my Woodcock study.
Previous to that only one other Woodcock had been brought to me, which
I reared successfully. At first I fed it on worms, but at the rate it gobbled
them up I soon realised that it would be impossible to keep up the required
supply to sustain its appetite and growth. At the time I was keeping members
of the crow family and to supplement the worm supply I would add minced
ox or sheep's heart. As this worked quite well I decided to try feeding it to
the Woodcock, but instead of mincing it I cut it into fine strips so as to
resemble worms. I put these in the Woodcock's feeding tray and it ate them
along with the worms. Having successfully reared the Woodcock, I released
it back into the wild.
So, when the 15 years old lad brought me the young Woodcock, I already
knew how to successfully rear it. I kept it for about a month and then released
it into the wood at the bottom of my garden, about 50 yards (approx. 50m)
from my gate. In the weeks following I often caught glimpses of it at the
edge of the wood and very near my gate. The lad who caught the Woodcock
was a keen young naturalist and frequently came to see it (and the other
birds I had) while I was rearing it. He spent many happy hours in the wood
looking for the Woodcock and many times fetched me to see it amongst the
bushes in the wood, just 20 yards - 30 yards (approx. 20m-30m) from my
gate.
Some 30 yards - 40 yards (approx. 30m-40m) into the wood is a 'ride'

that runs parallel with my house. On the ride is a damp muddy patch and 1
would often see the bird standing there. When I approached, it would just
squat down and not fly away until I was but a yard or two (approx. 1 m-2m)
from it. This went on for two to three years, after which I never saw it
anymore and assumed an accident had befallen it.
Often seen on my garden path which runs some 10 yards (approx. 10m)
down to the back gate, were the droppings (faeces) of Woodcock, which are
impossible to mistake for those of any other bird. Large creamy blobs each
with a brown spot in the middle, they looked not unlike fried eggs. The
brown is actually soil from the worms the birds have eaten.
Over the years, when taking clutches of Woodcock's eggs, after rearing
the young I would pick out one I wanted to keep. If it was a female that I
wanted, I would choose one that made no sound whatsoever, knowing that
if I wanted a male I should choose one that made lots of squeaking sounds.
The remaining birds would then be released back into the wild when they
were about four to five months of age and fully grown. They would remain
in the vicinity of my back gate and I would often see them there in the
winter when snow was on the ground, jumping up and down and looking
like giant moths in the moonlight.

Observations on behaviour and coloration
In the first few days after young Woodcock have hatched, I have noticed
that if I make or cause a sudden noise, they will as one, lay flat on the
ground with their beaks stretched out in front of them. When they are in this
position, I am amazed how they resemble coiled snakes. The young are
buffy-yellow, with a dark brown area on the back and small spots towards

the rump, along with a distinctively patterned head. I imagine that when
seen from above by a predator, perhaps a hawk or Jay Garrulus glandarius,
these markings instantly send an 1 am poisonous 5 signal, as many know
that wasps and yellow/biown caterpillars are not good to eat. Therefore,
young Woodcock have evolved this snake-like patterning to enable them to
escape danger.
Changes In coloration
In the Shooting Times and other sporting magazines much has been
written over the years about differences in the coloration of the Woodcock's
plumage. One line of thinking has even suggested that there are two types
of Woodcock. What has become obvious to me, having kept them in captivity,
is that the Woodcock's coloration changes with the seasons.
The beautiful ivory and brown fern like patterns on the Woodcock's
upperparts can be totally different in colour in the winter than in the spring.
At the time of writing (winter), the one that I have in captivity (which is
almost a year old), had you seen it three weeks ago would have been hardly
recognizable as the same bird. The darker brown markings, previously drab
and dull, have now changed to a deep brown-black, with the lighter parts
changing in tone to a rusty-red. The lined pattern on the head also changes
to the same colouring as the upperparts at this time. The Woodcock's
underparts take on a rusty-red appearance.
The darkening of the plumage coincides with the melting of the snow,
when all the leaves that fell in the autumn are wet, black and rotting, and
affords the Woodcock marvellous camouflage amidst the vegetation of late
winter - early spring. As spring starts to arrive, the darker feathers are
replaced by tawny-reddish feathers and this seasonal partial moult continues
from season to season, so as to afford the best camouflage at all times.
When I appeared on Yorkshire Television with David Bellamy to talk
about the early findings of my Woodcock study, he was very interested when
I likened the Woodcock's ability to change its coloration to suit each seasonal
background, to a chameleon's ability to change its colour to suit its
background. He was also interested in the Woodcock's ability to 'shadow'
its prey. Whenever I threw a worm onto the floor of the Woodcock's cage,
the Woodcock would approach it very slowly, stopping each moment or two
and with both feet firmly on the floor, gently move its whole body backwards
and forwards, just as a chameleon does when stalking its prey. This I assume
is to match the movements of the vegetation as it is moved by the breeze,
and makes the Woodcock less conspicuous. I have found that if a sudden
shadow is cast, or a sudden movement is made towards a worm on the surface,
it will in no time disappear down the nearest hole, whereas a stealthy approach
will not startle it.

The Woodcock's bill
Observations on the Woodcock's bill show that the constant probing for
food in firmer or harder ground, necessitates the fairly constant renewal of
the upper mandible (top only).
In the first nine months of the Woodcock's life, the bill is only
strengthened, which starts as a thickening at the top of the upper mandible.
This shows as a bulge, lead grey in colour, which moves down between the
inner and outer surfaces of the bill and is visible for two to three weeks.
After the bird has reached one year of age, for a two to three week period
before the regrowth is about to begin, the bird will eat ravenously, as so it is
building up its body weight; then as the regrowth begins the bird becomes
reasonably quiet and less active and spends more time sitting, as if it is
conserving its energy. Throughout this period the bird continues to eat the
normal amount of food that I provide. In the wild, what I have described
above, usually takes place in early spring, when the worms are near the
surface and plenty of surface food is available.

The adult's bill starts to thicken at the base of the upper mandible.
In the case of the adult bird, the regrowth goes a stage further. It starts
off in the same way as that of the younger bird, but the bulge is more
pronounced and, in the last week, the bulge will erupt and pieces of the bill
will flake off, leaving the new bill underneath. It is rather like what happens
when we damage a finger nail and have to wait for the new nail to form
underneath and slowly force off the old nail.

Sonar theory
The Woodcock moves around continually touching the ground with the
tip of its bill. Then, it will suddenly stop, push its bill down just below the
surface, and then appear to be concentrating deeply. It will then push its bill
further into the ground and concentrate again, before finally pushing its bill
down to the depth at which it has located its prey. I believe it may be assisted
in this by a type of sonar, wherein the vibrations produced by the movement
of the prey are received via tactile nerves along the inside surfaces of the
upper and lower mandibles. These are then amplified by the bird's ear and
are received in the brain. Although I have been studying the Woodcock for
over 16 years now and have found out many remarkable things, which are
laid out in this account of my study, I feel that certain aspects, such as the
sonar theory need more specialised attention than I am able to give.
Bill and tongue actions during feeding
When the Woodcock is probing in the ground, the prehensile section of
the bill makes it easier for it to grasp worms. It is further assisted by
backward-facing serrations on the surface of the tongue. These lay flat to
allow the tongue to slide forward but as it is retracted, rise and help the bird
to grip the worm and transport it further back along the bill. The bill is
clamped shut as the tongue slides forward, then the pressure is released to
allow the bird to transport the worm back along the bill. This action is
repeated until the worm is fastened onto the spikes at the back of the tongue
(see photo p. 137) and is eventually swallowed. A saliva gland lubricates
the tongue to assist its rapid movement within the bill.

Taken with a 1-5 macro lens, this photo shows the 'worm-hooking spikes' at the back of
the Woodcock's tongue. The tongue was taken from from a badly injured Woodcock
which died soon after being brought to me. Under magnification I discovered the two
smaller spikes between the two larger, outer, hard thorn-like ones. Supple membranes
attach the tongue to muscle in the throat.
Saliva gland
When a captive Woodcock is offered food, this will instantly trigger the
saliva gland. The gland is situated at the point where the prehensile part of
the bill begins. My sketch (p. 138) shows the saliva bubbling out of both
sides of the bill. My years of observation have led me to the conclusion that
the Woodcoock's saliva may have a three-fold purpose: as well as lubricating
and aiding the sometimes rapid movement of the tongue, some agent in the
saliva may assist in attracting prey and upon coming into contact with the
prey (worms) may cause some degree of paralysis and thereby assist the
Woodcock in extracting them.
Delousing
Each week I would clean out my Woodcock cages. Having done this I
would put in two bucketfuls of freshly dug soil from the wood at the bottom
of my garden. The only exception was in the winter, when if the soil was
too wet, I would use fine peat.

Sketch showing saliva bubbling out of both
sides of the bill.
On one occasion after having put in the soil from the wood and put the
Woodcock back into its cage, I noticed that it was behaving in an unusual
manner. The Woodcock was excitedly probing in one spot and being an
imprinted bird I was able to observe this at very close quarters. I could see
that the bird was taking something up in its bill. After a few minutes it
would stop taking up whatever it was, and was then seen making movements
in its throat and crop. After a while the Woodcock would regurgitate a small
pellet. This it would hold in the tip of its bill and run it through the feathers
on its back. When I examined the discarded pellets, I discovered they were
pellets of clay and stuck to them were minute flat lice of the type that live on
many birds.
This behaviour was probably due to the fact that the Woodcock's upper
mandible is longer than the lower mandible; also the upper mandible has a
hook at the tip to enable the bird to get a grasp on worms and these make it
difficult, if not impossible, for Woodcock to remove flat lice in the same
way as finches, the Robin Erithacus ruhecula and other birds, whose bills
are ideally adapted for removing minute objects etc. Therefore, the
Woodcock has evolved this clever method of getting rid of lice. When I
examined the spot where the Woodcock has been excitedly probing, I found
a lump of clay to size of a golf ball. It was blue-grey in colour and of a
coarser type than most of the clay found in this area.
I have found that captive Woodcock kept indoors, unlike birds in the
wild, do not need to bathe as frequently, because they are not out in the
elements, constantly getting wet; and in the drier indoor environment there
is more chance of them getting lice than if they were out in the wild.

At migration time in October -November, a bad time of the year,
Woodcock make long journeys over the North Sea from Scandinavia, and
this led me to wonder if they have the ability to swim. So, I experimented
first with a young Woodcock. I filled my bath with water and put the young
Woodcock into the bath and found that it could swim quite well. I next tried
an adult Woodcock and this also swam quite successfully as I filmed it with
my Super 8 cine camera.
I concluded from these experiments that when migrating from
Scandinavia, if due to freak weather Woodcock are forced down onto the
sea, they could quite easily float for some considerable time and when the
weather clears be able to continue their migration. Being birds that spend
so much time in and around wet places they have well oiled feathers. These
alone should stop them from sinking and, along with their ability to swim
would, I believe, make it quite feasible for them to land on the water - rest -
and then continue.
The seeming ability to suppress its scent
Over the years, sportsmen, hunters as well as naturalists, had thought
that the Woodcock was able to suppress its scent to avoid detection. This
probably came about because dogs, such as spaniels, would appear to pass
them without putting them up, and it was only when the hunter almost trod
on the bird that it would fly off.
I would like to put forward a possible explanation as to why this should
occur. My first insight was when my captive Woodcock would refuse their
food when the temperature fell below freezing. They would not start to eat
again until the temperature was a reasonable way back above freezing, even
though I provided them with fresh food each day. This behaviour could,
according to the severity of the weather, last two to three days, after which
they would eat ravenously.
This led me to believe that Woodcock must have some kind of inbuilt
biological clock which tells them when the ground is too hard and conditions
are too bad for them to go looking for food. So, Woodcock sit and possibly
go semi-dormant, which would mean that their heartbeat slows down and
they live off their existing body fat. In this case the body would produce
little or no scent.
I would like to conclude by saying that I believe they are not able to
suppress their scent at will, just to avoid detection.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
LEG DEFORMITIES IN CHICKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992825333333334" page_id="56266038"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">
Thanks to Louise Peat for raising again the issue of leg deformities in
chicks (. Avicultural Magazine Vol.110, No.2, pp.71-75 (2004)). My
experience with turacos is that I, like others, have found, as she has, that
problems often occur irregularly under apparently unchanged conditions,
sometimes affecting one chick in an otherwise healthy brood (see Breeding
the White-cheeked Touraco by Hewston, Avicultural Magazine Vol.90, No. 1,
pp.209-215 (1974)).
My feeling is that problems with turaco chicks are rarely related to
calcium/vitamin D 3 deficiency, but more often, as Louise suggested, to nest
substrate. In these cases the condition initially involves perosis, though bone
deformities may follow as a result. Another nutritional factor may be vitamin
B 2 (riboflavin) deficiency, which can cause a condition known as curly toe
paralysis in chickens. Richard Mark Martin mentioned ( Cage &amp; Aviary
Birds, 18th March 1976) that London Zoo successfully treated turaco chicks
with B 2 . injections, and I am sure there was a reference to this in one of the
</bodyText>

Zoological Society of London Annual Reports, possibly 1969. I supplemented
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9915404375" page_id="56266038"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">
the diet of affected chicks with riboflavin, which I think had some effect.
Certainly inward curling toes, whether from B 2 deficiency or other causes,
often lead to splayed legs as the feet are unable to grip properly and the legs
inevitably slip outwards as the bird tries to move. If the problem is not
noticed until the bird has developed splayed legs, with possible associated
perosis and bone deformities, the original cause may not be diagnosed.
Thinking back to when I bred turacos, I don't remember encountering
any leg problems with turaco chicks while using willow baskets or boxes
with carpet, as a base for all nests, and offering breeding pairs a diet of fruit
(based on banana, not apple) with a little universal food (usually Bogena)
and soaked mynah pellets (Witte Molen). These pellets were taken in quantity
by most pairs with chicks.
Louise also mentioned curled toes in pheasants. These are usually thought
to be caused by poor incubation or inbreeding, but a fascinating note in a
recent WPA Newsletter, I think by John Corder, considered the role of stress,
with some interesting case histories.

CURASSOWS AND RELATED BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982777131578947" page_id="56266039"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
Thirty years ago the first monograph of the family Cracidae - the
Chachalacas, Guans and Curas sows - was published. The authors, Jean
Delacour and Dean Amadon, both now deceased, were ornithologists, with
Jean Delacour also of course an aviculturist of great repute and President of
the Avicultural Society from 1972-1985. Their monograph, of which only
3,400 copies were printed, quickly became a collector's edition. I remember
acquiring a copy and sending it to Jean Delacour to be autographed. The
copy went astray and was never found. He sent me a note to insert into
another copy, if I could find one. After much searching I found another
copy and the note sits between the pages of this treasured first edition.
Next to it on my bookshelf is now a copy of the recently published new
second edition. Updated by Josep del Hoyo and Anna Motis, and published
by Lynx Edicions in association with the American Museum of Natural
History, it has lost none of the charm of the original edition. The family
Cracidae is described in detail - from the variations in the trachea to
reproduction and there is detailed information on the genera and species.
Systematics are discussed and there are descriptions of these birds in the
field and in aviculture. As well as all the original drawings and plates by
Albert Earl Gilbert, there are new plates by him depicting the chicks of
some species and the plates that correspond to the family from the Handbook
of the Birds of the World.
Some of the birds of this family are common, others are elusive and
rare. I can still recall in awe finding in a remote village in south-western
Guatemala a Homed Guan Oreophasis derbianus - a bird then of almost
mythical rarity and beauty. It was to me like encountering a unicorn! The
bird was seen in a totally different light by its owners, who kept it with
turkeys in a makeshift cage. It had been found as a chick and was being
reared to be eaten. I rushed home to write to Delacour about the bird, but
sadly he had recently passed away.
This spectacular species adorns the cover of the new edition. At the
time that I found this species in Guatemala, my sole source of reference to it
was Delacour and Amadou's monograph, which confirmed the bird's rarity.
Its future appeared uncertain and it was perhaps doomed to disappear. The
new edition, in a separate chapter that updates information in the first edition,
sheds more light on this bird, stating: "This guan has been discovered at
new localities....(and has) become one of the most studied members of the
family." Such information proves the exceptional value of this book and
allows the reader to leam about advances that have been made and of the

current status of the various species 30 years after the publication of the
original edition.
Cracids, because of their large size, are not suitable for everyone to keep.
In my experience they are most popular in Latin American countries, where
there are collections that specialise in these birds. Ornithologists and
conservationists are interested in the group because these birds are
barometers of the environment. 'Their large size and tameness doom them
to early extirpation once the forest is broken up by burning and slashing and
once hunting begins. When they go, other wildlife will soon follow" wrote
Amadon. Reading this book brought home to me how important they are as
barometers of the environment and how conservation efforts must be doubled
in many areas. The book gives the reader a master plan, as it were, as to
where efforts need to be focused.
Curas sows and Related Birds by Jean Delacour and Dean Amadon,
updated by Josep del Hoyo and Anna Motis, is priced #42.50 in the UK.

The author of Aras (Macaws), Lars Lepperhoff, is a Swiss parrot keeper,
well-known in German speaking countries for his enthusiasm for these birds.
He has been closely involved with them since childhood and this interest
has been carried over into his professional life. Apart from employment at
the privately owned breeding facility Hyacinthinus, he is editor of the Swiss
magazine Gefiederter Freund and parrot breeding expert of the Swiss
organisation Exotis Schweiz.
Published in German earlier this year by Ulmer Verlag, Aras has 222
pages with 118 colour photographs, 14 sketches and 17 distribution maps.
It has 10 chapters which deal with the systematics and status of macaws,
with a separate entry for each of the species, their acquisition and keeping
as breeding birds, their feeding and health care, as well as a section on
potential diseases and illnesses contributed by veterinarian Willi Haefel.
The work concludes with a 14 page index and included in this section is a
register of species and references.
Although there is a wealth of experience and experiences within the
text, the structure of the book is I found very confusing, with scientific
information, anecdotes, breeding advice, reports of visits to see macaws in
the wild, and charts, all mixed up and interspersed with tips in coloured
boxes. There are some errors in the naming of taxa, some spelling errors of
author's names and print errors in German characters in some of the tables
and charts. There are also errors of fact such as on p.133, on which it is
stated that Emperor Rudolph II had a blue macaw in the 16th century, whereas

the illustration in the Bestiaire of Rudolph II shows it to have been a Blue
and Yellow Macaw. There are omissions, such as on p. 137, where the author
fails to mention that the Lear's Macaws at Mulhouse Zoo were transferred
to Harry Sissen and were subsequently stolen. There is also an absence of
information on important long-standing projects such as the Hyacinthine
Macaw project directed by Neiva Guedes in the Pantanal and the Scarlet
Macaw project under the leadership of Dr Christopher Vaughan in Costa
Rica, both of which have been operating successfully for over a decade.
However the author has succeeded in bringing together the experiences
of many macaw keepers and can perhaps provide the reader with advice and
information to implement in his or her own macaw aviaries. The six pages
of literary references will enable the reader to investigate other sources of
information and in the addresses and references section European
conservation projects, parrot conservation organisations, magazines and
breeding clubs, tourist companies, zoos and bird parks are listed.
The photographic images are excellent. The reviewer knows from
experience how difficult it is to get acceptable images of birds in the wild.
The effort, patience and dedication required is usually much underestimated.
Since no book on parrots will sell well without good photographic material,
perhaps photographers of parrots in the wild and enthusiasts such as Karin
and Karl-Heinz Lambert, Rosemary Low and Franz Pfeffer should be more
prominently acknowledged.
If this book is published in English it will require more than a good
translator to convey the author's enthusiasm and knowledge. Also, a re-
working of its structure will almost certainly be necessary.

At the recent Council Meeting, held on September 18th at Marwell
Zoological Park, long-time member Robin Restall was elected a Vice
President of the Avicultural Society.
Robin, who lives in Caracas, Venezuela, where he is a Research Associate
of the Phelps Ornithological Collection, reports that he has been particularly
successful with his birds this year. He has successfully bred the Black-
faced Grassquit Tiaris bicolor and his Yellow-bellied Seedeaters Sporophila
nigricollis and Blue-black Grassquits Volatinia jocarina, both bred several
times. A report on the breeding of the Yellow-bellied Seedeaters will be
published shortly and Robin is preparing a report on his breeding of the
Blue-black Grassquits. His Sooty Grassquits Tfuliginosa reared a youngster
to fledging, but it died as the result of accidentally becoming trapped between
the nest and the cage. This would have been a world first captive breeding.
At the time he wrote (September 22nd), his Ruddy-breasted Seedeaters S.
minuta had young in the nest.

THREAT TO SECOND BALI STARLING

<bodyText confidence="0.996128956521739" page_id="56266043"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
With the demise of the Bali Starling Leucopsar rothschildi in the wild
(see News &amp; Views Vol.110, No.2, p.91 (2004)), Chris Hibbard, Curator at
Bali Bird Park has expressed concern that bird trappers are now turning
their attention to the Bali subspecies of the Black-winged Starling Sturnus
melanopterus tertius. Apparently, although protected under Indonesian law,
the population of this bird is being drastically reduced by trapping for the
local cage bird market and it is reported that numbers are being shipped to
the neighbouring island of Java.
Chris Hibbard has pointed out that unlike with the Bali Starling of which
there is a large captive population worldwide, there is no significant captive
back-up population of the Bali subspecies of the Black-winged Starling,
only single caged specimens held by private individuals. This places it in a
potentially more critical situation than the Bali Starling. Therefore he plans
to attempt to gather together a number of these birds and establish a breeding
population at the Bali Bird Park. Once collected together the birds will be
individually identified, DNA-sexed and then housed in a flock, with the
aim of letting them establish compatible pairs. Many of these caged birds
have been taken from nests in the wild as chicks and hand-reared and show
varying signs of imprinting, which may complicate breeding attempts. If
behavioural problems occur consideration may be given to using Bali
Starlings (of which in May the park held 21) as foster parents.
